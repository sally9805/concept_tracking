 | man , said his friends , for Deborah bas Shebua had brought him a magnificent dowry  --  and he only a poor scholar , and his wife was famous for her grace , charming smile , learning and style , and had been educated by private tutors in Jerusalem , and was the delight of her father 's eyes . She was tall and winsome and had a lovely bosom and the hands and feet of a Greek statue , and her garments draped themselves about her figure as if grateful for the lovely opportunity . She was nineteen years old and had given birth to three children , the first two dead at birth , and girls , and the third surviving , a son , now in his cradle . She had a very pale and oval face and her complexion was like marble and her mouth was a folded rose , her chin firm and dimpled , her nose daintily carved . Her stola , arranged in the Roman fashion , was blue with golden embroidery , and her feet were shod in gilded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veritable aura of beauty , a shadow of lucent light . A young Roman of great family and of a rich and ancient house had sought her hand in marriage , and she had desired him also . But tiresome superstitions and prejudices had eventually intervened , and she had been bestowed on Hillel ben Borush , a poor young man famous for his piety and learning , and of an old and honored house . Alas , thought Deborah , that even her cosmopolitan father had let dead traditions prevail . How most unfortunate for the young ! The old refuse to believe that the world changes and the musty gods die , and the temples fall in on themselves in rubble and the altars are overthrown and the names upon them obliterated , and the worshipers are no more . She , herself , was a victim of tradition and arcane ideas now rejected . She had been born before her time . But it was possible that her son would live in a new world of urbane laughter and enlightenment , in an environment where man 's sole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now asserted . The very idea of a God was tedious and absurd in these sophisticated days , and embarrassing . It could not be reconciled with objective phenomena . She , Deborah , was determined that her son 's mind would not be filmed over with superstitions , like an old mirror clouded with antiquated dust and the smearings of unwashed hands . " Saul , " said Hillel ben Borush . " Eheu ! " cried Deborah . " Saul ! It is not a distinguished name , to our friends . " " Saul , " said Hillel . " He is a lion of God . " Deborah considered , her ruddy brows drawn together . She hastily relaxed them , for frowning brought wrinkles which even honey and  | almond meal could not lighten . She was a lady , and ladies do not dispute violently with husbands , no matter how foolish . " Paulus , " she said . " Surely there can be no objection , my husband . Paulus is the Roman translation . " " Saul ben Hillel , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled musingly . It had an aristocratic sound , Greek as well as Roman . " Saul of Tarshish , " said Hillel . " Paulus of Tarsus , " said Deborah . " Only barbarians call Tarsus Tarshish . " Hillel smiled , and his smile was gentle and winning even to his young wife , for it was filled with tenderness as well as amusement . He put his hand on her shoulder . One must humor women . " It is the same , " he said . He thought Deborah enchanting . He also thought her stupid . But that , regrettably , was doubtless due to having been born to Sadducee parents , who were very shallow and unlearned in the matters which were pleasing to God , and to please God was the reason a man was born and lived and had his being . There was none else . He often pitied the Sadducees , whose lives were firmly fixed in a secular world and who accepted nothing that could not be proved by their five senses , and who mistook mere learning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be , he thought , like a man being born unable to detect the infinite hues and colors and tints of the world , and so had been robbed of mystery and delight and the endless joy of conjecture and meditation , and the majesty of wonder . He often marveled how men could endure a world without God . Such a world was populated only with animals , whose lives are meaningless . " Of what are you thinking ? " said Deborah with suspicion , for she disliked her husband 's expression when he was communing with himself . It made her uneasy and too conscious of her youth in comparison with his thirty years . " I am a Pharisee , " he replied , " and we believe in reincarnation . So I was contemplating our son 's former existence , and from whence he came , and why he is here with us now . " Deborah arched her pretty brows in scorn . " That is nonsense , " she said . " He is flesh of our flesh and bone of our bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none like him before , nor will there ever be again one like him . " " True , " said Hillel ben Borush . " God never repeats Himself , no , not even in a leaf or a blade of grass . All souls are unique from the beginning , but that does not deny that if they are eternal  --  as we assert-  | their lives must be eternal also , moving from flesh to flesh as God wills . The acquisition of knowledge never ends . Its imperative is not ended in the tomb . " Deborah yawned . Tomorrow she must go to the Temple for the presentation of her son , and the thought annoyed her . It is true that the Sadducees also obeyed the ancient law , but they laughed at it secretly , though honoring it as a tradition . How could she explain the ceremony to her Greek and Roman friends in Tarsus ? They would be amused . She discontentedly smoothed a fold in her stola , and looked with a small resentment at her son . Hillel knew why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not believe in any life everlasting , or even in a God , and were purely secular and worldly , but they were often insistent on their daughters marrying a pious man . They were like men who prudently invested in what they sheepishly considered might eventually prove a good investment . Or they gave their daughters as hostages to a God in Whom they did not believe , but Who might astoundingly exist , and Who was rumored to be wrathful . Hillel had large and shimmering brown eyes , a white and ascetic face , a prominent nose like the Hittites , a golden beard and golden brows , and a domed forehead from which rose the gilded crest of his hair , partly covered now with the skullcap which exasperated Deborah . He had broad shoulders and strong white hands and sturdy legs , but he was not so tall as his wife . This also made her discontented . Had not a Grecian gentleman bowed to her once and quoted Homer : " Daughter of the gods , divinely tall , and most divinely fair ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ears and invariably his prayer shawl  --  or so it seemed to young Deborah  --  for he was constantly praying . The ceremonies of Judaic life were profoundly baffling to her , as well as almost completely unknown . Times changed ; the world moved ; the truths of yesterday were the laughter of today . God was a quaint hypothesis , interchangeable with the gods of Greece and Rome , with a slight flavor of Babylon and Egypt . It was a serene and laughing household in Jerusalem , where Deborah had been born , a cosmopolitan household . She regretted leaving it for this household where Pharisees moved and debated gravely and looked at her with covert disapproval and averted eyes , almost as if she were a member of the Ionian courtesans , like Aspasia . Once Deborah had said to her husband , " Do you consider me another Aspasia ? " She never understood why he had burst into the wild-  | est laughter she had ever heard , and had then embraced her tenderly and had said , " No , my darling . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screeched furiously outside . He was very jealous of the black swans in the spring-fed pond in the garden , for he knew that they were greatly admired . Hillel winced ; he had sensitive hearing . He said with an absent sense of caution , " That creature sounds like an illtempered woman . He has awakened the child . " Deborah felt a thrill of unkindness toward her husband for this remark , which denigrated her sex . She lifted her head with hauteur and said , " Then I will remove my disturbing presence also , so you will not be reminded of women . " " Deborah , " said Hillel , but Deborah could move like a child and she was gone in an instant through the light and shadow of the columns outside , which guarded the outdoor portico . Hillel sighed , and smiled . He was always offending Deborah , who was an adorable small girl  --  he never thought of her as an adult woman . He had heard from his bookshop that a little known manuscript of one of Philo of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and copies were expected in Tarsus . He would send for one tomorrow ; it would please Deborah , and , alas , it would flatter her . She would not understand a single word , poor pretty child . On the other hand , she had admired a necklace of fiery opals she had seen in her jeweler 's shop , though had prudently caviled at the price . Which should it be ? Philo of Larissa or the opals ? Hillel , in mercy , decided on the jewels . Two heavily laden ships had made their way from Cilicia to Rome without encountering the enthusiastic and ubiquitous Cilician pirates  --  who had not been entirely destroyed by Julius Caesar and his successors  --  and Hillel had been heavily invested in those vessels and their cargo . He had made a handsome profit . Therefore , Deborah would have her fine opals . The peacock screeched again , and the child in his ivory and ebony cradle complained . The nursery was filled with the newly awakened scent of the night-blooming jasmine , though the sun had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall and on the white and black marble floor . The shadow of a palm tree blew against the wall nearest the young child , and he quickly turned his head and gazed at it , and Hillel marveled . A child so young , so newly born , and he saw ! It was said that an infant did not truly see anything but light and shadow before he was two months old , but of a certainty this child not only saw but comprehended . Hillel did not in the least feel fatuous and too fond as he bent over the cradle and clucked at his son . " Saul , " he said , in the softest voice . " Saul ? "  | The boy had not yet been named in the Temple , but a man held his son 's name in his heart before that . Hillel and the infant were alone in the large and gleaming nursery . Hillel 's face and golden beard shone as if the light of his own spirit illuminated it . He felt a passionate love , and immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one 's God with all one 's heart , mind and soul , and that love must surpass any human love for any human creature . Hillel hoped for a moment that he had not offended his omnipresent God nor incurred His wrath , which could fall upon this innocent morsel in his cradle . The child turned his head quickly again and looked up at his father , who leaned over him . As Deborah had said , he was not beautiful ; he was almost ugly . He was smaller than the average babe , even at his age , yet he had a broad and sturdy body , naked except for the cloth about his loins , and that body was not fair as were the parents ' but slightly ivory in tint as if he had been exposed to the sun . The nursemaids had mentioned a young Hercules , which had pleased Deborah , but Hillel thought of David , the warrior king . The muscles of the little chest were strong and visible under the sweating skin , like minute plates of armor , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , equally strong , were , however , bowed like one who has ridden a horse since childhood . The toes flexed vigorously and with a kind of rhythm , as did the square little fingers . They seemed to move with purpose , and not aimlessly , thought Hillel . He had a round head , virile and solid , but overlarge for his body , and big red ears . Unfortunately , his hair , thick and coarse , was even redder . It was not a charming tint , as was the hair of Deborah . It was that particular shade of raw and audacious color which usually aroused mistrust among superstitious Jews . Moreover , it grew far down the wide powerful cliff which was the child 's forehead , and this gave him a pugnacious appearance , like an irritable Roman . The effect of irritability was enhanced by his most peculiar eyes . They were round , huge and commanding , under the red brows  --  which almost met across a nose even more suggestive of a Hittite 's than Hillel 's . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cherry of a nose like a peasant 's . ) But the startling impression of the eyes lay mostly in their color , a curiously metallic blue , like the glitter on a polished dagger . The blue was concentrated as well as intense , and the auburn lashes , long and shining , did not diminish it . There was a strenuousness and force in the eyes , not childlike , not wholly innocent , but aware and stern . Hillel , though a Pharisee , did not entirely believe in the transmigration of souls , but he wondered now , as he had often wondered  | lately . Saul 's eyes were not an infant 's eyes . They met his , he was certain , with conjecture and recognition . " Who are you , my son ? " he whispered , with uneasiness . " From whence did you come ? What is your fate ? " The child stared at him , but not blankly . The mouth , the wide thin mouth like an exasperated man 's , stirred , but no sound came from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child looked away from his father and contemplated the dance of vivid light and shadow between the columns of marble . He seemed to be reflecting . Hillel felt a little awed . What moved in that infant brain , what thoughts , what dreams , what determinations , what memories ? The small chin , firm and dimpled and puissant , appeared to gather itself together with resolution . Saul withdrew himself . Gaia , the little Grecian nursemaid who was Deborah 's own servant , came briskly through the farther bronze door into the nursery , her sandals clattering quickly on the stone . She was hardly more than a child herself , but very competent , with her flowing light brown hair and pale eyes and merry face and lilting step . She wore a long thin tunic of a rosy cloth , bound with blue ribbons about her slender waist . She bowed to Hillel , who raised his hand in automatic blessing though the girl was a heathen , and he greeted her kindly . " The nurse awaits the child , Master , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her son , but Deborah had decided otherwise . No Greek or Roman lady suckled children any longer , nor did enlightened Jewish ladies who had duties and responsibilities beyond the mere demands of the body . Hillel had been extremely disappointed . He thought the picture of a mother nursing her infant the most beau-tiful in the world . Certainly his own mother had suckled her children and he remembered the warmth and tenderness in the nursery and the crooning and the evening light caught in his mother 's hair , and the round morning freshness of her body . He had raised no complaint to Deborah , who at this hour was furbishing her mind in the library , for he was too kind and gentle a man . He knew this , and deplored it . The old patriarchs had been held in awe by their wives and their daughters in the past , but alas , Hillel was no patriarch . So , without a word he watched little Gaia gather up the infant in her arms and he heard her remark about the condition of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she rolled him deftly in the linen sheet and carried him out . As the girl reached the door the boy suddenly uttered a loud strange cry , not a childish wail or a whimper , but a humiliated and disgusted cry . He  | seemed almost to be saying , " I detest my present state and weakness , and I shall not long endure it ! " I am fanciful , like all new and proud fathers , thought Hillel , and he went out into the outdoor portico and then stepped down into the gardens . It was time for his evening prayers in the warm and scented silence . As a pious Jew , he knew that these prayers should be prayed in a synagogue , but he and Deborah lived in the house her father had bought for them in the far suburbs of Tarsus . ( " My daughter is of a delicate constitution . " ) There was no synagogue under less than an hour 's energetic walking , and Hillel was just recovering from malaria which left his strong legs somewhat weak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a horseman , and he disliked effete litters , and though he owned a large car and a smaller chariot he disliked them little less than he did the litters . A man was made for walking . He would not have rejected a humble ass , but this Deborah would not endure , and Hillel was a man of peace . Men might talk of the unbending patriarchs but husbands were not so valorous . Hillel looked about in the calm and luminous early evening . His house , in the suburbs of Tarsus , was held in constant quietude , a tranquil hush , even when the slaves and other servants were working busily or laughing or singing  --  for it was a happy household . Even the discordant cries of peacocks and swans and birds of prey sounded musically here , part of the murmurous background of palms and citrons and karobs and sycamores and fragrant shrubs , and a gentle benignity appeared to pervade during the hot spring storms , and the roaring summer thunder . The house and its extensive and beautiful grounds appeared protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends who laughingly vowed that Hillel was under the loving guardianship of woodland deities and fawns and nymphs . Certainly the house was in a hollow section of land , verdant , fed by springs and little rills even during the driest seasons , and in the fertile and luxurious valley of Issus , that fruitful vast area in Cilicia Pedias , which had been joined to Syria and Phoenicia by Julius Caesar . The country estate rolled in the softest green waves about the house , crowned by copses of thick dark emerald trees which made cool hollows of refuge during the hottest days , throwing their shadows on dense grass and formal beds of flowers and small red paths or graveled footways . Here fountains , bright amber in sunlight , hissed and gurgled , the illuminated waters pouring from gleeful marble hands or from horns of plenty or even from the mouths of exotic little beasts . ( There had been a small statue of a little boy in one of the fountains from which  | the water arched , but Hillel had decided , in his Pharisee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to Deborah 's annoyance . ) Hillel , in keeping with the Ten Commandments , would have had the " graven images " removed from the fountains and grounds  --  images erected by the former Roman owner  --  but here Deborah tearfully and vehemently prevailed , and became so agitated that Hillel , always the compromiser , yielded . He also compromised by not looking at the graceful statues in grottoes and arbors and fountains , and avoiding direct confrontation with their classic and beautiful faces , but sometimes his naturally perceptive and appreciative eye wandered involuntarily . When sternly reproached by his more rigidly religious friends , he would laughingly change the subject . Unlike the gentle men , he could infuse a tone of quiet authority and character into his voice , which silenced even the most choleric or rebellious , and his brown eye would glow with a fixed and steady coldness . Once halted by this , the quarreler would never again contend for his own views or rebuke or criticize his host or master , but forever afterwards would hold Hillel not only in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the very center of the grounds , flashing blue and purple under the sun , and becoming a shield of silver under the moon . Here floated the arrogant black and white swans , and the curious and highly colored ducks from China , seemingly made of angular painted wood , who occasionally disputed lordship with the swans over the water . During the migration periods of red-legged white storks flying to Africa or returning , these fowls would often halt at the pond to devour the fish with which it was sedulously stocked , and the singing frogs , and the clouds of insects . The regal peacocks drank here , and jeered at the swans , and so did the small denizens of the land . Fed by clear springs , and released into tiny brooks and rivulets  --  which freshened the earth  --  the pool was always clear and pure , with its rocky little walls in which blue and gold and crimson flowers , and even ferns , grew with colorful abandon . Sometimes the slaves waded here on hot evenings , to the combined indignation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their young hands and then releasing them with laughter . The former owner , who had visited the Orient , had erected a very complex and ornate little arched bridge over the narrowest part of the pond  --  which had the shape of a pear  --  and it gave an exotic touch to an otherwise too formal setting . Dragon shapes and serpents and vines twined together in the teak of the bridge , and the animal shapes had eyes of silver or lapis lazuli , and the minute fruit of the vines were delicately fashioned of jade or yellow stone . The  | younger slaves would often lie on the arch of the bridge to examine with wonder and delight , freshly discovering new intricacies of the artist 's work , and marveling over inlays of carved ivory . There were small awninged retreats under the thick trees for refreshment , striped in blue or red or green , and Hillel came here to meditate after a twinge of conscience following his admiration of beauty . Deborah could also retire here with her friends from the city and from nearby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partake of fine little cakes and fruit . When Hillel would hear their high and tripping voices he would flee , though Deborah would later speak of discourtesy and the duties of a host . Hillel had a wise way of avoiding women . The estate had cost Deborah 's father a considerable fortune , which he was not averse to discussing with Hillel , and he had furnished it with slaves and other servants and had sent one of his best cooks to serve his daughter . " One must remember that my child , my sweetest only daughter , is accustomed to refinement and comfort , and could not tolerate privation . " This was accompanied by a meaning hard glance over the affectionate smile , and the father-in-law would consider that he had instilled meek acceptance in Hillel . But Hillel , the tolerant compromiser , would smile inwardly . So Hillel , this early evening , stood in his flowering , green and pleasant gardens , folded his hands and murmured aloud , " Hear , 0 Israel ! the Lord our God , the Lord is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lords , we praise You , we bow before You , we glorify You , for there is none else . " He pondered on that with his usual awe . " There is none else . " The endless universes were pervaded with God 's grandeur . The uttermost star was charged with His glory . The worlds  --  endless like the sands of the sea  --  sang His praises . The smallest golden wild flower , clinging to the rocky side of the pool , dumbly , through its color and life and vitality announced His power over the smallest and the humblest , as well as the most majestic , and His invincible life , His omnipresence , His circumambient pervasion . Each blade of grass reflected His occupancy . His altars were not only in the Temple and the synagogue , but in every morsel of earth , in the silver bark of trees , in the clattering fronds of palms , and in the rainbowed darting light of the wings of birds and insects . His voice was in the thunder , the spark of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His garments in the winds . His breath stirred trees and bent grasses . His footsteps revealed stone and mountains . His was the cool shade , the clusterings of shad-  | ows , the cry of innocent beings , the rising evening mist , the sudden exhalations of cooling flowers , the scent of freshness of ground and water . " There is none else . " Nothing existed but God . Hillel 's heart swelled with passionate exaltation . All exulted in God and acknowledged Him  --  except Tian . All obeyed His slightest command implicitly  --  except man . All lived in beauty  --  except man . All bowed before Him , existing only in Him  --  except man . Man was the outlaw , the rebel , the distorted shape that scarred the earth , the voice that silenced the music of Eden , the hand that raised up obscenities and blasphemies . Man was the pariah dog , the moral leper in this translucent mirror of Heaven . He was the muddier of crystal waters , the despoiler of forests , the murderer of the innocent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the saints and the prophets , for they spoke of what he would not hear , in the darkness of his spirit . Hillel preferred to think well of his fellow man , being compassionate and often reflecting on the sorrows and the murky predicament of humanity , but he could not always delude himself that man was worthy to be alive . When he found himself in this crepuscular misery  --  as he did this evening  --  a misery mysterious in its source  --  he would remind himself of the prophecies concerning the Messias , and quote the words of Isaias regarding Him : " He will deliver His people from their sins . " The few Sadducees whom Hillel knew and whom he welcomed in his house , smilingly laughed at him when he confessed  --  after an extra cup of wine  --  that he " felt " something divine had " moved " upon the world , that a powerful event had already taken place which would change the face of history and revitalize man with the Voice of God . " It is your voluntary seclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This world is of rock and substance and the power of Rome , and it is reality , fixed in space , and only madmen deny reality . Abandon the stars , my friend , and the Kabalah , and prophecies made by ancient prophets smelling of dung and goat's-hair garments and sweat . They lived in a simpler day . Today the world is complex and civilized and filled with great cities and commerce and the arts and the sciences . Man has come of age . He is a sophisticated being , a citizen of the Roman world , at least by existence if not by fiat . He knows all that there is to be known . He is no longer the VT of jejune fantasies and hopes and delusions . He knows what the stars are . He knows what matter is . He knows his place in the universe He is no longer superstitious , except in a mild manner , like the Romans . He feels no terror for natural phenomena  --  he understands it . lie has his universities , his schools , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these days , who dream of  | giving birth to the Messias , for they know there will be no Messias , and that that delusion was only the wistfulness of innocent , ancient men . We still honor those men 's childish wisdom , and find it remarkable , considering that they had no access to our libraries and our schools . But it was the wisdom of most ingenuous men , who knew nothing of the cities and the roaring world of today . " " A virgin shall give birth ? " But no one spoke of that these days , except a few old Pharisees among Hillel 's friends , and even they spoke of it as an event still shrouded in time and possibly only a mystical hope . Hillel felt alone . At midnight , he found himself pondering on his peculiar surety that something had , indeed , moved on the face of the world and that all creation was holding its breath . Once Hillel said to an old man whom he honored in Tarsus , an old Jew bent with years but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have heard from my female cousin in Jerusalem , who is  --  I do not regret to say  --  married to a burly Roman centurion . A good man ; I have dined in his house ; he adores my cousin and defers to her , which , in some minds makes him less a man , but I have never believed that it was a proof of manhood to despise women . In many ways he possesses a rough wit and much shrewdness , and contrary to popular belief that all Romans are monsters , he is very kindly and has much humor . " Hillel spoke diffidently , while his guest frowned at this doubtless exaggerated view of the Roman conquerors of God 's Holy Land . " He is also superstitious , " Hillel continued . " He had been married to Hannah for six years , but God had not seen fit to bless them with a son though they have four rosy little daughters and I long for such , myself . This was a sore sorrow to Hannah , though Aulus seemed singularly and happily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter solstice when the Romans were celebrating their boisterous Saturnalia even in Jerusalem  --  they are restrained , however , on command of Caesar Augustus who is a sensible man  --  Hannah gave birth to a son . Aulus was consoling some of his men in a watchtower high over Jerusalem , for they , that night , were on duty and could not join the final night of the festivities , which he assured me are the mostpleasant  --  of all . It was a fine cold night , and Aulus was gazing in the direction of Bethlehem , the birthplace of King David , and all the stars were sharply visible . " Hillel had glanced apologetically at his old visitor who was accepting more wine from a slave and who revealed traces of ennui . Candidly , he was yawning . " A messenger came to Aulus to tell him of the birth of his first son ,  | and Aulus immediately poured wine for his bereft men and declared a festivity of their own in the tower . He was partaking of his third goblet of wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bethlehem , and then he saw a most amazing thing . " " He was drunk , " said the guest . " I know these Romans . They are always drunk . " Hillel was a little vexed . " Was it not David who said , ' Oil to make the countenance shine , and wine to make the heart of man glad ? ' He counted these as excellent gifts of God , and not to be rejected . Aulus is a prudent man . I have seen him drunk but five times . " The guest snorted . " There are abjurations in the Holy Books against drunkenness . There is the case of Noe . What does your friend know of Noe ? " Hillel said , " I was not speaking of Noe . Aulus looked at the bright cold sky over Bethlehem on its hills and he saw a most remarkable sight . Among the stars was a star such as men have never seen before , brilliant and huge as a full moon and restless , turning and burning with a white fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your Aulus was indeed drunk , or he had observed what the astrologers call a nova  --  a new star . It is a phenomenon not unusual . " " Stars do not destroy themselves in one burst of flame in a twinkling , " said Hillel , with a light flush on his fair cheek at this dismissal of his exciting story . " And if a nova appears , it is at least visible on successive nights for a considerable time . It is true that the star endured for a number of days , and then disappeared , but not in a fading or diminishing . It ended abruptly as if its mission was accomplished . For , you see , my dear old friend , it ceased its movements on that first night and remained suspended like a mighty cluster of great stars over a certain spot . It remained fixed , vivid and unchanging , at rest , until it disappeared as quickly as it had appeared . I heard that the light of it was so powerful and intense that it cast shadows as defined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awe and fear in the surrounding country . " " I , too , " said the guest , shrugging , " have relatives in Jerusalem , and they did not see this astonishing star . " " It was midnight , or later , " said Hillel , " and how many are there now among men who lift their eyes from the world and consider the stars ? " " True , " said the guest . " Aulus was convinced that a great hero had been born , " said Hillel , " a great warrior , though he doubted that this had occurred in Bethle-  | hem , a poor little farming and market town . Hannah , on being told of this by her husband , declared it heralded the birth of their son . " The guest raised exasperated eyes to the ornate ceiling of the dining room , and groaned , " The fantasies of women ! Now your revered young cousin will declare she gave birth to the Messias ! " No , " said Hillel , still somewhat vexed , but smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has also known a man . She is inclined to believe in a prophet though not in one of Aulus ' heroes . " " There must have been several thousand infants born on that night in Jerusalem and Bethlehem , " said the guest . " Who is the prophet , or the hero ? " Hillel stared at his folded hands , which he was resting on the white linen of the dining cloth . " I do not know , " he murmured . " But when I received Hannah 's letter a most mysterious joy seized me , an exaltation , and this I do not understand . It was as if an angel had touched me . " The guest chortled rustily and shook his head . " I have heard from your father and your grandfather , Hillel ben Borush , that you were always a mystical boy , and that you implored to be introduced to the hidden wisdom of the Kabalah . It is my opinion that this was a mistake , and I trust you will forgive me . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Kabalah , the cold if thoughtful mind , and perhaps even the skeptical , but of a certainty not the emotional and susceptible . " Hillel had been angered at this dryly amused dismissal of his story and so had changed the subject . He had also felt foolish and demeaned . He spoke of it no longer to anyone . But he thought frequently of the star . Some fear , some reticence , had prevented him from writing others in Jerusalem about the star , notably his relatives , for he did not wish to be disillusioned . This also surprised him , for he was a man who deplored illusions in others and had a gentle disdain for them . But it had been prophesied ages ago that the Messias , of the House of David , Himself , would be born in Bethlehem . However , if this were so , why had there been no shouting angels , no universal trumpets of the heavens , when that star had appeared , and why had not the world been swept up in rejoicing splendor ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for His throne was on holy Sion , as the prophecies related , and He would not be born as the least of men , the King of Kings . Too , several years had passed , and there had been no other sign . Still , Hillel could not forget the star , though he often wondered at  | the convulsion of emotion which had seized his heart on reading Hannah 's letter . Even to this very evening in his garden the surge of mysterious rapture was as fresh and urgent as ever . It may all have been but a delusion , the fantasy of drunken men in a Roman tower who had observed it , or a wife 's ardent desire that her first-born son be duly recorded by Heaven . But still , his stubborn and devoted heart denied all this , and he did not know why . Perhaps , he thought , an illusion which affirms joy is better than a reality which denies it , or perhaps the presence of joy attests to its verity . As Hillel stood in his garden tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cry broke the smiling silence like an abrupt command , sharp and authoritative . It was not for a few moments that he realized that it was the voice of his little son , passing in the arms of a nursemaid through the colonnade . Still , he was shaken . The infant 's voice had reminded him of his own father , imperious and uncompromising and firm , even didactic , impervious to doubt , scornful of hesitation . It was absurd , he thought , as the silence was resumed . A mere suckling  --  and the formidable old man who had ruled his household with the mere power of his appalling voice ! For one moment Hillel contemplated the thought that his father had been reincarnated in infant Saul , and then he chuckled . How delightful it would be to smack the buttocks of a soul which had terrorized wife and sons and daughters in its former life ! Perhaps , in a measure , that would be justice . He returned to his prayers , and now even the noisy birds were still . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and reverent joy : " Oh God , You are my God ! Early will I seek You , my soul thirsts for You , my flesh longs for You in a dry and thirsty land , where no water is . To see Your power and Your glory , as I have seen You in the sanctuary ! Because Your lovingkindness is better than life , my lips will praise You , and thus will I bless You while I live . I will lift up my hands in Your Name ! " He looked now at the fanged mountain shapes far beyond the valley , the fantastic monuments which acute imagination could distort into the likenesses of monsters , of lurking dragons , of bastions and towers and spires and temples , of pediments and columns standing alone , of twisted arches and carved walls  --  all hewn of scarlet stone seemingly burning in direful fire against a sky of the most intense incandescent blue . The setting sun thrust them into frightful relief so that they appeared to be marching on the rich valley land in menace and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wide highway of flame . Hillel had seen this a thousand times or more , but it  | it ' never failed to fill him with a premonition , an amorphous fear , a heavy melancholy of soul . Now he heard Deborah chattering with her female Greek and Roman friends , and her voice was vivacious and trilling , the voice of a happy and complacent child . He shook his head a little as if in reproof , but in some way that trivial and lighthearted sound consoled him , and he knew not why he was consoled . He looked below the mountains now and saw Tarsus on the blazing river , a city of broken golden fragments struck with crimson . He had not been born in that city , but had come to it as a child with his parents . Yet he loved it as he did not love Jerusalem , the desecrated , the alien , the lost , the land not only occupied by military conquerors but , worse still , occupied by sons who had destroyed the heart of the holy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandon . When a city was poor it was occupied by faith and industry and hope . When it became rich and affluent evil entered , and the city was lost . " How have I mourned thee , Jerusalem , " Hillel murmured and entered his house with his head bent and his sadness on him again . " I assured you , Deborah , " a young Roman matron was saying to her hostess in the calm of the brilliant evening , " that the medal from Delphi would cause you to conceive a son . " " I wear it next to my heart , " said Deborah has Shebua . She hesitated . " Still , he could have been of a more comely countenance . " HILLEL , BEN BORUSIi , was entertaining guests at dinner . There was his old severe and Pharisee friend , Rabbi Isaac ben Ezekiel , and his brotherin-law , brother of Deborah , the luxurious gentleman and aristocrat from Jerusalem , David ben Shebua . At the foot of the long golden-draped table sat Deborah , the modern woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spite of Rabbi Isaac 's overt disapproval  --  she thought him a dull somewhat dirty old man  --  and young Saul 's tutor , the Greek Aristo , and Saul , himself , now five years old . She knew that her presence , the pagan Greek 's presence , and even the presence of the child , were resented , deplored and despised by the old rabbi , and this gave her a sensation of childish malice and amusement . As for Aristo , he was a Greek of discernment , for all he was a freedman , and he ap-  | preciated her qualities of mind and her sensibility to Greek poetry and her knowledge of the arts and sciences . The sun was setting , the dreadful and distorted fanged mountains rearing in scarlet beyond the open doors and windows of the dining room , the peacocks were screeching , and the hot air was heavy with the scent of flowers and dust and heated stone . Deborah could hear the newly loud pattering of the fountains , the mutter of stirring trees . She could see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointed towers of cypresses and the purple blossoms of the myrtles . She was proud and content . Her house might not be the largest in this suburb , or the most splendid , but it was a work of art and taste . The dining room was spacious and square , of splendid proportions , with a floor of yellow and black marble squares , like gold and ebony , the murals on the white walls were excellent if a little " extreme " in Hillel 's conservative opinion , and the plastered ceiling was decorated in rosettes of gold and deep blue . The furniture , the chests and screens and tables and chairs , had been fashioned in the Eastern manner to be consistent with the environment , and were of lemonwood and dark ebony and teak , elaborately carved and inlaid . Here and there were scattered bright Persian rugs of intricate pattern and delicate hue . A fresh breeze moved through the pillars of the portico and brought with it a pure country aroma . Now the bells of " heathen " temples dedicated to Serapis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Roman , Greek and Oriental pantheon , began to ring softly over the land , striving with each other for harmonious notes , blending together to create a background of sweet and nostalgic sound . Deborah sighed happily . Her pretty face was suffused with a glow of combined innocence and complacent pride  --  and stupidity  --  and Hillel glanced down the long table at her and loved her anew , and wondered , as he often wondered , why she did not bore him to death . Deborah 's brother , David , was , in Hillel 's opinion  --  which could be very acerbic at times  --  effete , ridiculous , pretentious and a parody of elegance . He was four years older than Deborah , and married to a Roman girl of a great house , and he lived more in Rome than he did in Jerusalem , and called himself " an emancipated Jew , the new Jew . " He was an intimate friend of Herod , himself , and a familiar at the court , and very rich . He had fine manners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auburn and blue coloring of hair and eyes , and beardless , of course , and fair of complexion with a Greek nose of which he was tediously proud , and a cleft white chin , and his figure was another source of his pride , for he was tall and slender . He was also too fastid-III  | ious , in Hillel 's conviction , and scented like a woman , and wore many rings on his long and delicate hands . A complicated and detailed Egyptian necklace , fringed and jeweled , hung about his neck and lay on his chest . Gemmed bracelets clasped his upper arms , and a jeweled earring sparkled in one ear , and his toga was of the whitest and most shimmering silk bordered with gold , and his sandals glittered . Hillel always tried to despise him as a decayed traitor to his race and his God , but David was so charming , so amusing , so smiling , and even so erudite , that Hillel invariably and helplessly was seduced into fondness for him on his infrequent visits to this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ therefore even worse than an uninformed heathen , but he was a scholar , equally at home in discussing the Torah , Philo , Euripides , Sophocles , Virgil and Homer , the latest scandals from Rome and Jerusalem and Alexandria and Athens , politics , poetry , the sciences , the stock market and banking , the state of the drachma and sesterce , the newest favorite of Caesar Augustus , the Augustales of Rome , rumors from the Palatine , architecture , archaeology , trade , commerce , and religion in all its forms , not to mention the latest fashions in living , clothing , dining and amusement . Once or twice , in sheer exasperation at so much sweetness and light and urbanity and composure and politeness , Hillel , the mildest of men , had attempted to provoke David into a temper or a sharp reply or a contemptuous gesture , but David never defected from his pose  --  if it were a pose  --  of a totally civilized man . He would never , Hillel would think with some unkindness , impose himself on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vulgar way with a tradesman , or dispute with a stockbroker , or pick his nose or rub his anus , though he had no objection to a naughty story and could hint of unspeakable vilenesses of conduct of friends and acquaintances . Reb Isaac , the old Pharisee friend , sat munching morosely at Hillel 's right hand this evening , casting dark looks alternately at Deborah , who did not flinch but loftily ignored him , and darker looks at the perfumed David . He would flap his hand when David spoke in his musical and cultured accents  --  in Greek , of course  --  as if waving away a cloud of inconsequential gnats , and he would make rude sounds as he chewed , and would gurgle as he drank the wine . ( A veritable pig , thought Deborah , without charity . ) Only when Hillel spoke did the rabbi give any attentiveness to the table , and stop stuffing his mouth with large portions of bread or examining each dish with intense suspicion as if it were poisoned or unfit for the pure intestines of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though curiously fat and shaped like a  | turnip , and had a long black beard without a sign of whiteness in spite of his age , and his expression was black and fierce as were his eyes , and his nose was deplorably huge and predatory , resembling a Phoenician 's . His clothing was of the coarsest linen , and of a dull dark brown , and Deborah was certain that he smelled rankly , which was not true . He was rich and learned , and feared in the Temple , and was often in Jerusalem , and spoke of himself as the poorest and humblest of men , and was arrogant , opinionated and intolerant , though very eloquent and wise when it pleased him . He was also what David called a " heresy-hunter , " and devoted ferociously to the Law and the Book , and therefore an anachronism in these enlightened days . Deborah loathed him . It enraged her to learn from her husband that Reb Isaac would not only instruct young Saul in the proper pious studies of a Pharisaical Jew  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul 's mentor and would choose his menial trade . He was a weaver of goat 's hair . Surely , Deborah would protest with tears , even a Septuagint Jew no longer believed that all Jews must not only be learned but must embrace a humble trade involving the hands and sweaty labor , no matter how rich and distinguished of family . It was ridiculous . Did Hillel , himself , now practice his trade of cabinetmaking ? It was true that it pleased him to carve a small chest on occasion , or a chair for the nursery , or a little table , but did he pursue it sedulously , as the Law demanded ? No , indeed . " One never knows , " Hillel would say mysteriously , but he never explained what one might never know . It was infuriating . Tonight Deborah was happy . David was her favorite brother . She was vexed that Hillel , when David was a guest , invariably invited that obnoxious old Pharisee to his table . She did not know that Hillel found both Reb Isaac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found himself irritably honed by them and relieved from his own amity by annoyance . ( Sometimes he wondered what it would be like to be a Roman , to be filled with materialistic certitude and no doubts , and to tread the ground firmly and not to discover questions in the earth . ) Between the two stones of Reb Isaac and David ben Shebua , he sometimes felt the rough grinding of an elusive answer which , he reasoned ? he was always reasoning  --  might not be an answer at all but only his abraded sensibilities become tender and sensitive and skinless . He looked down the table at his son , little Saul , five years old , sitting silently beside his mother . He smiled affectionately at the child , but Saul was listening to David with that strange intentness of his , which was most unchildlike . Surely not a handsome lad , but curiously ; I  | dominating for all his short stature , his breadth of chest and shoulder , his muscular arms and the strong bowed legs . His eyes had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled cold but brilliant blue enamel over iron . His audaciously red hair was cut in the short Roman fashion , like a soldier 's , and his big pink ears flared out from his round and virile skull . Deborah might deplore his Phoenician nose , and hint of wantonings in Hillel 's impeccable family in the far past  --  which was probable , Hillel would admit  --  but Hillel found that nose comfortingly manly and assured and positive , and he did not know why that should comfort him . He liked the boy 's hands , too , square and brown , with short square nails , and the brown sturdy throat and the deep rose on the broad cheekbones and the scattering of freckles on the low and pugnacious brow . Hillel was not sure about Saul 's mouth , wide and thin and mobile . It hinted of argumentation and obstinacy . All in all , the boy had a fierce and concentrated aura about him , a fierce quick way of turning his head , a rancor of temperament , which , Hillel reflected , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hillel recalled his daughter , Sephorah  --  whom Deborah had wished to name Flavia or Daphne or Iris and not some offensive Jewish name . ( Hillel had threatened her with Leah or Sarah or Rebecca or Miriam and so had quieted her . Sephorah was at least not unmusical . ) Hillel thought of his little daughter , now almost four years , with fond passion : A beautiful golden child , with golden eyes , and affectionate manners and a humorous dimple in her cheek . She laughed at Saul and teased him . Saul , who rarely tolerated anyone , including his parents , tolerated Sephorah and played with her during the rare intervals of his leisure , and reprimanded her , but could never reduce her to tears . She mocked him . Sephorah was not at this table , but in her nursery . Deborah delighted in her beauty , and wondered at the large golden eyes , and curled the child 's yellow hair and smeared her delicate complexion with cosmetics against the sun , and debated earnestly with her on the correct costumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and taught her to sing . It was one of Hillel 's few joys to listen to the young voices at evening singing , first some grave song of David 's , and then the newest light song which Hillel suspected came from the noisy gutters of Tarsus , carefully rendered innocent . Hillel did not know who was the more childish and naive , his wife or his daughter . At scarcely four , Sephorah would sometimes look at her mother with sudden seriousness , her gilded eyelashes rapidly blinking , and once Hillel was positive that the little one was pitying Deborah .  | Saul , naturally , wore the white Roman tunic of preadolescence bordered with purple , on which Deborah insisted . " We are citizens of the Roman world , " Deborah said . " We are citizens of the Kingdom of God , " Hillel said . Deborah thought this absurd . There was but one world , dreamed of by the ancients , ruled by peace and law , and therefore secure . " Ruled by the Roman short-sword , " Hillel would say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a safe world for her family , and that was all that was important . It did not harm , though she did this secretly for fear of Hillel , to make a quiet sacrifice in the temple of Juno , the mother of the gods and men . Juno was an exemplary mother . Reb Isaac always insisted that he desired and could relish " only the simplest of foods " when visiting friends , but it was well known that his wife , Leah , was a miraculous cook and had due regard for her husband 's discriminating stomach and supervised the kitchen . No one knew what Leah thought of her husband , but she had humor and her table was popular with Greek and Roman and Jew alike , and so all forgave Reb Isaac 's hypocrisy . But Deborah literally believed that he was a man of simple and austere appetite and so , when he was a guest at her husband 's table she invariably ordered the plainest of food . This delighted Hillel , who could be guilty of a gentle malice . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs , a cold boiled lamb saddle , some stewed artichokes innocent of oil and garlic and vinegar , a lank cabbage , cold bread , wilted fruit and cheap cheese and a most ordinary wine . As for David  --  the little pucker between his brows testified to his pain , and in this , too , Hillel felt some naughty satisfaction . He did not know which was the more offensive , the effeminate delicacy of David ben Shebua or the grim hypocrisy of Reb Isaac , but it pleased him that both were being punished even while he deplored his own human malevolence . It was the conviction of Reb Isaac that Hillel ben Borush while an estimable Jew of considerable piety and faith , and a Pharisee , had not that dedication to the Book desirable in one of his birth and education in the Scriptures , and therefore not entirely without worldliness and triviality . He suspected Hillel of some timidity in this modem society of materialism and brute force and atheism and cynical expediency and the disregard of the individual , not to mention the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once mighty and barbaric , and the corrupt Greek and his hedonist philosophies , who had  --  no doubt to the wrath of the Creator , blessed be His Name ? invaded the very heart of Holy Israel with his mores and his manners . ( P ,  | He thought Hillel one of those gentle souls who preferred peace to controversy , and complaisance to struggle . On the other hand , David ben Shebua was convinced that Hillel was , in spite of his amiability and wit and kindness , a harsh Pharisee at heart , ready to denounce and direct the stoning of any heretic , with the sure knowledge that he had the approval of his God . David was no more correct in his assumptions concerning Hillel than was Reb Isaac . Once he had said to his sister after one of these deplorable dinners , " Why is it that my esteemed brother-in-law invariably invites that miasmic old rabbi to my first dinner in his house ? " Deborah , who was always more vexed than pleased with her husband , said , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intuitiveness and petulance , " It is to annoy you both . " As David tried to converse tonight in a civilized fashion with Reb Isaac it was like tossing pretty feathers against a battering ram . Reb Isaac despised him . David continued to converse , and watched Hillel out of the corner of his eye . Hillel was enjoying himself , as he lightly partook of the atrocious dinner . Aristo with his pupil , Saul , at the foot of the table , was addressed by no other one , not even the disdainful slaves , for he was only a freedman , but he thought himself the superior of any at the table , for he was an Athenian and brilliantly educated . His clever black eyes , small and restless as beetles , moved from one face to another , and he listened , and he smiled in himself . Only he believed that Hillel ben Borush was the only intellectual man present , and he had the greatest respect for his master , and a sort of humorous love . In two years he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jewish law which demanded that a slave be loosed after seven years of servitude . Aristo had considered this with disquiet , and had consulted with Hillel . " I am free , Master , " he said , " in two years . Where , thence , shall I go ? " Hillel had reflected , with sympathy . A freed slave was open to all the vicissitudes of the free . It was evil enough to be born a freeman and to face all the wicked contingencies of life , responsible for one 's actions to God and man , responsible even for one 's thoughts . ( But then , did that not make man almost equal to the angels ? ) How much worse it was to have been sheltered and fed all one 's life , accountable to no other but to one master , and then to be thrown out into the icy regions where one was accountable to all ! So Hillel had said , " You were purchased for my son , and according to the Law you must be free in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Are you not needful ,  | in this world of multiple peoples and philosophies , to continue to teach my son when he is of an age ? Therefore , before the time is ended , we will visit the praetor together , and you shall be free as soon as possible , and henceforth you will receive a monthly payment on which we shall mutually agree , and you will be an honored member of the household . " So Aristo had become a freedman with a handsome salary , and he was , at this time , purchasing some juicy olive groves for the day when he would be old . But he never forgot that on the moment the Roman praetor had declared his freedom Hillel had looked at him with the soft sorrow of a brother , and had vaguely shaken his head . Later Hillel had said to him , " It is a fearful thing to be free before the Face of God , for the Lord , blessed be His Name , mercilessly demands all things of the free , but is merciful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " God is very whimsical . But do not the Greeks declare that also ? " Aristo sometimes watched Hillel ben Borush at his prayers in the garden and he would wonder . How stern and terrible was the God of Israel ! He often discussed the gods of Greece with his master , discoursing on their grace , laughter , gaiety , merriment , feasts and foibles , and their elegant adulteries , and their blithe and capricious interference in the affairs of men . Once Hillel had said , " To each people God manifests Himself in a unique form  --  though with this thought of mine you will not find agreement among the majority of devoted believers . He is protean . As the prophets have greatly tried to teach us , but to no avail , alas , God is a Spirit , without form and without body , omnipresent , omniscient , circumambient , in all things which live . He presents one Face to one man , and a different Face to another . We need but say , all men together , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though His manifestations are multitudinous and myriad , and who are we to declare , with anger and certitude , that only our pale vision is correct ? " " The Unknown God , " Aristo had replied . " We Greeks speak of Him . " " Forever unknown , " Hillel had answered , with a peculiar sadness . " Yet ? " He hesitated , and did not continue . But suddenly his heart had lifted as a leaf lifts and he experienced , momentarily , that strange wind of ecstasy he had infrequently known from childhood . Had it come to him first when he had been told of the Messias ? " No , " David ben Shebua was saying tolerantly to Reb Isaac , " I do not call myself a Stoic , but like Zeno I prefer the Cynic school , though he , certainly , formulated the Stoic philosophy . I prefer to call myself an Academic . "  | " Hah ! " said Reb Isaac , squinting at him . He tore a piece of cold bread apart and stuffed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the accursed baker of this house ? The bread had a flat and insipid taste . The old man scowled . ) He well understood that David was now baiting him as he had baited David , and he rose with some interior enjoyment to the battle . So , this smallness , this perfumed banality , thought him an ignorant man , did he ? " You are not even an Academic . You are a nothingness , for you have no real opinions of your own but those you have stolen like flowers in the gardens of your masters . You have no learning of intensity and deepness , for you have denied and abandoned the roots from which you have sprung . You are like a bird with a slit tongue , which repeats all it incontinently hears and renders it again , without comprehension . You are not a Greek , with serpentine philosophies , or a Roman with brutish hubris , and you are not a Jew with a knowledge of God and of man . What are you , then ? " He shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his black eyes glittered . David flushed with humiliation . " You are the betrayer of Israel , " said Reb Isaac . " But , are you a Greek , you man who is not a Jew ? Or a Roman , an Egyptian , a Briton , a Gaul , a Scythian , a Vandal , a Syrian , or any other heathen ? You will tell me that you are a Roman citizen . But that does not say what a man is , himself , in his heart and his soul . He is more than his house , or even his name . He is , surely , more than his wealth or his learning . But , David ben Shebua , can you tell me what you are ? " David had turned very pale . A thin shaft of brilliant sunshine illuminated the side of his face and for the first time Hillel saw that his profile was classic Greek in the short curled upper lip , the round full chin , the marble contour of cheek , and that his coloring enhanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time , that his brother-in-law had been so insulted in his house . David was gazing at the old man and deep in his blue eyes something like a spark was rising . But before he could speak Reb Isaac continued in his harsh and cawing voice : " My sorrow is with you , David ben Shebua , for the sin is on your father 's head and not on yours . When a man robs his son of his heritage , out of exigency or conceit or vanity or eagerness to be as others , he has done a fearful thing . He has taken certitude from his son , his identity in the nameless mob , the integrity of his soul , his joy in what he is and to what he has been born . He has taken pride from him , and without pride a man is less than a man . Do the Greeks accept you as a Greek , the Romans as a Roman ? You can not rejoice in the name of Israel , for you have spurned her , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you call the world . ' The Roman world ! It belongs only to Romans , and not to you , not the Greeks or any of the other abundant races which inhabit this earth . This they know , and have their own identity , which you have not . " True , thought Aristo . I was a slave , and am now only a freedman , but I am also a Greek with a glorious heritage behind me , and therefore I am a man above all other things . Hillel said , circumventing the very pale David , " What a man chooses is his own , and because it is his own , however we may protest it , we must respect it also . There may be a deeper allegiance than nation , or even heritage , and it may be that David possesses it . " " You speak nonsense in your beard , and you know it is nonsense ! " cried Reb Isaac , turning the black glitter of his eyes on his host . He swung his heavy shoulders under their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , " he said in a loud and peremptory tone , " and I will listen and will weigh your words and not scorn them . Tell me , what is your allegiance ? " Then David said , " To peace . " He stopped , astonished at his own words , and then his face vividly quickened as if he had come upon some truth unknown even to himself , which he had believed and had not known he had believed . " I do not speak of supine submission , not even to the Roman , though we must recognize that he rules the world and resistance is death , or worse . We must remember Pompey , in our recent history , and our Herods . Is it not said in the Scriptures that when the storm breaks the unbending tree is broken , but the bending grass lives for another day and another storm ? Let me think a moment ! I am a man of peace , and peace is not to be despised . I do not speak of the peace of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he accepts the inevitable , which he can not move . He must make his peace with reality . That does not bring a loss of pride . Once possessed of that tranquillity , a man can again live with dignity and even find worthiness in life . He can rediscover thought . It is civilization at its highest , and I hope I am a civilized man . " Reb Isaac had listened with all the power of his mind and spirit . A strange expression began to move his blackly bearded face , and now there was comprehension on it , and pity as well as wrath . " It is a compromise , " he said . " There are men who will not compromise out of principle or love of God , and will die for their fortitude . And there are men of another nature who must compromise . They have my compassion . " I lillel had been struck by David 's words , and he said , " There is noth-  | ing wrong with compromise , if the choice is between the evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however repulsive , is truth . It is far more dangerous to insist on what is not real or attainable , than to resign one 's self to what is . " Then he stared at Reb Isaac with that quiet and daunting look he could use on occasion and even the old man became silent . " Let us speak of other things , " Hillel said , and there was that in his voice which rang like a hard command for all its mildness . " Permit me , " said David , in a voice of pleading , " and let me have a final moment . I have not expressed my heart , I fear . What is my deepest belief is that all men are the same , and whyfore , then , should we separate ourselves into nations and tribes and cultures ? " " For the reason , " said Hillel ben Borush , " that men are not the same . God forbid ! If that listless day ever arrives , then all richness shall disappear from the world and all variety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , which adds to the color and the joy of life , and is a wonder and delight to others of different cultures . God has called to Israel to remain apart so that He will not be forgotten , blessed be His Name , and that His Laws shall have a pristine source to slacken the thirst of all men . " Reb Isaac said in a rueful tone , " We need not fear the disappearance of Israel . God will forever keep her poor and afflicted , so that she will not decay and die in affluence , as other nations die . " It was evident to Aristo that Hillel , the quiet and courtly , was now dominating the table , for even Deborah , so emptily staring at first one speaker and then the other , was impressed . However , the young Saul was eying his father with no favor . He was but a child , yet his intellect , as Aristo knew , was prodigious for his age , and he had unchildlike thoughts . Now his eyes , so metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . Aristo shook his head slightly . Saul had caught the climate of the conversation tonight and many of its implications , for great was his intuition . He honored his father , for that was commanded , but even as a child he did not believe in his father 's intellect , for never did Hillel forcefully offer or defend his opinions . To Saul that appeared lack of courage or conviction . Hillel was saying with a sigh , " God , blessed be His Name , speaks in centuries , but man , alas , speaks only in hours . How , then , can we be reconciled ? Man is to be pitied and not always denounced . I understand Job . " These Jews ! thought Aristo . They can not give their Deity a moment 's peace or let Him retreat from their voices ! No wonder He smites  | them regularly , in exasperation , as they are always complaining . Yet gods deserve solitude , far from the exigencies of men , and some repose of mind in the blissful depths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even praise . " We share , with God , blessed be His Name , our immortality , " said Reb Isaac , " so we , too , speak in centuries in our soul . " Aristo wanted to laugh . He glanced at David , who was moving his spoons restlessly , for he , as well as Reb Isaac , was annoyed at this meal . David was not interested in immortality ; as a Sadducee he had no belief in it . It was not even academic to him . He said , smiling his courteous smile , " The resurrection of the body , Reb Isaac , if I may interpose in this conversation , is not unique with the Jews as a doctrine . The Egyptians have believed it from the ages , long before there was an Israel , and so have the Babylonians . It is deeply engraved in all the religions with , perhaps , the exception of the Greeks and the Romans , who , however , believe in ghosts . " He laughed softly . " No one believes it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his contentious voice . David shrugged . " No man believes as another man believes , contrary to the Pharisees and all the prophets , Reb Isaac . " Now he barely covered his yawn . " It is probable that Hillel is quite correct : If all men believed the same it would be disastrous . " Reb Isaac , in his zeal and his intention not only to rescue Hillel from what seemed to be his lukewarmness but to prevent the contamination of a holy young mind  --  Saul 's  --  became urgent again . " You sophisticated men make simple things complex , out of your own elaborate confusions . God is lucent and of a boundless clarity . When He says , blessed be His Name , I am the Lord your God , ' He has said all that there is to say , all wisdom , all that any man or angel can dream of knowing . But you invent philosophies . " " Rabbi , we did not invent your endless and wearisome commentators , " said David . " They are always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to suit the occasion or to make an obscure point . " Excessively true , thought Hillel . Again , between the two grinding stones of Reb Isaac and David he thought he saw a flash of the incandescent flame of the truth , which neither of them knew in full . Nor did he , Hillel . He said , " God is simple . It is only man which is an obscure darkness . " Reb Isaac threw him an approving glance . But David said , " I feel  | that nothing is simple , and nothing obscure . Only thought makes it so , and often I am weary of thinking . " " And so lend yourself to Greek and Roman debauchery , " said Reb Isaac . " You Sadducees , who are one with the Roman , the greedy taxgatherer , the oppressor , who are destroying my people , forcing them into despair and ruin and poverty , defacing the Holy Ark , tearing the veil of the Temple , scrawling your graffiti on the walls ! " His black eyes filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessness of his people and his nation and his religion , within the sacred walls of Jerusalem . His emotion caught everyone 's attention , even Deborah 's . Young Saul 's eyes blazed with blue fire . " You laugh , " said Reb Isaac , to David who was not laughing at all . " But God will not be mocked . He will send us His Messias , blessed be His Name , and all the evil of the world will be swept away like a black fog on a swamp , and the new morning will dawn . " He spoke threateningly , waving a menacing finger at David . " Amen , " murmured Hillel . Then the memory of what he had been told of the great and awesome star over Bethlehem flashed into his mind . He hesitated , but there was a powerful impulse in him to speak . He bent toward David , who was negligently smiling at Reb Isaac . He said , " David , I have long wished to ask you a question , for you live in Jerusalem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was born . I have a relative in Jerusalem , who is married to a Roman , Aulus , a young centurion . He wrote me some years ago , or did his wife , that on one winter night he observed a magnificent and fearful moving star over Bethlehem ? " He paused , for Reb Isaac was regarding him with an impatient eye , for it had been he who had mocked the story of Aulus . " And the Roman thought it was an omen that his son , newly born that night , had evoked a manifestation from their heathen deities , " said Reb Isaac . But Hillel was looking at David earnestly . He expected David to smile , to wave a graceful hand . But David appeared thoughtful . " I saw it myself , " he said . " And many others also saw it . " He bent his handsome head and appeared to be considering . Then he shrugged . " But a burning meteor , as the astrologists reported , or a nova . It was a glorious sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a consuming moon . It shone steadfastly , for a few nights , and then it was gone . Like all nova , it had a brief light , a brief endurance . But while it remained it was beyond description , pure and white , fervent , turning , as if on a great axis . We gathered on the rooftops to watch  | it . Some of the superstitious thought it an enormous comet , about to destroy us . Some said the candles and torches in the Temple flared with a vaster illumination while the star hovered over Bethlehem . Some declared they heard celestial voices ? " David shrugged again . " It was beautiful . But it was nothing . " " And no one from Jerusalem went to Bethlehem  --  to see ? " said Hillel . Reb Isaac was silently scoffing , leaning back in his chair , smiling in his beard and flapping his hand . " No one at all cared to investigate , to know ? " David considered again . " One did , " he replied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart rose again as if on wings , but he cried , " Who ? " His voice , unusually vibrant and intense , drew even young Saul 's eyes to him in wonderment . His face was full of passion , of hope even he could not fathom or understand , of breathlessness . David 's auburn eyebrows rose in astonishment at this unprecedented display of emotion in his brother-in-law , who was always so temperate . " A young man , Joseph of Arimathaea , whom you do not know , " said David , in a soothing voice , as if fearful that all that inexplicable ardor might be dangerous . " He is my friend , of my age , an honorable councilor , who has , " David coughed , " admittedly been waiting for the Kingdom of God . He is also a member of the Sanhedrin , for all his youth , for he is esteemed for his wisdom , and the wisdom of his father . He is very pious , but also sophisticated , and a student . In many eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rich . " David paused and again studied Hillel with curiosity . " And , he followed the star ? " asked Hillel . " There was no need to follow it . It was there , over Bethlehem . Joseph went with an entourage . But once in an inn  --  I must mention that the inn was crowded to the eaves , and even the stables , because Caesar Augustus had ordered a census and the people of Galilee were there to be counted  --  Joseph left his servants and proceeded a little space on foot . It was reported to one of my servants by one of Joseph 's , that Joseph carried a small golden casket in his hands , a precious object , and that when he returned at midnight the casket was no longer with him and never was it seen again . " " That is all ? " asked Hillel , when David remained silent . " That is all . What more can there be ? I recall that I asked Joseph what he had found in Bethlehem , but he only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " A foolish story , " said Reb Isaac . " Your friend is very mysterious . Had the messenger from God been born that night , there would have been the sound of trumpets and the heavens would have blazed from zenith to zenith , calling all men to worship and to pray . The holy hill of Sion would have burned like the sun and the Roman would have been consumed instantly . Israel would have been raised up to the skies , a coronet of glory , all walls turned to gold , her battlements adorned with angels . The Messianic age of peace , joy , life and majesty would have arrived , and all men would have known it , would have known of the birth of the Holy One to a princess of Israel . Not a nation but would have heard the tidings . Not a sea but would have flamed in exultation . And He , blessed is His Name , would have been exalted and His Presence proclaimed from all the corners of the earth . " " True , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been prophesied . " Hillel bent his head and pressed his hands together in prolonged thought . Then he said , slowly and quietly , " You have forgotten the prophecies of Isaias concerning the Messias , and His coming : Who has believed our report ? And to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed ? And He shall grow up as a tender plant before Him , and as a root out of a thirsty ground . There is no beauty in Him , nor comeliness , and we have seen Him and there was no sightliness that we should be desirous of Him . Despised and the most abject of men , a man of sorrows and acquainted with infirmity , and His look was as if it were hidden and despised , whereupon we esteemed Him not . " Hillel raised his eyes and looked at them . " Does that sound , from the words of Isaias , that the Messias will come in glory and splendor and all will know Him , from the ends of the earth ? No ! It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Him , and He will be rejected , the humblest of men , unproclaimed , unheralded , like a thief in the night , with no panoply , no choirs of seraphim . And who has said that He will be born of a princess of Israel ? " " The Holy One of Israel will not come unheralded ! " cried Reb Isaac . " How then , would the world know , or the world heed Him ? He would live as obscurely as He had been born , and I assure you , Hillel ben Borush , that He has not been born ! For , has not the Lord , blessed be His Name , surely said that His Redeemer will wear government upon His shoulder , and that of His glory there would be no end ? To be born as Isaias appears to you to have prophesied , would be to live and die in futility , and to be unknown to all men . " " Then , of Whom was Isaias speaking ? " asked Hillel . " I do not possess all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dis-  | agreed with his words . " Possibly Isaias was referring to the birth of some obscure prophet . Let me speak of what he says concerning the birth of the Messias : For a child is born to us , and a Son is given , and the government shall be upon His shoulder , and His name shall be called Wonderful , Counselor , God the Mighty , the Father of the world to come , the Prince of Peace ! His empire shall be multiplied and there shall be no end of peace . He shall sit upon the throne of David , and of His kingdom , to establish it and strengthen it with judgment and with justice , from henceforth and forever . ' " Hillel ben Borush , does that prophecy , then , not speak of the grandeur of the coming of the Messias , and that all men will know Him ? " " It is possible that they will not know Him when He first appears to them , " said Hillel , and now his heart became heavy with doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two prophecies . " Reb Isaac lifted his eyes to the ceiling of the room as if calling on the Almighty for patience . Then he said , " The sun is setting . It is time for our prayers . " Young Saul had been listening to all this and there was now a deep glow in his extraordinary eyes which Aristo deplored in his heart , for he suspected zealousness and saw that the child 's whole attention had been upon Reb Isaac and not on his father . He , himself , had listened to these Hebraic controversies with boredom . Why could not the Jews be of ease and accept the birth of gods as the Greeks accepted them , and with thoughts of grace and lust and laughter , and not with proclamations of world government and castrated angels and judgments and justice and all the other dreary fantasies of gloomy men ? What the Jews needed , surely , was some of the arete of the Greeks and less of the formidable gloom of their bearded prophets and wise men . They needed lightness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dark and heavy figure , was leading the way to the gardens , walking with a resounding step between the beaming white columns , and Hillel was following him , and Saul in turn followed his father . Prayer shawls had appeared , apparently from the air . Aristo was alone with David ben Shebua . The Greek , as a freedman , waited for the other to speak , for David was looking at him gravely . Then David smiled and gestured slightly and went to a distant door and opened it and closed it behind him . At the final moment a dagger of sun had lit up his one jeweled earring and for some reason Aristo thought it pathetic . Aristo went into the portico and half stood behind a pillar , to observe . The gardens were lambent with mingled gold and scarlet light ,  | and there was an illuminated mist caught in the branches of the trees , and the palms rattled softly in the evening wind . Beyond , started those incredible red mountains , but now the sky was coldly green behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the east a crescent moon revealed itself faintly , like a woman 's pared fingernail painted with pearl . Birds held their own colloquy , but Aristo doubted that they were singing their evening prayers as young Saul had once asserted . Yet , it was a pretty thought , and poesy should be encouraged in the young . Saul followed the prayers of his father and Reb Isaac , raising his resolute boy 's voice in response . It seemed to him that a vast crystal trumpet had lifted itself to the listening heavens , sparkling in immensity , all its facets charged with a blinding light , and from it came sonorous sound as if the earth and men had come together in one Hosannah of towering music , in salutation , in praise , in thanksgiving . Chapter 3 " I DO NOT understand this matter of alms and charity , " said Aristo the Greek to Saul . " Certainly , Socrates recommended it but it was an astonishing thought to his countrymen and was hardly taken with seriousness . We Greeks understand justice . Aristotle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justice , equal and balanced with all other sides . " Aristo chuckled . " The Romans love dice , too , but for an entirely different reason , and they are no philosophers . " But let us consider alms . Mercy , though you Jews do not credit it , was not invented by you . We highly approve of mercy . I can quote you a dozen of our philosophers who esteemed it . But reckless alms , or even prudent ones , as a duty , is not to be understood . Yesterday , you gave your last drachma to a beggar near the gate of the synagogue , and he was repulsive to the eye and distinctly offensive to the nose . You gave it , I observed , with no open sadness and sympathy . " " I have told you before , " said Saul , with all the exasperation of a youth of fourteen years . " We are commanded to give alms , and tithes . It is a holy command . It is indeed a duty . What if the object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perhaps even detestable ? That is not to influence us . " " In short , " said Aristo , " you give because it is a command of your God , and not because you feel sorrow for the object of your alms ? "  | Saul 's red thick eyebrows drew together in a scowl . Aristo had the vexing ability to drive home a point , like a cunning nettle 's sting . The youth hesitated . " I know my father gives with pity , and Reb Isaac with a blessing . If I feel no response to the beggar , it is my hardness of heart , or my youth which time will repair . In the meanwhile I obey . But that you would not comprehend , my teacher . " Aristo considered and slowly shook his head . " It has not occurred to you , of course , that charity can destroy the receiver ? If a man knew he could not beg bread and a copper for wine , he would work for it , would he not ? " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You give because it endows you with a feeling of virtue ? " Saul almost shouted with his exasperation . " You refuse to under-stand ! " " I am only interested . " Aristo grinned , his lively lips spreading almost from ear to ear . " You know , of course , that in Rome , in the middle of their abominable Tiber , there is an island with a hospital upon it , for slaves and the very poor who can not afford a physician . You know , of course , that we Greeks have hostels for the homeless and the sick , and that our great medical university in Alexandria cares for thousands every year . But it is not guilt which inspires us to aid the infirm and the despairing . " He laughed a little . " Guilt ? " cried Saul . " Have you not told me so on many occasions , Saul ben Hillel ? " " Again you do not understand . " Saul 's eyes were snapping with angry blue fire . " You have the capacity to infuriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliberateness . Yet I have explained over and over . The guilt refers to our fallen race , to Adam and Eve ? " Aristo nodded . " We , too , have such a story . But it refers to the Flood , which is an historical event . One perfect couple survived . But they did not breed another race from their own bodies . The gods , taking pity on their lonely state , and listening to their prayers , told them to walk from the remaining little temple and throw stones after them . From those stones were born the Titans , and men . We , their descendants , if you believe the interesting tale , feel no guilt that we were born of stone , and that we are not of the race that perished except for that one perfect couple , whose descendants we are not . " Saul waved his hand in rough dismissal of the story . " That is only a myth . I am referring to the fact that humanity is a fallen race , without merit , through our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That is our guilt , and only God , blessed be His Name , can erase it and lift us from the pit of it . " " A gloomy story , " said Aristo . " Why should a man feel guilt because of the sin of his ancestors , if the story be true , which I doubt ? If he is fallen , who awoke him to life , and is not the Awakener guilty if the man is guilty ? Does a man ask to be born into this world ? Your God seems to me perverse , the Creator of evil  --  if man is evil  --  which I deny with some reservations . Your God would seem to me to curse all mankind for a sin committed by others , which would make Him less endowed with mercy than the meanest of His creatures . A vengeful Deity , and I do not approve of Him . " Saul said , " ' What is man that Thou art mindful of him , and the son of man that Thou visiteth him ? ' We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be worthy of His love and His salvation , which He has promised us through the ages by the merits of His Messias , and no merit of our own . We do not understand each other 's semantics , Aristo , because we do not speak from the same frame of reference . " " True , " said the Greek . " No man speaks with another man 's semantics , and meanings , for each man 's history is uniquely his alone and he endows words from his own life 's experience , which can be no other man 's . Yet , Socrates asked us to define our terms , ' and much as I revere Socrates I feel he was either jesting or guilty of a stupidity . My terms are not yours , and never can they be . " " You deny absolutes . " " So does any sensible man . Yes , I know Aristotle spoke of absolutes , but he meant the only absolute , which is God . I have told you of our altars to the Unknown God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subject of charity , of alms . " I have heard an old story . A gentle-hearted sage of some substance was riding on his ass to the marketplace , where he would continue his study of mankind . On the road he was accosted by a beggar , who asked for a single coin to buy bread . The sage was much moved by the man 's misery , and so he emptied his whole purse into the beggar 's hand . Whereupon the beggar , recovering from his astonishment , remarked on the warmth of the sage 's cloak . The sage removed it and placed it about the beggar 's shoulders . The beggar then quickened to the subject , perceiving he had come upon either an unworldly man or a fool . He admired the girdle of the sage and its gorgeous Alexandrine dagger , and so he acquired both . Then came the sage 's boots , lined with wool , and he was soon sitting in the dust avidly putting them on his bare legs and feet .  | " Rising , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and he was desirous of visiting a tavern there where he could spend the alms on food and reviving wine . The sage hesitated then , but recalling that he had a good house in an olive grove and that he was not hungry , and that he had friends in the city who would give him food , dismounted from the ass and with a noble gesture invited the beggar to mount it . The beggar avidly obeyed and sat high on the cushion and took up the whip arrogantly . Then seeing the sage standing in the road and the dust on his bare feet , without a cloak or a drachma in his purse , the beggar gazed at him with contempt . ' Begone , beggar ! ' he cried , and he cut his whip across the sage 's face , and merrily rode away . " Now , my Saul , could you guess at the sage 's thoughts ? " Saul blinked his red lashes . He eyed Aristo suspiciously , knowing that the Greek had him in a trap of words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then he would console himself with the thought that the beggar now had some comfort and money , and he would be content . " " If he thought that idiocy , then he was not a sage , " said Aristo . " Nor was he human . Saul , were you that man , what would be your thoughts ? " Saul stared at him with his strange eyes . Then his freckled , deeply colored face broke into laughter , loud rollicking laughter . " I , myself , would have pursued the beggar , dragged him from the ass , and would have thrashed him soundly ! " " Saul , Saul , I have hopes for you , " said Aristo , slapping the youth 's sun-reddened bare arm . " But what would Reb Isaac have done ? " Saul laughed again . " He would have judiciously counted out an exact tithe from his purse and given it to the beggar , and so would my father . " " You have me , " said the Greek . " Still , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even virtue can become excessive . A man who gives his all is as stupid as a man who gives nothing . You see , I defer to your burdened sense of guilt . I , myself , would consider I would be doing the beggar an evil by encouraging his beggary . " He paused . " There is another thing which bewilders me . I have heard your father , my master , dispute with Reb Isaac as to whether , indeed , your Moses wrote ten of your David 's Psalms , from the number ninety to one hundred . Of what importance is the author ? Your father has recited the Psalms to me , and many of them are beautiful if incomprehensible in part , and beauty is all that is important . There are many who say that Homer , being blind , could not have described the burning of Ilium so magnificently , nor discoursed so tellingly of the coun-  | tenances of men and women , and therefore he was only author in part of the Iliad and the Odyssey . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your father , and your mentor , Reb Isaac , and of what importance is it ? " " Your Homer was merely telling tales , or the real author was , but we are concerned with the question of truth , Aristo . " " Is truth more than beauty ? I dispute that . Or , in a more metaphysical way I would declare that they are one . However , is your Moses , from your uninviting heaven , calling on all Jews to defend his authorship , and David also ? " Saul pursed his wide and sensitive lips and considered . " You still do not understand . To dismiss the question casually is to belittle the Psalms , themselves . " " You Jews take nothing casually and lightly , " said Aristo , " and therefore you are an irritation to other men . Tell me , do Jews ever enjoy themselves , or is their wailing about Jerusalem their secret pleasure ? Must Jews be sorrowful so that they can be happy ? " " Our household is happy , " said Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have never heard much laughter in it , except in the slaves ' quarters , and even there they mute their mirth in deference to the Master . I have seen no gay drinking . I have seen no real feasting , though you have many days in which you declare you are feasting , and rejoicing . " Aristo rolled up his eyes dolefully . " Your father has his guests and after the meal is over they spread scrolls upon the table and pore over them and dispute until midnight and later over the most meager of obscure meanings of some commentator . Is that gaiety , laughter , joy ? I have seen no musicians here or singers . I have observed no dancings . Yet , did you not once tell me that your David advocated music and singing and rejoicings in God ? " " In a spiritual fashion , " said young Saul . Aristo sighed elaborately . " I fear you do even your grim Deity an injustice . Observe the world . Is it not beautiful , intricate , majestic , harmonious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the skies an awesome wonder at night ? Is not the garden of the world green and blessed with flowers ? Do not the birds sing and the animals of the field dance with glee in the spring ? Do not men and women love , and is not their love the loveliest thing in creation ? Does not sound of music linger entrancingly on the ear , whether it is made by man or the multitude of the voices of nature ? Is not all a delight ? " " The world is but a snare for our enticing , " said Saul , but he looked about the garden and a secret shadow of wild excitement ran over his  | face . " We are not concerned with the world , of which evil is the master , but with God . " " I still say you insult Him . Moreover , I have seen your father , at sunset , on the conclusion of his prayers , looking about him with a pleasure that is sublime in its innocence and happiness . He does not bend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He sees deliciousness in it also . He sees brightness and glory . The world is charged with the grandeur of God . " As Hillel had often intimated such things to Saul in the past , the youth became vexed . " My father is not a man of deep spiritual dedication , " he said , " and I say this without disrespect for I know he would admit it , himself . " " I think , my Saul , that he is more spiritual than you , though , frankly , I am not enchanted by the word . " He put his head on one side like an impudent large bird and said , " I have observed that the Jews and the Romans seem disturbingly similar , both concerned humorlessly with the absolute law , though , of course , the Romans for the last two or three centuries have not been too meticulous about it . We Greeks call them a nation of grocers . But I think they are a nation of lawyers , and so they have esteem for the Jews who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I have not told you as yet , " said Saul . " I am to go to the University of Tarsus , and among other things I will study the Roman law . I would be an advocate for my people . " " You will make an excellent lawyer . You believe you are invariably right . " It was autumn in the garden and very hot , and in the afternoon . The restless palms themselves were still , and the cypresses and the sycamores and the karob trees had taken on themselves a more shining darkness as the year waned , and the sky was a hard and brilliant turquoise against which the distant mountains , scarlet threaded with green , leaned and tumbled in their grotesque shapes . The valley had deepened to the ripeness of the days , the grass a heavier green , the fields bronze with harvest , and Tarsus , the city , spreading on the banks of the waters  --  now a flashing purple  --  revealed with clarity the whiteness of its walls , or their rose or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already circling like feathered wheels in the sky , preparing for long flight . And the figs were ripe on the trees in Hillel 's gardens and there was a scent of grapes in the humid air and golden dust and water . The year was dying , thought Aristo , but in death , apparently , there was a last affirmation of life . He looked at the gayly striped awn-  | ings scattered over the garden , at the cool grottoes , at the shining whiteness of the graceful statues , at the shimmering pond on which circled the black and white swans , preening , and the ludicrous Chinese ducks who took themselves so seriously and were therefore belligerent . The little bridge over the pond was reflected sharply in the motionless water below , and a young girl stood there on the arch looking down . She was clad in a very short tunic as green as the pond and her golden hair blazed in the sun . The fountains were scintillating in the too vivid light , and appeared to throw up long streamers like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ locks . Aristo and Saul sat beneath one of the awnings and they were sweating freely . A plate of fresh fruit stood on a rude rustic table , and Aristo picked up a plum and thoughtfully devoured it . His rough black hair was rougher with patches of gray , now , but his Greek body was still lithe and thin , and his narrow face was dark with the sun , and his nose was sharp and inquisitive and his eyes ever seeking . He looked at Saul , and recalled that Deborah bas Shebua considered her son hideous . Aristo shook his head in silent denial . The boy might not be of impressive stature but his body was strong and well sculptured and broad , and even the bowed legs added to that impression of vigorous strength . To Aristo , he was like some primitive fire god , with that raised and crested mane of intensely red hair , with those red eyebrows almost meeting above his eyes , and the virile low forehead and the pointed ears . A young Vulcan , perhaps , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for there was no lightness about Saul ben Hillel , no soft grace or elegance , but only an aura of power . Power , above all , was to be reverenced , for it had in it a terrible beauty of its own , reflected the Greek , an appalling magnetism , something which could inspire fear but was also irresistible . Even Saul 's features , the wide thin lips , the great nose , the hard firm chin , spoke of power , though the boy , at this moment , was stuffing his mouth with handfuls of grapes and licking his fingers which ran with winey juices . When Saul spoke one listened even if not desirous of listening , for he had a deep and vigorous voice , with a curious weight and emphasis to the syllables , an emphatic pronunciation and an echoing timbre . One could not call it a musical voice , but never , even when he was excited , did it resemble a girl 's . Nor had it been a girl 's voice even before it had changed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a very plain tunic of gray linen with no embroi-  | dery on it , sat apparently at his ease in his chair and was engrossed in devouring the fruit with gusto , he did not give the appearance of being composed or at peace . All his unruly and impetuous nature asserted itself in the ever-changing contour of his face , in the jerking of his eyebrows , in the quickness of his hands , and the tightness of his shoulder muscles . His hands were browned by the sun , and the nails pale on the short broad fingers  --  the fingers of a soldier  --  and his arms were large and muscular and sunburned . He wore the ring his father had given him when he had " become a man " according to the Jewish traditions , and it was set with a ruby as fiery as his hair , and the gold was plain and unornamented . Hillel had known his son , thought Aristo , and had chosen what best expressed him . To the Greek , Saul had a forceful and cogent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become frightful and intimidating . He set down his strong arched feet with purpose and certainty , and he could move rapidly . Had he height , thought Aristo  --  who had more affection for his pupil than anyone ever suspected except Hillel  --  he would be a veritable Titan . Then an odd following thought came to him : Saul of Tarsus was indeed a Titan , though but fourteen as yet , and the superstitious Greek  --  who denounced all superstition as unworthy of an enlightened man  --  seemed to glimpse the future when Saul would walk among men with authority and even with terror , hurling that voice of his into the face of multitudes . In what obscure cataract and caves and mountains of heredity had this prodigy wrought and drunk his being ? The gentle and handsome Hillel , the lovely Deborah , were very unlikely parents of this man-child , and Deborah was very petulant on the subject even before the youth , himself . If he was violent , he was never savage or mean or vengeful . He was disputatious but he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took an idea and elaborated on it , or figuratively mangled and tore it apart , but always objectively , with no malice and no scorn . Ideas of others might exasperate him , but never to denunciations of the other 's intelligence . He was always , he declared , being misunderstood . It seemed to him that it was not too much to ask to be comprehended , even if one disagreed with him . Saul , Saul , thought Aristo the Greek , the world will not edify you nor will it receive you kindly . Men like Saul might evoke a holocaust , but they were usually devoured with it . Aristo hoped this would not happen to Saul , though he had his fears . Therefore , he tried to temper that vociferous disposition , to quiet the rushing assaults of speech when they became too  | bursting , to instill in Saul that golden mien which was the mark of a cultivated man . The world was full of timid men ; they did not like boldness in others , for it seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who demanded that they pursue an argument logically to its conclusion , and use reason . It was into this world , thought Aristo with unusual sorrow , that this Jewish Hector had been born , all passion but no baseness , all honor but no malevolence , all duty  --  alas  --  but no frivolity . The world would not love him , therefore the gods must , and that is more dangerous . " The figs are very ripe and sweet , Aristo , " said Saul , noticing , with that sharp clarity of eye for which he was distinguished , the mournful expression on his tutor 's antic face . " Eat this , which is the largest and is covered with its own honey . " He put the fig into Aristo 's fingers , and Aristo ate it abstractedly . " Pigs , " said a laughing voice near them as they ate under the striped awnings . They looked up to see the young girl who had stood on the bridge . She smiled at them teasingly and threw back the mass of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , almost as golden , mocked their male gorging of the fruit . Her exceedingly pretty face , fair as a lily , and as translucent , was rosy from the heat of the day , and her pert nose was burned . Her eyes were hardly less golden than her hair and her pretty mouth was always smiling , or , if a grave thought flitted across her mind , the expression of her lips might change to seriousness , which , however , appeared to be instantly about to depart . A year younger than her brother , Saul , and only thirteen , she was taller and her breasts were delicately nubile under the thin stuff of her short green tunic . While Saul was as restless as a young bull , Sephorah was as restless as a flower in a summer breeze . She was already espoused to her cousin , Ezekiel , in Jerusalem , and would marry him on her fourteenth birthday , for she had reached puberty six months ago . " That tunic , " said Saul , " is lewd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , a modest Jewish maiden . " The girl glanced down at her long fair legs below the hem of the tunic . " Bah , " she said . " Who is concerned with modesty in this garden ? The day is hot , too hot even for a chiton . " Her legs gleamed like marble touched by the sun . She bounced under the awning and seized a citron and tore off its skin and sank her white teeth into the pulp . Her merry eyes surveyed them . The juice of the fruit ran down her chin and she licked at it with her red tongue . " I am thinking of not marrying Ezekiel , " she said , and thrust her  | hand again between Aristo and Saul and took a plum . She pretended to study it . Her Greek accent was pure and sweet , for Aristo had taught her , himself , whereas her father had taught her Aramaic , and enough Hebrew as was prudent to teach a girl . It was only when looking at Sephorah that Saul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he spoke disapprovingly . " It is not fitting for a maiden your age to display herself in a boy 's tunic . Where is our mother , that she permits this ? " " It is not a boy 's tunic , " said Sephorah . " It is mine , of a year ago . My legs became longer . " She spat out the seed of the plum . Her feet moved to inaudible music . " I think I am really a nymph , " she said . While Saul had been taught much of the Greek gods by Aristo , during their classical studies , he did not consider it proper that his sister should know of their lascivious beauty and their adulteries , and so he gave Aristo a glance of umbrage . But Aristo was studying the pretty girl-child with pleasure . " I think so also , " he replied . " Shameless , " said Saul . " Your knees have been bitten by mosquitoes , unbecoming for a girl . They are also dirty . Have you been crawling in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you where you go so secretly in the mornings , when it is hardly dawn ? " asked the maiden , reaching for a bunch of grapes . Saul , to Aristo 's surprise , colored deeply , and even his pink ears turned red . Sephorah laughed at him . " It must be to visit a girl , a shepherdess , perhaps , or a goose girl , or a herder of goats , " she said . She shook a finger at him , a slender finger running with juices . " Shameless , indeed . You steal from the house when it is hardly light , and only I see you and put my pillow over my face to muffle my laughter . What damsel is it , sweet brother ? " Aristo studied his pupil with amusement , for Saul 's coloring was deepening moment by moment and his face seemed to be swelling . The Greek took pity on him . Saul was incapable of lying , and a question would be answered by the truth and it was obvious that he was dreading such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite common for a youth Saul 's age , full of dreams and fantasies and strange longings , to go out to view the dawn alone , and to meditate . " Sephorah , herself , thought this was probably true of her brother , but she continued to tease him . " One morning I shall surely follow you , " she said , " and discover the dryad in the bulrushes . " " You are thinking of Moses , " said Saul , and his voice was a little  | thick . " And cease this talk of dryads and nymphs , and wash yourself and array yourself more modestly . " " Old man , " said Sephorah and ran off , singing , her white legs flashing in the sun . " A divine maiden , " said Aristo . " A veritable Atalanta . " Saul shrugged . " She is but a chit , " he said . " She has a tongue like an asp . " They sat in silence , aware of what had not been said , and when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had made a compact between them , a compact of honor . Saul smiled . " I love her dearly , " he said , " though she has no mind and is only a girl . " They heard Sephorah 's airy singing near the pond , a blithe light song that was no prayer of invocation but came from her child 's heart and her joy in life . Nevertheless , Aristo was taken by melancholy , as if a precious interlude was coming to an end and would never be known in just this fashion again . He imagined that a beautiful statue had turned and had shown another face , and it was a more somber one . The distant mountains were already wearing thin rings of snow and now , as the sun sank the wind freshened and the awnings bellied like sails . Saul , almost under his breath , began to chant that mournful and sorrowful song which Aristo knew presaged the coming Jewish High Holidays , and the solemn Day of Atonement when Jews repent their sins , ask for forgiveness and promise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own , and thank the gods that they keep Him ! " Saul 's faint chanting suddenly seemed ominous to the Greek . He did not speak when Saul rose and , with bent head , returned to the house . Aristo watched him go , and something dusky and premonitory but unknowable passed like a harsh wing over his mind . To him , it was an omen . Saul had become disconcertingly aware he had truly reached manhood a few months before this autumn day in the garden , which was two months before his fifteenth birthday . As the Jews had an earthy and realistic approach to life  --  though greatly employing symbols they almost never used euphemisms as men allegedly used figleaves  --  Saul had been duly taught the uses , meanings and duties inherent in sexuality from the earliest childhood . His father would have used a more delicate approach than did old Reb Isaac , who thought Hillel 's demurrings on the subject not only ridiculous but incredible . " God made us as we are , " Reb Isaac had said , star-  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very least . " We are naturally endowed with appetites , which must be controlled if we are to attain civilized manhood and walk proudly as Jews . Are we Romans or Greeks ? Are we Epicureans ? No , thank God , blessed be His Name ! It has been said that men have been given lusts in order to conquer them , and thus become more than animals who obey all their lusts . How , then , can we know these things until we first acknowledge the lusts in honesty and understanding , and then modify and use them in the service of God and man ? " " We Pharisees , " said Hillel , " know the Holy Commandments concerning all things , including adultery . We do not condone nor suffer violations . Therefore , we have taught modesty as well as restraint . " Reb Isaac 's black stare had ironically widened . " You younger Pharisees , it would appear , do not know the essence of the Law ! Tell me , I lillel ben Borush , would you say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caress or kiss a woman ? ' The boy would become confused and uncertain . But if you say to him , You shall not enter and lie with a woman when it is not permitted , ' he will know of a certainty what you mean , for children are not so pure and innocent as you would seem to suspect . They have instincts , and some of their instincts are stronger than men 's . " The old man smiled what Hillel thought was a diabolical smile but in truth was only an amused one . " We do not condemn fornication , my son , though we do not advocate it ! It is adultery which is the crime . Let us be men and not coy women . " Hillel , as Reb Isaac suspected , used daintier language than advocated when he spoke to Saul of " the duties of pious men . " Saul had then been but six years of age . He had studied his father in dutiful and respectful silence . Only his high color became higher . He had seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chattering animals and had thought nothing immodest about the matter . But Hillel 's hesitant approach , his open and gentle embarrassment , his pained slight +mile , had not only astonished the boy but had made him embarrassed in turn , and wondering . He already knew that men mate as do the beasts , but less openly . He had not considered that his sister had been delivered by some thaumaturgy or the visitation of an angel . He was already studying the Scriptures ably . Then the astute Reb Isaac approached the subject with bluntness . " We are warned to beware of the strange woman , in the Scriptures , " he said , " for it is said that she is the gate to hell . Stolen waters are sweet and bread eaten in secret appears to be more delightful than honest bread . If a strange woman diverts a man from his duty as a man , then  | she has destroyed him . Hark to my words , my son : A woman is far more powerful in all ways than a man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size . " He then became more explicit , in an effort to overcome what he discerned was the boy 's shamefacedness , due to poor Hillel 's stammering and circumlocution . In consequence of this determinedly brutal approach  --  and Saul 's own barely stifled contempt for his mother 's pretensions and airs and graces  --  and Hillel 's awkward sheepishness , Saul early acquired not only a strong suspicion of women but a far more rigid attitude toward them than even Reb Isaac could have desired . He never fully recovered from his belief that there was something intrinsically vile about the relationship between a man and a woman , and that even the propagation of the race  --  created to praise God  --  did not entirely condone it . Before he was fourteen he had almost concluded that God had been in error in inventing such a process , and that one more befitting the dignity of man ought to have occurred to the King of the Universe . Reb Isaac , never a teacher who avoided the truth , admitted that the pleasure of cohabitation was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instant , thought the old man obscene . Understanding this at once , from his pupil 's wincing expression , Reb Isaac had said , " It is said by our wise men that it is often fitting that even those pleasures which are permitted should be denied . But that is in the singular and entire service to God . My son , the Holy One has not created filth and evil . These come from the mind and soul of man , for has not Solomon said that man is wicked from his birth and evil from his youth , and that man 's heart is deceitful from his childhood ? God , blessed be His Name , sanctified the union between men and women , and could He have done so if it were repulsive and against our nobler instincts ? It is only man who has rendered the holy unholy , the pure impure , the endearing the disgusting , the joyful prurient . What God has given us must be honored , respected and enjoyed , but in moderation and in trust , and never immoderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is only one of his appetites , just as hunger and thirst are appetites . All used in excess is not to be forgiven lightly . " Saul said , " Yes , Rabbi . " Then he added , " I shall devote my life to the service of God . " Reb Isaac understood immediately , and he was disquieted . He said , " You are your father 's only son , and you will say Kaddish for him . A man who dies without a son to perform this holy duty is thought unfortunate . "  | Saul repeated , " Yes , Rabbi . " But the deep and obstinate Pharisee spirit of him made its own resolution . He was accustomed to rising before the sun now to make his way in the first pale and uncertain light to the small school of Reb Isaac , nearer the city . On reaching the bare and austere room he would be the first to greet his teacher , and they would have a brief and private prayer together . Reb Isaac had already decided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and so while he was kind to the youth he was far sterner , more given to admonitions and censure and warnings and counsels , than he was to his other students in the Scriptures and in the life of the pious Pharisee . Saul was a rare soul ; he was a vessel permitted to hold the Grace of God  --  if taught strenuously and led wisely . If Reb Isaac had any fears it was that he might not be wise enough and nimble enough and prayerful enough to guide this soul as it must be guided , and so Saul was often the anguished object of his deepest prayers . Saul was not given to boyish pranks as the other pupils were given , nor did he laugh and eat with gusto , nor was there any mischief in his eyes . He studied even when it was not demanded of him , much to the hilarity and taunts of the other boys . His humor was dry and caustic , and sometimes unkind though not intentionally so , and he had a brusque way of speaking which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them were sons of Sadducees , who were not entirely worldly and Hellenistic , and a few were the sons of Pharisees . The latter youths had , several of them , already decided that indeed they would depart from the ways of their tiresome fathers when they would be far enough in distance from the lash and the angry voice and the stringencies of parental purses . Though robust and muscular , Saul did not engage in the roistering of the other boys when relieved of the bench and the pen and the endless books . But his appearance was formidable and so he was not attacked even when considered the most provoking . However , he was derisively called " Red Hair , " and his bowed legs were discussed loudly in his presence . He felt no animosity or hostility toward his mates . Ills attitude was of indifference , and this they could not endure , and so they taunted him . He thought them vain and weak and superficial , and often pitied Reb Isaac for being their teacher . They had no true reverence for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were careless . Therefore , he , Saul , should avoid them , lest he , too , should be drawn into the pit . Reb Isaac often wondered if such an attitude was entirely compas-  | sionate . ( It is true , he would say to himself , that compassion could become mawkish and sentimental , and therefore a disservice to God and man . ) He had observed that Saul was gentle , even tender , with the old man 's grandchildren , who were very young , and so Reb Isaac was frequently perplexed . He could not reconcile such gentleness with such total indifference to one 's peers . Sometimes the old man thought that Saul was far deeper than even he guessed , and he humbly hoped that the Almighty knew what He was doing . Yet , he often wondered how the son of Hillel ben Borush and Deborah has Shebua  --  both charming and touching in their fashions  --  could be so obdurate even against innocent folly and lightheartedness , and how he had acquired his mysterious character and devotion . Reb Isaac @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Greeks averred , but now he sometimes doubted . What ancestral seed had sprouted his life ? Saul was of the Tribe of Benjamin . Reb Isaac pored over the history of that tribe to try to find an instance of rigidity of conscience  --  beyond the desiring of God  --  or perhaps a prophet who had met a severe execution for his expressed opinions , which had exasperated contemporaries . So far the rabbi had been unsuccessful . So Saul remained a mystery to him . Reb Isaac respected mysteries . They indicated the Finger of God . Still he said to Saul one day : " It is fitting that you devote your life to the Holy One , the Lord God of Hosts , my son , if that is your destiny and your desire . But you are young . God has not forbidden the young to enjoy simple pleasures and innocent gratifications , nor the society of friends . " This , however , did not seem to stir Saul . He said , " I often laugh , Rabbi . I find many things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my sensibilities nor arouse me to laughter . Must I , then , laugh , merely to be agreeable ? Is the approbation of trivial people to be desired ? " His energetic face expressed his passionate scorn . Aristo the Greek would have been surprised to hear Reb Isaac 's reply , heavily laden with depression , " You will be a wise son in Israel , Saul . " The words would have been no novelty to the Greek , but the melancholy would have amazed him , for he thought the rabbi wholly contentious and fanatical . On the morning that Saul woke to the full knowledge of his manhood the warm spring sky was still dark . He felt restless even more than his customary restlessness . He rose from his bed in his small cubiculum and then stood immobile , wondering what had aroused him so keenly . He was acutely aware of his young strong body , of the muscles in his belly and his arms and legs and shoulders . They had tensed  | as if about to leap . Then he put on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his shoulders . He went outside into the dark and silent garden , feeling the dew on his feet . Nothing moved , but now he smelled the furious and urgent fragrance of grass and tree and flower . I le bathed his hands and face in the fountain and he did so slowly , feeling a new voluptuousness in life . He looked to the east . A dim crown of crimson fire was brightening there but the sun was far from rising ; a gray shadow outlined the crown and silently spread upwards . Saul ran his hands absently but with a kind of fierceness through his hair . The strands crackled with energy . He smiled . A thrill of intense rapture ran through his flesh and he shivered with the delight of it . He began to walk in leisure toward Tarsus , content , for once , merely to feel and not to think . None had deprived him of joy in his youth nor treated him harshly , nor had condemned innocent joys to him , nor had darkened his days . Yet from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ uncompromising , disputatious and challenging except with Reb Isaac . However , on occasion , he had ventured an opinion or two in contradiction , but when faced with absolute Scripture and the Law and the Book he had retreated not in confusion but with dignified humility . The chidings he had received from his father who spoke so gently were not concerned with small sins or mischief , but with his firm addiction to study at the expense of surveying the world of grandeur and beauty and terrible loveliness . Deborah complained to him that he was no child , and then no youth . " You were a graybeard from you cradle , " she would say with her girlish petulance . " You will regret the years of joy which you have wasted , my son . " But Saul had his secret and consuming joy . He waited for the Messias , and each day he prayed , " Though He tarries and has not come , still we shall wait for Him in faithfulness and hope and gladness . " Often he prayed , " Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit these worthless eyes to gaze upon Your Salvation , promised through the ages , before they are closed in death . " Sometimes , when this prayer was particularly fervent it seemed to him that his heart was seized in ecstasy and he would fall into a profound silence in which nothing lived but the Messias and himself , and he felt the awesome glory of that Presence within touch of his breath . Year by year , surety grew in him that he would not die before he beheld that Face , and had lain at the feet of the Holy One of Israel in total adoration . What joy , what pleasure , urged on him by his gentle father , and even sometimes by the disturbed Reb Isaac , could compare with that Vision ? The world p  | was nothing ; it was a mere colored vessel awaiting the filling to the brim with the divine Essence . He could not speak of these things , no , not even to Reb Isaac . Once or twice he had attempted to speak but his throat closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to turn away . It was as if his very spirit would burst . The Messias would not be born in Tarsus . It had been prophesied that He would be born in Bethlehem , as David had been born , and that He would be of the House of David also , and the rod of Jesse . Therefore , Saul ben Hillel lived for the day when he would first see Israel , and go , himself , to the little town of Bethlehem to await the Messias , Who would come in clouds of fire and with the thunder of seraphim wings and with crystal trumpets sounding from every corner of the world . Saul left the dusky garden of his father 's house and put his feet on the straight and dusty road toward Tarsus , and the house of Reb Isaac . He would be very early this morning . They would sup together on cheese and bread and goat 's milk at the dawn . ( Saul did not know that the old man supplemented this meager breakfast with the fine stuffs of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The rabbi already knew how stringent was the soul of this young Pharisee , and he often searched his conscience in anxiety to discover where he , himself , had sinned , in being too rigid even in the Law . He could discover no sin . Saul was Saul ben Hillel , and God , blessed be His Name , undoubtedly knew what He was doing , and why He had created one who not only implicitly obeyed the Law but insisted on more elaborate rigors in the practicing of it . ) But Saul was not praying this morning , as , in the gray darkness he passed silent houses and curtained windows on the road . He could not , as yet , see the broad river which ran through the rich wide valley , nor even the mountains , but he heard , once or twice , the faint questioning cheep of a bird and saw an occasional dim shape  --  heard rather than actually seen  --  bursting from tree to tree . It would not be long before this road would be noisy and festive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eggs and cheese and meat and fruit and wine and vegetables to Tarsus ' markets , their twowheeled wagons creaking busily , their whips cracking , the patient asses trudging . Little half-naked boys would gambol about the animals , and be scolded by their bearded fathers , and would beg of those fathers for a copper or two to purchase some honeyed sweet or chopped spicy meat in a leaf carried in other carts . Then the dust would be bright yellow in the sun and it would be very warm , and the tamarisk trees would lift  | their wide green clouds to the sky and the river would be full of traffic , and the distant harbor would be crowded with sails and the sun would lie hotly on roof and wall and the stones of the road would burn through the thickest sole . Then herds of goats and sheep and cattle would fill the road on the way to market , complaining and bleating , and there would be fresh carts and wagons joining those on the roads , heaped with terrified and squawking chickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Roman soldiers on horseback would roar through the colorful throngs , who would move off the road , cursing , to escape those hoofs which struck fire from the stones . Sometimes several Roman chariots from the cool suburbs would race along the margin of the road , carrying centurions and taxgatherers and clerks and bureaucrats to their stations and their offices , and many was the bronzed and muscular fist raised in imprecation as they swept by . I'he Romans ' faces would be set impassively , no eye glancing at the ( lusty peasants in their rough robes of brown and black and red and blue and at their swart faces partly concealed by head cloths to protect teeth and lips from the drying heat and dust . No Roman deigned to look down into those wild black eyes with the curse implicit in them . But a pretty slave girl standing shyly near the gate of a villa would attract their attention and a light salute , or even a whistle , and she would wave her hand in pleased answer . Cypresses would stand in stiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glimpses of greening spring meadows and blossoming palms , and an occasional Roman guard tower . And everywhere would be the acrid scent of sweat and offal and animals and men on the seething road , and deafening clamor . Saul knew of these things . He encountered the same throngs returning from Tarsus in the evening . He tried to avoid the road , walking on the stiff grass , stinging his feet with nettles , warily watching for snakes and lizards , and trying not to hear the furious uproar near at hand , trying to recite prayers , trying to step around pigeons and geese . He ( lid not care to encounter the hordes in the morning . He was a citizen of Rome , but he did not love the Romans , who had enslaved his country . He did not love the people of Cilicia , though he had been born in their city of Tarsus . All was remote to him . Later in his life he was to say , " Never did I feel this world was my home nor my joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the land . " He would think : Truly , I always I loved God alone , with all my heart and all my soul and all my mind , as I loved none other , nay , not even my parents nor my teachers . My hours were haunted by God , my years knew Him only .  | Some time before he had discovered a lonely clay road branching away from the stony Roman highway , and on an impulse of curiosity he had wandered a way upon it . He never knew whose estate he then surveyed , with lush pastures and little brooks and deep trees and palms and grain and grapevines , nor did he care . But he came upon , without warning , a sudden rise of steep and jutting rock formations , tall and tawny in the early light , like a wall set in his path , or the great ruins of a temple . From an upper crevice like a mouth burst a narrow cataract of pure green water , which made a soft though thunderous sound . At the foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rising sun , was a vast pool into which the cataract poured down , and the pool was the color of lemons and curiously quiet below such turbulence . Trees of many kinds grew wild about the pool and masses of wild flowers of every imaginable color , and little poppies and daisies and ferns and yellow shrubs and emerald grasses and rosy vines . Then , as the sky awoke with morning the tumbled wall of rock stood against ardent blueness and scarlet streaks , and birds alighted on stones in the pool to drink and bathe themselves . Aside from the sound of the falling water and the birdsong there was no other sound . It was an enchanted spot , and Saul , alone in all the world , knew of it . The young Saul forgot his first morning prayers to gaze upon such beauty with wonder and delight . He took off his sandals and stepped into the pool near the edge , and the citron-colored water was icy cold but refreshing to his dusty feet . He lifted the water in his hands to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliant fish in the pond now , and saw that the pond wandered away into many little brooks and freshets on the earth , reviving the hot soil . Many times that summer and throughout the year he came to that place , and never was it the same , but as changeful as a prism , and never did it fail to give him pleasure and peace . It was his own no matter who owned it . In the early evenings , walking home from school , he would come here also , and study his books against the background of rushing water and calling birds and murmurous trees , and then he would remove tunic and sandals and swim in the pond or stand under the argent spray of the cataract just before it plunged into ripples and small waves of light and tinted liquid . In time , it became a hallowed place to him , where he could not only study but could pray with renewed ardor and understanding . The months passed , and he saw no other human being near , though sometimes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the evening or the far songs of slaves working in the fields beyond . Oc-  | casionally a small wild animal or a fawn or a little lamb would come shyly here to drink , staring at him with innocent eyes , and then leaving as silently as they had come . And so he arrived at his precious sanctuary this morning , earlier than customary , and the rocks were still gray from the night and the water had a more tumultuous sound in the absolute silence . It was very cool here , almost chill , and the cataract appeared to be speaking to itself and to the pond into which it fell . Nothing had color as yet . The earth exhaled a cold but vibrant life of spring , carnal and pure and demanding . Slowly , moment by moment , as Saul sat on a dry rock near the pond and waited to watch his wall of rock turn to fiery gold , the sky turned opaline and the trees and birds awoke . Now the flowers burst into tints and hues like emerging rainbows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fecund ferns and almond blossoms . Saul , delighting afresh in all this wonder and beauty of the senses , sat very still , all ears and eyes . Then he heard a slight rustle and the sound of disturbed gravel . He looked across the pond , startled . A young girl had appeared at the edge of the pond , and she did not see him . She was , perhaps , one or two years older than himself , and she was very beautiful and slender , and Jew though he was Saul suddenly thought of a dryad , or a nymph emerging from a tree . Her chiton was of white linen , coarse and spare and bound with a ribbon below young breasts , and her feet were bare and pale and so was her throat and her arms , as pale as moonlight on the snow of mountains . Her hair was long and curling and dark as night , springing about a child 's face of soft amber and rose , and her eyes , he saw , in that clarified illumination of early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled a new poppy . He guessed at once , from her garment and her bare feet and her timid movements , that she was a slave girl from some house he had never seen nearby , for she cast furtive glances over her shoulder as she lifted her chiton and stepped into the still water . She lifted the cloth high and Saul caught a flash of round firm thighs , as pale and lustrous as her arms . He had thought , in the past , that should he ever come upon another mortal in that spot it would be forever spoiled for him , and he would not come again . But he felt no outrage now at this charming vision , and he saw that the girl , too , thought she was entirely alone and unobserved . She bent as he often bent , to lift silver water in her hands , and she drank of it and then threw the rest over her face , and she laughed and shook her head and her long and heavy hair flew like a lifted mantle in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | slowly and her voice was no more intrusive than a bird 's call , and was all as musical . Then she returned to the edge of the pond and dropped her garment and she was gone as suddenly as she had appeared , vanishing behind the trees . Saul then became aware that he had been holding his breath and that his heart 's sound was louder than the song of the cataract and that his face and breast were as hot as if the sun had struck them . He was conscious of a fine trembling through his body , and he wet his lips . Now the scene seemed to him to be less beautiful for the absence of the girl , and lonely . He was not a child . He would be fifteen years old before the deepest snows appeared on the Tarsus mountains . He was no innocent , no babe , no ignorant lad . He knew that the girl had set him afire , and he knew what he felt was the first lust he had ever known , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgency . He desired above all things to touch that slave girl , or that peasant 's daughter , to smooth her blowing hair into quiet with his loving hands , to kiss those red lips and that pale throat , to hold those little hands in his . He wanted to hear her heart beat against his and to feel her arm about his neck , and her breath against his cheek . His loins throbbed , and sweat ran from his brow . He had seen pretty girls before on the streets of Tarsus and working in the fields and even in his father 's garden , but he had looked upon them with indifference . In some astonishing way this girl was different from all others and he believed that she belonged to him as the rock and the cataract and the pond belonged to him , and no one else would ever know her but himself . He did not think of the " strange woman " of whom Reb Isaac had told him , whose mouth was the gate to hell and all abomination . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him as natural and as good and as wholesome as the morning , and not to be despised or rejected . Now he was alive as he had never been alive before , as tumultuous as a young Adam who had caught his first glimpse of his Eve , and as wild with joy . And his desire was no more evil than the desire of Adam for his newly created wife , and was as innocent . " Of what are you dreaming , Saul ben Hillel ? " asked Reb Isaac that morning . " You are absent and your eyes are far away . " Morning after morning Saul arrived silently at the rock and the cataract and the pond , but he did not see the girl again for nearly a month , and she was there when he arrived , singing childishly to herself as she waded in the water and dashed it over her face and rubbed it on her arms . He had told himself that he had dreamt her appearance  | or that when he encountered her again her countenance would seem less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he watched her from behind a sheltering tree trunk , she was more beautiful than ever , more desirable , and the urgency was on him more savage than before to hold her against him and taste of those poppy lips . Some water had splashed on the bosom of her chiton and the cloth clung to her young breasts and he saw the swelling outline of them and the virgin nipples . He watched her , entranced , hardly breathing , and then she stepped from the water and was gone , as she had gone that first morning , and he heard no sound of her going . He saw her all through the summer , in the early light , and as the sun began to rise her dark hair was struck with copper and her round face glowed and her flesh was as bright as wet marble . Then she would leave , moving as light as a leaf . Despite his urgency to encounter her flesh , he did not display himself to her . For a long while it was enough to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire . His thoughts did not spring beyond the first holding and caresses ; he held them back as a man holds back untamed colts . And in that withholding he felt the delight of secrecy and a dizzying madness . He dared not anticipate , nor did he wish to do so . When the summer was full and ripe and the early morning was hot , he came to his enchanted place and the girl was not there . He sat down on his favorite stone , feeling profound desolation , though often she did not appear . Then , as he was about to leave he heard a faint sound near him and turned on the stone to see her beside him , laughing silently and with shy glee . They looked at each other , not speaking , and Saul caught the scent of her , as fresh as grass and as sweet as clover and honey . He could see the veins in her child 's throat and the rosy nails of her hands and feet and the half-opened red mouth and the gleam of little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she spoke in a trilling voice , like a small girl . " Why do you watch me in the morning ? " He felt his face swell and become hot with mingled embarrassment and joy . He replied to her in the tongue of Cilicia , in which she had spoken . " Does it vex you ? " She shook her head and her hair flew and she was delighted . " No . But it amuses me . Who are you , Master ? " He stood up . He was very close to her . She was not taller than he , and her lovely face was level with his . " My name is Saul , " he said , and his voice shook . " Saul , Saul , " she repeated , and he saw her little tongue tasting the  | name , and he experienced fresh joy . " It is a strange name . Are you far from home ? " She gazed at him curiously and he saw the welling and deepening light in her eyes and the polished whiteness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw the smooth downy wings of her brows , and wanted to touch them as one touches the feathers of a bird . " Yes . I am far from home , " he said . " I go into the city from my father 's house , to study with my teacher . " He had always experienced an awkwardness with strangers before , and a reluctance to speak until he knew them well , but it was natural and simple to talk to this girl as the high rocky wall before them turned tawny and gold and bronze and the green water danced down to the lemon-colored pool . " What is your name , and where do you live ? " he asked in such a gentle voice that it would have amazed his family . He feared that a louder tone would send her running forever from him , for she appeared so light and airy and nymphlike . " My name is Dacyl , " she said , " and I am slave to my master , Centorius , the Roman captain who is praetor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Fabiola . " She pointed to the top of the rock . " Their villa is beyond this , and beyond the meadow , in a grove of karob trees , and this is their estate and the noble Fabiola regards me as her daughter . " She gazed at Saul brightly and innocently , and awaited his comment . But he was fascinated by the form and scent and appearance of her . She was far more beautiful near to his sight than she had been from a distance . She seemed to vibrate and tremble with the young life in her veins and the beating of her young heart . It seemed to him frightful that she was a slave and that she did not mourn her state or speak sorrowfully of it . Romans did not release their slaves seven years after they had acquired them , as demanded by Jewish law . They sometimes freed them , but rarely , and to a Roman , as to a Greek , a slave was not human but was called by a word meaning " thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things have no rights , or humble animals . " Are you a Greek , Dacyl ? " he asked . Her eyes widened . " That I do not know , Master , " she said . " 1 do not know what I am , or who were my parents . " She laughed with a happiness that disconcerted him , and then he discerned that she spoke as a child , for she was still a child . " I am a Jew , " said Saul . " My father is Hillel ben Borush , and we live on his estate far down the road from the city . " Jews did not despise their slaves as others did , and considered their  | rights as human beings and immortal souls and treated them with kindness and charity and fed them well and respected their manhood , and filled their hands with rich coins when they freed them . They taught them to reverence God and to obey and serve dutifully and with pride . But Saul knew that only Jews did so . He said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had heard the direst stories of Gentile cruelty . The girl 's mouth dropped open in astonishment . " No , my noble mistress is as gentle as a dove , and her slaves adore her ! " This confused Saul . He knew only two or three Romans , and they only slightly and in passing , and he had scorned their powerful and arrogant faces and prominent noses , and would never admit , as his father admitted , that they strongly resembled Jews not only in countenance but in temperament . He said , " Is the praetor harsh to you , Dacyl ? " She laughed merrily . " No , my noble lord is very kind , though sometimes stern . So long as he is served obediently and without question or impertinence , he is just and generous . He will not pen-nit the overseer of the hall to abuse us . We love him . " " But , you are a slave still , and may always be a slave , " said Saul , more confused than ever . The girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So the gods have ordained , " she said . " It is my fate . It is not an unhappy one . What more could I desire ? " Then she glanced , startled , at the newly brilliant sky , and uttered an exclamation of dismay . " It is late ! " she cried . " My mistress will wonder at my absence ! " She ran a little distance around the pond , then turned gayly and waved to Saul , and vanished . She is not intelligent , thought Saul ben Hillel , the Pharisee Jew . She does not mourn her direful state . She does not conceive of it being direful . She knows no sorrow . She does not think beyond today . That seemed monstrous to him , to consider no future . A slave with no hope of freedom was tragic to him , and his heart sickened with a new grief . Men accepted the will of God , it was true , and did not question it . But such men were free . A slave like Dacyl was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no will but his human master 's , and so he was never free . Saul did not return to that spot for seven days and on each morning he told himself that never again would he return . It was too painful to see Dacyl and to ponder her ultimate fate . He had heard from Aristo that it was not unusual for some depraved and cruel Roman senators to feed recalcitrant slaves to the lampreys in their pools , or to torture them , in spite of new and languid laws passed recently in Rome . When ij  | he considered such a fate for Dacyl Saul was overwhelmed with anguish . Once he considered giving her money and urging her to flee , and then he remembered how young and unprotected she was , and he despaired . He did not know , until he experienced that despair , that he loved Dacyl not only for her beauty but for her innocence and sweetness . " Are you afflicted by some illness of the body or spirit ? " asked Reb Isaac with asperity . " Your mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is blasphemous when we study the Scriptures , the Pentateuch and the Prophets and the Torah . Your countenance is less colorful than usual , Saul ben Hillel , and your manner is listless and your eye is absent . " Aristo the Greek was more shrewd . He looked at the young servant girls of the household and wondered which one had caught the eye of Saul , and for which he pined . He saw no evidence of any desire or wistfulness . He knew that no girls were present in Saul 's school , and that he was always prompt in returning in the afternoon to his father 's house . But Aristo knew all the signs of adolescent love , and he mused . On the eighth day of absence Saul could no longer resist the terrible longing to see Dacyl again . He had told himself over and over that she was but an ignorant slave girl of no people and no ancestry , and therefore of no significance  --  for she did not even realize that she was insignificant . It was useless . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the voice of the pond where it rippled ; it was the voice of the spring birds . It was not forbidden Jews to love servant women . It was forbidden only to abuse them and treat them cruelly . He argued with himself endlessly . And so he returned to the pond , not walking reluctantly but running like a hare , breathless and panting in the gray light of morning and in the first rising heat of the summer day . His red hair prickled on his scalp . His sandals slapped the silent stones of the Roman road . Birds , still sleeping , awoke to a startled questioning as he raced past . A thousand questions had tortured him over the past days , a thousand despairs , but now he thought of nothing but meeting the girl again . His heart seemed held in hands of leaping flame . The pillars of the dark and silent houses near the road were ghostly in the dim and shadowy light . Only he was alive , and he was alive with exultation . Dacyl was in the pond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the water , her black hair dimly glinting with copper and her mouth very red . She saw him and gave him a blissful smile and lifted her chiton high and waded across the pond to him . Her  | face glittered in the first light because of the drops of water on it , and her eyes gleamed with ardent pleasure at the sight of him . He reached his hand to her and she took it and it was their first fleshly encounter and her touch ran up his arm like a bolt of lightning and struck violently at his heart . Then she was beside him , laughing , shaking out her garment and then they were face to face . It was the most natural of all things to lean suddenly toward her and give his first kiss of love on her moist poppy lips . They were sweeter and softer and more fragrant than he had dreamed during those last tormented days . He was afraid he had startled her , but then her lips moved against his and he was startled himself , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this fashion . Her breath was on his mouth , and he looked into her eyes and they were beaming and joyous . His senses literally staggered with ecstasy and his whole being seemed to burst into flame and sensations he had never imagined almost overwhelmed him . Then , laughing again , she drew away from him . " I thought you had abandoned me , " she said . ' Wretch , that you made me weep ! " He was overcome . " I made you weep , Dacyl ? " He could not bear the thought that he had given her pain . Then she was laughing again at him . " Orion ! " she exclaimed . " You are a mighty lover , and I am Artemis , and will set you among the stars ! " She touched his bare arm and his flesh involuntarily quivered . " How strong you are ! You delight my heart . Your hair and your countenance resemble Apollo 's , but your shoulders are those of a Hercules . Did a Cyclops detain you , or did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his sister teased him when he was too serious . She could make him smile and laugh as Sephorah did , but with a wondrous and more exciting emotion . He said , and his voice shook , " I did not come because I could not . " She regarded him with sympathy . In her slave mind men had sober affairs which were exceedingly tedious , and Saul saw at once that the explanation he had ready for her question would not have been understood by her , nor did she wish any explanation . What he had implied was enough . He wished to say , " I restrained myself , for fear of what you are , but returned for the same reason . " But Dacyl would not comprehend , and for the first time Saul finally knew that there were many minds , myriads of minds , which would be unable to comprehend him at all and all that he symboled . He had met incomprehension before in schoolmates and in his family , but he had thought it either  | malice or stupidity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly , or that others deliberately refused to understand . Now he suddenly felt the vast isolation that every man endures , alone in his flesh , and he was aware that neither the most eloquent in speaking or writing could convey the deepness of his motives , the complexity of his thoughts . All at once he was choked by a sharp and alien compassion  --  though he was not a stranger to pity  --  both for himself and the others with whom he shared his world . It was a world in which no one truly communicated with another , and in this lay the greatest sorrow . Not even love made a common language . " Why is your countenance so somber ? " asked Dacyl . But Saul had no words . " Let us be happy , for the day is fair , " said the girl and she took his hand and they entered the water together and laughed as children laugh and splashed each other . " It is good to be happy , for that state was intended by the Father , blessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaac had said . But in his heart Saul had not believed that men could be happy in a world of vice and licentiousness and depravity and terror , which he had seen all about him on the burning streets of Tarsus , a world abandoned by God and abandoned by virtue , and ruled by the short-sword of Rome and taxgatherers and other fiends of oppression and lust . Yet , in a single moment , by her words , Saul knew that he had truly heard the simplest sagacity . " Let us be happy , for the day is fair . " He had thought men could be happy only in the ecstatic contemplation of God , if they had any intelligence at all , and were not as beasts and other animals . But as he gazed with delight at Dacyl he saw indeed that the day was fair , and that she was all happiness for him . And so it was for many days of the summer and Saul became young in heart and spirit as he had never been young before , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embarrassment , but for fear that if he spoke of it the magic would fly from him , as Artemis , the favorite goddess of Dacyl , fled on the silver meadows of the moon . The girl sharpened all his senses . She gave incandescent meanings to the Songs of Solomon , brought jeweled subtleties to the glad Psalms of David . As Dacyl never reflected on the future , not even on the morrow , so he lost his own sense of time , marveling how deep were the colors of earth and sky now to him , how precious was every flower , how exciting every tree-form , how gracious every shadow , how keen every sensation , how delicious all food , and how glorious his dreams . A cup of wine was no longer wine to him . It had the color and the taste of Dacyl 's lips . It held the dance of her eyes . Now everything had a larger  | contour to him , a vaster meaning , an almost unbearable elation and gaiety . He found himself less attuned to Ecclesiastes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the prophets , during the brief intervals when they were not mourning the human predicament and man 's propensities for evil . He was certain , in his innocence , that no man had ever experienced such ineffable joy before , and he gave thanks to God for it . Yet , never once did Dacyl utter a profound word , not even the unconscious wisdom of the unlettered and ignorant . She did not touch his mind , but she touched secret places in him , which were wiser if more primeval , with the freshness of the first morning of creation . She regarded existence as a young lamb regarded it , or a bird , or anything else as simple and natural and serene . She was a rose and she spread her fragrant petals to the sun and gave of the divine essence of her perfume . She played with Saul as a child plays , and with all the fullness of a child , though she was older than he . She kissed him as openly as a child , and fondled his hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all , she gave him an awareness of all other human creatures , an awareness that was never to leave him . TARSUS , whom her inhabitants called " the jewel of the Cydnus River , " was essentially a Phoenician city , commercial , murmurous with business and traffic both by water and highways , possessed of excellent academies and schools , mercantile establishments , factories , perfumers , weavers , forges , endless shops , remarkable museums and music halls , the freedom of Roman citizenship , cursed with a bureaucracy , gleaming with temples to many gods , Hellenistic in attitude though Oriental in emotion , famed for her craftsmen , enriched by her pirates who lived respectable and respected lives in their fine villas , wineshops , baths , bakeries , carpet manufacturers , banks , stock markets , inns where Egyptian cooks served superb meals , brothels , licentious theaters , arenas for sports and gladitorial combats . Many were the natives who proudly called themselves " a little Rome , " for a score of races lived here and the narrow streets clamored with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , students from Asia Minor , Nubians and Scythians , Greeks , Romans , Egyptians , Assyrians , pale-eyed barbarians from the forests of Europe , slaves , Gauls , Britons , artists , jewelers and the owners of book-  | shops , scribes knowing a dozen tongues , physicians , and tens of thousands of the free mobs who idled , worked when hunger threatened , scrawled graffiti on the walls at night , vociferously adored some local politician and as vociferously derided him , haunted the arenas , hunted slaves , fought with the police on occasion , gave their measure of robbers to the streets , served any master , gambled , diced , pimped , labored , sweated , cheated and behaved as the market rabble has always behaved and will invariably behave . They adored actors and acrobats and gladiators , extolled them one day and put their very lives in danger the next , harassed unprotected young girls hurrying with messages for rich mistresses , and were emotional , passionate , dangerous , colorful , frightening , seething , amusing and lively , stinking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hourly blasphemed the gods , and paid taxes only when pursued by a resolute publican accompanied by slaves with staves , or legionnaires carrying fasces . They were the terror and vitality of the night , the vehemence of the day , and like all who live by their wits and infrequent labor they were exceedingly clever and full of wit . " Cities without a market rabble could not survive , " Aristo would tell his pupil , Saul . " They would expire of boredom , for respectability has a certain deadness and ennui about it , a certain lack of life . It is the market rabble , dexterously turning a drachma or a sesterce or a copper here and there , which enlivens and creates trade , inspires that greed which is the mother of ambition and fortune , raises temples , gives the gods changeful faces , stimulates fashions , removes the lead from the boots of soldier and police , forms a subject against which priests and teachers and lawmakers can inveigh  --  what else could they do ? ? and , if their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is lustre and should not be despised . Their charlatanry , their brazen robberies , their wit and their cavortings , their heedlessness and their lewdness , their cruelty and their frequent violent compassion , are closer to the real nature of man , my Saul , than are the sober-faced philosophers and the writers of books . It is the market rabble , in truth , which inspire theses and bookwriting and the best of plays , for that which is raucous and furious and even vicious has more verity before the sun than all of the old Greek virtues of continence , reflection , modesty and the Stoic imperative . This is something , " added Aristo , " which you will find angrily denied by those who believe even the common man can be greater than he is , or that any man can become like the gods , but then these sad defenders of the public weal and these fantasy-weavers are far removed  | from knowledge and validity and reality , and one could pity them if they were not so dangerous . " Saul thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contradiction , but since he had known Dacyl he was no longer certain . The girl , though a slave and protected , was of the market rabble also . He could not despise her . In truth , because of her , he saw mankind as it was and not as he had hoped it would be , and love filled him rather than repulsion . But he could not believe , with the smiling Aristo , that evil was as necessary as good , and that good without evil would . be a veritable hell of listlessness and dankness . He explained , over and over , the glories and the sweetnesses of the lost Eden , and Aristo always replied , " One should be grateful to your Adam and Eve . Not only did they set men free from absolute virtue , but they made them wholly human . They bore in their loins the beauty and the madness of cities , the great sails of commerce , the delight of theaters and dancing girls , and all the infinite variety of life as we know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a single color , like babes in their nurseries . They were also very wise : they forebore to eat of the Tree of Life before feasting on the Tree of Wisdom , for what man would be immortal ? " On this , they had always disputed , and Aristo , Saul would think , flourished on disputations , all cynical and full of skepticism , all sharp and laughing . But since the youth had known Dacyl he found himself listening more closely to Aristo who could give a keen edge to any discourse and fire the mind even if it disagreed with him . " You will notice , in Tarsus , as you will notice in Rome and Alexandria and Athens in the future , that we Greeks have given even vice a refinement which grosser races could never attain , " said Aristo . " All men are vile , as your Solomon has said , and is he not considered your wisest king ? But vileness should not be , among men , a muddy animal vileness  --  though I wrongfully denigrate the animals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gracious gods . That which you Jews call sin has inspired more poetry than virtue , and certainly more temples ! What would man be without danger and war and terror and harpies and furies and even death ? A sad little languid creature munching fruit under a changeless tree in a paradise on which terrible winds never descended nor any wave rushed nor any thunder sounded . Without controversy there can be no wise argument ; without dissension there can be no agreement ; without disaster there can be no peace , in all the meaning of the words . In a deeper subtlety than you know , Saul , wickedness created virtue , and all the arts , and vitality . Contrast , Saul , it '  | is the only thing which makes life interesting . And wine and love , of course . " Saul contemplated . He could never agree on a single point with Aristo , but Aristo , like Dacyl , awakened him to the many-faceted crystal of existence , and its endless colors . Hillel had attempted this , but as Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not attracted to the vice of Tarsus which he often saw . But he was less horrified and more saddened now at the sight of the tinted male whores he saw on the streets , and the cheap dissolute women in rough garments or in rich litters . He no longer averted his eyes from the incense-fuming " heathen " temples of a score of alien religions . It was true that all mankind seemed desperately , if joyously , determined to debauch the human spirit , especially in the hot streets of Tarsus , but Saul was less nauseated or made angry by this display of depravity . He pitied it , and pitied all its votaries . Not to these had been given the Torah , the prophets , Moses and Solomon , and the promise of the Messias . Or , if the vision had been given  --  witness the Greek worship of the " Unknown God " ? it had been nebulous and uncertain . Once Saul even entered a Greek temple and had looked at its marvelous and simple beauty and its heroic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowers and the charming vistas . There , too , he had found the empty altar , simple and plain and untenanted and inscribed , " To the Unknown God . " It waited for That which would give it significance and truth . For those who did not know what had been precisely promised the Jews , Saul felt bitter tears in his eyes . Hillel had often told him , " A Gentile is not less in the sight of God than a pious and reverent and devoted Jew . He , too , is a child of God the Father , blessed be His Glorious Name . He , too , according to the prophets , will partake of the salvation of the Messias . No man must be despised , nor considered lesser than another . You must honor his manhood , his brotherhood before God , you must deal with him justly and in honor , you must give him your compassion and your hand  --  even if he reject it . Diverse though we are  --  for the Father loves diversity , as He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind is all one . It has been said by Egyptian scientists that light , which appears to us to have a thousand hues and tints and is composed of endless colors , is truly but one light . And that light is the Spirit of God , and of man . " Saul had listened dutifully , and with the deep love he bore his father , but he had considered Hillel too simplistic and too devoid of the pride of a Jew whose fathers had been given a Covenant with God , and of  | whose flesh the Messias would be born . But now , as he daily walked the streets of Tarsus in the burnished autumn sunlight , he felt less pride than compassion , and he wondered why it was that other men had not been enlightened also . The Greeks had had their moral code , and so had the Romans and the Egyptians , but it had been a code rooted in some ethical principle and not in the Ancient of Days . Ethical principles devoid of a Source could be destroyed or abandoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never be moved . Love , though he did not know it , had given him not only a sense of completely belonging to all humanity , but a tender and powerful pity for it . And , sorrowfully , in the end  --  because he was still very young and inexperienced and had no confidant  --  love brought him a terror and a wrath and a disillusionment from which he was never completely to recover , and which was to haunt all his life , and cause him agony , and confound and baffle those necessary to him . In all his short life Saul had never seen a morning so absolutely golden , so resonant with aureate tints and shades , so tawny and ebullient and life-compelling , though it was autumn and the dying year . The darkness of the cypresses emphasized the fiery yellow of other trees ; tamarisks were still green but their boughs were gilded with the first topaz sun . Amber water poured smoothly with gentle thunder over the russet rocks and the pool itself was almost still and shiningly saffron . Crimson and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The little rills and brooks which flowed from the pool quivered in bright copper over the land . The sky above was a deep purple still , pierced by shafts of bronzelike spears in the east , and beyond the very mountains appeared like lion-colored and writhing heaps of stone , pathed with the first thin snows . Saul carried a basket of scarlet pomegranates in his hand for Dacyl , and the scent of them , mingled with the scent , rich and fruity , from the land , excited him strangely , and he felt his heart rise with promise and unknown excitement and it made him hurry along the empty and twisting road to the cataract and the pool . Once there , he surveyed it all with delight . His heart was still pacing rapidly , and he smiled exuberantly and a rejoicing in life filled him . The Psalms of adoration seemed too puny to him to express the rapture he felt , and the nameless anticipation . He looked about for Dacyl , but she was not there . Then , suddenly , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite side of the pond and the yellow creature had escaped his first notice for he blended so completely with the other natural tints plf  | about him . It was known that jackals carried rabies with them , and inflicted " the incurable wound " mentioned by Hippocrates , and Saul had watched a favorite young servant die , some years ago , choking with agony after the bite of a jackal . Jackals were sly but cowardly creatures . Unless mad , they did not attack human beings . But once mad they were like tigers . Saul 's first impulse was to run , to find Dacyl and to keep her from approaching the pond if she were on the way . Then he was again affrighted . The jackal had seen him . Instead of slinking away , as was the nature of jackals , the animal 's legs stiffened , his fur bristled and his evil head appeared to engorge . His wild eyes glowed in the first light and from his throat there issued a terrible snarling . So , the creature was afflicted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bloody foam along the jackal 's jaw . Stricken with terror , Saul could not look away . He dared not flee for fear of pursuit . Holding the animal with his eyes he slowly bent and lifted a heavy and jagged stone in his hand . Then he shouted menacingly . The jackal retreated a pace or two , but his snarling was like the grinding of rocks and then he uttered a howl of madness and shook from head to foot . But he retreated no more . It was then that Dacyl appeared , laughing , calling to Saul because she had heard his shout and she had believed that he was summoning her in impatience . There she stood , only a few paces from the jackal and on the mossy bank of the pool , looking across the water at Saul and smiling gaily , and waving . Sweat rushed out upon Saul 's flesh , and he was dumb . Then as Dacyl continued her waving and was beginning to seem a trifle perplexed , Saul found his voice . " Go into the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! Do not hesitate ! There is a jackal near you and he is mad ! " The girl turned her head and saw the beast . He had begun to crouch for the charge upon her , and she faintly screamed and fell back . " Swim ! " shouted Saul , almost beside himself . " To me ! Now ! " Dacyl flung herself into the water , not removing the cloak she wore against the cool morning wind . Her clothing restrained her strokes ; she twisted and turned in the water too slowly , and Saul dropped the basket of pomegranates and stepped into the water , himself . He had a confused thought that as rabies brought about a fear and dread of water the jackal would turn away . But Saul was hardly a few feet from the bank when the animal hurled himself into the pool in pursuit of Dacyl . Now he was howling and choking in a frenzy and the horrid sounds echoed in the morning silence .  | Saul clenched the jagged stone in his fist and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enraged beast , and the yellow head was like a mat of wool above the water . Saul kicked off his sandals and tore off his cloak and summoned all his strength to intercept the jackal and save Dacyl from a fatal bite . The water was chill and paralyzing , for the year was late . Saul saw Dacyl 's desperate white face above the water , and the long black floating of her hair and the entangling cloak and her threshing arms . She was whimpering and straining in her flight , and her eyes implored him for rescue . Now he was between the jackal and the girl . " Swim faster ! " he shouted , resolutely facing the tormented animal . " Reach the bank ! " He had heard that the power of the human eye was feared by beasts and he fixed his eyes on the jackal and did not look again at Dacyl , whose gasping he heard behind him . The jackal , however , had apparently not known that he was to fear the human eye , or he was too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snarling , and now his attention was fixed solely on Saul . The pool foamed about his struggling legs . Saul clearly saw the rabid glare in the jackal 's eyes and for a moment or two he felt renewed and shaking terror , for his own life was at stake . His legs appeared to have a life of their own , urging him to flee and save himself . But he could not abandon Dacyl ; the thought did not even occur to him . His heart was one lump of straining fire in his chest . The jackal hesitated . Saul was swimming between him and his first pursuit , and so was nearer . He half lifted himself in the water , howling , and launched himself at the youth . And at that instant Saul 's strong legs came down and encountered a rock in the water , on which he stood , and his whole sturdy body tightened itself for the attack and fear left him . His mind moved with amazing speed and order . He waited until the jackal was almost upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snapping . Then he reached out swiftly , caught the animal by the throat with his left hand and struck him fiercely on the very top of the head with the jagged stone he still held . The sharp point sank between the wild eyes , deeply , and a hideous shriek of pain burst from the afflicted creature . He fought to release himself , as blood welled about the daggerlike point of stone . Saul shuddered with loathing at the sight and feel of him . But he clung to the matted throat , tore out the stone and this time he plunged it directly into the right eye of the beast , turning and thrusting it with incredible strength . He felt it reach the soft and fevered brain , and now he clenched his teeth with renewed resolution ,  | withdrew the stone again and drove it into the animal 's throat , just above phis own hand , and again he turned and thrust with all the power he could produce . The water about him was stained with deadly scarlet in an instant , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool , and Saul was bloodied . Saul felt the dying animal relax and become limp , but again he thrust the stone into the left eye , using his last strength . The jackal sank below the surface of the water , slowly , in scarlet ripples , and died , its legs and body flaccid and drifting . Saul , watching that sinking , shuddered again . He had never killed anything before . He could hear his own breath in the stillness , raucous and groaning . He retreated from the spot where the animal had died , and he began to wash his arms and hands with clear water , for fear of the gouts of blood on them and the lethal saliva and any fleck of foam which might have been ejected onto his flesh . Then he thought of Dacyl . He turned and began to swim to the bank . The slave girl had collapsed upon the warming earth in a huddle of wet clothing , her face stark and still as she watched Saul 's approach . She could not move . Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him , as gray as death , her black eyes great in her face . Saul said , " The beast is dead . The pool is poisoned . Poor Dacyl . It is all over . You must not be afraid now . " Dacyl reached up dumbly for his hand and he took it and tried to warm it between his own cold and pouring hands . She was trying to speak . He bent tenderly to hear her . " Hercules , " she said , and smiled dimly . " Perseus . Odysseus . " Saul drew her quaking body to its feet and attempted to laugh . " It was nothing , " he said . " Could I abandon you ? " He put his soldier 's arms about her body , holding it tightly against him in a sudden frenzy of joy and love . " Do I not love you , my dear one ? " Water streamed from them , but their relief and their love warmed them , and the sun began to strike hotly on their bodies . Dacyl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her wet black hair , as soft as silk , fell over his bared arm . At the touch of her lips Saul trembled again , and desire struck him like a knife . When the girl raised her head he sought her lips , not gently and pleasantly as during the months before , but with ardor and lust and passion . They were sweet against his , and moist and cool . They parted in surrender , and she wound her arms about his neck and pressed her body against his , murmuring he knew not what . He could feel her young breast against his chest , urgent and straining and taut . Instinctively he reached for her breast and held  | one in the cup of his immediately hot and exploring hand , and she murmured again , languidly , clinging to him . He had never touched a woman 's breast before , and the feel of it in his hand drove him almost out of his mind . Together , still clinging , they fell on the warm bank among the tall and dusty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passion and incoherent sound and heat and delicious struggle . Above them the cataract sang and the sun brightened and golden dust floated in the air , and there was a wild sweet roaring in the youth 's ears . Saul was totally lost . He obeyed the instincts of his flesh , and was caught up in inexplicable and overpowering sensation , agonizingly sweet yet terrible in its urgent intensity . He lay upon Dacyl and took her savagely , and she held him to her and gently bit his throat and moaned with delight and pleasure . Their bodies were as hot as flame , and like flame they merged together , and all about them was the scent of agitated grasses and flowers , and the singing of the water . Entwined , they were conscious of nothing but ecstasy . Saul felt the moving of Dacyl 's flesh under him , and each movement intensified his sensations and he could not know if they were pain or bliss . He felt her tongue licking his ear tenderly , and heard her moaning breath and felt her quickening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that he had died in one explosion of rapture and that it was a death not to be rued for it was greater than life , like the bursting of a sun or a raining of stars . His eyes were closed . Sweating and gasping , he lay upon the girl and it was some moments before he rolled from her body and lay beside her , overwhelmed with what he had experienced . He had no immediate thoughts . He had only memory of something of immense and incredible joy and transport , beyond which was nothing comparable . Dacyl raised herself upon one elbow and looked down at him , smiling , her lips bright red and swollen , her drying hair warm on her naked shoulders and breast . He felt her movement and sluggishly opened his eyes , and he saw her face bent over him and it was more beautiful than he had ever known . Slowly he lifted his hand and touched her cheek , and she turned that cheek and kissed the palm of his hand . He heard a deep chuckling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One bare pale leg lay over one of his . Then , like a cold fist hitting his heart he thought , " I have ruined and deflowered and raped and ravaged this innocent child , and I am accursed . "  | " What is wrong , beloved ? " asked Dacyl , alarmed at the pallor and . rigidity of the face below hers . He turned his head aside . He wanted to weep with despair and regret and shame that he had taken this pure one and had defiled her , and that she had submitted to his lust out of gratitude and because she was only a slave and so could not deny an urgent man . Truly , he was anathema in the sight of God and men , and how could he atone for his sin and his crime ? Who could forgive him ? He deserved an ignominious death . Dacyl began to stroke the strong red crest of his hair , and his throat . " You are a veritable hero , beloved , " she said in her childish voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slave , adorable one . Not even Venus had so puissant a protector and lover , strong beyond the strength of other men . How she must envy me , the pearl of Cyprus ! " she kissed his cheek tenderly . Above her head the sky had turned a flaming blue and the golden cataract gushed in liquid music and the pool was again the color of young lemons . The grass and moss were soft beneath them , and languor held them . But Saul suffered in his soul profoundly . He said , " Forgive me , my dear one , forgive me if it is possible . " Dacyl 's lustrous black eyes widened with astonishment above him . She bent to see him more clearly , as if incredulous that he had said these words . The metallic blue of his strange eyes were suffused with tears , and Dacyl was amazed . " Forgive you ! " she exclaimed . " It is you who should forgive me for placing you in jeopardy with my carelessness ! Forgive you ! I adore you , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and muscles like armor ! If life holds nothing more for me than this morning , still I am grateful to all the gods that they permitted me to lie with you and comfort you and reward you . " Saul tried to smile at this innocent childishness . He stroked the soft side of her throat with a gentle hand . " But I ravaged you , dear one . I took advantage of your distraught state . I have deflowered you , and who can restore your purity ? " Dacyl sat upright , and abruptly . She stared down at him in wonderment . Then after a long moment she began to smile , and it was a woman 's humorous smile and not a girl 's . " Is that what troubles you , my foolish one ? " she said with soothing affection . " Go to ! I am seventeen years old , and am not a virgin . Surely , you did not believe me one ! " She laughed with rich tenderness . " I have not been a virgin since I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overseer of my master 's estate at that age , and we are to be married . I am pledged to him by my mistress , the noble Fabiola , and we will then be given our freedom and an olive grove , and we will be content ! But I will love you always , even when I see you no more . " Stunned and stricken and dumb , Saul listened to that light and happy voice , and finally he understood . He had been thinking as a Jew , but this girl was a heathen and had been born and reared in an atmosphere alien to his knowledge , alien to his comprehension . To her , no sin had been committed . She had garnered pleasure as one chooses a bauble , for an hour 's gratification , and then forgotten , discarded . She lived and had her being in a hedonist society where everything was permitted , honor scorned , desecration a matter for laughter , adultery a moment 's mere satisfaction , fornication accepted , and lasciviousness a thing to be cultivated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by pious Jews , execrated by them , avoided by them , and she was no longer Dacyl , the innocent slave girl over whom he had wept in secret , but the " strange woman " whose lips were the portals to hell . Into the pit of her body he , Saul ben Hillel , had incontinently and precipitously fallen , and he was lost . He was dirtied and corrupted beyond redemption . He was forsaken beyond hope , except that he devote his whole life to penance and remorse and repentance . God had averted His Face from him , and how could he atone in one short lifetime ? He had lain with a harlot . " What is it ? " asked Dacyl , in consternation . She had sought to comfort and ease him . She had given herself to him in delight and love and gratitude , and he had given her the gift of enormous pleasure as she had also given it to him . Yet he lay on the grass below her with a face of bitter iron and despair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his silence and his awful withdrawal . She watched him shake out his wet and wrinkled tunic . Why did he not speak , or smile ? Why did he avoid her eyes ? How had she offended him ? Of what grossness was she guilty ? Alarmed and beseeching , she touched his knee with her hand , but he started away from her as from the touch of vileness and horror . He sprang to his feet . He looked about him wildly . Tears fell from his eyes . Then , without speaking , he fled from her and was soon lost among the trees and the puzzled and frightened girl was alone , aimlessly and distractedly pondering in her mind this peculiar behavior of one she loved and had in some way mortally offended . She saw the basket of pomegranates which he had brought her . She  | began to eat one and the red juice trickled down her chin . Then she laughed softly and shrugged and shook her head . Men were not to be understood by women . One day he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and naked body , and was pleased . Saul never returned to that lovely spot and never thought of it again without aversion and loathing and shame . It haunted his life . Worse still , he acquired a disgust for women which remained with him . All female flesh , thereafter , was tainted by the scent of Dacyl in warm autumn grass , and the arms of women were the arms of pale serpents , unless they were virgins or honorable wives . Even then , they were suspect and always to be feared . Hillel ben Borush visited Aristo in the freedman 's small but comfortable quarters . " What ails my son , Aristo ? " the anxious father asked . " He is silent and pallid and brooding . He loves you . Has he not confided in you , that we may help him ? " Aristo knew his pupil far better than did the youth 's parents or Reb Isaac . He suspected that in some unknown spot , at some unknown hour , the rigid young Pharisee had encountered a woman and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so amusing Aristo would have felt concern . He knew that Saul no longer crept away in silence too early in the morning for his school . So , it was a woman . Aristo sighed . These Jews ! They regarded human pleasure with suspicion and avoided it . What a grim Deity was theirs ! Aristo thanked the gods , in whom he did not believe , that such a Deity had kept His afflictions of mind and soul to Himself and His special and circumscribed votaries . " What is it you suspect , Aristo ? " asked the troubled father , who had a very keen eye . " I voice no suspicions , lord , " said Aristo with respect . " For I have none . But perhaps our Saul is coming into manhood and is disturbed by his longings and unnamed desires . " Hillel blushed , and Aristo was freshly amused . " Saul is not ready for marriage , " said Hillel . Aristo could not help saying , " Get him , then , some compliant slave girl . " Hillel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , even slaves or servants . " Aristo chortled , but with respect . " That is not in accord with your teachings , of which Saul has informed me . Did not your David , the king , lust for Bathsheba , and order the murder of her husband so that  | he could possess her ? And I have read the Song of Songs , and surely Solombn was not addressing those Songs to his wives , who were possibly very decorous and uninteresting matrons ! " He smiled at Hillel . " I have always thought your hero , Joseph , a fool , or a eunuch , for refusing Potiphar 's wife . Dear Master . You Jews are very rigid , and do not enjoy life . Surely your God is not a Pharisee ! " Hillel could not help smiling . " Reb Isaac thinks so , though I do not . " Aristo said , " Remember your own youth , lord , for you are a handsome man and doubtless inspired glances from maidens . It is your own counsel . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a disease from which we do not recover , but by which we are mortally infected . I will keep my counsel , as you advise , Aristo . I will not question Saul . Questions are invariably insulting , from fathers . " He paused . " It is very strange that those we beget and love are alien to us , and are understood only by others . Is that God 's reminder that we do not possess our children and that we give them their flesh only , and that we must never claim them but must always let them go ? Their souls belong to God , and not to us . It is sad to be a father . " One day Aristo said to his silent and stony pupil : " I do not know what it is that torments you , Saul , but nothing is disastrous , eternally , in this world . Nothing is fixed in time . We must learn , at last , to forgive ourselves . " Saul said , with sudden and startling fierceness , " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Aristo smiled faintly . " Assuredly . The betrayal of trusting friends . Dishonor where dishonor was not deserved . Malice . Returning love with hatred . Crimes against the innocent and helpless . Stupidity . Lack of tolerance . The rejection of permitted pleasure . Gloom , where there is sunshine . Abstinence , when wine is offered . Arrogance without a reason to be arrogant . Hypocrisy . Sniveling guile . Cruelty without provocation . Lies . Desertions . Malevolence . Deceit . Fasting when feasting is at hand . Denial of life and joy . Covering of the face when dancing is encountered . A harsh voice amid music . The presentation of evil when given good . Of which of these , Saul of Tarshish , are you guilty ? " " Of none , " said Saul , whose bright color had faded recently . " Then , of nothing dire are you guilty , " said Aristo . But he thought , " Of some of these are you guilty , my poor pupil , but you do not know your guilt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gloomy Deity eventually forgive you , though I doubt other gods will . "  | Then he laughed to himself . " It is very probable that you do not understand your God , at all , and only malign Him ! " Tim family of Hillel ben Borush had intended to leave for Jerusalem , and the marriage of Sephorah after Hanukkah , the Feast of Lights , which coincided this year with the Roman Saturnalia and the celebrations of various other gods . Tarsus was very festive and never appeared to sleep in these days , and torches flared all night in their sockets on the walls and the streets resounded with music and cymbals and drums and flutes and laughter and running feet and the cries of women and the warning shouts of guards who were also drunk . A ship from Greece came into the port of Tarsus , a small merchant vessel loaded with resinous wine which the Greeks of the city preferred to all other wines . But it did not unload though it lay at anchor for several days . Then on the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sea and the Roman centurions looked after it in the pallid dawn light and cursed it , and shook their fists at it , and prayed silently . Their captain warned them not to speak of this to any other , and the soldiers , feeling for the sacred medals strung about their necks on chains , saluted and fell into line and marched away , iron soles clanging on the polished black stones of the street . But though the vessel had been guarded after doctors had examined several of the crew , and all doors had been bolted and galleys locked , the damage had been done . Several rats had swum ashore in the night and they carried with them their sickness and the fleas who had caused it . They died before morning in the gutters . The fleas found other hosts among the healthy rats of the city . There were two sanitaria in Tarsus . Three weeks later the Greek and Egyptian physicians knew the dreadful truth : Plague was abroad in the city . They consulted together . Should the people be told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly carrying the infection with them ? Should the gates be closed and guarded so that none could leave and no man enter the city ? In any event , the people would panic , and would mill mindlessly , attempt to escape , fight with the guards who tried to restrain them , and eventually , they would lose their minds and loot and burn and kill and commit many other crimes . The doctors  | decided that they would control matters as long as possible and tell no one . Winter was upon the land and the air was sharp and clear and cold , and the fields and gardens were brown and the sun was large and pale . The grape-colored mountains blazed with snow and the river ran in dull silver through the rich valley and Tarsus smelled of baking bread and roasting meats and wine in the marketplaces and the taverns and inns . It was not for some time that it was observed that no ships put into the usually turbulent port but stood out at sea and loaded boats that came to them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silks and cottons , wines , beer , whiskeys , oil , spices , salt and other merchandise . No reason was given even when it was observed that no ships of Tarsus put out to sea . Questions were asked when expected visitors did not arrive . One by one public buildings were quietly closed . Then because there were now too many questions and too many rumors the yellow flag was hoisted over the high Roman guard-tower above the harbor , and the people were stricken with terror , and the guards walked the streets all night with naked swords in their hands . Tarsus was by nature riotous and passionate , and for a few days the Romans were strained to their very limits of exhaustion and determination to keep the mindless mobs from too much vandalism and rioting . 1 error had the people by the throat . Doors and windows were closed tightly ; the streets began to be deserted except for thieves and the gatherers of the dead and the rattling of the death carts over the stones . A putrid stench rose from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clean them and to wash down the streets , even at the threat of imprisonment and death , so the Roman soldiers turned to this task . No one jeered . Fright was too great . The wagons did not come into the city in the mornings but waited outside the gates and there left their wares and fled . Only hunger forced men to the gathering and the distribution . And everyone drank mightily and burned incense to the gods , but no one came to the temples . The weather grew colder . The house of Hillel ben Borush was heated with constantly fed braziers and woolen curtains , thick and heavy , had been drawn over the windows to keep out the chill winds , and doors were barred . Deborah , for all her vanity and lightness of mind , was a sensible matron when it concerned her household , and the storehouses were full . The family was fitted to endure a siege , and all knew , now , that they were indeed besieged by something more fearful than a human foe . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets . Avid and terrified eyes peered from behind curtains at the fu-  | nerals of the mean and the mighty , but of few Jews . So evil rumors began to spread . It had long been believed that the Jews were acquainted with magic they would share with no others and had sorceries against illness which they kept from their neighbors so only they would survive . But the physicians in the teeming sanitaria knew that it was the Jews ' insistence on absolute cleanliness and their intolerance of vermin which gave them some measure of protection against disease , even against the plague . They became alarmed at the rumors they heard and warned the Roman centurions . The Romans , the most tolerant of conquerors , the most lawabiding , the strongest despisers of tales and passions and disorders , prepared to protect the Jews if necessary , and issued warnings of their own . Those caught looting property would abide by the ancient law : Looters were to be executed immediately . Those guilty of setting fires would be thrown into their own fires , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a street , even in the harsh and brilliant sunlight of the day , which did not have its patrolling soldiers in war dress . The sun glinted on their swords , and on dropped visors and on armored chests . The resolute steps of the soldiers resounded from stone and the voices of their officers were loud in the silent city . The banners of Rome fluttered against the hard blue sky and the carriers of fasces were everywhere , demonstrating to the people that law was law above all else , and there would be no lawlessness in Tarsus so long as any Roman remained alive . Hillel heard of these things but did not inform his household . He had no visitors and he was thankful that he lived in the suburbs . The walls and floors of his house were washed down at dawn by his servants , each and every morning , and rats and mice hunted mercilessly . All stayed within the house except for necessary excursions into the garden for last fruits and dates and citrons , and to the storehouses . Fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the suburbs and the city , but with the fear was mingled prayers . But the infection spread . Just when the first pale pink blossoms were appearing on the almond trees in the garden and bare twigs were quickening and myrtle was budding , Deborah and her son , Saul , were stricken by the plague . As the household was small and not pretentious it did not possess a family physician in residence , and physicians were always available from the sanitaria or from their private practices . Hillel , for the first time in his life , mounted a horse and rode into Tarsus . He would not permit the family carriage to be used , for he would then endanger a slave or a servant who would be driving it , and he feared a chariot . The horse was the least of his anxiety though  | lay was accustomed to riding an ass when he rode at all , a docile and patient ass and not like this horse which , though gelded , moved too rapidly for its master . The Roman soldiers laughed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sanitaria and asked for his friend , the famed Egyptian physician , Aramis . While he waited in the cold marble hall he could hear the screams and groans of the dying in their wards , and he wrapped his cloak tightly about him , closed his eyes and prayed the prayer for departing souls . Then Aramis was beside him , touching his arm , and he dropped the hood of his cloak and his eyes were full of tears . The Egyptian was very tall and dark and lean with a thin and prominent Hebraic face . " Dear friend , " he said , and he was full of concern . " Do not tell me that your family is stricken ! " Hillel nodded . He could not speak for a moment or two , and then he said , " My wife , Deborah bas Shebua , and my only son , Saul . You know them well . " " I will come at once , " said Aramis , and he went for his pouch and l lillel tried to control his despair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hooded in gray wool , carrying his pouch . His horse , a line Arabian steed , was waiting for him at the gate . " I can not thank you enough , " Hillel stammered , as he struggled to rise onto his own horse . He was not adroit ; he began to fall over the side of the animal and desperately clutched at its mane , and Aramis ' servant caught him and gravely replaced him . Hillel was hardly aware of this ; his haggard face was desolate . He stared at the physician , mounted high and proud . " Save them , " said Hillel . " Save them , and all that I have is yours . " They rode through the empty streets , Hillel tossing on his horse and hardly able to control it . Finally Aramis took the reins from his hands and led the horse . He said , " Do not despair . The plague is waning and those we now see have it in a milder form . Many survive . Before the summer comes the disease will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deborah in her carved ebony and ivory bed he knew she was moribund . She had the plague in its worst form , in her lungs , and her blood dripped from her lips and she was not conscious . Aramis regarded her with sadness and pity : So beautiful a young woman , and so doomed . He could do nothing for her but relieve her last agony , and so he prepared a potion brewed of opium for her and told her servants to give spoonfuls of it to her when she could swallow . Then he threw aside the darkening wool curtains and let the wind and sun into the room so that at the last Deborah could see the sky and be  | comforted , and not die in dimness and seclusion . He bent over her and again touched her fiery cheek and she opened dulled and unaware blue eyes , already glazed with death . Aramis returned to Hillel , who awaited him in the atrium . The husband and father had been pacing in extreme agitation . He sprang at the physician when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the physician 's face , what there was to see , and he let his hands and head fall and did not speak . Aramis visited young Saul , who was delirious and tossing wildly on his bed , held there by the strength of two men servants . He had the bubonic form which , though desperate , held more hope than his mother 's affliction . His buboes were leaking pus and blood and the white linen sheets were stained . But Aramis reflected that the youth was strong and sturdy and of a vital constitution and had never been ill before . He had a possibility of survival . Aramis gave his orders to the servants , and two potions in flasks , and ordered cooling baths scented with verbena . He returned to Hillel and tried to smile . " Pray , " he said . " I have hope for Saul , for youth and life are with him . " " My wife , my sweetest one , my child , " said Hillel , and began to weep . He pulled his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips , asking for mercy . Aramis remained in the household of his friend until sunset , when Deborah bas Shebua , the child in spirit , the infant in true knowledge , died with one soft and final cry . Aramis put his arm in support about the shoulders of Hillel ben Borush , who watched a servant gently close the eyes of his wife and fold her hands on her breast , and then cover her face with the sheet . Hillel began to tremble violently . He pulled his shawl over his head and cried aloud : " ' The Lord gives . The Lord has taken away . Blessed be the Name of the Lord ! " His voice broke and his shoulders bent , but he recited in a low and steadfast voice the Psalm of David : " Out of the depths have I called You , 0 Lord ! Lord , hearken to my voice . Let Your ears be attentive to the voice of my supplications . If You , Lord , should mark iniquities , 0 Lord , who could stand ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared . I wait for the Lord ; my soul does wait ,  | And in His Word do I hope . My soul waits for the Lord , More than watchmen for the morning , Yea , more than watchmen for the morning . 0 Israel , hope in the Lord ! For with the Lord there is mercy , And with Him is plenteous redemption ? " He paused and clasped his white hands together and said in a louder voice : " Hear , 0 Israel ! The Lord our God , the Lord is One ! " Then he could stand no more but fell on his face beside the bed of his wife . Aramis shook his head in compassionate wonder . He could not understand why a man , so deeply stricken by the loss of a beloved , could recall his God and adore Him , and cry aloud to his people to remember I I is Name . But then , he reflected , the Jews were an incredible people , Iis his own people had reason to remember . None could comprehend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before His blows , offended the Egyptian 's sense of civilization and pride , and manliness . His mother had been in her tomb for a number of days before Saul awoke to consciousness , weakness and pain and drenching cold sweat . He awoke to the sight of Aramis ' face , bent over him in the morning light , and the feel of his palm on his forehead . " Saul ? " said the physician gently . " Do you know me , Saul ? " The first red rays of the sun were striking on the gleaming white walls of the cubiculum , and a warm sweet wind of early spring blew out the curtains over the windows . Saul 's cracked and parched lips moved in a faint whisper , and Aramis smiled contentedly . The boy would live . He ordered a cool draught for him , half wine , half water , mixed with raw eggs , and held it , himself , to Saul 's mouth and bade him drink . The youth obeyed , looking fixedly at the Egyptian 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it were like stone over which gray skin had been stretched . The flesh was gone . Only the red hair had vitality now . The strenuous blue eyes were remote , as If remembering a far place and time . The youth whispered , " I thought I had died . " " Not yet , " said Aramis , pleased that Saul had swallowed all the  | ' draught . " You have defeated death , as you will defeat him again and again . " The neck of his tunic had fallen forward and Saul saw what hung about his throat on a golden chain , and even in his weakness and prostration he was startled . For the object was as long as his middle finger and made of gold , and it was a cross with a looped top which held to the chain . Saul felt a dim astonishment at the sight of this infamous object , this symbol of a shameful Roman death , of criminal execution . He could not take his eyes from it and Aramis , seeing this , touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of man 's redemption , given to my people from the ages , the sign of the resurrection of the dead , " he said . " From everlasting to everlasting . " A curious thrill ran through Saul 's weakened flesh but what had caused it he did not know . Yet he thought that he had discerned a flash somewhere like lightning , like the tearing of a fabric which had concealed a blazing lamp . He was still pondering on this strangeness , pain and confusion mixed with a sense of premonition , when he fell asleep , and it was a sleep undisturbed by the nightmares which had haunted him and had driven his feeble soul into dark caverns of terror . When his father visited him at sunset he had vague memories of seeing his face bending like this over him many times during his almost mortal illness . But now he saw clearly . Hillel had aged ; the brightness of his hair and beard had paled ; his face was thin and filled with suffering , and his brown eyes were scored by many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the day after his mother . He stared at his father , and he knew . Pain took him , pain of the spirit , not for Deborah but for Hillel whom he deeply loved . He sought his father 's hand weakly , and Hillel 's fingers closed over his . Hillel bowed his head , and he repeated : " The Lord gives . The Lord takes away . Blessed be the Name of the Lord . " Saul began to weep , silently , and again his grief was for his father . Hillel wiped away his tears . " I have my children , " he said . " God is good , blessed be His Name . " A servant lit a lamp on the table nearby and its yellow tongue fluttered in the evening wind . Saul turned his head to look at the last light and it seemed to him that he was no longer a youth but a man . His hand tightened over his father 's . His heart expanded painfully with love for this tenderest of fathers , but Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he did not know why he should feel so and why he desired , above all things , to protect Hillel.  | It was many weeks before Saul recovered even a measure of his strength . Never again was he to feel the bodily power of the years before his illness , and the tirelessness of it . From that time henceforth he was driven less by his youth and vital energy , now much depleted , than by the strength of his spirit . He was to know weakness of the flesh and weariness to the day he died , and no more did his soul bound in him like a newborn lamb in the morning of life . He had returned from a far place and had left much behind him , never to be regained . During the weeks of his recovery he sometimes thought of his mother , but as the days passed he found it hard to recall the beauty of her face and the sound of her voice . This grieved him . He felt himself an unnatural son that he could not mourn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his lack of sorrow , and forgot that his mother had not loved him . When he stood with his father , saying Kaddish , he hated himself for what he believed was his arrant hypocrisy . He wanted to beg his father 's forgiveness for lack of sensibility and hardness of heart . But he could not increase Hillel 's suffering , and so he recited the prayers for the dead with him . He despised himself because he could not truly believe that his mother 's soul had survived her light and trivial existence in this world ; she had died as a flower dies , sinking crumpled into the earth , the petals decaying . Women , he would think , were not worthy of the grief of a man , nor his pain . He thought this even when before her tomb , watching his father lay a sheaf of summer flowers upon it . When he thought of Dacyl involuntarily he would shiver as at an intrusion of evil , and would pray to be delivered from her memory . He considered his sister , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less Indulgent with her airiness and mockery and often found her laughter displeasing . When she cried for her mother he was impatient and restless . He desired something with a great desiring and a mighty and starving hunger , but what it was that he desired in place of what he had lost he did not know . Chapter 6 Tiiouon it was the custom for a bridegroom to come to her father 's house for the bride , Hillel had long ago decided that when his daughter married it would be under the light of Jerusalem , the city of her  | feathers and of her people , the city of Sion , the holy place of God and the Temple . It was autumn again before Hillel ben Borush took Sephorah and Saul to Israel and to Jerusalem , and Hillel wept afresh that his beloved wife was not on this journey to take joy in her daughter but must remain behind in her tomb . He had taken Deborah from her father 's house , and never had she seen it again , and he reproached himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Deborah would not see her daughter 's wedding garments and her jewels and the gifts the bridegroom , Deborah 's nephew , Ezekiel , had sent Sephorah . He would stroke the girl 's shining hair , so like his own and gaze tenderly into her golden eyes , and he would sigh . Yesterday she had been but a babe . Now she was fifteen years old , and a woman . Tomorrow , she would be a mother , herself . Hillel endured the weight of time and sorrow on his shoulders and he felt old and exhausted . They sailed from Tarsus on such a warm and golden autumn day that Saul was assaulted by emotions he could hardly control . Two unfathomable forces contended in him , both furious and contentious and denying , and he dared not examine them . He stood on the deck of the galleon and watched the fervid harbor recede and the multicolored city , as furious , noisy and busy as ever , and the traffic on the river with red and blue and green and white sails , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plains and the valley . The sun was passionate on the scene , giving it life and vitality and fervent movement , and the water was like yellow oil . Now the city became a medley of every color known to man , and the tiled roofs shimmered as if with fire , and the galleon carefully picked her way through massed ships in the harbor and her sails filled with hot wind and stood like the great white wings of birds against the ardent blue of the sky . Saul could smell warm resin and tar and hemp and heated wood and salt and the deck dipped and rose beneath his feet . It was strange to him . He had never left Tarsus before , and he tried to fix his mind on the novelty and perceive it . But the emotions that tore him like two fanged tigers would not let him go . His father and Sephorah reclined under an awning on the deck and listlessly ate fruit , feeling sadness that Deborah was not with them , and nearby sat Sephorah 's two maidens who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve her . But Hillel , the simple man , had no servant with him . There was gray mingled in his golden hair and beard , for he was now nearly forty-seven , and sorrow had taken the brilliance from his eyes and had dimmed his flesh . But he smiled at his  | daughter and sighed . A maiden needed her mother at this time of her his , to counsel her and advise her and admonish her . But Sephorah had no mother . The family of Hillel ben Borush were to be guests in the house of David ben Shebua , and David 's wife was a Roman matron who had been described to Hillel as " an old Roman , " and not a licentious and worldly woman of modern society . She was so virtuous woman , and of so distinguished and ancient a Roman house , that she was also extremely pious and had instilled in her sons and daughters not only the principles and precepts of the old stern gods but had insisted on their being given a rigid training in their father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modest and retiring as she had been in her girlhood , and were trained to Jewish duties and reverence  --  as an " old " Roman Clodia was courteous to her husband and her husband 's family , for all she was of the gens Cornelius . Her sons had been circumcised ; they meticulously observed the Jewish holidays because of their mother 's severe insistence though they smiled at her behind her strong square back . However , Clodia was respected and more than a little feared , and of this Hillel had heard and had few doubts but that Clodia would impart to Sephorah the secrets and the exhortations necessary for a bride . Hillel had been informed by other relatives that Clodia resembled a stalwart peasant woman from the fields of the Campagna rather than a great Roman lady , whose kinsmen were honored by , rather than honoring , the new Caesar , Tiberius Claudius Nero , in that monstrous and distant city of Rome . Her father and her brothers had served in his campaigns and had been famous for valor , and her family arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of David ben Shebua 's house in Jerusalem . " My wife , " David ben Shebua had written , somewhat ruefully , " can at times be considered handsome , though never beautiful . She is frugal and stern , but kind and just , and would have made an excellent wife for one of the old patriarchs . She guards my purse , which I find a little onerous , but I know of her excellent investments and her large properties . Reserved and quiet though my Clodia is , rarely speaking in the presence of men , I have heard that in Rome she is the terror of bankers and stockbrokers . Her accounts would awe a moneylender , so correct are they . She visits the Court of the Gentiles on the Holy Days as %edulously as she visits and sacrifices to her favorite divinity , Juno of the harsh temper and the everseeing eyes  --  doubtless she considers me another Jupiter ! Her domestic gifts are superb . My table is valued by I lerod , himself , the Tetrarch , not to mention my Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admire her exotic cooks .  | Clodia is no provincial . You will notice I speak of Clodia 's cooks , not mine , for she considers her domain sacred and not to be invaded by husbands . We have a cook of Greek talent , an Egyptian cook who prepares dishes to make a Syrian envious , and , most certainly , a Jewish cook . To the amusement of many , my Clodia obeys the dietary laws of the Jews ! " Hillel had always been a little incredulous about this , discovering it hard to imagine a great and noble Roman lady governing her kitchen in a strange land among strangers not of her race and religion , and deferring dutifully to what she considered to be her husband 's duty , and managing her household not as a Roman but as a lady of Israel . But then , he would reflect , the Romans resemble us Jews very mysteriously . He had also heard that Clodia regarded Greeks , and Sadducees , with a disapproving eye which , Hillel would think with a smile , must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the jests of his family and his friends . But Hillel recalled the words of Ruth : " Thy people shall be my people , and thy God my God . " Clodia had probably never heard of Ruth but she exemplified her . Clodia , therefore , was a redoubtable lady and , while the family of Shebua ben Abraham affected to find her amusing and rallied David on his wife , they respected and feared her . Even her father-in-law , the aging and urbane Shebua , deferred to her and the wives of David 's brothers were timid before this righteous and determined matron . Deborah , who had first seen Clodia when she , Deborah , had been a child , had often declared that the Roman lady was " gross and with a heavy hand , more fitted to the field than to a cultivated house , and resembled a servant . " So Hillel was heartened . He thought that he would find Clodia very similar to his dead and beloved grandmother , Sarah . But he wondered with some uneasiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother , could accustom herself to rarely appearing before men , never dining with them , and secluding herself in the women 's quarters , over which Clodia was the rigorous queen . He had tried to tell the girl of her aunt , and Sephorah , who had heard much from her mother , was laughingly dismayed . " A veritable Gorgon , " she had said . " Let us speak of a mother of Israel , " Hillel had replied . Father and daughter had then looked at each other and had laughed a little . It was Saul who had listened with approval of Clodia , and in some way Hillel had felt this a deprecation of Deborah . Yet Hillel was relieved . In many ways Saul was more the son of a Clodia than of a  | Deborah and even , perhaps , of a Hillel ben Borush . During the past year he had become even more so . Hillel now watched Saul who was leaning on the rail of the ship and looking back at Tarsus , become , in the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water , surmounted by those terrible mountains . The youth 's chin was already faintly red with his growing beard ; his crest of red hair appeared still virile and arrogant , and his ears were cnormous . His profile was set and unrelenting with his thoughts , the big nose arching from his face , his chin hard and fixed , his mouth a straight and somber line . His former high color had left him ; he seemed less sturdy , but taller and thinner . Yet his indomitable air had strangely increased with his decline of physical vitality , and if his body was more slender his shoulders appeared wider and more manly . His legs were still deplorable , but lately he had given up the short tunic and wore a robe to his ankles , a brown linen robe with a girdle of dull worked silver , covered by a cloak of the same unpleasant color . But for his remarkable face he would have seemed to be a son of a somewhat unprosperous merchant , simple and plain and unpretentious , bent on securing as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship . He would hardly impress his aristocratic kinsmen in Jerusalem though doubtless Clodia would admire him . There had never been much communication between Hillel and his son , though Hillel had helplessly struggled to draw closer to Saul from his childhood . He knew that Saul loved him ; he also knew that Saul did not place much value on his mind and did not approve of his rare , but telling and amusing , jests about the more fanatic of the Pharisees . Saul , Hillel was afraid , was really indulging his father when Ile listened with silent respect to his homilies and little parables and his cxi ) lanations of some obscure paragraph in the Scriptures . Saul , Hillel was sadly sure , had already reached a more subtle and learned conclusion which was possibly correct and not diffused , as in Hillel 's fashion . In short , Saul was the complete and unbending Pharisee and Hillel unjustly blamed Reb Isaac for this and accused himself of not being tolerant and emphatic enough in his own teaching of his son . Hillel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Saul , except for an occasional ironic comment or some sardonic remark , and these had become more marked and frequent during the past year . The portents of his infanthood were manifesting themselves inexorably . The old occasional tenderness , the old young impulsiveness , the old artless loud laughter of boyhood , had left Saul a year ago , not slowly , not through illness , but in a moment . He could still speak vociferously  | and dogmatically , but no longer did his smile offer half an apology or amusement at himself . When Saul spoke now he did not invite argument or disagreement , not even from his father . Only Aristo could make him flush when disputing with him , but now anger would light up those peculiar and compelling eyes . Surely Saul did not think himself infallible ! No , thought Hillel , still watching his son , he does not believe himself infallible , but he thinks himself superior to other men in judgment and understanding of the Word of God and the precepts of the prophets and the patriarchs : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthless , in defense of the Holy One of Israel , the guardian of the Book . He talked of the Messias on every occasion , dismissing all other conversation as irrelevant and time-destroying , and therefore sinful and debasing . Sometimes Hillel felt weary . Hillel , therefore , was anticipating Jerusalem , with its Romans and Greeks and many other races , its teeming cosmopolitan civilization , its many diversities and faces and manners and customs , with a relief he would have believed incredible only a year ago . Saul would be an anachronism in that lively and colorful society , and Hillel was not displeased . He felt a little guilty when he hoped that in some way Saul would not encounter numerous other Pharisees  --  but it was possible that even Pharisees in Jerusalem had mellowed a little . Saul was young , and the young were susceptible , and Hillel hoped that one day soon the younger Saul would return , eager with life , ready with a jest , boisterous with young laughter , teasing his sister , curious and tireless . Saul lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and faced his father and sister . " Come join us for wine and fruit , my son , " Hillel said , and made room for Saul on the couch on which he sat . The ship creaked and heeled , and other passengers conversed loudly and there was tramping below and runnings up and down the stairs , and the mighty sails seemed to be attempting to lift the ship into the sky . A group of young Roman legionnaires stood at a distance , drinking , exchanging rollicking and obscene jests and swaggering where they stood and clanking their iron-shod feet , and furtively eying the beautiful Sephorah . Saul saw this and he suddenly gave the soldiers a fierce and despising look . They were astonished ; they were only lads and they had been admiring a delectable young lady who had not shown any displeasure . Their mouths fell open . They were insulted by this plainly clad and insignificant youth , with the flaring red hair . They clanged their feet harder on the wooden deck . One or two even touched their swords and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ masters of  | the world . How dared a miserable man from Tarsus resent their conversation or their laughter and favor them with a look which consigned them to the status of the market rabble , or slaves ? Then Saul turned from them and went to his father and sister . Sephorah was half reclining on the soft divan , very conscious of the glances she had evoked from those boys . She wore a chiton of blue silk artfully embroidered in gold and silver and her smooth white arms were bare , as was her throat , and her veil was like a mist over her golden hair , and there were jewels at her neck and on her arms and hands and her feet were shod with scarlet slippers . Her golden eyes glistened and her lips were like wet rubies and her pretty nose was warm ivory and she had assumed an air of worldly languor . Perfume rose from her and Saul was suddenly reminded of the scent of crushed flowers and grass on which he and Dacyl had lain . Torment seized him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said through his teeth . " There Is kohl about your eyes and a paint-pot on your mouth . Your arms are naked and shameless , and your ankles are exposed . ' Where is your modesty , your decorum ? " Never before had he spoken in such a tone and in such words to his once-beloved Sephorah . The girl paled and shrank . The Roman soldiers listened , even more astonished . Then Hillel sat upright and for the first time Saul saw his father deeply angered against him , and outraged . The brown eyes became hard and daunting . " Saul , " said Hillel . " Depart from us until you have prepared an apology . We will dine alone . " He still stared harshly at his son . " It is said that he who insults another in public , without provocation , incurs the wrath of God . Meditate on that , while you eat your solitary meal . " For the first time in his life Saul did not bow before his father 's rebuke . Instead he gazed at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and formidable eyes that Hillel was horrified and stricken . It was a stranger who confronted him and not his son , and the stranger was not of his spirit . Then Saul inclined his head , turned on his heel and left his father . I le went down the stairs to the room he shared with Hillel . Hillel watched him go and the sorrow became desolate in his eyes . " Father , " said Sephorah , seeing this . " Saul is guiltless of offense . He spoke from some misery in his soul . I have discerned this for over a year . His illness devastated him . " Hillel touched her soft little hand . He said , No . The change appeared before his illness , before your mother 's death , may God rest  | her soul . He is possessed , but of what he is possessed I do not know , and I have no pathway to his mind and he bars the way . " He hesitated . He looked at the avid Roman soldiers who had listened . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fruit in compensation , but by this act he would confirm Saul 's unspeakable behavior in their opinion and be shamed by his own son . He sat for a little under the striped awning with his daughter , while she gently stroked his hand in sympathy , and the blinding light of water and sky dazzled their eyes . Finally he rose in silence and followed Saul , finding him in the small spare room they shared together and in which their chests had already been deposited . The sun glared through the little window . They could hear the chanting of the galley slaves below , a mournful and wordless sound . Hillel sat near his son , not speaking , and Saul sat on the edge of his narrow couch , his hands dropped between his knees , his head bent , his red hair disordered . Hillel could see nothing of his face but a clenched cheek , unusually pale , and the jutting of his pugnacious brow . At last Hillel spoke . " Your insult to your sister , whom you once loved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between his teeth , " I spoke out of my conscience . " To this Hillel said , " It is remarked in Deuteronomy that that man is accursed who elevates his conscience above the divine laws of God . He is a heathen . He will have no place in the world hereafter . What crimes have been perpetrated in the name of the individual conscience , what calamities , what injustices , what errors ! A man can not trust his conscience unless it is in perfect accord with God 's commands , blessed be His Name , for , what is man ? A creature of dust and pride , of wanton and willful imaginings , of self-deceits , of vanity , of profound ignorance when he believes himself most wise , of illusion , of fantasy . You will recall that Moses was inspired to kill a man , and thus aroused the anger of God . Yet , what he did , of a certainty , was no doubt urged by his ' conscience . " Saul did not speak for a moment , then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , then , out of the teachings of my youth , that women must not disport nor array themselves as harlots and whores , as strange women , and that always they must be of a modest demeanor with bent eyes and a quiet tongue . " Hillel studied him . He said , more gently , " My son , it was not Sephorah 's raiment nor her manner which distresses you , for always was she so and I confess that I find it beautiful and innocent . If God had de-  | sired to make ugliness the mark of a good woman then He would have created no charming ones to delight the eyes of men and to array our lives with color and enchantment . Do not speak to me of temptations ! God tempts no man to evil . No , it was not Sephorah , your dear sister whom you once loved . It is something else that has tormented you for over a year . I am your father . Am I unworthy to hear a son 's confidence ? " Saul 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Hillel suffered for him . The bent head fell lower . " I can not tell you , my father , " said the youth in so stifled a voice that Hillel could hardly hear what he said . " It is beyond forgiveness . " For an instant only Hillel was greatly alarmed and his heart gave a painful throb of fear . Saul continued : " I have violated all the precepts and teachings of my youth , have mortally offended God , have destroyed my place in Israel . " Hillel could now control the panic he had felt . He said , " What holy Commandment did you violate , Saul ? " It seemed absurd to him , and he could even smile now , that his son , hardly sixteen years of age , a student fanatically devout , an obedient son , a lover of his home , an almost immured one , could have violated a Commandment or committed any other sin of any magnitude . He saw that Saul 's brow was wrinkled in concentration . He saw the side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought , " How disastrous are the thoughts of youth , of what awful and ridiculous exaggeration , and crashing thunders , and fatalities and doom ! " Saul said , " I can not confess to you , my father , for if I should I should die of shame , and never would you forgive me . " " You are my son , and I begot you , and what you have done , and will do , will be part of my own being , Saul . If you will not confess , if you will not let me console you , remember that God pardons always a repentant sinner . The only unpardonable sin is to presume that God will find nothing unpardonable . I doubt that you are a great sinner ; I doubt you have violated the Commandments . Keep your own counsel . But remember , always , that God will not despise a contrite heart . " When Saul did not answer or move , Hillel continued , " It is the way of youth to intensify , to throw itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to rejoice as a madman rejoices , to mourn et though the end of all being had arrived . I would not have you bee that it is my opinion that youth can not sin , and even most dreadfully . But it does take a certain amount of knowledge and experience b sin willfully and with the full consent of one 's soul , and to rejoice  | in the sinning , and to know it was sin from the first moment of temptation . Youth has not had these  --  advantages . " And Hillel smiled . Saul said , and his voice was the voice of a stranger , " My father , you were always a tolerant man and not always did you adhere to the teachings of the Pharisees , and often jested at a point you considered too rigorous . " It is useless , thought Hillel . He rose , but he did not know where he should go . He was now too distressed . He only knew he must leave his son . I have lost him , he thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and I must face this finally . " He said , " You are committing a mortal sin . You defy God to forgive you . " It was then that Saul seized the red hair of his temples in an agony and pulled his head down upon his knees . Seeing this , Hillel felt deep anguish of his own , and he pondered , his unseen hand outstretched to his son . It was not God entirely , then , which so tortured his son , nor even a misapprehension of God . This was a human guilt that beset him , a human woe . Saul was using his God as a Scapegoat , as the Receiver of his torture . When a man cried , " God will not forgive me ! " he often meant " I can not forgive myself ! " So Hillel said , " All pain passes , all loss , my son . " His voice was deep and compassionate . " I thought I should die when your mother died , but it was not God 's will , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . I longed for the sight of her face , her voice , the rustle of her garments . When I considered that no longer would I see her , no longer caress her , and that she was lost to me , I almost lost my mind . My sorrow is still almost beyond my capacity to bear . But we were born to be men , and not weak beasts , who lie in the dust and tamely give up their lives when it becomes unendurable . What tears your heart has torn the hearts of multitudes before you , and will tear them again , age after age . But hearken to this : You are young . You will survive . Your wound will heal . It will leave a scar , but it will heal . " It was as if Saul had not heard him , so Hillel slowly went from the cabin and returned to his daughter . Saul lifted his head . He said aloud , " It will not heal . No , it will never heal . " He began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in passion of spirit , in longing and in loathing , in yearning and in self-disgust . Hillel said to his daughter , Sephorah , who was much concerned about his sad face and mournful eyes , " I fear it is as Aristo has said ? and I dared to laugh in my ignorance when he said it ! ? that two giants struggle in the soul of my son : The normal young lust for life and joy  | In living and rejoicing in each morn , and an iron certainty that these are evil and must be smothered and murdered in order that all a man 's thoughts should be centered on God . Saul , then , deprives himself of his youth and his natural young gaiety and the wonder and the beauty and the grandeur of creation , and his expectation of tomorrow and Its gifts , considering these worthless and a snare for his soul . He would shroud God in crepuscular clouds and terrible lightnings and make of Him , not a loving Father , merciful and full of lovingkindness , but n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest sin or error in order to punish it most cruelly , and delighting not in His children but regarding them as an oppressive king regards his people , suspecting them of crimes and rebellions , and preparing for them the most hideous flagellations and death . Surely , " said Hillel , as the full enormity of the thought developed in him , " that is a sin which God , blessed be His Name , must find it hard to forgive ! " He added , " In one of the Psalms David says , When they said , let us , go into the House of the Lord , I was glad . ' But Saul goes to the House of God like a chained criminal , desirous , aye desirous , not only to worship but to be chastised . What secret sin he has committed does not deserve so fearful a fate , my poor son . " Saul leaned on the rail of the ship and saw the great port of Joppa rising out of the blood-red sea and standing against a sky as scarlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers , the holy land , the sacred soil of the prophets , the mountain filled with fire on which God had thundered , the home of the patriarchs , the cradle of the Messias to come , the matrix in which the Messianic Age would be formed , the little land from which would speak the Voice which would reconcile the nations and bring eternal peace to the world . There rose the blessed Mount of Sion , and the golden Temple and all the wisdom which would enlighten mankind and lift the darkness in which it lay , groveling like a beast . The thin silver thread of the new moon lifted itself over the sea and into the direful sky , and one single star , burning large and gold , stood in the zenith . Now Saul could smell the earth , acrid and spicy send lustful , as the galleon swung toward the harbor . This was an hour be had dreamed of all his life , and he had anticipated his joy and excitement . But he felt no joy , but only an anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil , a corrupt man , except to atone , to pray that one day he might be forgiven . Ile knew that among the many passengers also watching the ap-1  | proach of Joppa stood his father and his sister , Sephorah . He knew his ? father suffered for him ; he knew he had given his father sorrow , and it was an awful pain in him . But how worse a pain , perhaps , if his father guessed the truth ! Sometimes a small thought twisted in him that his father might not be so pained , might consider his sin small and trivial and easily forgiven , and might plead his youth and the natural temptations of youth . Perversely , for that very reason Saul could not confide in Hillel . Worse than the thought of his father 's possible pain was the thought that the sin might not pain him at all ! He preferred to believe in Hillel 's condemnation . As for Sephorah , Saul 's love for his sister was a misery in his heart , but he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . If she were not restrained now in her wanton behavior , were not taught the precepts of the mothers of Israel , then she was doomed in body and in soul . Better it would be for her to die before she had been corrupted , as he had been corrupted . A virgin death was better than a harlot 's life . Yet there was an intangible sickness in Saul 's thoughts , as he contemplated his sister and he dared not explore the reason . She would marry Ezekiel ben David and be subject to his mother , Clodia , rumored to be a just and rigorous and virtuous woman . She would be immured from all the voluptuousness of this present evil world , and all its vices and clamors , its pollutions and its destructions . Saul sought relief in the thought , and when it did not come he was dismayed . Hillel and Sephorah were not avoiding Saul ; it was he who was avoiding them . In fact , they had begun to converse amiably with other passengers and the centurion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it possible for them to be amiable to the enslavers of their country and their people , the despoilers and blasphemers of their land ? Saul had never loved Romans . Now he despised and hated them . He glanced sideways along the deck , full of gloom . The vast heavens , the vast sea behind and about them , still glowed as if in flames , but the ship 's deck was dark , the figures on it dark also . The white sails were lashed with scarlet . Joppa rocked nearer over the burning water and Saul now saw that the famous harbor was full of ships , small and large , a forest of denuded masts like the bare branches of winter trees . A hot breath blew from the heated land , resinous , perfumed , somewhat putrid , peppery , dusty , reeking of crowded streets and humanity . Plangent sound came over the water , voices , roars , shouts , hard loud laughter , a sudden ruffle of drums . Now twinkling lights of lanterns appeared on the docks and the crimson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its hugeness , the banner of Rome , its red color almost  | host against the red sky , but Saul knew what was on it : " S.P.Q.R. ? Scnatus Populusque Romanus  --  The Senate and People of Rome . " Blasphemous , incongruous , shameful , frightful ! thought Saul ben I Iillel , and he beat his fists heavily on the rail of the ship . He could have wept in his anger and hatred and outrage . Someone touched his arm . Hillel said , " We are coming into the harbor . Calm yourself , my son . " Hillel 's face was pale and shadowy in the light of the celestial conflagration . " It is not to be borne , " said Saul through his teeth . " What must be borne must be borne , " said Hillel , and returned to Sephorah and her maidens . But the Messias , blessed be His Name , would drive the Romans into the sea as the Egyptians had been drowned , and Rome , that boastful monster of a city , that dragon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dripping with the blood of the conquered , would die in one flash of avenging lightning . The galleon was swaying between the crowded ranks of other ships and vessels in the harbor and the crew were ready with ropes and anchors and there was much running on the deck and excited voices from the passengers , and eager laughter . The sailors darted among heaps of chests and coffers and pouches belonging to the passengers , and their hoarse and impatient cries were like the voices of foxes . Vultures , black as death and as silent , were wheeling and circling against the redness of the sky . The galleon docked . Beyond the wharfs was the tumultuous city of Joppa , full of lights and torches , clamorous . All at once darkness fell on the earth , the ominous color was gone except for one long ember on the western horizon in which the last scarlet circle of the sun still burned , a dying eye . Amid the flickering of the lanterns and torches on the docks stood the ubiquitous Roman soldiers , helmeted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs spread , their faces apparently indifferent , their breasts armored in thick leather . Behind them seethed and fluttered welcoming relatives of the passengers , and behind them was a crowd of chariots and cars and horses and workers waiting to unload the vessel and big wagons and asses and yoked oxen . The shifting light of torches splashed them redly , illuminating a face here and there then plunging it into darkness , catching a waving hand then losing it . The noise , to Saul , was overwhelming , the heat unexpected for all it was autumn . " We have a long journey to Jerusalem , " said Hillel , coming to his son again . " We will stay the night in an inn . It is possible that some of our kinsmen may be greeting us . I hoped we could have landed at  | Caesarea , but there was no ship leaving Tarsus for another three weeks and I wished to spend the High Holy Days with my people . " He thought of Deborah with melancholy . The soldiers would not permit friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility of foundering it , but their captain made way for a group to embark and Hillel said with happy astonishment , " David ben Shebua , and his brother , Simon , and that is surely the young Ezekiel , bridegroom of our Sephorah , and Joseph ben Shebua also , and , no ! It is ! My dear cousin Hannah 's husband , Aulus , the centurion ! " Hillel 's eyes were suddenly filled with tears . His cousin , Hannah , and her family and her husband , were his only living kinsmen for his had been a family of few children and he was the last child of his dead parents . It was Aulus , himself , the centurion , who was , with calm and stately Roman gestures , ushering the kinsmen upon the ship and all the passengers stared to see who was so honored and so conducted , and the captain made his way to greet the Roman officer . Saul looked at him with contempt , in the light of the lanterns now lit on the galleon . Aulus was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a jovial and bearded face under his helmet , big white teeth , a huge nose and kind strong brown eyes . He was the first to embrace Hillel , seizing him in his bared arms and kissing his cheek . He smelled of sweat and hearty food and garlic and leather . " My dear Aulus , " said Hillel , much moved . " Shalom . " " Shalom , " said Aulus . He struck Hillel an affectionate blow on the shoulder . " I have come to conduct you to Jerusalem . " Then the family of Deborah was upon them , the elegant David scented and urbane , clad in fine wool and silk of purple and gold , the less elegant older brother , Simon , but a man evidently well-dined and prosperous and exceedingly plump and jeweled and arrayed in blue and silver with an Alexandrine dagger in his girdle , and Joseph ben Shebua , his twin brother and almost a replica , but less sleek . All , of course , wore no beards and all had their sister Deborah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with auburn lashes , and their uncovered heads showed their tawny hair carefully arranged , curled and perfumed in the Greek manner . However , in spite of their jewels and gold and garments Simon and Joseph exuded a certain complacent grossness , an oiled polish , which offended Saul who waited while his father was lovingly greeted . The youth Ezekiel , but little older than Saul , himself , stood apart in shy respect and deference , and Saul saw that he was thin and somewhat small and insignificant and dark  | d very Latin in appearance . He had his mother 's Roman nose , her definite and prominent profile , but his eyes were the eyes of his father , avid , lake-blue and shining . His clothing was not as elaborate and ch as his father 's . He wore a long tunic of white linen bordered with Id embroidery , and a brown cowled cloak , and there was but one sing on his finger and no gemmed bracelets clasping his arms such as clasped the arms of his father and uncles . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kinsmen , as Aulus , the Roman , had cried . They embraced Hillel calmly and greeted him and Made him welcome . They regarded Saul with some curiosity , and Were polite , and David thought that the youth had not improved in appearance but indeed had lost that bright color which had once given him an appearance of exuberance . Hillel answered them as gravely and f irmally . He was somewhat disturbed that the young Ezekiel was with his father , David . It was unseemly . A bridegroom did not look upon his bride until the day they were espoused , but the family of Shebua evidently thought that anachronistic and old-fashioned and unworthy of Sadducees who were civilized and cosmopolitan . Ezekiel was David 's youngest son , and not handsome , but he had his mother 's virtues and was very intelligent , so David had forgiven him his lack of comeliness. it was unfortunate , and a little amusing , that the Roman mother had made the youth into a reasonable image of a Pharisee and had sternly urged upon him his Jewish duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with bitterness and disdain . They arc Hellenistic heathens . He saw Aulus grinning at him amiably and turned away . He looked at his sister ; she had , to his surprise and approval , dropped her veil over her face so that her features could be teen but mistily and her maidens were grouped about her discreetly . But her uncle , David , lifted the veil aside and in the mingled lantern and torchlight all saw her virgin beauty and Ezekiel , her bridegroom , turned crimson with shyness and admiration . The uncles kissed the girl 's cheek and listened to her whisper of greeting , and were proud of her . " She is as lovely as our lost Deborah , " said David , and he thought of the girl 's rich dowry . But , after a glance at Hillel , he did not bring forward his son . Servants of the house of Shebua carried the chests and coffers of the travelers to ornate and lavish cars , beside which waited the chariot of Aulus and the horses of his legionnaires . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night , as lustrous as silk , and their harness was silver and their hoofs gleamed as if shod with silver also . Saul found himself in the car of his uncle , Simon ben Shebua , and  | Ezekiel , and he sat down grimly on yellow silk cushions . The other occupants were two men , servants , who were to do the driving , and they were arrayed in fine linen and were cloaked and helmeted as soldiers , to Saul 's fresh scorn . Now they moved off the docks , the crowds staring , the Roman legionnaires riding about them ; a few men made mocking sounds , some of them ribald . Ahead galloped Aulus and Saul was infuriated to see the banner of Rome unfurled by the soldier who rode at his side . When Ezekiel timidly asked him a question about his journey he affected not to hear him , but wrapped himself in his dull brown cloak and pulled his hood over his head . Simon saw this and thought that the son of Hillel ben Borush resembled a peasant in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with narrow streets paved with rounded black stones which glistened in the new frail moonlight and the glare of fluttering torches , and crowded . The bazaars were still open . Saul could hear the angry voices of merchants or their wheedling tones , and he saw women with dark faces and with baskets heaped with fruit on their heads , and oxen and asses , and he could smell the vehement odors of the city . He saw Roman guard-towers and Roman soldiers and the banners of Rome , and he saw faces he recognized as Greek and Syrian and Arabian and other motley races , churning about in the bazaars or hastening through the streets , their voices hoarse , their language incomprehensible . Walls rose and disappeared ; there was a scent of hidden gardens , of pine and fountains and manure and roasting meats . Camels turned corners and their riders glowered at the rich entourage that was sweeping to meet them . Once or twice there was a burst of music and women 's laughter and songs from behind walls , or the crying of children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saul found nothing , in this pungent and sweetly fetid air , spicy and hot , of the city of his birth . But , it was his land , his country , he told himself . He was a Roman citizen , but he was a Jew above all . This land was flesh of his flesh , blood of his blood , however alien it appeared to him in Joppa . He saw family groups on the flat roofs of some of the houses , which were pale brown in color with narrow windows , and climbed steeply . The gutters were noisome and rank and evil water ran between stones , and Saul detected a sudden stench of urine and offal . The light wind had died ; the odor of salt was lost as they penetrated farther into the city toward the broad Roman road . They stayed the night in a quiet and comfortable inn , already pre-  | fared for them by the family of Shebua . But Saul lay awake and intense until dawn , his emotions not to be known even by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solitude of spirit . Chapter 7 THEY set out at sunrise for Jerusalem and saw the last of the sea , dark purple under a purple sky , the east , over the hills , turning lilac and geld . Hillel ben Borush rode for a pace in the rushing chariot of his friend and cousin , Aulus Platonius , his gray-gold beard flowing behind him , his hood partly covering his face , his cloak streaming in the cool morning wind . It was hardly a pleasure in which he cared to Indulge , and he stood beside Aulus and gripped the rail of the chariot , much to the amusement of the charioteer who sat on the one wooden scat in the pounding vehicle . It was evident that Hillel feared for his life and did not trust the four black Arabian geldings who tore into the air and the breeze as if still puissant . They foamed at the mouth and tossed their heads and flecks of foam snapped backwards and Hillel clung as if his life depended upon it . But he wished to talk to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the procession , and the standard of Rome clapped in the wind to Aulus ' right , and Aulus stood sturdily , leather wristlets protecting his wrists , a red cloak Oaring from his shoulders , his helmet firmly fixed on his round head , his beard lively and fluttering , and his short sturdy legs braced expertly as he drove . He loved activity , danger and rapid movement and no clash of stone against the iron-rimmed wheels of the chariot did more than sway him a little , whereas poor Hillel expected momentarily to he thrown to the road . Deborah 's brothers had always been a weariness to Hillel and the hours he had spent with them last night had been sufficient for him . God knew he would be forced to endure their company for a considerable time in Israel . He preferred this seemingly reckless charge into the morning  --  at least for a time  --  to riding with his kinsmen . " How goes it with you , dearest of friends ? " shouted Aulus over the uproar not only of his chariot but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hoofs . Hillel shouted back , " Not too happily . " Aulus sighed , thinking of the beautiful dead Deborah . He had seen her but three times in her short Lie and had thought her both entrancing and stupid , desirable traits I  | in a woman . His own Hannah was the noblest of women with a sweet round face like a plate and a soft voice which assumed no contradiction , and a temperament which would not have permitted it . The earth began to lighten as the hills lost their darkness and became of a pale copper and saffron color . Aulus glanced at his friend 's face and saw his sadness . Hillel 's profile was brooding and melancholy as he sought out landmarks which he had almost forgotten in his years in Tarsus . Hillel said , " What do you think of my son , Saul , my only son , whom you have never seen before , Aulus ? " " I saw him but fleetingly , " said the Roman . It was not like this forthright soldier to be evasive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " he said . " We were a time on the deck , awaiting our chests and baskets and coffers and pouches , and there were many lanterns and torches , and I saw you watching my son while you directed your men and the sailors and chattered with the captain . Do not be afraid of offending me , for there is no malice or cruelty in you , Aulus , but only truth and honor . " The Roman wiped the dust from his lips with the back of his hand and stared over the heads of his raging horses . " One does not need many words to describe a man . If you say a man is weak , or effeminate , or untruthful or cowardly or a libertine , you have drawn his portrait . Your son , Hillel , has power . " " Power ! " exclaimed Hillel , in wonder . " I have thought him strong and impatient and restless and determined and sometimes contentious , but I did not think of power . " " Power , " repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The power of an old ' Roman or perhaps of an old ' Jew . It is implicit in his eyes , in his glance , in his movements . He also possesses authority , which is only an attribute of power . I think of him as a soldier . To say a man has power is not always flattering , for he can use that essence of soul to the destruction of others . That , Saul will never do , and I say this to you truly . He is a young man of honor , like his father . " Hillel murmured his thanks , and dared to take one of his gripping hands from the rail to touch one of his friend 's . Aulus smiled at him , and now , in the growing light , Hillel could see the white shine of Aulus ' great white teeth through his bearded lips . Aulus was glad that Hillel did not question him further . He had not been pleased with Saul . The youth had been too removed , seemingly too indifferent to all about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that nothing stirred him . He was like one who lived in iron , or who was tormented of soul .  | " And how is our Milo ? " asked Hillel , referring to Aulus ' own son who was five years older than Saul . Aulus ' broad chest expanded with pride . He pushed his helmet back little from his brown forehead . He smiled happily . " In Rome at present , with the Praetorian Guard . It is a vast honor to be chosen for the personal protection of Caesar . He is a fine soldier , my Milo ! But he is of two warrior races , is he not ? " Hillel had almost forgotten that his people were indeed of an irascible and warlike breed , proud and stiffnecked , valorous and brave . The Sadducees were always vexing his thoughts and the Pharisees were too concerned with the minutest phrases of the Book , and raising an awful clamor at the slightest breech of a single paragraph of the Scriptures . When they were not expostulating and arguing they were writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little space to reflect on the prowess of other Jews and the intrepid history of Israel . In an absent tone Hillel asked , " How are our Zealots and Essenes ? " Aulus grinned with wryness . " They keep us occupied , " he said . " It is conducive to leanness in my men , for this climate , you must admit , is not so salubrious as Rome nor so mild , and the stony hills are endless and the caves countless . Your Zealots and Essenes still believe it is possible to defeat Rome and throw us into the sea . They must be admired for patriotism and dedication if not for extreme intelligence , and reason . " But Hillel could not smile at this . Those unfortunate and zealous young men , loving their God and their country above all else , and endlessly harassing the mighty Roman ! It was useless  --  but it was also noble . There were some who did not ignore the Romans as did the Pharisees nor fraternize with them and admire them , as did the Sadducees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heroic than not resisting . And had not God rescued the Israelites from Pharaoh and from the walls of Babylon when all seemed hopeless ? Who knew the future ? The dream of freedom never left the hearts of men . Now the sun , like a golden and conquering warrior , mounted the farthest somber hill and the earth was flooded with dazzling light . It was autumn , and the harvests were in and many of the fields on each tide of the road were yellow and smooth as a good cheese and sundarkened shepherds in rough robes and headcloths were moving through the last garnering with their sheep . Little villages flew past the entourage , pale saffron of brick and stucco  --  narrow small houses with slitlike windows and streets between them little more than stony  | slits themselves . Here and there walls appeared , careful yellowish stone laid neatly upon stone without mortar , crowded with climbing vines whose leaves were like blood . The sun was hot but the air was cool and flowing , and now the sea was lost to the left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes lined the road , then gave way to copses of climbing pines resinous and stimulating , then to silvery olive groves heavy with green or dark fruit , then to rows of yellow citrons or pomegranates bending under globes like polished fire . Gray boulders and high thistles clustered at the roadside , surrendering to meadows suddenly green and radiant in the morning light , and vineyards whose vines were thick with opalescent grapes . The approaching hills , and those distant on either hand , were gray or copper and worn as huge ancient stone . The Romans had denuded them of cypresses to build their ships , and though many were terraced like giant steps and carefully cultivated with vegetables and vineyards , they had a desolate look , blasted and hungry . They were less mountains than barriers between the crowding villages and towns of yellow or brown brick . Goats clambered on those hot terraces . Now bending palms cast a sharp shade , and rattled , and glistened with a dust as the entourage roared by . But little brooks and rivers shone and gamboled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exuberant and vital with the odors of stone , floating golden dust , fields , grapes , fruit , barley and wheat , hot green grass and resin . Farmers were abroad , with their sons , carrying baskets in which they placed bunches of sweet syrupy dates and figs and pomegranates and olives and citrons , and herds of cattle moved on the meadows and girls with geese ran across the road , laughing , their gay headcloths streaming in the brilliant air . There would be another crop to lay for wheat in the spring , and many farmers , blackcloaked , with white headcloths , were plowing , the patient asses going before , the dark earth turning and steaming . Once or twice , as the entourage raced by , an encroaching small hill gushed with blue or green water , and little children splashed in the pools below and goats came to drink , and fowl . Haystacks dotted the yellow land , and stacks of wheat and barley , and flat-roofed little farmhouses with white walls peeped shyly from groves of palms or sycamores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eddies in the drying grass . The landscape began to dance with the heat of the sun so that it hurt the eyes and there was a vast radiance everywhere . Everything swam in light . Hillel threw back his hood . He could not have enough of the seeing of his native land , and remembrance . The sky was so vivid  | with blue effulgence that it appeared to burn . Round tall Roman guard-towers threw shade and soldiers stood in it , young men with alert faces and searching eyes , their helmets glinting , their muscled legs polished . A few leaned against the towers and surreptitiously munched fruit , or went inside the cool interior for a refreshing drink of wine , while their officers , as young themselves , pretended not to notice . In and out of hot villages and towns , odorous and loud even so early as this with the merchants and stalls and the market rabble and women carrying baskets and children running and shouting and the donkeys braying and the curses of hurrying men and wagons and horses and camels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before the full blasting heat of the autumn day . The cool wind had died . Now everyone was choking on dust and wiping lips and huddling within hoods and dashing away sweat . " In Rome , " said Aulus , " there is a refreshing wind from the sea and ? coolness from the Campagna and a green breath from the Alban hills . " " Yes , " said Hillel , but he thought his country more vital than Rome and its suburbs for all it was a little land , and conquered . Strange it was that men and races came and went and there were clashes of arms and change and terror and slavery , but the land and those who worked and nurtured the land remained . There was a certain eternal serenity on the earth which none could disturb . It held the dead and the living and was equally indifferent to both . It had its own being . It was a gigantic tomb , for countless nations lay buried in the earth and their flesh and bones fed it , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Hillel was a youth , but he saw many more rich villas now near the road than he remembered , with high stone walls and glimpses of rainbowed gardens and fountains through iron gates . This depressed him . He wondered what his son and daughter were thinking of their country , which they had never seen before . He envied them . How glorious it was to view Israel for the first time , this ancient and holy land , this land of milk and honey , from which sprang the immortal moral laws of God and which still echoes with the Voice of Sinai , and from whose flesh the Messias would be born and cast the light of His eyes ! The Greeks had elaborated and cherished the glory of the mind , and philosophy , and beauty beyond imagining and reason and civilized behavior and Demos and the graceful gods , and songs , and had built radiant cities and had invented poesy and dialogue and perfect art , and the Romans had struck grandeur on the earth and had brought law above all to chaotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists beyond anything the world had ever known before , and had introduced sanitation and clean water to the remotest places , and were tolerant and just and powerful and handsome and sane , and had produced Ciceros and Catos and Virgils as well as Catilinas and Caesares , and measured representative government and order , and commerce and trade . But neither Greece nor Rome  --  nor even mystic Egypt nor India  --  had produced the Promise of the Ages , nor had they opened the portals of men 's souls to the Visage and the Law of God . Despite what the Pharisees declared , the Jews were not a people , not a race , in the full meaning of the terms . They were , at best , but the modern descendants of disparate nomadic tribes who came from no one knew where and whose destiny was still unknown but only conjectured by those who studied the Kabalah . Always they had been surrounded by the Semitic peoples : The Phoenicians , the Hittites , the Arabs , the Moabites , the Philistines , the Egyptians , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and always they had been strangers among them , fought , cursed , reviled , enslaved , driven forth , killed , destroyed , beaten and scattered . But always they had returned to their little country , blood-stained but unconquered , to raise again the Temple to their God and to shout , as Moses had triumphantly shouted , " Proclaim liberty throughout the Land , unto all the inhabitants thereof ! " Then it seemed to Hillel that a mysterious voice sounded in his spirit : " The Drama has just begun ! " His soul lifted in a strange exultation and his eyes brightened , and he knew not why , but he was filled with both a powerful sorrow and a powerful joy . He wished to communicate these things , but his tongue felt heavy and he had no words . Alas , alas , he thought , the deepest voice of the soul can not be uttered , except to God . An unprepossessing youth , thought luxurious and plump Simon ben Shebua as he closely observed his nephew from the shadow of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of face and abrupt of manner , and his mother , my sister , was all grace and prattle and sweetness and courtesy . Hillel ben Borush is pleasing of countenance and affable of manner . How was it possible for these to produce such a son ? Their daughter is charming . But this Saul resembles the less agreeable Romans . His father has written us of his intellect and the power of his mind . Yet he has the manners of a peasant . In comparison my brother David 's son , Ezekiel , is a paragon of beauty and graciousness and deportment , though I had heretofore felt him the least captivating of the sons of  | their father . But ah ! these Pharisees ! ( Simon had been one of the brothers who had opposed the marriage of his sister to Hillel ben Borush . He thought of his own sons with complacency . But his daughters , he reflected , were not so beautiful as Sephorah bas Hillel . However , one was already espoused to a Greek merchant , very rich and possessed of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountering him , as a possible husband for his daughter , Yochabel , the youngest and prettiest and only thirteen , and his favorite . Were it not for the wealth Saul would inherit Simon would have laughed at himself . ) Where Hillel had seen the eternal land  --  never withholding her gifts of water and fruit and grain and serenity  --  Saul had seen an afflicted country , forlorn and desolate . Where Hillel had observed the browned farmers faithfully plowing and seeding despite the Roman occupation ( being wiser than the men of the cities ) Saul had seen slaves and had wept in his heart for them , calling silently to them as brothers from his overwhelmed emotions . Hillel had heard birds and the wind , the laughter of children and women , the songs of the busy farmers , but Saul had heard only plaints and weeping and prayers for deliverance . Hillel had patience , and Saul 's spirit had never known that virtue . In short , where Hillel saw a certain tranquillity , a simple wisdom , and entrancing beauty , Saul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretching forth skeleton hands to the tardy Messias , pleading for rescue , invoking curses on the blasphemous Roman and longing not only to be free but to be purified . He saw the Roman soldiers . Near Caesarea as they had passed that white and licentious city he had seen the amphitheater on the outskirts where Roman brutality and unspeakable cruelty had their being In this ravished land . Here captured Zealots and Essenes had hung on crosses for their intransigence and patriotism and devotion to the Lord their God . Hillel had averted his eyes from the amphitheater and had softly murmured the prayers for the dead and the repose of their souls in the bosom of Abraham . Men , he had thought , were hard and unjust and malicious , for that was their animal nature . If they had no victims they invariably invented them . The reflection saddened Hillel though he had never enthusiastically hoped for nor truly believed in the alleged good that lay , like a pearl , in the slimy musculature of a bestial organism . Men were men , more alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , blessed be His Name , have mercy on them ! But Saul did not follow his father 's thoughts . The people of Israel were unique in virtue to all other peoples and nations . Hence , their  | martyrdom . He forgot that they were a warrior people and that the Scriptures had lauded their less attractive disposals of captives , no matter how helpless . Or , if he thought about it at all it was with the attending thought that God had been with their ensigns and their armies and the might of their swords . ( He had spoken of this to Aristo , who , after commenting that Israelites were remarkably like other conquerors , had expressed pity for the calumny against God , that He had allegedly blessed one army  --  as ferocious as the foe  --  and had shown no mercy for the helpless " enemy . " ) Once Hillel had told Saul , and only recently , that when the Red Sea had drowned Pharaoh 's soldiers and horsemen the angels had wished to voice their joy . But God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the sea , and you would sing ? " Hillel had admitted that the story was possibly only a parable , and had smiled at his son a little strangely , but Saul had been vexed . God had only one people , only one nation of sons , and all others were heathens and Gentiles . When Hillel had reminded him that it was prophesied that the Messias would be " a light unto the Gentiles " also , Saul had remained silent . Saul could not have enough of seeing the land of his fathers , but he did not see what Hillel saw . Therefore , his agony of spirit . The blue passion of the sky was lost to him , and the green and golden earth , the orchards , the groves , the streams , the trees and the vivacity of the market crowds in the ancient towns through which they rumbled . The one fascination lay for him in their names , the birthplaces of heroes and prophets and patriarchs . He longed to see David 's tomb , and the great tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only to be in Jerusalem , but in Bethlehem , where the Messias would be born . His sister , Sephorah , who was fascinating her kinsmen in David 's car , looked with lively interest on Israel and pondered on her shy bridegroom in the car ahead and sometimes peered at him with mischief if his eye caught hers . She had decided that he appeared kind and timid and would not be a difficult husband . Hence , she would have small trouble with him . She was a girl of much cleverness and enjoyed life and had shrewdness and wit , and possessed a naturalness of being which demanded little of others and was humorous with all , and content with her fate . If she was not a young female of intense emotions she was also incapable of hatred and gloom . She had affection for her father and had loved her mother , but above all she loved Saul and considered him afflicted , a matter time and kindness would mend . In the meantime , her wedding was approaching and it would be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the singing web of festivities and  | perhaps even he would learn to smile again and to laugh as he once had laughed , boisterously and with all his heart . The Roman road , as the entourage clattered thunderously in the sunset some hours later , climbed many steep hills and then dashed down into valleys strewn with little brown houses and gardens and narrow pastures and brooks and rills . Then Aulus pointed to the empurpling distance and said , " Jerusalem . " Hillel , who had bravely remained with him in the leaping chariot , turned his eyes in the direction of the far city and murmured , " If I forget thee , Jerusalem , may my hand lose its cunning , my eye its lustre and its sight , and my heart die in dust . " Aulus , who guessed his emotion , pretended to be giving all his attention to his horses . The Roman was a pious man who believed deeply in his old gods , and he revered piety in others . Nevertheless , he could not help but remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which were vociferously proffered and declared the one true faith and all the rest heresy . Still , he thought kindly , we Romans have adopted the Egyptian gods and have temples in Rome to Isis and Osiris and Serapis , among others , and give them honors and support them with taxes . We are tolerant of all , and therefore we do not understand the insistence of Jews , and it bewilders us . We prefer law and order , and universal peace . He was grateful for his Hannah , modest and sweet for all her indomitable will , who , while living implicitly as an " old " Jewess had tolerance for her husband 's belief . A remarkable matron , thought Aulus , longing for her comforting arms . He even permitted her to bore him with her repeated and patient explanations that there were , in truth , two main Jewish religions , one of prayer and synagogue , and one of the Temple , embracing sacrifice and ceremony and learning , one simple and without ostentation and the other of great ritual and incense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God was God , and this seemed sufficient . But the Jews were contentious and there was always alertness among the Romans for any incipient rebellion or riot or violence , for this was an abrasive people who never really submitted , and for that he secretly admired them . There was always at least one uproar in the surrounding provinces , alas , with resultant and ruthless carnage and executions on the cross , and flayings alive . There upon the highest hill stood Jerusalem , yellow-gray winding and slitted walls and battlemented guard-towers seemingly not built by man but only an outcropping of regimented stones on high bulwarks yellow-gold with autumn . Against the walls , and on the crumbling earthy bulwarks , stood lone groups of stiff black-green pointed cypresses and an occasional stand of tall and dusty palms . Torches  | were already aflare on the battlements and against the walls , and thus their grim and stony yellowness was imprinted upon the dark purple sky , and scarlet shadows fluttered over the stone and even fingered down on the bulwarks . In the spring and summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so forbidding , for the bulwarks are struck with ardent green and wild flowers . But he felt a deeper melancholy . As the Holy Days were approaching the goat's-hair tents of some pilgrims were already being cast on the bulwarks of the city , and the little red fires could be seen burning here and there , and the movement of lanterns . The city was always crowded later at this time of the year , every inn filled to bursting , and as the people from the provinces had neither the money for inns nor could find room , they were forced to bring their tents , their goats , even their geese and fowl and asses , and an occasional milch cow . This made for liveliness and noise a little later , as the people increased in numbers , but now their only occasional presence on the rising bulwarks enhanced the lonely and abandoned scene . Hillel thought of their long hot and dusty journeys here , with their domestic beasts and their wives and children , and tears came to his eyes . Devotion to God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Joppa and Caesarea . The entourage entered through the Joppa Gate but were not challenged by the Roman soldiers on guard because all recognized Aulus Platonius , and all saluted the standard of Rome in the vanguard . " Greetings , lads ! " called Aulus , as the gates were opened and he pulled up his chariot in the shadow of the arch . He spoke as if he had been absent for months and not for days . The officer in charge , a young man with a sun-darkened and wary face , saluted him and came to the chariot and said , " Greetings , noble Aulus Platonius . All is peaceful . " " That is remarkable , " said Aulus , and the officer grinned and looked curiously at the entourage . " My kinsmen , " said Aulus . " I have conducted them from Joppa . " If the officer felt some surprise that a Roman had so many Jewish kinsmen , who were apparently so very rich also , he did not reveal it . He looked with respect at the elaborate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his arm in salute again and the entourage swept into the city . The iron gates clanged after them . In the smaller towns and villages and little cities there had been a certain gaiety , raucousness and ease , even under the ubiquitous eyes of the Romans . The people went about their business , farming , selling , manufacturing and negotiating . Life went on , they appeared to say with a shrug of fatality . A man must live in spite of disaster . But Jeru-  | Salem , that great and resounding city , that center of Mid-East culture and trade and commerce and wealth , and filled with many races , had a certain indescribable somberness about it , a certain darkness and heaviness of spirit . Yet , here the Hellenistic arete glowed very conspicuously among the cosmopolitan Jewish Sadducees and there were many flourishing and active Greek colonies of merchants and traders and academicians and indolent wealthy residents , and there were many Roman soldiers with their wives and families living here , not to speak of Roman bankers and businessmen and bureaucrats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with handsome dowries . Here lived Syrians , Persians , Arabs and Phoenicians and others of the Semitic races , including Egyptians who taught in the academy of medicine or who were valued as cooks in the noblest of houses . If ever there was a heterogeneous city , as heterogeneous as Rome , herself , Jerusalem was that city . Therefore , the intangible darkness and heaviness which lay on the city seemed incomprehensible . Even spring exuberance and summer bloom could not lighten it , nor its multitudinous gardens , nor its fine public buildings , handsome villas , clean streets , banking and brokerage houses , and the markets and the rich mercantile establishments . A thousand different dialects and tongues could not lift its air of brooding and weighty contemplation , nor its wealth . Some said that it was because Jerusalem was so old and was bending under the history of the ages , and the devout Jews said Jerusalem mourned that she was now but a province of the Romans and could not endure Roman occupation . Hillel loved Jerusalem , but he recalled now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and subdued atmosphere of the city  --  and the Romans , then , were not so conspicuous as now . The more rigid of the Pharisees declared that God , in His Temple , had wrapped Himself in His cloak , and had covered His face , because of the Romans and the defections of His people . ( Apparently , said some of the more erudite Romans with wryness , He had no other affairs to supervise . ) God , said the Pharisees , had thrown His Face into shadow and withdrawal , until the day when His Messias would be born and the Jews delivered forever from slavery and oppression . In the meantime , before that day arrived , God was incommunicado except to His elect , namely the Pharisees . True it was that Jerusalem was profaned with Greek and Roman temples and theaters but Hillel doubted that this particularly enraged God . He had been wise enough , however , to keep this heretical opinion from his fellow Pharisees . But he often pondered on the gloomy air  | of Jerusalem . As she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a certain naughty sophistication about her , a certain lightheartedness . But this was not so . Even the Greeks and the Romans found her oppressive , and they often cast troubled eyes at the mighty golden Temple , with its golden dome and spires and its golden gates and vast gardens and courts . Some of them , in a spirit of conciliation and even fear , frequently went to the Court of the Gentiles within the purlieus of the Temple , and paid for sacrifices and bought amulets . It did not harm to please and placate Eastern gods , who were noted for capriciousness . They had heard that the God of the Jews lacked humor and was famed for ferocity and was a valiant Warrior , Himself , and had a distressing way of smiting suddenly , and so the superstitious Greeks and Romans hoped to disarm Him with their tolerance . Privately , they thought Him without beauty and grace and gaiety , all civilized attributes . The music they heard distantly in the Court of the Gentiles did nothing to lift their hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ominous things . They had never heard that David had urged his people to " make a glad noise unto the Lord , " for certainly the Temple in Jerusalem made the very reverse of " glad noises . " Nor could the Romans truly believe  --  if it had ever occurred to them  --  that God resented their presence anywhere , for were they not the people of the Law ? And was not the first command of the universe the command of order ? Without law and order there was only chaos , and even the Jewish God should appreciate that . Saul was nothing but eyes as he entered the holy city of his fathers , and he forgot the onerous and distasteful presence of his kinsmen and their jovial comments to each other . He even forgot his kinsman , the Roman Aulus , and the standard and fasces of Rome . He was but a seeing vessel and he sat stiffly in the car of Simon ben Shebua and watched everything , his heart seemingly enflamed and obviously throbbing . He could hardly breathe . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a thousand disturbing odors , and there was no breeze to lift the scent of latrines , foliage , stone , dry earth and the pervasive aromatic smell as of pepper and spice and iron , and cheese . And from every street came the clanging rattle and beat of chariots , horses and cars . As Jerusalem was a city on a hill it rose in terraces , one above the other , a city of marble and yellow stone , of domes and porticoes and spires , of neat and narrow cobbled roads , of alleys and cypresses and palms and tamarisk and karob trees , of Roman aqueducts , of marketplaces and twisting vistas , of gardens and villas and crowded tene-  | ments and of fountains . The earth was terra-cotta ; what paths could be teen were of gravel . Everywhere were walls of saffron stone , except for Roman and Greek houses which now affected the " open " appearance advocated among Roman architects . Jerusalem was mainly a heaped rising city of flat roofs , despite the domes and spires , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk for miles on those roofs without touching ground . It was on these that the multitudinous families gathered of an evening after the heat of the day . Some of the roofs bore earth , carried up in basket after basket , and here little palm trees had been planted , and flowers , and sometimes vegetables . Many had striped awnings for protection against the sun . Saul saw it all , in the spurring red glare of torches thrust into walls and the light of huge lanterns illuminating every street corner . He also saw the Roman patrols . He saw the crowds , emerging into what coolness might be expected after night advanced , and he heard cymbals and laughter and music and the dull roaring of any living city , magnified here . But , like Hillel , he also felt the brooding darkness and heaviness of the city though unlike Hillel he did not wonder why . He was certain he knew . He was also certain that here was the heart of Creation , the very center of God 's being , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would vanish through the ages and be known no more . He felt this with a passionate certitude and an avenging joy . Trtouca Shebua ben Abraham had built his awesome Greco-Roman house on one of Jerusalem 's more secluded and quiet streets , and though his children had been born there and his wife had been ostensible mistress , he adhered to the Roman fashion and referred to it as " the house of my son 's wife , Clodia Flavius . " For Shebua was now a widower , his meek wife having died just before the death of his daughter , Deborah . He had paid a literal fortune for that building of white marble and gleaming columns and colonnades and statues , and expansive gardens , the porticoes decorated with fine murals and friezes , the atrium a court in itself , and every room full of scented air like the fragrance of fern and fresh fountains . It was guarded by a wall of white stone and with gates of iron , standing in the midst of fig trees  | and karobs and sycamores and palms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scattered everywhere , and with red paths neatly bordered with square or rectangular or round beds of many-colored plants and blossoms . From its rise on the tiered city it had a view of the whole countryside and the lavender hills and the meadows and pastures and , in the distance , little crowded Bethlehem . It was a commanding house , a true " insula , " and was highly admired even by the languid and amused Greeks . Herod was often an esteemed visitor , and high Roman officials , for Shebua was known for his urbanity , his elegance , his learning and his delicacy both of mind and table and taste . The Pharisees abhorred him . He not only had a multitude of slaves but he never freed them , according to the Law . He had two concubines in fine quarters , and not even the dark cold disapproval of Clodia could force him to dismiss them . One was an Arabian beauty of serpentine charm , the other a delicious Nubian . " After all , " he would say , " was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the moon ? " The Pharisees not only disagreed that the Queen of Sheba was " black as night " but they despised Shebua as a renegade from his religion and his race , and hated him as a Sadducee and therefore an oppressor of his people . All the members of the great court , the Sanhedrin , were his friends , and he observed , humorously , two or three of the solemn Holy Days , but he believed in nothing , and especially not in the stern God of his Fathers , nor in the coming of the Messias . He was a gentleman , an epicure , an exquisite , and in his soul  --  he believed  --  a true Greek . He had visited Athens scores of times and his true allegiance , he would often say , was to the Parthenon where beauty soared in stone and Phidias walked at midnight , and Socrates strolled amid the columns . He loved to go to the theaters in Athens and in Jerusalem , where he helped to pay for the presentations of the more glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patron of actors and gladiators and athletes . His discrimination was superb , and even he often marveled at it gently . He was also deeply fond of the Romans , though he was inclined  --  when among Greek friends  --  to laugh at them softly and agree that they felt inferior to the Greeks in the matter of art and taste and nuances of thought . But he would waggle a translucent finger at his Greek visitors and say , " However , do not call them a nation of grocers , my friends ! They are far more than that ! Consider what they have done with the arch and all their other works of science , and the law and order they have brought to the world under the Pax Romana . These are no mean accomplishments . " He had the reputation of being  | a very cosmopolitan man indeed . Like Plato , whom he quoted frequently , he " found no message in fields and trees . " He had many farms , many investments , many accounts in the banks and the stock market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Once Clodia had asked him with a sour smile why he did not live in Greece , which he adored , and he had answered her as if she were a child ( though he feared her Roman soul ) , " My dear daughter , I owe it to my people to help in their enlightenment and to wean them from the contemplation of their God and to reverse their refusal to join the world , and to make them part of Humanity are all human beings , but we are not one in the manner of which you speak , Shebua . " Shebua affectionately insisted , though he did not like the cold eye Clodia had fixed on him , nor her narrowed mouth , " There is no longer room in this world for insular and provincial attitudes , nor nationalistic fervors , my dear . Men are part of me , and I am part of all other men . " " So it would seem , unfortunately , " said Clodia , whom Shebua deeply disliked . He persisted , with indulgence . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before a universal government , my daughter , the government of the world under one standard , under one ruler . That Is the dream of ages . It was the dream of Plato . " Then Clodia astonished him . He had not thought her very erudite . She said , " I remember what Aristotle said : I love Plato , but I love truth more . ' Plato was a fool . He never knew mankind . His Republic was not a noble dream . It was a dream of the cruel elite and the slavery of humanity . Hence , living men will always refute him , for men in their hearts love freedom . " In spite of his sweet smile of tender derision Shebua suddenly remembered the shout of Moses : " Proclaim liberty throughout the land , unto the inhabitants thereof ! " Then he immediately thought , " If Plato was a fool , as this poor woman has said , then Moses was mad . Liberty ? for all men . Absurd . " But among friends he seriously upheld the ideal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him was a theory , an abstraction , a poetic Idea , and had nothing to do with the masses he saw in the various cities he visited . They smelled , and Shebua ben Abraham disliked smells . He scented himself , Clodia would think , like a male whore . All his reflections were as remote from reality as his financial affairs were as strongly rooted in reality . He thought of himself as a poet , serene , tranquil , judicious , discreet and polished .  | He had had no influence with his sons , except for David , and his daughter had reverenced him . The plump and sleek Simon thought His father foolish ; Joseph , the hard merchant , considered him not quite intelligent . It was only David who admired and emulated him . All his sons were Sadducees , certainly , like himself . But they thought his dissertations , except for David , shallow and irrelevant . However , they held his money in the most pious regard and admitted among themselves that Shebua could make ten shekels grow where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And sometimes , when he gazed at them thoughtfully they became afraid of him though they did not know why . Despite his smiles and ease and manners and elegances and air of tolerance , they occasionally suspected him of implacable ruthlessness , and in this they were quite correct . This was the man who greeted the entourage from Joppa with magnanimity , reserved affection , and solicitude , meeting them in the atrium which was lighted with many Alexandrine and Egyptian lamps , all filled with aromatic oil , some scented with jasmine and roses . He wore a white toga in the Roman fashion , his tunic underneath belted with a gold girdle , jeweled armlets on his arms , many glittering rings on his fingers , his sandals inlaid with gems . He spoke in perfect Greek , with the intonations and mellifluousness of a scholar , and statues as stately as he stood all about him in carved niches . He embraced Hillel first , and let a tear come into his eye . " My dear Hillel , " he said , " this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us not repine too much . You appear well , for all your tribulations . " Hillel had always detested him , in spite of his own kind and gentle nature . He said , " My tribulations come from God and so I do not reject them , knowing , in humility that God , blessed be His Name , has His reasons , which are full of lovingkindness . " He felt this in his heart . Nevertheless , he knew it would annoy Shebua , who looked at him with sudden sharper reserve and said , " Ah , yes . We can do nothing but accept . All else is childish . " He sighed . " Deborah was my only daughter . As Rachel was to her father , so was she to me . " He thought that would please or at least divert Hillel . One must concede exceptions for these pious Jews , especially Pharisees who could make themselves disconcertingly dangerous . In an odd way , he was never sure about Hillel . The family of Borush was very distinguished and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their name was notable , so Shebua could not understand the unaffected simplicity of Hillel . He had half persuaded himself it was the  | pretense of an assured man , and Shebua ben Abraham was not such a man . Saul had been acutely observing his grandfather , whom he had never seen before . Shebua stood tall over Hillel , and was very lean and graceful , with long thin white hands and a long thin white face and a similar neck . He had a delicate nose , slender and attenuated , with tremulous nostrils , and his mouth was also delicate and almost invariably sweetly smiling . Friends had often informed him that he resembled one of the more patrician Greek scholars of antiquity , and this was not entirely flattery . His expression was amiable , patient , honeyed and sympathetic , conveying the message that not only was Shebua a gentleman of refinement but a man who was loving in the extreme , and full of sensibility , not to mention subtlety . One did not think of the great stern patriarchs when looking upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldliness . His brow was like marble , his thin hair pale and silken over his long skull . It was only when one looked into his unusually large and almost completely colorless eyes that one saw the glaucous nature of Shebua ben Abraham , the glacial weighing and measuring of all who encountered him , the cold indifference to the spirits , sufferings , pain and torment of others , and the gigantic self-absorption and selfishness . But few discerned all this . He had an undeserved reputation for benign tenderness for every man . He puts my teeth on edge , thought Saul , and his own teeth clenched hard together . He did not know that Clodia Flavius , wife of David , often made this remark to her husband . Now the bright but pallid eye of Shebua fell on his grandson , Saul ben Hillel . While ostensibly greeting Hillel he had seen Saul obliquely and had said to himself , What an ugly youth , barbarian in his appearance , a veritable Vandal ! He had heard from David that Saul was not similar to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes of his dead mother , and Deborah , in her letters to her father , had often complained that her son did not resemble his parents and was even ugly . Though she had not been intelligent she had a facile gift for words end had described Saul regularly , and minutely , so Shebua was not too startled . But he felt an immediate aversion for that flaming red hair , so puissant and leonine , that breadth of shoulder , and those metallic blue eyes , and the bowed legs discernible even under the long brown tunic . The feet , in heavy leather sandals , stood firm and stalwart on the gleaming white floor of the atrium , and to Shebua they were the feet of a wrestler or a pugilist . I !  | Shebua had no beard to kiss , so Saul suffered the perfumed embrace of Shebua in silence . ( He was scented with sandalwood . ) His young body stiffened ; only long training in courtesy kept him from drawing away his cheeks from Shebua 's cool kisses . Then , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandson off from him and his whole face expressed affection and pride . " My beloved Deborah 's only son ! " he exclaimed and again a soft tear appeared at the corner of his eyes . " Welcome to this house , Saul ben Hillel , and may you be joyful in the land of your fathers ! " Hypocrite , thought young Saul and his face was stiff . Shebua , who was very intuitive , felt the youth 's repugnance and his thoughts , and the pale eyes narrowed to icy slits . But he continued to smile as with love and admiration . He patted Saul 's shoulder , then turned graciously to view his granddaughter , Sephorah , and for once his smile was genuine as well as sweet . He not only thought her beautiful and nubile ; he also thought she had inherited his own Grecian appearance . He embraced her , and sighed . He had loved his daughter , Deborah . Sephorah was more wonderful in appearance than Deborah had been and as Shebua cherished beauty  --  he admitted this , himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl . His grandson , Ezekiel , was lucky ; there was also a fine dowry . He murmured in the words of Homer , as he had murmured to the dead Deborah , " ' Daughter of the gods , divinely tall and most divinely fair ! " ' Sephorah suppressed a chuckle . She was certain her grandfather was a mountebank but was amused rather than revolted at the thought . She considered it very discourteous of Saul to stand there and glare so straightly at Shebua as if about to challenge him . Shebua entered genially and gently into an affable exchange of greetings with Aulus Platonius , for the Roman was not only a Roman officer but of a sturdy and wealthy family . Aulus , as an " old " Roman , thought Shebua effete and wearisome and rarely encountered him willingly , and to Aulus it was not strange that Shebua was the intimate of both Herod Antipas and the Procurator of Israel , Pontius Pilate . Both were depraved men , though Pilate was the more cruel and intelligent . He had only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was not of the fiber and the soul of Aulus ' patriotic , sober and industrious fathers . Pilate hated the Jews because he had been sent here , on a matter of discipline , by Caesar Tiberius , and because the Jews were not subservient to the Romans and refused to bow before them and were incalcitrant . He was beginning to make it difficult for his officers and underlings to marry Jewish women , out of pure malice . He often ral-  | lied Aulus on his Hannah and once or twice had even tweaked the centurion 's beard and said , " What ! Are you becoming a Jew , my Aulus , and have you been circumcised ? " Only military training had kept Aulus from expressing his hatred , for to him , as to most soldiers , the decadent men of modern Rome were an affront to the gods , an insult to the history of his nation . The overseer of the hall entered the atrium , bowed to Shebua and announced that the Lady Clodia awaited the Lady Sephorah in the quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ granddaughter , spread his hands in apology and resignation , and said , " My ton 's wife , the noble Clodia Flavius , is mistress of her house and one dares not oppose her ! So you must retire , my Sephorah , my beautiful one , for refreshment and rest after your long journey . " Sephorah bowed to him , to her father , then , drawing her filmy veil over her face she bowed to her uncles , to Aulus , but pretended , as was proper , that she did not see her bridegroom who was lingering in the background , half hidden by a column , overcome with his shyness and the marvel of his fate that he was to have one so wondrous as his wife . Then Sephorah demurely winked at her brother , kissed her father 's cheek in a marvelous imitation of a timid daughter , and departed with her maidens for the women 's quarters . " We live under a quaint rule , " said Shebua . He then conducted the guests into the magnificent dining room for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian cook of great ent . The women 's quarters were not luxurious nor very handsome . They bad the austerity of old Rome about them and there were few ornaments and only the statues of Clodia 's family gods and her Tares and penates . There were no murals here and the lamps were plain and unscented and the curtains over the uncolored Alexandrine glass of the windows were of coarse wool striped in the red , black and white hues of the Tribe of Levi , to which Shebua ben Abraham belonged . Sephorah thought it amusing , but not incongruous nor discordant , to find here ? mixture of both Roman and Jewish customs and furnishing , for there s a curious resemblance and harmony between them . She realized at once that they were also anachronistic in this modern age of Hellenistic Jews and opulent Romans and degenerate Greeks . Clodia was seated within her own portico in an oaken chair with no cushions nor fringes , and she was like Demeter in her repose and digpity . About her her women were not idle ; they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was night and the lamps were not many . Clodia , herself , held a heap of linen on her broad knees and she was apparently mending it . She raised her calm brown eyes to Sephorah 's face , scrutinized her sharply and briefly , saw all , smiled with reserve and held out her hand to the girl . Sephorah kissed it with a fine affectation of humility , and Clodia 's eyes suddenly twinkled . She rose , embraced Sephorah . She smelled of fresh bread and clean strong flesh and warmth . " Greetings , my child , " she said , in Latin . " My son , Ezekiel , is greatly honored and blessed in you . " Her coarse brown hair was partly covered with the same plain cloth as her stola , and they were both of a dull deep red . Her hands were the hands of a woman who was not ashamed to use them in labor or in the soil , and were dark and short . She was not so tall as Sephorah . She was , indeed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fashion of an " old " Roman , and her sons and her daughters feared her with excellent reason . Though her daughters were married , as were all her sons but Ezekiel , her youngest , they observed the most meticulous and deferential deportment in their mother 's presence . Her features were large and coarse and firm , but when she smiled her expression was truly kind and benevolent . Sephorah loved her at once , for here was all sincerity and truth . Clodia and Sephorah dined together in Clodia 's austere dining room , which was small and dimly lighted . But the curtains were drawn back for the warm night wind and Sephorah saw the mingled red and white illumination of Jerusalem and heard the dull thunder of the unsleeping city . She also heard fountains , plangent and soothing , and distant laughter and music and the rumble of chariots . She could smell rich gardens and fruit . The crescent new moon stood on tiptoe on a dark mountain . Though Sephorah was tired , she was filled with excitement and anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dined very simply on broiled fish , hot breads and stewed beans with garlic and cheese and a very ordinary wine , which Clodia favored . The gentlemen 's dinner was quite different , which Sephorah suspected , but Clodia preferred a plain life for herself and her women . There was a rustic basket of fruit on the table , which was covered by a yellowish cloth , and the perfume of it mingled with the flower scents from the gardens and the pervading peppery and aromatic odor of the city . She is dressed and gemmed finely , thought Clodia , and is of delicate structure and proud bearing , but she is one like myself and I am pleased . She inquired politely of Sephorah 's journey , offered her con-  | dolences for the death of the girl 's mother , and conveyed her unbending and formidable serenity to Sephorah who did not find it intimidating . In truth , the girl 's weariness relaxed and she found herself confiding in Clodia as if she were her mother , and some of her remarks were so witty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composure and ease , her charming face , her smiles , gratified the Roman lady . The girl was not impudent as were the majority of maidens in these deplorable days , and there was no impertinence in her voice , nor was she affected or brazen . They drank wine in warm comfort together and ate of the luscious fruit . Sephorah began to speak of her brother and her anxious love for him shone in her golden eyes . She told Clodia of the strangeness which had come to him in the past year , and the fixity and gloom which nothing could shake . " Ah , " said Clodia , " I saw him from my portico , in the light of the lamps at the entrance to the atrium . He stood apart . That very unusual for a youth , for the young are always chattering . Does love no one ? " " None but God and my father , " said Sephorah with some melanoly . " Once he loved me . But no more . He repudiates me and thinks trivial . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She held a handful of sweet ripe dates in her hand d she munched on them thoughtfully . Then she said , " I have seen a young men like your brother , Saul ben Hillel , but very few . He ails my own brothers to me . We , too , were stringent before our gods d loved our country with fervor . At times , " and now she suddenly ked at Sephorah and the usually unrelenting brown eyes were amazingly merry , " I found it tiresome . Of a certainty , I never implied is to my father and my brothers , nor to my husband , David ben Shebua , but women have more humor than men . " Sephorah was freshly delighted by this Roman lady . The two women w more comfortably together . " Virtue , " said Clodia , " is most necessary and discipline can not be overpraised . We must learn this , my child , or we can not endure in a world of men . We must be sleeplessly controlled and firm and guide them ruthlessly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be veritable Penelopes on this gross , masculine earth , veritable Junos  --  or our men will become barbarians . It is their nature , though they pretend , in these days , to be of excessive rements and daintiness . Alas , modern women , striving to be as corrupt as men , as vicious as men , as free as men , are hastening us all to destruction . There are few virtuous women alive in these evil times , and only they can delay the inevitable hour of death , blood and confusion . "  | She sighed , studied a pomegranate in its basket , then took up a red globe . She regarded Sephorah with interest . The girl 's face was somewhat disturbed . Clodia said , " Do not be sad , my daughter . Civilizations come , and they go . The seed of their death lies in them at their birth . It is inexorable fate , ordained by the gods . Still , " she added , " I often yearn for what I have not had . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting . " Shebua ben Abraham mentioned to me , with amusement , that the Pharisee Jews believe in reincarnation , " said Clodia Flavius , rubbing the pomegranate frankly on her knee . " If I were to be given a choice , in the event there is truth in that theory , I should like to be a courtesan . " " A courtesan ! " exclaimed Sephorah , and her face came alight with dimples . " Then I would not have to be virtuous , " said Clodia . " I am like a weary soldier on guard . " Sephorah laughed , but for some reason unknown even to her , she felt tears in her eyes . She rose quickly to her feet and approached Clodia and fell on her neck and kissed her , and then did not know why she cried . And Clodia held her in her stout arms and soothed her as she had never soothed her own daughters , and murmured wordlessly in her ear and kissed her cheek . Sephorah sat on her knee like a child and wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in upon them and were astonished . It was midnight and Saul lay in sweating exhaustion in his fine bedroom in the house of Shebua ben Abraham , and his spirit was in darkness and in pain . He had recited his prayers with fervor , this first night in the land of his fathers , but they had brought him no comfort . So he rose from his heated bed , covered his head with a cloth , bent over as if in agony , and murmured aloud in the words of David : " 0 Lord , rebuke me not in Your wrath , neither chasten me in Your hot displeasure ! For Your arrows stick fast in me and Your hand presses me sore . There is no soundness in my flesh because of Your anger , neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin . My iniquities are gone over my head ; as a heavy burden they are too heavy for me . My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness . I am troubled ; I am bowed down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease , and there is no soundness in my flesh . I am feeble and sore broken ; I have roared by reason of the disquietness of my heart . Lord , all my desire is before You , and my groaning is not hid from You . My heart pants , my strength  | falls me ; as for the light of my eyes , it is also gone from me ? Forsake ow not , 0 Lord ! 0 my God , be not far from me ! " On so many endless nights before he had prayed thus in despair and In fever , and in utter faith . Yet never had he been comforted , never bad he felt forgiven , never had he felt the imminence of God as once he had felt it . Something obstinately cold and dark had fallen between in and God . He believed it was his sin , for which he could not forgive mself . Once , during his interlude with Dacyl , he had loved all mankind , for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and it was one with her . Now that he believed he loathed Dacyl and hated her , so those somber emotions lay on all the world of men , emanating from himself . As he had repudiated Dacyl , so he repudiated his fellows and despised them , for were they not depraved and corrupt as Dacyl  --  and himself ? He could not forgive himself . Therefore , he could not forgive nor endure mankind . Could not God , blessed be His Name , read his heart , know his contrition and sorrow and disgust ? Why then , did silence answer in him , and long loneliness and emptiness , as if in reproach ? It was said that the Lord did not reject the repentant , but hastened to meet them in lovingkindness . But though Saul had repented , the portals of communion with God had closed and he was left in harreness and dryness among evil men , and there was muteness and despair in his soul . In broken exhaustion , he fell on his hot bed again and was instantly asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he slept and the crescent moon fell behind the mountains and a new breeze chattered amid the palms , he heard a great and tremendous voice : " Saul ! Saul of Tarshishl " He sprang up in bed , sweat dripping from him , his eyes wild and staring in the darkness . He cried , " Yes , yes ! Who is it ? Who calls ? " The very walls were still ringing with the sound of that unearthly voice , that commanding voice , that terrible and masculine voice . A fierce pain ran through the young man 's head , and he panted . He listened with all his power . He heard , now , only the light dry wind and the call of a lonely bird and the distant howl of a jackal , and the trumpet challenge of a guard . I was dreaming , he told himself at last . But it was dawn before he slept again . Then he thought , " Though He reject me and will not forgive me , though His rage shall flow over me like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and serve Him with all my soul , and at the last He may receive me again .  | He wept and said in the words of Job , " Oh , that I but knew where I might find Him ! " SAUL went with his father and his kinsmen to the Temple on the Holy Days , and Sephorah went to the Court of the Women for her religious duties . The youth had a tremendous imagination and he had listened to his father discourse on the Temple , on its golden dome , its spires , its many courts , its gardens and walls and corridors , its vast halls where learned men walked and contemplated and conversed of sacred matters , its cypresses and palms and fountains , its quiet colonnades . He knew that the first Temple of Solomon had employed over seventy thousand men in the building of it , and that it had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar , king of Babylon , and that it had been restored by Zerubbabel seventy years later , and that even later it had been enhanced and enlarged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellow and white stones of its walls , its mighty bronze doors , its great columns pale and polished like marble , its huge capitals embossed with pomegranates , buds of flowers , lilies , wreaths , its arches leading to long vistas , its quiet porticoes , its wide low steps , and the cloud of incense which hovered everywhere , brightened by sun or moon . He had heard of the altar and the Holy of Holies , the Tabernacle , the veiled Torah , the scrolls wrapped around the silver rods , the hushed and solemn air , the shining floors , the silences , the dim rolling echoes . Hillel had told him of the holy maidens , widows and men who had their being in the Temple and never left it , and were seen only at a distance . There had long been a tradition that the Mother of the Messias would spend her early years in this sanctuary , in the Presence of God . Saul had been prepared for glory and splendor and sacred precincts , but he saw now that what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reality . Here was the heart of his people , the Tabernacle of their God , the soul of their being , their fortitude , their faith , their stubborn devotion , their pride , their honor and their dignity . Who could prevail against a people who had raised this House to the Lord their God , and who had kept it holy and immaculate and glowing , and who turned their eyes to it at dawn and at sunset ? Hillel had said , " So shall it live in the spirits of the People of God ,  | though it be thrown one stone from another , its walls shattered , its dome splintered , its columns fallen , as it has been prophesied . Let the rage of the Gentiles , as David has said , prevail against its mere being in time . But ever shall it live , loved , revered , yearned for , desired with a terrible desiring , by all Jews through the ages , though they lose their faith and are scattered . For it is our heart , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , the Invisible worshiped in invisibility  --  until the Messias arrive , blessed be His Name , triumphant and invincible , Father of the world to come , and He shall raise the Temple again in the twinkling of an eye for the awe of nations , to be a sanctuary for all men . " But Saul did not believe that this edifice , this worship in stone raised to God , would ever be lost to the sight of humanity , nor could he believe , though it had been prophesied , that it would be mankind 's Banctuary , Jew and Gentile , heathen and barbarian . The very thought appeared blasphemous to him . And it seemed even more blasphemous that he , the defiled and the corrupt and the sinful , dared enter here , his hood over his face for fear that God might smite him for his presumption . He found himself numb of lip and soul as he stood with the multitude of hooded men before the altar in the greatest of the Courts : in the blue dimness of incense and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they repeated the prayers until the vastness of the place seemed invaded by a deep and unearthly wind that did not come from human throats . It was the movement of Hosts , invisible though clothed in white fire . Saul watched the priests and saw their upraised hands and eyes and their long beards and their sacramental garments and heard their intonations and the echo of their intonations and a terror seized him and a cold ecstasy , and when the crowds of men prostrated themselves and he with them he found it impossible to rise again and his father , with an expression of concern , helped him to his feet . Hillel , even in those holy moments , was appalled by his son 's face , so awful was the light of his eyes , so fixed and stretched his features . There was a line of foam on his white mouth . He appeared dazed , at once stricken and lost , yet exalted . Hillel had heard of the transports of men touched by the Finger of God , and he was frightened . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that rapture . Hillel desired that his son love God , but he also desired that God not love him too much . There was a terribleness in the Love of God , and wise men , though desiring to be loved by their Almighty Father , rarely prayed for favors and commands that could be devastating and de-  | stroying . It was all very well for transports , provided that they did not transport men beyond the reach of other men , and did not consume poor human flesh in the flame . The vessel of flesh was entirely too frail to hold the fiery essence of the Being of God , and Saul was Hillel 's only son and even for God he did not wish him to be consumed . Saul was trembling . His breath came hard and fast . He stared at the Tabernacle ; he shook as if in a gale . Hillel held Saul 's arm against his own body and pressed it as if he would protect his son from God , Himself . Saul was crying in himself , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silent ! I cry by night , and You permit me ! " The words of David rang through his soul , imploring , worshiping , yearning . " Whither shall I go from Your Spirit ? Or whither shall I flee from Your Presence ? If I ascend up into Heaven , You are there . If I make my bed in Hell , behold ! You are there ! If I take the wings of the morning and dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea  --  Even there shall Your Hand lead me , and Your right Hand shall hold me . If I say , Surely the darkness shall cover me , ' even the night shall be light about me  --  The darkness and the light are both alike to You , 0 my God and my Redeemer ! " The fearful estrangement he had felt for so long , the estrangement of God from him , was lifted in one flash for a brief moment , and it seemed to him that he was on the verge of some transcendent discovery and knowledge , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live , and without which he would surely die . His whole being urged toward that revealment ; it reached like a hand for it , craving , hungry , desperate , and he did not know where he was or who upheld him . And then it was gone . I am unworthy , he thought . I am guilty . I saw the trailing garment of Glory for one instant , and then It withdrew . Tears ran down his face and there was a groaning in his throat which only his father , mercifully , heard . Then tears came to Hillel 's eyes also and he prayed , " Depart from my poor son , lest he die . " It was then that in this fragrant blue gloom , amid the echoing wind of men 's prayers , Hillel saw that his kinsmen had now observed Saul and himself . He saw the bored incurious face of Shebua ben Abraham , pale under the shadow of his hood , the superb , and knowing smiles exchanged between Simon and Joseph  --  their cheeks were sleek  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernible . And Hillel was ashamed of his own fear , remorseful to the heart that he had asked God not to touch his son , and angered , even in those holy moments , that the family of Shebua should mock the passionate  | communion of his son , they who knew not God , blessed be His Name , and had never desired to know Him . Hillel could have wept with his anger and his self-reproach and his desire to cover his son with his own cloak , hiding him from the eyes of these profane men who profaned the Holy of Holies by their presence , and found it a cause for silent mirth that a youth should be so transported and exalted , and should believe even to the edge of fainting or death . The tall candles were lit along the walls , in their silver sconces ; lamps brightened . There was a sound of great golden trumpets ; the columns glowed with shifting incandescence . The high priest was drawing the veil that hid the Torah , the holy scrolls , and men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ golden dome above was lost in vagrant shadows and the clouds of incense . But Hillel , who had put his arm over his son 's shoulders even as they lay side by side , felt that this most sacred of moments had been ruined for him because he knew that close to him lay men in mockery , men faithless and impious and desecrating , obeying the letter of the Law because they considered it correct though the Spirit was far from them . For them , surely , there was no forgiveness , these abominable Sadducees ! They sought men 's approval even here , and blasphemed God in their hearts . The thought that he and Saul would feast with them tonight was repugnant to Hillel ben Borush . Their bread and their meats , their succulent dishes and spicy sauces , their wines and their fruit , their laughter and their jests , seemed to Hillel more than he could endure , and his heart was hot within him and he felt a deep burning and sorrow in his breast , not only for his son but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be mocked any longer . They were standing again . The Ark of the Covenant was hidden once more , and the prayers were resumed . Hillel saw that Saul was more composed , and that his lips were moving . He entered into his contemplations , his own prayers . The candles and the lamps flared ; a soft but penetrating music of zither and flute invaded the silence , an accompaniment to devotions , and in emphasis there was an occasional clash of a muted cymbal , the murmur of harps , the somber sound of chanting . All conscious thought was lost in Saul , whose very soul seemed drained and prostrated . Then , all at once , he was acutely and even frightfully aware , as if a hand of flame had touched his flesh and had seared it . He swung his head about . He saw nothing but the dimmed forms of men about him ; he heard their breathing , their praying , and even their faint cries . All  | were hooded . He could see nothing of their faces but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wisp or two of their beards . Many there were richly clad , nobly arrayed . But near Saul , as he saw for the first time , was a small group of men in the coarse garments and cloaks of countrymen , their leather sandals plain and undecorated , their folded hands rude and scarred by toil . They wore no jewels to flash in the light as did his kinsmen ; their beards were not scented , neither was their flesh . They smelled of the field and the hills , of domestic animals and goat 's hair , of cheese and rough dark bread and sour milk and stale oil . Not even sedulous ablutions could obliterate these odors , which now so permeated their bodies . But Saul , newly dazed and again trembling , felt that from one among them had darted a lance of flame which had touched him . He stared at them . They prayed with quiet fervor . Nothing distinguished them from their fellows ; in truth , the haughtier and richer of the men of Jerusalem had tried to put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Before God , they often said , all men were the same . But they did not believe it . For , was it not said that the just were favored with worldly goods by a rewarding Lord , blessed be His Name , and that they were never forsaken by Him and their children never begged bread ? A destitute man , a poor and humble man , a miserable toiler , then , was indubitably a sinner and deserving of his fate . The probability that they , themselves , were truly forsaken and that their children might beg in vain for the Bread of Life , did not occur to them , and had one spoken to them of this they would not only have been outraged but made wrathful and vengeful . What ? Who ? thought Saul , with a kind of anxious fever . He had often heard of the poverty-stricken but holy and wandering rabbis of Israel , who frequently evoked miracles and who preached in the streets and in the dust to the heedless mobs , and who devoted their lives to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God . " They care not for money nor for rich meats and bread , or even for shelter and warmth or for protection against the rain and the sun , " Hillel had told his son . " They sleep in barns or under arches and on thresholds , and desire nothing but service , nothing but prayer , nothing but the opportunity to extend compassion and hope to others . They are the blessed of God . " Was there one such among that group of countrymen ? asked Saul to himself . It seemed to him that he must know , that he must approach them and lift a hood to search for a face , for a spirit which had touched him invisibly but with power . He was filled with longing , with an ur-  | gent hope . His old impulsiveness returned to him , his old recklessness to have what he desired to have . He made a movement . It was then that he was certain that a strong and familiar voice said within the hot cave of his skull : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He thought , I am going mad ! I did not hear a voice , yet I swear I heard it ! I am undone . My emotions are in disarray . Wild winds disturb my soul . Suffering has distorted my perceptions . My God , my God , why have You abandoned me ? But even as he thought this a heavy peace came to him , a quietude , a surcease , as if a kind and merciful hand had been placed on his incoherent and clamorous mouth . He sank into mute prayer , into a soundlessness that was like sleep . Though Clodia Flavius had commanded her Jewish cooks to prepare the proper feast for the Holy Days , and no rich and ritualistic dish had been excluded , and the prescribed wines had been provided , the prayers and ceremonies at the table in the magnificent dining room were languid and perfunctory . The goblets might be of gold and the platters and plates of the finest wrought silver , the spoons and the knives of artful Egyptian charm , the wreathed candlesticks and lamps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold , the Alexandrine glass and crystal vases filled with scarlet and white and purple flowers , but there was none of the sober gaiety that follows the Day of Atonement , when men believe fervently that the book of their last year 's sins had been closed by the Angel of God and a new year of hope and faith lies before them . Shebua ben Abraham and his sons and their sons did not wear the embroidered and jeweled caps befitting their situation in society . They did not wear caps at all . Hillel ben Borush and his son Saul wore them only . They had listened to Shebua 's desultory and abbreviated prayers and they detected the faint and indulgent amusement in his creamy voice , and the ennui . They knew he was making a polite gesture in the direction of the faith he had abandoned , even as atheistic Romans and Greeks poured libations to the gods . It was a pretty gesture , and , Hillel suspected , even that was made only because of the presence of himself and Saul . Shebua was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were anything else , for though Hillel listened keenly he never once heard Shebua make an original remark though he was very proficient in quotations from the mighty Greek philosophers and Virgil and Homer  --  which he delivered with a graceful wave of his hand and a soft smile that requested admiration . Even these remarks , virile and  | passionate often in context , exuded desultory daintiness . I am sure , thought Hillel , who was rarely moved to deep vexation  --  knowing the frailties of men  --  that even his excrement is perfumed and his urine scented . How he had brought himself to the sweat and lustiness and violent thrust of begetting these sons of his is beyond my imagination . He has two concubines . I am certain they are still virgins ; no doubt he delights them with a lyre or poems or pretty little songs ! Or , thought Hillel , becoming more and more incensed , it may be that he is a practicer of Platonic love , in imitation of the Greeks . He glanced down the gleaming table at his father-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ebony and pearl-inlaid chair ; he played with his goblet ; he ate with an air of absent discrimination , every gesture excessively refined . His blue tunic , belted with an intricate web of gold and gems , was heavily embroidered ; his arms were banded in armlets , glittering like stars , and on his right index finger was a fine ring which Herod Antipas had given him for favors  --  or friendship  --  unknown . He had refrained from the last enormity : Egyptian necklaces , fringed with gold and jewels , and earrings . These he had left to David ben Shebua . Again , Hillel thought that David was a parody of his father , and then he felt he was unkind . David had more intelligence than his sire , and was capable of a little originality and a little sudden imagination . Perhaps that was why Shebua disliked him more than he disliked the more pragmatic and avaricious Simon and Joseph , who made no pretense at scholarship and were frankly worldly and unashamed of their worldliness . The dining room was finer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pontius Pilate , as they had admitted , themselves . It was , in truth , a banquet hall , of the purest white marble imported from Italy . No color touched it except for the passionately colored murals on the white walls , beautifully executed by the best of artists , the thrown Persian carpets and the high ceiling of fretted copper in a maze of entwining forms and angles . The snowy columns of Corinthian design  --  no Ionian simplicity for Shebua  --  had their capitals delicately tinted . And on pedestals , in niches , stood nude and indelicate little statuettes of white marble brought from Greece . The evening was hot . The bronze doors stood open and the pale silken curtains had been drawn back , and Jerusalem lay below them on her hills , tier rising upon tier , sharply illuminated . They could hear the fountains outside , musically laughing to the stars , and could smell the fragrance of warm gardens under the dew . Everything that  | met the eye was entrancing , and Hillel appreciated it , but did not appreciate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgetting the graceful conversation about the table for a moment , looked at the young man who would marry Sephorah . Certainly he was not handsome , like his father , David , but neither did he resemble his grandfather Shebua ben Abraham , thanks be to God , blessed be His Name . The youth was shy and silent , but his eyes were very blue and candid , his expression alert yet retiring . He sat next to Saul who was very gray of face tonight and whose features were set in a tense and inflexible look , as if his thoughts were far from this room and his kinsmen and were bent on seeking , yet in terror of the seeking . His coarse white linen tunic did nothing to enhance his appearance , nor did that vital flare of red hair and the deep lost blue metal of his eyes . The prophets had often spoken of the fire that inflamed their hearts with love of God , for the fire was love given and received , and it was rapture and ecstasy . ( 0 Love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot burn of tears in his eyes . But this was not the love which the son knew , for all his transports in the Temple . ) Hillel sighed again , and turned with pain from his son and listened to his boring fatherin-law again . Then he spoke . " Shebua , you have been conversing of the wonderful conceptual abstractions of the Greeks , out of which rose their code of ethics  --  which they observe no longer . Anything based on abstractions is alien to the flesh and the life of men ; abstractions are the toys of the effete mind , which will endure no suffering or the sight or sound of suffering , or any of the fevers and sores and agonies of the fleshparticularly of other men . I not only call this trivial , and insulting to the manhood of humanity , but disgusting . Words are no substitute for actualities , nor exquisite phrases a poultice for reality . Men are born ; they excrete and fornicate and void ; they are tortured in their flesh . They smell . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sleep . They eat . They beget . They die . These are the earthly and immutable verities of our being , our flesh . We can not disguise them forever in the silk and embroideries of what you choose to call Greek civilization , or any other civilization , or in cantos or pentameters , however pretty , however sublime . I do not denigrate poetry or music or any of the other decorations men can invent , for life is not lovely , not comely , for man or beast , I admire , while I pity , these desperate efforts to hide the appalling face of reality , for none can bear the vision long with tranquillity , or without the help of God . Or without softening  | her lineaments with the veil of art . But we must admit it is only a veil . If we do not , then we shall surely go mad . " Shebua narrowed his pale eyes upon him and began to speak , but Hillel lifted his hand . " I beg your forbearance for a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was boring Simon and Joseph . They had fastened a look of exaggerated filial respect on their father while he had been speaking before Hillel 's interruption , and he had bored them even more . They did not conceal their ennui from Hillel , and leaned back in their chairs with expressions of resignation . " You would say , " Hillel continued , " that art and the graces of the mind distinguish us from beasts . But , we are beasts with them ! I do not call this degrading ; I call this coming to terms with reality . From that strong base we can proceed , and we must never deny it for if we do  --  again  --  we shall go mad . It is said that animals have no souls ; I dispute this . It is of no moment . You have implied that animals have no code of ethics . Who has enlightened you on this ? I have seen animals and birds with more mercy and solicitude for their kind than any man has displayed ! Animals do not betray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they do not enslave ; they do not sin . They have their being , and their being is honest , and who can say this of man ? It was necessary for men to invent ethics , for , before God , blessed be His Name , man was not born with ethics , nor could he survive without them ! He is the fierce devourer of his brother , a cannibal , and no other animal is such except rats , who disquietingly resemble man . " As an exercise in grace and in handsome reason , I admire the intellectual code of ethics of the Greeks . I admire the Roman hubris , the pride of country and race . I admire the Roman law , for it is based on human reality as the ethics of the Greeks are not . But as neither the ethics of the Greeks nor the Law of the Romans is based on God and the Reality of God , they have no true verity except in the most narrow of senses . It is only the ancient laws of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , which can survive in this world , for they are cast in mercy , in compassion , in love , in justice  --  all the attributes of God . " To us , life is sacred , and this is true of no other religion , no code of merely mortal ethics , however grand the language or profound the thought . The Greeks were never urged to love their fellowman ; the idea is preposterous to the Romans . So it was to the Babylonians and the Egyptians , except for one very brief period in Egyptian history far long ago . Only to Jews is human life sacred . Only to us was given the Commandment : Thou shalt not kill ! I will concede that we have obeyed this Commandment no more heartily , in our past , though we knew of  | it , than the other peoples obeyed , and they knew it not . Yet , it is there . Thou shalt not kill ! For uncountable generations the Greeks have practiced infanticide . They find nothing immoral in that . They say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Romans have begun to practice it also , and feel no repugnance , no guilt . Other nations have practiced this direful crime , without horror . But Jews do not practice infanticide . They do not kill lightly , and wars are no occasion for rejoicing , though we are a warrior people . For God has warned us not to kill . He has warned us to love and revere and fear Him , and to love our fellows . " Surely , Shebua ben Abraham , you will admit that our ethics , based on God , are superior to the ethics of the Greeks and the Romans ! And that our civilization , however it amuses you , is more attuned to the nature of man and God than any other ! " Saul , stricken and mute , had begun to listen . He looked with astonishment at his father and did not know him , for the usually gentle and conciliating Hillel had a tawny flame in his eyes and his face was deeply flushed . You are very eloquent , Hillel ben Borush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow of malevolence on it now . " I can hardly believe this of a rigid Pharisee , for Pharisees are notoriously devoid of both eloquence and subtlety . But I concede nothing of what you have spoken , nor do I admit the verity of it . You speak as a Jew ? " " And you are not a Jew ! " exclaimed Hillel , and the hand he had laid on the table trembled with wrath . Shebua glanced slowly at his sons and smiled faintly . " We are citizens of the world , " he said . " We believe in mankind , if we do not believe in God . We believe that man has infinite possibilities and potencialities , and that he will rise to them when he has abandoned superstition and relies only on himself . We are men now , not children . We need no staff of immolating idolatry and craven fear of the Invisible to sustain us . We need no commandments but our own superior minds , and the probabilities of our minds . We no longer hear God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not fire on Sinai . It is natural and mindless lightning . We do not dwell in tents now , nor are we barbarians . For children there are the beliefs of children , and the little fears and terrors , for they know nothing and have no knowledge . But we are men in these days , and we know what sustains a man and what hidden strengths lie in man , and we will evoke them . " " Oh ! " cried Hillel , with unusual passion . " You have embraced the folly of pride  --  and how dare man be proud ? Of what can he be proud ?
