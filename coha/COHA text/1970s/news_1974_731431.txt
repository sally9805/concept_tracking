txt It 's a metal tube some six feet in length and a foot in diameter , filled with an exotic metal that has the unusual ability to mix with hydrogen gas . Surrounded by a mass of pipes and dials. the tube resembles a faintly menacing weapon . But despite its ominous appearance , this is a device to preserve , not destroy . Part of a research project sponsored by the Atomic Energy Commission and Public Service Electric &; Gas , a New Jersey utility , the machine helps turn electricity into hydrogen and then back into electricity . The first of its land , it is still in a clumsy experimental stage at the utility 's research labo- , ratory here . But someday it may help solve ' one of the nation 's most pressing technological problems : how to efficiently store eleci tricity for future use . Although Thomas Edison 's first electric-1 power station began humming back in the 1880s , scientists have n't yet learned how to package electricity conveniently " so it can be left on the shelf in large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vice President Arthur Bueche . Right now , he says , " well over 99% of the electricity we use is generated at virtually the instant we use it . " ( The rest is channeled into a few cumbersome pumped-water storage systems . ) How to Harness a Current By the year 2000 , Mr. Bueche predicts , some 15% of the electricity generated in the U.S. will be drawn from stored reserves . Without storage , many energy experts fear the U.S. faces widespread power shortages during the hours of the day when demand from homes , offices and factories is at its peak . Already , some urban areas are experiencing " brownouts " on very cold or very hot days when demand for electricity outstrips a utility 's generating capacity . And electricity use  --  which last year accounted for 26% of all energy consumed in the U.S. ? is expected to rise to about 50% by the turn of the century . Visions of the power squeeze to come have prompted utilities to look for ways to store electricity during periods of low demand for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moving current ca n't be physically contained in the way that other energy sources , such as coal , oil or uranium , can . Once created , electricity must have somewhere to go . Thus , most experimental storage schemes either convert electricity generated at nonpeak hours into another substance or use it to perform tasks like spinning a wheel , pumping water or compressing air . This harnessed energy can then be turned back into electricity at periods of peak demand . The hydrogen system appears promising for future storage , as do new long-lasting batteries that operate at high temperatures . Scientists are also considering using electricity to spin huge flywheels or to compress air in vast underground caverns . Only one type of experimental storage device , called a superconducting magnet , can actually hold an electrical current . But the technology needed to make it practical is n't yet available . The sophistication of these feats of transmutation helps explain their high cost . The government has allocated about $3.5 million for storage research in fiscal 1974 ( mainly through the AEC and the National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about $10 million next year . The utilities are spending $1 million on the problem this year , with a matching amount coming from industry . Utilities are willing to invest that kind of money because a practical storage device would enable them to generate power more economically . To understand why , it 's necessary to explain how electricity is currently supplied . Sending Up the Reserves To keep pace with power demands that fluctuate wildly ( consumption can double between dawn hours and midafternoon ) , most utilities currently operate a multitiered system of generating equipment that they call up in units as needed . New nuclear and fossil-fuel power stations make up the first string . These run around the clock because they represent a huge capital investment and offer low fuel costs . Ordinarily , these plants provide enough power for nighttime needs . But in the morning , when offices open and factory machinery starts up , the utilities must also bring on their second string : old power plants that use more fuel and thus are most costly to operate . Occasionally , all this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand for power . This may happen on a sultry summer afternoon when air conditioners are running full blast , or in midwinter , when thermostats are turned up high . At such times the utilities draw on their final line of defense , the gas turbine . This machine , which also powers jet aircraft , is relatively low-priced and can be quickly pressed into service to supply peakload demand . But it uses a lot of fuel , mainly oil or natural gas , and thus is expensive to operate . And , because turbines are noisy and emit noxious gases , utilities are meeting opposition to their use . With the cost of fossil fuels rising sharply , utilities would like to dismantle their costly old plants and turbines and build more new plants that could be operated flat out for 24 hours a day . Nuclear plants , with the lowest fuel costs of all , are especially attractive . A good storage system would justify investment in these plants because the excess electricity they generated at night and on weekends could be conserved for peak-demand hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only electricity storage system available . Although various complications limit its use to about 25 loca1 ons in this country , the principle behind water storage is simple : Electricity generated during periods of low demand is used to rump water from a massive reservoir up:ull into another reservoir When the electricity is needed , the water is allowed to run back downhill through the pumps , which then act as electrical generators But the system is n't especially efficient ; one-third of the energy used to pump the water uphill is lost in the downhill run ( In spite of the net loss of power , utilities that can use water storage find it more economical than operating costly gas turbines . ) Another drawback is the enormous capital cost involved The largest system in the world , owned by Consumers Power and Detroit Edison and located in Luddington , Mich. , cost $300 million and holds 27 billion gallons of water Finally , a pumped-storage station requires as much as 1,800 acres of land and mcuntainous terrain , usually placing it far from the city it serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the compactness of hydrogen storage persuaded Public Service Electric to install it at its laboratory . The utility is shouldering about $65,000 of a $1 million AEC research project aimed at improving the system . A Delicate Alchemy The apparatus that performs the delicate alchemy of turning electricity into gas is set up like an assembly line . A direct current flows through an electrolyzer , a device that produces hydrogen gas from water by ushig electricity to split the water molecules into separate atoms of hydrogen and oxygen The hydrogen is then pumped into a storage tube containing 1,000 pounds of a metal called iron-titanium . This metal , developed by AEC researchers , " grips " the molecules of gas , forming a tight bond called a metal hydride . When it is heated , the metal releases the hydrogen gas . Iron titanium 's unusual affinity for hydrogen vastly simplifies problems of storing the gas ; ordinarily , hydrogen must be kept under high pressure or in liquid form at a very low temperature . The utility 's research director , Raymond Huse , notes that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to produce electricity to light three large rooms for nine hours . Continuing along the assembly line , the hydrogen gas released from the metal is piped into a fuel cell , a device that produces electricity chemically when hydrogen reacts with oxygen . ( Pratt &; Whitney Aircraft division of United Aircraft is developing a 26-megawatt fuel cell under a $42 million program with nine utilities . The cell is being designed to provide enough electricity for a community of 20,000 . ) Finally , the recovered electricity flows into transmission lines . The major drawback of the hydrogen system is that only 18 , : of the electricity fed into it is recaptured . But , Mr. Huse says , " this is only a research project . We believe we can raise the efficiency to 507x . " Are Batteries Better ? A more efficient means of storage , some researchers believe , would be simply to produce electricity from a battery . The common lead-acid automobile battery was ruled out as a practical possibility ; it is too expensive and short-lived , and lead is in limited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a new battery technology that would overcome these problems . They came up with the sodium-sulphur battery . In principle , the new battery performs like its automotive cousin . Two different elements , in this case , sodium and sulphur , produce electricity by transferring atomic particles from one to another through an electrolyte , or conducting substance that carries electric current from the battery . But the sodiumsulphur battery is unusual in that it requires a temperature of about 662 degrees Fahrenheit to work . The heat keeps the chemicals in liquid form and increases the conductivity of the electrolyte , a ceramic compound called beta alumina . A number of companies are developing the battery , including Ford , General Motors and GE . Mr. Bueche of GE says the battery potentially offers five times more storage capacity per pound than the leadacid battery . Although many problems remain , among them the deterioration of the beta alumina and corrosion difficulties , British scientists already have used an experimental sodium-sulphur battery to power a small delivery van , and British Rail is talking of installing the battery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on the horizon that may prove even more promising . It , too , is a high-temperature battery , but the electrolyte is made up of molten salts , and the reacting elements on either side are lithiem and sulphur . Elton Cairns , a scientist at GM 's research laboratories who helped pioneer the battery at the AEC 's Argonne National Laboratory outside Chicago , believes it has the potential of lasting twice as long as the sodium-sulphur battery . But , he concedes , " there are still formidable materials problems to be solved , " mainly corrosion . Coming Full Circle Another scheme for storing electricity relies upon a mechanism that man has used for thousands of years : the flywheel . The mechanical energy released by the turn of a wheel has been used to drive the potter 's wheel since Biblical times , And the flywheel is commonly seen today in the automobile engine . The flywheel stores energy in much the same way that a bicycler , by peddling extra fast , can coast for a time on the excess energy he expends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , releases " stored " energy as it slows down . The amount of energy that can be stored depends on , among other things , how fast the flywheel is turned ; the faster it 's turned , the longer it takes to slow down . A wheel that spins at very high speeds ( many times the speed of sound ) will coast for several days , slowing down gradually . But use of the flywheel has long been limited by the fact that most materials  --  even steel  --  fly apart when turned too fast Now , new materials are being developed that bring the possibility of a high-speed flywheel closer . Only a short time ago , the period it took a flywheel to slow down and lose its energy was measured in seconds . Now it 's being measured in days , according to David Rabenhorst , a mechanical engineer at Johns Hcrkins University 's Applied Physics Laboratory . The AEC is financing a study by Mr. Rabenhorst that will assess the feasibility of using a massive flywheel system to store electricity . Mr. Rabenhorst is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a type of nylon that , he says , can be turned at several timesth.e speed of sound without flying apart . He suggests that for energy storage , a 200-ton spoked flywheel might be fashioned from one of these materials . In pericds of low demand , electricity would be used to spin the superflywheel at perhaps 3,500 revolutions a minute . It would then coast , in a near-vacuum to reduce energy hisses from air friction , until the hours of peak demand . The coasting flywheel would turn a generator to produce the extra electricity needed . During the next lull in electricity use , the flywheel would be " charged up " by increasing its speed . " If you tried hard enough you could make a flywheel that would coast for months , " Mr. Rabenhorst rays . He hopes to be able to build a demonstration plant by the end of the decade . Before then , experimental flywheels will be used to power municipal buses in San Francisco , and will be installed in trains , under a Department of Transportation program .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
