txt The New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera , beset by the high cost of performing and facing the prospect of reducing standards or raising ticket prices , will receive $6.3-million in Ford Foundation money , with the proviso that much of it be matched on a $2-to-$1 basis : The funds consist of $5.3-million in a seven-year agreement with the two constituents of the City Center of Music and Drama , as well as an earlier $1-million grant that had been expected to be repaid but now need not be if it is matched doubly . Richard M. Clurman , , City Center 's board chairman , said the agreement " gives us what we need to reach our goals and insists that we reach our goals . " " If we do our work , " he said , " the Ford Foundation has set into motion the per- , petuation of two major cultural institutions and assured them of the continuity of artistic excellence . " The new challenge grants consists of $1.7-million for the ballet and $1.6-million for the opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The matching money must come from private sources , specifically excluding funds in the nature of Federal , state or city governmental support . The foundation will . also provide a cash reserve fund of $1-million for each company to help meet expenses . This money need not be matched but it must be restored , in which case it may be kept by each company . By the time the grants will have expired in 1980 , the opera and the ballet , according to plan , . will have raised a total of $8.6-million in outright gifts of cash or marketable securities in addition to the foundation 's $5.3-million . W. Lowry , vice president of the Ford Foundation 's humanities and arts division , said yesterday , " If the City Center is challenged by these matching rations , the ballet and the opera companies , separately , will have a $1-million cash reserve at the termination of the seven years . " " This gives each a good chance for stability and permanence , " he said . " That 's why we 're willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ballet and the New York City Opera of earned income against the total operating costs is very good , and we 're counting on that continuing . " The grants , as worked out by the City Center and the managements of the two companies in two years of negotiations with the foundation , require that there be no cutback , either financially or artistically . To insure maintenance of standards , it is stipulated that each company 's expenses do not fall below $5-million a year , a sum that they already exceed . The total $6.3-million in Ford benefits is almost evenly divided , with the opera receiving $3.1-million and the ballet , $3.2-million . In the matching , however , the ballet need raise only a little less than $4-million , while the opera is charged with matching ' to the tune of $4.6-million . " The grant helps in two respects , " said Mr Clurman . " It gives us working capital we need for artistic maintenance and the retention of low ticket prices , from ? $2.25 to $9.95 . It also gives us the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've ever had and enables us to do it in such a way that we do it without standing on the brink of disaster . " Wiping Out Liabilities The money will be forthcoming in three categories . First , there will be $3.3-million in new money , much of which will go to wiping out the two groups ' combined liabilities of $2.7-million and covers their operating losses , $519,845 for the ballet and $489,305 for the opera , for the season that ends this month . Second , there is the $1-million of the old grant that need not be repaid provided it is matched doubly . Finally , the foundation will provide $2-million in cash reserves . This is money that can be used as working capital , to help in the cash flow that is often disrupted when expected monies are not available . This money need not be matched , but at the end of the entire grant in 1980 , each company must have a cash reserve of $1-million in hand . If it does , it will not need repay it to the foundation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a " big business , " which is a $15-million a year operation now and will grow to $21-million by 1980 . The grants , he said , make it possible for the center and the two constituents to carry out a reorganization of managements to meet the new requirements of money-raising and associated activities . . The opera company is in its 30th year and the ballet in its 25th . Mr. Clurman stressed that although the City Center had a - higher earned income than most other performingarts groups ? $11-million a year toward the total cost of $15-million to operate  --  the nature of its work makes it impossible to meet operating costs . The opera earns about 68 to 70 per cent of its budget from ticket sales and ' other income , while the ballet does about the same . In addition , the ballet has received $800,000 in a oneyear grant from the New York State Council on the Arts for the year that begins in July , the largest oneyear grant it has ever received . It is understood that the council is making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
