Embattled diplomats and fleeing rulers of the past <P> No matter what the Iranians say , there is ample historical precedent for the U.S. to give sanctuary to the Shah , even on a temporary basis . Largely because of the vagaries of extradition treaties , which vary from country to country , * even the most hated of deposed rulers has usually managed to find a safe haven somewhere in the world . Egypt 's decadent King Farouk luxuriated in Italy after his deposition by the army in 1952 . Argentina 's Dictator Juan Pern was a resident of Spain between 1960 and 1973 , when he returned home to reclaim power . Uganda 's murderous Idi Amin is rumored to be in Libya , while his peer as butcher , ex-Emperor Bokassa I of the Central African Republic , lives in the Ivory Coast . <P> When he entered a Manhattan hospital for medical treatment last month , the Shah joined a large contingent of former heads of state-some honorable , some not-who have sought refuge in the U.S. Alexander Kerensky , Prime Minister of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here after his ouster by the Soviets . So did Venezuelan President Rmulo Betancourt , South Korean Strongman Syngman Rhee , Cambodia 's Marshal Lon Nol and Cuban Dictator Fulgencio Batista . South Viet Nam 's former Premier Nguyen Cao Ky , a resident of California , will be eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship next spring . <P> There is also ample historical precedent , sadly enough , for the Iranian students ' assault on the U.S. embassy in Tehran . Though the inviolability of the diplomatic envoy has been a principle practiced since the Middle Ages , embassies and representatives of governments have frequently been targets for protest . In 1829 a Persian mob-egged on by nationalistic mullahs in the court of the Shah-stormed the Russian embassy in Tehran and massacred almost the entire staff . Xenophobia figured large in the 1900 Boxer Rebellion ( so called because it was led by a group named the Righteous and Harmonious Fists ) , when rebels seeking to wipe out foreign influence in China laid siege to the diplomatic quarter in Peking . The Boxers held the quarter for eight weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city and freed the thousands held hostage . That hostility to foreigners was echoed during the Cultural Revolution in 1967 , when Chairman Mao Tse-tung 's Red Guards burned the British mission , beat up British and Indian diplomats and attacked the fleeing families of Soviet diplomats as they boarded their plane . Mao tacitly approved the assaults . Indonesian officials also applauded the mobs that ransacked the British embassy in Djakarta in 1963.
