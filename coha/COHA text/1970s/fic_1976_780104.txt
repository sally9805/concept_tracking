Calvin Jarrett , forty-one , U.S. citizen , tax attorney , husband , father . Orphaned at the age of eleven . He has caught himself thinking about that lately , thinking of the Evangelical Home for Orphans and Old People , an Hshaped , red brick building on Detroit 's northwest side , where he grew up . Wondering if after all these years it is still in existence . Strange that he has never bothered to check . An odd kind of orphanage : most of the kids had at least one living parent ; some even had two . He had moved there when he was four , leaving the tiny apartment where he was born . his mother sent him gifts on his birthday , and at Christmas . Occasionally she visited him . Periodically she explained why he was living there , and not with her : there was no room for him in the apartment , no money ; it was no neighborhood in which to bring up kids . She had a friend who knew people that were connected with the Home ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Home was 7  | financed by " religious benefactors . " He was named Calvin , for his dead uncle ; Jarrett had been his mother 's maiden name . When she came to see him , she came alone . No one claiming to be his father had ever been in attendance ; he had no memories of being any man 's son . So , if anyone should ask , he can always point out that he had no example to follow . And what is fatherhood anyway ? Talking to a kid about his clothes . Not applying pressure . Looking for signs . He knows what to look for now : loss of appetite , sleeplessness , poor school performance  --  all negative , so far . I ! is son eats , he sleeps , he does his homework . He says he 's happy . Another duty : asking silly questions . Are y ( m happy ? 1 le has to ask , though ; pretends that he is kidding , just kidding ; Conrad replies in kind . Pointless . Would the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thought to ask , before ? Good manners have nothing to do with comnuuiication , he must remember that . And being a father is more than trusting to luck . That , too . Nobody 's role is simple , these days . Not even a kid 's . It used to mean minding your manners , respecting those who were bigger than you , treating each day as a surprise package , waiting to be opened . Not any snore . So what 's changed ? Not enough surprises ? Too many , maybe . He has had a vision all these months , of boys , with their heads next to stereo speakers feeding music into their ears , their long legs draped over chairs and sofas . Or their arms , stretched toward a basketball hoop in the side drive ( he had sunk the posts in cement himself , when Conrad was eight , Jordan , nine ; just after they bought the house ) . Where are all these kids ? Joe Lazenby , Phil Truan , Don Genthe , Dick Van Buren ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is eighteen too old to play touch football on the lawn ? Basketball in  | the side drive ? Is it girls ? Studies ? Since he has been home , Conrad has gone once to the movies . Alone . " Did n't anybody else want to see it ? " Cal had asked . " I do n't know , " he said . " I did n't ask . " Responsibility . That is fatherhood . You can not afford to miss any signs , because that is how it happens : somebody holding too much inside , somebody else missing signs . That doctor in Evanston . Make sure he calls him . It is for his own good . Why ? Because his own vision , that of the boys hanging around , is n't coming true ? It has only been a month . All the other signs seem right . Stay calm . Keep it light . Try not to lean . A balance must be struck between pressure and concern . Back when Conrad was in the hospital , back when the visits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take responsibility for everything : the sections of gray peeling paint in the stair wells ; small gobs of dirt swept into the corners of the steps ; even a scar at the side of one orderly 's mouth . Now that he is home again , things are different . The responsibilities seem enormous . Staggering . His job alone , nobody else 's . Motherhood is different , somehow . And what about fathering girls ? He must ask Ray Hanley sometime , how it feels . Is there more , or less responsibility ? He could n't take more . Your mother wants me to tell you , you have a closetful of decent clothes . He will smile . " Okay . You told me . " But , in a minute , he will ask , " What 's wrong with what I 've got on ? " Nothing . Nothing I can see . Only I do n't pass up any chances to discharge these fatherly duties , this is the age of perfection , kid . Everybody try their emotional and mental and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . All those Saturday trips to the orthodontist , when they were in junior high . Both of his boys had inherited from him , that long , 9  | slightly hooked nose ; from their mother , the small , determined lower jaw . On them it had required thirtyeight hundred dollars ' worth of work , courtesy Peter Bachmann , D.D.S. , M.S. " Hell , what 's a little money ? " he had raved . " Overhaul their whole damn jaws if necessary , this is the age of the perfect mouth ! " But , secretly , he had been proud that he was able to afford such expenses . He was supporting his family , his boys , in style : whatever they needed , whatever they wanted , they got . He had arrived . Ile was here . Not bad for the kid from the Evangelical Home . And now ? Where is he now ? Beth sets breakfast in front of Cal : eggs , bacon , toast , milk , juice . Conrad looks up . " Morning . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . Lazenby 's picking me up at twenty after . " He treats this as a piece of good news . " Great ! " Said too heartily , he sees at once . Conrad looks away , frowning . " I 've got to get dressed , " Beth says . " I tee off at nine . " She hands him his coffee ; crosses to the doorway ; motes of dust flutter nervously in her wake . Conrad is studying . The book is propped against the butter dish . " What is it , a quiz ? " " Book report . " " What book ? " He raises the cover . Cal reads , Jude the Obscure . " How is it ? " " Obscure . " He sips his coffee . " No bacon and eggs this morning ? " He shakes his head . " I only wanted cereal . " He has lost twenty-five pounds in one year . Another  | year before his weight will return to normal , Dr. Crawford predicted . " You feel okay ?

" he asks . Conrad looks up . " What ? " " How 's it going ? School . Swimming . Everything okay ? " " Yeah , fine . Same as yesterday . " " What does that mean ? " A faint smile . " It means you ask me that every day . " " Sorry . " He smiles , too . " I like things neat . " Conrad laughs . He reaches out to flip the book closed . " Okay , " he says , " let 's talk . " " Ca n't help it , " Cal says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table . " " Yeah . " " So , how come Lazenby 's picking you up ? " " He 's a friend of mine . " " I know that .

" " We should have the contract drawn up by the end of the week . " " Okay . " He does a familiar thing , then ; shoves his hands into 11  | the back pockets of his levis as he rocks backward in the chair . Conrad , after all . A good sign , despite the brutal haircut ; the weary look about the eyes . The eyes bother him every day .

" Okay . I just have n't thought about it much . I will , though . " What , no argument ? No raising of the eyebrows , no hint of sarcasm in the reply ?

" I want you to call him anyway , " he says . " Call him today . " " I do n't finish practice until dinner ? " " Call him at school . On your lunch hour . " An obedient boy . Polite . Obedient .

The air is crisp and cool , and he rubs his hands together , shivering in the thin denim jacket . Ile should go back inside ; get a heavier one , but he does n't want to risk it . Not that she will care , or say anything . But the hurdle has been jumped once today . Enough . He glances again at his watch . Almost eight-thirty . Lazenby has forgotten .

He shrugs it off . Something unpleasant . Facing the house , he stares up at his bedroom window . In the early morning , the room is his enemy ; there is danger  | in just being awake . Here , looking up , it is a refuge . He imagines himself safely inside ; in bed , with the covers pulled up . Asleep . Unconscious . The thought surfaces . His father has noticed . Whatever is wrong is now visible . That command : not , " Call the guy , " but , " Call him today . " Worrying . There is something to worry about , as he has suspected .

His grandmother was eager to inform him : " Conrad , if you knew the strain that man was under these past months , the money was nothing , compared with the strain , my heart went out to him , I ca n't tell you . " Then , do n't ! he felt like screaming , squirming to pass through the remark , untouched . He wants to belong to this house again , needs to be part of these tall windows set low to the ground , walls half-hidden behind thick waxy rhododendron leaves , the cedar hedge in front , all of it  --  all elegance and good taste . Good taste is absorbed through the skin , like rays from the sun , in this elegant , tasteful section of Lake Forest , Illinois , a direct quote from a newspaper article .

Relentless , it will soon crush the car like an 16  | eggshell . They cross the Chicago-Northwestern tracks and Stillman is immediately alert , on the lookout . " Hey , there 's Pratt , " he says . " Lemme out . I need a jump . " A small , neat-looking redhead in a blue skirt and tan jacket is hurrying along the street , her books in her arms . " Nice legs , " Lazenby says . " Nice ass .

Just moved in last spring . " " She 's new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stillman sings . Van Buren yawns again . " Christ , you 're a goddamn comedian today , are n't you ? " He remembers this now , about Stillman ; that it is too easy for him . He is too good-looking ; girls have been falling into his lap since junior high , and he has done nothing to earn it , in fact , does not deserve it , spending his time as he does , in tossing off crude remarks about them and then grinning , as if he will be President someday . A diver on the swim team . In general , he has observed that divers tend to be crappy human beings . One of life 's mysteries . " Hey , a tongue twister , " Stillman says . " Jarrett falls for Pratt 's ass . How 's that ? " Lazenby and Van Buren laugh . The remark has an indelible quality that makes Conrad 's skin prickle . Stillman is an expert at that : he and Buck had phrases that would sing in the locker room for weeks . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to slip over it , a blur of gold leaves and green grass sliding , sliding as they turn into the parking lot behind the school . 17  | Jarrett falls for Pratt 's ass , ' yeah , I like it .

He needs no more enemies . He forces a laugh from the back of his throat ; turns his attention outside the window Forget it forget it he was never a friend sends him a mental message Screw you he will not get it does not operate on the same frequency never will so fuck it .

" The guy was a jerk , " somebody says . " All hung up on what was the moral thing to do . It did n't make any sense . " " That 's too easy , Joel .

" " Yeah , what ? " " Yeah , you asked me before , " he says . " Yeah , they did . " Salan shakes his head ; clicks his tongue in disapproval . " I do n't know , " he says . " I 'm no doctor , but I do n't think I 'd let their mess around with my head like that .

In the car on the way home , Lazenby says , " Salan 's a damn , picky bastard . He drives me nuts . " " Everything drives you nuts , " Stillman says . " The day is not complete without Lazenby telling everybody what a fucked-up state the world 's in , right ? " He turns around . " What d' you think , Jarrett ? Danoff and Edge look pretty good , huh ? " Danoff and Edge are sophomores . They swim the free style . They have beaten him in practice every day for two weeks .

Silent and empty . He hangs his jacket carefully in the front closet and goes upstairs to his room . He sets his books down on his desk and stands , looking out the window from his tower of safety . Idly , he opens the desk drawer , sifting through a pile of papers : old stuff , schedules , letters , scraps of notes written long ago . Funny she has never cleaned out this drawer . He should do it , maybe sometime he will . Fingers ruffling , touching suddenly the glossy and slick surface of a photograph . He pulls it out looking quickly 23  | along the bottom of it in white letters FIRST PLACE MEDLEY RELAY TEAM . Lazenby . Buck . Himself in the middle .

His stomach tightens , as if to ward off a blow . 24  | The restaurant is dark ; it has a heavy Mediterranean decor that Cal finds oppressive . It is not the kind of place he normally frequents . There is a lawyers ' hangout , the Quik-Lunch , around the corner from the Plaza , but that would not suit Beth . This place is better for her . She had called him this morning ; asked him to meet her here , her voice light , full of excitement and Good News . Well , great , we can all use some of that , ca n't we ? And she looks like good news , seated across from him in a sleeveless knit suit , the color of straw , a V-neck bordered in orange , a thin gold chain around her neck . All elegance and self-possession . So beautiful in every detail that men and women both like to look at her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , walking humbly and proudly behind her , a modest smile on his lips , Yes , it 's true , twenty-one years next spring we have been married . He grins at the bartender , the envious customers . His description is accu- rate . Self-possessed is what she is ; he emphatically does not own her , nor does he have control over her , nor can he understand or even predict with reliability her moods , her attitudes . She is a marvelous mystery to him ; as complex , as interesting as she appeared to him on that first day he met her some twenty-two years ago on the tennis courts at the Beverly Racquet Club . Ray 's father had a membership , and he was with Ray that day , working off the tensions of a hideous law exam . She was a good tennis player even then . She liked to play with men because the competition was better , she had told Ray , approaching hint first . She had a friend who was good , also . Would they like to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities into it ; who cared if she could play at all 's But she was good , and her friend was good , and the friend and Cal beat Beth and Ray easily , and afterward , he was never sure how it was arranged , Beth and Cal were paired off together , and Ray got the friend . They went out to dinner at the Chatterbox Cafe . Cod , what a storehouse of trivia he kept up there . The Chatterbox Cafe . It was an evening of unprecedented events . He had had a date with someone else that night . Midway through dinner he had excused himself , gone to the telephone , broken the date . He never had another with any girl except Beth . " I was afraid if I had left early , " he confessed to her later , " I would n't have made enough of an impression , and you would n't see me again . " " I was afraid , too , " she said . " I thought you might be engaged or married and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , getting you away from her . I knew when you aced Ray on that first serve I was going to marry you and that was all there was to it . " Ile laughs out loud , thinking about it , and Beth , sipping her drink , snaps her fingers at him . 26  | " Where are you ? " " Nowhere . Right here . Just thinking . What have you got there ? " She has pulled an envelope from her purse , and the folded sheets of slick paper are suddenly before him : Athens , Rome , London , Dubrovnik . " They said it 's late , but there are still openings . If we can let them know immediately . " " Let them know what ? " " I remember last year you said Yugoslavia , but , Cal , do n't you think London would be fun ? Like something out of Dickens . We 've never done that . Christmas in London ? " " Listen , " he says , " I do n't think we should plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at him over the rim of her glass . " We go away for Christmas every year . " Carefully he folds the sheets ; places them in the center of the table . " I know . But not this year . The timing just is n't right . " " The timing is n't right , " she says . " What does that mean ? " " You know , what it means . " " Yes . " She turns her head slightly away from him . Wearing her hair differently today ; the sharp white line of her part at the side , wings of hair swept back and clipped at the top of her head . " Well . They said it would be better to leave in the middle of ' December and book a flight back after the first week in January . " " We ca n't go in the middle of December . He 'd have to miss a week of school . And another week in January would be two weeks ? " " He could meet us there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Mother and Dad would ? " " No ! " 27  | They sit in silence for a moment . " I think you 're wrong , Cal , " she says . " I think it would be good for us all to go . " " No . Just  --  no . " The waiter appears with the menus . " Never mind , " she says , " I know what I want . The fish chowder and a green salad , Italian dressing . And some of your special bread . Coffee , too , please . " Cal orders a roast-beef sandwich and coffee . Leaning back in the chair , he tries to make out the dimensions of the room ; he imagines it iii the harsh , full light of day . Square and ugly . Better to keel ) it dark . " Why do n't you ask him if he wants to go ? I think he will . Why would n't he ? " . " I think , " he says , " that was our mistake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done that ? " It would n't have made any difference , you know that . Dr. Brandt told us ? " " Dr. Brandt told us he was depressed . Dr. Brandt is a G.P. What the hell did he know ? " He sets his glass down , rapping it smartly against the table . He has n't meant to . The sound is loud and it makes her jump . " Are you blaming him , now ? He gave him the physical , just as you asked . What more was he supposed to do ? " " I 'm not blaming Brandt . I 'm not blaming anyone . It was n't anyone 's fault , I know that . " " You do n't believe that , " she says . " You say it , but you do n't believe it . " " I believe it , " he says . " I 'm not even talking about blame , I 'm talking about being available . We were busy down there . Every goddamned minute . There was n't time to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think would  | have been said ? Do you even think he knew at that point ? And , if he did know , do you think he would have told us ? " " I do n't know . " She shakes her head . " I do n't think he would have told us . " The waiter brings their lunches , and they sit , silently , watching him serve . When he leaves the table , she looks down at her lap . " I do n't think it 's a good idea for us to blame ourselves for what happened , Cal . " " Fine , " he says curtly . " Do n't , then . If that means a damn thing . " Her head sinks lower . She busies herself , buttering the piece of bread in her hand . " Beth , " he says , " I 'm sorry , honey . I 'm sorry . " She looks up . " What 's the matter ? " she whispers . " Is something the matter ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , why ca n't we go ? " She leans toward him . " You know how good it feels to get away . All the wonderful places we 've been , Spain , Portugal , Hawaii  --  I know it 's a lot to ask , Cal , I know we have expenses ? " " It 's not the money . " " ? but I need it ! I need to go ! I need you to go with me . " " I want to go with you , " he says . " We can go in the spring , maybe , any place you want . " She sits back , then , hands in her lap . " No . " Her voice is flat . " If we do n't go now , we wo n't go in the spring , either . " " That 's silly , " he says . " We will . I just think that now we should  --  this time we might try handling things differently . " 29  | " This time ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he should n't drink at lunch , should n't have had two martinis , he is keyed up , now ; nervous . This afternoon he will sit at his desk in a half-stupor , surrounded by a confusion of papers . " Then , are we going to live like this ? With it always hanging over our heads ? " There is a determined set to her chin that moves him , even when she uses it against him , even when it seems irrational and dangerous , accompanied by ideas he does not agree with . Thus , as she argued stubbornly with Ray over dinner that night that the Michigan Daily had no right to meddle in the financial affairs of campus sororities ( her stand was based on rights of privacy , as he remembered it ) , he had fallen abruptly and thoroughly in love with her . It was , on looking back , as good a reason as a tennis ace . " Nothing is hanging over our heads , " he says , as much to himself as to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She looks at him , reaching out to gather the colored sheets of paper into a neat pile , slipping them into the envelope . " Then , I do n't understand you at all , " she says . He sits at his desk , working on the papers Ray has left there for him . At three-thirty he has a meeting with Sandlin . They will discuss a new angle on their annuities . A germ , Ray calls it . His ideas are always referred to as " germs " ; his figure estimates are " in the ball park . " Cliches . They jump out at you from everywhere , but you never see your own . Howard called again today , to talk about the Mercedes dealership opening up  | in Evanston . " Things are looking up , Cal . Light at the end of the tunnel . People buying expensive foreign cars again . Hell of a good sign , would n't you say ? " Yes , he had agreed with this spot analysis of U.S. economy , his mind automatically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woods ? It was missing today . He gets up to stretch and look out the window at the North Shore Channel ; the fringes of Northwestern 's campus ; down below , Evanston proper . The offices of Hanley and Jarrett , Attorneys at Law , on the eighth floor of the State National Bank Plaza , overlook the whole of southwest Evanston . He has always wished they were on the eastern side of the building , preferring to look out on frozen cliffs of water in winter , rather than dirty streets , dirtier cars ; it is not a pleasant corner in the midst of the gray Chicago winter . Other than that , it is a good location . The atmosphere on the eighth floor seems cleaner ; steadier . Years ago , when they were getting started , their one-room Chicago office was hot and crowded ; their look-alike , cramped apartments on the near north side were hotter and more crowded , yet . No more . Now Ray and Nancy live in Glencoe , and he takes the train in from his English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He tells Cal he is crazy to drive . The train is the only way , he says . But Cal prefers his car . It gives him control over his schedule , and , besides , riding the train has always made him nervous . He ca n't work , as he has seen some men do ; he can barely read the paper . Riding the train gives him too much time to think , he has decided . Too much thinking can ruin you . Ray knocks on the open door ; sticks his head inside . " Got a minute to run this around before the meeting ? " " Sure . C'm on in. " 31  | " I just want to clue you in about Sandlin . Christ , I tell him twice a week he ought to go to law school . He thinks I 'm kidding . I swear , he thinks he 's the only account we have . " " You got the annuities straightened out ? " " Yeah , I think so . Have a look . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternative tax consequences he has assembled , while Cal scans the stack of letters from G. Sandlin Corp. , dating back over the past months . " Looks okay to me . What 's his problem ? " No problem , really . Ile fancies himself this big wheeler dealer and it frosts hell out of him that his transactions are not unique , that they have actually been performed maw , . times before in the history of tax law . " " So what are we seeing him for ? " " Hell , I do n't know  --  so he can tell his partners at lunch that he pointed out a few loopholes to those hotshot lawyers up on eight . Do me a favor , will you ? Get him to stop calling every day . You 're good at that . Closing doors politely . If I tell him , he 's going to get offended , but it 's the goddamn , pathetic truth , if I had a buck for every time he calls me about junk , just niggling items , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , listen , we can hold off on the Naylor account . I heard from them today . No tax court until January . " " Great . " Ray sits back , puts his feet up on Cal 's desk . " Beth looks terrific , " he says . " God , she 's tan . Must be playing a lot of golf , huh ? " " Yeah , she is . " " You two have a nice lunch ? " " Yeah , fine . "  | " Hey , we ought to have lunch sometime , partner . How about tomorrow ? " " Sure . I 'll meet you at the Quik-Lunch about eleventhirty . How 's that ? " Ray laughs . " I meant you ought to take me to lunch . " " I know what you meant . " " Say , I heard you on the phone with Howard . Is Connie swimming this year ? " " Yeah , he is . " " You think that 's a good idea ? I mean , letting him get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if it were my kid ? " They look at each other , and Ray says , " Forget it . That was stupid . Forget it . " " No , that 's okay , " Cal says . " It was n't my idea , anyway . He set it up himself , went in to talk to the coach about it . I did n't even know until he came home and said it was done . " He wants to ask , What the hell do you know about it , you with your two girls , one nineteen , away at college and everything roses , and how old is the other one ? Seven ? What is that , second grade ? What do you know ? But he does n't . And he ca n't stay angry at Ray , who has been his friend since law school , nor at Iioward , either ; the concerned grandfather , the concerned father-inlaw . All who are concerned only want to help . Well , who can help ? Severe Depressive Episodes : High @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers he signed last January . A sevenword diagnosis . Is there a seven-word cure ? Is he cured ? " Listen , " Ray says , " I 'll give you a couple of minutes to finish up . " " Okay . " He pushes the papers around until Ray has left , then reaches into the bottom drawer of his desk for 33  | the Evanston telephone directory : Tyrone C. Berger , M.D. 651 Sherman Ave . So . Near the railroad station . Not the hottest of neighborhoods , but close to the Plaza . He can walk over to the office when he 's through . They can ride home together . He had told Cal last night that he made an appointment . A good boy . Obedient . He does what he is told to do . Another duty of fatherhood . Checking up . Signing commitment papers , and other papers , authorizing certain specified treatments . Protecting yourself from further grief , from any more facts of history that do not change ; that can not be changed . Like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the one who never worried , who believed they would all live forever . Two sons , Jordan and Conrad , born fourteen months apart . One now deceased . Another word from the commitment papers . Part of the background information he was required to furnish . Deceased . Too formal a word to have any meaning . A symbol without impression , without power to hurt , or to heal . She was right . He lied to her at lunch . He does not believe himself to be innocent . It has to be his fault , because fault equals responsibility equals control equals eventual understanding . How things happened . Why they happened . So where is the fault ? Is it in believing that the people you love are immortal ? Untouchable ? No , everyone believes that . Only no one knows it 's what he believes  --  until it happens . Then comes the rage , the banging about the walls , crying what if , what if . Everyone is always so damned surprised , that is the horror of it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , but merely held over for future discussion . Well , why not  | go ? What difference will it make ? If she 's right , and it made no difference , last year was nobody 's fault  --  nobody 's fault . That is the truth . That is what makes it all so impossible to understand . 35  | The building is shabby , and inside , the lobby is hot and dark . He glances at his watch ; too dark in here to make out the numbers . The crisp and sunny day he has left outside has nearly blinded him . A directory on the far wall ; he goes to it ; scans the list of names . Eleven in all ; seven with M.D. after them . The top name on the list is the one he is looking for : T. C. BERGER M.D. 202 . Would any of these guys be of use in an emergency ? All specialists  --  podiatrists , optometrists , psychiatrists ? but what if an accident were to happen in front of the building ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for muggings . Glancing at his watch again , he finds his eyes have adjusted to the dim light . Four o'clock . Exactly . Well then get on it no backing out now an idea he has toyed with all week not going just not showing up wo n't work . He is to meet his father at his office at five-fifteen . " Do n't be late . I 've got a meeting tonight . I 'd like to get out of there as close to five as I can . " Translated : " Do n't  | let the guy upset you , show up when you 're supposed to , it only takes ten minutes to walk from Sherman and Tenth to the Plaza , I have clocked it . " No . Not fair . Not necessary to take everything so personally . He probably does have a meeting tonight . Everything 's all right , everything 's fine , keep it that way . On an even keel , as his grandfather would say . Stuck between the directory and the wall is a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ okay ? Jesus C. The edges of it are furred ; curved slightly inward . As if it has been there a long time . He shakes his head , making for the staircase ; forces a growl from the back of his throat . He is being strangled . In the narrow hallway on the second floor , a single light bulb burns , helpless against the invading gloom . High , old-fashioned doors , with windows of bubbled glass in them ; all dark on both sides of the hall , and looking as if they have n't been used for years . Any people in this building ? Is this an emergency ? Even a podiatrist would do . Panic begins to settle in around him . At the end of the hall is a doorway with light behind it . He goes to it . The letters , stuck to the opaque glass with adhesive backing , spell out T C I3IE:RGER M D. They slant upward , crooked rectangles , like a kid would print them on unlined paper . He pushes experimentally at the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even when he turns the knob , it does n't give . I Ie pushes harder this time , and it opens . He steps in-37  | side . The door closes sharply behind him . He is in an entry , empty of people , longer than it is deep , with a chair in it , a floor lamp , a small table strewn with magazines , a green metal wastebasket . Barely furnished , the room still seems cluttered . Opposite him is a doorway ; an overturned chair blocks it . From inside the other room mysterious , shuffling sounds are issuing . A scene of total disorder confronts him as he moves toward the door . Books , magazines , loose piles of paper are everywhere ; empty plastic cups , pieces of clothing , a cardboard box , THE BAKERY lettered in script on its lid , all tossed together in the middle of the floor . Several ashtrays are dumped , upside clown , on the rug . A gooseneck lamp lies , like a dead snake , beside t hem . I n @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over , his back to the doorway . As Conrad approaches , he turns . About him there is the look of a crafty monkey ; dark skin , dark crinkly hair sprouting in tufts about his face , a body that hunches forward , an elongated question mark . " Wait , " he says , " do n't tell me . Jarrett . " The eyes , a compelling and vivid blue , beam into whatever they touch . They touch Conrad 's face now , and the effect is that of being in an intense blue spotlight . He snaps his fingers . " Yeah . You look like somebody Crawford would send me . Somebody who 's a match for my daring wit and inquiring mind . " Conrad , cool and polite , asks , " Am I seeing you ? Or are you seeing me ? " He laughs , delighted . " That ought a be easy . This my office , or yours ? No . No good . Lotsa guys in this business make house calls now . Let 's see your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rummaging fiercely for a minute ; he comes up with a gray stenographer 's 38  | notebook . " Here . Tuesday , four o'clock . Conrad Jarrett . Ah . I knew it . " He grins , then . Conrad is not easily charmed . Or fooled . Eccentricity . A favorite put-on of psychiatrists . Ile does not trust them . Too many oddballs floating around the hospital . Only Crawford had behaved as if he knew what he was doing . He bends to pick up the overturned chair . " Bring that over here , " Berger directs him . " Sit down . " He continues to prowl around the room , lifting books , setting them aside , retrieving papers from the floor , stacking up empty plastic cups . On further examination , he resembles a compact , slightly undersize gorilla . Conrad can not take his eyes off him . " I think I was ripped off this afternoon , " he says . " Or else the cleaning lady did one hell of a job on me . Place did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after drugs , I guess . What a neighborhood . Nothing but placebos here . Use ' em myself for quick energy sometimes . Just sugar . " He smiles , arms raised , palms turned up in an attitude of perplexity . " You were robbed ? " " Looks like . " " You going to call somebody ? " " Who ? You mean cops ? " I le shrugs . " What 's missing ? Maybe nothing . Maybe they even left something , who knows ? " He moves to the small sink , half-hidden in the corner behind a huge pile of books . " You want some coffee ? Listen , do me a favor , look on the desk there , see if you can find a data sheet  --  you know , name , age , date of birth , et cetera  --  fill it out for me , will you ? Got ta keep records , the state says . Rules . " He sighs . " Now what am I supposed to do with those poor bastards lying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39  | overturned filing cabinet , its contents scattered . " Did you say yes or no ? " " What ? " " Coffee . Yes or no ? Sit down , sit down . " " No . Thanks . " Obediently he goes to the desk ; searches through the papers on top of it until he comes up with a blank information card . He begins to fill it out . Berger empties the other chair of debris and drags it over to the desk . " How long since you left the hospital ? " " A month and a half . " " Feeling depressed ? ' " " No " " Onstage ? " " Pat don ? " " People ner oils ? ' Treat you like you 're a dangerous man ? " He shrugs . " Yeah , a little , I guess . " " And are your " " I do n't know . " Berger grins , then . " You look sensible enough to me . At least , you looked sensibly disgusted when you walked in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? The second time this year . What do you think I ought a do about it ? " He is used to this technique ; he looks for psychological design in the question . No . Too farfetched . Nobody would go to this much trouble just to set up a test for him . He says , " I guess I 'd just clean it up and forget about it . " " Yeah , you 're right . Christ , what a gigantic pain in the tail though , huh ? " The man sits back , fingers curved : wound his coffee cup , watching as Conrad finishes Idling out the card . " Sure you do n't want any coffee ? I 've got clean cups around here somewhere . " 40  | Conrad shakes his head ; hands him the card . He reads it quickly . " Good , strong print . Neat . Like an engineer . So . What 're you doing here ? You look like a healthy kid to me . " " What I 'm doing here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come . Berger nods . " Uh huh . Rules again . Authority reigns . " He tosses the card onto the desk . " So , suppose you did n't have to come . What would you be here for ? " " I would n't . " He finds himself firmly enveloped in the piercing blue gaze ; shifts uncomfortably in the chair . " How long were you there ? " " Eight months . " " What did you do ? O.D. ? Make too much noise in the library ? " " No . " Looks steadily at the bookcase in front of him ; floor-to-ceiling , jammed with books . " I tried to off myself . " Berger picks up the card again ; studies it as he blows on his coffee . " What with ? Pills ? Gillette Super-Blue ? " He sees the way to handle this guy . Keep it light . A joker . Slide out from under without damage . " It was a Platinum-Plus , " he says . The eyes are fixed upon hint thoughtfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel to be home ? Everybody glad to see you ? " " Yes . Sure . " " Your friends , everything okay with them ? " " Fine . " " It says here , no sisters , no brothers . Right ? " " Right , " he says . Do n't squirm do n't panic release is inevitable . Soon soon . Berger leans back in the chair , hands behind his head . It is hard to figure his age . He could be twenty-41  | five . He could be forty . " So , what d' you want to work on ? " he asks . " Pardon ? " " Well , you 're here . It 's your money , so to speak . What d' you want to change ? " He thinks , then , of his father ; of their struggle to keep between them a screen of calm and order . " I 'd like to be more in control , I guess . So people can quit worrying about me . " " So , who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is his idea . " " I low about your mother ? Is n't she worried ? " " No . " " I low come ? " " She 's ? I do n't know , she 's not a worrier . " " No ? What sloes she do , then ? " " Do ? " " Yeah , what 's her general policy toward you ? You get along with her all right ? " - " Yeah , fine . " Ile is abruptly uncomfortable . An endless grilling process , like it was in the hospital . He forgot how it tightened him up ; how much he used to hate it . " You 've got a funny look on your face , " Berger says . " What 're you thinking ? " " I 'm thinking , " he says , " if you 're a friend of Crawford 's you 're probably okay , but I do n't like this already . Look , what do you know about me ? Have you talked to Crawford ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smile is benign . " He told me your name , that 's all . Told me to look for you . " " Okay , I 'll tell you some things . " He turns his head slightly , taking in the narrow window at the left of the bookcase . Sunlight streams in from the slot , cutting a bright path across the carpeting . " I had a brother . He 's 42  | dead . It was an accident on the lake . We were sailing . He drowned . " " When ? " " Summer before last . " Staring now at the bookcase , he tries to make out the titles of the books from where he is sitting . He can not . They are too far away . " I suppose you and Crawford talked about it , " Berger says . " Every day . " " And you do n't like to talk about it . " He shrugs . " It does n't change anything . " A pigeon , dull-gray , lights on the cement window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ; then flies off . " Okay , " Berger says . " Anything else ? " " No , " he says . " Yeah . About friends . I do n't have any . I got sort of out of touch before I left . " " Oh ? " He does not respond to this technique ; the comment in the form of a question . He had cured Crawford of it by telling him it was impossible to concentrate on what person was saying if you were listening for his voice to go up at the end of the sentence . " Well , okay , " Berger says . " I 'd better tell you . I 'm not big on control . I prefer things fluid . In motion . But it 's your money . " " So to speak . " " So to speak , yeah . " Berger laughs , reaching for his notebook . " How 's Tuesdays and Fridays ? " " Twice a week ? " He shrugs . " Control is a tough nut . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hmm . That 's a problem . So , how do we solve it ? " A long , uncomfortable silence . He is tired and ir-43  | ritated . And again , there are no choices ; it only looks as if there are . " I guess I skip practice and come here twice a week , " he says . " Okeydoke . " It is over , and Berger walks him to the door . " The schedule , " he says , " is based on patient ratings . A scale of one to ten . The higher I rate , the fewer times you got ta come . Example : You rate me ten , you only have to see me once a week . " Conrad laughs . " ' That 's crazy . " " Hey , I 'm the doctor . " Berger grins at him . " You 're the patient . " The worst , the first session has been gotten through . And the guy is not had ; at least he is loose . The exchange about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital ; nobody hid anything there . People kidded you about all kinds of stuff and it was all right ; it even helped to stay the flood of shame and guilt . Remembering that day at lunch when Stan Carmichael rose from his chair pointing his finger in stern accusation : " Profane and unholy boy ! Sinner against God and Man , father and mother ? " Robbie prompted him " ? and the Holy Ghost , Stan ? " and he ranted on " ? and the Holy Ghost ! Fall on your knees ! Repent of evil ! Ask forgiveness for your profane and evil ways , Conrad Keith Jarrett ! " and he had nodded , eating on , while Robbie leaned across the table , and asked , " Stan , may I have your gingerbread ? Just if you 're not going to eat it , buddy . " And Stan broke off his ravings to snarl petulantly , " Goddamn it , Rob , you 're a leech , you scrounge off my plate at every meal , it 's disgusting ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when nobody mentions anything , when everybody is careful not to mention it ? Ah , shit , Jarrett , what do you want ? Want people to say , " Gee , we 're glad you did n't die ? " Poor taste , poor taste . He is suddenly aware of the other people on the street , hurrying by , intent upon their business . See ? No one 's accusing . They do n't even seem repelled . As a matter of fact , they do n't even notice . So . No need to be affected by them , either , right ? Still , as they pass him , he carefully averts his gaze . 45  | Cherry comes in , coatless , breathless , late from her lunch hour again . She gives Cal the practiced , wideeyed smile . " What are you looking for , Mr. Jarrett ? If it 's Braddock , that 's on Mr. Hanley 's desk . I 'll get it for you. , , " That 's all right . " He nods curtly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other day . " " Oh , just a sec , I know right where that is . I 'll bring it in to you , okay ? " And again , the smile . A tall , big-boned girl who wears too much make-up , and her skirts too short . He has noticed lately that women are n't wearing their skirts short . It must be out of style again , and now it looks cheap . Or else he is getting old . And the secretaries get younger every year . Cherry is nineteen . Lord , was he ever that young ? Cherry . Now , who the hell would give a daughter that silly name ? Nobody would . It 's a fake , like the smile . He goes into his office and stands at the window , waiting for the file , staring out at the flat , red- brick complex of buildings to the west . Evanston Township High School . Strange how institutional buildings resemble one another . He can spot them a mile off . That one looks much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wednesday , November fifth . Get with Ray this afternoon about Braddock . Call George Sandlin 's broker . Call Burns and Rousch , set up a meeting for the nineteenth . Duties , services , advice . A good thing you do not have to know who you are , Jarrett , in order to perform , because today there is a minimum of information available on that subject . He hates fighting , and last night they had fought ? over London . " I think you 're being unreasonable , " she said , " not even daring to ask him about it . Why do n't you just admit that it 's you who does n't want to go ? " " You ask him , then ! What am I ? The official interpreter here ? You see him every day , do n't you ? Show him the travel folders , give him the pitch . " " I do n't see him any more than you do , " she said coolly . " What are you afraid of ? It 's a question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly ask him enough other questions  --  How did he sleep ? I low does he feel ? How did I sleep ? How do I feel ? " " Okay , " he said . " flow ( lid you sleep ? How do you feel ? " " That 's not it ! " she said . " If we could all just relax a little ! If things could just be normal again . I do n't want you to start asking me the questions , I want you to just stop ! " Well , okay . Fair enough . If she knew , though , that it is not only of Conrad but of himself that he is asking questions now ; basic , hopeless questions that mock him , 47 : Y : x - a+ ANS. ,  | finger him as a joker , a bumbler , a poor dope . Who the hell are you ? as he walks down the street , and who can step in time to that music for more than thirty seconds ? He ducks into a drugstore for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you ? follows him inside , leaning on the glass counter , waiting . Maybe everybody does it , that is the thought he hangs on to , like a drunk at a friendly lamppost . Who in the world knows who he is all the time ? It is not a question to ask a guy over a sandwich at the Quik-Lunch . If you must ponder it , then do it alone at isolated periods with long intervals in between , so as not to drive yourself bats . I 'm flu ' kind of man who ? he has heard this phrase a million times , at parties , iii bars , in the course of norival conversation , I 'm 1/u ' kind of man who  --  instinctively he listens ; tries to apply any familiar terms to himself , but without success . Arnold Bacon . There was a man who knew who he was . Years since he has thought about him . In 1967 , Ray noticed his obit in the Tribune " . . . nationally known tax attorney dies at seventy-two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ABA president says .... " He was seventeen years old when he first met Arnold Bacon . Seventeen , a senior in high school , his plans for the future not extending past the next afternoon , and Bacon had come up to him at , of all places , a Christmas Tea in the lounge of the Evangelical Home . " Well , young man , what are you planning to do with the rest of your life ? " He had laughed politely , looking for a neat and pleasant exit to the conversation , but Bacon was serious . " I 've looked at your grades , " he said . " You 're smart . You know the importance of a good education . You ever thought about going into law ? " Ile had thought about being a Soldier of Fortune , after reading The Three Musketeers . Or a fireman . A 48  | professional athlete . He was a good tennis player , he was well coordinated . He learned games quickly . Those vague and wistful occupations faded out of the picture after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . He applied and was accepted to prelaw at Wayne University ; he took a part-time job clerking in Bacon 's office ; he graduated from Wayne and was accepted into law school at the University of Michigan , backed by Bacon 's influential recommendation , he later found out from one of the deans . A lucky accident . Bacon took him on ; decided to be his mentor ; told him what courses to take and which ones to stay away from ; which scholarships to apply for ; which professors he must not miss . He came to his aid financially whenever it was necessary . It was the closest thing to a father-son relationship  --  it was a father-son relationship , he thought . Bacon had one daughter ; no sons . Bacon 's daughter might have made a smashing lawyer ; but women lawyers were rarer , then , and suspect . And he had this reverence , this vast , eclipsing love for the law that had to be coalesced . He needed a student , an apprentice . Ile needed to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not approved of ' law students who married while they were in school . Diffusion of energy , he called it . And so , of course , everything had changed , after Beth . Bacon was a man of strong views . Ile had principles . Integrity . Ile knew who he was and where he stood on certain  --  what he considered  --  inviolable issues . Bacon had been Cal 's first actual experience with loss . When he was eleven , he learned the association of that word with death . The director of the Evangelical I tome had called him in to tell him of his " loss . " His mother had " passed away " ? another term he was more 49  | familiar with , having heard it used frequently in connection with the elderly , wraithlike beings who inhabited the east wing of the Home , coming and going very quickly . He remembered the feeling of awe that possessed him that day . He was aware that an event of some magnitude had happened to him . Someone close to him had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . For a short time he became a figure of some importance to his peers . And he was invited to the director 's office for cocoa and sermons on Love and Loss , and How a Christian Deals with Grief . The only difference he perceived was that he no longer had any visitor or presents on his birthday , or at Christmas . Well , that was n't true , really . I le had presents , t hey just were n't from anyone he knew . But he did not , at the time , understand the meaning of loss . And of grief . Ile still had not experienced those words at all . IIe had grieved over Arnold , though . Not when he died , it was too late , then ; years since he had seen him . But when he discovered that it had been a business venture , after all , that had felt like grief . It was grief . He and Beth had , together , repaid the money . It was , as Bacon pointed out to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was not a hardship . Beth had her own money ; he had a good scholarship , and they hardly felt the monthly bill . But Arnold 's indifference , after the marriage  --  that had hurt him so much . It had undermined him , taken away something that he had n't even realized he possessed ; he had regarded it so lightly , so casually . Cherry swings into the room with her smile , to put the papers on his desk . Seductively , that is how she does it . She works hard at it . Too hard . She has a good telephone voice . That 's about it . Ca n't take dictation worth a damn , and she wo n't file . He wonders where she 50  | found this one ; she must have had to do some hunting for it . Her boy friend goes to Northwestern , gets out of class at five o'clock each day , she has informed them . She is firm about leaving the office at exactly that time . Her habit of sneaking error-spotted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gives him the look of wide-eyed innocence , drives him crazy . What would Bacon have to say about a secretary like this ? " Calvin , you get what you deserve . " I 'm the kind of man who  --  has n't the least idea what kind of man I am . There . Some definition . He is no closer than he was back in the director 's office , back when he listened to the sermons , his mind wandering , not even aware , then , that he was searching . So , how does a Christian deal with grief ? There is no dealing ; he knows that much . There is simply the stubborn , mindless hanging on until it is over . Until you are through it . But something has happened in the process . The old definitions , the neat , knowing pigeonholes have disappeared . Or else they no longer apply . His eyes move again to the calendar . Wednesday , November fifth . Of course . Obvious . All the painful selfexamination ; the unanswered questions . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jordan 's birthday . Today he would have been nineteen . 51  | Karen sniffles at him . I ) eels dimples in her cheeks . He had forgotten that about her , had forgotten how she lowers her head when she is embarrassed or nervous . Nervous now as she sits down across from him in the narrow booth . It makes him feel protective . She does n't have to be afraid of him . " Hi . How are you ? " " Fine . And you ? " He grins ; shrugs his shoulders . " Not bad . Light , scattered paranoia increasing to moderate during the day . " Ile means merely to jog her memory , but she frowns and looks away . He has offended her . " Hey , I 'm only kidding . I 'm fine . Really . " She leans awkwardly to the side , shrugging out of her coat ; folds it neatly beside her on the seat . She has gained weight since the hospital . It looks good on her . She used to wear her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ears while she talked . Now it is short ,  | curling softly about her face . Dark feathers that brush against her cheeks . " I like your hair that way . " " Thank you . " She touches it . She touches and straightens her coat again . They look at each other . Slowly sinking in the awkwardness of the moment . He did n't want that to happen . They were good friends at the hospital . They still are . No reason to be uncomfortable , is there ? She asks , " When did you come home ? " " End of August . " A place where they were both safe . They talked for hours on the stone bench outside the rec-room door . Sometimes Leo would come and sit with them , cracking jokes , finding out they were alive . Surely she must remember . " It 's great to see you , " he says . " Good to see you . " Again she ducks her head . " I ca n't stay too long . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is doing A Thousand Clowns  --  the Herb Gardner play  --  do you know it ? We 're going wild trying to get it together . I 'm secretary this year , that 's probably why we 're so disorganized ? " He says bluntly , " Well , do n't let inc uhold you up , then . " All that time to get here so he can have a Coke in this drugstore because it is near her house in Skokie , and she sits there as if she is being held prisoner . What a stupid idea . Sorry he thought of it , sorry he called her at all . " I came because you asked to , " she says quietly . And sorry again for being rude , and for exposing himself and his goddamn needs again . Jarrett when will you grow up ? " You kids gon na order or what ? " 53  | The counterman doubles as the waiter when things are slow , as they are on this Saturday morning . He eyes them with hostile boredom . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just black coffee for me . " Karen gives him a pleasant smile . Nothing doing . He scribbles off a bill and slaps it down on the table with a grunt of annoyance . Not the type to be won over so easily . Have to come up with something better . A million-dollar order , maybe . Conrad pulls his eyebrows together , mocking him , and Karen giggles . She bites her lip , looking down at the table . " There , that 's better . I le says , " I 'm sorry . I did n't mean that . " Its okay . I did n't mean to sound so rah-rah , either . And I really ( 1ic1 want to see you . Only I was sort of afraid . You seemed so clown , over the phone . " " I'III not down , " he says quickly . " I ley , everything 's going great . I 'm hack in school , I'in swimming ? " " Oh , really ' ? I'in glad . " " Well , we have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bench all year . " " Oh , no , you 'll do fine , I 'm sure . " The man returns . He is small and undernourishedlooking . Sour . In silence , Conrad slides out of the booth to pay him . He looks at the coins suspiciously ; turns away without a word . Conrad shakes his head . " Hostile . " She giggles . " Definitely a low-self-image day . " And they relax . She , the seasoned veteran , out six months to his three , asks , " Are you seeing anybody ? " " A doctor ? Yeah , are you ? " She shakes her head and , obscurely , he feels ashamed . Another black mark against him . " Dr. Crawford gave me a name , " she says , " and I went for a while , but then I finally decided it was n't 54  | doing me any good . I mean , he was n't telling me anything I could n't figure out for myself . Really , the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God . " She stops , but it is only to take a breath . " Anyway , that 's what Dad says , and I know he 's right . It 's what they told us in the hospital , too , did n't they ? That you have to learn to help yourself , and this guy was over in Elk Grove Village and expensive as hell . " She looks at him and smiles . " That is n't why I stopped going , though . And I do n't mean that there is n't any value in it , if you need it . I mean , for some people it could be just the right thing ? " She looks to him for help , afraid that she has wounded him . To reassure her , he says , " Well , I do n't know how long I 'll keep it up , either . I got shoved into it , sort of . My father  --  I do n't think he 's got that much confidence in me . He 's pretty nervous about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind flushed out . After an hour with this guy , you 're not too sure about him , but you know you 're okay . " Berger , and his visits with him , have gotten to be something that he looks forward to ; a chance to feel better twice a week , even if the feeling does n't have much carry-over yet . Now , on top of the shame , is disgust with himself for his slandering words . Not just Berger , but his father , too . Christ Jarrett but you 're a two-faced bastard . She says , " Things were so different in the hospital . People were , you know , turned on all the tune . And you just ca n't live like that . You ca n't live with all that emotion floating around , looking for a place to land . It 's too exhausting . It takes so much energy , just to get through a day , even without all that soul-searching we used to do ? " " Hey , " he says . " Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go with the things that made you laugh ? Yesterday I heard a guy on the radio talking about how to take care of your trees . If you water after five , be sure to water only every other root . ' In other words , ' he says , the U.S. Department of Agriculture requests that you use alternate roots after five o'clock . ' " She is laughing at him at last . " Con , you made that up ! " " No , the guy said it , I swear . I laughed for five minutes . It made me feel good . To know the nuts still have a chance to take over the world . " . In the hospital , he was the only one who could make her laugh I In heart swells with pleasure and gratitude. ( : alntlV , so as not to alarm her , he says , " You know , losing ; a whole year out of your life is turning out to be sort of a disadvantage , do n't you think ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You should n't either . Just keep going , get into things , forget about that . Try to he less intense . " Well , that 's what he was asking for , was n't it ? Then why do the words irritate him so ? With an imaginary pencil he writes in the palm of his hand . " Just a minute , ' less intense , ' let me get this all down , gee , you sure do make it sound simple , Dr. Aldrich . " She frowns and looks away . " It is n't simple . And I 'm not saying everything 's perfect . But at least I try . " " I 'm trying , " he says . He makes a face , teasing her . " Do n't I act like I 'm trying ? " " I do n't know . I do n't really know you , Con . " This hurts . And then she looks at her watch , and this hurts , too . " I 'm late . I 've got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He spreads his hands , palms down on the table . 56  | She hesitates . " Listen , call me again . I 'd like to see you . Really . I mean it . Will you ? " " Sure . " Call me , I 'd like to see you . But just not real soon . I might be crazy but I 'm not dumb . I read . She gathers her coat about her shoulders . " ' I'he thing is , " she says , " we should both be careful about who we see . It is n't good for either of us to get down . " " I 'm not down ! " It is definitely not the thing to be . More calmly , he repeats it . " I 'm not down . " " Well , it 's contagious , you know that . " Her voice is flat , accusing . " We ca n't risk it . " " Okay . " Nothing more to say . He glances across the aisle at the rack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wear and How to Wear It ; How to Make the Most of What You 've Got ; Twenty-five Ways to Better Love-Making . Oh , God , he did not come here to drain strength away from her he would not do that to anyone least of all her . They are friends are n't they ? She gets to her feet . " I 'm sorry . I wish I could stay longer . You look great , Con . You really do . " " Yeah , thanks . You too . " " And you will call me ? " " Yeah , sure . " And then she is gone . I le sits awhile longer , palming the empty Coke glass back and forth between his hands . He had thought , this morning , that he would ask her to one of the swim meets . I h ) vv stupid even to think that she would go for that . Dull stuff anyway , compared to A Thousand Clowns . Ah come on Jarrett do n't be a . shit she is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business how would you like it if . some screwed-up bastard kept coining around asking you Jr inhelp asking you to make him feel Necessary ? 57  | There is a sign over the door : NO LOITERING . The counterman /waiter keeps glancing over , getting ready to catch him in the act . He carefully folds his straw into a small rectangle and drops it into his glass . Getting to his feet , he puts on his jacket . Okay Karen we 'll see you around who needs you anyway who the fuck needs anybody ? 58  | This Saturday he has repaired a broken doorknob , watched Michigan beat Navy on television , played two sets of tennis with Al Cahill , his next-door neighbor . A familiar and comforting pattern of triviality ; the things that move time . First , sitting in the den with his feet up , a glass of beer beside him ; then the tennis . Ile was even pleased about the doorknob ; it gave the day that tiny period of purpose , and ( protected his soul from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water . This first drink of a Saturday evening , made for him self , and drunk in his own company is another pleasure . I , ater on , he may become bored and drink too much . Or else he will enjoy himself , relax , and drink too nnlch . Another familiar pattern . He has noted this about himself lately : that he drinks too much when they go out . Because drinking helps . It has gotten him through many evenings , either deadening the pain or raising him above it to where small events seem pleasurable and worth  | recording . It is n't likely that this will happen tonight . Tonight will not be memorable . He will have to take care not to get blitzed . Waiting for Beth , he wanders into the den . Conrad lounges on the couch in Levis and a T-shirt , hands in his pockets , legs stuck out in front of him , his boot heels digging into the carpet . " Your basic teen-ager , " Cal observes . Conrad eyes the gray slacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburban lawyer . " Ile sits down beside him on the couch . " What 're you watcching ? .. " Du n no . Just got here . " . From the television set comes the fervent announcemet t " Watch the Pete I'e/pper Show ! Share the joys of I:mnils living ! " .. Who the hell is Pete Pepper ? " he asks . Conrad laughs . " You got nn ... " Where were you today ? I needed a tennis partner . " " Over in Skokie . " " Oh ? Doing what ? " " Seeing somebody I know . " " Anybody I know ? " " No . " Period . A long way to go for friendship . All the way to Skokie . What happened to the people closer to home ? " What 're you doing tonight ? " " Studying . Got a history mid-term on Tuesday .

" You see much of him ? " " Every morning on the way to school . At practice . On the way home . " 60  | Not an answer , really , but it is conversation . Cal wants to keep it flowing between them . How to do this ? Sometimes it is so difficult , feeling his way with this mysterious stranger , his son . He asks , " Why do n't you call him and see what he 's doing tonight ? " " I think I ought to study . " " Ca n't you study tomorrow ? " " Yeah , I 'm planning on it . " His eyes have not left the set . " It 's a mid-term , Dad . " " Okay . I guess it takes time to get back in the swing of it again , huh ? " Conrad looks over at him and grins . " You been hanging around with Grandfather again ? " Cal laughs . He will be eighteen in January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet older at the same time . Tired . His face is drawn . He has an urge to shield him , but how ? There is no way . No way at all . He wants to give him a present of some kind , something to keep the currents of sound moving between them . He says , " Your mother and I were talking about going to London sometime . " " Not for Christmas ? " There is an odd look on his face that Cal can not identify . Fear ? Anger ? It is gone before he can be sure . " We have n't decided when , " he says . " I thought maybe in the spring . No , this ( : hristinas I thought we 'd just stay around here . " " Yeah , that 'd be fine . Unless  --  if everybody else wants to go for Christmas , I 'll go , that 's okay . I do n't want to spoil things . I mean , if she wants to go , I 'll go . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cal . " " Okay . In a second . " " We 're late . " She moves down the hallway to get her coat . He is on his feet , but he does n't want to leave yet .  | Conrad is looking up at him . There is nothing to worry about ; he knows that . He has to get over this feeling of panic every time he leaves him alone in the house . He 's a big boy . He will be eighteen years old in January . Remember it . " We 'll be over at the Murrays ' , did I tell you that ? " " No . Fine . " " The number 's in the book . Philip Murray , on Anhinga Boulevard . " " Okay . " And he knows what Conrad is thinking : What would I need to rill you for ? In the car , she s ; cvs to him , " I told you he 'd go if you asked hint ...

I le has n't realized until this minute that it has been several weeks since the subject of London was mentioned . Now he feels at once relief and guilt . " We 'll go in the spring , " he says . " I promise . " She does n't answer . " Who 's going to be there tonight ? " Testing . Her tone when she answers will tell him if she is angry . " Well , the Murrays . It 's their house . " She slides over next to him . Happily grateful , he squeezes her hand . Wonderful , unpredictable girl . " And Mac and Ann Kline . Ed and Marty Genthe . And us . " " Why us ? We hardly know the Murrays . " " That 's why . That 's why you have people over , darling . To get to know them better . " I le does not want to know Phil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him three times .

" He had laughed and said that he had all the insurance he needed . " That 's what you think . " Phil grinned at him . On discovering what Cal did for a living , he spent the rest of the round telling jokes about crooked lawyers . During the second round , Cal confirmed his earlier suspicion that he cheated on the golf course , saw his ball land with a thud in the trap ; when they arrived at the shot , it hung , miraculously , on the lush green edge . Worse , Phil was fakily delighted . " Hey , what a break ! That was close , huh ? " Cal thought he was the only one who noticed , but afterward , in the locker room , Mac Kline shook his head , " Who does he think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a joke about the best traps being the ones with the thickest lips . He says , " Let 's go to the movies , instead . " " Do n't be negative . " She squeezes his hand . " Then , let 's not stay too late . " She is looking at herself in the rear-view mirror . " Already ? You do n't usually say that until we pull in the driveway . Anyway , you 've never even been to their house before . How do you know you wo n't have fun ? " " I can read my mind . It says , Stay home tonight , read The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , do something constructive with your life . " " Everybody has to eat , " she says .

She is a tiny woman ; nearly a head shorter than ( Beth . " Ed , move over , will you ? Make room for Ileth .

She does look gorgeous . " Cal , what would you like ? " Phil asks . " Scotch ? " " Yes , please . Just a short one . " " Short on water ? " Phil laughs . " Short on scotch ? " . " Hey , c'm on , it 's a party , " Ed says . " Hey , somebody , how about a Dewar 's ad on this guy ? What 's the latest book you 've read , Cal ? " " How about The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich , the first hundred pages , " Beth says . " Four times . Will that do ? " Cal says , " Not funny . " " How about a quote ? " Ile thinks a minute . " The only way to deal with absurdity is to recognize it . ' How 's that ? " " Pretty good . That yours ? " 64  | " Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in those things ? Who talks like that ? " Sara comes in from the kitchen , a tray of cocktail snacks in her hands , all gracefully arranged in rows : sausages and mushrooms in tiny , fluted pastry shells ; crusty little pillows bulging with some unidentified , gooey filling ; hot puffs of cheese-flavored dough . She passes the tray around . " Come on , take lots . " " Cal , you playing in the Lawyers ' Invitational next spring ? " Mac Kline drifts over to where he is standing , beside the mantel . " I do n't know . I 'm not sure I posted enough scores this year to qualify . " " You ever won that thing ? " Ed asks . " Are you kidding ? Too many lawyers play golf . " " Too many lawyers play golf is right , " Phil says . " Try to get on that course on a Thursday afternoon . Hey , that reminds me ? " and he is off on another crookedlawyer joke . Sara jockeys in between Cal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the V of the gown . He studies the tray in stern concentration . To raise his eyes a mere three inches would he to give her what she wants ; she would like to catch him sneaking a look , he can feel it , and he would do it , too , if it were not for a frenetic-butterfly manner that she radiates . It grates on his nerves . She has an endless supply ' of nervous energy . Tiny women are often like this , he thinks . They never run down . They overwhelm him , make him feel lumpish and stupid . Too large . l le glances at his wife , who is not that type at all . She is cool and quiet and relaxed at parties . He would prefer sitting next to her , talking to her . That is often the case with him . I le likes women , but not nervous women . He has tried to like Sara and ,  | at times , he has almost succeeded . So long as he does n't have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be married to a damned butterfly . " I saw Conrad the other day , " Marty Genthe says . " Uptown . It 's nice that someone that age still believes in courtesy . Most of Donald 's friends remember my face , but they ca n't be bothered putting a name to it . It 's just , ' Oh , hi there . ' " And suddenly , everyone is listening . " I low is he doing ? " Ann asks . " I heard the boys say he 's swimming . " . " He 's fine , " Beth says . There is something final and forbidding about the answer , but Sara does n't hear it . They are still newcomers here , and she wants to be polite . Inquiring after people 's children is accepted form every here . She asks , " Has he been sick ? " " He was sick for a while , " Beth says . " lie 's fine , now . " " Another drink , Cal ? " " Yes , sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bar , the skin on the backs of his hands tightening , as if from an electric shock . He sits between Ann Kline and Marty Genthe at the table , with Sara across from him . " Sara , what a meal ! " Marty says . " This is a tough act to follow , dear . " " Oh , no , " she protests , " it 's just plain food . I ca n't cook fancy , honestly . No , Beth is the artist in that department . I do n't know how she does it ! " " The cheese sauce is great , " Ed says . " Marty , get that recipe , will you ? " After the main course comes strawberry mousse ; it is flawless . Then the children are served up . They enter 66  | the living room on cue , to say their good nights . A command performance for all . The guests are politely impressed . Cal can not help being touched at their grave good manners . All four of them are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reproductions , but stunning originals . Their handsome , dark-eyed fourteen-year-old daughter supervises her younger brother and sister , while the eldest boy stands , shy and solemn , in the background . He reminds Cal of Conrad at that age . So earnest , so polite . Adults and children beam awkwardly at one another until Sara 's motherly pride is satisfied , and they are dismissed . " Good-looking children , " Cal says . " Thank you . " She beams him a grateful smile . In knots of two and three , they sit in the living room . Beth and Mac are in one corner , consulting earnestly about books , he is sure . Mac Kline is an English professor at Lake Forest College , who loves to talk about his subject . Beth would talk books to a deaf person , needing nothing more than an encouraging nod , now and then . He catches her eye and she smiles at him . Across the room , Ann and Phil and Ed are horsing around , Ed giving a lecture on the perfect tennis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pupils . ( ; al sits on the couch between Sara and Marty , feeling pleasantly high , and full . " Great dinner , " he tells Sara . " Thank you . " " When are we going to play some bridge , Cal ? " Marty asks . " Yeah , we ought to do that . " He has an arm around each of them , and has to disengage one from Sara to sip his drink . " I mean , now that you two are social , again , " Marty says . " How are things , really ? Going all right ? " 67  | Marty is looking at him . A brittle , attractive redhead , she lost out on beauty through the accident of a razorplaned , imperious nose . One New Year 's Eve , he remembers kissing her . A long , warm embrace . He was drunk . No one said anything about it afterward , not Ed , or Beth . He was surprised . He had felt guilty and embarrassed ; he would have said something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Beth . " Yes , pretty well , " he says . " Only I miss the kids who used to hang around . What 's Don doing these days ? I have n't seen him in a while . " " Oh , the same old things . Girls . Swimming . You know how boys tine , t hey do n't tell you anything unless you hack theta into a corner and bulldoze it out of theta " She laughs . " To tell you the truth , Donald says Conrad is n't very  --  is n't as friendly as he used to be . I Suppose he feels a little , I do n't know , self-conscious ? " " About what ? " Sara asks . " I 'm sorry , maybe it 's none of ' my business . ' . " No , it 's nothing , " Cal says . He is suddenly uncomfortable . The drinks have made him fuzzy . He should n't have said that , about the boys not coming around . It sounded as if he were annoyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does n't come to practice on Tuesdays and Fridays . " " No . There 's a doctor in Evanston . He sees him twice a week . " " You mean he 's still having problems ? " " Not exactly . It 's somebody to talk to , " he says lamely . He looks down into his glass . This was not the direction he had intended the conversation to take . Sara is laughing loudly and elaborately at the antics of her husband , across the room , having decided not to 68  | get into this , after all . A wise decision . He wishes he had done the same . " Cal , we 've got to go , " Beth calls across to him . " It 's late . " " Hey , what d' you mean ? Party 's just getting off the ground ! " Phil protests as they move toward the hall . " Okay , you 'll be sorry ! We 'll talk about you ! " Somehow they are into their coats and out the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , coolness against his cheeks , and silence as he opens the car door for her , closes it , walks around behind the car , gets in under the wheel . " Do you want me to drive ? " she asks . He glances at her , surprised . " I 'm not drunk , " he says . " Do you think I 'm drunk ? " " I do n't know , are you ? " So she had heard it . " No , " he says . " No , I am not , I promise . " Seeking to lead her away from it , he laughs . " The thing you ca n't forgive about Phil Murray is that he 's a goddamn , crashing bore . One more crooked-lawyer joke and I start in on my pesky-insurance-salesman routine ? " " I want to tell you something , " she says . " You drink too much at parties . " " Okay . " " She pumped you , " she says . " And you let her do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and in front of someone who does n't even know us . " " My sentiments exactly . " I le nods , hoping to head her off , hoping she is not really angry , because he does n't feel drunk tonight , just good and high ; he would like to keep feeling good a while longer . Ile reaches over and pats her knee with clumsy affection . " Why did you tell her he was seeing a psychiatrist ? " 69  | " Look , some people consider that a status symbol , " he says , " right up there with going to Europe . " " I do n't . And I thought your blurting it out like that was in the worst possible taste . " " I 'm sorry . " " Not to mention a violation of privacy . " " Whose privacy ? " he asks . " Whose privacy did I vio-late ? " She does not answer . The light is on in Conrad 's room . He is asleep , lying on his back , his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep I lis hair is damp , clinging slickly to his totem a ( I , cur ling against his neck . A book lies faceclown and open on the heel . U.S. History : Constitution to I're.w  --  nt Puy. ( : at picks up the hook and closes it quietly . I le sets it on the night stand . Reaching for the switch on the lamp , Ia ' looks at Conrad . His left arm is shoved underneath the pillow . His right is outstretched ; the hand with its strong , square fingers curved protectively over the palm is motionless . Still biting his nails . A nervous habit . So what ? Lots of people do it ; he himself used to do it when he was that age . He looks , really looks , this time at the thin , vertical scar that extends up the inside of the arm , above the palm . More than two inches long , ridged , a gray-pink line . " He meant business , " the intern told him in the ambulance . " Horizontal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer . You were damn lucky to catch him . " I sigh achievers , Dr. Crawford told him , set themselves impossible standards . They have this need to perform well , to look good ; they suffer excessive guilt over failure . He had groped to understand . " But what has he failed at  --  He 's never failed at anything ! " 70  | Conrad 's head moves on the pillow , and Cal snaps off the light , not allowing himself to look again at the scar , not wanting to be guilty of any more violations of privacy . Listen , he prays , let the exams he easy . Do n't let him feel he is failing . Beth is awake , waiting for him , her hair loose about her shoulders . She reaches up to put her arms around him , all tawny , smooth skin , those gray eyes with thick lashes , silent and insistent . She leads tonight , and he follows , moving swiftly down that dark river , every-thing floating , melting , perfect , and complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hair , soft and furry against his shoulder , smells sweet and fresh , like wood fern . He buries his face in it , still hungry . " Let me hold you awhile . " But she is tired . She curls away from him ; pushes him gently from her , in sleep . He rolls to his back , hands under his head , staring upward . Other Saturday nights , lying , waiting after ' sex , for the comforting sound of a car door slamming , and whispers of laughter under the windows . And earlier , at the beginning of the evenings , the endless jokes , the hassles over clothes Hey , that 's my sweater ! The hell it is , possession is  --  heft , Dad , what 's possession ? Possession is gon na get your head broke  --  now give it to me ! And sounds of a struggle and fiendish , sadistic laughter ' lake it , lag , it v a fag sweater , you 'll look great in it and more laughter You ought a know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours ; another side effect of drinking too much . It condemns him to wakefulness . Without expectation of anything  --  of a car , of whispers or laughter . Resigned , he keeps watch and continues to listen . 71  | A surprise quiz in trig . Ile takes his seat , the mimeographed sheet iii his hand , his stomach pulling nervously . He wills himself not to panic . I know this stuff I know it . Across the aisle from him sits Suzanne Mosely . They have known each other since grade school . What is she doing in here ? She must have flunked it , too , last year . Ile watches as her pudgy fingers grip the pencil . Her brow is furrowed ; her mouth pinched . It makes him ashamed of his own fear . She has always had trouble in math , could take it from now until the world ends and it wo n't help . He looks up . Mr. Simmons is staring at him . Guiltily he looks down at his paper . Given : reduction formulas sin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ = cos ( ? 0 ) Stay calm . It will come do n't think about anything else . just the problem easy does it confidence .  | Halfway through the test his pencil point snaps . He straightens up ; lets out his breath with a sigh . Not hard . It is not as hard as he thought it would be . His back is tense , and he rubs it , stretching . He goes to get another pencil from the box on Simmons ' desk . No pencil-sharpening during a quiz , that is one of the unbreakable rules . Simmons looks up . " Everything okay , Jarrett ? " He nods , returning to his seat . Out of the corner of his eye he can see Suzanne 's paper . Cross-outs everywhere . The poor kid . He knows what that feels like . What did she take this course for anyway ? There are five minutes left in the hour when he hands in his paper . He leaves the room , taking up a spot against the lockers as he waits for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoking lounge overflows with people let out of class early . He does not go down there . He has nothing to say to anyone . Suzanne comes out and leans against the wall . Her head is bent over her books . She is wearing a dark skirt , a brown sweater that 's too tight . God , she 's so fat . Has she always been that fat ? Ile does n't remember it . I flinched over , huddled against the wall , her hair stiff , like brown cotton candy . A lion 's mane around her face . Pretty . She was pretty in junior high . She is staring at him now , atul he straightens up Shit she is crying The tears are spilling ( low ' ) her cheeks . He stands there helpless , watching . " What are you looking at ? " She clutches her books against her breasts as he moves toward her . " Hey . It 's only a stupid test . " She glares at him . " You can say that . You passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , why am I so dumb ! I work and work at it and it 's all a jumble .... " 73  | " It 's just crap , " he says . " Tangents , cotangents , when are you ever going to use them ? It does n't matter . " The bell rings and she jumps . She turns away from him and he has to run to catch up with her . " Listen , if you want some help She stops in the middle of the hall to stare at him . " I 'll help you . I can explain it , if you want . In study hall . Or after school some night . " " Why would you want to do that ? " she asks , her eyes narrowing . " No . No thanks , it 's all right . " The crowd sweeps them along in its flow , and a voice tads across the hall : " I by . Jarrett ! " Ile looks over . Stillman grins at him . Sccianne has gone on ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling relieved , and yet oddly hurt . In the locker room that afternoon , Stillman lies in wait .

" Hey , c'm on , Jarrett , I 'll let you know about Pratt , if you let me know about Mosely . " " Mosely ? " Van Buren echoes , " Mosely ? " Ile slams his locker closed and their laughter follows him up the stairway to the pool . Pricks . To hell with them forever . I n bed he waits for sleep . He can not get under until he has reviewed the day , counted up his losses . He must learn more control , can not allow himself the luxury of anger . Ile has seen it happen before . Guys become easy targets for the Stillmans of the world . Next time laugh when needles you . 74  | What about the test ? Did he pass it ? He thinks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Suzanne ? It does n't matter and suddenly it clicks into place : why Simmons had kept such an eye on him all through the hour . Oh God , that was the class . Last year . A quiz being returned . Across his paper in red pencil Incomplete . See Me . He had stared at it all through the hour while the rest of the class discussed and made corrections . No use listening , none of it meant anything to him . He sat there , his eyes slowly filling with tears , trying to blink them back but they would not stop , and Simmons bending over his desk , asking Jarrett , are you sick ? Nodding , stumbling up the aisle , facing the blackboard as Simmons wrote out a hall pass . An electric wall of silence behind them . Out of the classroom , heading not toward the nurse 's office , but toward the double exit doors . Into the parking lot to find a car that was unlocked . Him on the floor in the back seat , crying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left school that day , walked around uptown , looking in windows at the Christmas displays . When it was time he went home . And the next day , the last before Christmas vacation , his homeroom teacher had called him up to the desk . " I got a skip notice on you this morning . What hap-pened ? " " Nothing . I did n't feel like going to class . " " Were you sick ? " " No . " The teacher had looked at him . " Okay . Let 's forget it . We 'll talk about it after the holidays . " The holidays . Christmas in Florida . I eying on the bed at the Sonesta Beach in his bathing suit , staring at a mosquito above his head , its tiny body pressed against the rough plaster ceiling , spreading a half-inch gray shadow on the stark white . The only memory he has of 75  | that period . That , and the ceaseless , remorseless blue of ocean . Brightness surrounds him . No shadows but it must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet a breeze bends the spiky beach grass double to the sand . He walks . The moon is above him and to his left . Miles and miles the sand stretches in front of him a cool smooth highway and the mouth of the tunnel appears a metal cylinder curving ten feet over his head the lower rim buried in the , sand . He enters it Brightly lit inside its walls a polished silver graft like the inside of a galvanized pail girders binning the rib rage that supports its walls . A sharp right turn ahead obscures his view when he turns the corner there is disappointment the tunnel continues on no end in sight only the dimensions have shrunk . He can touch the walls now the ceiling too smooth and cold against his hands . The backs of his legs ache . He kneels down to rest sifting the fine sand from the tunnel floor through his fingers it blows away from him taking the shape of the wind like pictures in a fairy-tale book but there is no wind in the tunnel and no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovering that the dimensions have shrunk again and now he must move forward on his hands and knees but even then his head brushes the ceiling the light is less bright and he can not see clearly just shadows on the sand and ahead of him another turn he moves eagerly toward it . A makeshift rectangular chute beyond the turn the sides are shored with two by fours . He is perplexed vaguely angry what crumby workmanship how will he maneuver here he must crawl on his stomach scraping 76  | piles of sand toward himself he is too tired for this game would like to quit but still he keeps going wriggling past the first set of shorings before he rests again . He puts his head down and the cool sand feels pleasant and grainy under his cheek . When he raises his head he sees nothing . Only darkness . Ile is convulsed with panic begins to work himself backward and his feet strike the wall of the tunnel he shifts his position and tries again solid wall no matter where he moves his head wedged against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is sealed in this metal tomb and the walls press upon him from all sides he can not breathe can not move must must twisting violently onto his back he screams It wakes him . He can hear the echo of it inside his head . Did he scream out loud ? He listens for some sound in the house , for someone pounding out of bed and down the hall toward his room . Nothing . The blood tingles in his veins , hot and then cold . His heart is pounding painfully . He sits up ; turns on the light , but slowly , slowly . No sudden movements . He feels as if he could shatter into a million pieces if he is jarred . " I do n't hold much stock in dreams , " 1terger says . " In fact , I do n't hold stock . Of any kind . " He is annoyed . " What the hell kind of psychiatrist are you ? They all believe in dreams . " " Do they ? Goddamn , I 'm always outa step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . On the floor , that 's it . I want to try something . " " Christ ! You 're nuts , you know that ? " Still , he obeys , lowering himself to the carpet and stretching out , ankles crossed , hands behind his head . 77  | " Change of perspective , " Berger says . He likewise lowers himself . " Steadies the blood . " " Steadies the blood , " he scoffs . " This is stupid . Besides , I lie down all the time at home . It does n't help . Maybe I need some kind of tranquilizer . " " Tranquilizer ? " " Yeah . What d' you think ? " " I think , " Berger says , " that you come in here looking like something out of The Body Snatchers . It is not my impression that you are in need of a tranquilizer . " " I feel nervous all the time . I ca n't sleep . " " Maybe your schedule 's too heavy . You 're trying to do too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two . " " No . " " No . Why not ? " " Because . I 'm behind already . " " Behind what ? The Great Schedule in the Sky ? The Golden Gradebook ? What ? " " God , you 're preaching again . And your ceiling 's dirty . " " So , sue me . Listen , kiddo , I lied . I believe in dreams , and I especially believe in yours , they 're fascinating as hell . Only sometimes I like you to tell me about what happens to you when you 're awake , okay ? Something is bugging you , something is making you nervous . Now what is it ? " He sits up ; reaches for his coffee . " Okay , I know what it is . I do n't want to swim any more . I look horrible , my timing is for shit . He 's got two guys who are better than me swimming the fifty , and , anyway , I do n't give a damn about those guys , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stand him , he 's a tight-ass son of a bitch ?

" " I ca n't . It 'd look so stupid . I go to him and beg for one more chance . Then , I swim for two months and quit again . Ca n't you see how stupid that would look ? " " Forget how it looks . I low does it feel ? " He shakes his head . " No . That 's what happened last year . It 's the same damn thing I did last year . " " Forget last year . You think you 're the same person you were last year ? " He shrugs , lying down again , staring upward at the ceiling . " So , tell me about the coach , " Berger says . " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiles faintly . " I do n't know . He 's a jerk . He says to me  --  this is typical ?

" " What did you say ? " " I told him I was n't planning on going back . Ile says , No , I do n't suppose you are . ' " " Sometimes , " Berger says , " people say stupid things . They feel like they got ta say something , you know ? " " Sometimes people say stupid things , because they 're stupid . " A wooden clock on the wall behind his head ticks away loudly , and it is relaxing to lip here with this placid man beside him , talking of anger and of change , without being irrevocably committed to it . I le could go to sleep here ; right now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock , time to go home . " This problem , kiddo , " Berger says , " it 's real , you know . A good , healthy problem needs a good , healthy 79  | solution . Point of separation . Between the sicks and the wells . Real problems , real solutions , you get it ? " He rolls onto his stomach , his head buried in his arms . " Sounds like a chapter heading to me . " Berger sighs . " I hope to hell you 're writing this stuff down . It 'll be a shame if it 's lost to the future generations . " " I 've got it taped up over the back of the john . " 80  | Laughter drifts upstairs from the locker room , loud and raucous . From the top of the stairs , he can hear Stillman , his voice raw with complaint : " Lazenby , Jesus , why you so nervous about making a commitment , just yes or no ! " " It costs money , that 's why . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing . " " Hell , it 's a goddamn French sex film , what more do you have to know ? " More laughter , and he starts down the stairs , rubbing his head with a towel . Lazenby says , " Okay . Ilow about if ' I ask Jarrett ? " And he stops ; loops the towel around his neck , listening . " You ever think about doing anything without Jar-rett ? " " What 's that mean ? " " Means what it says . I just wondered . " Centhe says , " Hey , what 's with him anyway ? How  | come he gets all the extra practice time ? Hell , I could look better if I had extra practice time ? " " Genthe , you could n't look better if you were a girl , " Truan jeers . " That 's the goddamned truth . " He stands outside the open door , smoothing his hand lightly along the polished wood frame , slowly , slowly . Lazenby says , " I just thought we 'd ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you hang around with flakes , " Stillman says . " You get flaky . " " Man , d' you mind ? " Lazenby asks mildly . " He 's a friend of mine . " " He 's ' a flake . ' You ought a get off his back , Kevin , " Van Buren says . " The guv 's got enough problems . ' . " Ile sure has . " More laughter and he clot 's not wait to hear the rest , but turns air ' ul ) tly , heading back up the stairs . Nothing touches hint on the way , not even the air in the hallway . Salan is sitting where he left him , his head still bent over the clipboard . He listens , his mouth a taut line , as Conrad explains . That it is something he has been thinking about for a long time , and he is sure , now , he knows he is doing the right thing . At last , he says , " Jarrett , you got ta be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excuse you from practice twice a week so you can see some shrink .

" A bright kid like you , " Salan continues , " with every-82  | thing going for him . I do n't get it . Why do you want to keep messing up your life ? " He says carefully , " I do n't think it 'll mess up my life if I stop swimming . " Stay calm stall calm this is not a spastic leap this is a well-thought-out sane and sensible decision . A real solution to a real problem Salan says flatly , " Okay . This is it . You 're a big kid now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back again . You remember that . " Fucking swell I 'll remember all right . Aloud he says , " No , sir . I wo n't ask you to , sir . " The locker room is empty . He showers , dresses , packs his athletic bag , making sure all his stuff is cleaned out of the locker . Stalling , but he knows it 's no good , Lazenby will wait for him . He does n't want to ride home with them , does n't want to see them again , but it would look stupid , letting them sit there , sneaking out the back door , and why the hell should he walk ? Why should he freeze his ass off because they are jerks and pricks ? He heads for the car . The smell of snow is in the air . Early this year . It is still a week before Thanksgiving . Truan , Van Buren , and Stillman are iii t lie hack seat . He gets in front , setting his bag on the floor . Lazenby asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He declines . He has to study . " You ought a lay off studying , Jarrett , " Stillman says . " Screws up your mind . Keep all the channels clear up there for heavy thought . " They laugh . To his ears , the sound is forced ; false . " We 'll be back by eleven , " Lazenby says . " No . I can't. " 83  | " Who says ? " Stillman asks . " Your mom ? " He ignores that , not answering . The ride seems long . Even though he is the first to be dropped off . " I 'll see you tomorrow , " Lazenby says . " About eighttwenty . " " I 've got to go early tomorrow , " he says . " I 'll get a ride with my dad . " " How early ? I can go a little early ? " " No , that 's okay . I 'll see you there . " Let them find out from Salim that he is finished with then . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father- stops at the door of his room that night . The ritual ** . " I low 's it going ? . " " Okay . Fine . " I le returns the ritual answer . It is not a lie , really ; just the safest thing to say for now . He does not want to discuss it tonight . A small thing , after all . To mention it is to make too much of it , and there will be flak ? " Why ? Did something happen ? Is anything the matter ? " ? and he is n't ready for it . Not yet . He has done it , maybe for the wrong reasons , but it was the right thing to do . There is no problem improving your tuning , or perfecting a stroke , if the desire is there , but you can not fire up , can not manufacture desire , when there is no spark at all to build on . This was not a mistake , what happened today . It is not to be looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trip to Maine and climbed Cadillac Mountain , looking in every direction  --  nothing to see but water except for the thin strip of land , an arm and a fist , holding the mountain and the park to the state of Maine . They tried to look beyond the . water to the east and Portugal ; to the north , the 84  | Hebrides , Iceland ; to the south , the Antilles and farther , South America and the Antarctic Peninsula . Impressive , they tossed out the adjectives , Majestic . Awesome . And then somebody said excessive , and they all laughed . That was it . Everything seems excessive , now , and too intense , too important . Karen is right , learn to relax , do n't think so much , just be . Night is fast replacing morning as the worst time of day for him . The way it used to be in the months after the accident . He was n't sleeping much . And suddenly , he was n't sleeping at all , he was unable to close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seethed from night until morning . He would set his alarm at eleven and crawl into bed , praying , and he would lie there and lie there until at last he would hear the warning click as the radio turned itself on and it was morning again . His father would come down the hall , to make sure he was awake . Awake . And he was never able to tell them , he would get up , get dressed , eat his breakfast , go to school , just as if his ass was n't dragging on the goddamn ground , he was so tired , so tired . He told Crawford once that was why he had done it  --  he had to get some sleet . But things are not that bad . Not vet . There are still methods that work , and he rolls onto his lace , hands between his legs . They used to kid each other about it .

At least that 's what I get from the stuff going out over the telephone wires . She 's got her own personal Ann Landers on the other end , I guess . Lord , I wish she 'd blow her nose ! " " You 're a hard-hearted bastard , " Cal says . " Yeah , she 'll find out how hard-hearted if she does n't get some of this mail out . Not that I 'd presume to compare it with the tragedy of the century that 's going on out there . " " Somebody who 's going through a romantic crisis should n't be expected to get the mail out .

" " Hey , buddy , do n't get on my back . I 'm not Cherry . " Ray laughs . " See ? What she 's doing to me ? Making me into a browbeater and a nagger , with my own partner , Jesus ! " An endless parade of secretaries . I lc has seen them interviewed , instructed , hired , used , and lost , forever and ever , on into eternity . They have been doing it for seven years . It has been that long since they have had a good legal secretary . Since Lynn Searles . Poor Cherry . People are like icebergs ; one-seventh visible and operative , and the rest just so much protoplasmic energy , seething around under there , looking for a target to funnel toward . Too bad she picked the wrong target . Yet it 's hard to imagine that giddy , empty girl with any hidden energies ; how did she summon up that much feeling for anybody ? Watch it  --  your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He has become immune to the sufferings of others . I do n't give a damn . Let them hurt . The things which hurt instruct  --  Ilenjamin Franklin . That was one of Arnold 's favorites . Not true , though . The things which hurt do n't always instruct . Sometimes they merely hurt . Ask inc . Ask Nancy Hanley . Instruct sounds like such a positive word , but he doubts whether Hay 's wife . even now , would believe in that saying . In any case , he would not ask her . A long time ago , and water over the dam . Lynn Searles . What made hint think of her ? Stern , straight-thinking Lynn , who always looked right into your eyes when she spoke to you , as if she could see behind them and into your head . Ile wonders , icily , what she is doing now . He wonders if Nay knows ; if he knows where she is . Another question he would not ask . What was that ? Water over the clam ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch it , he is getting to think more like Howard every day . He runs into Carole Lazenby downstairs in the Plaza . Hatless , wearing a tweed pantsuit , her large-boned , square figure looks farmlike , out of place here , among the coeds and snazzy secretaries parading the streets of Evanston at noontime . And because she looks so real and so alive , he is absurdly glad to see her ; asks her to go to lunch with him on the spot . " Gee , nobody 's asked nu ' to lunch in ages ! I wonder if I 'll know how to act ! ' . She oilers to take hint to the University Sandwich Shop , where she commands a discount with her student I.D . " What are you taking ? " he asks . She laughs , self-consciously . " It 's called Search for Identity . " Funny , he would never have picked her out as a woman with identity problems . He tells her so , but she just laughs . " Oh , come on . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what scared me . Maybe if I was your wife , I could handle it better . " " Why ? " " Why ? " She laughs again . " Oh , I do n't know . I guess because she does n't look it . " A pleasant lunch . He has forgotten how easy she is to talk to , how genuine . She asks about Con , and that makes it easy for him to inquire after Joe , to mention how he misses seeing him around the house , as he used to . " Yes , they do n't spend much time together , do they ? Well , you tell Connie that I miss him . Tell him to stop 88  | over some time soon . Beth , too . How is she ? I only see her at bridge once a month , and we never seem to get a chance to talk . " " She 's busy , too , " Cal says . " She 's chairing the tennis tournament at Onwentsia next spring . She spends a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her organization , " Carole says . " She 's such a perfectionist . And yet she never lets herself ' get trapped into things she does n't want to do . Now , there 's an art . I 'm just beginning to learn the trick myself . I hope it 's not too late ! " He walks Carole to the corner ; sends his greetings to John , and to Katy , their daughter . " We 'll get together , " he promises . On the way back to work he thinks , She never lets herself get trapped . Not strictly true . He can remember a period of their lives when she felt distinctly trapped . When Jordan was two years old , with Connie toddling around after him at ten months , both of them spreading havoc in that tiny northside apartment . Those first Jive years just passed in a blur ! he has heard her say gaily at parties . But he remembers them , and remembers the scenes : her figure , tense with fury as she scrubbed the fingermarks from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a toy left out of place , or a spoonful of food thrown onto the floor from the high chair . And it did not pay him to become exasperated with her . Once he had done so , had shouted at her to forget the damned cleaning schedule for once . She had flown into a rage , railed at him , and flung herself across the bed , in hysterics . Everything had to be perfect , never mind the impossible hardship it worked on her , on them all ; never mind the utter lack of meaning in such perfection , weighed as it was against the endless repetition of days , weeks , months . They learned , all of them , that 89  | certain things drove her to the point of madness : dirt tracked in on a freshly scrubbed floor ; water-spotted shower stalls ; articles of clothing left out of place . And , he had to admit , he liked a clean house ; he liked the order she brought into his life , perfectionist that she was . And so had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not since the summer before last and an unexpected July storm on Lake Michigan . He had left off being a perfectionist then , when he discovered that not promptly kept appointments , not a house circumspectly clean , not membership in Onrwentsia , or the Lake Forest Golf and ( : omit rV ( : Irrh , or the Lawyers ' Club , not power , or knowledge , or goodness  --  not anything  --  cleared you through the terrifying office of chance ; that it is chance and not perfection that rules the world .

Things do seem better , more relaxed , just since Thanksgiving . No , even before that . Is that illusion or reality ? Illusion or reality . Seven years ago , he had had a conversation on that very subject with Nancy Hanley . At the Law Club Christmas Dance , sitting on the upper deck of the Chicago Yacht Club . Nancy had leaned over and said to him , " Tell Beth for me how lucky she is , will you ? " " Why ? " have you . And never to have been disillusioned . " He had laughed embarrassed , knowing where it was leading He had emphatically not wanted to go into it , had never wanted to tike sides in the thing , but Nancy was not about to It him off the hook . " People stake mistakes , Nance . " . A mirthless laugh . " Yes , they do . " Carefully , because he had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effected between them , he had said , " Do n't you think people are entitled to a few mistakes in a lifetime ? " " No , " she said . " What people are entitled to are their illusions , and frankly , I preferred my illusions about him . I would have preferred it if he had screwed her until he was sick of it and gotten rid of her without my ever having found out about it at all . " " I ca n't believe that , " he told her . " Illusions are for fairy tales . Your marriage is stronger now ? " " Do n't bet on it . And if you ever do a survey , you 'll find that people prefer illusion to reality , ten to one . Twenty , even . Any odds you want to give , I 'll cover . " Worry and a bad marriage . Beth was joking . She said site had been joking . It had been seven years since Ray 's affair with Lynn . Seven years since Nancy had packed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Oklahoma , and Ray , wild with grief , had come charging into the office to tell him . " How could I have been so stupid , Cal ? How could I have been so selfish , thinking I had it so tough , having to come home to a squalling baby every night ? She 's gone , Cal ! She left me ! What the hell am I going to do without her ? " Well , things change ; people change . Lynn had left , and Nancy had come back , and they had moved out of their apartment and bought the big house in Glencoe . And surely Nancy is not the type of woman to live with somebody she does n't love " for the sake of the children . " No illusion there . They are still married ; therefore , they are happy . But he sees the point she had been making . Depending upon the reality one must face , one may prefer to opt for illusion . He wants so much to believe that all is well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he keep taking pulses , and looking for signs ?

" They drive through Evanston , decked out in all its Christmas finery : fake garlands of pine , wrapped around lampposts and colored lights strung across the intersections . It does not have the air of fantasy , of fairyland , that covers Lake Forest . It is too big a city for that ; its streets are too dirty , its buildings too coarsely utilitarian . Yet , there is a confidence and completeness about this town that Cal loves . Too many places he has been seem tainted with that anxious atmosphere of unreality ; a one-sidedness of conception . Too perfect to be believed . Aspen . Indianwood . Florida . Exotic and comfortless , like movie sets . " I tried to let you pick it out , " Conrad says . " We would have ended up with the worst one on the lot . You always want to buy some tree you feel sorry for . " " Never mind , sonny , " Cal says . " When we 're stringing popcorn and cranberries till our fingers fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat curls about their ankles , as thick as water . It goes up easily , fitting easily under the cathedral ceiling in the family room , dominating the space before the window . Crisp , blue-green lace splashes across the snow-white of the draperies . " I think it 's silly , " Beth had said that morning . " We 've got a perfectly good artificial one in the basement . The needles will absolutely imbed themselves in that white shag , Cal . " " It 's probably flat and limp as hell . We have n't used 107  | it for five years  --  do you realize it 's been that long since we 've had a tree ? We 're always on our way to somewhere a week before Christmas . " She had shrugged , turning away . " Do what you want . " She had had a meeting tonight anyway , so when Conrad met him at the office after his session Cal had suggested dinner out instead of the TV dinners waiting for them at home , and the tree-shopping expedition . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screws in the stand a final tightening . Conrad holds on to the trunk . " Some of the lights have burned out . I 'll pick up some extra bulbs on my ay home tomorrow , " Conrad says . The front door opens and a gust of cold air greets them Moments later , she wins them . " I low do von like it ? " ( ; : il asks . I le looks up through the brunches at her : a splash of orange skirt and paler orange blouse . Those graceful , pretty legs . " I like it , " she says . " It 's lovely . " He feels a sudden rush of love for her ; gets to his feet , floating and weightless again . " How was your meet-ing ? " " It was interesting , " she says . She goes to the bar at the opposite end of the room . " I think I want a drink . How about you ? " " Sure . Here , I 'll make them . " " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says to her . " You want to help ? " She looks at him for a long moment . " Of course . " " So what happened that was so interesting ? " Cal hands her the glass . Scotch she likes in the evening , short , and no ice . She swirls the oily liquid , looking down into it . " Not what happened , " she says . " What I heard . " " From whom ? " 108  | " From Carole Lazenby . " Something is wrong . The lunch that day ? He should have told her , probably , but he had n't thought anything about it . Just a lunch . Nothing to tell . " It 's not my news , " she says , " it 's Conrad 's . Maybe he should tell it . " " Tell what ? " Cal asks . Conrad is looking at her warily . " It was rather embarrassing , " she says , not looking at either of them . " Carole thought I knew . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a month ago . " " What happened ? " he asks . " Dad , " Conrad says , " I quit the swim team . " " Quit ? Why ? " And then it hits him : the nights he sat waiting for six-thirty , the newspaper in front of him , unconcerned . He knew exactly where his kid was . At practice . Riding home with Joe in the car . A month ago . And another picture , of Mr. Knight and Mr. Hellwarth at the meeting . They suggest that he call the counselor 's office on Fridays , for a " progress report . " " Just so we stay on top of things , Mr. Jarrett . " I le had rejected that plan immediately . No , it was too much like spying . A month ago . " Where have you been every night ? " he asks . " Nowhere , " Conrad says . " Around . The library , mostly . " " I do n't get it , " he says flatly . " Why did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . I 've been meaning to ? " " I 'm sure you would have told us before the first meet , " Beth says . " When is it , next Thursday ? " " I 'm sure I would have told you , " Conrad says , " if I thought you gave a damn ! " And the wellspring of anger erupts , engulfing them all . 109  | " What the hell does that mean ? " Cal demands . " Never mind , " she says . " It 's meant for me . Is n't it ? I wish I knew , Conrad , why it is still so important for you to try to hurt me ! " " Hurt you ? Me hurt you ! Listen , you 're the one who 's trying to hurt me ! " " And how did I do that ? By making you look like a fool in front of a roomful of people ? Did you have to sit there , getting those looks ? Poor Mrs. Jarrett , oh the poor woman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lies and lies and she believes every word of it ? " " I did n't lie ? " " You did ! You lied every night that you came into this house at six t hit t s What do you mean , you did n't lie ? " She presses het hands tight to her head . " I ca n't stand this , I really ca n't ! II its starting all over again , the lying and the disappearing , for hours , the covering up  --  I wo n't stand it ! " " Do n't , then ! " he snarls . " Go to Europe , why do n't you ? Go to hell ! " " Con ? " But he backs away from Cal 's hand . " Listen , do n't give me that , the only reason you care , the only reason you give a fuck about it is because someone else knew about it first ! You never wanted to know anything I was doing , or anything I was n't doing ; you just wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you alone , did n't I ? I could have told you lots of things ! Like , up at the hospital there were rats ! Big ones , up on three , with the hopeless nuts ! But that 's okay ; see , I was down on two , with the heads and the unsuccessfuls ? " " Con , shut up , stop it ? " " Damn it ! " he says . " Tell her to stop it ! You never tell her a goddamn thing ! Listen , I know why she never 110  | came out there , not once ! I know ! Hell , she was going to goddamn Spain and goddamn Portugal , why should she care if I was hung up by the goddamn balls out there ? " " Christ ! That 's enough ! " He takes a swift , sobbing breath , fixing them both with a look of utter fury . And then he is gone , his feet pounding up the stairs . Moments later , the shattering slam of his bedroom door . Beth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head . " I wo n't , I wo n't ! " He goes to her ; puts his arms around her . Her body is stiff . She is trembling , but she does not relax against him . " What happened ? " he asks . " What the hell hap-pened ? " " I do n't know ! " I " Somebody 'd better go up there . " " Go ! " she says . " Go ahead , that 's the pattern , is n't it ? Let him walk all over us , then go up there and apologize to him ! " " I 'm not going up to apologize . " " Yes , you are ! You always do ! You 've been apologizing to him ever since he ( ' aloe hone ! " " Ah , Beth , crissake , lay off , will you ' : ' I feel like I 've been at a goddamn tennis match tonight ! Back and forth , back and forth ? " " Do n't talk to me like that ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do n't talk to me like he talks to you ! " He grabs her , holds her , his cheek colliding with her skull , hard . " I 'm sorry , " he murmurs . " I 'm sorry , let 's not fight .... " He rocks her in his arms , gently , and her hands are up between them , clenched into fists on his chest . She lets him hold her , but only fit- a moment . 111  | " Let 's go upstairs , " he says . " No . You go . He wants you . He wants somebody who 's going to accept everything he does . Without question , without criticism ... " " And you think that 's what I do ? " " I know it is ! " " I think , " he says cautiously , " that there might have been a better way to handle this . " " Oh , I 'm sure of it . " Her voice is bitter . " For openers , he could have come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , I meant tonight . " " I know what you meant ! You see ? Everything he does is all right ! Perfectly understandable ! And everything I d ? is is mixed up , and wrong , and could have been handled a better wav ! " " ' That 's not true ! That 's not what I 'm trying to say ! " I its nerves are raw . His eyes feel as if they have sunk hack into his head , pulling the flesh down . " Beth . Please . Let 's just go upstairs ! " " No ! I will not be pushed ! " she says . She moves away from him to stand before the window , looking out . Calmly she says , " I will not be manipulated . " He stands , looking over her head at the black window , then at the tree with its strings of lights dangling loose from the branches . Disjointed . Unfinished . " All right , " he says . " I 'm going . " She does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has heard him . Conrad lies face down on the bed , his body outlined in the light from the hall . One hand covers the back of his neck ; the other is limp at his side . Cal moves to the nightstand and snaps on the light . 112  | " I want to talk to you . " " I need to sleep , " he groans . His voice is muffled in the pillow . " Let me sleep . " " In a minute . " He pulls the chair over from the desk and sits beside the bed . Outside the window , heavy flakes of snow splatter and stick fast to the glass , sliding down to make miniature hills and valleys at the lower edge of the sill . " First . I give a damn , " he says , " about everything you do . " Conrad 's head jerks on the pillow . He rolls onto his back , shielding his eyes with his arm . " I did n't mean that , " he says . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Please . Do n't be mad . " " I 'm not mad , " Cal says . " I 'm just trying to figure out what happened down there . " " I do n't know what happened ! I do n't know ! I 'm sorry about everything ! I  --  look , ca n't we talk about it tomorrow , Dad , please ! I feel lousy tonight , everything is shit  --  Listen , I did n't mean to say any of that , you tell 11 her , will you ? Tell her I 'm sorry . " " Why do n't you tell her ? " " No ! God , I ca n't , I ca n't talk to her ! " " Why not ? " Abruptly he sits up , clasping his arms about his knees . his eyes are dry . There is a red crease along his cheek . IIe wipes his mouth nervously , staring at the window . " Because it wo n't make any difference . " " What do you mean ? " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she feels about me . " " The way she  --  Con , she was upset tonight . She was angry " No , I " do n't mean tonight . " 113  | " What , then ? " But he shakes his head . " No . I ca n't . Everything 's jello and pudding with you , Dad . I ca n't  --  you do n't see things ? " " What things ? " He continues to stare out the window at the snow , rocking slightly , back and forth , his arms clenched around his knees . " What things ? " Cal asks gently . " I want you to tell me . " His eyes flick over to Cal 's face ; instantly flick away . " All right , then . She hates me . There 's nothing I can do about it " ? I ! is voice is curt and flat  --  without hope . Something terribly wrong . He stares out the window , now , too , thinking of last year and Mr. Knight calling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something terribly wrong , here , Mr. Jarrett , a straight-A student dropping to l ) ' s and E 's in three months ' time . Most of the papers are not completed . Tests with half of the answer spaces blank , tests not handed in at all .... " Cal had asked him , " Why did n't you tell me you were in trouble ? " Conrad said , " I 'm not in trouble . I 'm passing , are n't I ? D is passing . " And he had tried to be gentle , knowing that something was terribly wrong . " It 's not a matter of passing , Con . Going from A to D like this , it does n't make sense . " And they had looked at each other over the words . What makes sense ? " Conrad , " he says , " that 's ridiculous . Your mother does not hate you ? " " Okay . All right , you 're right , I just  --  Please , let me go to bed , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stripping off his shirt . " What do you think of this Dr. Berger ? " Cal asks . He 114  | tries to keep his voice calm , neutral . " Do you think he 's helping you ? " " Dad , do n't blame it on Berger ! It is n't his fault . " He stands , facing the closet door . I le does not undress any further , and Cal knows he is waiting for him to leave . The snow , piled high against the windows , seals them inside its softness , its silence . 115  | Afterward . The hammer blows of guilt and remorse . He has no weapons with which to fight them off . No words of ' comfort , none of Berger 's advice applies . He has slandered her , to her face and behind her back . He has pushed everyone away who tries to help . If he could apologize . If he only could but they are no longer at home to him and it is not their fault . All his fault @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Evil . At school it is the same . Everywhere he looks , there is competence and good health . Only he , Conrad Jarrett , outcast , quitter , fuck-up , stands outside the circle of safety , separated from everyone by this aching void of loneliness ; but no matter , he deserves it . He does not speak to anyone . He does not dare to look his classmates in the eye . He does not want to contaminate , does not wish to find further evidence of his lack of worth . Music is his only escape . It makes the weight of his crimes bearable . The melody harmony rhythm a visible structure as it winds through his mind . He can concen- trate completely in here as they practice obscure French carols for the Christmas concert , and Faughnan , pushing all the time , ignoring all protests ? " Tenors ! Too heavy on the Everlasting ! ' And save the s ' for ' sting , ' will you ? Do n't be cute . Sopranos ! Screeching again , what am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch , for pete 's sake , watch ! " So he watches . He never takes his eyes off Faughnan the whole hour as the music fills out the corners of his mind . It is where all danger resides . Not the same as listening to his records at home . That is dangerous , also . Flipping through album covers gives an eerie feeling of time past , like last year 's calendar , carrying too much of the weight of Before . There is no possibility of a return to that period when he believed in the summer lyrics of John Denver , the easy philosophies . Seals and Crofts , Traffic , The Guess Who . And television . Merely ill bright patterns of color that jump around on the screen and do not soothe or settle his brain . He wonders what it would look like inside his brain . All brown and dusty from disuse . " Well , " Berger says , biting a corner of his thumbnail . " Quite a recitation . So , how cone you 're such a rot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at his hands . Ile has dreaded this session , knowing that t hey would end up talking about it , knowing that he no longer has control in here . Press a button ; out it comes . " I do n't know , " he says dully . " Ah , come on . Sure you do . " He gives him a fierce look . " I do n't know ! I , 00k , if you think you do , why do n't you tell we , and well quit going around in circles ! " 117  | " That 's what happens when you bury this junk , kiddo . It keeps resurfacing . Wo n't leave you alone . " " Crap , " he says . " I went off the deep end , that 's all . Jesus , now I sound like my grandfather . The deep end ! I just should n't have done it , it was stupid , it did n't make any sense . " " Nope . " Berger shakes his head . " There 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The stuff came out too strong , and now you wo n't let yourself buy any of it . The feelings are real enough . Trust that guy in the closet , will you ? " As an answer , he slides , resting the end of his spine on the seat of the chair , his legs outstretched . He stares at his hoots , at the lower edge of Merger 's desk , at the grainy patches of color in the rug . " Listen , Tuesday you felt great , did n't you  --  You went out for dinner , you bought a Christmas tree , everything 's okeydoke , am I right ? " " You 're the doctor . " Berger grins . " Hey . The doctor thinks the patient has a bad habit . He takes refuge . He throws out one-liners , like You 're the doctor . ' So , when does he start talking in French , huh ? I never took French . I would n't understand a word of that . That what you want ? See , kiddo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to pull the whole world in on top of you , it is only necessary to finish with Tuesday night . Everything 's fine until you up and have this fight with your mother . Then , everything 's lousy . A equals B. " He leans back in his chair , also , his hands behind his head . " So , have you tried to talk it out with her ? " " Jesus , no . " " Why not ? " " I ca n't . " " You sure ? "  | " Yeah , I 'm sure ! " " Have you tried ? " He does n't answer . " Tough to be sure if you have n't tried . " " Listen , you do n't know her . She  --  it 's impossible . Not that I blame her  --  I do n't blame her . I mean , she 's got reasons . After all the shit I 've pulled ? " " What shit have you pulled ? " He looks down at his hands . " Come on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to come up with at least one example , huh ? " " Okay , " he says . " All right . Once I tried to kill myself , how 's that ? " " That , " Berger says , " is an old turkey . I am talking about what have you done lately . " " Lately ! Listen , if you  --  listen ! I am never going to be forgiven for that , never ! You ca n't get it out , you know ! All that blood on her rug and her goddamn towels ? everything had to be pitched ! Even the goddamn tile in the bathroom had to be regrouted . Christ , she fired a goddamn maid because she could n't ( lust the living room right , and if you think she 's ever going to forgive one ? " He stops , staring at Berger , whose eyebrows are raised in mild surprise , his body sitting motionless in the chair . The wave of anger recedes slowly , leaving a tightness , a burning sensation in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lungs , clenching his fists on his thighs , breathing slowly . Ile gets up from the chair , moves to the window , and stares down at the curls of slush in the street ; at the cars creeping by behind a curtain of gray winter rain . Behind him he hears Berger get up ; pour himself another cup of coffee . He turns his head to watch him . " I think I just figured something out , " he says . 119  | " What 's that ? " Berger asks . " Who it is who ca n't forgive who . " Reclining on an elbow on the floor , Berger doodles on a scratch pad with his silver pen . Conrad sits beside him , his back against the wall , knees up , holding a cup of coffee in his hands . " Jesus , am I tired , " he says . " Yeah , well , that 's a helluva big secret you 've been keeping on yourself , " Berger says . " So what do I do now ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? Revelation . She 's not perfect . Recognize her limitations . " " You mean , like she ca n't love me . " ' ' Like she ca n't love you enough . Like she loves you its much as she 's able .. Perspective , kiddo , remember ? las be she 's afraid , maybe it 's hard for her to give love . " No , " he says . " It is n't . She loves my father , I know that . " lie closes his eyes . " She loved my brother , too . It 's just me . " " Ah , now we 're back to the old rotten-kid routine . She does n't love you because you 're unlovable . So where does that leave your dad ? How come he loves you ? Does n't he know what a rotten kid you are ? " " That 's different . He feels responsible . Besides , he loves everybody . " " Oh , I get it , the guy 's got no taste . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiddo , you keep asking the same old questions , but you only listen for the one answer . Give yourself a break , why do n't you ? Let yourself off the hook . " " What d' you mean ? " " I mean , there 's somebody else you got ta forgive . " " You mean me ? What for ? For the other night , you mean ? For trying to off myself ? " 120  | The eyes have pinned him to the wall . A hard blue light . He shifts uncomfortably . " I have n't done anything else , " he says . " I have n't . " The beams switch to low , and Berger smiles benignly . " Okay . You have n't . " He gets to his feet and finishes the last of his coffee . " This stuff 's rotten , you know that ? " " Damn right . Otherwise , I 'd be up to my ass in patients . Listen , be aware , kiddo . People do n't change on command from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already given her the ultimate command a year ago . " A hair trigger of release , waiting to be sprung . No more , no more , he is too tired . " That is n't why I did it , " he says . " No ? Why , then ? " Nearly time . Nearly five o'clock , and he is exhausted . Even his bones ache . " I do n't know , " he says . " The body does n't lie , " Berger says . " You remember that . So all you got ta do is keep in touch . " 121  | " Now , this is what I call a real Christmas , " says Howard . " Snowing to beat the band , a turkey in the oven , a real live tree  --  a lot better than having dinner in some hotel in Florida , right ? " Beth smiles at him . " Anyone care for a drink ? " Cal asks . " I would , " says Ellen . " A small glass of wine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting next to Beth on the couch . They look more like sisters than mother and daughter . Ellen 's hair is thick and silvery , cut short , and waved expertly to flatter the thin , aging face . Her body is slim and firm . It is easy to see where Beth gets her looks . " Where 's Connie ? " " Upstairs . He 's coming . Howard , scotch ? " " Fine . " " Beth ? " " No , thanks . Not right now . " " Beth 's got a dinner to put on , " Howard booms . " We  | ca n't have the hostess dipping into the sauce too early , can we ? " No comparing this with Florida . Last Christmas there had been the arranging of hotel reservations and flight schedules and tickets for the Orange Bowl . Last Christmas they had played golf and gone deep-sea fishing and tanned themselves beside the aquamarine blue of the swimming pool at the Sonesta Beach , looking at other people from the distance of delirium . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And each day opened to a scene more beautiful than the last : palm fronds , like upside-down green bowls under an upside-down blue bowl of sky . Lagoons full of lazy jumping fish . White sand that clung to their bodies like confectioner 's sugar . Australian pine trees and sea grape . Lord , how he had hated it . Like medicine you took , knowing that it had no power to heal . A relief to come back to the cold and gray reality of a Chicago winter . " Hi . Merry Christmas . " " Same to you , dear ! " Ellen holds out her arrns and Conrad goes to her ; he bends his head obediently for a kiss . He is dressed up today  --  tan slacks and a tan , bulkyknit pullover , his boots polished  --  a concession to his mother ? He looks healthy . His cheeks are flushed . The ugly rash is nearly gone . " You did a great job on this tree , " Howard says . " I hear it was all your idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " About a month of Sundays . " Something is different about him lately . The smile is a good kid-grin , with his eyes into it . He looks handsome , that 's it , with those long , thick eyelashes , like a girl 's . The build is all boy , though  --  all angles , elbows , and knees . 123  | Howard rubs his palms together briskly . " Let 's get this show on the road , folks ! " They exchange glances , he and Conrad ; then they look away . Cal is reminded of the game they used to play : Grandfather Trivia . " What does he say after a horseshoe ringer ? " " That 's one for the good guys ! " " What time does he get up in the morning ? " " At the crack o'dawn ! " " When will he eat liver ? " " When hell freezes over ! " Jordan had invented it , with his eye for detail , his unmerciful memory . And another game . Nicknames . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ( is grandfather , the Kid , his grandmother , the ( : itl Friend . " I ! ere conies the Kid in the Mercedes , he 's got the Girl Friend with him ! " A blessing That you do not know at the moment of impact how far reaching the . shock waves will be . He is at once achingly aware of the force of Jordan 's absence . Only a year and a half . Still , it is a long time to discover that you are still in shock , still in the infant stages of recovery . Surrounded by gifts , Conrad , anxious giver , seeks reassurance . " You really like it , Grandmother ? " She holds up the candle , apple-shaped and scented with apple , for all to admire . " Like it ? I love it , it smells delicious . " " And the gloves fit okay ? " " Perfect , " says Howard . " Like a glove , " Cal says . His mood is buoyant , expectant . Patiently he listens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the golf book he has bought for him ; it is guaranteed to cut six strokes from his game . " Then , I 'd better not catch you reading it before me ! " he warns him happily . 124  | For his mother , Conrad has picked out a bracelet of silver ; fragile , delicate links that loop over and tinder each other , like figure-eights on a glassy pond . " I hope you like it , " he says . " It 's beautiful , " she says . " It 's lovely . Thank you . " They are polite and careful with each other these days . The mood of the house is subdued and calm . A truce of some kind has been effected . Cal , the fumbling , uncertain negotiator , has stayed out of it . A cooling-off period must be observed . It is not his way at all ; he is all for plunging in , taking people by the shoulders , shaking them into submission , into daylight . But he can not bully either of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this way . All healing is done from the outside in . " Hey , is n't there another present down there ? " How-ard asks . Conrad leans over , searching among shirts and sweaters , a navy ski-vest , a pen-and-pencil set ; he comes up with a small package , wrapped in silver paper . " No card . Who 's it from ? " Cal says , " It 's from your mother and me. " jII He opens it . Glittering on the nest of white cotton , is a key ring , with two keys on it . Howard nudges Cal in the ribs . He has been like a kid with this , calling Cal on the telephone , checking on the details  --  How would they present it ? Where will they keep it over the long Christmas weekend ? He drove to the dealership with Cal to pick it up ; has kept it in his garage for nearly a week . Now he can not hide the smile on his face . " Well ? Why do n't you go look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . The green LeMans with its a white vinyl top is parked at a jaunty angle in the drive . Howard has wired a huge red bow to the door handle . 125  | " Sneaky , huh ? " he crows . " Dad , I think we fooled him good this time . He looks like we could knock him over with a feather about now ! " True . He stands next to Cal on the porch , as they all admire the car , glittering under a light coat of fresh snow . His expression is totally blank and unreadable , but Cal reads anyway : I do n't think he likes it . " How about the color ? " Howard asks . " You like it ? " " They had it in a pale gold , " Cal says . " You might have liked that better . " " No . This is great . " He looks at Cal , then , a smile pasted on his face . He seems dazed . " I like it a lot . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that 's all . " " Cot ' out license on you ? " I toward asks . " Take it for a spin " " No , " he . says . Then , " Yeah , okay . I think I will . Thanks . Thank you both , it 's beautiful , really . It 's terrific ? . And he gets in ; it starts up smoothly . It glides smoothly out of the driveway , and Cal , resisting the urge to call , " Take it easy ! " or any other of those goodluck charms , thinks , He will be careful . He will take it easy , even though he has not driven in nearly a year , because he is a good driver . He will take care because of that , and not because of anything that I yell at him . " Well , " says Howard . " What a surprise , huh ? I do n't think he quite knew what to make of it . " Beth and Ellen have already gone inside . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; makes him feel shrunken , and old . " I think he liked it , though , " Howard says . " A kid 's first car . Always a big deal , right ? " " Right , " Cal says . " Yeah , I remember when you gave him that twowheeler . God , he loved that thing , did n't he ? Rode it 126  | around the block all day . When was that ? " He holds the door for Cal . " Kids . They sure do grow up in a hurry , do n't they ? " And so it had gone wrong . The neat , even pieces of the day have somehow slipped awry . Disengaged . Ile sits alone on the couch , his head back , his feet on the coffee table . He has driven Howard and Ellen home , and Conrad is upstairs in bed , asleep . Beth has cleared the dessert plates from the table and is busy with them in the kitchen . He stares out of the window at the snow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Colored stars in a white sky . Something was missing something terribly wrong , but it was not just the car . It was the whole day . Well , what do you expect ? We are a family , are n't we ? And a family turns inward toward itself in grief it does not go in separate directions , pulling itself apart . Like hell it does n't . Grief is ugly . It is isolating . It is not something to be shared with others , it is something to be afraid of to get rid of and fast . Get those months , days , hours , minutes out of the way , it ca n't be quick enough . He gets up to make himself a drink at the bar , and Beth comes in from the kitchen . She looks tired ; her face set , her mind occupied elsewhere . We should have gone to London , he thinks . Aloud , he asks , " Would you like anything ? " " No . I 'm tired . I think I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he should n't , knowing somehow that it will only disarrange the contours of the day more thoroughly , still he says it : " I guess he did n't like the car . She is silent . " Did he ? "  | " I think , " she says , " you worry too much about him . " " Yeah . " And I think that you do n't worry enough , but let it go , call it a very merry rugged Christmas Day , and let it go . " And you expect too much . From all of us . " He takes a healthy swallow of his drink . " Uh huh . That sounds like the beginning of a lecture . What 's it for ? I thought I behaved myself pretty well today . " " You want us all to perform for you , " she says . " Make the day go right for you ? " " Well , I 'm willing to do my share . I 'll sing and dance and tell crooked-lawyer jokes  --  it wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , either ! Or Dad 's or Mother 's ! You did n't have to close up on them that way , just because your surprise did n't work out the way you planned it . " " I did n't close up . What 're you talking about ? " " Yes , you did . You moped and pouted around here , as if your whole day was spoiled over that one thing . " Okay , I moped , I pouted . All right . I give up . Uncle . He leans his elbows on the bar , his back to her . " I 'm tired of you getting your feelings hurt , Cal , because you refuse to see things as they really are . " " And how are things ? " he asks , turning around . " How are they really ? " She is so lovely , so lovely . That white skin and the pale , lavender silk of the dress , the honeyed hair , loose about her face . What are we fighting about ? " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 'll be eighteen years old next month . For some reason , you want to think he needs your constant concern and protection .

" 128  | " Oh , I hate you , " she says . " Sometimes I really hate you when you get that look on your face . Why could n't you see this was the way it would work out if we stayed here this year ? " " At last ! " he says . " Down to basics ! Listen , if my day was spoiled , it was because I had that hanging over my head , so I 'm sorry , okay ? I 'm sorry I did n't take you to London ! " " Are you sorry about giving him a car he did n't want , and does n't need ? Sorry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could have told you would never happen ? " They look at each other , and he wants to say , But that 's not it , do n't you see ? At least , not all of it . And he knows as she turns away from him , going back to the kitchen , and moments later , there is the familiar and purposeful hum of the dishwasher , that the day has not gone the way she planned it , either . They are both disappointed . They are both grieving . And he thinks about going upstairs ; thinks about passing Conrad 's door , going down the hall to their bedroom , where they will silently undress , and separately grieve . And what about tomorrow then ? And all the tomorrows to come ? Why ca n't we talk about it ? Why ca n't we ever talk about it ? 129  | He has concluded , on this crisp and sunny day in January that what his life lacks is Organization . Goals . Standing at his desk , his foot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pondering , making rapid notes . 1 . Finals Essential that he pass . Above all else . Only two weeks left in the semester . One last push and study like hell . 2 . Exercise Not enough in the last months . In fact , nothing , except for gym . His skis , lying dusty and neglected at the back of his closet , reproach him each morning . Someday after school he will drive to Wilmot , take a lesson , maybe . Grab a sandwich , ski some more . Be home by eleven . No . Not something to do alone pointless unless you have somebody to do it with . In the warming room afterward scanning the crowd for a familiar face . No. 3 . Friends He is definitely in need . The worst thing about the  | hospital . An absolute lack of privacy . People crowding you , pressuring you , examining and reassuring . Never alone . Now . Excess turns virtue into vice . He finds each day as he looks around him that he is achingly lonely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genthe . No . He is not ready for them and anyway they are all seniors now , thinking about graduation and not interested in their old buddy , Jarrett . Besides , their old buddy , Jarrett , no longer exists . He is extinct . Someone else , now . Needing new friends . But how ? 4 . Job ( ? ) Doing what ? Yard work ? ( It is January , kiddo . ) Volunteer work ? Not too likely , somebody needing him . Oh , yeah ? Why the hell not ? There are plenty of things he could do for other people . Maybe the placement office could give him some suggestions , or he could call organizations , the Red Cross , the Foundation for the Blind , put some thought into it , some imagination . He sits down , suddenly , looking out of his window again at the tall cedars , the bare gray limbs of maples and olive trees , at Heather , the Cahills ' big , black Lab , nosing under bushes , scratching herself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; fuzzy and slightly out of focus , no , wait a minute , wait a minute , it is not out of focus . It is clear and sharp , distinct , in place . His whole life is in place and it spreads out around him , steady and full of purpose . A mystic source of energy , flooding his body , his mind , all at once . Joy . He wants to go off in every direction at the same time . Swiftly he notes : 5 . Guitar 6 . Books 7 . Girls A million years ago , when they were both sixteen , he 131  | and Lazenby discussed the topic daily ; compared notes on their Experience . They concluded that they had none . For him , nothing has changed . He remembers Bernard Renaldi , a kid in his freshman comp class , relating his triumph : he had kissed a hundred girls on New Year 's Eve . The sheer volume of it had staggered their minds . So , how many girls has C. Jarrett kissed ? How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year and a half ? Karen . Suzanne Mosely .

For now , he is too fillet ) with this good feeling , too filled with himself to care , and he jttitt1 ) 1 ult , goes to the closet , looking for his guitar  --  it 's hack there somewhere  --  but can he still play it ? Sure , it 's like riding a bicycle , you do n't forget . And tomorrow he will go to the library for books on what ? Anything . Everything . He wants to learn everything , know everything . Lists . Buck used to find the scraps of notes on his desk ; those stern , written commands to himself to shape up . He would cop them and they would show up , folded inside his napkin at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The Great Listmaker is at it again , folks ! " he would tease him . Reverting to old ways ? does that signify a moving backward , or forward ? The natural , sane ticking inside him eliminates all need of an answer . Standing in an aisle in the library , he can feel the eyes on him . He turns his head to look . A pretty , dark-haired 132 Standing in an aisle in the library , he can feel the eyes on him . He turns his head to look . A pretty , dark-haired  | woman . Staring at him . Guiltily , he looks away . Should he know her ? Someone 's mother , maybe ? One of his friends ? No , too young . Well dressed , nice figure , nice legs . He takes another look , and she is still watching him , her head tilted in an attitude of appraisal . He moves to the next aisle , as embarrassment and l anger work within him , giving way then , to the familiar cloak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A one-man side show , carrying the mysterious label ; of brand . What is this about him ? Still . People should n't do that . Stick somebody like a bug on the head of a pin and stare like that . And he should n't do it to himself , either . It is disgusting . Also , boring . He takes down a book and blindly reads until the words begin grouping together , forming small patterns of reason , of sense . The feeling of joy exists , he knows it now . It must exist outside the sterile medium of his bedroom , too . It has to be wider than the dimensions of his window , and never mind all the people who pigeonhole other people with their cracks , their amused , superior smiles . He checks out his books . The librarian slips his plastic credit card into the machine . Even the library is run like a department store now . The whole world is one , big Department Store , one big Computer , but never mind . They still might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small and wispy . Her washed-out blue eyes will not pierce or injure him .

Oh , yes , they do take on part-time help occasionally . However , they are fully staffed right now , but if he would like to fill out an 133  | application ? Yes , he would like to . She gets him a form , and he begins to fill it out at the counter , but she waves him away . That 's all right , just bring it with you sometime when you come . So much for 4 . A Job . Ah Jarrett attaboy just like you to give it all up after one try how about the volunteer work how about the placement office all the things you were going to do  --  And how about lacks ? 1 .

She glances over her shoulder . " Oh , sorry . " Then , she straightens up . He has caught her of guard , but she is still more poised than he , and this close he can see her face : small , delicate features , the casual elegance of a painter or a dancer , a beautiful pointed nose . She smooths her hair back from her face . " I embarrassed you in there , did n't I ? I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very good-looking . But I 'm sure you already know that . " She closes the door on the passenger side , moving around him , around her car , to get in on the driver 's side . The car starts up and she backs out , carefully , in no hurry at all . She waits in the drive for the traffic to clear , then pulls out into the street and disappears . He stands , looking after her , his books still under his arm , while a feeling of total displacement sweeps over 134  | him . Mechanically he opens the door ; tosses his books on the seat ; gets in . You 're very good-looking . Observing meticulously all traffic signs , all other cars on the road , all pedestrians , being careful , missing no turns . He arrives home safe and intact , and parks in the circular II drive so that his father can put his car in the garage . He enters the house through the door in the garage . His mother 's car is still missing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ straight upstairs to his bedroom , without taking off his jacket ; drops his books on the bed ; goes into the bathroom and turns on the light . You 're very good-looking . But I 'm sure you already know that . He studies his face in the mirror . Heavy , dark brows and brown eyes . A nose . A mouth . Right , everything there . His hair , clean and decently cut at last ; his skin , clear . God , his skin is clear , when did that happen ? How long has it been since he looked at himself ? He turns on a foolish , fake smile . Another plus . Straight , even teeth . An outside chance . That she is right . He turns off the light and goes to sit on the edge of the bed . The freak , the one-man side show answer no longer fits . So , what is the catch ? Some danger he is not yet aware of ? What will he have to pay for all of this , for thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands over his head , staring at the ceiling . Whatever the price , it is worth it . Even for ten minutes , it is worth it . " So , then what happened ? " Berger asks . " C'm on , I 'm spellbound . You followed her home and she took you into her bed , right ? " " Not exactly . " 135  | He takes a bite of the sweet roll he has lifted from the bakery box on the floor next to him . " She drove away , and I went home . I told you not to get your hopes up . " Berger sits like a plump guru , legs folded under him . There are flecks of powdered sugar dotting the front of his sweater . " Anyway , " Conrad asks anxiously , " what d' you think ? She 's probably some woman who goes around saying stuff like that to guys all the time , huh ? " " Do I know ? " Berger raises palms upward , flashing a sly smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that to guys who are hideously ugly You know , to make ' en- feel better about themselves " " Okay " I le hanks his head smartly against the wall . " You wo n't take it serious , your Toss . " " I take it serious ! I want to know something else . What happened when you looked in the mirror ? No censoring voices ? " " Not at first . Then , later on I heard , Conceited , fantasizing , delusions of grandeur , ' stuff like that . I ignored it . " Berger laughs . " There 's hope for you yet , kiddo . " He shifts position , brushing the sugar from his sweater . " So , how you feeling now ? About Christmas . About the car . " " Better , I guess , " he says . " I drive it , do n't I ? " " You still think it commits you to something ? " " Sort of . Like a bribe . There , now be happy . ' " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy ? " " Yeah , but I do n't want him depending on me for it . What if I ca n't live up to it ? What if it 's a temporary thing ? " " Ah , he does n't seem like the type who asks for the impossible , kiddo . He does n't expect you to be happy every minute of the day , does he ? He 'd probably settle 136  | for an hour or two a week . And maybe his big motive was a selfish one . You 're his kid . He gets a kick out of giving you presents . No big contract , just Merry Christmas . Period . " " Yeah , maybe . " He considers . " It takes a long time to get over the feeling that everybody 's watching all the time . " He clears his throat . His eyes are fixed on the desk in front of him . " Listen , there 's something else I 've been wanting to talk about . " In a careful monotone , he relates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that the world has suddenly become overpopulated with them and with their individual parts  --  breasts and legs and round-apple asses that he would like to fit his hands around . The day Lenore Phillips slid silkily into the desk beside his and he had gotten a hard-on that lasted halfway through the English period . Violent urges that entrap him each morning and each night and for which he knows only one cure . Afterward , he suffers the most intense spasms of raw and painful guilt . " Is that it ? " Berger asks . " Listen , I told you , it 's a tension-reducer . And it 's normal , do n't worry about it . It 's also a sign that you 're waking up , so relax , will you ? You know what I think you ought a do ? Call somebody up . How about that girl you know from the hospital ? The one who lives in Skokie ? " " Karen , " he says . " No . I have n't seen her since November . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me away with . It 'd just bother her if I called her up " " Baloney . It 's gon na bother her  --  a good-looking guy like you wanting to see her ? A guy that women proposition in library parking lots ? " He laughs . " I thought psychiatrists were n't supposed to give advice . " 137  | " Or how about the one in choir ? She sounds like a nice girl ? " " The problem is , " he says , " the only dates I ever had were the All-skate type . A bunch of us getting together and going to the show , or getting a pizza after a basketball game . Nobody was with anybody else . I do n't know how to act , you know , with A Girl , one-to-one . " " Simple , " Berger says , grinning . " Listen to the expert . It 's just like skiing . The first few times , you close your eyes and fake it , hope for the best . " " That 's crap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , there are a million rules . " Berger sighs . " Rules , again . They ought a burn every rule book that 's e'er been written ! " And where would we be ? .. " Out of the box ! " I le shakes his fists at the ceiling , in a parody of rage . ' Thatt box , " he says . " I feel like I 've been in it forever . Everybody looking in , to see how you 're doing . Even when they 're on your side , they 're still looking in . Like , nobody can get in there with you . " " Yeah . Not much fun , is it ? " " No . But sometimes I can get out of it , now . And then , there 's you . " He clears his throat nervously . " I never saw you out there , you know ? You , I always saw inside the box . With me . " He laughs , suddenly embarrassed . His face is hot . He brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ books , daring them to move from the shelves , daring the windows to shatter . " What I 'm saying . . . I guess I think of you as a friend . " There is movement at the edge of his eye . Berger , nodding . " Well . I think of you as mine , too , kiddo . " " You do n't have to say that . " 138  | " Right . I do n't . So , I would n't . " They look at each other , and , abruptly , he relaxes , grinning . " You understand , there were n't a helluva lot of people standing in line . " " Good , " Berger says . " I hate competition . " 139  | He finishes tying the last bundle of newspapers ; small , portable piles to be carried out to the street on Monday , garbage-pickup day . He gives the knot a yank ; cuts off the ends evenly with a paring knife . " Some birthday present , " Conrad says , leaning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust settles around them . " Come on , do n't be a crybaby . How long did it take ? An hour ? " " One whole hour out of my birthday , when I ought a be blowing out candles , opening presents ? " " Finish the sweeping , then tell me your sad story . " He goes inside to make lunch for the two of them ; rummages in the refrigerator , pulling out salami , cheese , tomatoes , lettuce , mustard , mayonnaise . Two cans of beer . Conrad comes in as he finishes assembling the goods on thick , dark slices of rye bread . " No mayonnaise on mine , okay ? "  | " Oh , hell ? " " All right , forget it . I 'll eat it . " He grins . " Jesus , what a birthday ! " He sits at the table , drumming lightly on it with his fingers . " Thought I heard you playing the guitar last night . " " Yeah . Am I rusty . " " Sounded good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always easy to please . " " No , uh uh . Not me . Good guitar player , lousy garage cleaner , that 's my opinion . " He picks up his beer . " Happy birthday ! " " Thanks . " The beer slides , golden and cool , down the back of his throat . " I used to have to keep an eye on both of you , whenever we did that job , " he says . " Could n't give you anything to put away inside the house , or I 'd never see you again . Buck , especially . He was a genius at getting out of work . " " Yeah , I remember . " " In fact , the only time he worked his tail off was when we finished the rec room . Remember the plastering job we did down there ? You guys wrote dirty words on the wall , and then gave it away , laughing so hard ? " " They 're still there , " Conrad says . " What ? " " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went upstairs . Come on , I 'll show you . " And they head for the basement , Conrad leading the way to the room that is Cal 's pride ; he had designed it all himself ; the three of them had finished it together . Dark Tudor beams in the ceiling ; flat boards in an Xpattern on the walls , and between it they had slapped on the thick , curling plaster with their hands . In a corner near the furnace room , Conrad shows Cal the up-141  | side-down obscenities , carefully printed and preserved . And , another memory slips out , then , of himself , lying on the sand at the beach while Buck and Con are building a sand sculpture . The sleek lines emerge and he sees the outline of a huge race car . When they leave , he goes to view it ; sees , instead the flaring hips and generously mounded breasts of a giant woman , stretching seductively at his feet . " Sex ! " he shouts . " Maniacs ! " and , behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , smiling . There is pressure behind his eyes , and the blood is beating in his head . They go upstairs and finish eating lunch . Cal is busy , filling out this Saturday in his mind . A cake , a few presents , nothing fancy this time , nothing big . They will go to I toward and Ellen 's because she makes a big deal over birthdays . She always has felt sorry for Con , as his comes so close to Christmas . Conrad is whistling ; drumming again on the table . " You 're in a good mood today , " Cal observes . " You like being eighteen , do you ? " He laughs . " Yeah , I guess so . " " Tell me something , " he says . " You and this Dr. Berger , what do you guys talk about ? " He shrugs ; looks surprised . " Anything . I do n't know . Why ? " " Just curious . What kinds of things ? " " Whatever we feel like . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a lot of jargon . Once in a while he gives a little lecture ? " he leans back in the chair , hands on his thighs , in imitation : " Perspective , kiddo , that 's the key word ? ' " " What would you think , " Cal says , " if I were to go and talk with him ? " 142  | " What for ? About me , you mean ? " " No . Just  --  I do n't know . To get a few things straight in my own mind . " Conrad sets his beer down ; says with finality , " There 's nothing wrong with you , Dad . " " Nice . How do you know ? " " You fishing ? You want a grade ? Okay , I give you a B plus . " " That 's great , " Cal says . " I buy you a new car , teach you everything I know  --  how to play tennis , how to clean a garage , I let you beat me at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus , that 's great . " Conrad laughs . " So , I 'm a hard marker . " " Anyway it is n't important . Just an idea I had . " " See him if you want to , I do n't care . It 's okay with me . " But , do I want to ? Why do I want to ? What 's happening ? Nothing is happening , except that now he is imagining . A peculiar , stiff set to Conrad 's shoulders when she speaks to him . But , does she speak to him ? She issues directives : " Wear the sweater your grandparents gave you for Christmas , " she says , walking out of the room without waiting for , without having any interest in his reply . And Conrad is cool to her , cool as he lowers his head in a mocking bow : " Yes , ma'am . No , ma'am . " As for himself , he feels undercurrents at work : tremors in the earth . Last night , when they made love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in sex ) , she let him hold her afterward , whispering against his shoulder : " You have n't been very friendly , lately . " " Friendly ? " he said . " I 'm always friendly . " " Please . " A silky rush of breath against his face . " I need you to love me , Cal ! Please promise ! " " I love you , Beth . God , you know that . " But he could 143  | not hold her tightly enough ; she clung to him urgently as he stroked her hair , and he was obscurely frightened , because it was not like her , and because he felt beneath them a fault , imperceptibly widening , threatening . Drifting into sleep , he lost his balance , tipping backward again into memory . A Saturday morning in October , when Jordan was thirteen . Michigan playing Northwestern . They had planned to go to the game with Nancy and Ray , and Jordan had broken his arm playing football on the front lawn . In the back seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hospital , the two brothers had sat , side by side , and he had turned around to scold them.He had been annoyed at having to miss the game , at the prospect of spending his whole afternoon at the hospital while hock got X-rays and a cast , and he had said , " I 'm beginning to think you 're accidentprone , you know it ? " Meth had leveled a look at him : Not now , you idiot ! Buck , his arm held awkwardly in front of him , asked , " How was I supposed to know the kid would fall on me ? " " That 's what tackle is , is n't it ? I 've told you kids a hundred times , that game 's too rough without equipment ! Touch , okay ; but not tackle ! " " Dad , we promise , we do n't do it again . " But it had been Conrad , shaken and scared who answered him , not Buck . Buck had never worried about anything . " Coffee ? " " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , tries to relax . God , he has never been so nervous . He surveys the room : its windows are oil-streaked ; cloudy with dirt . An overpowering air of disorder dominates , weighs him 144  | down . The bookcases are tightly packed with dark , musty-looking volumes . The man sitting across from him has a wild look : Primitive Man . His hair is a dark and fuzzy halo about his head ; his eyes , a sharp , stinging blue . All the jokes , the stereotypes of psychiatrists flood his mind : they are mad , their children are mad . I le knew a boy at Michigan , studying psychiatry , who had gone berserk in the dorm one night and cut up all of his clothes , stabbed his mattress , screaming that Eisenhower had called him person-to-person from Washington , telling him to do it . An absurd memory . It has nothing to do with this man . Yet all of his reactors are at work  --  summing up , evaluating , rejecting . He shifts uneasily in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says . Berger laughs . " Okay . What do I do now ? Disappear in a puff of smoke ? " " I did n't mean that . I meant that I do n't believe in psychiatry . As a blanket . A panacea for everybody , you know ? " " Okay , " Berger says . " Me neither . " Helpful . Trying to be friendly . Only , he is too strange , too alien . Cal stares at the overcrowded , sloping bookshelves , reminded suddenly of a professor that he had in law school , whose briefcase bulged with books , scraps of notes , impedimenta that spewed forth whenever he opened it in class . That first year , the briefcase haunted him ; reminded him of the inner caverns of his own mind , adrift in terrible disorganization . " I 'm not putting you down , " he says . " Or what you 've done for him . He 's better , I can see that . " " Well , he 's working at it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew something was wrong , " he says . " Even before . But I always thought 145  | I mean , he 's very smart . He 's been an all-A student since he started school . I just always thought that intelligent people could work out their own problems .... " He fixes the bookshelves with a stern look . " These books , " he says , " are they all about treating people ? " " No . Not all . " He looks down at his hands , clenched into fists on his knees . " I wish , " he says , " that I knew what the hell I was doing here . " " I could use an objective opinion on my coffee , " Berger says . " Your son tells me it 's lousy . " " Yes . All right . " He gets up and goes to the table in the corner . " I 'm getting a feeling from you , " he says , " of heavy guilt . Ahout missing the signals . Am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " sure . " It is easier now that Berger 's bark is to him . I le had n't realized it was the eyes that were un-king him nervous . " You do n't have something like that happen and not feel the responsibility . " " Guilt . " " Guilt . Yes . " He takes the cup Berger is holding out . " Well , I 'm guilty . And lucky , too . I was there at the right time . I could have been at a meeting , we could have both been at meetings . " " Your wife was there , too ? " " Yes . " Banging on the door , begging to be let in , while Beth called for an ambulance : directed her over his shoulder . " So , you think of yourself as a lucky man . " " No , I would n't say so . Not any more . I used to , before ? before the accident . " Then his voice shifts , cuts through the film of the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hell , all life is accident ,  | every bit of it  --  who you fall in love with , what grabs you , and what you do with it .... " " That sounds more like the philosophy of a drifter than a tax attorney from Lake Forest , " Berger says . " Okay , I 'm a drifter , " he says . " I 'm drifting now . I can see myself  --  I see both of them , drifting away from me while I stand there , watching . And I do n't know what to do about it . " " What do you want to do about it ? " " Nothing ! I do n't want to do anything but sit here on the fence . Until I fall off . On one side or the other . " Berger sips his coffee . " You see them on opposite sides of the fence , is that it ? " " Yes , " he says . " No . I do n't know . " Berger nods . He strokes his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I see her , " Cal says , " not being able to forgive him . " " For what ? " He shrugs . " For surviving , maybe . No , that 's not it , for being too much like her . Hell , I do n't know . She 's like a watercolor . They 're hard to look at , watercolors . You disappear in them sometimes . And after , you do n't know where you 've been , or what 's happened ? " Abruptly he snaps his gaze back inside the room . " I do n't know what the hell I 'm talking about . I 'm not a drifter . I 'm not on any fence . I 'm not any of those things . Except maybe a lousy husband and father . " " Ah . " Berger nods . " Well , maybe rotten sons deserve lousy fathers . Yours tells me Tuesdays and Fridays what a rotten kid he is . " " He should n't . It is n't true . " " He comes by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friendly , invites him to relax , and he wants so much to do it . He leans back in the chair , rubbing his face with his 147  | hands . " He used to call the hospital the Zoo . I asked him if coming to see you was like going to the Zoo , but he said no , it was more like the Circus . " Berger laughs . " That 's either a compliment , " he says , " or damn poor PR , I do n't know which . " He takes a deep breath ; the first since he has entered the office . " I think I know why I came here . I think I really came to talk about myself . " " Okay , " Berger says . " Why do n't we do that ? " 148  | Exam week . The first day dawns , sunny and below zero . His car barely has time to warm up before he pulls it into the school parking lot . He leaves it unlocked . Someone might want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , who knows ? English . On Miss Mellon 's desk is a stack of plain white paper , and next to it , the sheets of exam questions . She has written , in her spiky , up-and-down handwriting across the chalkboard : RELAX . NO BIG DEAL . Nice . She really is a nice person . He sits down near the door and glances out of the window . Shadows of trees , blue on the snow . Everything glittering out there . She has not been trying to smother him , after all ; just trying to be nice . Do n't get distracted ! He looks around the room at the rest of the class : Joel Marks , Buzz Fayton , Neva Welles sitting dutifully hunched over their papers on three sides of him . The room is thick with the silence of concentration . He looks down at the sheet of ques-tions : 1 .  | 2 . Discuss Hardy 's view of Man 's control over his inner/outer environment , using Jude the Obscure as example . 3 . Are the characters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness ? Support your theory . 4 . What is Conrad 's viewpoint , as illustrated in Lord Jim , concerning action and consequence ? Suggested time limit : 40 minutes per question . Automatically , he takes out a pencil , even though his mind has gone stubbornly , soddenly blank . Well , that 's that . ' I'hro . lousy questions to sum up one semester 's work . What does he have to say about them ? Nothing . I to has road the hooks . Period . Miss Mellon passes by his desk , and her skirt brushes the edge of it lightly . During A lunch each day she sits with Mr. Provosky , the algebra teacher . They lean toward each other across the table . Miss Mellon 's hands form neat , geometric shapes in the air when she talks . Probably explaining to him how Jude Fawley was powerless in the grip of circumstances . Yeah , probably . He keeps his head down . He needs his virtue intact this morning . She is one of the females whose bodies he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is waking up ? He shudders . Not today . Please . Concentrate , damn you , Jarrett . He has read the books . Okay , so he is no further behind , no less equipped than anybody else in here . " Relax , " she says . Okay . Okay . At his locker he collects the books he needs for his chemistry exam on Thursday . He notices , then is no-150  | ticed by a group of girls at the end of the hall . Someone calls out , " Hi . " He waves ; out of the corner of his eye he sees them heading for the exit doors . All but one of them . Jeannine . She shrugs into her coat , tying a scarf firmly about her head . God , if she should come down this way ! He has not spoken to her since they Caine back from Christmas vacation . He wonders now , why he ever put 7 . Girls on the list . To frustrate himself , for sure . Girl would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ; she is gone . Nice going kiddo . Another opportunity missed . So easy , too . She was by herself ; no one to see or hear him stammer around  --  Ha . No one but her . This is worse than any exam . He stares fixedly into his locker , wasting precious seconds ; then he slams it closed , locking it in one lightning motion , and sprints down the hall . He bursts through the first set of double doors , breathless . She is standing in the tiny , overheated lobby , pulling on her gloves , her books balanced on the radiator . " Hi . " He sets his books next to hers as he zips his jacket . " Hi . " Cool and reserved . And rightly so . Exactly what has he to offer someone like her ? Someone with directions , goals , interests . " What did you have today ? " " History . You ? " " English , " he says . " It was n't too bad . How was yours ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He grins at her . She smiles . He opens the door for her and the air hits them , a wall of piercing cold . She shivers , gripping her books tightly . " ' Bye . See you . " 151  | " Would you like a ride home ? " She hesitates ; gives him a small , grateful smile . " Oh , that 'd be nice . Thanks . " In the car he turns the radio up loud ; it relieves him of the need to talk . Ragged piano blues . They listen intently . She sits , gloved hands in her lap , her books beside her on the seat . " I did n't know you had a car , " she says . " Christmas present . My folks . " Its nice . " Her voice is soft ; he turns the radio down so he can hear her better " I live on Wisconsin , . ' she says . ' ' Yeah , I know . " . She looks over in surprise . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before Christmas . Remember ? " " Oh . " She nods . " Well , it 's that one , there . " She points out a white frame house , with dark green shutters . He pulls to a stop in front , leaving the motor running . Her hand is on the door handle . " Thanks a lot . " " Welcome . " " I 'd ask you to come in , but my mother  --  she 's funny about that . She works ? " She turns suddenly to face him . " There was something I wanted to say to you . That day we  --  I said a stupid thing that day . I did n't know about your brother , then . I 'm sorry . " Stunned , he sits there , not moving . He had almost forgotten the incident . Now it rushes back to him . An embarrassed silence while they sit ; he , staring out at her house , she , at her hands , lying limply in her lap . He gives a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of it , too ? I mean , about me ? " 152  | " Yes . " Should have told her . Should have known someone would tell her . Sometime . Sure . Bring it up over a Coke , " Oh , by the way ? " whip out the newspaper clippings. " ... police chief . . . Lake Forest . . . reasonably certain ... no drugs involved .... " No drugs . Part of the shame . Somehow it is not such a personal failure if you are on something anybody can do something crazy if he is stoned but crazy on your own time is much more serious damning in fact . " There are worse things , " Jeannine says , still looking at her hands . " People do worse things than that . " " Yeah . " He wants to help her through the awkwardness of the moment , but it comes out rudely , as if he is cutting her off . " Well , " she says . Her hand moves quickly downward ; the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would have frozen . " And she is out of the car , safe on the sidewalk , turning away , hurrying up the steps and into the house . He pulls into the driveway to turn around . Nothing to be ashamed of . Maybe not . Nothing anybody particularly wants to be associated with either . The circular drive in front of the house is choked with cars , some of which he recognizes : Truan 's mother 's Mercedes ; the Lazenbys ' white Pontiac ; Mrs. Genthe 's Cadillac . He parks in front and walks up the driveway ; lets himself in through the garage . As he enters the kitchen , the dining-room door swings open . " I thought I heard somebody trying to sneak in ! " Mrs. Lazenby confronts him . I le smiles at her , awkwardly . " Hi , how 're you ? " 153  | " I 'm fine , you dreamer . Thinking you could get away with that ! Up the back stairs without saying hello to anybody , huh ? " He grins . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bring him in here ! " No way out . She takes his hand , leads him into the dining room . He is greeted by his mother 's bridge club ? Mrs. Cahill , Mrs. Genthe , Mrs. Leitch , Mrs. Truan , two other women he has n't met ; he nods , smiling politely during the introductions . His mother sits quietly through his ordeal . " He 's thin , Beth , " Mrs. Truan says . " You should fatten him up . " She smiles . " I low was your exam ? " Not had . " Mrs. Lazenby has cut him a piece of chocolate cake . She hands it to hint , on a napkin . " Aere . For being such a nice boy , humoring the old ladies . Where 've you been , anyway ? We miss you . " " I 've been meaning to stop by , " he lies . " I 've been busy . " " Well , do n't be so busy , " she says sternly . " Come over some night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I will , " he says . He escapes then , to his room , where he sits staring out of the window . The problem of connecting is partly that of fitting mood with opportunity . When he sees Lazenby 's mother , he remembers their house , all warmth and friendliness ; eating toast spread with peanut butter , playing catch in the back yard with Major , the fawn-colored boxer ; he and Lazenby and Buck , each trying to kill the other in a game of Horse under the basketball net . If Lazenby were here . In the room , this minute . But , no . Passing each other each day in the 154  | hall does n't do . The moment is wrong ; the mood is wrong ; too much clanging  --  of lockers , bells , echoes of other conversations . It would n't work anyway . Likewise , Jeannine . But if there were a telephone number here on his desk pad . So that when the feeling hit , he could go directly to the telephone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just dial the number and it would be done . He gets up ; goes to the telephone table in the hall , flipping through the telephone book . D. Pratt on Wisconsin . Carefully he notes it down . On the desk pad in front of him is another number , written months ago . 356-3340 . Under it , in pencil : Karen . He looks at it for a long minute . Then , he gets up and goes again to the telephone . The telephone is answered on the first ring . The voice is suspicious . " You want Karen ? Who is this ? " " It 's  --  I 'm a friend of hers . From Northville . " " Northville . " The voice goes flat . " Well , she is n't home right now . She 's at school . Do n't you go to school ? " Her mother , of course . Nobody else would take the trouble to cross-file hirn , or to be so damn worried . No ma'am no school . No time . Too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do . But we 're off this week . Exams . Would you tell her I called ? My name is Conrad ? " " I 'll give her the message . " The receiver bangs loudly in his ear . " Thanks very much , " he says politely to no one . Replacing the receiver , he goes to his room to fall , face upward on the bed , arms outstretched . Nice . A nice cool zero for the day . Well , she would n't have wanted to talk to him anyway . Why should she ? Why would anybody ? He tries again for the image of the woman 155  | outside the library , but it wo n't come . If she had stared , it was merely out of curiosity . Wondering why one of his eyes was set higher than the other , or if his head was too small for his body . Anyway , a person who performs these joyless and ritualistic sex acts upon himself , this is what he deserves . He rolls onto his stomach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of women escapes the living room , finding its way up the stairs to lie beside him . Fairy . Fag . He rises grimly from the bed . Get it over with . Cross off both numbers in one afternoon why not ? He dials Jeannine 's number . " Hello ? ' ' her soft voice , musical even over the telephone . He clears his throat , nervously . " Hi . This is Conrad , " Ire begins . " Jarrett . " . " Oh , " she says . " Oh , hi . " " Listen , I was wondering . " What Jarrett ? What were you wondering ? " Would you be interested in going out sometime ? " A long pause . " You mean , with you ? Like , on a date ? " Eyes closed , he grinds his forehead , slowly and deliberately against the wall , a bubble of laughter loose in his chest . " Yeah , " he says , " well , it would n't have to be a real date . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of . " She giggles . " Okay , that was dumb , I agree . Just pretend I did n't say that . Start over . " He grins at the receiver ; obligingly he clears his throat . " Hi , " he says . " This is Conrad . Jarrett . " " I 'd love to , " she says . " When ? " 156  | " What we need , " Ray says , " is a secretary . " " I thought we had one . " " No . A legal secretary . A widow , sixty years old , bad legs , good eyes , willing to work nights , willing to knock herself out for this goddamn job ? " " Gee , how come we ca n't find her ? " Cal leans back in his chair . " Sounds like a terrific deal for her . " He stretches , arms over his head , glancing at his wristwatch . Eleven-thirty . " This is ridiculous , " Ray says , rolling down his sleeves . " We are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do we mess with these returns ? Why do n't we tell ' em all , Look , guys , we advise , that 's all , we do not prepare tax returns , we do not do your busy work ' ? What 're you laughing at ? " " I 'm laughing because we have this same conversation every year . Here , give me those files . I 'll take care of them . "  | " Nah , just leave ' em . Sandy 'll do them in the morning . " " Sandy , " Cal says , " is a lousy filer . " Their new secretary . Cherry has gone , but the new one has the same fake smile , the same wide-eyed , overmade-up look and apologetic , fluttering hands . And the file baskets are still overflowing . Business as usual . Ray sighs . " She 's an improvement , though , huh ? Three letters this week , no errors . She does n't crack gum in your face when she talks to you . " Her name is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes to Northwestern . A bad sign , he told Ray said , " Well , that 's what happens when you let your partner do the hiring , buddy ... They lock up ; descend the smooth and silent elevator to the street . A hollow quiet fills the building , even though it is not empty tonight : there are lights behind many doors on their floor . The building glows as they walk away from it . " Want to grab a sandwich ? " " Sure . " They walk the two blocks to the Carriage Grill , a fancy name for a dull spot , with its menu of pale , warmed-over food . A lawyers ' hangout . Down the street , at the Orrington Hotel , are the accountants and data-processing men . Just the same as college , when groups of look-alikes had their own spots : fraternity men , independents , foreign students , med students , art students , the rich , the working ( no poor students just the rich or the working ) . So . Nothing has changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " . . . said I gave her a raw deal , I was the villain because I overexpected , I was a narrow-minded , arrogant chauvinist ? her exact words  --  Christ , I ask you , is it chauvinistic to 158  | expect six hours of work out of somebody , when you 're paying for eight ? " " Cherry ? She told you all that ? " " She wrote it in a letter . Addressed to me . You were innocent , I 'm not sure why . " " I suppose , " Cal says , " because I left it up to you to handle it . I 'm sorry . I know I do that to you . Cop out . I never know how to tell somebody , ' Hey , you 're just not making it . ' I do n't know why . " Ray shakes his head . " No problem , Cal . I do n't mind that . It 's just  --  well , I like to be let in on what 's happening with you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? What d' you mean ? " " You have n't been around the last couple of months , that 's all . " " Around ? What are you talking about ? " " Jesus , Cal , I 've known you for over twenty years , you think I ca n't tell when something 's wrong ? " He looks down into his cup . " You 're not yourself . " " I 'm not myself , " he says . " Okay , I toward , who am I , then ? " But Ray does n't answer . The waiter approaches with their corned-beef sandwiches . He refills their coffee cups . " What do you want me to do ? " Cal says . " Stop by your office , hum a few bars from The Sound of Music every day ? Everything 's fine , Ray . Nothing to worry about . " " Why are you worrying , then ? " He laughs . " I 'm not . In fact , I 've been thinking about taking a couple of days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Dallas . " " Well , great . Why do n't you do it ? " " The middle of the month  --  I 'd be leaving you with all this crap ? " " Do n't be dumb , I 'd do it to you in a minute . " He 159  | takes a bite of his sandwich . " Beth going with you ? " " Probably , yeah . We 'll stay with her brother and his wife . They have a place in Richardson . " " I think that 's good , " Ray says . " I think it 'd do you both good to get away for a few days . That 's the answer . " The answer to what ? Life , reduced to the simplest of terms . Formulas . Get away for a while . Everything works out for the best . " Look , I 'm sorry , " Ray says . " It 's none of my business . ! Out , you worry too much . You 've been on the rack about him long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to let go sometime , buddy . " .. " Ray , I 'm not on the rack about him . " " Thing is " Hay says , in another year he 'll be gone . Off to Michigan or Harvard or wherever the hell he gets it iu his head he wants to go . Maybe he 'll decide to take a tour of Europe for a year , not even go to school , who knows ? " " How come all of a sudden you know so much about him ? " " I do n't . Look , I 'm giving you the benefit of my experience . " Thanks , " he says drily . " I mean , with Valerie , it 's more than her living away from home . She 's gone , Cal . She 's got her own life , her own friends , she breezes in for a few days of vacation ? maybe girls are different , I do n't know . Or maybe she was too aware of the stuff that happened  --  I mean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And all that worrying does n't amount to a hill of crap . Just wasted energy . " " I 'm not worried about Con , " he says . " Who , then ? Is it Beth ? Is something wrong between Beth and you ? " 160  | " No ! " " You sure ? " " Yeah , I 'm sure ! " He turns . Ray is wearing an uncomfortable look . " Well , you gave me some advice a long time ago , on that business with Nancy , and you know what that lets you in for , do n't you ? Getting it all hack someday , whether you want it or not . So , how do you want it ? " He gives a snort of laughter . " I do n't want it . " No mistaking the look of discomfort , now . Ray has something on his mind . " Listen , Cal , Nance and Beth had lunch together , last week ? " He breaks off , staring down into his coffee cup . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more directness . Make an appointment . What are you supposed to tell me ? " " I 'm not supposed to tell you anything , " Ray says unhappily . " I 'm just telling you . They had lunch together . Beth is pretty upset . She thinks you 're out of focus . She says you 're obsessed with Con 's problems . You ca n't think about anything else ? " " That 's ridiculous , " he snaps . " She ca n't think about them at all . Now what does that say to you ? " " It says nobody 's normal , " Ray says . " Nobody 's got it together , not anybody in this frigging world . Look , I 'm sure as hell not setting myself up as some example , Cal , I 'm just  --  I just did n't know if you knew how she felt . " " I know . " He feels sorry for Ray . This is not a pleasant role . Counselor . He remembers that from seven years ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , How are things with you and Nancy now ? How would you describe your marriage , in terms of knowing each other ? In terms of being friends ? Of understanding that hopelessly intricate network of clash and resolution that has been woven over the last twenty years ? Two separate , 161
