txt With the speed of a sprinter and the stamina of a long-distance runner , the new UN Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim is proving himself a tireless globe-trotter . Eight breathless months after promising activist diplomacy , Mr. Waldheim is about to visit his 22nd country . This time it is China which he is scheduled to visit Aug. 11 to 15 , followed by a vacation , and then a visit Aug. 31 to Yugoslavia . When that mission is accomplished , the , Secretary-General will have chalked up meetings on their home grounds with the governments of all the five big powers ? the United States , the Soviet Union , China , Britain , and France ? who are permanent UN Security Council members . So far each has greeted him as though he were an important head of state . The China visit is regarded as particularly significant for it demonstrates China 's close interest in the United Nations . // *Globe-trotting Waldheim off for China talks // Further confirmation of this comes in the announcement that Peking is to establish a permanent mission to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ China has expanded its press corps here making it the largest single news organization at UN headquarters , and causing several correspondents to shift rooms to accommodate them . Mr. Waldheim 's trip to China is projected guardedly here as a " tour d'horizon of international events " which would 1nclude discussion of the next- General Assembly session which begins Sept. 19 . Asked privately if disarmament , Vietnam , and the Korean question would be among the issues raised since they reflect areas in the past of UN-China disagreement , a UN official replied : " It is not what he will bring up . It 4s what they ( the Chinese ) bring up . The host country decides the agenda . " Mr. Waldheim tends to distinguish between official invitations such as these and those which take him to international confelrences . Among such events he has attended during this past year are : the first Security Council meeting in Africa ( in Addis Ababa , Ethopia ) ; the United Nations trade and development conference in Santiago , Chile ; the Stockholm human environment conference ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as the South Africa-SouthWest Africa trip ? so arranged because the Security Counicl resolution required the Secretary-General to establish these contacts . Matter of principle Besides invitation such as these and those from other official heads of state , Mr. Waldheim also has made it a matter of principle to visit personally the big power leadership for an exchange of views on problems confronting the UN . The Secretary-General has traveled so extensively that there has not been a single month since taking office when a trip abroad has not been scheduled . June provided a dramatic example of jet-age diplomacy with Mr. Waldheim opening the Stockholm environment conference on June 5 , flying to Cyprus on June 6 , to Turkey on June 8 , Athens June 9 , Geneva also June 9 , Rabat for the OAU meeting June 11 and returning to New York June 14. - With all this visible activity , contrasts are quickly drawn with the low profile of his predecessor , U Thant , U Thant 's admirers believe the less visible approach which only surfaced when real results were achieved does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office . Criticism shrugged off A sharper judgment is that Mr. Waldheim should not mistake mere physical motion for diplomatic movement . Mr. Waldheim is aware of some criticism of being too mobile , but he shrugs it off . Personally he would sooner spend a restful weekend in a summer home in Greenwich , Conn. , but his sense of responsibility to the world community makes him feel that world travel is part of the business of being Secretary-General . The tall , elegant diplomat also believes that his travels have borne some fruit ? such as the quest to resolve the South-West Africa problem and his journey to Cyprus where political talks were resumed during his visit . His outlook moreover is tinged with realism . He sums it up : " In seven or eight months you ca n't solve the many problems that have been on the UN agenda for 15 , 20 , or 27 years . It takes a certain time . But , all in all , I think it has shown me clearly that traveling is worthwhile . Nor only does it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better personal contact . "
