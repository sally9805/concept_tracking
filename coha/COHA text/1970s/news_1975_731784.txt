txt Nearly 110 years ago the little Maryland city of Frederick saved Union supplies by meeting a Confederate demand for $200,000 ransom . And Frederick still is trying to get its money back from Uncle Sam . Congress receives a number of such requests from time to time , some for even older debts . During the Revolutionary War , Robert Morris financed much of the colonial effort . But after the war the fledgling nation did not repay him ; its economy was severely crimped by the twin ravages of serious inflation and high unemployment . ( Sound familiar ? Periodically Morris descendants petition Congress to repay the outstanding Morris loans . They have n't succeeded , either . On another level are the generations-old Indian protests against hundreds of broken treaties with the white man 's government in Washington . Despite some recent successes , most Indian efforts have failed to get Uncle Sam to live up to his promises . Concern for precedent All of this helps explain why the current effort is unlikely to regain Frederick its money : It would set a precedent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time when the U.S. is looking for ways to trim expenditures . The events behind the Frederick request began July 9 , 1864 , when Gen. Jubal A. Early , commander of 20,000 Confederate troops , rode into defenseless Frederick ? some 45 miles northwest of Washington ? and demanded $200,000 . Otherwise , it was implied , important federal military and hospitals supplies worth between $1 million and $1.5 million would he confiscated . After negotiations , Union-supporter Frederick met the demand , and the supplies went untouched . The drawn-out talks served another purpose : They delayed by a day a Confederate effort to capture Washington by advancing from the north , enabling President Lincoln to reinforce defenses along his northern perimeter . Sen. Charles Mc . Mathias , a Frederick resident and expert on local history , thinks " the time has c , pme fur the federal government to reimburse Frederick . The federal government should pay Frederick value for the value It received as a result of the patriotic acts of this city . " // * Focus : town 's ransom // Senator Mathias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a city with 8,000 people during the Civil War now grown to 21,000 . It 's not a new proposal : The Senator has introduced it in every new Congress since he became a member of the House of Representatives in 1961 . Outside Maryland , most Americans who know anything about Frederick 's Civil War connections probably think of an entirely different episode : the " Barbara Frietchie " incident . That occurred two years earlier , when a Confederate invading force commanded by General " Stonewall " Jackson marched into town . What actually happened then is clouded by time and the poetic license of oft-sentimental poet , John Greenleaf Whittier , whose " Barbara Frietchie " has been memorized by generations of Amerieb.n schoolchildren . According to legend , Jackson found one Union flag still flying in Frederick , in front of the home of 96-year-old Barbara Frietchie . He ordered his men to shoot it down . Did it happen ? But the heroine waved it defiantly , insists Whittier , and shouted : " ' Shoot , if you must , this old gray head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Impressed by her spunk General Jackson gave in , the poet tells us : " ' Who touches a hair on yon gray head Dies like a dog ! March on ! ' he said . " Historians are not at all sure she ever waved that flag , or that she said what Whittier " heard . " Nevertheless , that 's what many Americans think of as Frederick 's Civil War incident . Senator Mathias 's proposal for reimbursement will never capture the public imagination as poet Whittler 's version of the Frietchie defiance . But in terms of cold , hard cash , it has its important side , too .
