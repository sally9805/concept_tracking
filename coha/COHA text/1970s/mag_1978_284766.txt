TV viewing is off for the first time <P> All fall , broadcast and ad executives nervously peeked at the figures on their desks , then shut their eyes and turned the tallies face down , as if they hoped the whole thing would go away . Like scientists who had discovered that rain also falls up , they could not believe what they were seeing . Last week , however , the two rating services , Nielsen and Arbitron , confirmed their fears : in 1977 , for the first time in history , television viewing declined . <P> For daytime audiences , the numbers were startling . From November 1976 to November 1977 , Nielsen put the dropoff at 6.4%-roughly equivalent to the combined populations of Detroit and San Francisco . The Arbitron figures were even more dramatic . From 9 a.m. to noon , they said , viewing was down 11%-or goodbye Chicago . The arithmetic for the prime-time evening hours was less dramatic , but significant nonetheless . Nielsen said the nighttime decline was 3.1% ; Arbitron said it was 5% . <P> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimated $7.65 billion of their clients ' money on TV this year , the news was dismaying . " Nobody ever assumed that viewership would go down , " observes Bill Tenebruso of Wells , Rich , Greene . " I think it 's a little premature to start saying that something devastating happened to TV in 1977 , " says Walter Reichel of the Ted Bates agency . " But something is going on . " <P> For daytime the something was fairly obvious . Families are smaller , one breadwinner 's salary does not go as far as it used to , the status and expectations of women are altering ; thus many onetime housewives who used to cry with the soaps are now working outside the home . <P> The nighttime decline is harder to explain , but there are probably several reasons . This year 's emphasis on specials and miniseries- " stunting , " as it is known on Network Row-has confused many viewers , leaving them uncertain when their favorite series will be on . " The old habit of most people was to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for Mary Tyler Moore , ' " says Tenebruso . " You ca n't assume anything any more . Shows are shuffled around like peas in a shell game . " If a viewer misses the first episode of a miniseries , he may skip the other episodes as well . <P> Many people , mostly outside the industry , believe that audiences are nibbling less because they like the menu less . " The networks have always arrogantly said , ' There 's nobody here but us capons , and we give the public what it wants , ' " says Martin Mayer , author of About Television . " The decline in viewing may prove that the networks are not giving the public what it wants after all . This year the new shows have really not been very successful . They have been overcalculated in terms of audience and reaction . The networks are increasingly concerned with what the research department says people want . "
