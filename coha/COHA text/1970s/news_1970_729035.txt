txt City officials seekingto avert a threatened taxi driver strike were reported ready yesterday to recommend a $50-million a year fare increase that would include raising the present $1.35 average ride to $1.90 on the meter . Also in the package would be an extra charge of 25 cents for every passenger in addition to the person who engaged the cab . The rise in the cost of the average ride would be accomplished through new rates of 50 cents for the first fifth of a mile ; 10 cents for each additional fifth , and 10 cents for each one and a half minutes of waiting time . These rates are now charged in Boston , Cleveland , Detroit and Philadelphia . Present New York taxi rates are 45 cents for the first sixth of a mile ; 10 cents for each additional third of a mile , and 10 cents for each two minutes of waiting time . The average ride is 2.4 miles . Last Increase in 1968 A City Hall source said that Mayor Lindsay would present these suggestions to the City Council , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A fare increase was enacted by the Council in 1968 after it had been proposed by the Mayor . There were indications that any plan to tax additional passengers might run into trouble in the Council . A source close to the Council leadership said last night , " Some Council members would be likely to oppose the 25 cent head tax as inequitable . " He explained that a businessman using a taxi paid for on his company 's expense account would probably not complain about an increase in the meter l rate , but that a family of four would suffer a hardship because of having to pay for the extra passengers . The plan envisages the drivers ' keeping the extra revenue from additional passengers . Mr. Lindsay , who returned last night from a vacation in Majorca , off the coast of Spain . has scheduled a meeting on the taxi situation for 11 A.M. today at Gracie Mansion with Vincent D. , chairman of the State Mediation Board ; Deputy Mayor Richard R. Aurelio , and John G. de Roos , Deputy Transportation Administrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garages and their 36,000 drivers and inside employes expires at midnight tomorrow night . Local 3036 of the Taxi Drivers Union has threatened to strike if it does not have a satisfactory new contract by then . The fleet taxicab owners have estimated that the union demands for improvements in wages and fringe benefits would cost $64-million . A financial survey made public by their accountants nas contended that the industry as a whole is losing about $7-million a year . City Hall has confirmed this analysis . The increase on the metered rates would average 40 per cent , while the total cost increase would be more than that because of the extra passenger surcharge . However , industry revenues , now estimated at $250-million a year , would increase only 20 per cent , because the number of passengers is expected to decline as rates rise . To Equal Transit Workers In their negotiations , the cabbies have insisted that they wanted pay , pensions and , ther benefits that would evial ' those of the city 's transit woritacs . Including tips , the average taxi driver earns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage of $174 a week , but with overtime they earn close to $200 a week . Deputy Mayor Aurelio was busy yesterday at City Hall working on a report on the taxi negotiations to be submitted today to the Mayor . He came into the press room , in his shirt sleeves , to give newsmen a briefing on the situation . " The administration 's position is that any rate increase the City Council gives should be accompanied by establishment of a taxi commission which would assume regulation and rate making in the future , " he said . " The Council has not acted , but our talks with the leadership indicate they have n't closed the door . " Mayor Submitted Bill Mr. Aurelio said that a bill to establish such a commission had been submitted to the Council by the Mayor about six weeks ago . In addition to taking away rate making from the Council , the commission would regulate gypsy cabs , which do not have police department taxi shields and are forbidden to cruise in search of passengers . Commenting on Mr. Aurelio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Council , said : " The pros and cons of the taxi commission were advanced in testimony on various bills in the last session of the Council , but failed to spur any real interest in its establishment . The Mayor 's new commission proposal reached us just two weeks ago . It is being studied . However , I would assume that in a discussion of any Lindsay proposal for a taxi fare hike , the commission proposal is bound to arise . " In connection with the proposed $50-million fare increase , city officials have estimated that about $30-million would go to the employes and the rest to fleet owners . Negotiations between the owners and the union adjourned yesterday at 3:30 A.M. and then resumed at 5 P.M. at the Commodore Hotel . The talks recessed at 1 A. M. today and , will resume later in the day . In analyzing the dispute , Mr. said , " This is an almost impossible situation to resolve . " He said the needs of the workers , the financial plight of the owners and the possibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much contributed to the complexity of the problem .
