By rights Offenbach 's opera Tales of Hoffmann should belong to the tenor in the title role . It is he , after all , who goes awooing , however unsuccessfully , after Stella the actress , Olympia the windup doll , Giulietta the courtesan and Antonia the consumptive soprano . If he is not careful , though , the tenor can be easily upstaged by the soprano who normally portrays all four heroines . Her music is uniformly exquisite , and on top of that she gets to show her legs in the gondola scene . <P> In the shimmering new Hoffmann that Director Tito Capobianco has conceived and staged for the New York City Opera , it is neither the tenor nor the soprano who steals the show . Instead it is the bass , who plays the four incarnations of the devil . No surprise , since the roles are sung by that master of operatic guises and disguises Norman Treigle . By design , and also by the sheer magic of Treigle 's acting , this Hoffmann is a black comedy that belongs-curly locks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished this first of all with some visual ( but never spoken ) additions to the plot that enable not just Lindorf but Coppelius , Dappertutto and Dr. Miracle as well - all played by Treigle-to win the girls that Hoffmann loses . The first act , for example , usually ends with Coppelius seeming to dismantle the doll Olympia before Hoffmann 's horrified eyes . He does so in the new production , but then Coppelius and a happy flesh-and-blood Olympia ( Soprano Beverly Sills ) are seen embracing behind a curtain . Obviously the girl is part poltergeist , too , and in league with Lucifer . <P> The most obvious alteration in Capobianco 's new production is the elimination of the brief epilogue in which Hoffmann is found in a drunken stupor , overwhelmed by his failures . Instead , the final curtain goes to the triumphant Dr. Miracle , who has just caused the poor Antonia to sing herself to death . In one of the chanciest bits of operatic stagecraft seen in New York in years , Dr. Miracle miraculously pops up on the outer rail of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and laughs his final laugh of evil victory . <P> Director Capobianco 's inventions are infinitely more than acceptable for the oldest reason known to show business : they work . Given the incomparable team of Treigle and Sills , he has the added advantage of dealing from strength . Sills is in superb voice and thespian mien , as usual . She somehow manages , for instance , to make the viewer simultaneously amused by and sorry for the doll Olympia . Wind her up , and oh , how she warbles-even standing on one foot . Take her hand too passionately , and oh , how she runs away .
