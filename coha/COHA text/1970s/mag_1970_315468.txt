" Our great leader , Chairman Mao , has stated , ' We too should produce man-made satellites . ' We are happy to announce that this great call by Chairman Mao has come true . " With that characteristic bombast , the New China News Agency last week announced an important technological achievement : the successful lofting of a 381-lb. satellite into earth orbit . <P> Besides broadcasting the Maoist unofficial anthem ( " The East is Red , the sun rises , Mao Tse-tung comes out in the East . . . " ) , the latest satellite was roughly twice the size of the earliest 1957-vintage Russian Sputnik 1 . Its launching demonstrated that China has joined the ranks of the U.S. , the Soviet Union , France and Japan in developing both rocketry and electronic gear capable of such a feat . <P> The announcement caused little surprise in the West . U.S. Defense Secretary Melvin Laird told Congress in February that the Chinese would " attempt to test-launch their first ICBM or space booster in the near future . " The Pentagon added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technological progress which is being made in that country . " More precisely , it appeared to demonstrate that the Chinese were advancing toward an important goal : the building of missiles capable of delivering nuclear warheads to U.S. and European targets as early as 1973 . The news might well affect U.S. Congressional action on a proposed expansion of the Safeguard anti-ballistic missile system .
