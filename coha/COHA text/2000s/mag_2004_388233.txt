Will the practice survive ? <p> Charles Dickens was not thinking about payday lenders when he wrote about " the best of times " and " the worst of times , " but had he been doing so , this particular turn of phrase would have accurately described the state of the payday lending industry today . From its relatively modest big-city neighborhood origins to its current national profile and reach , including a number of nationwide financial firms engaged exclusively or predominantly in payday lending , the industry has benefited from rapid growth and an embedded high-profit business model in becoming a $40 billion per year industry  --  good times , indeed . On the other side of the ledger , however , the payday lending industry has been the subject of what can only be described as a regulatory gang-tackling at the federal level , an increased incidence of tough state payday loan laws , and a continuing hostile public relations offensive by leading consumer groups  --  certainly some bad times . And , behind the debate over payday lending there are some entrenched regulatory and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the public discussion and throw a shadow over the continued expansion of this industry , which is a promise of interesting times for the foreseeable future . What is Payday Lending ? <p> Payday lending , also known as payday advance , is the popular name for what is more formally referred to as " deferred check presentment lending . " In its basic  --  and predominant  --  form , a pay-day loan is a short-term , unsecured loan in a relatively small amount ( generally under $500 ) that is made on the strength of a borrower 's postdated check and a regular job . For the use of this money for a short time period , the borrower will pay the payday lender a fee ( frequently in the range of $15 per $100 borrowed ) . A payday loan usually is made for no more than two or three weeks , and is supposed to enable customers to meet short-term cash-flow demands until their next cash infusion-usually their next payday ( hence the name ) . If the customer can not repay the loan when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check or renew ( or " roll over " ) the loan for another term . <p> Payday loans offer the appeal to consumers of being fast , not paper-intensive ( often , not much more than a current bank statement , pay stub and proof of residence/Social Security number will suffice ) and convenient . They also are a source of credit  --  and cash  --  for consumers who have no or limited access to credit in the mainstream banking system because of their socioeconomic status or poor credit history . For this reason , payday lending is considered a form of " subprime " lending . <p> And , there lies the rub : Consumer groups charge that payday lending is an inherently predatory activity that targets poor and blue-collar consumers who are coaxed into abusive lending relationships characterized by poorly disclosed and exorbitant loan fees , oppressive collection practices , and a vicious circle of loan rollovers ( each time with new fees ) from which they can not emerge . Payday lenders reply that their services benefit consumers by making credit available to segments of the population @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks loans and other more traditional financing alternatives ; that their fees in many cases are lower than the bounced-check and other bank fees assessed on consumers with cash flow problems ; and that the abusive practices in question are not used by responsible lenders . They also point to the fact that payday lending is becoming increasingly regulated at the state level and is subject to a full panoply of federal consumer protection laws . In addition , payday lenders have their political defenders , in that a number of members of Congress have encouraged the federal financial regulatory agencies not to regulate the payday lending industry out of existence . The Regulatory Landscape <p> Payday lenders are regulated primarily at the state level , under state laws governing consumer finance activities in general , or , in approximately 30 states , laws specifically governing payday lending activities . These various laws impose licensing , financial responsibility and various consumer protection requirements on payday lenders , including disclosures of payday lending fees as an annual percentage rate , and in many cases impose relatively strict interest rate ( usury ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically restrict or prohibit various types of practices that have been identified as " predatory , " including the number and mechanics of payday loan rollovers , abusive collection practices and the like . <p> At the federal level , payday lenders are not subject to any specific body of financial regulation . Because they are non-bank lending organizations , they are not directly subject to federal banking laws , or the direct oversight of the various federal banking agencies . As consumer lenders , however , they are subject to a variety of consumer protection laws primarily administered by the Federal Trade Commission , including the Truth In Lending Act , the Fair Credit Reporting Act , the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act , and the consumer protection provisions of the FTC Act . In addition , payday lending organizations are regulated as " financial institutions " by the FTC under the 1999 GrammLeach-Bliley Act 's financial privacy requirements ( Title V ) . Living in the Regulatory Environment <p> The predominance of state regulation in the area of payday lending has discrete consequences for the way many payday lenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of multiple  --  and occasionally inconsistent  --  state regulatory requirements , and benefit from the more liberal usury limitations found in some states ( and " export " those interest rates to other states ) , payday lenders have actively sought out formal business referral/marketing relationships with commercial banks and savings banks . These relationships have been structured for the most part as relationships whereby a bank agrees to fund and carry payday loans , and the payday lender agrees to market and service those loans . In this fashion , payday lenders can avoid inconsistent state usury and other consumer protection limitations . In addition , these alliances relieve payday lenders of the financial obligation to fund the loans made through these arrangements ; in this manner , the payday lender can reduce its funding demands and costs , and the payday lenders and their partner banks benefit from the generally lower funding cost that banks enjoy from federal deposit insurance and the federal safety net . The Regulatory Response <p> The reactions of the federal banking regulators to the payday lending activities of their regulated banks , in particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Office of the Controller of the Currency ( OCC ) has been particularly hostile to efforts by payday lenders to " partner " with national banks . The OCC has taken several enforcement actions against national banks that have entered into marketing partnerships with payday lenders , and also has taken administrative action against at least two payday lenders , for alleged violations of law and unsafe and unsound banking practices . These problems , according to the OCC , arise from structural weaknesses in the relationships between national banks and payday lenders , in that the banks have been charged with significant lapses in their policies and procedures and risk-management system in extending payday loans and managing the lending product . By effectively ceding responsibility for the actual payday lending activities to the payday lenders , according to the OCC , the national bank has effectively " rented its charter " to the payday lender . Comptroller of the Currency John T. Hawke has been unusually blunt in saying that he wants payday lenders to " stay the hell away " from national banks and the national banking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and national banks have complied or are in the process of complying with this pointed request . <p> The other federal banking agencies have not been much kinder to payday lending organizations . The Office of Thrift Supervision issued guidance in late 2000 concerning savings institutions ' relationships with payday lenders , and more recently has discouraged its constituent savings institutions from partnering with payday lenders . The Federal Reserve Board amended its Truth in Lending Act commentary in 2000 specifically to cover payday lending activities , and senior Federal Reserve Board officials recently have informally acknowledged the risks associated with payday lending activities , but the Federal Reserve Board has not made any formal statements about payday lending . At the same time , the fact that there appears at present to be only one Federal Reserve Board-regulated bank in the payday lending business might suggest that FRB 's regulatory attitude has not been hospitable . <p> At this time , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) may be the only federal banking agency that is institutionally prepared to tolerate marketing alliances between payday lenders and their regulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks ) . The FDIC this past summer published supervisory guidelines for payday lending activities which , in the main , make it difficult but not impossible for FDIC-regulated banks to establish marketing relationships with payday lending organizations . ( See , FDIC , " Guidelines for Payday Lending , " **49;1938;TOOLONG . ) Among other things , the FDIC guidelines impose significant additional regulatory capital requirements on FDIC-regulated banks engaged in payday lending activities , and in effect require those organizations to treat all payday loans as classified assets ( substandard ) for regulatory reporting , risk management and loan loss reserving purposes . While the effect of the FDIC guidelines has not been , to date , to drive all FDIC-regulated banks out of the payday lending business , it nonetheless has significantly raised the bar on FDIC-regulated banks that want to engage , or continue to engage in , payday lending activities , whether on their own initiative or in partnership with a payday lending firm . Even this regulatory effort , however , has been criticized as inadequate by consumer lending groups . <p> At the state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been stringent . Payday lenders and their bank partners have found themselves subject to various lawsuits by state regulators , municipalities and consumer groups alleging violations of state consumer protection and usury limitations in connection with payday lending activities conducted within those states . Other state regulatory authorities have indicated their interest in investigating payday lending activities , and at this date several of those investigations are ongoing . The Payday Lending Conundrum <p> The intensity of the federal and state regulatory interest in payday lending is , in one respect , not altogether surprising , in that payday lending is , almost by definition , " subprime " lending . At the same time , payday lending nonetheless is a line of business that is subject to relatively substantial state and federal regulation , including the various consumer protection laws administered by the FTC . In addition , the simple growth of the payday lending industry demonstrates an obvious fact : There is a strong consumer demand for this product . While the principal customer base of the payday lending industry is lower-income and lower-middle-income consumers , as a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a bank account and a Social Security number in order to qualify for a payday loan . And , while there certainly are predatory practices that can be associated with payday lending , including uncontrolled payday loan rollovers ( with additional fees ) and abusive collection practices , it would be an overstatement to say that these practices characterize the entire payday lending industry . There is also the fact that consumers who use the services of payday lenders often have limited , if any , access to mainstream financial services , and hence it is more than passing naive for consumer organizations to suggest that these consumers ought to look to credit cards and other traditional bank products ( which , if they are available at all , may end up being more costly than the payday lending alternative ) . <p> That being said , consumers who do not have ready access to mainstream financial services are in a relatively vulnerable posture vis -- vis payday and other subprime lenders . Hence , there needs to be a recognition among payday lenders in general and their defenders that these lenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatively unfriendly  --  federal and state regulatory scrutiny . For those responsible players in the industry , the best course of action therefore lies in assuring that their payday lending operations are conducted in a transparent and straightforward manner with consumers , and in compliance with applicable laws and regulations . In turn , this would mean that payday lenders should accept an enhanced obligation to assure that their compliance policies and procedures , both in their creation and in their implementation , are robust , and that the payday lending organizations place regulatory compliance and fair treatment of consumers at the top of their priority lists . ( Consumer groups , predictably , have scoffed at the self-reforming efforts of the payday lending industry , given their apparent desire that the industry not exist at all . ) Conclusion <p> In summary , the payday lending industry has to police itself ; to do so , the industry has to assure , individually and collectively , that its members comply with applicable laws and regulations , and deal fairly and openly with their potential borrowers . On the issue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more difficult for payday lenders , inasmuch as there appears to be a distinct trend to limit the lending fees that payday lenders can charge in individual states ; if that trend continues , of course , payday lenders will have to consider for themselves the continued economic viability of the payday lending business model . But , for the time being , the principal challenge facing payday lenders , as they attempt to emerge from the regulatory vortex in which they now find themselves , is to abide by simple good practices and good behavior . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Charles M.
