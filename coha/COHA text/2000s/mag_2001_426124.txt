/Jan 2002 Widney Moore Gallery . Portland , Oregon May 15-July-15 , 2001 For the past 20 years , the Korean artist Chunghie Lee has investigated an array of media , from intimate handmade paper collage to the broad gestures of costuming dance performances . But underlying this range have been two core concerns- exploring the cultural metaphors within the traditional use of fabric by Korean women and probing the more abstract realms of structure and image with a freedom best described as Rauschenbergian . As this exhibit attested , the restless Lee continues to explore , now drawn by the possibilities of the total environment . In Lee 's hands the Widney Moore Gallery became a theatrical set . A 20-foot-square expanse of hemp was unfurled across the floor-to-ceiling front window like a giant Tibetan prayer cloth . In the vestibule hung a pair of long , wispy silk banners , * each layered in vibrant green beneath crimson and dotted with photographs of what she describes as the " no-name women " - her ancestors , who were regarded within Korea 's highly patriarchal culture as nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art boutique space was turned into a participatory exhibit , with Lee 's costumes draping a group of mannequins or hanging in the racks ready to be donned as part of an ethereal world . At the root of much of Lee 's work with fabric is the Korean pojagi , a cloth traditionally used by women to carry things and to wrap precious belongings . Lee has focused on the chogakpo variation , typically sewn from scraps of ramie , hemp and silk , pieces left from making new apparel or salvaged from old . Tailored together with a technique known as kekki , in which the pieces are stitched , folded , stitched , folded and stitched again , pojagi is as much about joints as about expanses . The result is a cubist space that with the translucent silk and hemp has an effect suggestive of stained glass . First made in peasant homes , pojagi ultimately took on larger cultural meaning , not unlike American patchwork quilt making , as old fabric was given new life and used to wrap a woman 's most precious gifts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the cloth has also become a metaphor for a woman 's place in Korean culture . Like traditional dress , the fabric tantalizes and hides , white the seams protect and restrain . Lee 's exhibit was an encyclopedia of pojagi techniques , traditional and invented , from bat-patterned knots at the patchwork corners ( symbolizing fortune ) to radiating cintamani patterns ( to prevent wrinkles in the fabric ) . In addition , she has invented sewn-paper versions of pojagi , stained with hand-ground India ink to look like wrinkled metal . In general , Lee 's colors build on the traditional use of vibrant pastels , but she often increases the chromatic intensity in away that sneaks up on you , like the brightness of snow on an overcast day . One mannequin , for instance , was veiled in layers of warm and cool pastels , a flaming pink and electric green seemingly melting through chilly gray  --  blue. * Except for her opaque winter cloaks , Lee 's apparel tends to be sheer and semi-sheer , but the intense colors illuminate the body as it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the antecedents of these clothes were usually worn for the eyes of men , the effect is spiritual rather than erotic . Lee earned her B.F.A . from Seoul 's Hong-lk University , but then raised a family before returning for her M.F.A. at what in Korea was the unheard of age of 37 . In 1994 , she was a Fulbright exchange scholar at the Rhode Island School of Design . As she has deepened her exploration of Korean fabric traditions , she has widened her vision to encompass Western mixed-media techniques and modes of presentation . Her stated ambition for the Moore show was to work with " the concept of harmony in architectural space " by making site-specific wall fabrics and sculptures along with clothes and accessories for a total environment . The need of the gallery to display work by other artists may have complicated that goal , but Lee left little doubt of her understanding of architecture . There 's a sense of discovery when you examine Lee 's work up close . The kekki seams become a tensile structure held aloft by the structure of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's surface and through its layers of color , stitching , photos and the occasional patch of embroidery , there 's a procession through time and space not unlike moving through rooms and passing by objects . The environmental elements in this show- principally , the hemp banner and a pair of photo-screened silk hangings-provide a fitting atmosphere . Sheer silk when layered creates kinetic moire patterns and , when taken to architectural scale , has the effect of sun breaking through fog . The cubist space shaped by the stitching and the chromatic intensity of Lee 's chosen silks and the haunting historical photographs of women floating in the layers create a hallucinatory sense of memory . Though the constituent elements may be drawn from some distant , repressed history ( or history of repression ) , the totality of Chunghie Lee 's work exudes the spiritualvelocity of an artistically unbridled future . - RANDY GRACE * These works and a costume by Chunghie Lee were purchased and donated by Dorothy Lemelson to the Portland Art Museum Asian Art Collection .
