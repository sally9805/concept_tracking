We 're loud , proud and 37 million strong // Such a critical mass of older women with a tradition of rebellion and independence and a way of making a living has not occurred before in history . - Gerda Lerner , historian JYOTI , A JUNGIAN THERAPIST WHO HAS STUDIED native cultures around the world , had a dream about our generation . In it , she said , " We were donkeys and ponies , and we were a big dust storm going over the desert . Then , the dust settled and there was something new growing . That was what the wave of us had come to do . Until now , when we 've gotten to a new stage , we 've looked around and said , ' We do n't like this ; this is just crazy ... ' and we 've changed it . Why should we use our elder years-our wise years-any differently ? " Saving the world may not be what most of us have in mind for the next chapter in our lives , yet the journey we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry outward to the way we express ourselves in the world , the way we connect with other individuals and generations , and ultimately to the impact we can have on society . We 37 million women in our late 40s , 50s and 60s are part of a sea of change that can lift a fleet of boats , not just our own . But we are only just beginning to become aware of the tidal wave we represent . Not only are we gaining strength both as individuals and as a group , but our influence is compounded by our attitude . " Women get more radical with age , " Gloria Steinern frequently points out , because for one thing , we have had more years of experience coming up against false assumptions about what we are capable of , and for another , we have the daring that comes with what I call " the fuck-you 50s " to defy those barriers . Economists , politicians , corporate executives , sociologists and medical researchers are waking up to the thundering herd of " ponies and donkeys " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Throughout our First Adulthood we experienced the validity of the phrase " the personal is political " ; that what made one woman feel stifled , oppressed or just uncomfortable , often to her own shame , would turn out to be part of a larger pattern that needed to be changed . And then , no longer isolated and guilt-ridden individuals , but an activist lobby of dissatisfied citizens , we set about to change it . Just remember how the inability of thousands of young athletes to get themselves taken seriously created the groundswell that opened up Little League competition to girls and produced the Title IX legislation . The potential for that kind of cultural shift exists today . Thirty-seven million doses of what Margaret Mead named " postmenopausal zest " make quite a potent brew . We have the voting power , economic clout , the leadership skills and the organizing experience to reshuffle the priorities of our society-and not just for ourselves . VOTING POWER Every politician has an eye on us . The gender gap-the divergence of women 's votes from men's-was first observed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Virginia Slims cigarettes to confirm its " You 've come a long way , baby " slogan-showed a growing unrest and assertiveness among women voters . Harris found that " there are signs that women are now playing for keeps in politics , more than any time in the past , and that this activism will accelerate . " Over the next 30 years-our First Adulthood-the trend has solidified , and the gap has been shown to increase with age . Photograph Suzanne Braun Levine , New York City , October 27 , 2004 . Photographed by Heather Weston // That was n't all Harris observed . Women are " more inclined ... to vote and to become active not only for their self-interest , but for the interest of society , the world , and most of all , out of compassion for humanity , " he reported . Since then , the pattern has been documented over and over again . Polls show that the issues women consider priorities-abortion , the environment , gun control , social programs-are lesser concerns for men . In general , we envision @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the community . As women become an increasing majority of voters , and second Adulthood women become an increasing proportion ofthat group , the political process will begin to reflect the potential for change we represent . ECONOMIC CLOUT We are now in the unprecedented position of being able to put some money where our bigmouthed opinions are . The more equitable our earning power becomes and the more knowledgeable we become about financial management , the more money we have to spend and invest . We are becoming a source of capital and enterprise ( the majority of small business start-tips are by women ) , and we are becoming a major consumer bloc , too . We can make a big difference by simply putting our dollars behind causes or people that seem to have the right idea , or we can make investments and purchases with those concerns in mind . Our buying power is particularly potent . You would n't know it to look at the ads , in which we are invisible , but we spend one-third more on toiletries ( $8 billion ) than women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daily , the apparel industry bible , " industry representatives confirmed that despite being ignored by many marketers , graying boomers are the most powerful force in the apparel industry . " Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff , who runs a program called Odyssey : School for the second Half of Life , has come to the conclusion in her book written with James Maxmin , The Support Economy , that the challenges of our tumultuous lives so far puts us " in the vanguard of the new society of individuals , even as it amplified our role in consumption . " That suggests , she goes on , " that the commercialization of women 's dreams will be an important factor in the next economic revolution . " What those dreams are and how they are commercialized are questions we need to answer before economic forces do it for us . We have yet to harness the consumer power of our Second Adulthood , but it offers a wide range of opportunities for activism-the very successful first consumer boycott was organized in 1973 by housewives over meat prices-and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who built The Body Shop into a $1.37 billion-a-year operation , has demonstrated how influential a businesswoman can be when she decides to connect profits with politics-and when like-minded consumers back her up with their purchasing power . Roddick hopes The Body Shop will serve as a model and " lead the way for businesses to use their voice for social and environmental change . " ORGANIZING FOR CHANGE So much of our experience with the world has been shaped by being outsiders that we have trouble accepting and taking advantage of the fact that many of us are now power brokers and decision makers in realms that once seemed off-limits . And perhaps because so many of us are more comfortable on the inside these days , we have lost track of the continuing need to work on social problems from the outside in , as we did so effectively in our First Adulthood . The women's-health movement , which took shape in the early 70s , shows how the personal became political , and then powerful . Back when concern about how the medical establishment treated women began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pill , most women only saw male doctors , scientific studies were conducted on male subjects , and conditions peculiar to women were hardly studied at all . Drug manufacturers spoke only to government agencies ( in confidential reports and negotiations ) and to doctors , who prescribed medications but never explained why , or what the risks were . Our expertise , even about our own bodies , was disregarded along with our wishes . " You have to remember , " recalls Barbara Seaman , whose groundbreaking The Doctors ' case Against the Pill was published in 1969 and helped trigger the women's-health movement , " in those days doctors would n't let women have natural childbirth . They hit you on the head with anesthesia , and you were n't awakened until the hairdresser showed up . " We owe any mastery we have achieved over our own health management to the efforts of Seaman and her sistersin-arms . The strategy was established early on : energize a grassroots constituency ; create coalitions from smaller autonomous groups ; share strategies , contacts and information through informal but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inside of government , industry and the profession . Today , there remain urgent societal problems in need of a movement . One of them strikes particularly close to home . THE CAREGIVING CRISIS At the same time as we are generating an explosion of energy that is changing our world , we are leaving an implosion of equal force in our wake-a caregiving crisis . It is not our fault , but it is a direct result of choices we made . Traditional assumptions about a woman 's responsibility for taking care of everyone else-including the community , the school , the library , the church-have led to some painful moments in our First Adulthood . Guilt , anger and regret are intertwined with the trade-offs we made that gave us confidence and satisfaction . Now as we ease ourselves out of the " emotional management business " the caregiving system that relied on the unpaid or low-paid work of women is falling apart . Existing institutions-schools , emergency rooms , shelters , even prisons , and families themselves-were not designed or funded to handle the needs of increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The fact is , " writes political scientist Mona Harrington in Care ana Equality , " the old formulas can not yield both care and equality . They are bankrupt . And they are generating a social crisis that can not be addressed realistically until we can remove the blinders of traditional thinking and take in the whole of what is happening . " Is there anyone better positioned to remove the blinders of traditional thinking about caregiving than us ? Even when women began to break out of the domestic framework , they-we-never broke free of that traditional thinking . We tried to do it all , to hold up both halves of the universe . The struggle to balance the two has defined our generation . And that has n't changed , because the system has n't changed . Every day women are missing workand one-third of them are losing pay-to care for a sick child . Twenty percent of them do n't have health insurance . We have negotiated with men to share the load , but even two people are hard-pressed to hold a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in four , do-care for older family members or friends as well . It is even harder to stand up and say , " We ca n't and we should n't have to do this all by ourselves anymore . " " You have got to be kidding ! " I can hear both my First and second Adulthood selves protest . " I spent the first half of my adult life feeling responsible for everyone but myself . I 've finally discovered how to let go of the excesses of that experience . I 'm only just beginning to care for myself . And now I 'm supposed to get involved in creating a better system for caregiving with a capital C because I know so much about it ! " I admit there is a certain irony to the suggestion that a mission of our collective second Adulthood should be to pick up the pieces of the system that we just broke out of . But looked at another way , the same ethic of interdependence that made care for others such a priority also gives us a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Add to that what we are learning this time around about autonomy and interconnectedness-and about guilt reduction-and you have a starting point for a social policy that takes some of the caretaking responsibilities out of the individual homes and puts them into a societal framework that involves the whole community . When we ask ourselves the three primary questions of Second Adulthood-What matters ? What works ? and What 's next ? - one response to the first has to be " my community , " however each of us defines it . To the second , we already know the answer : A combination of participation , passion and power . And when we look ahead , we want to answer , " We 're working on a better way ! " Sidebar From the book Inventing the Rest of Our Lives : Women in second Adulthood , by Suzanne Braun Levine , published in January 2005 by Viking , a member of Penguin Group ( USA ) Inc . <p>                     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposite of dTja vu ? <p> Louisa Clemens stopped in consternation barely a few paces into the parlor . The room felt peculiarly different , as if she had never set foot in it before . After working six years for the Winterbottoms , she knew every inch of their parlor  --  the blue carpet patterned with roses , the chintz-covered sofas , the ormolu clock on the mantel , and the glass case full of ferns in the corner of the bay window  --  yet she felt as if she had never been there before . <p> Plastering a fatade of normality over her sudden feeling of strangeness , something different caught Louisa 's eye , and she turned her head toward the side of the room where a man stood unabashedly staring at her . He was definitely not the sort of man she would expect to see in the Winterbottoms ' parlor , ensconced among all their other guests . She faltered once again , the sensation of foreignness overcoming her . <p> It was his eyes that she noticed first , piercing eyes transfixing her with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave nothing hidden . They were dark gray , the color of cold English skies and frozen cobblestones , with only the barest hint of the deep , mysterious ink of midnight . <p> The rest of the company assembled in the room may just as well have been invisible for all the notice Louisa could spare them . Next to him , everyone else seemed utterly insignificant . He was a tempest , a hurricane , a force so powerful that it slammed against her chest until she could hardly draw a breath . Against a nature as strong as his , she would have no chance of resistance . <p> That was why the room had seemed so strange to her  --  because he was in it . His mere presence had transformed the Winterbottoms ' parlor into a room of mystery , a place Louisa no longer recognized . <p> She shivered in her light cotton gown , drew her Indian shawl closely around her shoulders , and turned her head away from danger , continuing toward the mother of the young children she chaperoned . Even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the force of his gaze on her , stripping her bare . She knew that she had all of his attention . Everything about him was focused on her , and only on her . <p> " Ah , Miss Clemens , there you are . " Mrs. Winterbottom bustled cheerfully toward Louisa , her mahogany ringlets bouncing under her cap . " I was just telling our guests about my little cherubs and here you are with them both . You have impeccable timing . " <p> Though still shaken by the peculiar feeling that lingered in her spine and the directness of the stranger 's gaze , Louisa smiled perfunctorily at her employer . " Prudence , Hester , " she said gently to the two identical twin girls who trotted at her side , " make a curtsy for your mama . " <p> The girls did as they were bid , holding out their puffed skirts and sinking into a pretty curtsy , all the while sneaking wide-eyed peeks at the guests , and at the gray-eyed stranger in particular . <p> Louisa was not surprised at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where businessmen from many parts of the world visited Mr. Winterbottom , a guest like this was most unusual . <p> She sneaked a look at him herself out of the corner of her eye , not wishing to be caught by his gaze again , or to let him guess her interest . Everything about him was different . For a start , his skin was tanned to a deep brown , even far darker than the Italians among whom they lived . His high cheekbones lent his face a severe grace , and his hair fell in thick , black waves nearly to his shoulders instead of being neatly pomaded to sit flat against his head , the style preferred by most gentlemen . <p> His clothing was as unusual as his looks . Though his navy blue jacket was cut in the usual style , it was richly decorated with heavy gold and red embroidery , and his trousers were pristine white rather than the more usual black . He wore a round , red , high cap with a black tassel that made him appear even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room were bareheaded , having removed their hats upon coming inside . He stood out among the crowd of Europeans as a wild hawk would stand out in a farmyard full of domesticated chickens . <p> The girls had dipped into a low curtsy . " Good girls , " Mrs. Winterbottom said approvingly as they straightened up again . " Now then , come and hug your mama . " <p> The pair obediently suffered a hug from their mother without undue wriggling . Inwardly , Louisa breathed a sigh of relief . Mrs. Winterbottom was a kindhearted woman and possessed the best of tempers , but the one thing she hated above all else was having her fine silk dress ruffled  --  particularly when she was in the company of handsome guests , as she was this evening . <p> There was no denying that the man who had caught Louisa 's attention was handsome in an exotic way . He was much more attractive than the pallid young Englishman with ginger sideburns paying court to one of Mrs. Winterbottom 's friends , and even more good-looking than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and terribly wealthy  --  dowager in the corner . <p> Louisa glanced over at Mr. Winterbottom as he poured sherry at the sideboard . Next to the visitor , even Mr. Winterbottom looked pale and uninteresting . She noticed for the first time that his hairline was starting to recede and that , despite his firmly buttoned waistcoat , good living had given him a slight paunch . In contrast , the stranger looked to be all hard muscle with barely an ounce of fat on him , strong and untamed , and quite out of place in this quiet , gentile setting . <p> Seeming quite unperturbed by the dangerous allure that hung about the stranger like a miasma , Mrs. Winterbottom guided her daughters toward him . " Come , my dears , make a curtsy to our guests , especially to Mr. Khair , who has come all the way from Morocco to meet you . " <p> <br> Continues ...
