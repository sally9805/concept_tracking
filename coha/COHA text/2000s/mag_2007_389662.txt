First , You Have to Want To BY DAVID GRANGER At some point in my tenure as a sportswriter , I figured out why big-time athletes disdain the vast majority of reporters . It was n't because we were small and weak . It was n't because we asked impolite questions and wrote articles they did n't like . No . It was because we dressed like shit . I came to this conclusion after seeing a photo of myself sitting in the Cincinnati Reds ' dugout interviewing their star slugger . I can still see the blue short-sleeved checked shirt I was wearing in that photo . I can still feel the rush of humiliation I felt when I realized that the superstar must have looked at me for the first time and immediately thought to himself : writer . He lumped me in . And he was n't wrong to do so . Photograph : Illustration by Andy Martin ; Jameson Simpson It 's hard to be successful if you 're lumped in . If you 're one of the many . You can get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  style  --  is about standing out ; it 's about making a subtle statement , and that statement is simply : " I 'm different . " You ca n't be so outlandish that the statement is read as either " I 'm better " or " I 'm an asshole . " There 's a fine line . Nick Sullivan , Esquire 's fashion director , has a phrase he uses to describe what it is we 're talking about : the Extra 10 Percent . There 's some guidance on these pages , advice on navigating the journey toward a personal style . But the secret to dressing a little better is simply this : You have to want to . If you do n't , it 's just not going to be part of your life . And that 's not a terrible thing . Style is a gentle act of will . I remember when I started to care . I bought a few things  --  things I could afford . A couple of dark suits , some nice shirts  --  mostly white at first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit , a gray-and-dark-gray repp . But nothing mattered until the morning I stood in front of my closet and thought about what I was going to wear . On that morning , or one soon after , I remember looking at my humble wardrobe and wanting to try something I had never tried before . I do n't remember what the combination was , but it was an important moment . It opened up possibilities . I no longer had outfits . I had options . For a while I tried dressing in threes : two patterns and a texture . I discovered that the simplest way to make people think you look sharp is to dress in black and white , especially a black suit , white-white shirt with French cuffs , and white-white pocket square . For various six-month periods , I 've entirely eschewed the tie , only to adopt it anew when the season changes . There are millions of rules . ( Always wear white to the face . The turtleneck is the most flattering thing a man can wear . ) And those rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basis , modified or rejected . I failed a lot and I still fail . Sometimes I get to the office , after dressing in the near dark of early morning , and I think , This is what I 'm wearing ? But what the stink ? It 's a day in the life . Tomorrow , I 'll spend my ninety seconds in contemplation and move on . THINGS TO CARRY WHAT EVERY MAN SHOULD HAVE IN HIS POCKETS Shirt breast pocket : Pen ( $150 ) by Tiffany .

THE SUPER SUIT THE ONE SUIT THAT WORKS FOR EVERY OCCASION A deep-navy cloth is dark enough to appear professional but also a touch lighter than funereal black . It works well with both black and brown accessories and is the perfect canvas for plain shirts and ties , as well as bolder patterns . Light wool stands up best to repeated wearings and can be worn year-round . An interesting texture like hopsack , or even a small-scale herringbone weave , lends some subtle depth to an otherwise simple suit . A fairly natural shoulder . ( Too much padding makes the suit look like it 's wearing you . ) A two-button jacket is elegant and slimming around the middle , owing to the deeper V between the lapels . Your lapel speaks volumes . A small , high notch right on the collarbone is the mark of a killer suit , a minor detail that makes your off-the-peg suit look closer to classic bespoke .
