1 I grew up in the shadow of the Lindbergh baby kidnapping . By that I mean I was born and raised in Englewood , New Jersey . In 1932 , the grandson of Englewood 's most prominent citizen , Ambassador Dwight Morrow , was kidnapped . Furthermore , the baby 's father happened to be the most famous man in the world at the time , Col. Charles Lindbergh , who had flown the first solo flight across the Atlantic Ocean in his single-engine plane , the Spirit of St. Louis . My grandmother , who was eight years old at that time , remembers the blazing headlines , the crowds of reporters who congregated outside Next Day Hill , the Morrow estate , the arrest and trial of Bruno Hauptmann . Time passed , memories faded . Today Englewood 's most prominent residence is the Carrington mansion , the stone-castlelike structure that I had stolen into as a child . All these thoughts went through my mind as , for the second time in my life , I went inside the gates of the Carrington estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six-year-old I had been . Maybe it was the memory of my father being dismissed by the Carringtons only a few weeks later that made me suddenly feel self-conscious and awkward . The bright October morning had changed into a windy , damp afternoon , and I wished that I had worn a heavier jacket . The one I had chosen now seemed much too light both in color and fabric . Instinctively , I parked my secondhand car to the side of the imposing driveway , not wanting it to be the object of anyone 's scrutiny . One hundred and eight thousand miles on the speedometer takes a lot of starch out of a car , even one recently washed and mercifully free of dents . I had twisted my hair into a bun , but the wind tore at it as I walked up the steps and rang the bell . A man who looked to be in his midfifties , with a receding hairline and narrow , unsmiling lips , opened the door . He was dressed in a dark suit , and I was n't sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I could speak , without introducing himself , he said that Mr. Carrington was expecting me and that I should come in . The wide entrance hall was illuminated by light that filtered through leaded stained-glass windows . A statue of a knight in armor stood next to a medieval tapestry depicting a battle scene . I longed to examine the tapestry , but instead I dutifully followed my escort down a corridor to the library . " Miss Lansing is here , Mr. Carrington , " he said . " I 'll be in the office . " From that remark I guessed he was an assistant . When I was little I used to draw pictures of the kind of home I 'd love to live in . One of my favorite rooms to imagine was the one in which I would read away my afternoons . In that room there was always a fireplace and bookshelves . One version included a comfortable couch , and I 'd draw myself curled up in the corner , a book in my hand . I 'm not suggesting I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew stick figures and the bookshelves were uneven , the carpet a splotched multicolored copy of one I 'd seen in the window of an antique rug store . I could not put the exact image in my mind on paper , but I knew what I wanted . I wanted the kind of room I was standing in now . Peter Carrington was seated in a wide leather chair , his feet on a hassock . The lamp on the table beside him not only illuminated the book he was reading but spotlighted his handsome profile . He was wearing reading glasses , which sat on the bridge of his nose and slipped off when he looked up . Retrieving them , he laid them on the table , removed his feet from the hassock , and stood . I had caught occasional glimpses of him in town and had seen his picture in the papers , so I had an impression of him , but being in the same room with him was different . There was a quiet authority about Peter Carrington that he retained even as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuasive letter , Kathryn Lansing . " " Thank you for letting me stop in , Mr. Carrington . " His handshake was firm . I knew he was studying me just as I was studying him . He was taller than I had realized , with the narrow body of a runner . His eyes were more gray than blue . His thin , even-featured face was framed by dark brown hair that was a shade long but which suited him well . He was wearing a dark brown cardigan with a rust thread running through the weave . If I had been asked to guess his job from his appearance alone , I would have said college professor . I knew he was forty-two years old . That meant he would have been about twenty the day that I crept into this house . I wondered if he had been home for that party . It was possible , of course  --  in late August he might not yet have gone back to Princeton , where he had been a student . Or , if he had already started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Princeton was only an hour-and-a-half drive away . He invited me to sit down in one of the two matching armchairs near the fireplace . " I 've been wanting an excuse to have a fire , " he said . " This afternoon the weather cooperated . " I was more than ever conscious of the fact that my lime green jacket was more suitable to an August afternoon than to midautumn . I felt a strand of hair slip over my shoulder and tried to twist it back into the bun that was supposed to anchor it . I have a master 's in library science , my passion for books having made that a natural career choice . Since graduation five years ago , I 've been working at the Englewood Public Library and am heavily involved in our community 's literacy project . Now I was in this impressive library , " with my hat in my hand , " as my grandmother would say . I was planning a fundraiser for the literacy program and wanted to make it spectacular . There was one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred dollars for a cocktail reception , and that would be if it were held in this house . The Carrington mansion had become part of the folklore of Englewood and the surrounding communities . Everyone knew its history and that it had been transported from Wales . I was certain that the prospect of being inside it would make all the difference in whether or not we could have a sellout event . I usually feel pretty comfortable in my own skin , but sitting there , sensing that those gray eyes were taking my measure , I felt flustered and ill at ease . Suddenly I felt , once again , like the daughter of the landscaper who drank too much . Get over it , I told myself , and stop with the " gee-whiz " nonsense . Giving myself a brisk mental shake , I began my well-rehearsed solicitation . " Mr. Carrington , as I wrote you , there are many good causes , meaning many reasons for people to write checks . Of course it 's impossible for anyone to support everything . Quite frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's why it 's essential to our event to find a way to get people to write a check for us . " That was when I launched into my plea for him to allow us to have a cocktail party in this house . I watched as his expression changed , and I saw the " no " word forming on his lips . He put it gracefully . " Miss Lansing , " he began . " Please call me Kay . " " I thought your name was Kathryn . " " On my birth certificate and to my grandmother . " He laughed . " I understand . " Then he began his polite refusal . " Kay , I 'd be happy to write a check . . . " I interrupted him . " I 'm sure you would . But as I wrote , this is more than just about money . We need volunteers to teach people how to read , and the best way to get them is to make them want to come to an affair , and then sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promised to reduce his price if the event is held here . It would just be for two hours , and it would mean so much to so many people . " " I have to think about it , " Peter Carrington said as he stood up . The meeting was over . I thought quickly and decided there was nothing to lose by adding one final thing : " Mr. Carrington , I 've done of lot of research about your family . For generations this was one of the most hospitable homes in Bergen County . Your father and grandfather and great-grandfather supported local community activities and charities . By helping us now , you could do so much good , and it would be so easy for you . " I had no right to feel so terribly disappointed , but I did . He did n't respond , and without waiting for him or his assistant to show me out , I retraced my steps to the door . I did pause to take a quick glance to the back of the house , thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I left , sure that I had made my second and final visit to the mansion . Two days later Peter Carrington 's picture was on the cover of Celeb , a national weekly gossip rag . It showed him coming out of the police station twenty-two years ago , after being questioned about the disappearance of eighteen-year-old Susan Althorp , who had vanished following the formal dinner dance she had attended at the Carrington mansion . The blaring headline , IS SUSAN ALTHORP STILL ALIVE ? , was followed by the caption under Peter 's picture : " Industrialist still a suspect in the disappearance of debutante Susan Althorp , who would be celebrating her fortieth birthday this week . " The magazine had a field day rehashing details of the search for Susan and , since her father had been an ambassador , comparing the case to the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby . The article included a summary of the circumstances surrounding the death of Peter Carrington 's pregnant wife , Grace , four years ago . Grace Carrington , known for drinking heavily , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker . Carrington had arrived home after a twenty-three-hour flight from Australia , observed her condition , grabbed the glass out of her hand , dumped the contents on the carpet , and angrily demanded , " Ca n't you have a little mercy on the child you 're carrying ? " Then , claiming exhaustion , he went up to bed . In the morning , the housekeeper found the body of Grace Carrington , still dressed in a satin evening suit , at the bottom of the swimming pool . An autopsy showed that she was three times over the limit of being legally drunk . The article concluded , " Carrington claimed he went to sleep immediately and did not awaken until the police responded to the 911 call . MAYBE . We 're conducting an opinion poll . Go to our Web site and let us know what you think . " A week later , at the library , I received a call from Vincent Slater , who reminded me that I had met him when I had an appointment with Peter Carrington . " Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permit the use of his home for your fund-raiser . He suggests that you coordinate the details of the event with me. "
