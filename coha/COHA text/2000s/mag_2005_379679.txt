I recently turned 60 . To help celebrate the occasion , friends organized a surprise party . After the festivities , there came a time to reflect , and I came to an uncomfortable conclusion : I am closer to that period in life when my energy and powers will diminish and I will lose my independence . At age 60 , the organs of the body gradually begin to fail and the first hints of age-related disease begin to appear . <P> I hardly notice my aging on a day-to-day basis . When I look in the mirror each morning , my face and white beard seem the same as the day before . But in photographs from the 1970s , my beard is completely black . On closer inspection , I notice other changes in my body : more aches and pains , less resilience , less vigor . And my memory may not be quite what it used to be . At the same time , despite the evidence , some part of me feels unchanged . In fact , I feel the same as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to my 25th high school reunion . I had not seen most of my classmates since our graduation in 1959 . A few were just as I remembered them , hardly changed at all . Others looked so aged that I could barely find points of coincidence with the pictures of them I had in my head . Why the difference ? Why are some individuals so outwardly altered by time and others not ? Or , in other words , why is there often a discrepancy between chronological age and biological age ? <P> I believe the answer has to do with complex interactions of genetics and environment . I also believe , on the basis of evidence I have reviewed , we actually have control over some of those factors . <P> I do not subscribe to the view that aging suddenly overtakes us at some point in life , whether at 60 or some other milestone . I meet researchers , physicians and others who believe that we are born , grow rapidly to maturity , and then coast along on a more or less comfortable plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of decline senescence and consider it distinct and apart from what came before . <P> I find it more useful to think of aging as a continuous and necessary process of change that begins at conception . Wherever you are on the continuum , it is important to learn how to live in appropriate ways in order to maximize health and happiness . That should be an essential goal for all of us . What is appropriate when you are in your 20s is likely not going to be appropriate in your 50s . <P> We can mask the outward signs of the process or try to keep up old routines in spite of it , but we can not change the fact that we are all moving toward physical change . The best we can do  --  and it is a lot  --  is to accept the inevitability of aging and try to adapt to it , to be in the best health we can at any age . To my mind the denial of aging and the attempt to fight it are counterproductive , a failure to understand and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are major obstacles to aging gracefully . <P> Which brings me to the subject of antiaging medicine . <P> THE ANTIAGING BUSINESS <P> Antiaging medicine is nothing new . What is remarkable , though , is its growth into an organized field , with journals , annual meetings and a concerted attempt by leaders to have it recognized as a legitimate specialty of orthodox medicine .
