The Zero Game By Brad Meltzer Warner Books Forty-four Steps , Inc . I DO N'T BELONG HERE . I have n't for years . When I first came to Capitol Hill to work for Congressman Nelson Cordell , it was different . But even Mario Andretti eventually gets bored driving two hundred miles an hour every single day . Especially when you 're going in a circle . I 've been going in circles for eight years . Time to finally leave the loop . " We should n't be here , " I insist as I stand at the urinal . " What 're you talking about ? " Harris asks , unzipping his fly at the urinal next to mine . He has to crane his neck up to see my full lanky frame . At six feet four inches , I 'm built like a palm tree and staring straight down at the top of his messy black hair . He knows I 'm agitated , but as always , he 's the perfect calm in the storm . " C'm on , Matthew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He thinks I 'm worried about the bathroom . For once , he 's wrong . This may be the rest room right across from the Floor of the House of Representatives , and it may have a sign on the door that says , Members Only-as in Members of Congress ... as in them ... as in not us-but after all this time here , I 'm well aware that even the most formal Members wo n't stop two staffers from taking awhiz . " Forget the bathroom , " I tell Harris . " I 'm talking about the Capitol itself . We do n't belong anymore . I mean , last week I celebrated eight years here , and what do I have to show for it ? A shared office and a Congressman who , last week , pressed himself up against the Vice President to make sure he did n't get cropped out of the photo for the next day 's newspaper . I 'm thirty-two years old-it 's just not fun anymore . " " Fun ? You think this is about fun , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ? " he asks , motioning with his chin to the Dr. Seuss Lorax pin on the lapel of my navy blue suit . As usual , he knows just where the pressure points are . When I started doing environmental work for Congressman Cordell , my five-year-old nephew gave me the pin to let me know how proud he was . I am the Lorax-I speak for the trees , he kept saying , reciting from memory the book I used to read to him . My nephew 's now thirteen . Dr. Seuss is just a writer of kids ' books to him , but for me , even though it 's just a trinket ... when I look at the tiny orange Lorax with the fluffy blond mustache ... some things still matter . " That 's right , " Harris says . " The Lorax always fights the good fight . He speaks for the trees . Even when it 's not fun . " " You of all people should n't start with that . " " That 's not a very Lorax response , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you think , LaRue ? " he says , turning to the older black man who 's permanently stationed at the shoeshine chair right behind us . " Never heard of the Lorax , " LaRue responds , his eyes locked on the small TV that plays C-SPAN above the door . " Always been a Horton Hears a Who guy myself . " He looks off in the distance . " Cute little elephant ... " Before Harris can add another mile to the guilt trip , the swinging doors to the rest room bang open , and a man with a gray suit and red bow tie storms inside . I recognize him instantly : Congressman William E. Enemark from Colorado-dean of the House , and Congress 's longest-serving Member . Over the years , he 's seen everything from desegregation and the Red Scare , to Vietnam and Watergate , to Lewinsky and Iraq . But as he hangs his jacket on the hand-carved coat-rack and rushes toward the wooden stall in back , he does n't see us . And as we zip up our flies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " That 's my point , " I whisper to Harris . " What ? Him ? " he whispers back , motioning to Enemark 's stall . " The guy 's a living legend , Harris . Y'know how jaded we must be to let him walk by without saying hello ? " " He 's going to the can ... " " You can still say hello , right ? " Harris makes a face , then motions over to LaRue , who raises the volume on C-SPAN . Whatever Harris is about to say , he does n't want it heard . " Matthew , I hate to break it to you , but the only reason you did n't throw him a Hi , Congressman is because you think his environmental record is crap . " It 's hard to argue with that . Last year , Enemark was the number one recipient of campaign money from the timber , oil , and nuclear power industries . He 'd clear-cut Oregon , hang billboards in the Grand Canyon , and vote to pave over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd get him some cash . " But even so , if I were a twenty-two-year-old just out of college , I still would 've stuck my hand out for a quick Hi , Congressman . I 'm telling you , Harris , eight years is enough-the fun 's long gone . " Still standing at the urinal , Harris stops . His green eyes narrow , and he studies me with that same mischievous look that once got me thrown in the back of a police car when we were undergrads at Duke . " C'm on , Matthew , this is Washington , D.C.-fun and games are being played everywhere , " he teases . " You just have to know where to find them . " Before I can react , his hand springs out and grabs the Lorax pin from my lapel . He glances at LaRue , then over to the Congressman 's jacket on the coat-rack . " What 're you doing ? " " Cheering you up , " he promises . " Trust me , you 'll love it . No lie . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite turn of phrase-and the first sign of guaranteed trouble . I flush my urinal with my elbow . Harris flushes his with a full-on grip . He 's never been afraid to get his hands dirty . " How much will you give me if I put it on his lapel ? " he whispers , holding up the Lorax and moving toward Enemark 's coat . " Harris , do n't ... " I hiss . " He 'll kill you . " " Wan na bet ? " There 's a hollow rumble of spinning toilet paper from within the stall . Enemark 's almost finished . As Harris shoots me a smile , I reach for his arm , but he sidesteps my grip with his usual perfect grace . It 's how he operates in every political fight . Once he 's focused on a goal , the man 's unstoppable . " I am the Lorax , Matthew . I speak for the trees ! " He laughs as he says the words . Watching him slowly tiptoe toward Enemark 's jacket , I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dumb stunt , but if he pulls it off ... I take that back . Harris does n't fail at anything . That 's why , at twenty-nine years old , he was one of the youngest chiefs of staff ever hired by a Senator . And why , at thirty-five , there 's no one-not even the older guys-who can touch him . I swear , he could charge for some of the stuff that comes out of his mouth . Lucky me , old college friends get it for free . " How 's the weather look , LaRue ? " Harris calls to Mr. Shoeshine , who , from his seat near the tiled floor , has a better view of what 's happening under the stall . If it were anyone else , LaRue would tattle and run . But it is n't anyone else . It 's Harris . " Bright and sunny , " LaRue says as he ducks his head down toward the stall . " Though a storm 's quickly approaching ... " Harris nods a thank-you and straightens his red tie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them outside the subway . As chief of staff for Senator Paul Stevens , he should be wearing something nicer , but the way Harris works , he does n't need to impress . " By the way , LaRue , what happened to your mustache ? " " Wife did n't like it-said it was too Burt Reynolds . " " I told you , you ca n't have the mustache and the Trans Am-it 's one or the other , " Harris adds . LaRue laughs , and I shake my head . When the Founding Fathers set up the government , they split the legislative branch into two sides : the House and the Senate . I 'm here in the House , which is in the south half of the Capitol . Harris works in the Senate , which is all the way over on the north . It 's a whole different world over there , but somehow , Harris still remembers the latest update on our shoeshine guy 's facial hair . I do n't know why I 'm surprised . Unlike the monsters who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a political maneuver . He does it because that 's his gift-as the son of a barber , he 's got the gift of gab . And people love him for it . That 's why , when he walks into a room , Senators casually flock around him , and when he walks into the cafeteria , the lunch lady gives him an extra ladle of chicken in his burrito . Reaching Enemark 's gray suit jacket , Harris pulls it from the coat-rack and fishes for the lapel . The toilet flushes behind us . We all spin back toward the stall . Harris is still holding the jacket . Before any of us can react , the door to the stall swings open . If we were brand-new staffers , this is where we 'd panic . Instead , I bite the inside of my cheek and take a deep gulp of Harris 's calm . Old instincts kick in . As the door to the stall opens , I go to step in front of the Congressman . All I have to do is buy Harris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's moving too quickly . Sidestepping me without even looking up , Enemark is someone who avoids people for a living . Leaving the stall , he heads straight for the coat-rack . If Harris is caught with his jacket ... " Congressman ... ! " I call out . He does n't slow down . I turn to follow , but just as I spin around , I 'm surprised to see Enemark 's gray coat hanging lifelessly on the coat-rack . There 's a sound of running water on the right side of the room . Harris is washing his hands by the sink . Across from him , LaRue rests his chin in his palm , studying C-SPAN with his fingers covering his mouth . See no evil , hear no evil , speak no evil . " Excuse me ? " Enemark asks , taking his coat from the rack . The way it 's draped over his forearm , I ca n't see the lapel . The pin 's nowhere in sight . I glance over at Harris , who 's wearing a calm that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squint , and his dark black eyebrows seem to take over his face . Japanese is easier to read . " Son , did you say something ? " Enemark repeats . " We just wanted to say hello , sir , " Harris interrupts , leaping to my aid . " Really , it 's an honor to meet you . Is n't that right , Matthew ? " " A-Absolutely , " I say . Enemark 's chest rises at the compliment . " Much appreciated . " " I 'm Harris ... Harris Sandler ... " he says , introducing himself even though Enemark did n't ask . Leaving the sink , Harris studies the Congressman like a chessboard . It 's the only way to stay ten moves ahead . The Congressman extends a handshake , but Harris pulls away . " Sorry ... wet hands ... " he explains . " By the way , Congressman , this is Matthew Mercer . He does Interior Approps for Congressman Cordell . " " Sorry to hear that , " Enemark jabs with a fake laugh as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he opens his coat and slides an arm into the sleeve . I check the lapel . There 's nothing there . " Have a good day , sir , " Harris says as Enemark slides his other arm in . Enemark rotates his shoulder blades and pulls his suit jacket into place . When the other half of the jacket hits his chest , a tiny flash of light catches my eye . There ... on his other lapel ... there 's a tiny American flag pin ... a little triangle with an oil well on it ... and the Lorax , whose big Dr. Seuss eyes smile at me . I motion to Harris ; he looks up and finally grins . When I was a freshman at Duke , Harris was a senior . He got me into the fraternity and , years later , got me my first job here on the Hill . Mentor then , hero now . " Look at that , " Harris says to the Congressman . " I see you 're wearing the logging mascot . " I turn toward LaRue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself from laughing . " Yeah ... I guess , " Enemark barks , checking the Lorax out for himself . Anxious to be done with the small talk , the Congressman leaves the bathroom and heads across the hallway to the House Floor . None of us moves until the door closes . " The logging mascot ? " I finally blurt . " I told you there 's still fun going on , " Harris says , looking up at the small TV and checking out C-SPAN . Just another day at work . " I got ta tell Rosey this one ... " LaRue says , rushing out of the room . " Harris , they 're gon na catch you sooner or later . " " Only if they outthink us , " Harris replies as the door again slams shut . I continue to laugh . Harris continues to study C-SPAN . " You notice Enemark did n't wash his hands ? " he asks . " Though that did n't stop him from shaking yours . " I look down at my own open palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Here 's the clip for the highlight reel ... " Harris calls out , pointing up at C-SPAN . On-screen , Congressman Enemark approaches the podium with his usual old-cowboy swagger . But if you look real close-when the light hits him just right-the Lorax shines like a tiny star on his chest . " I 'm Congressman William Enemark , and I speak for the people of Colorado , " he announces through the television . " That 's funny , " I say . " I thought he spoke for the trees ... " To my surprise , Harris does n't smile . He just scratches at the dimple in his chin . " Feeling better ? " he asks . " Of course-why ? " He leans against the inlaid mahogany wall and never takes his eyes off the TV . " I meant what I said before . There really are some great games being played here . " " You mean games like this ? " " Something like this . " There 's a brand-new tone in his voice . All serious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Matthew , it 's right in front of your face , " he says with a rare glimpse of rural Pennsylvania accent . I give him a long , hard look and rub the back of my sandy-blond hair . I 'm a full head taller than him . But he 's still the only person I look up to in this place . " What 're you saying , Harris ? " " You wanted to bring the fun back , right ? " " Depends what kinda fun you 're talking about . " Pushing himself off the wall , Harris grins and heads for the door . " Trust me , it 'll be more fun than you 've had in your entire life . No lie .
