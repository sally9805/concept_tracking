Chapter One Negril , Jamaica January 24 , 1994 In the darkness , something soft and wet slid across Naomi 's mouth . Her eyes flickered closed and her mouth opened to receive the sacrament of a stranger 's desire . Darkness nuzzled against her body in the canopied bed and skated across the sensitive surface of her skin . A sensation of pain floated down her throat . The pain was slight , but its hidden layer of pleasure made Naomi arch up in the bed in surprise , her lips parted and eager . She could n't see the woman 's face , only felt bare skin pressed against hers , the fullness of soft breasts , and the rasp of lush pubic hairs against her skin . Fingers swirled closer to her clit , and Naomi moaned . The slow torture made her hips dance across the sheets , undulating against the smooth cotton that was softer than any she 'd ever felt before . " You are so beautiful , " the woman , Julia , said against her belly . Her cool breath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was what she 'd always wanted . The sure caress of another woman , hands settling on her hips with authority and intent , mouth falling on her nipples like cool rain . Naomi moaned and touched the back of Julia 's head . She smelled like jasmine . The scent curled inside Naomi , slipping into her nose , her head , and her body until all of her awareness was focused on this woman makinglove to her in a strange bed . Julia 's thighs fell between hers , widening them , spreading Naomi for the breeze from the open windows to caress her . Then it was Julia 's fingers , cool and light , against her aching clit . The fingers strummed over Naomi , played her , until her hips made a bow in the bed and her own fingers clenched in the sheets . Naomi 's body was drenched in sweat , swimming in its desire . Julia smiled down at her , a sweet spreading of lips that was at odds with the wicked things her fingers did to Naomi 's pussy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aching need that lanced through her with each movement of Julia 's fingers . Her eyelashes fluttered , the muscles in her belly clenched , and her chest rose and fell with each gasping breath that Julia pulled from her . Julia stopped smiling . The benevolence peeled abruptly from her face , leaving a visage tight with hunger . Her fingers still moved sweetly inside Naomi , moving with ease in liquid heat , her thumb licked at Naomi 's clit until all she wanted was the completion that the waves of sensation promised . The volcano in her pussy erupted . Molten light danced behind Naomi 's tightly clenched eyes as her body jerked on the bed , plucked into ecstasy by Julia 's expert hand . " Now it 's my turn . " She barely heard the low whisper , only felt the cool breath on her neck again , then a fire at her throat that was swooning delight and unexpected pain . Naomi gasped . Julia crouched above her , the jasmine scent that was more than her perfume suffocatingly sweet as her bald head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly on vulnerable flesh . Naomi pushed at Julia 's arms , but the woman was an immovable weight above her . " No ! " The lassitude from her orgasm abruptly fell away and she pushed harder . Julia hooked her teeth more firmly in Naomi 's throat . Pain ripped through her . " No ! " She screamed her denial again , but Julia only moaned , a soft , singing sound of pleasure that raised the hairs on the back of her lover 's neck . She grasped Naomi 's arms , lifting her up and off the bed as she knelt in the soft mattress , devouring . Blood dripped down Naomi 's neck , snaking down her shoulder before falling drop by precious drop to the white sheets . She felt as if she was being drained of everything-life , blood , consciousness . Her head flopped weakly back and still Julia continued to drink her . " Stop . Please . I do n't want this . " At least that 's what she tried to say , but all she managed was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they were worse than useless . They dangled from her shoulders , dragging against the sheets as Julia suckled from her neck . The sound of her feeding , wet sucking sounds that moments before Naomi had associated with sex , attacked her ears . This was n't something that she could stop . This was no longer an act she could say no to . The moment she had walked into this hotel room she had said yes . Her body had screamed it , her breasts whispered it , and her pussy , eagerly salivating for Julia 's hand , had given the ultimate permission . Naomi blinked frantically at the ceiling , her eyes already clouding with approaching death ... Chapter Two Naomi was dead . She did n't know where the knowledge came from , it was just there . Nothing in the alley moved , nothing inside her moved . She forced herself to take a deep breath . Nothing . A trembling hand rose , then fell with a wet slap against her chest . The cool flesh felt torn and sticky with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moments of memory . The laughing yawn of teeth , blood-flecked and merciless . Clawed fingers hooked into the vulnerable skin of her arms . Her rising screams . Then blood trickling over her lips , setting her senses aflame . The last place she remembered being , the palatial Negril Hotel where her sister worked , with its shimmering blue pool and equally sparkling tourists , was nowhere in sight . Instead , she lay propped up in a stinking alley , made filthier with stagnant gray water , garbage , and the smell of stale piss . The smells overwhelmed her , stinging her nose with their pungency . Only two things were the same . It was dark . And she was naked . Her back shifted against the damp concrete wall , setting off a chain reaction of pain through her entire body . Another set of smells stirred up . Fear . Vomit . Gunpowder . Death . Naomi retched into a pothole until her stomach seized up and cramped . Her limp hands twitched and slapped at her thighs . It was so quiet inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her body purging itself , the silence frightened her . No heartbeat . No breath . No pulse to reassure her that she was scared . Naomi sagged against the wall , whimpering like a beaten dog while her vision swam as she became aware of yet another layer of pain , a scraping rawness that crawled up her throat , settling into her mouth and teeth . Her back jerked away from the wall . " You all right , girl ? " A hand touched her shoulder and , through her pain-filled haze Naomi grabbed it . And kept grabbing until the person's-a man's-screams joined hers . She buried her pain in his , tore at him until his blood splashed over her in a scarlet wave . The first incidental spill of blood across her lips and tongue lanced fire through her . Suddenly the pain in her body seemed for a purpose . She grasped more tightly at the man and began to bite and suck at his body-his wrists , face , and neck-until he was covered in teeth marks and the only blood left was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vessel away and it fell in the street like an empty wine gourd . Her body shuddered with its new strength . Naomi wiped her mouth on the back of her hand and stood up . Despite her throat 's soreness and the uncertainty of her balance , she felt vital and strong . Her mind did n't bother to grapple with the contradiction . It was late . She was certain about that . The quarter moon burned against a sky strong with stars , but daylight was close . Something inside her flinched at the knowledge . Beyond her little alley , the street was teeming with traffic . People on foot , in cars , on motorcycles and bicycles . She could smell them . Their scent was so different from her own , like soft-fleshed fruit whose juice made her tongue swell and water . She made herself turn away from the contemplation of her next meal . The odor of the city and its thick traffic so late at night told her that she was inland and miles away from Julia 's Negril Hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sin . That 's why she was here now , miles away from her mother and her baby . She hoped they were safe in bed at her sister 's . Her skin suddenly yearned to touch them , to feel them close . She held on to that desire , needing it to feel connected , to feel human . Naomi needed clothes . The man 's uniform was out of the question . She could n't very well walk around town wearing a bloody and torn police corporal 's uniform . But she could n't parade around naked either . Naomi compromised by putting on the long undershirt and little briefs that fit her like a bathing suit . The night was balmy , with winds that teased her new skin like breath . Her hunger was far away now so she was free to feel . Voices reached out at her from the street , raised in greeting , in quarrel , in affection . She wanted that again . She wanted to live again . But right now she wanted clothes more . Naomi stepped out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switching her small skirted hips while her breasts moved in a seductive rhythm under her sparkling blouse . Her gaze appraised Naomi 's improvised outfit , and apparently found it lacking . The girl cut her eyes at Naomi and brushed past her . Or at least tried to . " Good evening , sistren , " Naomi greeted in a new purring voice . The woman inhaled deeply as if smelling something particularly sweet ; then she smiled . People moved in , ebbing around them , some looking at Naomi with interest , others with sneers . But she was n't concerned about them . Naomi used the buffeting crowd as an excuse to pull the woman aside and away . The mouth of the alley opened up to receive them . She had tried to use some patchouli heavy perfume to mask her true womanly scent , but Naomi found it and greedily inhaled it . She was a nice-looking woman . One of those types Naomi had always seen in the streets of town-whether Negril or Ochi-and longed to be . She imagined that women like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't long to touch other women the way that Naomi wanted . This woman 's life must be so simple , uncomplicated by forbidden desires and the pain of wanting more than she had . " Can I have your clothes ? " Naomi asked . " What ? " " I said , " Naomi said , moving even closer , " your clothes are pretty . " She touched the woman 's blouse , incidentally caressing the swell of breast beneath the cloth . " Can I have them ? " The woman drew a quick breath . Naomi did n't give her a chance to do anything more . She grabbed the woman and swung her abruptly into the wall . Her head connected sharply with the filthy , graffiti-scrawled brick before she could scream . The woman 's fear rose up hot and ripe in the alley before she abruptly lost consciousness . She smelled so good . So intoxicating . Naomi tugged off the woman 's blouse , and her unbound breasts , brown and soft in the sickly yellow streetlight , had Naomi on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself . The unconscious woman 's blood smell made her hungry , though she should n't have been , and the sight of her nakedness made her wet even though that should n't have been either . Naomi abruptly pulled back . No . She would not be like that beast who took advantage of her and made her into this . She tugged off the woman 's skirt , then covered her with the long shirt she discarded . Naomi also left her with the shoes . The boots she had taken from the policeman were better than those fragile stilettos . Even lying in the street , in the shadow of a garbage bin , the woman was still beautiful . Her breasts , the curve of her belly , the thickly pumping blood just beneath her skin made it hard for Naomi to turn away . But she did . She was nothing like the bitch who lured her to death . This was proof of that . With the stolen woman 's clothes on her back and an indefinable need gnawing at her belly , Naomi fled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward a place , any place , that could quiet her raging mind . Minutes or hours later , she was on an unfamiliar beach . Naomi wandered down to the sand , past empty stalls with signs advertising FRESH STEAMED FISH and past bits of debris abandoned by the past day 's fishermen-an old swimming fin half submerged in the water along with pieces of string and a broken knife handle adrift on the sand . The waves lapped over her toes , foamed and gentle . Her senses swallowed the sea 's salt tang and the scent of something else on the breeze . " You are beautiful . " Her body quieted . But not in surprise . Its surrender to stillness was like a kind of relief . She felt a coolness at her back , then the press of lips against the top of her spine . " I knew you would make it . " Her body relaxed into the presence , sagged against it . Julia . Her mouth sighed the name . Then anger rose up . She growled and spun to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smaller than Naomi remembered , with velvet midnight skin and a slightly paler mouth , molten brown eyes , and a bald head . Julia looked blameless and completely absent of sin as she lay under Naomi 's snarling ferocity . Then she smiled . " Come on , do it . You need to . " Her jasmine scent reached up to wrap itself around Naomi , enfolding her in its sweet embrace . She wanted to taste her skin , to break it and slip inside her until this unsettled feeling was gone . Naomi growled again . She needed to drink more of the fervid blood Julia had fed her in their shared bed . The new vampire slammed the woman into the sand and mounted her unresisting body . Julia bared her throat . " This is what you want . " Her blood was ambrosia . Spicy . And hot . It flooded into Naomi 's body in a rush , washing her with power and joy . Under her , Julia chuckled , encouraging her to take more , to suck until she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " Naomi intended to feed well too . She pulled deeply at the soft flesh under her mouth , her body unconsciously undulating over Julia , until the pleasure from her feeding and the tingles of arousal tripping across her flesh were one and the same . Julia 's hand clenched in her hair , alternately pulling and pushing at Naomi . Soft gasps tumbled from the vampire 's open mouth . Because she could be nothing else , a leech who fed on blood and secret desires . Naomi had seen enough American television to know . Julia 's legs widened and Naomi 's thigh easily fell between them and curled up until it slid against the slippery slit under the dress . Her own body burned brushfire hot . Still sucking , she pulled at her own blouse , ripping away the stolen clothes in her haste to be naked , to find a relief from the heat building inside her . A cooling breeze rippled over her naked skin , but still she burned . Julia 's gasps grew louder with each pull of Naomi 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hands tightened . Julia 's orgasm jetted more blood into Naomi 's open mouth , but still she could n't stop . The smaller woman began to fight her , to push at her shoulders , pull her heavy hair , and even buck under Naomi 's heavier body . She started to make desperate mewling noises . " Stop- ! " Naomi ignored her and sucked harder . Then something plucked her from her feast and sent her sailing through the air . She landed in the sea with a massive splash , and a different salty wetness filled her open mouth . Naomi choked and tried to catch her breath before she remembered that she did n't need to breathe anymore . " Stop means stop , puppy . You do n't want to kill her , do you ? " Naomi looked up from her sprawl in the water and flipped her heavy wet hair out of her face . " She 's dead already anyway , " she said . The vampire who 'd spoken looked down at her with contempt , then shook her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sand . This beast was even taller than Naomi , quite an accomplishment since at almost six feet she 'd always been considered ridiculously tall by most . " And you , " she said , reaching down to help Julia stand up . " Why did you give this thing your blood ? You should have drained it and left it to die . " " But , Silvija , she- " Julia 's head snapped back from the force of the giant 's sudden slap . She rocked back on her heels with a blossom of blood appearing abruptly at the corner of her mouth , but she did not fall . Silvija 's grip on her collar saw to that . Naomi watched them for a moment before dropping back into the water with a splash . She felt divine . (
