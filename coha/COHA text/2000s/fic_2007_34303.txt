Chapter 1 Leta was completely baffled by the human world as she stared into the mirrors around her that showed the daily events taking place in the realm of man . Her gaze chased from mirror to mirror as she tried to make sense of the flickering images of people from all over the world . She was beginning to suspect that she 'd made a horrible mistake by putting herself in stasis while waiting for Dolor to stir . Everything had changed . Everything . There were complicated **26;480;TOOLONG she could n't even begin to fathom . And the languages had changed so much . . . She had to focus to understand the rapidly spoken words , which were riddled with colloquialisms and slang that flew past her understanding . Her head ached from the strain of it all . " Give yourself time . " She turned to find her older brother M'Adoc behind her . For a creature whose emotions had been brutally taken from her , she felt her heart stirring at his approach . It was a muted joy that only reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phantom emotions were better than no emotions at all . Tall and lithe like her , M'Adoc had black , wavy hair and eyes so pale a blue they were almost luminescent . She held her hand out to him . " It'sgood to see you again , brother . " There was the subtlest of softening in his gaze as he took her hand and brought it to his lips . Leta flinched as an unbidden and unexpected image of his being tortured went through her . Even after thousands of years , she could still hear his screams . And her own . As if he knew her thoughts , M'Adoc gathered her into his arms . He cupped her head in his hand and held her face against his shoulder . Leta gasped as he passed onto her the knowledge of the changed world and how it worked . " You have set yourself a herculean task , little sister , " he breathed against her hair . " You should have stayed with the rest of us and not isolated yourself . " " I could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all emotionless when she remembered the way they 'd been before Zeus had punished them . The only emotion Zeus had left them with was pain , so that he could control and punish the gods of sleep , and that never-ending pain had eaten a hole inside her . It was a cold world she 'd been forced to live in and that as much as anything else was why she 'd been just as content to sleep through eternity . She stepped back from M'Adoc so that she could meet his gaze . " I have to stop him . " " He 's not the only god of pain . Pain permeates everything in our world and that of man . " " I know . But he is ultimate suffering . It 's not enough to make his victims cry . He destroys them , mind , body , and soul . You were n't there , brother . . . you did n't see . " Still , he flinched as if he could in fact see her memories . " Everyone does what they feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choices . Does n't mean I agree with them . " His gaze sharpened before he spoke again . " Dolor will kill you if he gets the chance . " She let one side of her mouth curl up into the semblance of a bitter smile . " Good . I relish the fight just as I will relish the feel of his heart in my fist as I crush the life out of him . " M'Adoc inclined his head to her . " Then I leave you to your plans for revenge . . . except for one thing . " " That is ? " His eyes were haunting . " It 's not the pain that 's inflicted on us by others that destroys us . It 's the pain we let inside our hearts that does that . Do n't let the human 's anger become yours . It can drive you mad if you do . " And with those sage words spoken , he vanished . Leta drew a deep breath as she considered what he 'd said . She knew he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two entirely different things . She needed Aidan 's anger . She wanted it . Closing her eyes , she focused on the target . Aidan . He was asleep in his bed , dreaming that he was lost in a thundering storm . The rain slashed painfully against his skin as he trudged along . His breathing was ragged , his handsome face contorted by rage . Leta was baffled by his actions . By his will to carry on even as lightning struck the ground , barely missing him . The static from the blasts caused his hair to rise and fan out around his steely features . It was a feral determination that carried him onward . And before she even realized what she 'd done , she 'd stepped through the portal and entered the dream beside him . He froze in place as he became aware of her . The cold rain pelted her flesh , plastering her hair against her body as she watched him curiously . In this state , all of his emotions were laid bare to her . She could feel every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for revenge . It was so close to her own feelings that it fed her powers and brought her emotions back with a clarity so crisp , it stung . He uncoiled his arms from around his chest as he stared at her with those icy , probing eyes . " Who are you ? " " A friend , " she whispered , catching a chill from the wind that started blowing against them . He laughed bitterly . " I have no friends . I do n't want any . " " Then I 'm here to help you . " He snorted in derision . " Help me do what ? Freeze ? Or is your plan to hold me still in this storm to make sure the lightning kills me ? " Leta snapped her fingers and the rain instantly stopped . The clouds roiled above as they parted to show the sun . The rays illuminated the bleak landscape and painted it in bright greens and yellows . Aidan was n't fazed . " Neat trick . " He was a hard man to impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him to cause it . She dried their clothes and hair . " Why did you summon the rain ? " " I did n't summon shit , " he growled . " I was minding my own business when it came down on me . All I was trying to do was get through it . " " And now that it 's gone ? " He looked up at the clear blue sky above them . " It 'll be back . It always comes back and it hits you when you least expect it . " She knew he was n't just talking about the weather . " You should find shelter . " He scoffed at her . " There is n't any . The storm tears it down and leaves you naked in the hurricane , so why bother ? " And she 'd stupidly thought she was bitter . Then again , outside the dream world , she could only feel a twinge of what she felt now . Even so hers was nothing in comparison to his . His bitterness ran so deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But beneath that hostility she sensed a raw vulnerability in him . Something about him that had been crushed and yet was still struggling to survive even though he did n't want it to . It reached out to her own grieving heart and made her want to touch him . Without a second thought , she took a step forward to lay her hand to his cheek . He hissed at her like a cat before he moved away . " Do n't touch me . " " Why not ? " " I do n't want your lying kindness . Sure , you 'll smile and be so sweet to me that I 'll trust you , but the minute I do n't give you everything you want the instant you demand it , you 'll turn on me and try to crush me . You 're just like everyone else in the world . No one matters but you . " And with that , he turned and walked away . Leta crossed her arms over her chest as she watched him put distance between them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than defeat Dolor . Little did the god know that his current victim was going to be his downfall . Aidan might seem insignificant to the god , but his determination and spirit would be the fuel she needed to avenge them both . And just like Dolor , she would n't show any clemency or weakness . Nothing was going to stop her from destroying him . For once Dolor was going to know exactly what it was like to have someone come for him and leave him quivering on the ground , begging for a mercy that would never come . She could n't wait . . .
