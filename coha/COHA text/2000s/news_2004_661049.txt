<p> In just three weeks in power , Iraq 's interim Prime Minister Iyad Allawi has threatened to annihilate the country 's insurgents - and publicly mulled an amnesty for fighters who come in from the cold . He 's praised unpopular US air-strikes on Fallujah and reopened the newspaper of a renegade Shiite cleric that was shut down by the Americans . <p> And while he 's promising to shepherd Iraq to democracy , his principal public moves have been to reconstitute Iraq 's domestic spy network and pass a law that would give him martial-law powers if he deems it necessary . <p> Dr. Allawi , who spent 28 years in exile , is Iraq 's improbable new tough-guy leader . Much of his time outside the country was spent in intrigues with the likes of Britain 's MI6 and the CIA against the Hussein regime . With close ties to many of the Baath Party officials who served the old regime but also deeply reliant on the US , he has sought to blend pragmatism and threat into a cocktail that will co-opt some insurgents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His approach was perfected by one of his earliest political allies : Saddam Hussein . But , unlike his long-ago coconspirator , Allawi promises he is seeking only to get Iraq on sound enough footing to hold elections by the end of next January . <p> Yet his early political career was n't exactly a model of democratic commitment . <p> Allawi participated in coups and served time in jail for his activities . Later , he survived being axed by would-be assassins sent by Hussein , underlining his tough guy credentials . He was also the source for some of the controversial prewar intelligence that proved to be false . <p> Allawi 's past ties to Hussein , and his later close working relationship with foreign intelligence , either provide him with the contacts and guile needed to pacify a deeply fractious and unstable nation or make him wholly unsuited to the job , depending whom you talk to . <p> " We 're meant to believe that this CIA agent is independent and acts in the interests of the Iraqi people ? " says Mahdi Ahmed al-Sumaidi , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and backs the insurgency against the US presence and the interim government . <p> His aides and close friends say such criticism is badly misplaced . " This man is a great patriot , " says Colonel Imad al-Shibib , now head of the Iraqi National Accord 's political bureau . The INA is Allawi 's party . Before that , Colonel Shibib served as the director general of Iraq 's civil defense department for 15 years under Hussein . " Allawi is a man of principal , clear-minded and patient . And he knows how Iraq works . He 's not going to expand his circle of enemies unnecessarily . " <p> Indeed , Allawi is tentatively reaching out to some potential opponents . On Sunday , his office announced that the Al-Hawza newspaper of the militant Shiite cleric Moqtada Al-Sadr will be allowed to reopen . The US closed the paper in April , sparking large protests . Allawi has also met with representatives from some of the fighters in Fallujah . <p> The extent of the challenge before Allawi has been starkly illustrated in the weeks since he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bombings and assassinations has shown that the US decision to install an interim government has n't undermined the will of the insurgency . Allawi recently vowed to " annihilate " his opponents . On Sunday , a group headed by Al Qaeda ally Abu Musab al-Zarqawi offered $ 282,000 for the assassination of Allawi , according to a note on an Islamist website - part of an ongoing war of words between the two men . <p> Tough talk and dodges <p> To his friends , Allawi is just the man to back up his tough talk . But his first few weeks in power have also seen the former Baathist dodging controversy . His foreign-intelligence ties have made him an easy target from domestic opponents . <p> He has also been accused of murder . Over the weekend , Australia 's The Age newspaper cited two anonymous sources as saying they witnessed Allawi murder six alleged insurgents with a pistol at an Interior Ministry compound in mid- to late June . The report drew vigorous denials from Allawi and his aides . <p> But the story was widely believed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a draw-back . The most popular things he 's done so far have been to reinstate the death penalty and to order mass arrests of alleged criminal gang members , with police delivering public beatings to many of the suspects . <p> The first Baath coup <p> Allawi 's political career began in the early 1960s , when , as a medical student in Baghdad , he joined the Baath Party . Colonel Shibib , who joined the party at about the same time , remembers working closely with Allawi laying the groundwork among students for the first Baath coup in 1963 . <p> In the months following the Baath success , an estimated 3,000 Communist Party members and opponents of the coup were executed . " We did n't really know what " Baath " meant in those days - we just knew the government was too close to the communists , and we were all strong anticommunists , " says Shibib . <p> When a counter-coup drove the Baath from power in November of that year , Shibib remembers briefly sharing a cell with Hussein and Allawi . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that kept it in power until the US invasion last spring . Hussein personally led the purge this time , using public executions and television show trials to cow the nation . Throughout this period , Allawi remained a loyal and active party member . <p> In the early 1970s , Allawi accepted a scholarship to study in London , but continued to work with the Baath as the head of Iraqi Student Union in Europe . There , political foes in Iraq allege , he spied on fellow students for the regime . But Hussein began to grow suspicious of Allawi . <p> " The regime was starting to go after its most loyal people , " says Gen. Abdul Jalil Mohsen , an Army officer who worked undercover for the INA inside Iraq for most of the 1990s . " They were chasing Baath people and seeking either to destroy them or bring them under Saddam 's heel . Allawi rejected this and started to speak out . So this got back to Saddam . " <p> Shibib remembers the break as a dangerous time for associates of Allawi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Shibib . " One day in 1975 , Saddam came to me and said ' you know , your brother is quite close to Allawi . We 've had to remove him from the party - he 's a dangerous man and it 's dangerous for your brother to be close to him , ' " recalls Shibib . " I knew this meant trouble - this was the era of assassinations . " <p> Shibib says he sent word to Allawi to be careful , and it was at this time Allawi began to develop his ties with foreign intelligence services . In 1978 , regime assassins broke into Allawi 's London home and attacked him with an axe . He spent nearly a year in the hospital , and came out committed to fighting Hussein 's regime . <p> Opposition network <p> Over the years , he worked through back channels to develop a network of generals who were still in the country but opposed Hussein 's regime . A typical recruit was General Mohsen , who was kicked out of the Baath Party and briefly out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that many officers were sugar-coating reports from the front . His son was later killed by the regime . <p> " In 1994 , I got a letter from Allawi and it said . ' I 've set up a new company in Jordan and I 'd like you to be one of my representatives in Iraq . ' I accepted , " he says . <p> The INA would , in 1996 , participate in a disastrous coup attempt against Hussein . Its networks penetrated , dozens of its operatives were killed . And in the mid-1990s , according Patrick and Andrew Cockburn 's book " Out of the Ashes : The Resurrection of Saddam Hussein , " the INA backed a series of terrorist attacks on a cinema , the offices of the Baath Party newspaper , and a mosque that killed dozens of civilians . <p> Mohsen became a key intelligence source for the INA , which in turn handed over much of what he knew to foreign agencies . Mohsen says he heard from a contact in 2002 that a secret military project had created a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes . <p> " We did n't know what it was , but we thought it might be chemical , " he says . <p> That information turned up in Britain 's since discredited pre-war dossier on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
