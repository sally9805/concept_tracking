" Ashley ? " <p> The young woman of twenty-two slowed her walk . She heard the name called again and then she turned to look at the caller . " Ashley , " he said . " It is you . Hey , " he said . Smiling now . Ashley waited to see if she recognized the man . Well dressed and professional . A soft , almost feminine way about him . He had not called to schedule an appointment tonight . But she thought she might have remembered him from before . A convention ... ? She gave him her working smile anyway . The all-American college girl smile . <p> " Hey , " she said , her voice bright without being warm . <p> The man said , " What are you doing here ? " <p> " Just , you know , chilling . " <p> Some of them liked it when you used kids ' words . Chilling , hanging , balling . Middle-aged men with money , wanting to feel young . She could help them with that sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The man smiled at her . And some part of her recoiled at that . His toothy smile beneath his spectacles . Discomforting , even from a customer . <p> They were standing on Market Street in downtown St. Louis . A November evening , the threat of cold rain in the air . The Cardinals had won the Series a few weeks earlier and the city was relatively quiet . <p> The girl 's name was Reesa Woods , but when she was on duty she was called Ashley . She had left a hotel room at the Adam 's Mark only a few minutes earlier . The client had been an old man , older than this guy in front of her . Sixty at least . He had made a lot of money in something called options and he was from England or Australia or someplace like that . He had dressed well and he had been a gentleman . She had been with him before . Tonight , he had done it to her only once , but then asked her if she would stay with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Pay for her company . Another $450 . Ashley had agreed to do so . <p> For the second hour , the old man was back in his clothes and had actually started to lecture her about her career options . Her future . He told her that she was a courtesan , not a prostitute , and there was a difference between the two . He told her that she had been born in the wrong country and probably the wrong century . He told her that she would have made a good Frenchwoman and that he meant that in a good way . <p> Reesa " Ashley " Woods had heard this sort of thing before . An old , lonely man with money , perhaps he wanted to believe she was something more than she was . A French courtesan as opposed to a girl from Springfield , Missouri , who had simply gotten bored with small-town life and a creepy , abusive boyfriend and had left it all behind as soon as she finished high school . <p> She had enrolled in classes at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , starting with twelve hours for the semester and soon scaling it back to six because it was harder than she 'd thought it would be . She believed she was smart enough to handle the load , but she felt there was no hurry . <p> When she was twenty , she took a job as a dancer at a strip club near the airport . It paid well with tips , and after a few months of that she was asked to have a drink with an older woman who looked a little like Jacqueline Bissett . Older , but sexy and mysterious . The woman 's name was Bobbie Cafaza and she was the madam of what she said was the most exclusive escort service in the St. Louis area . One of the first questions she put to Reesa Woods was , " Are you using drugs ? Do n't lie to me , because if you do , I 'll know it . " <p> Reesa said she was not . <p> Bobbie said , " That 's good . Because I ca n't have that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At least half the girls who work at these strip clubs are addicted to coke or heroin . But I do n't see the signs with you . " <p> Reesa said she would n't touch it . <p> Bobbie Cafaza , at that time , was the madam of four escort services . But the one she had in mind for Reesa Woods was Executive Escorts , which was a part of Tia 's Flower Shop . She told Reesa that their clients were not street-corner bums but high-class : doctors , lawyers , CEOs , and politicians . She told Reesa that she had that college , fresh-girl look that the clients were after . <p> Bobbie said , " There are escorts and there are whores . I run a professional outfit . When you 're working , you wear a dress or a skirt . No shorts or pants . If you 're standing on a street corner and you look like a whore , you 're not doing it right . You need to look like you could be working for these men . Or with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their meetings . That 's what they 're paying for . The illusion . Do you have a tattoo ? " <p> " No , " Reesa said . <p> " Good . Get one and you 're fired . When can you start ? " <p> Reesa quit the strip club and started a week later . Now she had been with the Flower Shop about a year . In that time , she had netted about ninety thousand dollars , all of it tax free . She owned a secondhand Mercedes convertible and had an attractive apartment in the Central West End . She believed that her working , " Ashley " identity was separate from that of Reesa Woods . <p> Walking away from the hotel , downtown on an evening that was turning cold , was she Ashley or was she Reesa Woods wanting to get home and take a shower ? <p> The man on the street was sort of hovering around her now . " You keeping busy ? " <p> She knew what he meant by that . Asking if she was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , I was down here for a meeting . Bunch of pointy heads talking about administrative procedure . You know how that can be . " <p> " Yeah , " she said , though she had no idea what he was talking about . She was used to going along . <p> He said , " Are you busy now ? " He was smiling at her again . <p> " Well , " Reesa said , " you 're supposed to go through the agency , you know . " <p> " Oh , is that how it works ? " he said , and Reesa picked up a bit of scorn in his voice . Like he needed to tell her he was n't stupid . Creep . He said , " Ca n't you do things on your own ? " <p> Reesa sighed . " Look , I can , but . . . " <p> Jesus , he was starting to pull his hand out of his pocket . A roll of bills . <p> " Christ , " Reesa said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh . Sorry . " He put it back in his pocket . <p> " Jesus , " Reesa said . <p> " Well , " he said , " if you 're in such a hurry . " <p> Shit , Reesa thought . Bobbie fired any girl caught freelancing . Bobbie 's view was that she took good care of her girls , and if any of them thought about not reporting jobs to her , thought about skimming for themselves , they could go stand on the street corner with the rest of the whores because she 'd fire their little asses pronto . Reesa believed she would too . But hell . . . <p> Reesa said , " I can give you an hour . Okay ? That 's it . " <p> " Sounds great , " the man said . <p> He walked her to his car . He opened the door and shut it after she got into the front seat . <p> It was when she got into the car that she started to worry . Because the car did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Victoria . Stripped , utilitarian , and plain . She expected him to have a Jaguar or a BMW . A secondhand car , but the man was wearing a nice suit and a Burberry raincoat . They did n't go together . A small alarm went off then . She could hear Bobbie 's counsel from the earliest days : You sense danger , you get out of there .. . . <p> Reesa said , " Where did we meet before ? " <p> The man kept his eyes ahead , on the road . They were south of the I-64 overpass now , heading toward the loading docks beyond Laclede 's Landing . <p> The man said , " The pharmaceutical wine-and-cheese party . It was a couple of weeks ago . " <p> " Oh , " she said . And now she was looking at him again . " So you 're a doctor ? " <p> He nodded , smiling again . Pleased with himself . <p> And Reesa said , " Is this your car ? " <p> " It 's a loaner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And she could sense the Mississippi River not far off . Dark and cold and abandoned buildings were on both sides of them . And he had shut off the ignition to the car , and Reesa was not liking this at all . She was not the sort to work in cars . Hotel rooms , homes , apartments , that was her thing . She thought about her purse and the small mace dispenser inside , hoping she was wrong . <p> " Hey , " she said , putting some harshness in her words because often that tone could put guys like this in their place . Particularly the professional ones who worried about exposure and scandal . <p> " Hey , " she said , " I do n't like this . " <p> That 's when she noticed him pulling on the black gloves . Not looking at her as he pulled them on , and then when they were pulled tight , he turned and punched her in the face . <p> The force of the blow did not knock her unconscious .
