Introduction // I was a princess in the court of the king .... Then he put me and my family in jail for 20 years . // Malika Oufkir tosses her fur coat onto the bed in her midtown Manhattan hotel room . She 's elegant , slender , and quite beautiful , but , as she says , " I am not normal . " // In truth , there is almost nothing normal about Oufkir . More than four years after she left Morocco , where she and her mother and brothers and sisters spent 20 years in prison , Oufkir still panics when she is out in the open . She craves quiet , dark rooms where she can be alone . New York frightens her . She hates crowds . She likes to eat alone , in silence . // " If I talk about it too much , think about it too much , I could become crazy or have a very violent reaction , " Oufkir says of the time she spent in Bir-Jdid prison for a crime in which everyone knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when her father , a powerful Moroccan general , led a failed coup against King Hassan II ; the monarch immediately ordered General Oufkir 's execution and banished his widow and six children , Malika , Myriam ( " Mimi " ) , Maria , Soukaina , Raouf , and three-year-old Abdellatif , into internal exile . // Shuttled from prison to prison for five years , Oufkir and her family were eventually dispatched to Bir-Jdid , a prison barrack near Casablanca . Locked in separate cells around a central corridor , unable to see one another , Oufkir and her siblings spent their youth in Bir-Jdid , plagued by insects , vermin , and brutal deprivation . // " Hassan enjoyed keeping us in prison , starving us , freezing us , leaving us without beds or sheets or medical care . I think he took pleasure in it every day , " Oufkir tells me , as if speaking of something that is both vaguely remote and entirely present . " He could have killed us . But he preferred to have us die slowly . " Desperately  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hassan intended for them when , using a spoon and a sardine can lid , they dug their way to freedom . // In heart-stopping and suspenseful portions of Stolen Lives , Oufkir 's remarkable memoir , she recounts the days she and three of her siblings spent racing from embassy to embassy , attempting to gain political asylum after their escape from Bir-Jdid . The outcasts , now fugitives , faced unspeakable retribution if discovered . Hollow-faced , destitute , dressed in 15-year-old rags , they hitchhiked across Morocco , seeking help from former friends who , fearing the king , again and again turned them away . After five days on the lam , they succeeded in getting a hotel guest to phone Alain de Chalvron , a French radio reporter in Paris . " An incredible scoop , " said de Chalvron , who alerted the French embassy to the Oufkirs ' plight . Once their story was out , the condemnation of the international community made it impossible for Hassan to punish the family ; Moroccan authorities nonetheless managed to keep them under house arrest for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family 's exile and escape , Oufkir led an extraordinary life . Born into an affluent and powerful family , she was chosen  --  at age five  --  by King Muhammad V to be a companion to his own small daughter , Princess Lalla Mina . The king moved Oufkir into a villa near the palace that she shared with his daughter . After three years Muhammad died , and his son Hassan II inherited the throne and guardianship of both Lalla Mina and Oufkir . Like his father , Hassan lavished attention and kindness on the girls and retained a strict German governess to ensure that they would be raised properly . Oufkir fondly recalls sitting around the piano , singing and dancing and otherwise enjoying good times with Lalla Mina and the new king . For 11 years Oufkir lived a sumptuous , if sheltered , life among Moroccan royalty , leaving the palace only occasionally for spa trips and ski vacations. // At 16 , she says , Oufkir hungered for a taste of real life and at last prevailed on the king to let her return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life as a normal person  --  and to falling in love . But she did n't get the chance . Three years later her father attempted a coup against Hassan II , the man who had raised her for eight years . It was Hassan who would banish her family to prison . // Traces of both the prisoner and the princess Oufkir has been are evident as we speak ; there is a regal quality to her great grace and poise , but there is no mistaking the haunted look in her eye . " I wrote the book in a crashing hurry , " she says softly of Stolen Lives . " My friends could not understand why . I told them , ? If this is published after Hassan dies , it would be terrible . Through his sister he invited me back to the palace . But I refused . He did not want me to talk , to write . With this book I defied him . " Hassan II died five months after Oufkir 's gripping , remorseless memoir was published ( under the title @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly became a best-seller . // Today , Oufkir lives in Paris with her husband , a French architect raised in Lebanon who is fluent in Arabic and whom she met at a Moroccan wedding eight years after her escape from Bir-Jdid . Unable to bear children because of an infection she suffered while in prison , she acts as head of her extended family ; Abdellatif , the brother who was incarcerated as a toddler and is now deeply wounded by his stunted , aberrant childhood , lives with her , as does her sister Myriam. // At 47 , Oufkir has found the freedom  --  and love  --  she craved so desperately for so long . But it has not brought comfort . " I do n't know what it means to be free , " she says . " It is easier to be a prisoner . " There is no self-pity as she explains how difficult it is for her to live in Paris . " Every day I suffer . I 'm surviving , not living . I want to be like everyone else . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades of prison between me and the world . " She draws her hunter-green suede jacket close around her slender frame . // " Anyway , I do not really want happiness , because that would deny my experience . I am like a person who has lost a limb and tries to act normal . They ca n't . Neither can I. I have arms and legs , but inside something has changed . " The strength and resolve that enabled Oufkir to survive are visible on her face , as is the fragility that is the legacy of her ordeal . " Prison stole the best things from me . Yet my experience is so rich . Prison was a detour , the way in which I managed to avoid mediocrity . Without it I would be a normal woman , with money and power . But inside ? Nothing . " // In the following exclusive excerpt from Stolen Lives Oufkir chronicles her life in a Moroccan prison and describes the family 's death-defying escape .  --  Amy Wilentz // the great escape // It was around four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at my family 's house in Casablanca with some friends , talking and laughing in the living room . Prompted by an intuition I ca n't explain , I switched on the television . A newscaster was announcing that there had been a coup d ' ? tat and that the king 's plane had been fired on . It was unclear who was responsible . // I rushed over to the radio , frantic for more news yet dreading what I might hear : that it was my father who was behind the coup . He was a powerful general in the Moroccan army and had been at increasing odds with the king , Hassan II . But information on the radio was hazy too . No one seemed to know anything for certain . There was only speculation that my father , General Oufkir , was involved and that the coup had succeeded . Order had not yet been restored in the capital . // One of my friends , though , was convinced my father was involved . She got up and pointed at me , hysterically babbling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be killed and so would they . She urged everyone to leave at once . I sat , terrified , not knowing what to do . I tried calling my mother and brothers and sisters at our house in Rabat ; the lines were busy or there was no answer . // Around seven o'clock the phone rang . It was my father . He spoke with the voice of a man who has decided to commit suicide and is recording his last message . It was as if a ghost was talking to me . He told me he loved me and that he was proud of me . Then he added , " I ask you to remain calm , whatever happens . Do n't leave the house until the escort comes to get you . " // I began to scream . He kept saying things I did n't want to hear . I wanted him to reassure me , to tell me it had n't been him . But from the start of our conversation I understood it was . And that he had failed . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my father 's last words  --  his warning not to leave . Something terrible had happened . Around 5 a.m. the next day the phone rang again . It was my mother . Without hesitating she confirmed what I was most afraid to hear : " Your father is dead . Pack your things and come back to Rabat . " // Four months later , once the official mourning period for my father had ended , the head of police arrived at our house and told my mother to get the family packed . We left on Christmas Eve  --  my mother , her six children , and Achoura and Halima , two loyal members of the household staff . Mother had just turned 36 . I was 19 , my sister Mimi was 17 , my brother Raouf 14 , and the girls , Maria and Soukaina , were just 10 and nine . My baby brother Abdellatif was three and a half . // We were told we would be going away for two weeks . We would never really return . // Our first jail was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  part of an army barracks in Assa , a town near the Algerian border . I found everything there repulsive , from the coarse military blankets to the thin foam mattresses to the lack of proper toilets . All nine of us shared the small house together and were under constant surveillance . But by and large the guards showed us sympathy . We could listen to the radio and were given plenty of bread , goat meat , and honey to eat . We were also allowed to go into the nearby town with a police escort for two hours every day . I refused to go  --  I did not want to be dependent on our captors ' goodwill  --  but the visits were very important for the children . The escorts always treated them very well , and the villagers would send them back with cakes and treats . // Fundamentally this was not much of a change from our past life . As far back as I could remember , I had never lived without several armed police responsible for my safety . The only difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch . My life was a fairy tale in reverse . I had been brought up as a princess and was now turning into Cinderella . Gradually I was shedding my old habits . We had brought around 20 designer suitcases with us  --  Vuitton , Herm ? s , and Gucci  --  filled with Paris couture and children 's clothes from Geneva , but the idea of wearing any of it soon became ludicrous . After a few months we always wore the same old clothes . // After about a year we were told that we 'd be leaving . There was no explanation , but on thinking about it a little later I concluded that the villagers must have been growing too sympathetic toward us and word of this had gotten back to the king . // We were taken to an abandoned military fort in Tamattaght , a town even more remote than Assa . There conditions were dramatically worse . The nine of us were given two rooms inside an old and crumbling fort . There was a hole that served as a toilet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A small but mostly enclosed outdoor space provided us with our only fresh air . This would be our home for almost four years . // As at Assa , we were generally well treated . Of the 25 policemen under orders to guard us day and night , around three-quarters had previously done security duty at our house in Rabat . They had known my father , directly or indirectly . They respected my mother and loved us children in a paternal way . When they could , they would bring us contraband food as well as occasional books and letters . But they could never let us out , which meant that while we were there , enclosed in the fort 's towering walls , we almost never saw anything but the smallest patch of sky . // And so we learned to live together . In wretched , cramped , filthy conditions  --  in darkness , isolation , and confinement . We tried to impose a structure on our days . We would al-ways eat three meals a day together , and sit down for tea . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up " classes " in which to teach them French and math . // It was difficult for all of us , increasingly so . Raouf was not yet over the loss of his father , at an age when a boy probably needs his father most . Soukaina was entering a moody adolescence . Maria was extremely fragile  --  when something upset her she often would not eat , speak , or move for hours . As for Mimi , she was in the most difficult straits of all . She had epilepsy , and though the guards were able to sneak drugs to her , the stress of prison caused her fits to increase anyway . Abdellatif adapted to it most readily . // At night I 'd hear my mother sobbing . Alone in her bed , she wept over the loss of her husband . As for me , especially during those early years in prison , I dreamed only of the king , Hassan II . I relived my life at the palace : my pranks , our laughter , my t ? te- ? -t @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never revisited happy family scenes , or painful ones  --  my father 's death or the mourning that followed it . There was no resentment in my dreams , no confrontation or rebellion . I had nothing but happy memories of my childhood , even though in a sense it had been stolen from me . I would wake up overcome with shame and guilt . My feelings toward the king were complicated : My own father had tried to kill my adoptive father and as a result he was dead . Sometimes I did n't know which father I missed most , which one to grieve for . I was the product of my palace upbringing ; everything I was , I owed to the man who had raised me and who was now keeping me imprisoned . At the same time I loved my real father so much . // But if I still respected Hassan II as my adoptive father , I hated the despot he had become the day he began to persecute us . I hated him for his hatred , I hated him for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mutilated childhood of my brothers and sisters . I hated him for the irreparable crime he had committed in locking up a woman and six children for such a long time and in such inhuman conditions . // We continually implored Hassan to release us . Every year on his birthday we wrote letters . We even wrote him a petition for a pardon , signed in our blood . // Then one day , after almost four years in Tamattaght , we were told to pack . The children were glad . The rest of us were torn between hope and dread . // Our next journey lasted 24 hours . The nine of us were divided into three armored trucks with blacked-out windows . We were under constant surveillance and could not even find a discreet spot when we got out to relieve ourselves ; the police came with us and watched until we had finished . It was February . As we drove , I noticed the air beginning to smell damp and the sound of frogs croaking so I concluded that we had left the desert and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not mistaken . The Bir-Jdid barracks , where we were being taken , were 27 miles from Casablanca . This we discovered much later . // Finally the trucks slowed to a halt . We were blindfolded and led through one door and then through another . The blindfolds were removed , and we found ourselves in the small courtyard of what seemed to be a former farmhouse  --  now converted to a prison . The walls of the enclosure were so high that we could n't see the sky . Soldiers stood at arms in each corner . // Four doors opened onto the courtyard . The rooms behind them , we were told , would be our cells . The first , which Mother was to share with Abdellatif , was at right angles to the other three . The second I would share with my sisters . Achoura and Halima would share the third , and Raouf would be alone in the cell on the end . Each of the cells included several little rooms . Ours included a main room with a toilet , one larger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end up storing the suitcases we were still lugging around . // The appearance of these new quarters did not bode well for our future comfort . Even though we were already accustomed to discomfort , filth , and minimal amenities , these cells were squalid . Rivulets of moisture ran from the ceiling down to the stone floor . The only light would be dim , coming from a generator that operated a few hours each night . The mattresses were just thin layers of foam with covers of dubious cleanliness set on rusty metal bed frames . // Right away we were told that we would be separated at night . We would be allowed to see each other during the day and to eat together , but at night each person would have to go back to his or her own cell . This news made us all sob . Mother cried and pleaded , saying they did n't have the right to separate her from her children . But we were told that these rules could not be relaxed . // Under this new regime , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we could go in and out of one another 's cells . Generally we all gathered in mine . This freedom of movement allowed us to carry on the routines we 'd grown used to  --  we would cook and eat together , and play with the children during the day . But here our lives were much more closely monitored . And unlike our former captors , those at Bir-Jdid showed us little sympathy . The commander , a man named Borro , was utterly devoid of compassion and seemed to take his orders directly from Rabat . Four other guards worked under his command  --  they would be rotated every month or so , apparently to prevent them from developing any sympathy for us . Outside our small prison , we were informed , even more guards were stationed . They would stop anyone from coming to help us. // Inside the prison walls Mother , Raouf , and I seemed to be the guards ' main concern . Mother because she was the wife of the hated general , me because they were aware of my influence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was his father 's son and it was natural that he would want to avenge him . Of us all it was Raouf who suffered the most physically , who took the most knocks . I lived with a permanent fear in the pit of my stomach : fear of being killed , beaten , or raped ; fear of constant humiliation . But we were never seriously beaten  --  only Raouf. // The first search took place at the beginning of April , two months after our arrival . The aim was to intimidate us . Borro 's men locked us up in Raouf 's cell until nightfall . Inside we could hear dull thuds , the sound of hammering . When we were finally allowed out , the damage was impressive . They had gathered our most valued belongings  --  our trinkets and books , Abdellatif 's toys , much of our clothing , Mother 's jewelry , and my photo album  --  and had lit a huge bonfire with everything that was combustible . ( We took the fact that they did not burn our luggage as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving . ) The children were all the more traumatized when Borro forcibly searched Soukaina , who was only 13 . Afterward she ran a high temperature for 10 days . // Then , on January 30 , Raouf 's 20th birthday , we were informed that he would be locked up for all but two hours a day . A few days later my sisters and I met the same fate . Next it was Mother and Abdellatif . During this phase we were allowed to go out into the courtyard for a breath of air , but only in shifts . Mother and Abdellatif went out in the morning until 10 ; then it was my turn , with my sisters . We would stand under Raouf 's window , he 'd cling to the bars , and we 'd chat . He was so desperate to express himself that he would monopolize the conversation . He would talk about our father and his longing to avenge him . And about sex . He suffered far more than we did from our forced abstinence and would tell the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for bourgeois boys in Morocco  --  that would have them howling with laughter . // After a few months , however , even these brief hours outside were forbidden . We were all locked up 24 hours a day . // I was 24 years old , and for the next nine years the only faces I saw were those of my sisters and the guards . My mother , Abdellatif , Raouf , and Halima and Achoura were mere voices through a wall . For more than five years we had managed to preserve a family life , a cocoon in which we protected each other . At Bir-Jdid , family life was out of the question . Everything was out of the question . // Once we were confined to our cells , our lives became completely regulated by the guards . They stopped by three times a day to bring us meal trays , and at midday to give us bread . For the first few months my sisters and I clung to a semblance of a timetable . In the morning we would exercise  --  I concocted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed a bag of rags around as a makeshift volleyball . In the afternoon we told stories . Later we gave up physical activity . Our bodies no longer responded ; we just sat around . // Our biggest enemy was time . It was tangible , monstrous , threatening , and almost impossible to master . In the summer , dusk brought back memories of the sweetness of the old days , the end of a day at the beach , time for an aperitif , the laughter of friends , the smell of the sea , the tang of salt on my bronzed skin . I relived the little I had experienced . We did n't do anything . We 'd follow the progress of a cockroach from one hole in the wall to another . Doze . Empty our minds . The sky would change color and the day draw to a close . A week felt like a day , the months like weeks ; a year meant nothing . And I was wasting away . I learned to die inwardly . I often had the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , my sisters and I got along well . The lack of privacy was torture , especially for two young women and two teenage girls . Washing , going to the toilet , and moaning in pain were all public acts  --  but we quickly got used to it . Unable to divest myself of my palace upbringing , I would n't allow the slightest breach of manners . We behaved properly at the table , we chewed delicately , we said please and thank you and excuse me . We washed ourselves scrupulously every day , especially when we had our periods , despite the freezing salt water we were given in the middle of winter that turned our skin bright red and made us shriek . // And we were always hungry . Rotting vegetables , two bowlfuls of flour , a bowl of chick peas , a bowl of lentils , 12 bad eggs , a piece of spoiled meat , a few lumps of sugar , a liter of oil , and some detergent for washing  --  this was what was divided between the nine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they could with the meager supplies , and then the guards would distribute it . // We became experts in the art of salvage , scavenging for crumbs on the floor , even eating bread soaked in the urine and feces of the mice . I can still picture Mimi , sitting up in bed , picking off the little black droppings sprinkled all over the bread with the delicacy of a duchess , before raising the morsels to her lips . All our rations were fouled by rodents . Both mice and rats overran our cell . // We all could have died 20 times over , but every time we emerged unscathed . Some of our illnesses were serious : fevers , infections , diarrhea . Others were less so : sore throats and bronchitis , headaches or toothaches , hemorrhoids , rheumatism . Maria became severely undernourished . She suffered fevers and violent sweats that were so bad that she stayed in bed all the time . I had to wash and dry her four or five times a day . Mimi was the sickest of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pills , and her constant fits left her exhausted , bedridden , and severely depressed . She stayed in bed almost without moving for eight years . I had to force her to wash . // But more than anything else , the worst thing about those years was being separated from our mother , only a few feet away . We spoke to her constantly through the wall , and she was an example to all of us . She never expressed the slightest complaint , yet she must have suffered even more than we did . // Since the day I was born , my relationship with Mother had never been less than passionate and heartbreaking . We were incredibly close in age  --  she was 17 when I was born  --  and shared a striking physical resemblance . We had also each seen our chance to be fulfilled as women savagely destroyed . The thought that I might not ever have children distressed her . // In prison , however , there was a growing ambiguity in our roles . Unwittingly , and against my will , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her other daughters . I can still picture Maria and Soukaina snuggling up to me in my bed , questioning me about the meaning of life . They told me all the secrets they would never have told Mother , first of all because at that age you do n't confide in your mother , and secondly because they were separated from her by a solid wall . // I looked after them , brought them up , and tried to keep them from despair . I was their big sister , their mother , father , and confidante . I loved them more than anything else and , like Mother , I suffered a lot more for them than I did for myself . I remember instigating dancing lessons in the cell because Maria was crying over her shattered dream of being a ballet student at the Paris Opera . I remember nursing Mimi and telling stories to Abdellatif through the wall . // Yet throughout it all I always waited impatiently for nightfall , for the peace it brought me . During the day I wore a mask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the person who breathed life into the others . At night there was nothing to do but think . As soon as dusk fell I dropped my defenses . When my sisters fell asleep at last , I would often get up and just sit . // I often wondered why Hassan II had imposed this long-drawn-out death instead of killing us right away . Our disappearance would have made matters much simpler . I thought about my father , too . Each time I pictured him I imagined the moment of his execution . That terrible moment when he realized that he was going to be killed like a dog . I swung between humiliation , pain , and rage . // And each of my birthdays was like a dagger piercing my heart . At the age of 33 I became resigned . I would never experience a great love , I would never have my own family , no man would ever take me in his arms and whisper sweet nothings or words of burning passion in my ear ; I would never know the physical and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemned to wither like a wrinkled fruit . At night I dreamed I was making love , but I learned not to think about it . I could not burden myself with these little troubles when I had so many others . I tried to remain in control of my body , to suppress everything to do with desire , hunger , cold , and thirst . // Despite her courage and dignity , Mother was still very naive . She firmly believed that we would be pardoned on March 3 , 1986 , for Throne Day , the anniversary of the king 's ascension to the throne . Yet the day came and nothing happened . The next morning , however , it seemed she might be right . At about 8:30 the guards unlocked all our doors and shoved us outside . // We staggered , squinting at the light . We were thrilled to see each other , but we looked like walking corpses  --  gaunt and pale , with dark rings around our eyes , bloodless lips , and bodies bloated from malnourishment . Mother did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soukaina and Maria when they were 14 and 15 years old . Now they were young women of 22 and just 24 . Raouf was a man , resembling my father in build . Abdellatif was a youth of 17 . Mother was as beautiful as ever , but the hardship and grief had taken a terrible toll . Achoura and Halima had gray faces and hair , the color of ash . // We were overjoyed , yet we found ourselves torn between the natural urge to touch each other and kiss and the determination not to show our tormentors how cruelly we had missed this contact . So we restrained ourselves . Astonished , Borro encouraged us to approach one another , then told us that , in celebration of Throne Day , from then on we would be allowed to be together from 8:30 in the morning until 8 at night . We were being granted this concession after 14 years in prison . // At first the elation of being reunited eclipsed the grimness of our situation . Mother gazed at us for hours . She never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been torture for her to see us so emaciated , so starved . Nevertheless we had decided to relish every joyous moment of being together again . To entertain ourselves we organized circus shows . Raouf would crack a pretend whip , and Mimi , the elephant , would make her entrance . She was painfully thin . When Raouf cracked his whip a second time , Mimi had to raise her legs in the air . We shrieked with laughter . We never tired of joking , touching each other , and embracing . // These relatively happy times lasted until the early signs of winter . Then one day , without any explanation , the guards split us up again . The next morning they told Mother that we would be locked up 24 hours a day as before . // She immediately went on a hunger strike in protest . The others , except for me , followed suit . My body can not tolerate fasting , so I merely ate as little as possible . For 45 days we starved ourselves . Soukaina even tried going without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were nothing but skin and bone and yet nothing happened . Nobody cared . // Then , sometime during the sixth week of fasting , Raouf overheard two guards talking outside his cell . " This situation has ruined my life , " one said . " I 'm ashamed to look my family in the eyes . I am haunted by what we are doing . Murdering children is beyond me . I ca n't carry on . What do they want ? " // " Do n't you understand ? " replied the other guard . " They are going to die . All of them . And they will be buried here . We 'll just wait as long as we have to . Those are our orders . " // Raouf reported this conversation to us through the walls . Everyone was terribly feeble . We all longed for death . Yet the words hit us like an electric shock . At some level we had believed our release was coming , that the king could not punish us forever . Now we knew we were simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live became overpowering . We resolved to escape . // The first task was to decide where to dig . After endless discussion we decided to start from the cell I shared with my sisters . One of the rooms was too cold to live or sleep in , so we had ended up using it as a place to put all our old suitcases . The advantages to this site were that it was unused during the day and that the floor 's stone slabs were in good condition . This would make them much easier to maneuver . We would obviously have to work at night , preferably during the hours when the generator was running in order not to be heard . // On January 27,1987  --  directly after one of our triweekly searches  --  Maria , Soukaina , and I pried up the first stone slab with a spoon , a knife handle , the lid of a sardine tin , and an iron bar from one of our beds . In two hours we had pried up eight more . // For the next two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slabs so that any sign they had been touched would be undetectable . Meanwhile , Mother , Abdellatif , Raouf , Halima , and Achoura worked on creating passages between all the cells . This was probably the most dangerous part of the plan , but it was crucial for two reasons . First , to escape , the others would all have to get from their cells to ours . Second , as we were soon to learn , we would need their help as we dug . We found that by removing stones from the walls under our beds we were able to create spaces large enough to squeeze through . We were always scrupulous about closing the holes up each morning . // Finally my sisters and I started digging in earnest . Raouf had studied some engineering in grade school and explained to me the various levels of soil I would find . When I reached clay I was to start digging horizontally . Then , we estimated , it would take 16 feet to clear the outside edge of the cell 's wall . We worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty one-gallon oil can with earth , which my sisters would then haul up from above . Mimi would add water to the dirt , making it more dense , and she would hand it through the wall to my mother . Mother would sew balls of the dirt up in old , unused clothes and send them back through the wall . We would store these bundles in our tunnel to keep it from sounding hollow during searches . // Demolishing and digging was easy . The hard part was reconstruction , which could take hours . First we returned the bagged dirt to the hole . Then we spread a layer of red dirt on top and replaced the stone slabs . To finish off , we filled the cracks with a fake plaster made of detergent and flour we had saved from our rations . Once everything had dried I would sweep it up . // We had some terrible scares . During the searches we would stay in our beds without budging , pretending to be ill . The guards carried out a painstaking inspection , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They shone their torches into corners , looking everywhere  --  under the beds , at the ceiling , in the cavities . They tapped the floor with their feet , listening for a different sound , the faintest echo . It is a miracle , but they never set foot on the slabs we were digging under . // By April 18 I had tunneled down and out the agreed distance , and I stopped digging . I had no nails left , my skin was covered with eczema , and my fingers were bleeding sores . We had all agreed that the escape should be in December , on a moonless winter night when the guards  --  who were sensitive to the cold , like all Moroccans  --  would be ensconced in the snuggest corner of their watchtowers , their faces muffled by warm hoods . So we sealed the tunnel one last time . Two weeks before the escape we would finish digging up the few feet to the surface . Before that it would be too risky . // During the days when we were digging we held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what to do once outside . Raouf wanted to go alone  --  he was so afraid for us all  --  but it was obvious that I would go with him . Maria had declared outright that if we did n't take her she would kill herself . We would also take Abdellatif , who had seen nothing of life , who had no past bearings  --  he needed to be part of this adventure . Mother wanted to come , but she was physically unable to do so . Her body was bloated , like the rest of ours , and she could n't even squeeze through the hole between our cell and hers . Only Abdellatif could wriggle through . We could n't enlarge it for fear of breaking the tiles supporting the wall . Soukaina too agreed to stay behind  --  a demonstration of her courage and generosity , as we needed her to seal up the tunnel after we left . Mimi was simply too weak to do it . For the same reason it was impossible for her to leave . // Once we got out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to request political asylum . We tried to anticipate every possible setback . On the morning of our escape Mother was to waylay the guards as long as possible , to stop them from raising the alarm immediately . In case we were captured , she planned to cause an explosion with the little butane stove Achoura and Halima had in their cell for cooking . We even started saving pepper to fend off any stray dogs . // On Sunday , April 19 , 1987 , the day after we closed the tunnel , I was sitting on the floor of the cell , my head leaning against a wall . We could hear birds chirping outside the walls . Nature , like us , was awakening from a long sleep . We felt strangely well , despite the prospect of several months ' wait . We had emerged from the tomb . At last we had reason to hope . // Mimi lay in bed , the other two were cuddling up to me , and we were chatting lightheartedly . Then I heard my mother calling to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I overheard them . They have been given orders to build a lookout post and a watchtower on the roof of the tunnel cell . The lookout post will be exactly in line with the exit , and there 'll be floodlights. " // " What will we do ? " // " There is no choice , " she said . " They will have finished in 48 hours . You must dig the escape shaft straightaway and leave tonight . " // I had any number of objections . Dig out in a few hours ? It was n't possible . We expected it to take a week . // But she would n't listen . " It 's that or nothing , " she repeated . " If you do n't leave tonight , you will never get out . Tell Raouf. " // Raouf agreed with my mother  --  we had no choice . // I started digging around midday , working furiously . The spoon was n't enough . If I could have ripped out the earth with my teeth I would have . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer thought , I no longer existed , I had become a machine . Digging , scooping , digging , scooping ... // At one point I came across some deeply rooted ivy . I pulled with all my strength . For hours I battled , digging upward against those roots , straining to pull them out . // And suddenly my field of vision turned blue . I had broken through . // It was the late afternoon sky , swept by a warm spring breeze that gently caressed my cheek . I stood stock-still for a while , just clutching the ivy and looking out with one eye . Weeping , I poked my head through . It was too beautiful . I was afraid of what I could see . Freedom was so close that it frightened me . I rushed back up to tell the others . We were almost there . // At nightfall it was time to say goodbye . Mother was distraught , wondering whether she really ought to let us go . It was the only time I saw her waver . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said to me . " I know that you are also their mother . Promise me you 'll bring them back alive . " Soukaina shivered . Her teeth were chattering and her eyes were shining , but she did n't shed a tear . She carried an enormous responsibility . She had to cover all our tracks to delay the guards ' discovery of our escape for as long as possible . Mimi tenderly clasped me to her and whispered in my ear , " I 'm sure you 'll make it . " // We dressed in silence , picked up our bundles , and one by one lowered ourselves down into the tunnel . Abdellatif and Maria got through the exit without any difficulty . Raouf made the earth shudder . We held our breath , but he managed to push through and free himself without any damage . When it was my turn I managed to get my upper body through the exit hole , but my hips became wedged . I could n't go any further . I was stuck . My bloated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Raouf encouraged me , whispering gently to calm me down , but I could n't . I was unable to budge . I strained , I cried , I was drenched in perspiration . Then I heard Soukaina behind me . " Malika , come back , " she said . " You 're making too much noise , they 'll hear you . " // If I persisted I might get us all caught . But once again I summoned all my strength . It was like a second birth . At last I pulled myself from the tunnel . I 'd scraped off all the skin on my thighs , but at the time I did n't even notice . // We had been living in the shadows for so long that our eyes had grown accustomed to the dark , and we gazed out at our surroundings without any sense of fear . On the contrary , we were exhilarated . There was no sign of life from the guards ' quarters , and we began to crawl across a damp field . // Suddenly we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , making straight for us  --  aggressive , starving , and more ferocious than watchdogs . There must have been about 10 of them , bounding through the dark behind the leader of the pack . They were getting closer and closer . We could feel their panting breath . Once again we huddled together for protection . Their leader came forward baring his fangs , growled , and looked poised to attack . We froze and held our breath , waiting for a miracle . Which , improbable as it seemed , is what we were granted . The dog gave an unfathomable whine , and he and his pack slunk away . // But the reprieve did not last long . Alerted by the dogs , the guards turned their torches and floodlights onto the field . We froze again , praying that we would melt into the shadows . Certain of discovery this time , we waited there shivering for their shots to ring out . We could hear the guards exchange a few words . At last the lights went off . We crouched there , unable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set off again . // We found ourselves in a field of beans , closer to the barracks side . We needed a short rest , so we rolled over onto our backs and looked at the camp facing us for the first time . It was a grim sight . So this was the place where we had spent 10 years of our lives , where we had lost our best years , our hopes , our illusions , our health , and our youth . I looked over at Abdellatif . For the first time in ages I realized just what a terrible state he was in . He had been incarcerated since the age of three and a half . Now he was 18 , and it was as though he had never been outside in his life . My sister Maria weighed barely 66 pounds . Her huge dark eyes devoured her tiny , gaunt face . Raouf was as thin as she was but bloated from water retention . He was pale and toothless. // Nearly 15 years had gone by , 15 years of torture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three of them closely I would catch an expression , mannerism , or smile that reminded me of the children they had once been . // Locked up inside , we had tried to forget where we were . But now , in that field , contemplating the place where we had suffered so much , the reality suddenly came home to us . I could n't stop myself from sobbing . I wept even more when I thought of those we had left behind . I was so afraid for them . My heart contracted and a shudder ran through me . I heard the others crying softly ; they all felt the same way . // After a while we got up and resumed walking . In the pitch dark , with no landmarks and no signposts , we realized that we were going around in circles . It was as distressing as being lost at sea or in the desert . There was nothing to give us any clue where the road was , and none of us had a good sense of direction . Mother had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been a very bad student . Despairing , I asked Abdellatif to guide us . " We are adults , " I said to him . " We may have committed sins , but not you . You are so pure .... If there is a God , he 'll take pity on you . You will lead us to freedom . " We followed him without a word . Our bodies were aching and our clothes were soaked through , but we had to keep going . // " Malika , " Abdellatif called finally . " Come and see . There 's something hard . I do n't know what it is. " // I ran up to him . My younger brother did n't know what asphalt was . The others joined us , rolling and kissing the pavement . We were like astronauts , venturing their first steps on the moon . // The Oufkirs were captured five days later . The entire family was then reunited and for the next three and a half years lived under house arrest outside Marrakech . In 1991 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ issued them passports and visas . The family now lives in Paris . // According to Amnesty International hundreds of political prisoners are still incarcerated throughout Morocco ; the Moroccan government admits that 56 political prisoners died in Moroccan jails between 1960 and 1980. //
