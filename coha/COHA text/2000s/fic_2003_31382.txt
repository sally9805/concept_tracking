The siren 's squeal split the morning , the flashing blue-then-red-then-blue dashboard light reflecting off other cars as the black Chevy Tahoe weaved its way through rush-hour traffic on US 95 . The sun was rising orange and bright , tinting the clouds pink , and the air conditioning within the SUV was already grappling with the July heat . In the passenger seat sat Gil Grissom , graveyard-shift supervisor of the Las Vegas Criminalistics Bureau . In the driver 's seat was Warrick Brown  --  rank CSI3 , just one notch under Grissom  --  and in back was another member of their team , Sara Sidle , rank CSI2 . Warrick sawed the steering wheel right and left as he dodged between cars , his expression impassive . He might have been watching paint dry . Grissom 's boyishly handsome features were slightly compromised by the gray encroaching on his brown hair , and crow 's feet were sneaking up on the edges of his eyes , frown lines etching inroads at the corners of his mouth . The politics of this job had taken their toll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the science of investigation , the constant jousting with day-shift supervisor Conrad Ecklie , the strain on his budget , and the pressures of management had started to age the perennially youthful Grissom . This reality was aided and abetted by the fact that , even though he had never needed much sleep , now he hardly got any at all . The SUV hurtled toward a small Honda . Warrick slashed to the right , barely missed a FedEx truck , then bounced back left , coming within inches of a blue Lincoln stretch limo . From the back , Sara yelled , " Geez , Warrick , he 's not gon na get moredead . Slow down . " Warrick ignored her remark and jumped into the diamond lane to pass a cab , then hopped back into his own lane . " Why did n't you let me drive ? " Sara asked her boss as she bounced around , her seat belt straining . " Grissom , will you say something to him ? " Ignoring the exchange , Grissom turned his gaze toward the reddish sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grissom said , " Red sky at night , sailor 's delight  --  red sky at morning , sailor take warning . " Sara leaned forward . " What was that , Grissom ? " He shook his head as he studied the clouds . " Nothing . " " Please tell me that was n't an aphorism , " she said . " Please tell me you 're not spouting quotes while this maniac is  --  " " Sailors ? " Warrick asked . " Gris , we 're in the desert . " " Shut up , " Sara snapped , " and keep your eyes on the road . " Warrick shot her a glance in the rearview mirror , twitched a half-smirk , and crossed all three lanes of traffic , jerking the wheel to the right as they turned onto Decatur Boulevard . Seconds later the SUV squealed to a halt in front of the Beachcomber Hotel and Casino . " Six minutes , twenty-seven seconds , " Warrick said as he threw open his door , bestowing on his boss a tiny self-satisfied smile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the limber driver turned to jump out of the truck , Grissom gripped Warrick 's shoulder , startling him a little . Grissom kept his voice quiet , even friendly , but firm . " From now on , unless I say otherwise , you obey the speed limit  --  okay , Mario ? " Warrick gave him a sheepish smile . " Yeah , Gris  --  sorry . " In the backseat , Sara shook her head in disgust , her ID necklace swinging as she muttered a string of curses . As she climbed out , dragging a small black suitcase of equipment with her , she said , " Gon na get us all killed , then who 's going to investigate our scene ? I mean , we 'll all be dead . " Grissom turned and looked over his sunglasses at her , through the open back door . She got the message and piped down . Warrick grabbed his own black suitcase from the back of the vehicle and fell in next to Sara . Climbing down , Grissom  --  carrying his silver flight-case-style field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sidewalk was nearly empty in front of the hotel , the doormen outnumbering the guests . The little group was almost to the front door when Captain Jim Brass materialized to fall in step with Grissom . Brass said , " The hotel manager wants to know how soon we 're going to be out of there . " " Why ? " Brass blinked his sad eyes . " Why ? So he can let the guests move in and out of their rooms on that floor . " Shaking his head , Grissom asked , " What 'd you tell him ? " Brass shrugged . " As soon as we possibly can . " A rotund doorman stepped forward and opened the big glass front door for them . Sunglasses came off as they moved through the gaudy lobby  --  Grissom tuning out the sounds of spinning slots , rolling roulette balls , dealers calling cards , the typical dinging and ringing casino cacophony  --  and Brass led them to the right , toward a gleaming bank of elevators . " Where 's the vic ? " Warrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right there in the hall , outside his hotel room door , shot twice in the head , small caliber , a .22 or a .25 maybe . Looks like a mob hit , might be a robbery got outa hand . " " We 'll see , " Grissom said , never interested in theories so early . " Is there videotape ? " Most of the resort hotels on the Strip had video cameras in every hall , but not all the ones off the Strip , like the Beachcomber , had caught up . Brass nodded . " It 's set up in the main security room  --  waiting for you , whenever you 're ready . " When they were safely alone in the elevator , away from guests and staff , Grissom turned to Brass . " You tell the manager we 'll be done when we 're done . I do n't care if he has to use a cherry picker to get these people out of their rooms , they 're not going to disturb my crime scene . The hotel gets it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brass held up his hands in surrender . " Okay , okay , I 'll tell him . I just wanted to save the guy for you to alienate . " Taking a deep breath , Grissom let his head drop a little as he exhaled . " Tell him we 'll work as fast as we can , but this is not fast work . " The elevator dinged , the door slid open , and it began . Stepping out , Grissom looked to his left where Detective Erin Conroy , stood interviewing a twenty-something young man who wore a white shirt , black bow tie and black slacks  --  a waiter . The CSI group paused to snap on their latex gloves . " Guy 's a spitting image for David Copperfield , " Warrick said softly , behind Grissom . " The waiter , " Sara said , amused . " Yeah  --  spot on . " Grissom turned to them . " Who ? " Sara 's eyebrows climbed . " Grissom  --  you live in Vegas and you do n't know who David Copperfield is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is this pertinent ? " Sara and Warrick , silenced , exchanged glances . Moving forward , Brass on his left , Warrick and Sara behind him , Grissom stopped in front of a uniformed officer on watch at the near end of the crime scene . Beyond the officer , Grissom saw the body slumped in a doorway alcove ; a large , circular , silver tray lay on the carpet across the hall ; and spaghetti , meat sauce , and the components of a tossed green salad lay scattered everywhere . A white carnation , spilled out of its vase , lay at the corpse 's feet like an impromptu funeral offering . " Anyone been through here since you arrived ? " Grissom asked . Garcia shook his head . He pointed to a rangy officer at the other end of the hall . " My partner , Patterson , had the manager let him up the fire stairs down there . " " Good work . " " Thank you , sir . " Turning to Brass , Grissom asked , " Any idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Smith . ' " Grissom raised an eyebrow . Brass shrugged elaborately . " That 's how he registered . Paid for everything in cash too . " " Right . You check for a wallet ? " Brass shook his head . " Waiting for you to clear the scene . I used to have your job , remember ? " Brass had indeed been the CSI supervisor until not so long ago ; he 'd been something of a prick , in fact , but had mellowed since returning to Homicide . Grissom asked , " Your people canvassing the guests ? " " They 're on it now  --  they started at either end , so they do n't disturb the scene . " " Good call . And ? " " Nobody saw anything , nobody heard anything . " Stepping in carefully , Grissom bent over the body . Lying on his stomach , head just slightly to one side , his brown eyes open , glazed , staring at nothing , John Smith looked surprised more than anything else . Cautiously , Grissom changed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tap , small caliber ; Brass was probably right  --  a .25 . The odd thing was the placement . Two small holes formed a colon in the center back of John Smith 's skull , and  --  if Grissom did n't miss his bet  --  almost exactly one inch between them . Grissom felt gingerly for a wallet , found nothing , gave up and rose ; then he turned to his CSIs . " Footprints first , you know the drill . If this guy was n't Peter Pan , he left his mark . " Warrick nodded , alertness in the seemingly sleepy eyes . " All comes down to shoe prints . " " Yep , " Sara said . Grissom stepped aside so Warrick and Sara and their field kits could pass . " Sara , you do the fingerprints . Warrick the photos . " " Good thing I skipped breakfast , " Sara said . " Least there 's no bugs yet , " Warrick said to her . Bugs and larva were about the only thing that threw the strong-spined Sidle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This hotel might not like it , but our little friends are here . " Sara and Warrick began by scouring the entire crime scene for footprints . This would take a while , so Grissom followed Brass over to where policewoman Conroy stood with the waiter . Flicking the badge on his breast pocket , Brass said to the waiter , " I 'm Captain Brass and this is CSI Supervisor Grissom . " The skinny dark-haired waiter nodded to them . Conroy , her voice flat , said , " This is Robert LaFay .... " " Bobby , " the man interjected . She went on as if he had n't spoken . " ... a room-service waiter . He was taking an order to room ... " She checked her notes . " ... four-twenty , but he never made it . Ran into the killer . " Turning sharply to the waiter , Grissom asked , " Mr. LaFay ... Bobby  --  you saw the killer ? " LaFay shrugged his narrow shoulders . " Sort of ... not really . He was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the guy was already down and he shot him again , right in the back of the head ! Then he heard me and turned around , and blocked his face with his arm  --  you know , like Dracula with his cape ? " " Bobby , did you get any kind of look at his face ? " " No . Not really . " " Was he a big man , small man , average ? " " Mostly what I saw was the gun . It seemed so big and it was the second gun I 'd seen tonight . " Grissom and Brass exchanged glances , and the former said , " Second gun ? " The waiter nodded . " Up in eight-thirteen . Big guy , had a cannon on his nightstand . He said he was FBI , but ... " " FBI ? " Brass said , incredulously . " You did n't believe him ? " Grissom asked . " Nope . " Grissom gave Brass another quick look , then returned his attention to LaFay . " So , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes widened . " Then I took the hell off toward the elevator and I guess he went the other way . " " Down the hall ? " " Yeah . Anyway , he did n't shoot at me that I know of . " Brass said , " Bobby , would n't you know if you were shot at ? " " I 'm not sure . That gun was n't very loud . " Eyebrows up , Brass asked , " No ? " " No . Loud enough to scare the crap outa me , though . " Brass grunted a laugh , but Grissom was thinking he 'd have to tell Warrick to dust that stairwell . " Can you tell us anything about the killer ? " " I did n't see him good at all . " " Think , Bobby . Close your eyes and visualize . " LaFay did as he was told , his brow furrowing . " White guy . " " Good . What else do you see , Bobby ? " " Older guy . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Feeling suddenly ancient , Grissom nodded his encouragement . " Anything else ? Scars ? Tattoos ? " The waiter shook his head . " Nope . " " What was he wearing ? Shut your eyes , Bobby . Visualize . " " ... Jacket  --  a suit coat . " His eyes popped open and he grinned . " I remember that ! ' cause afterward , when I had time to think about it , I wondered why anybody would wear a suit coat in Vegas in July . " " Good , good  --  anything else ? " " Nope . Mr. Grissom , I can close my eyes till tomorrow this time , and I wo n't see anything else . " Grissom granted the waiter a smile , touched his arm encouragingly . " Mr. LaFay , do you think you could identify the killer ? " The waiter thought for a moment , looked at Grissom and shook his head slowly . " No .... That good I ca n't visualize . " Grissom and Brass thanked him , then rejoined Warrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor as , nearby , Sara carefully bagged a piece of tomato . " Got anything ? " Grissom asked . " I 've got a footprint in the blood , " Warrick said , " but it 's smeared , like the guy slipped trying to take off . " Carefully stepping around Sara , Grissom moved in next to Warrick and followed Warrick 's gaze . Warrick was right : the footprint was useless . Turning on his haunches and lowering his head , Grissom carefully studied the hallway . " Look , " he said pointing another three feet down the hall , behind Warrick . " Another one . " Warrick got to it , checked it , then turned back to Grissom . " Smeared too . " His head still bent down near the floor , Grissom said , " Go another yard . " " I do n't see anything . " " Ever use Leuco Crystal Violet ? " Warrick shrugged . " Yeah , sure , but it 's been a while . " Grissom grinned . " Now 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up as Warrick withdrew a spray bottle from his black field-kit bag . " What 's that ? " " See the spot on the carpeting ? " Grissom asked . The detective shrugged . " All I see is a dirty carpet . " " There 's a bloody footprint there . " " Really . " " Yes  --  we just ca n't see it . " Brass frowned . " A bloody footprint we ca n't see ? " " The red cells have all been rubbed off the shoe , but the hemoglobin and white cells remain . " Warrick carefully sprayed an area of the rug and picked up the lecture . " This is Leuco Crystal Violet  --  a powder . But here today on the Home Shopping Network , we 've added it to a solution of sulfosalicylic acid , sodium acetate , and hydrogen peroxide . " With a small chuckle , Brass asked , " If it 's going to explode , you mind giving me a heads up ? " As the solution began to work , Grissom jumped back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bring out the footprint in that dirty carpet . " " No way . " " Way , " Grissom said as the spot on the floor turned purple , showing the outline of a running shoe . " About a size eleven , I 'd say , " Warrick said . " Now we photograph it . " Brass asked , " Can you match that to anything ? " Grissom nodded . " Once we get it back to the lab , we 'll tell you exactly what kind of shoe that print belongs to . After the database tells us , that is . Then , when we get a suspect , we 'll be able to compare this to a shoe of his and give you an exact match . " " Hey , Grissom , " Sara called . " All I 'm finding is pasta and a salad . And let me tell you , the buffet at Caesar 's is better . " " Keep digging , anyway . And , Warrick ? " Warrick 's head bobbed up . " Yeah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's the way Elvis left the building . " Warrick nodded . " So  --  mob hit ? " Brass asked . Grissom led Brass back up the hall toward the elevators . " Too soon to tell . " " Robbery gone wrong ? " Grissom ignored the question . " Let 's go see the videotape . " " Go ahead , " Brass said . " I 'll join you after I head upstairs and talk to that guy first . " Grissom 's eyes tightened . " Our FBI man with the cannon ? " " Precisely . " " The tape can wait . I 'll come with you . " " Fine . You interface so well with the FBI , after all . " Upstairs , Brass led the way out of the elevator . Grissom slid in next to him as they moved down the hall toward room 813 . Pulling his service revolver from its holster , Brass signaled for Grissom to hang back out of the alcove . Frowning , Grissom stopped short of the doorway as Brass moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left hand . " Just a sec , " said a muffled voice beyond the door . His feet set , Brass leveled his .38 at the door , which thankfully had no peephole . Peeking around the corner , Grissom watched as the door cracked slowly open . He saw the big man in boxer shorts  --  and the monstrous automatic in his beefy hand . And Grissom said , " Gun ! " Brass ducked out of the alcove , plastered himself to the wall , away from the door , and yelled , " Police ! Put that gun down , and open the door , and put your hands up  --  high ! " Silence . " Do it now ! " Brass said . The door opened and the big man  --  hands way up  --  stepped back . His expression was one of alarm , and he was nodding toward the nearby bed , on which the pistol had been tossed . " I 'm unarmed ! " he said . " Unarmed ... " Brass forced the big man up against a wall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was told and Grissom eased into the room behind the pair as Brass frisked the man . " Why the gun , sir ? " Grissom asked , his voice cool . Over his shoulder , the big man said , " I deliver jewelry . It 's for protection . " Brass jumped in . " Did you know a murder was committed downstairs this morning ? " The man looked thunderstruck . " No ! Hell no ! You do n't ... you do n't think I did it ? " Grissom moved forward . " Let 's slow down for a moment . What 's your name , sir ? " " Ron Orrie . " " ID ? " Brass asked . Orrie nodded toward the nightstand . " My wallet 's right there . " " Do you have a permit for the pistol ? " " In the wallet , too . " Grissom studied the gun for a moment , a .45 . " Is this your only handgun ? " Looking nervous , Orrie nodded . " Only one I have with me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Wrong weapon . Too big . John Smith was killed with something smaller . " Brass did n't seem so eager to let Orrie off the hook . " Why did you tell the waiter you were with the FBI ? " Orrie shrugged . " I did n't want to explain my business . The more people that know what I do , the better chance I 'll get knocked over . It was my own damn fault . Normally , I would n't have left the gun laying out . But I 'd ordered breakfast from room service and he showed up before I was completely dressed and had it holstered . " The detective looked skeptical . Grissom thumbed through the wallet , finding a New Jersey driver 's license and concealed weapons permits from both Jersey and New York . " You are in fact Ronald Eugene Orrie , " Grissom said as he compared the photo on the license to the man , " and you have up-to-date concealed weapons permits . " " I know . " " With your permission , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What ... what kind of residue ? " " The kind a gun leaves when you fire it . " " I have n't fired a gun in months ! " " Good . Any objection ? " " No ... no . " " Thank you . Someone from criminalistics will come to see you , within the hour . " The man winced . " But can you make me stay in this room ? I do n't mean to be uncooperative , but ... " A frown seemed to involve Brass 's whole body , not just his mouth . His whole demeanor said , I knew it could n't be this easy , and Grissom 's eyes replied , They never are . Brass said , " Mr. Orrie , do you have a concealed weapons permit from the state of Nevada ? " Orrie shook his head . " Then you know you ca n't leave this room with that gun , correct ? " The man nodded . " If I catch you on the street with it , I 'm going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And do n't tell anyone else you 're with the FBI . " " No , sir ... I mean , yes , sir . " " And wait here until somebody from the crime lab comes to see you . " " Yes , sir . " " And if we decide to search your hotel room , will you require us to get a warrant ? " " No , sir . " " Are we done here ? " Grissom asked . Brass still seemed to want to hang on to the only suspect he had . Finally , he said , " Yeah , we 're done . " Grissom said , " Let 's go look at the tapes . "
