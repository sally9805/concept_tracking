June 14 San Jos , Costa Rica David Claridge Cole felt the jet losing altitude , but he did not stir . He sat , eyes closed , his chest rising and falling heavily from the change of pressure within the descending aircraft . The set of his strong jaw and the vertical lines between his eyes marred the normally attractive face of the **27;195;TOOLONG . He wanted to be anywhere but on a plane flying to Costa Rica in the middle of June . A slow , crooked smile replaced his frown as he recalled the prior evening 's festivities . It had been a long time , too long , since he had enjoyed a night filled with music , sumptuous food , and celebrating that lasted until pinpoints of light from the rising sun pierced the cover of the nighttime sky . He had been the best man in a wedding party , and the reveling following the ceremony had reminded him of how much he missed a life-style that had been a never-ending party . As the per-cussionist for the popular jazz band Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sessions , live performances , and promotional parties and tours . He 'd been on a dizzying merry-go-round that he never wanted to get off . But it all stopped when his older brother Martin resigned as CEO of ColeDiz International Ltd. to embark on a political career . He had been expected to take over the responsibility of the day-to-day operation of the family-owned export company.He 'd even surprised himself , once he learned all of the laws and regulations regarding export tariffs as well as environmental sanctions and controls . He 'd assumed control of ColeDiz at twenty-seven and now , at thirty-six , he wanted out . Running ColeDiz for nine years had offered him the experience he needed for a future undertaking . It was n't that he minded being a businessman . However , he did n't want to have to concern himself with the fluctuating prices of bananas or coffee . What he wanted to do was focus his energies on discovering new musical talent . The idea of setting up his own recording company had come to him more than a year ago , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cor-porate jet for a business trip . His last meeting with Interior Minister Raul Cordero-Vega had not gone well . What should have been a civil meeting ended with a hostile verbal confrontation . David had n't waited for the cor-porate jet to fly him back to Florida , but had taken a commer-cial flight instead . Vega had threatened to increase the tariffs on bananas for the second time in less than a decade , because he claimed the plastic casings used to protect the fruit during har-vesting were found in the digestive tracts of turtles washed up along the Costa Rican coastline . Environmentalists were pres-suring the government to fine or expel the foreign-owned com-panies , and Vega 's solution was to double the already enormously high tariffs . Martin Cole 's last act as CEO had been to transfer many of the ColeDiz ventures to Belize , while leaving the conglomerate 's most productive banana plantation near Puerto LimA3n . And after conferring with Martin and his father Samuel , David was given the go-ahead to negotiate the sale of their one remaining Costa Rican business enterprise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be his last trip to the Central American country . Under another set of circumstances he would have enjoyed the lush nation filled with more than fifty active volcanoes , because the region was beautiful and so were its people . They were a warm , polite , and friendly exotic mix of native Indians , Spanish , and people of African descent . Estimating it would take him less than two weeks to conclude his business dealings with Vega , he felt some of his resentment waning as the sight of the San Jos airport came into view . Pain , frustration , and fatigue were clearly etched on the face of Interior Minister Raul Cordero-Vega , aging the man . Two weeks before , anyone glancing at the tall , erect , graying man would not have taken him for sixty-two . Now he appeared to be ten years older . That morning he 'd received a telephone call telling him that his only child , a son , had been arrested and charged with drug trafficking and the murder of a United States DEA agent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel Diego Vega was locked away in a U.S. prison and denied bail because the prosecutor feared he would leave the States and not return for his trial . Not even the high-priced lawyer Raul had retained to handle his son 's case could get the judge to change his decision , though he pleaded that Gabriel would will-ingly surrender his Costa Rican passport . So much for American justice , Raul seethed silently . A surge of rage darkened his brown face at the same time his hands tight-ened into fists . While his son languished in the bowels of an American prison , other known criminals ran rampant through the streets thumbing their noses at U.S. justice . Men who were known to openly engage in illegal activities felt the warmth of the morning sun and enjoyed the smell of fresh air while Gabriel lay in a small concrete jail cell on a narrow cot inhaling the stench from his open commode . " Not my son ! " he whispered to the empty room . Not the child he 'd waited thirty-six years to father . A sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come in ! " There was no mistaking the harshness in the command . The door opened slowly and his eyes widened in surprise . She had disobeyed him . He 'd told her not to come to Costa Rica . She was to have remained in the States -- with Gabriel . She was all his son had there . Large , clear-brown eyes took in the thunderous expression on the face of the tall , white-haired man . At one time that expression would 've sent her running from his celebrated temper , but no longer . She was thirty years old , a grown woman . The tyrant she had once feared was gone forever , and in his place a broken man . Serena could see her stepfather hurting . What he was feeling at that moment , she also felt . Raul had lost a son and she her half brother . Holding out her arms , she walked slowly into his study . " Poppa . " Her normally husky voice shook with raw emotion . " I had to come . " Raul crossed the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face in her wealth of unruly curls , he held her close , I told you to stay because Gabriel needs you . " Pulling back slightly , Serena blinked back the tears flooding her large round eyes . " Gabe would n't see me . " Raul frowned . " What do you mean ? " " He refuses to see me . " His frown deepened . " Why ? " Serena shook her head , a riot of reddish-brown curls moving as if they 'd had taken on a life of their own . " I do n't know . I spoke to his attorney , and he says that Gabe does n't want to talk to anyone except those who are his legal counsel . " She sniffled , bringing a tissue to her pert nose . " I 'm his sister , and he wo n't see or talk to me . " Embracing her again , Raul brought her head to his chest . " Whatever you do , do n't breathe a word of this to your mother . " " How is she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't leave her room . " Extracting herself , Serena paced the length of the carpeting lining the expansive room . " I do n't understand any of it , Poppa . Gabe called me and said he was going down to the Keys --  " " What keys ? " Raul interrupted . Remembering that her stepfather was not an American , and that he was not familiar with the terminology , she smiled for the first time in two weeks . " The Florida Keys . He told me that he and a friend were going on a sailing expedition down to the Caribbean . They had planned to pick up a few more people in the Bahamas before returning to the States . On their return trip they were intercepted by the United States Coast Guard . What followed is a jumble of con-fusion , and U.S. officials claim that the boat they were on was filled with drugs , and that Gabe and his fellow passengers are smugglers . " " That 's a lie ! " Raul shouted . She stopped pacing . " We both know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabe knew nothing about it . He had to have been set up . " " And I know who set him up . " Serena arched a delicate eyebrow . " Who , Poppa ? " Raul gave her a long , penetrating look before his heavy eyelids lowered , concealing the hatred and distrust burning within them . " Los Estados Unidos . " Her jaw dropped as she stared back at her stepfather . " Why the United States ? " " Because I wo n't permit them to rape my country . Because I make them pay for the destruction they leave behind when they take what they want from Costa Rica . These Americans grow rich and stuff their already swollen bellies , " " Do you actually believe the United States would blackmail Gabe because of you ? " He nodded , unable to disclose the political machinations going on between Costa Rica and other foreign powers about business ventures . Foreign companies were responsible for the slow , but methodic destruction of the rain forest and its indige-nous wildlife . If left unchecked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impossible for Costa Ricans to survive in their own country . Their nation would fare no better than the people and the vanishing wildlife of the Brazilian Amazon . " I do n't believe that , " Serena countered angrily . " That 's because you are an American , Chica . I expect you to defend your country . " Swallowing , she chose her words carefully . " We 'll talk about this later . I must see my mother . " She loved her stepfather because he was the only father she 'd ever known . However , Serena could never understand his virulent dislike of Americans . She found this hard to fathom because he 'd married her mother , who had never given up her American citizenship . He inclined his near-white head . " Yes . We 'll talk later . " He waited and he was n't disappointed when she walked over to him and rose on tiptoe to kiss his cheek . Cupping the back of her head , he pressed his lips to her forehead . " Te amo , Chica . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she whispered then turned and made her way out of the room . Raul waited as the door opened and closed behind his step-daughter 's retreating figure . He was still staring at the door when it opened slightly and his driver stepped into the room . " What is it ? " he snapped . Rodrigo knew better than to enter his study without knocking . " Seor Cole has arrived in San Jos and is waiting for you . " Raul 's scowl deepened quickly . David Cole had returned to Costa Rica . The last time he and the brash young man met they 'd traded words -- words that had left a bitter taste in his mouth . Words he never would 've permitted another man to utter in his presence . Words that David Cole would find himself swallow-ing and choking on . " Tell Seor Cole that I can not leave Puerto LimA3n at this time . If he refuses to come , then bring him here -- either standing or reclining . The choice will be his . That will be all , Rodrigo . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door to close , a feral smile curling his upper lip . The United States government held his son prisoner , and now he wanted Samuel Cole to feel the same pain when he imprisoned his last born . " An eye for an eye , and a son for a son . " His threat , though spoken softly , carried throughout the space and lingered like a musical note before fading into a hushed silence .
