Chapter One Sussex , July 1813 He never would have anticipated that the means for his revenge would come through his wife . But when he saw how Justin Everard , the young Marquis of Wroth , looked at Isabelle , the sudden admiration in his eye , the way his gaze frequently fell on her during the interminable dinners , he knew he had found his tool . He would destroy Wroth , and with that destruction bring about the destruction of Wroth 's father , the Duke of Westmore . And then his own father 's death would be avenged at last . He had made his plans carefully . The two-week house party had proved perfect . He had thrown Isabelle in Wroth 's way as frequently as possible , appealing to her disgustingly sweet nature to befriend him . With satisfaction , he had watched Wroth become more enamoured with his wife each day . But , despite Wroth 's reputation , he made no move to actually seduce Isabelle , instead treating her with a protective chivalry which set his teeth on edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To his fury , he realised his wife was succumbing to Wroth 's charm . There was nothing overt in her behaviour , for after two years of marriage she was still too prudish , too rigidly moral to ever display an illicit passion . If anything , she was undoubtedly horrified at her lapse . He did not love Isabelle . He had married her because , as Baron Allingham 's only child , she had brought to the marriage a generous portion . And in two years , on her twenty-fourth birthday , she would inherit a sizeable fortune from her grandmother . He had married her as well because he desperately wanted an heir but , despite her lovely body with its supple curves and his persistent efforts , she had failed him . Her barrenness only made him despise her more . But she belonged to him and he could not let her go unpunished . So the plan he had devised would destroy not only Wroth , but humiliate and chastise Isabelle as well . The knock on the door startled Belle . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Greystone nearly a fortnight ago . The other female guests of Sir Farley Greystone were too busy with their cards and gossip and lovers to notice or care if she left . She rose from the edge of the bed , her heart thudding . She unlocked the door and opened it . Eliza Pomeroy , her husband 's current mistress , stood on the other side . " Your husband wants you below , " Eliza said without preamble . Belle stared at her , her stomach taking a sickening turn . " But why ? Is he still not at play ? " She could not imagine what he could possibly want . Eliza looked at her , and her expression was not unkind . " Yes , and he wants you there . I think you had best go straight away . He is not in a pleasant mood . " But then Lucien rarely was , except when it served a purpose . And since she had served her purpose when he married her , she rarely saw the charm he could turn on at will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winding staircase to the floor below . To her bewilderment , Eliza led her to the small saloon where there always seemed to be a card game in progress . She stepped inside the dimly lit room , its stale , rancid scent of smoke , sweat and alcohol assailing her senses . Confused , she saw several men still sitting around one of the small tables . She looked away , embarrassed to be there . Lucien rose in a fluid motion that was rarely impaired by drink . He had removed his coat and his elegant waistcoat was rumpled . He came to her side , smelling of brandy . " Ah , my lovely wife . " His eyes glittered down at her with an odd sort of excitement . She suppressed the shiver that darted through her and forced herself to look at him and speak calmly . " Mrs Pomeroy said that you wished to see me . " " Yes . I do . " His mouth curved in a cruel smile . He caught her wrist in a hard grip and pulled her around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My wife , gentlemen . And my next stake . " She froze . She heard Sir Farley say , " Damn it , Mil-borne . It 's one thing to wager your doxy , but your wife . Not at all the thing . " Lucien 's grip tightened on her wrist . He laughed . " Why not ? I 've nothing else left . She is my possession , even more so than any man 's doxy . So , who will cover ? " " You are mad . " Lord Wroth spoke . Belle 's head jerked up . She had not known he was there . For an instant his eyes met hers , but there was none of the warmth and laughter that had lurked there since she had arrived at this hellish house party . She looked away , humiliated and ashamed beyond belief . " Lucien , please do not do this , " she said softly . He did n't glance at her , his fingers only dug into her arm more , his gaze fixed on Wroth . " So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my wife ? " " What do you want ? " Wroth asked . Her stomach turned even more sickeningly . He could n't possibly be considering Lucien 's offer . " Five hundred pounds , " Lucien said . " One thousand , " Lord Banbury said . His gaze went to her face and fear shot through her . He was thin and had a pallor that seemed unnatural and the whispers she had heard of his sexual proclivities had sickened her . " Two thousand , " Wroth said . His voice was so cold she hardly recognised it . " Very well . Two thousand . " Lucien laughed again . He released her so abruptly , she nearly stumbled . With a numb horror she watched him take his seat . Her eyes never wavered from the game but she hardly knew what took place . Her mind and body no longer seemed connected and when the last of the cards were played , it hardly registered . Not until Lucien stood . " She is yours , Wroth . " Shock coursed through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and came towards her . " Come with me , Belle . " She backed away . " No . I can not . " " You must come with me . You can not stay here . " She stared at him . " I will not do this . " Lucien was at her side . " You have no choice , Belle . " He glanced at Wroth . " Leave us for a moment . " He took her arm and dragged her from the room to the hallway . His eyes glinted . " Do not worry , my dear . It will not be a permanent arrangement . Just a week . " He cupped her chin , his fingers hard against her flesh . She kept perfectly still . " Although I 've no idea why you find the idea so repugnant . I have seen how he looks at you , and how you look at him . I only trust you will show more willingness in his bed than you do in mine , or I doubt he will feel you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he may enjoy tutoring you . I will own , I 've not much patience for blushing virgins . I had thought at your age you might prove a more adept student , but I was wrong . At least you 've no fear of his getting you with child . " His cruelty still managed to pierce her like a sword . She resisted the urge to beg for she knew it would only inflame him more . ( Continues ... )
