ANGER CLASS <p> Barfighters were a minority species in Cheskis 's anger management class . Rather than fight each other , most violent men find it safer and more gratifying to assault their wives and children . Class members tiptoed around the facts . Nothing was as serious as the cops made it sound or they were framed altogether . Just now , for example , Muhammad ended his story with another " I swear to you . " The phrase ended his sentences like a Canadian " ey . " Muhammad was some kind of Pakistani feather merchant , a chubby little man with only a few strands of hair around his head , all of them long and out of place . He 'd had a street altercation with a blood enemy that led to the enemy 's car windows getting smashed with a club . Muhammad contended the enemy had followed him , broken his own windows , and called police . When he told this sad tale he was terribly convincing . Muhammad could probably borrow money from the most hardened cynic . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a lying sack of shit . <p> Cheskis often wondered whether the patient Lorraine , their class instructor , had seen the files and knew the precise nature of the deeds that planted pupils in her class . If so , she never gave it away . She never challenged them when they interpreted events like a roomful of verbal cubists . Lorraine was more concerned with their future than their past . Cheskis suspected she was a rare individual , someone truly capable of controlling her own anger . If only she could convey her secret . But few of the class members cared to know it , even though anger had scarred them irretrievably . <p> Lorraine was in her thirties and slender , like a volleyballer . Slight chest , chin a tad weak , no wedding ring . Her light brown hair was nearly shoulder length and would have looked more attractive , Cheskis concluded , either shorter or longer . She usually wore crisp jeans and blouses and no makeup . Lorraine 's voice still had a youthful bell-like quality , which Cheskis found fetching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nervously or insincerely . Though inescapably pretty , she still struck him as someone suffering from a mild case of wallfloweritis . <p> Now the buck passed from Muhammad to Sybil , whose evil mother had stolen Sybil 's daughter out of spite . Sybil once mentioned that at some point in their relationship she 'd approached her mother 's door with an ax but never quite explained what led up to it , where the ax came from , or what happened after she reached the door . Her stories skipped around , creating mysteries . Most of her circular soliloquies evolved back to her mother 's scabrous intentions . " She and my aunt ( pronounced ohnt ) turned Chiquita against me . Everybody in the church knew it . " <p> Sybil was Cheskis 's only female classmate . Before she started showing up , some of them used to reveal secrets abut themselves , perhaps not the ones that wrenched their hearts in the night , yet digging down far enough to share at least some honest pain with their lost , angry brethren . But Sybil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset the class chemistry and chased away those flashes of candor that might have shed light on the rages that put everyone there . Lorraine had n't figured out yet how to deal with her . Sybil was fortyish and tubby and dressed as though she were eighteen and slim . Her skin was pure Africa , almost blue . She pronounced English with the precision of Elizabeth Taylor , drove to class in a late-model Mercedes , and was missing two or three upper teeth along the left side of her mouth . Nothing about her made sense . Cheskis was forced to think about Sybil more than he 'd like . She was a considerably disordered cog in what was advertised as a mathematically precise universe . Cheskis fought hard to be patient with her . To be angered by a classmate in his anger management class was more irony than he could stand . <p> Angry people popped in and out of class until they completed thirty-five sessions within the allotted time or met with some misfortune , perhaps getting arrested again for a new angry act that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they 'd been warned by the criminal justice system . On some nights enrollees announced it was their thirty-fifth session , but usually when someone disappeared you never knew why . There was an endless stream of replacements , always plenty of fresh doughboys to dump into the trench of their dishonored regiment . Cheskis figured there was enough anger in the world to keep the class going until the end of time . <p> Usually about a dozen people showed up , meeting every Wednesday night in a seedy , backwater office complex . There was no sign on the door and not a single window in the poorly lighted room , which was no bigger than a one-car garage . The place was about as cheerful as last night 's dishes and its hole-in-the-ozone atmosphere was further oppressed by a generalized , palpable shame . Class members were ashamed of their anger , ashamed of getting caught by the cops , or both . And they felt sorry for themselves . Cheskis too . Every night thousands of people all over the world ended up in bar fights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it . Such emotions inspired no camaraderie . Members of the class pushed their chairs back along the wall in a circle to get as far away from the others as possible . <p> During a fortuitous break in Sybil 's monologue , Lorraine , always on the alert for such opportunities , jumped in to steer the discussion back on course . " Is anger , " she asked , " ever helpful ? Can it have positive benefits ? " Sybil , as always , raised her hand . everyone else , as always , did n't . " What do you think , Marvin ? " <p> Marvin , who wore lots of blue , signifying his status as a Crip gangster in good standing , viewed class proceedings as though he were on a promontory looking down on a distant , inconsequential piece of ground . He projected enormous physical power just sitting there , like an idling diesel . His muscled brown-black arms were crisscrossed with scars and schoolyard tattoos . In response to Lorraine , he shifted his gaze and studied her as though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , he said . " Yeah . " <p> " Yes what ? " unflummoxed Lorraine said . <p> " Yes , it can be helpful , " he said . <p> " How so ? " <p> " ' Cause , " interrupted Sybil , " when people are messing with you , you ca n't just sit there . That 's not life . " Sybil was ready to pull her oratory train out of the station when Lorraine repeated the question to Marvin . <p> " Anger can keep you sharp , " he replied . " Keep you aware . If you do n't get too stupid . " <p> " Martin Luther King did n't get angry , " Lorraine said . " He rejected violence . But he won lots of battles . " Some class members smiled conspiratorially , silently announcing to the others that this nanve cog in the social-work machine must have her head in Leave It to Beaver-land , but meanwhile they 'd just sit there and listen to her fairy tales if that 's what it took to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think anger helps you , " volunteered Luis , a neatly dressed young man who in past sessions had made it clear without ever quite saying it that his girlfriend cheated on him in a recurring game that was the focus of both their lives . " It 's never helped me . Never . " Lorraine nodded compassionately . Cheskis , seeing that the discussion was , for once , bypassing Sybil , said to Lorraine , " May I ask what you think ? " <p> " Of course , " she said , " but not if it 's a way of bottling up your own thoughts . " From Lorraine , this had to be classified as a rebuke . <p> " I just want to hear your own answer , " he said . " Honest . " <p> " I think , " Lorraine said , " anger , on rare occasions , can be helpful . " <p> Anger-plagued enrollees cocked their heads to the side like curious spaniels . <p> " Would you give an example ? " Cheskis asked her . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is motivated by compassion , it can be a catalyst for positive action . Say when Klansmen murdered four little girls in a church . That made some people angry without making them violent or full of hatred . It created positive energy . But that was an exception . Anger almost always is harmful , particularly to the person experiencing the anger . " In every session she found an interval to interject her thesis that anger damages the angry individual more than the target . It even , she sometimes pointed out , contorts people 's features , making them resemble beasts . " Losing your temper doubles your punishment , " she told them , first with the event that triggered it , " then with the anger itself , eating away at everything that 's good in you . " <p> " But when people are doing something to you , " Sybil said , " what are you supposed to do ? " She 'd asked this many times , hoping perhaps , that just once the answer would endorse her right to swing an ax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " perhaps you could help us with this one . What 's the preferred response when someone is clearly attempting to ... " <p> " Mess with us , " Sybil said , smiling to herself . <p> Alton was a tall , stick-figured , Scandinavian-looking fellow in his thirties who clung to the lower rungs of some white-collar enterprise . His clothes always had something just a little wrong . Worn-down heels , a wrinkled jacket , Kmart-looking tie . No one would mistake him for a success . Alton took careful notes and once said vehemently that he just hated it when people lied to him . Cheskis sized him up as a serial wife beater . <p> Alton picked up his personalized anger folder filled with notes and printed handouts , thumbed through it hastily , then said , " We should count to ten , right ? " <p> " That 's what we do when we start to feel angry , " Sybil said . <p> " Right , that 's what I said , " Alton replied testily . <p> " Sybil does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question was how best to react when someone is unpleasant to us . " <p> " Is n't that what I just said ? " objected the clearly frustrated Alton . <p> " But someone might not necessarily be angry when someone is unpleasant to them , " Lorraine said . " So it 's not the same question . " <p> Cheskis , staring at a curve between the buttons in the material of Lorraine 's white blouse , spied just a speck of creamy flesh . With a sudden movement she caught his gaze , her smile not wavering as he looked away . " Could n't there be a difference between reacting to our own anger and reacting to a negative event ? Lee , would you care to answer that ? " <p> " I guess if you reacted to a negative event correctly , you would n't get angry in the first place , " Cheskis said . " So you would n't be dealing with your anger . " <p> " Precisely , " Lorraine said . " Learn to cut your temper off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not less powerful . Because you 'll be in control of your own mind . You do n't let some foolish driver or angry partner or inconsiderate boss take over . Your mind belongs to you , and your mind actually works better . Lee , if you do n't mind , when you were boxing , did you ever lose your temper in the ring ? And if so , were you helped or hurt by it ? " <p> Several sessions ago , when Cheskis had been cornered into talking about the barfight that landed him here , he let it slip that years earlier he 'd boxed competitively . Clearly Lorraine , at least , found this information worth retaining . " I do n't even remember that far back , " he replied . <p> Lorraine closed her eyes in a long , slow signal of regret . She let Sybil take over again while Cheskis tried to recall how he could have been so stupid as to reveal that piece of his past . But when people are called upon to disclose private thoughts to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dodging questions provides information . At some point someone had asked Cheskis what he hoped for his future , and as he gave a dishonest answer it occurred to him that he had n't really considered his future in years . His goals were no more insightful than those of the average schmo or schmoe-ette who yearned for a newer automobile , thinner thighs , or some other person , place , or thing to bestow eternal happiness . And it was at that point he mentioned some trivial detail about an opponent he 'd faced in college . <p> After Sybil wasted the remaining minutes , Lorraine took her customary post-session station behind a card table . The students lined up to pay her fifteen dollars each so they could rush to whatever form of freedom awaited them beyond the door . Cheskis decided this was the night to see Lorraine privately . He 'd rehearsed different approaches for weeks , only to walk out defeated . He wanted to speak to her without Sybil or Alton or anyone else around . She always took a little time to assemble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the little washroom to check his appearance before the big moment . Not so bad , he decided . But he could n't pick up even the slightest whiff of that fifty-dollar cologne . The ads for such stuff never mentioned it had to be applied every ten minutes . <p> When he came out , Lorraine was already gone . So was everyone else except Marvin the Crip . At first Cheskis assumed Marvin was waiting for the toilet and that he might still catch up with Lorraine , but no , Marvin blocked his path . " So you know about fighting , " he said . He pronounced the words with a voice as blank as his eyes , bearing down from six foot three at least . Cheskis could n't recall anyone from the class ever saying anything to him or anyone else before or after a session . No one asked what school you went to or whether you watched the Lakers last night . The avoidance of everyday pleasantries was built into the structure of their fluctuating little group and everyone picked up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even though your ordinary citizen carefully fashions life in such a way as to never , ever be alone with somebody like Marvin , who was close enough to send off traces of aftershave . Cheskis examined Marvin 's precise words . So you know about fighting . Was that even a question ? " Years and years ago , " Cheskis said at last . <p> " I 'm looking for a gym , " Marvin said . " For a place to-you know-box . " <p> " You 've boxed before ? " <p> " Some . " <p> Marvin had broad , dark-chocolate features . They lacked the sharp lines of an Adonis , but he was a handsome fellow whose blank-nasty eyes were large and intelligent . If he wanted a favor , why did n't he take the edge off his attitude ? Besides , what he was asking did n't make sense . Thanks to insurance underwriters and the over-lawyering of America , boxing instruction had been driven from public schools and YMCAs . It survived only in the kind of neighborhood where Marvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give indigent , fatherless kids an alternative to streets and gangs . Marvin must know of these gyms , even though he was too old for a kids ' program . <p> " Where did you work out ? " Cheskis asked him . <p> " Gym 's not there anymore . " <p> " Looking to turn pro ? " <p> " I just said I wanted to box . " <p> Cheskis could ask Eddie to take a look at him . But an anger classmate would be an embarrassing presence in the gym , his gym , soiling it for Cheskis even if no one knew their connection . It took Cheskis a lifetime to find his gym . " I do n't know anything about boxing in L.A. , " Cheskis said . " I ca n't help you . " He hated Marvin for making him lie and for looking at him like that , making it clear he could see through the lie . Just when Cheskis found the courage to talk to Lorraine , he had to postpone it another whole week because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his breath came too fast , and he felt it starting . He was pleased he could recall the proper steps . Assess the situation and examine my beliefs about it . Well , this person-a threatening person-was probably angry with him . He was probably angry with everyone . Call a time out . The formula was failing , but at least he 'd managed to roll it out-a small victory . Cheskis surveyed Marvin as he would an opponent-what he might do , what Cheskis might do back-or do first . The game calmed him . What kind of a dick am I ? Fighting makes me calm . <p> " That was a nice little story you told , in the class that time , " Marvin said . <p> Cheskis could n't tell whether Marvin was sincere or playing the dozens-needling him black-man style . He was already weary of trying to interpret the man 's vagueness and double meanings . " I 'll see you next time , " Cheskis said . He stepped forward , forcing Marvin to make a choice . He stepped aside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hurry , which made him even less likely to find Lorraine . <p>
