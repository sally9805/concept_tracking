BRITISH BRIGADIER BENEDICT ARNOLD 'S LAST " HOMECOMNG " ONLY SERVED TO SECURE HIS PLACE IN THE HISTORY BOOKS AS AMERICA 'S MOST DESPISED TRAITOR . // Opposite : As New London burns , Abigail Hinman , wife of privateer Captain Elisha Hinman , makes an unsuccessful attempt to shoot the British commander-and former resident of nearby Norwich , Conn. - Brigadier Benedict Arnold ( Primedia Archive ) . // A FLEET OF warships and troop transports glided quietly across the waters of Long Island Sound toward the Connecticut coastline . The commander of the soldiers aboard the transports knew this country well . He had been born and raised in the town of Norwich , a dozen miles inland from the harbor before him . As a ship 's captain and a merchant trader , he had often sailed these waters . It was September 6 , 1781 , and Brigadier Benedict Arnold of the British army was coming home .

Although battles had been waged around Newport , R.I. , 40 miles to the east , and at New York City , 100 miles to the west , thus far British operations in the region had been limited to blockading and occasional raids by small landing parties . That was about to change . By the late summer of 1781 , the British presence in the Northern colonies was limited to New York City and its immediate environs . Their principal commander in the South , Lt. Gen. Charles , Lord Cornwallis , had moved northward into Virginia after a long , fruitless campaign in the Carolinas . As Cornwallis ' force settled in Yorktown , General George Washington 's Continental Army and his French allies were reportedly turning their backs on New York and marching to strike at the vulnerable Cornwallis . Rather than reinforce his threatened forces there , however , Lt. Gen. Sir Henry Clinton , the British commander in chief based in New York , decided to take action in the local theater , perhaps partly in the hope that a diversion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an attractive choice for a quick operation . Its fine harbor , at the mouth of the broad Thames River , had sheltered numerous privateers that preyed upon hundreds of British merchant ships . Only a month before , the merchantman Hannah , loaded with a cargo valued at 80,000 pounds sterling , had been captured and carried into New London . The town 's warehouses were packed with goods that could supply Washington 's forces in the coming winter . New London 's harbor was protected by Fort Trumbull , a waterfront battery on a small peninsula to the south , and by Fort Griswold , a much stronger work atop steep Groton Heights , directly across the Thames from the town . In addition , a small earthwork , derisively known as " Fort Folly " or " Fort Nonsense , " guarded the land approaches to New London from the south and west . Lieutenant Colonel William Ledyard , a member of a prominent local family , commanded the coastal defenses . Except for about 50 Connecticut state soldiers divided between the garrisons at Forts Trumbull and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although the rolls carried 2,000 names , far fewer men could actually be mustered during an emergency . Clinton 's choice to command the expeditionary force was equally compelling . Not only was Benedict Arnold familiar with New London from childhood , but his presence would draw American ire . In the first five years since he had learned of the outbreak of fighting at Lexington and Concord in April 1775 , Arnold had gone from Connecticut militia leader to major general , suffering two leg wounds and distinguishing himself at Quebec , Valcour Island and Saratoga . In 1780 he was placed in charge of West Point , on the Hudson River . Intensely ambitious , disgruntled over delays in promotion and angered by charges that he had mishandled funds , Arnold had already begun secret negotiations with the British . He agreed to surrender West Point in exchange for a commission in the British army plus a large cash reward . Through mischance the plot was discovered before it could be carried out , but Arnold escaped to the English lines . As a British brigadier general , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter and spring of 1781 before being recalled . He had been in New York for two months when Clinton agreed to his proposal to attack New London . Arnold 's heterogeneous strike force typified the British army in America by that stage of the war . The regulars were represented by the veteran 38th , 40th and 54th regiments of foot . A detachment of Hessian light infantry-Jgers-four units of Loyalists , including the " American Legion " raised under Arnold 's personal direction , and a few artillery pieces completed his roster of more than 1,800 men . As the British approached New London in the early morning of September 6 , an unexpected shift in wind direction forced the ships to beat back and forth in a zigzag course . At dawn Fort Griswold 's garrison sighted two dozen transports and their warship escorts . Orderly Sergeant Rufus Avery summoned the fort 's commander , Captain William Latham , who immediately sent for Ledyard . The colonel was not altogether surprised-a spy had already warned of a British fleet anchored off the north shore of Long Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guns fired to warn the countryside-and the local militia-of an enemy approach . Within seconds , however , a third cannon sounded , fired from one of the British ships at the river mouth . Ledyard realized that spies had betrayed his alarm system , for three shots identified a friendly vessel . The American commander dispatched couriers to muster the militia regardless of the confusion in signals . While the British fleet still labored against the wind to enter the harbor , Ledyard crossed the Thames to confer with civilian officials in New London . Recognizing that Fort Griswold offered his only realistic defense , Ledyard arranged for gunpowder from the town 's storehouses to be carried across the river to that fort . Ledyard also sent a courier with news of the impending attack to Governor Jonathan Trumbull 's home in Lebanon . Once warned of their danger , ship captains roused their crews and tried to escape upriver , but they had to contend with the same unfavorable wind that was delaying the British . // Adverse winds delayed the British landing at the mouth of the Thames @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London while Lt. Col. Edmund Eyre took a detachment up the river 's east bank toward Groton. // Having sent his pregnant wife away from the town , Ledyard crossed back to Fort Griswold . There , he found a disappointing number of militiamen , partly due to the confusion arising from the British signaling ruse but also because there had been numerous false alarms in the past . Ledyard called his officers to a council of war . Amos Stanton , a veteran Continental Army captain , urged that troops be sent to the shore to oppose the expected landing , and then to harass and delay any British advance while more militia arrived . Ledyard , however , probably mindful of the lack of discipline in the militia , decided to make his stand in Fort Griswold itself . ARNOLD FINALLY MANAGED TO anchor several hours behind schedule and divided his force into two parts . Arnold himself would lead a force of some 800 men , including the 38th Foot , three Loyalist battalions and aJager detachment , with one cannon . They were to land on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , then march three miles north on high ground to approach Fort Trumbull and New London from the west . The remainder of the British force , including the 40th and 54th Foot , the 3rd Battalion of New Jersey Volunteers , the rest of the Jgers and two guns , was to land east of the harbor entrance . Commanded by Lt. Col. Edmund Eyre of the 54th , this detachment would attack Fort Griswold , which Loyalist informants had reported was still under construction . Arnold 's western column did n't finish coming ashore by small boats until 10 a.m . About 40 American civilians and militiamen had gathered to oppose the landing , with the pointed encouragement of family and friends . John Hempstead 's wife shouted after him " not to let me hear that you are Shot in the Back . " The Americans , however , were quickly driven off by covering fire from British warships . lieutenant Hempstead later recalled that " ther Cannon ... balls flew over Our heads like hale Stones . " Arnold 's troops started inland , driving small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies of the 38th Foot and a detachment of Loyalists to march directly against Fort Trumbull . The Connecticut-born Loyalist commander , Captain Nathan Frink , was well qualified to guide them-his sister lived in New London . The fort was a riverside battery intended only for defense against ships sailing up the Thames . Its 23-man garrison , commanded by Captain Adam Shapley , fired one volley of grapeshot that killed or wounded five British , then spiked their cannons and fled to boats on the riverbank . Although several of his men were captured or wounded , Shapley brought the rest across the Thames to Fort Griswold . Among them was another member of the Hempstead family , Sergeant Stephen Hempstead , who had previously served under his friend , Captain Nathan Hale , a former New London schoolteacher , and had accompanied Hale during his doomed spy mission . He later volunteered as a crewman on a fire ship in an unsuccessful attempt to burn a British ship-of-the-line at New York . Badly wounded at the Battle of Harlem Heights in October 1776 , he returned home to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field service , he had enlisted in Connecticut state forces for garrison duty in the coastal defenses . As he advanced north , Arnold realized that although wind and tide were still holding the American ships in the harbor , they might soon escape upriver . He sent a messenger to cross the Thames with orders for Eyre to hurry his attack against Fort Griswold so that its cannons could be turned against the American vessels . While Fort Trumbull was being captured , Arnold led the rest of his force along the main road to New London . South of Fort Folly , 100 militiamen had gathered . Colonel Joseph Harris , commander of New London 's Independent Militia companies , rode past , and when the troops called upon him to take charge , Harris replied , " You must excuse me , gentlemen , as I have a violent sick-headache this morning , and can hardly sit on my horse , " and departed . The disorganized militia scattered . // An illustration by Howard Pyle depicts a recruiting station for privateers in New London-the sort of activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Continental Army and made it a prize target for the British . // As John Hempstead neared Fort Folly , a friend called to ask if he would care for some gin . " I told him yes &; thanky two , " Hempstead later wrote . After taking a drink of " holland Jinn " with several other would-be defenders , Hempstead helped hide the remaining bottles of liquor from the British in a patch of high weeds . He was later happy to record " they never fownd the case of jinn . " After being fired upon by green-jacketed skirmishers , Hempstead ran to the fort , only to find it already abandoned . He fled , dodging more enemy bullets , and the British entered the fort unopposed , as an American onlooker shouted , " Wilkom God damyou to fort Non Sence . " After brushing aside another small militia force on the high ground above the town , Arnold quickly occupied New London . Many of the inhabitants had fled to the countryside . Arnold found that the wind had shifted , and thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inspecting the fortifications across the river with a field glass , he saw to his dismay that Fort Griswold looked far more formidable than his spies had claimed . He immediately dispatched a new order to Eyre to suspend any attack on the fort . PERCHED AT THE TOP OF A HILL 120 feet above the river , Fort Griswold formed a rough trapezoid , about 70 by 90 yards . Bastions at the northwest and southwest corners and a projection in the eastern face could deliver flanking fire against any enemy trying to scale the stone-and-earth walls . A dry moat along the northern and eastern faces augmented the 12-foot-high walls . The southern and western walls were considered tall enough to make a moat there unnecessary . Partway down the steep slope to the river , an additional battery of heavy guns pointed out across the Thames . A small redoubt a few hundred yards east guarded against any approach from that direction . The main gate , in the northern wall , was shielded by a ravelin outside the fort . The narrow sally port , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was its only other entrance . Further obstacles to approach were provided by abatis , bundles of sharpened branches outside the moat , and by sharpened stakes sticking out from the walls themselves . Inside the fort , a barracks for the permanent garrison stood along the eastern edge of the small parade ground . A powder magazine was built into the southwestern bastion , where the fort 's flagpole stood . About half of the fort 's 22 cannons faced west toward the river , while the rest peered out through embrasures in the parapets . Firing steps had been built between the cannons for the musket-armed defenders . Strong though Fort Griswold looked , its rotted timber cannon platforms were liable to collapse during firing . Although Ledyard had brought more gunpowder for the magazine that morning , few preweighed and bagged charges were available . Most of the powder would have to be measured out for each shot , slowing the reloading process and increasing the danger of accidental explosion from the loose powder . Even with the arrival of Shapley s force from across the river , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most were local farmers , of whom at least a dozen shared Sergeant Rufus Avery 's surname , but two men of African descent and a Pequot Indian also carried arms . The most valuable of Ledyard 's reinforcements were crewmen from privateers unable to escape up-river , who at least had experience in firing cannons . When Colonel Eyre 's force disembarked on the Groton side of the Thames , he decided to leave his cannons behind to follow at their own pace , accompanied by the battalion of New Jersey Volunteers . Eyre himself pressed ahead with the 40th and 54th Foot and the Jgers . Eyre sent Captain George Beckwith forward under a flag of truce to demand Fort Griswold 's surrender , warning that , under the rules of war , no quarter would be given if the garrison refused his offer . Beckwith was kept waiting while Ledyard , in accordance with 18th-century military protocol , communicated formally through an American officer of a rank equal to that of the British messenger . Rufus Avery recorded the colonel 's final answer : " He should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be what it might . " Arnold 's order to suspend the attack had not yet made its way across the river , so Eyre launched an assault before the Loyalists and the artillery came up . Eyre would lead the elite British Light Infantry and Grenadier companies north past the fort , then turn and strike the north and east faces . The line companies , commanded by Major William Montgomery of the 40th , were to attack the south wall while the Jgers screened the approaches to the fort . As the British formations maneuvered and captured the outlying redoubt , the Americans opened fire . One blast of double grapeshot from an 18-pounder cannon aimed by privateer captain Elias Halsey tore a wide hole in a British column-Avery later heard that about 20 men had been killed or wounded by that single shot . When in position , both British columns tried to push their way past the obstacles and up the walls . Eyre was wounded and carried from the field . Some of the Americans later remembered repulsing three separate assault waves in half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a musket ball cut through the halyard of Fort Griswold 's flagpole. seeing its striped banner flutter to the ground , British soldiers thought the defenders were surrendering . They cheered , fired a volley into the air and rushed eagerly toward the fort . The Americans , raising their flag on a pikestaff , again opened fire . // A 1776 sketch of New London . Until 1781 the closest war had come to the port was at Newport , R.I. , 40 miles to the east . Its fine harbor , however , came to attract the attention of British Lt. Gen. Henry Clinton . // Incensed at this seeming treachery , the British furiously pressed their renewed attack . The Grenadier and Light Infantry companies of the 40th Foot shifted left to the fort 's south face and scaled it without ladders by climbing on one another 's shoulders . Major Montgomery was one of the first to make his way up the wall before being mortally wounded by a pike reportedly wielded by Jordan Freeman , Colonel Ledyards black orderly . Finding the rate of musket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossing cannon balls down upon the British . " I commanded an eighteen-pounder on the south side of the gate , " wrote Stephen Hempstead years later , " and while in the act of righting my gun , a ball passed through the embrasure , struck me a little above the right ear , grazing the skull , and cutting off the veins , which bled profusely . A handkerchief was tied around it , and I continued at my duty . Discovering , some little time after , that a British soldier had broken a picket at the bastion on my left , and was forcing himself through the hole , whilst the men stationed there were gazing at the battle which raged opposite to them , cried , " my brave fellows , the enemy are breaking in behind you , ' and raised my pike to dispatch the intruder , when a ball struck my left arm at the elbow , and my pike fell to the ground . Nevertheless , I grasped it with my right hand , and with the men , who turned and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across to the southwest bastion to see a wave of British soldiers overrunning its defenders . When Fort Griswold had been constructed , a rough outcropping of rock was incorporated into the wall at one angle of the bastion . British attackers now scaled that outcropping like a ladder and pushed the Americans back . One soldier leapt down on to the fort 's parade field and tried to open the sally port , but he fell wounded . A comrade finally succeeded in unbarring the gate . Ledyard , certain that he could n't organize a counterattack to retake the walls , called for his men to cease fighting . Chaos erupted . " When they had overpowered us and driven us from our stations at the breastwork of the fort , " Avery wrote , " the officers and men ... quit their posts , and went on the open parade in the fort , where the enemy had every opportunity to massacre us , there was about six of the enemy to one of us . The enemy mounted the parapet seemingly all as one , swung their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them they did not kill with ball they meant to kill with the bayonet . " British soldiers crossed the parade field to unbar the main gate , admitting more Redcoats . What happened next would spark controversy . Sergeant Avery , seeking refuge in the barracks , saw Ledyard approach a British officer , raising and lowering his sword as a signal of surrender . Avery turned to enter the barracks , then looked again towards Ledyard , only to see the American commander lying dead on the ground . // A British drawing of Fort Griswold . When the fort 's banner was shot down , the British thought the garrison was surrendering and regarded its continued resistance as an act of treachery . // Although no witness reported actually seeing what happened at the time , Americans were quick to believe a dramatic tale of Ledyard 's death . Only three days after the battle , one local leader wrote Governor Trumbull that " Colo . Ledyard ... thot. proper to Surrender himself with the Garison pris- s oners , &; presented his Sword to an officer who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brave Commandant when the Ruffans ( no doubt by order ) pierced him in many places with Bayonets . " Trumbull repeated the story in a letter to Washington a few days later . A tradition grew up that a British officer , often identified as a Loyalist , had called out , " Who commands this fort ? " Ledyard supposedly replied , " I did , but you do now , " at the same time handing over his sword , hilt first . The officer is then said to have plunged Ledyard 's own sword into his body . Many years after the battle , several survivors , undoubtedly influenced by decades of propaganda , claimed they had personally witnessed his perfidious murder . Whether he was indeed killed by a sword or a British bayonet , as some evidence suggests , Ledyard and many of his men were in fact cut down after the fort 's surrender . British soldiers were enraged at the loss of many comrades , and American lieutenant Obadiah Perkins was told by one of his captors that " every Man ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) this is a propur storm , and you fought us after your Colours were struck . " Adding to British rancor , Ensign Alexander Gray of the 40th Foot wrote , " After the troops carried the work the Enemy fired from their Barracks and wounded several men . " Avery recalled : They killed and wounded nearly every man in the fort as quick as they could , which was done in about one minute . I expected my time to come with the rest . One mad-looking fellow put his bayonet to my side , and swore , " bejasus , he would skipper me . " I looked him very earnestly in the face and eyes , and asked for mercy and to spare my life . He attempted three times to put the bayonet in me , but I must say I believe God forbade him , for I was completely in his power , as well as others that was present with the enemy . The enemy at the same time massacred lieut . Enoch Stanton within four or five feet of me . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood .... They discharged their guns into the magazine among the dead and wounded , and some well ones , and some they killed and wounded . That platoon fell back , and another came forward to discharge their guns .... As they made ready to fire , a British officer came suddenly around the corner of the magazine , and very quickly raised his sword , exclaiming , " Stop firing ! You 'll send us all to hell together ! ' Their language was bad as well as their conduct ... they very soon left off killing , and then went stripping and robbing the dead and wounded , and also those that were not wounded . Several months after the battle , Captain Solomon Perkins remembered a moment of horror : I with a number of others being on the Parade perceiving they gave no quarters we retired into a room in one of the barracks in hope of escaping their fury , but an officer of the British came to the door of the barracks &; ordered us to lay down our arms . We accordingly laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us &; told us we ought all to be put to Death immediately , upon this another officer with some soldiers came to the door &; asked the first officer why he did not put us to death , the other replied we had begged for quarters , he again replied he would be damned if we should have quarters or words to that amount , &; immediately ordered his men to fire in upon us . They fired &; some they wounded &; we crowded up into the opposite corner of the barracks being shut up &; could make no escape , they continued firing &; killing , &; we kept pressing against the partition of the barracks &; burst out into the other room &; as I was getting the door I received a whole charge into my neck the ball coming out at the opposite side , this brought me down &; nearly deprived me of my senses after which they put a ball through my body , pierced me three times in the stomach with a bayonet .... Americans subsequently claimed that almost all of the defenders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his men to lay down their arms . In those chaotic minutes , the fate of individuals was often a matter of chance . While Avery was spared , Stephen Hempstead received a third wound , this time a bayonet thrust into his hip . Some survivors owed their lives to the intervention of British officers . Several escaped by leaping down from the ramparts and running for their lives . A few , pretending to be dead , hid among the piled bodies of their comrades . British officers struggled to restore order . The American prisoners , most of them wounded , were gathered on the parade field . Those able to walk were escorted aboard British vessels . Several , too badly injured to be transported to New York , were placed in a wagon to be brought down to a house on the riverbank . The heavily laden vehicle broke loose as it was being rolled down the steep slope and crashed into an apple tree at the hill 's base . Although this was clearly an accident , American propagandists claimed that British soldiers had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on it as it sped out of control . // Although no witness could confirm it , the story spread among the Americans that Fort Griswold 's commander , Lt. Col. William Ledyard , surrendered his sword to a Loyalist officer , who then ran it through him . // While some British soldiers spiked the guns and knocked off their trunnions , others hastily buried their dead , including Major Montgomery , outside the fort . The slain Americans were left where they fell . The British had suffered 47 dead and 133 wounded , almost a quarter of the assault force . Many of the wounded , both British and American , would die in the coming weeks . Once Fort Griswold was cleared and the British had marched back toward the mouth of the Thames with their wounded , a Captain Lemoine of the Royal Artillery poured a powder train into the magazine and then set fire to the barracks . A party of American militia watched the British depart , then hurried into the fort . They scattered the powder train , keeping the magazine from exploding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the local families came to find and take home the bodies of husbands , sons , fathers and brothers . ON THE WESTERN BANK OF THE Thames , Arnold 's men , guided by Loyalists , set fire to about a dozen ships in the river and searched the waterfront . Public buildings and storehouses filled with the fruits of privateering voyages were burned . Americans claimed that the British soldiers deliberately set fire to private houses at Arnold s direct order . Arnold later reported that the widespread destruction was accidental , writing : " An immense quantity of European and West India Goods were found in the stores ... the whole of which was burnt with the stores , which proved to contain a large Quantity of Powder unknown to us . The explosion of the Powder and change of wind soon after the stores were fired communicated the flames to that part of the Town , which was , notwithstanding every effort to prevent it , unfortunately destroyed . " By that time , John Hempstead had come upon a group of 500 Americans on a hill to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Devel do nt yoo Go down &; meet the Enemy ? " Picket Lattimer , captain of one of the independent companies of New London militia , replied " that he would not Resk his life to Save other mens property . " Ironically , unknown to Lattimer , his own house was among the first to be burned . Although British soldiers were detailed to protect the houses of invalids , tales of rampant pillaging and the levying of unofficial ransoms to spare individual dwellings were common . Ignored , however , were reports of looting by Americans taking advantage of the disorder . Fifteen-year-old Jonathan Brooks sat by his house while watching for the British to enter the town . He later wrote : " The silence was soon broken by the entrance of five or six shabby looking fellows into the street on the full run .... They passed me without notice , so intent were they probably on the prospect before them , for they shouted as they passed , " by G-d , we 'll have fine plunder by-and-by . ' Very soon I heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a storehouse open , which contained the goods of the prize ship Hannah .... The goods were flying out of the store , and I should think thirty or forty persons were loading themselves with plunder and scampering off . " In all , 143 buildings , including 65 houses , were burned in New London , with more than 20 others across the river in Groton . Before Arnold left , a former Norwich neighbor , Abigail Dolebear-now the wife of privateer captain Elisha Hinman-reportedly tried to shoot the turncoat . Depending on the version , she either balked at shooting him in the back , shot his hat off or simply missed . Arnold marched his men away in the late afternoon . Brooks , who had left New London as the British approached , now rode back to a scene of desolation : I entered the north end of the town , passed into Main Street about twenty rods , when the heat and smoke of the burning buildings was such that I could not urge the mare on . I , however , retreated back about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through . I had just cleared the burning district at that point , when there was a store , containing a large quantity of gunpowder , blew up , which filled the air with smoke and fragments , which fell around me in every direction .... I saw a heavy fire raging on the parade , which was the Court House , Jail , Episcopal Church , &c.; I , of course , could not pass that way , and , indeed , the smoke was so dense-there being but little wind-no object whatever could be discovered .... Thus you may understand that I passed through the principal streets of New London on the afternoon of the 6th of September , 1781 , and never saw a single living creature , except one singed cat , that ran across the street when the store blew . The British fleet sailed for New York the next morning . Although a great quantity of military stores had been destroyed and many American militiamen and civilians had been killed or captured , those results did not balance the severe casualties suffered at Fort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while expressing " the greatest satisfaction from the ardor of the troops , " also stated that he could " not but lament with the deepest concern the heavy loss in officers and men . " Moreover , any hope Clinton had of the New London raid 's diverting Washington 's attention from Virginia was soon dashed . Cornwallis ' surrender at Yorktown would come only six weeks after Arnold 's raid . The burning of New London and the massacre of Fort Griswold 's defenders exacerbated American hatred of Benedict Arnold , who soon sailed to England . The favor he acquired in royal circles was soon lost when the Tory government fell and was replaced by the antiwar Whigs . He spent the remainder of his life in futile attempts to secure wealth and acceptance . He died on June 14 , 1801 , at age 60 , in debt and widely scorned .
