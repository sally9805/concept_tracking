IT 'S EASY , FROM THIS DISTANCE of time , safely protected by the years , to look back on those days with fondness . The scars have faded ; they are hardly noticeable anymore unless you look for them . I even shave sometimes now , and I do n't have to worry about people staring . Still , most of the time I wear a beard . Old habits die hard . <p> The scars , faded to almost nothing , are the only evidence left that anything happened at all . Fickle memory , merciful in its selectivity , no longer haunts me ; I no longer see the faces of my friends when I look at strangers . Even the dreams have stopped , almost . Each day I walk down to the caf , sit at my little table on the sidewalk , read my paper and drink my coffee . It is a small life , lacking any significance or ambition . It does not crave excitement or fulfillment . It is enough for me , now . <p> MEETING I <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from my newspaper in surprise to see an older man standing by my table . I took him in with a well-trained glance - tallish , slender , dark suit , long coat , black umbrella , black leather gloves , a neatly folded copy of Le Monde tucked under his arm . The enemy . So intent had I been in my search for evidence any of them might yet be alive , he had been able to walk right up to me . I did n't have a gun . The Other did , I was sure . " Sure , pull up a seat , " I said . I gathered my New York Times , now irrelevant , and folded it neatly . <p> " Thank you . " He pulled a chair over from the next table and I moved a bit so he could sit next to me , with his back to the caf window , watching the traffic . <p> Bernard emerged from the caf and hesitated for a moment . I had never had company at my table before . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " My name is ... Smith . " He had debated telling me his real name , but decided against it . It did n't matter ; I would n't have been able to pronounce it anyway . " How long have you been coming here ? " Smith asked . <p> " A few years , I guess . My name 's Nash . " <p> Smith nodded . " I thought so . We accounted for all the rest . " <p> " I thought we got all of you . " <p> Smith looked at my newspaper . " But you were n't sure . " <p> " No . " <p> We watched from under the awning as people hurried past in the light rain . We were the only two who had chosen to occupy a table outside on such a dreary day ; the other caf patrons were crowded within , sharing warmth and oxygen , but when I arrived that morning the rserv sign was perched with precision atop the two-day-old newspaper , as it had been every day for the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truck rumbled up the street , over the cobblestones , leaving behind the scent of diesel . " There were no survivors , " Smith said , " on either side . " <p> THE BEGINNING <p> When telling a story it is traditional , I suppose , to start at the beginning . I do not know when the war began , perhaps a week before I answered the help wanted ad in the Times classifieds , perhaps a thousand years . I can only begin where the story begins for me , with my Honorable Discharge from the military . I had done well there , but somewhere along the way I was branded " not a team player " - an entirely fair assessment . After ten years of service which included several awards , medals , and other worthless trinkets , the military and I had had enough of each other . A handshake , a slap on the back , and I was a civilian . <p> Back then I was even less well-equipped to be a civilian than I was to be a soldier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bouncer , and the like - and washed out of the police academy for many of the same reasons I was not in the military anymore . Not a team player . Attitude problem , they called it when they did n't have to write it down . <p> The ad had my name on it . Not literally , of course , but it might as well have . It might even have been written especially for me to read . The ad carried the logo of the FBI and was looking for ex-military with specialized skills and the ability to work independently , with little or no supervision . Pension calculated based on date first joined the military . Equal opportunity employer , and so on . I called the number , gave my name , was given a time to appear for the interview . <p> " Can we make it earlier ? I have to work then . " Work , if I recall correctly , was on a construction site . <p> " No . " The woman 's voice was cold and firm . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I imagined her pay was docked for each word she spoke . <p> " Well , I guess I 'll have to quit my job then , to come to your friggin ' interview . " <p> " All right , " she said , unaffected by my anger . She gave the address once and cut the connection . I looked at the ad again . It looked promising , but already they were giving me the runaround . <p> Of course , I did quit my job , and I did go to the interview . The building was a nondescript and soulless office building on the outskirts of downtown , and there was no indication that the FBI was anywhere inside . I found the appropriate suite on the fifth floor and gave my name to the receptionist . " Please be seated , " was all she said . <p> I sat on a vinyl-clad couch that looked like it had been salvaged from the 1970s . On the wall behind my head was a poster proclaiming the virtues of patience . On the wall facing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaching , and in fancy script beneath explained that success went to those who dared to break barriers . On a low table in front of me were well-worn financial magazines from last month and today 's Times . At each end of the couch potted palm trees concealed security cameras , in addition to those in the ceiling . I occupied my time pretending to thumb through Forbes while spotting the cameras I was n't supposed to be able to find . While doing that I listened to the activity of the receptionist . She moved with ruthless efficiency and spoke on the phone with the same economy of words as the woman I had first called , but her voice was not the same . <p> Her phone purred softly . She picked up the receiver , said nothing and set it down again . " Through that door , " she said in my direction , then returned to her other duties . I stood , opened the only other door I was supposed to know about , and found myself in a long hallway with closed doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle of the hall , waiting for someone to stop me . If no one did , I 'd just turn around and go home . It was spring ; there were more construction jobs out there . <p> Near the end of the hall one of the doors was partially open , and as I approached a voice came from within , " Come in , Mr. Nash . " The voice was dusty and stained by cigarettes . <p> I pushed open the door and took one step inside . The office was small and gray , washed of color by the dingy light coming through the window . A small man , withered and even grayer , stood up behind his desk as I entered . " Thank you for coming , Mr. Nash . My name is Cain . " He offered his hand . His skin was dry and cold . I was n't sure if Cain was his first or last name , or perhaps just a name he found convenient for the occasion . " Please have a seat . " I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stepped forward . Nothing on the desk but a simple gooseneck lamp , which was not turned on . Not even plugged in , I saw . The bookshelf had only a few dusty volumes , the chalkboard had never been used . I could not see any cameras . I parked on the hard wooden chair in front of the desk . Cain 's battered office chair squeaked loudly as he sat also . <p> He picked up a piece of paper and pretended to read it for a moment . " Why did you use the stairs when you came up here ? " <p> Not the way I expected the interview to start . " I like to stay in shape , " I said . I did not mention that as I approached the elevator there had been two men I did not like the look of . I was in a nice office building , not the sort of place you would expect trouble , but an elevator is no place to discover that you have been too trusting of your fellow man . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this floor would be locked on the stairwell side ? " <p> " Most are , these days , but I worked making deliveries for a while . If you knock , generally someone will open the door for you . " <p> " And if no one did ? " <p> I decided to take a chance . Either they wanted me for my skills , or I did n't belong . " That was not a challenging lock . " <p> Cain nodded with satisfaction . " The men at the elevator were in my employ . What would you have done if I 'd had men on the stairs as well ? " <p> " Gone home . " <p> " You would give up so easily ? " <p> " You have to weigh the objective against the risk . " <p> " You find this objective to be that unimportant ? " <p> " Hell , it 's a job , right ? Not even a job , an interview . I 've got no problem with risk , but not just for a shot at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a risk for ? " <p> " For my country , for my mission , for the people reporting to me , and for the people I report to . In that order . " <p> " You 've thought about that before . " <p> " Yes . " <p> " You missed the camera in the table leg , but you got the one in the receptionist 's barrette . That was good . What can you tell me about European market forces ? " <p> " I spent most of my time on Yet Another Article About The Price of Silver . " <p> " What is the receptionist 's name ? " <p> " Rachel . " There had been no indication of her name anywhere in the office , but I take care of my body , ears included . I had heard her name over the line when she answered her phone . <p> " How many toes do I have ? " <p> " If I had to guess , I 'd go with ten . " I hesitated and added , " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Is there anything important to you in your apartment ? " <p> " No . " <p> " All right then . There are a couple of formalities , and then I can give you a full briefing . " <p> " I have a question first . " <p> " I will answer if I can . " <p> " When did you decide to hire me ? " <p> Cain smiled , the deep creases casting shadows in his colorless face . " When you said ? have a question first . ' " <p> MEETING II <p> Other . What a simple name for them . Back then , I wondered what they called us . It had seemed important while we danced with knives at each other 's throats . Now it was only with effort that I could remember what we had called ourselves . Special Defense Force . A meaningless name made even less significant when reduced to initials : SDF . By the end of our little war only the initials made any sense at all ; none of the words in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force , not defensive , and most certainly not special . <p> Smith 's wine arrived ; he sipped it tentatively and nodded . " The benefits of civilization , " he said , setting down his glass . <p> " Why are you here ? " I asked . <p> " You do n't remember ? To enslave your race . " He chuckled and shook his head sadly . <p> " Not that . How did you find me ? " <p> " You found me . " <p> I shot the Other a skeptical glance . " I was just sitting here . " <p> " They say that there are certain places in the world where , if you stay still long enough , you will see everyone . You taught us that much of hunting is remaining still , Mr. Nash , and you have been staying still a very long time . " <p> " I 'm just too tired to move . " <p> Smith sighed . " Yes . I am weary also . Enslaving your race will have to wait for another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say , dispense with the formalities . In this case Cain 's " formalities " were intrusive and uncomfortable , as they searched for any physical weakness or dependency that would undermine my ability to perform . The physical probing was followed by a series of tests and interviews designed to find similar flaws in my mind . I put up with the transparent questions , and even managed not to tell the practitioners what I really thought of them . Everything you need to know about my head is in my record . Efficient . Skilled . Not a team player . <p> These shrinks are the same guys who were sticking leeches on people to cure their diseases only two hundred years ago . They do n't understand the brain , so they have invented a " mind " that lives inside it , like the bad humors in one 's blood that caused disease . A decent carnival fortune teller could do better than these guys . It 's too bad , in retrospect , that they did n't hire one . But that would n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other end of this series of indignities intact and employed . That evening I was on a plane , bound for Colorado , and all I knew was that I did not work for the FBI . I had not received the promised debriefing . More runaround . I 'll admit it , though , I was curious and not just a little proud that I was to be part of something so secret and elite . <p> I flipped through the newspaper Cain had given me . " Most of it is rubbish , " he had said . " But mixed in with the rubbish are things that only look like rubbish , but are in fact important pieces of information disguised as rubbish . Look for larger patterns , things not said as well as what is said . Those are the things we will use to track the enemy . " <p> " That seems pretty subjective . " <p> " For the inexperienced , it is . Once you have had training and practice , you will see their motions clearly . These are the clues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sorts of clues you must do your best not to leave about your own movements . You will not communicate with your team in any conventional manner ; the enemy will intercept and decipher anything we have the technology to send . " <p> " Who are they ? Israelis ? Japanese ? The Russians ca n't match our stuff . " <p> " You will learn more when you are in a more secure place . Good-bye , Mr. Nash . It is likely we will not meet again until the battle is concluded . " He was wrong about that , of course . <p> MEETING III <p> The rain started falling harder . People rushed past , huddled under umbrellas , eyes cast downward . " Things have changed since you first got here , " I said . <p> " Yes . You still have the power of self-extinction , but you have forgotten the fear . Rather , your fear has been diverted to smaller things . " <p> ILLUMINATION <p> There comes a time in any story when the truth is revealed . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . <p> Commander Hightower was watching my eyes intently . " Skeptic " was probably in my record somewhere , and he knew damn good and well that I was not going to swallow any kind of little-green-men malarkey . I was disappointed . The training had been the most intense - and the most fun - I had ever recieved , and I could feel my skills increase every day , every hour . There was little they could teach me about combat ; in fact , I was often teaching others those skills . However , that was only a small part of the curriculum and in many ways the least important . <p> We learned how to get where we did n't belong . We learned computers - not computers like they have today , nothing close , but at the time we were on the cutting edge of what is now called " cracking . " Above all , we learned to analyze a cloud of data and find the one relevant fact . Needles in haystacks became child 's play for us . <p> We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Otis , Roger , Darryl , and me . No last names . Otis in particular could skim over a pile of information and come up with the unexpected . As time went on , he grew pensive . <p> " What 's up ? " I asked him one afternoon as we were walking to the mess hall . <p> " Something 's wrong , " he said . " There 's a hole . " <p> Now that he mentioned it , I knew just what he meant . " Our objective . " <p> " Search and destroy , certainly , but who is the enemy ? " <p> " And why have we not been taught anything about recent technology ? " I agreed . " I 've heard about some pretty amazing stuff . " <p> Perhaps it was the question planted by Otis , but I hesitated before I dismissed what Hightower told me . We had been taught to assimilate disparate information and draw conclusions , and to trust our instincts . Now I stood , and knew why Otis had been so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little green men were here , and I was supposed to stop them . <p> Hightower relaxed . " That went better than I expected , " he said . <p> " I should have figured it out already . " <p> " It 's a big jump . " <p> " Otis got it , did n't he ? " <p> " That guy spooks me . I think he can see about five minutes into the future . " We shared a chuckle of admiration , then the commander spoke again . " Right now he is our most valuable asset . You 'll be watching his back , and when he digs something up , you 'll act on it . " <p> " What if I ca n't do both ? " <p> " That will be entirely your call . You once said you were loyal to country , mission , subordinates , and superiors , in that order , and you have demonstrated that you understand that all are intertwined . You can weigh relative risks against the larger objective . That is why you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks ? " <p> " Ah , no . " <p> " I 'll do my best , sir . " <p> Hightower put his hand on my shoulder . " I know you will . " It felt like good-bye . <p> And off I went to fight the Others , Otis at my side . <p> SUSPICION <p> " Someone 's selling us out , " Otis said , reading the report of Darryl 's death . Our comrades were falling one by one . " Darryl was almost as paranoid as you are . " <p> " Maybe he was on a hunt . " That was the time of greatest risk , when an agent would have to move , creating ripples the Others could use to track him . <p> " Maybe . " Otis did n't sound convinced . <p> MEETING IV <p> The little finger of each of Smith 's gloves was curled inward somewhat and did not move . There was no finger inside . They had convincing prosthetics , but obviously Smith did n't feel the need to bother anymore . Eight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red . To them , we all bled black . <p> " We knew , when we came here , that there would be no going back . It will be many years , yet , before those back home learn what became of us , that proud group of colonists , carrying the beacon of civilization to another backward race . " <p> I had another coffee , Smith another wine . " It does n't affect me as much as it does you , " he said , " but it still produces a pleasant sensation . " <p> " Do you have wine , where you come from ? " <p> " No . We have something much like yeast , so we have alcohol . " He smiled . " I do n't think intelligent life could exist without it . But we do n't have wine . " He swirled the deep red liquid in his glass , looking through it at the gray street beyond , the bloody image reversed . I wondered what he saw . He smiled wistfully . " It makes living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He finished his wine quickly and had another . " I 'm glad you found me , " he said . " There 's no one else on this planet who understands . We are warriors , but we shall not have the honor to fall to a worthy adversary . We will simply be forgotten , soldiers in a war that never happened . " <p> KNOWLEDGE <p> " Uh , oh , " Otis whispered . Something in his voice caused the hair on the back of my neck to stand up . I looked up from cleaning my Browning ; he was staring woodenly ahead , his face gray , the newspaper in front of him forgotten . <p> " What is it ? " I asked . <p> I do n't think he heard me . He put his hands up to his eyes and slumped forward , letting out his breath heavily . " Oh , man , oh , man , " he moaned . " Shoulda seen it sooner . " <p> " What ? " <p> He looked at me with haunted eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had ? " <p> As usual , when Otis said it , it became obvious . Cain was one of them . I saw the future then , just for a moment . The life of our boss would not come without cost . It was up to me to determine whose life would be given in exchange . <p> Otis was beyond competent , he was far more dangerous than almost anyone on the planet . I was more dangerous yet , but we each had a back . Two people working together are four times as deadly as one man alone . I did n't want to bring Otis , but Cain was one of them , and Cain knew everything . " Sounds like we have a job to do , " I said . <p> Otis took a deep breath . " Yeah . Else we 're screwed . " <p> " We 're probably screwed anyway . " <p> " Sucks to be us , I guess . I 'll cover you . " <p> " Otis . We have to do this , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first priority is to get Cain . The second priority is to get you out safe . " <p> He looked at me , angry . " Up yours , man . We 're partners . " <p> MEETING V <p> Smith rocked back , leaning on the windowsill behind him . " I have sent my final report , " he said . <p> I took a sip of coffee to cover my silence . <p> " All it said was , ' Good-bye . ' " <p> " And then you found me . " <p> " No , I sent it while we were talking . It will be many years before they receive it . " He stood . " Farewell , Mr. Nash . Thank you for the company . " He laid a generous amount of money on the table . " Please let me pay for your coffee . It is the least I can do , if today we can end our war . " He turned and slowly walked up the street . <p> I stood also , and felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there before . I knew even before I touched it that it was a pistol , probably a Walther , favored by fames Bond and alien invaders alike . Light , compact , and very effective at short range . I left the money where it was and walked up the street in the direction Smith had gone . <p> IMG
