THE GAME BEGINS WITH THE LAND ON WHICH IT IS PLAYED . PLAY THESE COURSE AND YOU WILL UNDERSTAND WHERE THE GAME COMES FROM , WHERE IT HAS BEEN , AND WHERE IT IS GOING . AND , OH , YEAH , ONE OF , THEM IS NOT IN THE UNITED STATES . Photograph Walker Travis , who helped import golf to America . // 1 . THE OLD COURSE , St. Andrews , Scotland . Three hundred years older than Old Tom Morris , the Old Course is the fountainhead of the game . The seminal American designers began there : Donald Ross was an apprentice in William Forgan 's club-making shop . Charles Blair Macdonald and A. W Tillinghast learned the game while attending St. Andrews University Alister MacKenzie mapped the Old Course , and a copy of his map hung prominently in Bob Jones 's office . And Jack Nicklaus won two of his greatest victories here , in the British Opens of 1970 and 1978 . Every great golf course 's design goes back to the timeless strategies of St. Andrews . 0 2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York . Devereux Emmet and Walter Travis , 1899 . A flattish landscape punctuated by deep pot bunkers in the best Scottish tradition . Its uniquely tilted greens are simply an extension of the fairways , but their challenge remains daunting through a hundred years of technology , and the reason is simple : It 's hard to get the ball close to the hole when you have to allow for a bounce-and that 's true whether you 're hitting a fairway wood or a wedge . 3 . OAKMONT COUNTRY CLUB , Oakmont , Pennsylvania . William and Henry Fownes , 1903 . A club that has relished its role as America 's toughest championship test of golf , most forcefully demonstrated in the U. S. Open of 1935 , when only Sam Parks broke 300 over four rounds . Its huge , fast greens are full of undulations the likes of which were not found in Scotland , and they created a new standard for America 's elite courses . 4 . NATIONAL - GOLF LINKS OF AMERICA , Southampton , New York . Charles Blair Macdonald , 1909 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal course to further the art of golf architecture in America-and it did just that , gaining worldwide acclaim as the first course outside Britain to rival the best links courses . Several holes are modeled after Macdonald 's favorite holes overseas . There are some unusual blind shots , but it 's a course loaded with imagination , strategy , and fun . 5 . MERION GOLF CLUB ( EAST COURSE ) , Ardmore , Pennsylvania . Hugh Wilson , 1911 . A brilliant design crammed into just 126 acres on Philadelphia 's Main Line . It was the scene not only of Ben Hogan 's stirring 1950 comeback U. S. Open victory but also of Bobby Jones 's clinching of the Grand Slam in 1930 . The quarry that dominates the finishing holes is justly famous , but it was Wilson 's " white faced " bunkers , rising out of the fairway to be visible from the tee , that were adopted by his pupil William Flynn and by other Philadelphia architects such as Tillinghast , George Thomas , and George and Tom Fazio , and that became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , PebbleBeach , California . Jack Neville and Douglas Grant , 1949 , with revisions by Herbert Fowler H. Chandler Egan , and jack Nicklaus . The famed California-coast resort is an American icon , and it invented the luxury golf destination resort . The nine holes along the Pacific make it famous , thanks to developer Samuel Morse 's foresight in reserving the coastal property for open space and setting the homes back across a fairway . But for the pros and the amateurs in AT &T's; annual clambake , it was ( and still is ) the small , tilted greens that make the course an enduring challenge . 7 . PINE VALLEY GOLF CLUB , Clementon , New Jersey . George Crump , 1912-22 . Half an hour outside Philadelphia , this epic course is laid out with island fairways surrounded by the sandy wastes of the Pine Barrens . Architects of the day recognized that its bold and difficult design could not be the norm , but modern designers have envied its grand scale , the isolation of each hole-and its reputation as America 's best course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York . East and West Courses bV A. W Tillinghast , 1923 . The epitome of the northeastern parkland course , with thirtysix holes of small , well-guarded , undulating greens , which the architect compared to human faces : " Of course , there are many greens on other courses which are no more impresssive than the vacant , cow-like expression of some people , " Tillinghast wrote , " but then again there are some with rugged profiles which loom head and shoulders above the common herd . " The woods from which the course was cut made such a dramatic impression that other famous courses routed across farm fields were planted with hundreds of trees to resemble it . 9 . CYPRESS POINT CLUB , Pebble Beach , California . Alister MacKenzie , 1928 . The most dramatic meeting of land and sea in golf . MacKenzie was the first to insist that a great golf course should be a beautiful one , and there is no more forceful example of his theory . There are fewer holes along the cliffs than at neighbor Pebble Beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful contrast of scenery , and then the course works its way across the dunes , building toward a climax at the rocky sixteenth and seventeenth holes on the point itself . 10 . AUGUSTA NATIONAL GOLF CLUB , Augusta , Georgia . Alister MacKenzie and Bobby jones , 19.33 . As host to the annual Masters Tournament , Jones 's monument to golf has been the scene of more dramatic moments than any other championship course , yet the club is constantly tweaking the design to ensure that it continues to challenge the world 's best players . One thing it has n't changed is the severely undulating greens , which are so hard to approach that Jones and MacKenzie decided that no rough was necessary . If you 're out of position on the fairway , it takes a miraculous shot to get close to the hole . In recent years , the beautiful green fairways that television beams us from Augusta the first week of April have set an impossible standard for golfcourse superintendents across the country . 11 . PINEHURST COUNTRY CLUB NO. 2 COURSE . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 35 . Pinehurst was America 's first multicourse golf resort , but No. 2 was not designed as an ego booster . Its convex greens and tightly mowed chipping areas require more imaginative short-game play than any course before or since . Not even Ross built similar chipping areas on other courses in his day , but many modern architects have imitated them on the basis of Pinehurst 's success . 12 . THE DUNES GOLF &; BEACH CLUB , Myrtle Beach , South Carolina . Robert Trent ones , 1948 . The Dunes was only the third golf course on the Grand Strand , and today there are more than a hundred , thanks largely to its success . The Cornell-educated Jones was the first architect to be schooled for the profession rather than jumping into it from another part of the golf business , and he drove the industry to new heights in the development-rich years after the Second World War . Robert Trent Jones became a household name " Give your course a signature , " he advertised , and soon no course could afford to be without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long par-5 thirteenth hole , a boomerang around the shores of Lake Singleton , ushered in water hazards as a major component of golf design and , indeed , the " signature hole " as a marketing concept . 13 . OAKLAND HILLS COUNTRY CLUB ( SOUTH COURSE ) , Birmingham , Michigan . Donald Ross , 1915 , with modifications by Robert Trent Jones , 1950 . Jones 's redesign of this Detroit classic was one of the most controversial moments in golf , making headlines when none of the professionals could break par-until Ben Hogan 's final-round 67 made both men heroes . Jones 's new concept included tight fairway bunkering that pinched the fairway 250 to 270 yards from the tee ( instead of the " carry bunkers " that had been the standard and were easily carried by the best players ) and greens that were designed with several distinct " pin placements " at the back and sides of each green . 14 . HARBOUR TOWN GOLF LINKS , Hilton Head , South Carolina . Pete Dye and Jack Nicklaus , 1969 . Dye 's short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seventytwo-hundred-yard championship courses then in vogue , but the annual Heritage Tournament validated the design with a who 's who of winners and put Dye at the forefront of the business . Golfers would never took at railroad ties the same way again . 15 . MUIRFIELD VILLAGE GOLF CLUB , Dublin , Ohio . Jack Nicklaus and Desmond Muirhead , 1974 . The Golden Bear 's answer to Bob Jones 's Augusta National became a springboard into the world of golf-course design for every Tour player to follow . But the perfect sight lines and immaculate conditioning of the course that Jack built became the standard for the industry . 16 . TPC AT SAW GRASS , Ponte Vedra , Florida . Pete Dye , 1980 . Built as the home course for the PGA Tour and the annual Tournament Players Championship , this controversial Dye design was immediately criticized for its difficulty , but it reinvented the golf course as theater . As a stage to test the skills and inner fortitude of the world 's best players in front of huge galleries , the course has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing side led many architects and developers to imitate the island-green seventeenth and the difficulty level that had made it newsworthy . 17 . SHADOW CREEK , Las Vegas . Tom Fazio and Steve Wynn , 1989 . The absence of great land for golf in the barren Nevada desert was no deterrent to Wynn , who had already created a volcano and a tropical forest for his hotels there . He chose Fazio to prove that the hand of man could indeed produce a course to rival the world 's best-as long as there was enough money to spend on landscaping it convincingly . Thirtyseven million dollars later , so they say , Shadow Creek was indeed a North Carolina mountain oasis rising out of the desert and , like Pine Valley and Augusta , set a standard that everyone wanted to emulate but no one could afford to . The course ushered in the age of multimillion-dollar private playgrounds ( see Man at His Best , page 36 ) that flaunted the wealth of the end of the century and cemented Fazio 's reputation as the designer of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLUB , Mullen , Nebraska . Bill Coore and Ben Crenshaw , 1995 . The dead opposite of Shadow Creek , Sand Hills is laid into the most perfect dunescape in America , with wind-eroded bunkers begun by nature and even natural green contours on several of the holes . In an age of lavish creations , its smashing success has been a timely reminder that great golf holes derive from interesting terrain , encouraging several young architects to form an alternative " minimalist " school of design . Perhaps more important , its low cost of construction allowed it to be a success despite its remote location , and it encouraged other developments in far-flung places , fields of dreams for golfers of the new century to seek out and enjoy . is FOR MORE COURSES YOU SHOULD PLAY , VISIT ESQUIREMAG.COM/GOLF Photograph Above : The thirteenth hole at Pebble Beach , as seen in 1929 .
