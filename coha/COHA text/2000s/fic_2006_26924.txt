Glossy Shetland ponies crowded together in the late afternoon shade of cottonwood trees . Standing head to tail , they whisked breezes over each other 's faces as if nothing were wrong . For them , nothing was , but Samantha Forster was worried . How could something she 'd wished for bring bad luck to the wild horses she loved ? The early September sun sizzled against Sam 's back . Summer had n't ended just because it was the first day of school . She glanced toward the mansion sitting atop the man-made hill overlooking Gold Dust Ranch . The oversized house was air-conditioned and after the long walk from the school bus stop to visit her best friend , that refrigerated air would feel wonderful . But her best friend lived in the foreman 's house , not the mansion . Sam knew she was more likely to receive an invitation from the ponies , to share their irrigated emerald pasture , than one into Linc Slocum 's giant pillared house . She 'd worn a knit shirt Gram had called adobe red , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepmother , had ganged up on her until she 'd accepted their claim that she only had one chance to make a good impression on her teachers during this first week of school . But the shirt was too warm for the sunnyafternoon , especially when she was carrying two sets of books . Fretting over the temperature made a nice change from replaying last night 's phone call . Forget about the heat and the phone call , Sam told herself as she knocked at the front door of the small foreman 's house near Gold Dust Ranch 's front gates . But she could n't . At first she 'd been so excited . Pam O'Malley , her best friend from San Francisco , was coming to Nevada . Right this minute , Pam and her mom should be driving their camper from the city to Lost Canyon . Sam was excited to see Pam again and she could n't wait for her old best friend to meet her new one , but then Pam had announced the reason for their trip . " My mom has a grant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Pam had explained . " She 's going to investigate the wild horses around your area , and focus on stories of some legendary stallion . " The only legendary stallion in northern Nevada was the Phantom . Sam knew that as well as she knew the mustang 's safety depended on staying hidden , not being put under a magnifying glass . Sam knocked a second time , then fluttered the neck of her shirt for coolness while she waited for Jennifer Kenworthy , her best friend in the entire world , to let her in out of the sun . Level-headed Jen would help her figure out what to do about Pam and her mother . Jen 's passion was complex mathematics , and she loved solving intricate problems of any kind . But Sam did n't have time to announce her news . " Stay out , " Jen said as soon as she saw Sam . She did n't sound angry , just firm as she slipped past the screen door to come outside . Jen 's white-blond braids were pinned haphazardly atop her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aside the day 's homework Sam carried with her . A week ago , an attack by a range bull had shattered one of Jen 's ribs . According to her parents , Jen was n't well enough yet to return to school , so Sam had brought her new books to her . With her torso still wrapped in bandages for protection , Jen stepped gingerly off the porch . Sam stepped back to let Jen ease past . " What 's up ? " Sam asked . " Nothing that 'll make you happy , " Jen said as she led the way across the silently baking ranch yard . Sam felt her worry double . As she left the stack of books and homework on the porch , she wondered if Jen 's parents had decided their daughter should go back to being homeschooled instead of attending Darton High . No , a silent voice wailed in Sam 's head , but she just crossed her fingers and hoped not . Since Jen 's accident , the idea had been under discussion . The last Sam had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disagreement . " C'm on , " Jen said , looking back over her shoulder . " I want you to look at something . " With a sigh of relief , Sam followed . You could n't look at a decision . As she fell into step beside her friend , Sam almost blurted out her worries over Pam , but she knew she should be considerate first . " How does your rib feel ? " Sam asked . " Like the broken ends of that bone are still grating together under my skin , " Jen grumbled . " And do n't get me started on wearing layers of protective bandages during a heat wave . " Then Jen gave a lopsided grin , probably so Sam would n't think she was whining . Sam shuddered . Heat and sweat she could tolerate , but she winced at her friend 's pain . When she opened her mouth to sympathize , Jen stopped her . " Talking about it is a waste of time . " " Right , " Sam said , then turned her head so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't smothered her take-charge attitude . " What are you going to show me ? " Sam asked . Despite everything , excitement bounced up in her when she noticed they were headed for Gold Dust Ranch 's modern barn . The barn meant horses . " No hints , " Jen muttered . " I want your honest assessment . Maybe Ryan and I are overreacting . " Sam took a deep breath . Telling Jen about Pam 's visit would have to wait . Ryan Slocum , whose father owned the Gold Dust Ranch , was new to Nevada , and he sometimes misunderstood the Western way of things . But Jen had been born on this ranch . If Sam added all Jen 's experience to the fact that she was a science and math whiz who insisted on a logical explanation for everything , the chances that Jen was overreacting were pretty small . Sam squinted and blinked as she passed from the glaring sunlight into the dim barn . Before her eyes accustomed themselves to the change , Jen shushed her .
