<p> Rosebud on Rush <p> *** <p> 720 N. Rush <p> ( 312 ) 266-6444 <p> 3-COURSE DINNER : about $34 before tax and tip <p> HOURS : 11 a.m. - 11 p.m . Monday-Thursday ; 11 a.m. - midnight Friday ; 11:30 a.m. - midnight Saturday ; noon-10 p.m . Sunday <p> WHEELS : valet ( $9 ) ; not wheelchair accessible ( stairs to get to either dining room ) <p> TRY : mixed grill of shrimp , calamari and octopus ; fried calamari ; chopped salad ; cavatelli al forno ; pollo Milanese ; pistachio gelato <p> TIPS : This is an upstairs/downstairs arrangement ( bar/smoking downstairs ) . The upstairs dining room is very pleasant and nicely appointed . Tablecloths and table candles add a nice look . Service is quite good . The white-jacketed waitstaff are there when you need them and not in your face otherwise . Keep in mind that portions are large , so plan to split and share , especially with the appetizers , salads and pasta dishes . Doing so will cut your tab considerably . Reservations suggested . The wine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love an Italian restaurant that lists meatballs and Italian sausage in a marinara sauce as a side dish . <p> IN A BITE : Still one of the most consistent Italian restaurants around . The menu sparkles with classic Italian dishes of great interest and wonderful flavor . Just as important , however , is the comfort level here along with the overall feeling that your patronage is very much appreciated . <p> Recently , a local magazine suggested that Italian food was not hot , as in no longer popular . Amazing ! Talk about being out of touch with reality . When the canals in Venice are paved over in concrete , I will bow to the possibility that Italian food is over the hill . <p> Right after I read the big news that Italian food was headed south , I had this incredible craving for a big bowl of pasta , so I made a beeline for Rosebud on Rush . Straight away , I ordered the rigatoni alla vodka . One bite of that incredibly delicious pasta , the silky marinara sauce lavished with the luxurious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well with cucina Italia . This was pure bliss in every bite . <p> And while I was at the restaurant , I took a good look around . It seems that nobody told those hundreds of people that I saw chowing down that Italian food was " out . " Then there were those hordes of eaters putting away pasta and all the rest at Carlucci in Rosemont . And the full house at Coco Pazzo Cafe on North St. Clair . And the full house at La Scarola on West Grand . And I do n't even want to get into what the wait was for pizza at Uno and Due . Sorry , magazine folks , but I am not buying the demise of Italian food . <p> Usually , I do two dinners at a restaurant before I write a review . I did two dinners AND a lunch at Rosebud on Rush . I did n't need to do the lunch ; I wanted to do the lunch . I make no bones about it : I love the way Rosebud does Italian food . Over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , I have enjoyed the food at Rosebud . It is no great revelation that the key to the success of any restaurant is consistency . And the way I eat it , consistency  --  the quality and goodness of the food month after month , year after year  --  is what separates the winners from the losers . Service may waver on occasion , an attitude here , a lack of understanding there , but in the end it is the food that makes the difference . <p> One more important point . Italian restaurants that last know who they are and who their core customers are . In other words , no surprises . The menu ( for the most part ) is written in stone . These are dishes that have proved their worth over the years , so why change ? Daily specials are , more or less , a token to the chef to spur his or her creative juices . <p> The grigliato is a good way to start at Rosebud . The large oval platter teems with the likes of shrimp , calamari @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grilled , is anointed with olive oil and sprinkled with red and yellow bell peppers . Nothing fancy , just straightaway good eating and plenty to go around , so plan on splitting the dish two or three ways . <p> Split the awesome portion of fried calamari , too . Well , maybe . This is , without a doubt , some of the best fried calamari in town , so you might want it all to yourself . Tender rings of golden baby squid are piled high on the platter , and these are so good they go down as easy as popcorn . <p> Splitting the chopped salad is practically a must . This salad overflows with shrimp ( three jumbo ) , chopped romaine lettuce , carrots , broccoli , tomatoes , onions , olives and garbanzos . A light herb vinaigrette is the dressing that drives the tastes home , and it is a smooth ride all the way . <p> Pasta dishes are classics to the core . Totally enjoyable is the cavatelli al forno . The cavatelli , small pasta " dumplings " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which gives them a tender , pleasing chew . The dumplings are then baked in a marinara sauce with a " blend of imported cheeses . " <p> One of the pasta specials one night was a lavish and lively combination of linguine in a garlic and olive oil sauce with asparagus ( as thin as reeds and perfectly cooked ) , artichoke hearts , sliced cherry tomatoes and three wonderful jumbo shrimp . <p> Despite orders from my doctor to watch the cream sauces , I just could not pass up the fusilli carbonara . What a fine dish of pasta this was . The perfectly al dente pasta , coated lavishly with a Parmesan cream sauce , mingled with chips of prosciutto , peas and mushrooms . This is a very rich pasta dish , and the idea of finishing the entire portion was beyond even my prodigious appetite , so half of it went home with me . <p> A number of seafood dishes on the menu come with pasta ( linguine with mussels or clams , a zuppa di mare with linguine ) , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ styled a bit differently , though still with an Italian flair . One evening it was a fine fillet of halibut that was dressed with a light sauce ( garlic with white wine reduction ) infused with fresh oregano . All was well with the accompanying vinegar peppers ( bell peppers ) , but the chunks of oven-roasted potatoes were dry and practically flavorless . <p> There are no fewer than six chicken creations to consider , but one that should not be missed is the pollo Milanese . Picture this : A large oval platter has " bookends " of pounded , lightly breaded and pan-fried chicken breasts that are tender from the pounding , but more important they are flavorful and incredibly delicious . Nesting between those fillets of chicken is a salad of arugula , fresh basil , tomato and onion that has been misted with a light vinaigrette . It does n't get much better than this . <p> Desserts move a bit beyond the usual Italian repertoire . Yes , there is a tiramisu , and this is one of the better versions around . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was tried . Not too bad . The brownie was more of a cake texture than the usual fudgy approach , but the chocolate sauce sluiced around the brownie was great and so was the rich vanilla ice cream . However , you might want to think light at meal 's end  --  considering all that goes before  --  and have the simple and cooling pistachio gelato . <p> Pat Bruno is a local free-lance writer , critic and author .
