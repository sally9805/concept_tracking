Wednesday , April 28 , 9 P.M. , Albert Einstein High School gymnasium " So Lana 's dad rented the sultan of Brunei 's ten-million-dollar yacht for the night , and had Lana and her friends driven out into international waters so they could drink without getting in trouble . " This is what Lilly just called to tell me . " Lilly , " I whispered . " You know you are n't supposed to call me on my cell phone . It is for emergency use only . " " You do n't think this is an emergency ? Mia , Lana 's dad renting the sultan of Brunei 's yacht like that ? That is a throwdown . He is basically telling your grandmother to bring it . " " I do n't have the slightest idea what you 're talking about . " Because I do n't . " And I have to go . I 'm at a PTA meeting , for crying out loud . " " Oh , God . " I can hear the soundtrack for Altar Boyz in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P. Reynolds-Abernathy the Fourth , she has gotten way into soundtracks from musicals , because J. P. 's dad is a theater producer , and J. P. can get free tickets to any Broadway show he wants , and all of the off-Broadway ones , too . And even the off-off-Broadway ones . " I forgot you had to go to that stupid thing . Sorry I 'm not there withyou . But . . . well , you know . " I did know . Lilly was serving the last week of a grounding her parents instituted after she was brought home by the NYPD for attacking Andy Milonakis  --  this kid from downtown whose cable access television show was picked up by MTV  --  with a Dojo 's side salad . Lilly believes Andy 's getting a basic cable deal instead of her is a travesty of justice , because her own local show , Lilly Tells It Like It Is , is so much better ( in her opinion ) , as it is n't simply entertaining , but also highlights facts she feels her viewers ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. 's decision to withhold $34 million from the United Nations Population Fund will lead to two million unwanted pregnancies , 800,000 induced abortions , 4,700 maternal deaths , and 77,000 infant and child deaths worldwide . Whereas a typical episode of Andy 's show features him holding a jar of peanut butter in one hand , a jar of salsa in the other , then making the jars dance with each other . Lilly is also peeved that Andy is deceiving the American public by allowing them to think he is just a kid , when we both saw him coming out of d.b.a. , which is a bar in the East Village that cards . So how did he get in there if he is n't at least twenty-one ? This is what she asked him when she saw him eating a falafel at Dojo 's Health Restaurant on St. Marks Place , and why she claims she was forced to hurl her side salad at him , drenching him in tahini dressing , and causing him to call the cops on her . Thankfully the Drs . Moscovitz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explaining that Lilly has been experiencing some anger issues since their recent separation . But that did n't stop them from grounding her . " So how 's the meeting going ? " Lilly asked . " Have they gotten to the you-know-what part yet ? " " I would n't know , because I 'm too distracted , talking to YOU , " I whispered . I had to whisper , because I was sitting in a folding chair in the middle of a row of very uptight-looking parents . Being New Yorkers , they were all , of course , very well dressed , with Prada accessories . But being New Yorkers , they were also all angry about the fact that someone was using a cell phone while someone else  --  namely , Principal Gupta  --  was up at the podium , speaking . Also , of course , that Principal Gupta was basically saying she could n't guarantee that their kids would get into Yale or Harvard , which was making them madder than anything . At $25,000 a year  --  which is how much tuition at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their investment . " Well , I 'll let you go now , so you can get back to work , " Lilly said . " But just FYI : Lana 's dad had her flown in to the yacht on the sultan 's helicopter , so she could make a spectacular entrance . " " I hope one of the blades cut her head off as she was getting out of it because she forgot to duck , " I whispered , avoiding the glare of the lady in front of me , who had turned in her seat to give me a dirty look for talking while Principal Gupta was giving everyone some very important information about the percentage of AEHS graduates who get into Ivy League colleges . " Well , " Lilly said . " No , that did n't happen . But I heard her Azzedine Alaia skirt flew up over her head and everyone saw that she was wearing a thong . " " Good-bye , Lilly , " I said . " I 'm just telling you . Turning sixteen is a big deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by having one of your stupid loft parties with the Cheetos and Mr. G as a DJ . " " Good-bye , Lilly . " I hung up just as the lady in the seat in front of me turned around to hiss , " Would you please put away that  --  " But she never got to finish , because Lars , who was sitting next to me , casually opened his suit jacket , revealing his sidearm . He was only reaching for a Listerine PocketPak , but the sight of his Glock 9 caused the lady 's eyes to widen . She closed her mouth and turned back around in her seat very quickly . Having an armed bodyguard follow you around everywhere you go can be a total pain in the butt , particularly when it comes to finding private time with your boyfriend . But there are moments , like that one , when it can actually rock . Then Principal Gupta asked if there was any outstanding business , and I threw my arm into the air . Principal Gupta saw me raise my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
