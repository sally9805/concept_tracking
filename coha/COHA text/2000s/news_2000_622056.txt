<p> TIGER WOODS has a virtual gallery . He 's not around , but they go through the motions , anyway . They cheer , they groan , they show the proper reverence . And then they go buy a hot dog or something , because the virtual man has passed . <p> This was a scene about 500 yards from the first fairway yesterday , along the busy thoroughfare that borders the main merchandise/concession area at Pebble Beach . It 's a recreational area , mostly , for people shopping or eating or heading off to someplace else . As an enormous television screen flashed images of brilliance yesterday  --  Els teeing off , O'Meara on approach , Mickelson out of the rough  --  people cast fleeting glances as they continued walking . <p> And then came an image of Tiger , lining up a birdie putt . All of a sudden , everything stopped . Nobody moved . " Down in front , " someone murmured from the grassy hillside . There was silence . Tiger missed the putt . There was a loud " Ohhhh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was business as usual . <p> That 's a pretty good illustration of Woods ' command of the U.S. Open and the sport in general . Do n't be surprised if you 're watching at home and a red-clad course marshal walks into your living room and raises his arms , signaling that Tiger is about to hit . Because of him , golf spans every continent and the general public is riveted to the screen . Without him , it 's a bunch of guys in Wal-Mart hats . <p> Beware of some off-color moments in the following account , for it chronicles a trip into Tiger 's world . It 's a world where nobody minds a tawdry remark and where sex appeal is absolutely a front-burner issue . This , after all , is why Tiger rules the landscape . Forget the mechanics of his game ; after a while , even the leaderboard does n't matter . People ca n't take their eyes off him , and if we learned anything , it 's this : Tiger is just as interesting  --  and so is the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tournament . <p> " The leaderboard should say Woods , Nicklaus , Hogan ' , " said a twentyish New Yorker named Skye Luque . " That 's who he 's competing against . Timeless records . Legends of the game . That 's why I 'm here . " <p> Would it be boring , though , if Tiger started winning every tournament in a runaway ? <p> " Hypothetical question , " he said , " because that 's not gon na happen . You always have to putt . They said he 'd rule the world after the ' 97 Masters , and he did n't win another major for two years . " <p> How about that foul language from Saturday 's first round ? Was n't that a little offensive ? <p> " Not at all , " said the man sitting alongside Luque , Carlo Summonte from New Jersey . " Makes him more human . If he smoked Kools out here , that would be even better . " <p> But do n't we need a foil for Tiger , an Andre Agassi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ? " Luque said . " You 'll have guys beating him  --  Sutton , Vijay Singh , maybe Duval . But one guy week after week ? No way . " <p> Alongside the first fairway , there was a man walking away from Tiger 's gallery . A bit weary of it all , perhaps ? <p> " Not at all , " said Fran Routh , a stockbroker from Fresno . " I 've been watching the best golfers in the world all day . I just stood up there and watched Tom Lehman hit a shot right toward me . Greatest thing in the world . " <p> But what about those people selling their tickets outside , apparently because of lack of interest ? <p> " If they 're doing that , " he said , " they 're not into golf . " <p> A fellow named Pete Mears , from San Mateo , was also heading in the opposite direction from TigerLand . " I miss hearing the roars , " he said . " I mean the really big ones , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way . It 's pretty quiet out here today . " <p> " Wait , there 's a roar , " said the man next to him , sarcastically . " Rocco Mediate for bird . " <p> " My whole game plan , " said 44-year-old Chester Green , " is the same one I had at Olympic Club ( for the ' 98 Open ) and any other big tournament : Be on the 18th green late in the day and watch it unfold . You can say you were there when Tiger just killed everybody . I 'd rather say I saw him duke it out with whoever on the final nine . Not that I 'm leaving , mind you . If this is the Tiger we get , then fine . " <p> Eventually we caught up to Tiger 's gallery . It 's a jungle out there , but the urge was just too great . A Seattle housewife named Becky Scott was glued to the scene . " I 'm really not concerned with the scores , " she said . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , because he 's so cute and personable . " <p> Not put off by the language at all ? <p> " Oh , no . I do n't blame him . Everybody does that . Otherwise , he would n't be normal . " <p> We inject here a relevant remark from Thomas Bonk , the L.A. Times writer : " The thing about Tiger is that everything he does is monitored . That thing ( the cussing incident ) happened around 8 a.m. yesterday morning . Do you think Nicklaus and Palmer were miked by television in the early morning on Saturday ? Tiger does n't have one private moment . " <p> Bonk , like most writers , has been captivated by the scene . Forget " parity " if you 're chronicling the great athletes of sport . Give writers a commanding , dominant figure every time . <p> " I 'm certainly not bored , " said Dave Anderson , the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer of the New York Times . " The great Ben Hogan years made it a better sport . The great Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Jordan kept hitting those last-second shots and winning titles ? Plus , there 's just something about Tiger and his golf game . I 'd be watching him if there was nobody else in the tournament . " <p> Down the line in Tiger 's gallery , there was a girl who looked to be about 16 or 17 . She seemed more than interested . She seemed to view Tiger as life itself . We ventured the inquiry as to what made him so special . <p> " Oh , my God , " she said , dreamily . " I mean , just look at him . I want him so bad . " <p> Moving on  --  and not a moment too soon  --  we headed up to a wall of corporate tents . Cocktails were flowing . Cell phones were ringing . Buyers were selling . We were looking for someone who took issue with Tiger 's profane outburst on Saturday , without much luck , until one person piped up : " Yeah , I got three kids . He kinda lost me there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " <p> Finally , there was a distinguished-looking group of fortyish types standing along the 14th fairway , well away from Woods ' location . They were locals , as it turned out . Lodge people . Members of nearby private courses . In lieu of actual names , which they preferred to protect , we 'll call them Ed , Mike , Tom and Mary . <p> Ed : " Who cares if it 's a great golf tournament ? We 're watching the new Nicklaus . A new chapter of history . " <p> Mary : " I just watched Notah Begay hit a ball 60 yards out of a terrible lie from the rough . If that was you , Ed , it goes 10 yards . Me , I 'd just call a cab . " <p> So , Tom , did the language bother you at all ? <p> " F  --  no. " ( laughter ) . Are you kidding ? Those are golf words . That was a scene from every round of golf I ever played . " <p> Ed : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out here who can really be a rival for this guy . " <p> Mike : " No , but watch all the kids who are inspired by him . They 're all hitting golf balls right now . In 10 years , there will be somebody that good . " <p> Mary : " I saw a little black kid the other day , maybe 2 1/2 years old , hitting three buckets of balls . Hit ' em just like a pro . " <p> Tom : " What nobody mentions is , if eight guys are in the hunt and you 're out here with a ticket , you do n't know where the hell to go . You always feel like you 're in the wrong place . I almost like it better this way . Less stress . I 'll probably live longer . " <p> Mary : " You hear this roar , and it 's like , Oh , no . ' It 's like being in the wrong line at the post office . " <p> Heading back to the press tent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or virtual kind , but the vacant brand . There were four of them , all fast asleep in the shade . Perhaps they were making a statement of some kind . It was a minority view .
