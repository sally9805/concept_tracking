Taking on a huge role in the new music industry , M players are looking and sounding great . // Talk about hype . Following the word " sex , " a search on the Internet finds that " WPB " is the second-most popular term in cyberspace . And it 's no wonder . These past months have brought a flood of headlines concerning M files on the Internet Unless you 've had your head under a rock , you 've likely heard of the meltdown of free M music file " sharing " services , namely a company called Napster . All this should come as no surprise . Big bucks are at stake for the music industry , and aside from the few artists who actually want to distribute their songs via free swapping on the Internet , much of the M music available belongs to a copyright holder , who probably is n't the one offering the file for free .

Right now , and in the production pipeline for this year , there are a host of next-generation M devices designed to enhance your listening enjoyment . With feature-laden portables , car players , digital audio receivers , PDAs and even MPa phones , it 's a jungle out there . Coming And Goings MPEG audio compression is n't new . Developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group in the late 1980s , this technology allows digital audio data signals to be shrunk to about a tenth of their original size without any significant loss in sound quality . In the mid-1990s , the ISO-MPEG1 Audio Layer-3 standard-now known as MP3-was developed . With this format , a typical 4-minute CD track can be compressed into a file about 4M B in size , compared to the 40MB that same file might be as a standard WAV file . When high-quality sound is n't critical ( such as in books-on-tape or other spoken-word content ) , compression factors of 24 or greater can be achieved while retaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handheld M players are by far the most mature and common M hardware . But , after sampling some of the latest players , we found that the manufacturers are still adding new tricks to these portables . One of the biggest evolutionary steps in M portables is the addition of features-both internal enhancements and external , plug-in accessories . While specific features vary from player to player , they all share a few things in common , including solid-state design ( meaning there are no moving parts inside ) and ever-increasing storage capacity . M portables rely on your personal computer to serve as a base station for organizing , storing and transferring music files . Each player comes with software and a cable ( USB is the standard ) for transferring the music-we found the procedures fairly simple on the players we tried out . If you still have n't figured out the rules for M , here 's the gist : As long as you own a CD and the M files you make from it are strictly for personal use , you 're safe . You can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Epitonic.com , Jazzpromo.com and Audible.com ( all of which have free samples as well as pay-to-use files ) . When you start swapping M files from your personal CDs with online " buddies , " you 're violating copyrights and asking for trouble . Intel Delivers A Winner Topping our charts in handheld portables is Intel 's Pocket Concert ( www.intel.com/home/audio ) , offering 128MB total memory at a list price of $299 . This 3.9 x 2.5 x 1-in. device weighs just over 4 ounces with two AAA batteries , has a builtin FM tuner ( with 10 presets ) and supports both M and Windows Media Audio ( WMA ) formats . Intel claims a battery life of up to 10 hours when playing digital audio , or as much as 16 hours of FM audio , although your in vidual mileage may vary .

A kit with these accessories plus additional batteries and cables is offered for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USB connection , we transferred 108.5MB of M files in just over 8 minutes . The player 's independent bass and treble adjustment , in addition to its volume control , was a nice plus . The " neckphones " sounded good while proving to be quite comfortable . The Pocket Concert can not accept added memory , but it does come with twice the basic storage of any other player we tried . Intel figures that most owners wo n't spend the cash to add more memory , so they put in enough to serve all but the most demanding user . The Pocket Concert is easy to use , with basic controls and a clever rotate/click wheel , similar to that found on a mouse , which allows you to select tunes and make other feature adjustments . Call It Cool Another of our M favorites is not just a portable player but doubles as a PCS phone ( " Musical Calling , " March 2001 , page 92 ) .

Rio Still Rocks It all began in 1998 with the first Rio from Diamond Multimedia , and the new Rio 800 ( www.riohome . com ) is a worthy contender among this breed of M portables . With 64MB standard for its storage , the 800 delivers stylish looks in a compact package similar in size and weight to the Pocket Concert ( the Rio is a bit bigger , but also a bit lighter ) . Coming in at $279.95 , the 800 loses ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and transferring files takes longer ( just over 6% minutes to copy 60MB of M files ) . The 800 also lacks the Pocket Concert 's FM tuner , but it does support both the M and WMA formats . One of the best attributes of the Rio is its great selection of available accessories . Need more memory ? Add 32 or 64MB , starting at $99.95 . How about a travel case ( $24.95 ) , car adapter ( $21.95 ) or colored faceplates ( $26.95 for a three-pack ) ?
