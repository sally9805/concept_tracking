1 The old man sat alone in the shadow of the Dragon 's Teeth and watched the coming darkness chase the daylight west . The day had been cool , unusually so for midsummer , and the night promised to be chill . Scattered clouds masked the sky , casting their silhouettes upon the earth , drifting in the manner of aimless beasts between moon and stars . A hush filled the emptiness left by the fading light like a voice waiting to speak . It was a hush that whispered of magic , the old man thought . A fire burned before him , small still , just the beginning of what was needed . After all , he would be gone for several hours . He studied the fire with a mixture of expectation and uneasiness before reaching down to add the larger chunks of deadwood that brought the flames up quickly . He poked at it with a stick , then stepped away , driven back by the heat . He stood at the edge of the light , caught between the fire and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither or both . His eyes glittered as he looked off into the distance . The peaks of the Dragon 's Teeth jutted skyward like bones the earth could not contain . There was a hush to the mountains , a secrecy that clung like mist on a frosty morning and hid all the dreams of the ages . The fire sparked sharply and the old man brushed at a stray bit of glowing ash that threatened to settle on him . He was just a bundle of sticks , loosely tied together , that might crumble into dust if a strong wind were to blow . Gray robes and a forest cloak hung on him as they would have on a scarecrow . His skin was leathery and brown and had shrunken close against his bones . White hair and beard wreathed his head , thin and fine , like wisps of gauze against the firelight . He was so wrinkled and hunched down that he looked to be a hundred years old . He was , in fact , almost a thousand . Strange , he thought suddenly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Races , even the Druidsgone . Strange that he should have outlasted them all . He shook his head . It was so long ago , so far back in time that it was a part of his life he only barely recognized . He had thought that part finished , gone forever . He had thought himself free . But he had never been that , he guessed . It was n't possible to be free of something that , at the very least , was responsible for the fact that he was still alive . How else , after all , save for the Druid Sleep , could he still be standing there ? He shivered against the descending night , darkness all about him now as the last of the sunlight slipped below the horizon . It was time . The dreams had told him it must be now , and he believed the dreams because he understood them . That , too , was a part of his old life that would not let him godreams , visions of worlds beyond worlds , of warnings and truths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stepped away from the fire and started up the narrow pathway into the rocks . Shadows closed about him , their touch chill . He walked for a long time , winding through narrow defiles , scrambling past massive boulders , angling along craggy drops and jagged splits in the rock . When he emerged again into the light , he stood within a shallow , rock-strewn valley dominated by a lake whose glassy surface reflected back at him with a harsh , greenish cast . The lake was the resting place for the shades of Druids come and gone . It was to the Hadeshorn that he had been summoned . " Might as well get on with it , " he growled softly . He walked slowly , cautiously downward into the valley , his steps uneasy , his heart pounding in his ears . He had been away a long time . The waters before him did not stir ; the shades lay sleeping . It was best that way , he thought . It was best that they not be disturbed . He reached the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a deep breath , the air rattling from his chest as he exhaled like dry leaves blown across stone . He fumbled at his waist for a pouch and loosened its drawstrings . Carefully he reached within and drew out a handful of black powder laced with silver sparkle . He hesitated , then threw it into the air over the lake . The powder exploded skyward with a strange light that brightened the air about him as if it were day again . There was no heat , only light . It shimmered and danced against the nighttime like a living thing . The old man watched , robes and forest cloak pulled close , eyes bright with the reflected glow . He rocked back and forth slightly and for a moment felt young again . Then a shadow appeared suddenly in the light , lifting out of it like a wraith , a black form that might have been something strayed from the darkness beyond . But the old man knew better . This was nothing strayed ; this was something called . The shadow tightened and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all in black , a tall and forbidding apparition that anyone who had ever seen before would have recognized at once . " So , Allanon , " the old man whispered . The hooded face tilted back so that the light revealed the dark , harsh features clearlythe angular bearded face , the long thin nose and mouth , the fierce brow that might have been cast of iron , the eyes beneath that seemed to look directly into the soul . The eyes found the old man and held him fast . I need you The voice was a whisper in the old man 's mind , a hiss of dissatisfaction and urgency . The shade communicated by using thoughts alone . The old man shrank back momentarily , wishing that the thing he had called would instead be gone . Then he recovered himself and stood firm before his fears . " I am no longer one of you ! " he snapped , his own eyes narrowing dangerously , forgetting that it was not necessary to speak aloud . " You can not command me ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . You are all that is left , the last that may be until my successor is found . Do you understand The old man laughed nervously . " Understand ? Ha ! Who understands better than me ? " A part of you will always be what once you would not have questioned . The magic stays within you . Always . Help me . I send the dreams and the Shannara children do not respond . Someone must go to them . Someone must make them see . You " Not me ! I have lived apart from the races for years now . I wish nothing more to do with their troubles ! " The old man straightened his stick form and frowned . " I shed myself of such nonsense long ago . " The shade seemed to rise and broaden suddenly before him , and he felt himself lifted free of the earth . He soared skyward , far into the night . He did not struggle , but held himself firm , though he could feel the other 's anger rushing through him like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound of bones grating . Watch The Four Lands appeared , spread out before him , a panorama of grasslands , mountains , hills , lakes , forests , and rivers , bright swatches of earth colored by sunlight . He caught his breath to see it so clearly and from so far up in the sky , even knowing that it was only a vision . But the sunlight began to fade almost at once , the color to wash . Darkness closed about , filled with dull gray mist and sulfurous ash that rose from burned-out craters . The land lost its character and became barren and lifeless . He felt himself drift closer , repulsed as he descended by the sights and smells of it . Humans wandered the devastation in packs , more animals than men . They rent and tore at each other ; they howled and shrieked . Dark shapes flitted among them , shadows that lacked substance yet had eyes of fire . The shadows moved through the humans , joining with them , becoming them , leaving them again . They moved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows were devouring the humans , he saw . The shadows were feeding on them . Watch The vision shifted . He saw himself then , a skeletal , ragged beggar facing a cauldron of strange white fire that bubbled and swirled and whispered his name . Vapors lifted from the cauldron and snaked their way down to where he stood , wrapping about him , caressing him as if he were their child . Shadows flitted all about , passing by at first , then entering him as if he were a hollow casing in which they might play as they chose . He could feel their touch ; he wanted to scream . Watch The vision shifted once more . There was a huge forest and in the middle of the forest a great mountain . Atop the mountain sat a castle , old and weathered , towers and parapets rising up against the dark of the land . Paranor , he thought ! It was Paranor come again ! He felt something bright and hopeful well up within him , and he wanted to shout his elation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shadows were already flitting close . The ancient fortress began to crack and crumble , stone and mortar giving way as if caught in a vise . The earth shuddered and screams lifted from the humans become animals . Fire erupted out of the earth , splitting apart the mountain on which Paranor sat and then the castle itself . Wailing filled the air , the sound of one bereft of the only hope that had remained to him . The old man recognized the wailing as his own . Then the images were gone . He stood again before the Hadeshorn , in the shadow of the Dragon 's Teeth , alone with the shade of Allanon . In spite of his resolve , he was shaking . The shade pointed at him . It will be as I have shown you if the dreams are ignored . It will be so if you fail to act . You must help . Go to themthe boy , the girl , and the Dark Uncle . Tell them the dreams are real . Tell them to come to me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ present cycle is complete . I will speak with them then The old man frowned and muttered and worried his lower lip . His fingers once more drew tight the drawstrings to the pouch , and he shoved it back into his belt . " I will do so because there is no one else ! " he said finally , spitting out the words in distaste . " But do not expect . . . ! " Only go to them . Nothing more is required . Nothing more will be asked . Go The shade of Allanon shimmered brightly and disappeared . The light faded , and the valley was empty again . The old man stood looking out over the still waters of the lake for a moment , then turned away . The fire he had left behind still burned on his return , but it was small now and frail-looking against the night . The old man stared absently at the flames , then hunkered down before them . He stirred at the ashes already forming and listened to the silence of his thoughts . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . They were the Shannara children , the ones who could save them all , the ones who could bring back the magic . He shook his grizzled head . How was he to convince them ? If they would not heed Allanon , what chance that they would heed him ? He saw again in his mind the frightening visions . He had best find a way to make them listen , he thought . Because , as he was fond of reminding himself , he knew something of visions , and there was a truth to these that even one such as he , one who had foresworn the Druids and their magic , could recognize . If the Shannara children failed to listen , these visions would come to pass .
