6:30 P.M. Wednesday , February 20 , 2002 One Year Later It seemed to Daniel Lowell that the taxi had senselessly pulled to a stop mid-block in the center of M Street in Georgetown , Washington D.C. , a busy four-lane thoroughfare . Daniel had never liked riding in taxis . It seemed the height of ridiculousness to trust one 's life to a total stranger who more often than not hailed from a distant Third World country and frequently was more interested in talking on his cell phone than paying attention to driving . Sitting in the middle of M Street in the darkness with rush-hour traffic whizzing by on both sides and the driver carrying on emotionally in an unknown language was a case in point . Daniel glanced over at Stephanie . She appeared relaxed and smiled at him in the half-light . She gripped his hand affectionately . It was only by leaning forward that Daniel could see there was a traffic light suspended from above to facilitate a rather awkward mid-block left-hand turn . Glancing at the other side of the street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxy brick building . " Is this the hotel ? " Daniel questioned . " If it is , it does n't look much like a hotel . " " Let 's hold our evaluation until we have a little more data , " Stephanie responded in a playful tone . The light changed and the taxi leapt forward like a racehorse out of the gate . The driver only had one hand on the steering wheel as he accelerated through the turn . Daniel steadied himself to keep from being thrown against the car door . After a big bounce over the junction of the street and the hotel 's driveway , and then another sharp left-hand turn beneath the hotel 's porte cochere , the driver braked hard enough to put significant tension on Daniel 's seat belt . A moment later , Daniel 's door was pulled open . " Welcome to the Four Seasons , " a liveried doorman said brightly . " Are you checking in ? " Leaving their luggage in the hands of the doorman , Daniel and Stephanie entered the hotel lobby and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of statuary fit for a modern art museum . The carpet was thick and luxurious . Smartly dressed people lounged in overstuffed velvet chairs . " How did you talk me into staying here ? " Daniel questioned rhetorically . " The outside might be plain , but the interior suggests this is going to be expensive . " Stephanie pulled Daniel to a halt . " Are you trying to suggest that you 've forgotten our conversation yesterday ? " " We had a lot of conversations yesterday , " Daniel muttered . He noticed the woman who had just walked by carrying a French poodle had a diamond engagement ring the size of a Ping-Pong ball . " You know what I 'm talking about ! " Stephanie proclaimed . She reached up and turned Daniel 's face toward her own . " We decided to make the best of this trip . We 're staying in this hotel for two nights , and we 're going to indulge ourselves and , I would hope , each other . " Catching Stephanie 's witty licentiousness , Daniel smiled in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Senator Butler 's Health Policy Subcommittee is not going to be a walk in the park , " Stephanie continued . " That 's a given . But in spite of what happens there , we 're going to at least take the memory of a nice experience back to Cambridge . " " Could n't we have had a nice experience at a slightly less extravagant hotel ? " " Not in my book , " Stephanie declared . " They have a health club , a masseuse , and top-rated room service , all of which we 're going to take advantage of . So start relaxing and unwinding . Besides , I 'll pickup the tab . " " Really ? " " Sure ! With the salary I 've been pulling down , I should give some back to the company . " " Oh , that 's a low blow ! " Daniel remarked playfully , while pretending to reel from a make-believe slap . " Look , " Stephanie said , " I know the company has n't been exactly able to pay our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see that this whole trip goes on the company charge card . If things go really badly tomorrow which they very well might , bankruptcy court can decide how much the Four Seasons will be paid for our indulgence . " Daniel 's smile erupted into a full laugh . " Stephanie , you never fail to amaze me ! " " You ai n't seen nothing yet , " Stephanie said with a smile . " The question is : Are you going to let your hair down or what ? Even in the taxi , I could tell you were wound up like a piano wire . " " That was because I was worried about whether we were going to get here in one piece , not how we were going to pay for it . " " Come on , big spender , " Stephanie said , urging Daniel forward . " Let 's get up to our suite . " " Suite ? " Daniel questioned , as he allowed himself to be dragged toward the registration desk . Stephanie had n't exaggerated . Their suite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Potomac River in the background . On the coffee table in the sitting room was a cooler chilling a bottle of champagne . Vases of freshly cut flowers graced the bureau in the bedroom and the expansive countertop in the generous-size marble bathroom . As soon as the bellman disappeared , Stephanie put her arms around Daniel . Her dark eyes stared up into his blue orbs . A slight smile played across her full lips . " I know you are under a lot of stress about tomorrow , " she began , " so how about letting me be the tour leader ? We both know that Senator Butler 's proposed legislation would effectively outlaw your patented and brilliant procedure . And that would mean a cancellation of the second-round financing for the company , with obviously disastrous consequences . With that said and understood , let 's forget about it for tonight . Can you do that ? " " I can try , " Daniel said , although he knew it would be impossible . Failure was one of his worst fears . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him a quick kiss before breaking away to attend to the champagne . " Here 's the schedule ! We have a glass of bubbly , then take refreshing showers . Following that , we have reservations at a nearby restaurant called Citronelle that I hear is fantastic . After a wonderful meal , we come back here and make mad , passionate love . What do you say ? " " I 'd be crazy to offer any resistance , " Daniel said , raising his hands in mock surrender . Stephanie and Daniel had been living together for more than two years and had developed a comfortable familiarity . They had noticed each other back in the mid-eighties , when Daniel had returned to academia and Stephanie was an undergraduate chemistry major at Harvard . Neither acted on their mutual attraction , since such liaisons were specifically frowned upon by university policy . Besides , neither had had the slightest notion that their feelings were reciprocal , at least not until Stephanie had completed her Ph.D . and had joined the junior faculty , giving them an opportunity to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientific expertise complemented each other . When Daniel left the university to found his company , it was natural that Stephanie would accompany him . " Not bad at all , " Stephanie said , after she drained her flute and put the glass down on the coffee table . " Now ! Let 's flip to see who gets the shower first . " " No need to flip a coin , " Daniel said , placing his empty glass next to Stephanie 's . " I concede . You first . While you shower , I 'll shave . " " You 've got a deal , " Stephanie said . Daniel did n't know if it was the champagne or Stephanie 's infectious buoyancy but he felt significantly less tense , although hardly less worried , as he lathered his face and began shaving . Having had only one glass , he suspected it was Stephanie . As she had implied , the morrow might bring disaster , a fear disturbingly reminiscent of Heinrich Wortheim 's prophecy the day he 'd discovered Daniel was moving back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such thoughts to dominate their visit , at least for that evening . He would try to follow Stephanie 's lead and enjoy himself . Looking beyond his lathered image in the mirror , Daniel could see Stephanie 's blurred figure through the misted glass-enclosed shower . Her singing voice could be heard over the roar of the water . She was thirty-six but looked more like twenty-six . As he had told her on more than one occasion , she 'd done very well in the genetic lottery . Her tall , curvaceous figure was slender and firm as if she worked out regularly even though she did n't , and her dark , olive skin was nearly blemish-free . A mat of thick , lustrous dark hair with matching midnight eyes completed the picture . The shower door opened , and Stephanie stepped out . She briskly dried her hair , totally unconcerned about her nakedness . For a moment , she bent over at the waist , allowing her hair to fall free as she frenetically rubbed it with the towel . Then she stood back upright , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redirecting its mane . When she switched to drying her back with a provocative wiggle of her hips , her line of sight happened to catch Daniel 's stare in the mirror . She stopped . " Hey ! " Stephanie exclaimed . " What are you looking at ? You 're supposed to be shaving . " Suddenly self-conscious , she wrapped herself in her towel as if it were a strapless minidress . Initially embarrassed about being caught as a voyeur , Daniel quickly regained his equanimity . He put down his razor and stepped over to Stephanie . He gripped her shoulders and stared into her liquid-onyx eyes . " I just could n't help but notice how sexy and absolutely alluring you look . " Stephanie tilted her head to the side to get a view of Daniel from a slightly different perspective . " Are you all right ? " Daniel laughed . " I 'm fine . " " Did you slip back to the sitting room and polish off that bottle of champagne ? " " I 'm being serious . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To say I 've been preoccupied would be putting it mildly . When I had the idea of founding the company , I had no idea that fund-raising was going to occupy one hundred and ten percent of my efforts . And now on top of it comes this political menace , threatening to destroy the whole operation . " " I understand , " Stephanie said . " Truly I do , and I have n't taken it personally . " " Has it really been months ? " " Trust me , " Stephanie said , nodding her head for emphasis . " I apologize , " Daniel said . " And to show my remorse , I 'd like to make a motion to change the evening 's schedule . I propose that we move up the lovemaking and put the dinner plans on hold . Do I hear a second ? " As Daniel tried to lean down to give Stephanie a playful kiss , she pushed his still-lathered face back with just the tip of her index finger on his nose . Her expression suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped the bit of lather from her finger onto his shoulder . " Parliamentary rules are not going to maneuver this lady out of a good dinner , " she remarked . " It took some effort to get those reservations , so the evening 's plans hold as previously voted on and passed . Now back to shaving ! " She gave him a spirited shove toward the sink , then stepped to the neighboring sink to dry her hair . " Kidding aside , " Daniel yelled over the sound of the hair dryer when he 'd finished shaving . " You do look fantastic . Sometimes I wonder what you see in an old man like me . " He patted his cheeks with aftershave lotion . " Fifty-two is hardly old , " Stephanie yelled back . " Particularly as active as you are . Actually , you 're pretty sexy yourself . " Daniel regarded himself in the mirror . He thought he did n't look too bad , although he was n't going to fool himself by imagining he was in any way sexy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was on the nerdy side of the equation of life , having grown up as a science prodigy since the sixth grade . Stephanie was just trying to be nice . He 'd always had a thin face , so at least there was no problem with developing jowls or even wrinkles , save for some mild crow 's feet at the corner of his eyes when he smiled . He 'd stayed active physically , although not so much over the previous several months , due to the time constraints of fund-raising . As a faculty member at Harvard , he 'd taken full advantage of the athletic facilities , using the squash and handball courts regularly , as well as the rowing opportunities on the Charles River . His only real appearance problem as he saw it was the retreating hairline at the upper corners of his forehead and the thinning area of his crown , plus the salt-and-pepper silvering of his otherwise brown hair along the sides of his head , but there was n't much he could do about all that . After both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coats , they left the hotel armed with simple directions to the restaurant obtained from the concierge . Arm in arm , they strolled several blocks west along M Street , passing a potpourri of art galleries , bookshops , and antiques stores . The night was crisp but not too cold , with a canopy of stars visible despite the city lights . The matre d ' at the restaurant led them to a table off to the side that afforded a degree of privacy in the busy establishment . They ordered food and a bottle of wine , and settled back for a romantic dinner . By the time the entrees had been served and they both had had fun remembering their mutual attraction prior to their ever having dated , they lapsed into a contented silence . Unfortunately Daniel broke it . " I probably should n't bring this up ... " Daniel began . " Then do n't , " Stephanie interjected , having an immediate inclination of where Daniel was heading . " But I should , " Daniel said . " In fact , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later . Several days ago , you said you were going to research our tormentor , Senator Ashley Butler , with the idea of possibly giving me some help for tomorrow 's hearing . I know you looked into it , but you did n't say anything . How come ? " " My recollection is that you agreed to forget about the hearing for tonight . " " I agreed to try to forget about the hearing , " Daniel corrected . " I have n't been totally successful . Did you not bring up what you learned because you did n't find anything helpful or what ? Help me here , and then we can put it all aside for the rest of the night . " Stephanie looked off for a few beats to organize her thoughts . " What do you want to know ? " Daniel let out a short , exasperated laugh . " You 're making this more difficult than it needs to be . To be truthful , I do n't know what I want to know , because I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not going to be easy . " " We already had that impression . " " He 's been in the senate since 1972 , and his seniority gives him significant clout . " " I 'd assumed as much , since he 's the chairman of the subcommittee , " Daniel said .
