Section : culture in context <p> The Matrix sequels are only the most recent in a long line of terrifying technology movies . Can they serve as a prophetic wake-up call to help us unplug from today 's mind-numbing infotainment ? <p> THE MEN IN BLACK SUNGLASSES ARE BACK THIS summer and fall in three blockbusters , packing enough apocalyptic mayhem to keep movie fans everywhere as happy as cocooning couch potatoes with a universal remote . In The Matrix ( both Reloaded and Revolutions ) and The Terminator ( Rise of the Machines ) humanity is pitted against technology in a merciless and mechanized Armageddon that raises the specter of unruly machines seizing control of the planet . <p> We 've seen this sci-fi nightmare of upstart cyborgs before . Thirty-five years ago a pre-Pentium HAL staged a murderous mutiny in Arthur Clarke and Stanley Kubrick 's 2001 . Twenty years ago Rutger Hauer and his band of replicants slew their masters in Philip Dick and Ridley Scott 's Blade Runner . And last year a mob of microcomputers ran amok in Michael Crichton 's nanotechnology thriller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old tale . In 1817 Mary Shelley invented science fiction with the story of a man-made creature that destroyed his inventor 's world . Ever since Frankenstein , tales and films of rebellious and murderous machines have tapped into our modern unease about the technology we fashion with such pride . The enduring popularity of Shelley 's novel ( in print for 186 years and made into dozens of films ) and of contemporary series like The Terminator and The Matrix reflects our own fears that the machines we create to make our lives easier will turn on us and destroy us . <p> In the second half of the 20th century nuclear energy and weaponry represented our most terrifying technology . For the first time in history we had invented something that could end human life on the planet , and our fear of this surfaced in films like Nevil Shute 's On the Beach , Kubrick 's Dr. Strangelove , Sidney Lumet 's Fail-Safe , and John Badham 's WarGames . <p> But nuclear weapons are n't our only monster machines . The computers and information systems that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of our modern conveniences can also turn on us , stripping us of our privacy and robbing us of our identities . In The Net and Enemy of the State Sandra Bullock and Will Smith are turned into non-persons by an all-seeing and all-knowing technology that makes George Orwell 's Big Brother look like Mr. Rogers . <p> Even our cars can be frightening . The same sleek machines that offered us the freedom and romance of the open road have brought us the nightmares of two-hour commutes in bumper-to-bumper traffic , road rage , smog , global warming , wars for oil , and the extinction of half the planet 's species . Stephen King tapped into these automotive terrors in Christine , transforming a teen 's beloved first car into a homicidal maniac . And in Maximum Overdrive King turned the 18-wheelers parked at the local truck stop into a school of sharks . <p> Movies about murderous cyborgs also explore the dangers of our becoming soulless machines . The robots in The Matrix and The Terminator are detached , cerebral creatures with a minimalist cool and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Star Trek 's Data , they 've got no heart . So they wreak apocalyptic mayhem without batting an eye  --  or shedding a tear . No doubt the folks at Enron and Arthur Andersen managed to instill the same heartless cool in their executives and accountants , and it seems pretty clear that Pentagon officials who dreamed up a futures market in terrorism were missing their emotion chip , as well . <p> BUT WHAT MAKES THE MATRIX SO PARTICULARLY INTERESTING is that it raises the specter of machines that subjugate us by putting us to sleep  --  of TVs , VCRs , DVDs , and video games that anesthetize us to the real drama of life by feeding us a steady diet of infotainment pablum . The villainous machines in The Matrix have enslaved humanity by plugging our species into a vast entertainment network , a virtual playground where people can escape and ignore the bitter reality of their oppression . <p> The Matrix 's attack on the plug-in drug of our entertainment sector is more subtle ( or timid ) than the frontal assault Ray Bradbury launched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leveled in Network . There are no firemen burning books or news anchors screaming from windows . Still , the problem is the same  --  an unconscious society duped and drugged by a mass media bent on keeping it content and distracted . And the solution is similar  --  pull the plug and become a critical reader and thinker . <p> Of course our situation is different . In The Matrix , Fahrenheit 451 , and George Orwell 's 1984 , the news and entertainment media distracting and anesthetizing the masses are a tyrant 's tools . But we live in the world 's greatest democracy and have a free press unparalleled by any other . <p> Still , we may have more in common with the passive and unconscious audiences in these sci-fi tales than we 'd like to think . Even without a malevolent conspiracy to oppress us with the narcotic of entertainment , there are signs we have gone to sleep at the remote and are ( as the title of Neil Postman 's 1985 book suggests ) amusing ourselves to death . <p> Our government has ignored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chorus of nations and churches , making us a rogue to our allies and friends . Our leaders treat global warming as if it is science fiction but repeat lies about weapons of mass destruction like they are gospel . Washington says the recession is over , but nobody 's seen the jobs come back . Our soldiers die hunting the relatives of Saddam Hussein , and no one seems to wonder about Osama bin Laden . <p> And what do we learn when we turn on our TVs ? Network news offers only the most tepid criticism of our policies , and the cable stations wave flags in our faces . Our reporters are embedded or enthralled . And the rest of our programming has given itself over to an absurdist collection of " reality " shows that make the two-headed child and bearded lady of the roadside carnival seem positively ordinary . <p> While our soldiers die in Iraq , and our government fiddles with plans to invade Iran but not rescue Liberia , we are treated to shows about men and women lying and cheating their way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about straights pretending to be gay , series about couples trying to seduce other people 's partners . No wonder the Pentagon thought we would be interested in a game show where the contestants bet on assassination dates . <p> UNLIKE OTHER SCI-FI TALES ABOUT mutinous machines , The Matrix offers us an opportunity to think about the danger of using technology to escape the hard work of being human , to escape into an unreal world where we no longer have to acknowledge and confront evil or injustice . The ultimate threat in The Matrix is not the power of weapons or bombs that could be unleashed against an unsuspecting population . Nor is it the danger of computers running amok and seizing control . The real threat is that a society will use its technology to put itself to sleep , that we will distract ourselves from the reality around us by inventing a dream world that makes us feel good about ourselves . <p> In The Matrix Thomas Anderson/Neo ( Keanu Reeves ) must make a choice . Does he want to know the truth about his reality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ignorance ? Morpheus ( Laurence Fishburne ) warns Neo that while the truth will set him free , it will also cost him dearly . <p> We face a similar choice . Will we as a society continue to use our news and entertainment media to help us maintain a dreamlike state in which everything we do is good and all evil is in the hearts of our enemies ? Or will we unplug ourselves in a way that allows us to wake up to and confront the reality around us ? <p> Maybe it 's time for us to put down our remotes , get up from our couches , and walk out into the world . There 's a reality show out there we wo n't get on TV . <p> By Patrick McCormick <p> <p> PATRICK MCCORMICK , a professor of Christian ethics at Gonzaga University in Spokane , Washington . <p> McCORMICK 'S QUICK TAKES ON TECHNOLOGY THRILLERS <p> Fahrenheit 451 ( Universal Pictures , 1966 ) . The title of this Francois Truffaut and Ray Bradbury film refers to the temperature at which paper ignites , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one thinks for themselves , firemen like Guy Montag ( Oskar Werner ) burn books to protect a TV-watching citizenry from disturbing ideas . <p> But when a woman ( Julie Christie ) who does n't spend her days glued to the shopping channel convinces a curious Montag to sample the dangerous pleasures of literature and discover why so many rebels are willing to unplug their state-run TVs , new worlds begin to open , and the hunter soon finds himself among the hunted . 3 1/2 stars <p> Network ( MGM , 1976 ) . Nearly three decades after its release , Sidney Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky 's Oscar-winning black comedy about TV seems like a nightmare come true . <p> Television news director Max Schureacher ( William Holden ) learns that corporate bigwigs at the multinational behemoth that 's swallowed his struggling network have put entertainment executive Diana Christensen Faye Dunaway ) in charge of his division , and when an alcoholic anchor ( Peter Finch ) goes on-air with a suicidal rant , Christensen and the board decide these antics are good for the corporate bottom line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's fit to profit . " 4 stars <p> Blade Runner ( Warner Bros , 1982 ) . Rick Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) is a " blade runner " in Ridley Scott 's neo-noir sci-fi tale about a hard-bitten cop who hunts ' human replicants in the not-so-distant future . <p> Forced back into service to hunt down a gang of escaped cyborgs led by Roy Batty ( Rutger Hauer ) , Deckard must face his own growing discomfort about humanity 's cruel use and oppression of these not-so-inhuman creatures . What , Deckard wonders , makes us human ? And what allows us to treat others so inhumanely ? <p> The problem becomes even more real for him when he starts to wonder if the woman he is falling in love with ( Sean Young ) is also a replicant. 3 1/2 stars <p> 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( MGM , 1968 ) . Before Lucas or Spielberg , Stanley Kubrick invented the modern sci-fi film and its heart-stopping special effects . <p> Even when it was just released , people knew that Kubrick 's almost metaphysical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and standard classic . <p> If hardly a person alive can remember the full plot to this movie , it still burned more images and questions into our hearts than any other modern film . <p> Not to be missed is humanity 's invention of itself with the discovery of the first weapon , and supercomputer HAL 's lip-reading surveillance of the human masters it is about to overthrow . But my favorite will always be HAL pleading for its cybernetic soul . 4 stars <p> PHOTOS ( COLOR ) <p>
