PANIC // America should go " not abroad in search of monsters to destroy . . . . She might become the dictatress of the world : she would be no longer the ruler of her own spirit . " - John Quincy Adams , An Address . . . Celebrating the Anniversary of Independence , at the City of Washington on the Fourth of July 1821 // If anyone in America should have been prepared to respond to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , it ought to have been Vice President Dick Cheney . For decades before the planes hit the Pentagon and World Trade Center , Cheney had been secretly practicing for doomsday . // During the 1980s , while serving as a Republican congressman from Wyoming and a rising power in the conservative leadership in Congress , Cheney secretly participated in one of the most highly classi ? ed , top-secret programs of the Reagan Administration , a simulation of survival scenarios designed to ensure the smooth continuity of the U.S. government in the event of all-out nuclear war with the Soviet Union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would disappear in the dead of the night . He left without explanation to his wife , Lynne Vincent Cheney , who was given merely a phone number where he could be reached in the event of emergency . Along with some four or ? ve dozen federal of ? cials , Cheney would pretend for several weeks to be chief of staff to a designated substitute " president , " bivouacked in some remote location in the United States . // As James Mann reveals in The Vulcans , his rich intellectual history of the neoconservative brain trust that has guided Bush foreign policy , the exercise tried to re-create some of the anticipated hardships of surviving a nuclear holocaust . Accommodations were Spartan and cuisine was barely adequate . Civilian communications systems were presumed destroyed . The challenge was to ensure civil order and control over the military in the event that the elected president and vice president , and much of the executive branch , were decimated . The Constitution , of course , spells out the line of succession . If the president and vice president are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the House , and next to the president pro tempore of the Senate . But in a secret executive order , President Reagan , who was deeply concerned about the Soviet threat , amended the process for speed and clarity . The secret order established a means of re-creating the executive branch without informing Congress that it had been sidestepped , or asking for legislation that would have made the new " continuity-of-government " plan legally legitimate . Cheney , a proponent of expansive presidential powers , was evidently unperturbed by this oversight. // Mann and others have suggested that these doomsday drills were a dress rehearsal for Cheney ? s calm , commanding performance on 9/11 . It was not the ? rst time he had stared into the abyss . One eyewitness , who kept a diary , said that inside the Presidential Emergency Operations Command , or PEOC , a hardened command center several hundred feet under the by-then-evacuated White House , Cheney never broke a sweat as he juggled orders to shoot down any additional incoming hijacked planes , coordinated efforts with other cabinet members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and resolved issues such as how to avoid charges of taking hostage two visiting foreign heads of state , from Australia and Lithuania , after all air traf ? c had been shut down . // Six weeks after the attacks on New York and Washington , the Bush Administration had successfully restored calm , reassured the ? nancial markets , and rallied the sympathies and support of much of the world . But once again the White House was plunged into a state of controlled panic . // On October 17 , 2001 , a white powder that had been sent through the U.S. mail to Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle ? s of ? ce in the Capitol was positively identi ? ed . Scienti ? c analysis showed it to be an unusually dif ? cult to obtain and lethally potent form of the deadly bacterial poison anthrax . This news followed less than ten days after the death in Florida of a victim in another mysterious anthrax attack . The anthrax spores in the letter to Daschle were so professionally re ? ned , the Central Intelligence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced terrorist organization , most probably Al Qaeda , as a sequel to the group ? s September 11 attacks . During a meeting of the White House ? s National Security Council that day , Cheney , who was sitting in for the President because Bush was traveling abroad , urged everyone to keep this in ? ammatory speculation secret . // At the time , no one , not even America ? s best-informed national security leaders , really knew anything for sure about what sorts of threats loomed , or from where . The only certainty shared by virtually the entire American intelligence community in the fall of 2001 was that a second wave of even more devastating terrorist attacks on America was imminent . In preparation , the CIA had compiled a list of likely targets ranging from movie studios-whose heads were warned by the Bush Administration to take precautions-to sports arenas and corporate headquarters . Topping the list was the White House . // The next day , the worst of these fears seemed realized . On October 18 , 2001 , an alarm in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasn ? t a simple ? re alarm triggered by the detection of smoke . It was a sensitive , specialized sensor , designed to alert anyone in the vicinity that the air they were breathing had been contaminated by potentially lethal radioactive , chemical , or biological agents . Everyone who had entered the Situation Room that day was believed to have been exposed , and that included Cheney . " They thought there had been a nerve attack , " a former administration of ? cial , who was sworn to secrecy about it , later con ? ded . " It was really , really scary . They thought that Cheney was already lethally infected . " Facing the possibility of his own death , the Vice President nonetheless calmly reported the emergency to the rest of the National Security Council . // Members of the National Security Council were all too well aware of the seriousness of the peril they were facing . At Cheney ? s urging , they had received a harrowing brie ? ng just a few weeks earlier about the possibility of biological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a war game called Dark Winter conducted in the summer before that simulated the effects of an outbreak of smallpox in America . After the September 11 attacks , Cheney ? s chief of staff , // I. Lewis " Scooter " Libby , screened a video of the Dark Winter exercise for Cheney , showing that the United States was virtually defenseless against smallpox or any other biological attack . Cheney in particular was so stricken by the potential for attack that he insisted that the rest of the National Security Council undergo a gruesome brie ? ng on it on September 20 , 2001 . When the White House sensor registered the presence of such poisons less than a month later , many , including Cheney , believed a nightmare was unfolding . " It was a really nerve-jangling time , " the former of ? cial said . // In time , the Situation Room alarm turned out to be false . But on October 22 , the Secret Service reported that it had found what it believed to be additional anthrax traces on an automated letter-opening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cheney had convinced the President to support a $1.6 billion **25;156;TOOLONG program . Cheney argued that every citizen in the country should be vaccinated against smallpox . // During the ten days after the Vice President ? s scare , threats of mortal attack were nonetheless so frequent , and so terrifying , that on October 29 Cheney quietly insisted upon absenting himself from the White House to what was described as " a secure , undisclosed location " - one of several Cold War  --  era nuclear-hardened subterranean bunkers built during the Truman and Eisenhower Administrations , the nearest of which were located hundreds of feet below bedrock in places such as Mount Weather , in Virginia ? s Blue Ridge Mountains , and along the Maryland-Pennsylvania border not far from Camp David . // In a subterranean bunker crammed with communications equipment and government-issue metal desks , Cheney and other rotating cabinet members took turns occupying what was archly referred to as " The Commander in Chief ? s Suite . " // Of ? cials who worked in the White House and other sensitive posts with access to raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is nearly impossible to exaggerate the sense of mortal and existential danger that dominated the thinking of the upper rungs of the Bush Administration during those months . // " They thought they were going to get hit again . They convinced themselves that they were facing a ticking time bomb , " recalled Roger Cressey , who then headed what was known as the Terrorist Threats Sub-Group of the National Security Council . // Counterterrorism experts knew that Al Qaeda ? s members had in the recent past made efforts to obtain nuclear and other horri ? c weapons of mass destruction in order to commit murder on an even greater scale . Unlike earlier enemies of America , they targeted innocent civilians and fought clandestinely with inhuman disregard for life . Other foes had been better organized and more powerful , but none had struck as great a blow behind the lines in America , nor spread a greater sense of vulnerability in the population . Under the circumstances , Cressey admitted , " I ? rmly expected to get hit again too . It seemed highly probable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was understandable , but it was intensi ? ed by what was supposed to be a valuable new intelligence tool introduced after September 11 , what came to be known as the " Top Secret Codeword/Threat Matrix . " Having underestimated Al Qaeda before the attacks , Bush and Cheney took aggressive steps to ensure that they would never get similarly blindsided again . In the days immediately after the attacks , he and Cheney demanded to see all available raw intelligence reports concerning additional possible threats to America on a daily basis . Cheney had long been a skeptic about the CIA ? s skills , and was particularly insistent on reviewing the data himself . " The mistake , " Cressey concluded later , " was not to have proper analysis of the intelligence before giving it to the President . There was no ? lter . Most of it was garbage . None of it had been corroborated or screened . // But it went directly to the President and his advisers , who are not intelligence experts . That ? s when mistakes got made . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind-altering . It was " like being stuck in a room listening to Led Zeppelin music , " said Jim Baker , former head of the Counsel in the Department of Justice ? s Of ? ce of Intelligence Policy and Review . Readers suffered " sensory overload " and became " paranoid . " Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey believed that the cumulative effect turned national security concerns into " an obsession . " // A sense of constant danger followed Cheney everywhere . When he commuted to his White House of ? ce from the vice presidential residence , he was chauffeured in an armored motorcade that varied its route to foil possible attackers . On the backseat behind Cheney rested a duffel bag stocked with a gas mask and a biochemical surival suit . Rarely did he travel without a medical doctor in tow . // Cheney managed to make light of these macabre arrangements , joking about evading " The Jackal " by varying his routines , and teasing an old friend that , alas , he had too little survival equipment to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attacks , perhaps in combination with his medical problems , had exacerbated his natural pessimism . An old family friend found him changed after September 11 , " more steely , as if he was preoccupied by terrible things he couldn ? t talk about . " Brent Scowcroft , a lifelong acquaintance , told The New Yorker , " I don ? t know him anymore . " In the view of some detractors , such as Lawrence Wilkerson , the chief of staff to former Secretary of State Colin Powell , " Cheney was traumatized by 9/11 . The poor guy became paranoid . " // From the start of the administration , Cheney had con ? dently assumed the national security portfolio for a president with virtually no experience in the area . But Al Qaeda ? s attacks exposed a gaping shortcoming in the Vice President ? s thinking . The Soviet Union , whose threat had preoccupied Cheney and other doomsday planners in the 1980s , was gone . In its place another , more intangible danger had arisen . No one in the Bush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagination to see Bin Laden ? s plot unfolding . // With the notable exception of Richard Clarke , the long-serving head of counterterrorism at the National Security Council , and a few counterterrorism experts at the CIA and FBI , terrorism hadn ? t ranked anywhere near the top of the new administration ? s national security concerns . Later , a number of top of ? cials , including CIA Director George Tenet , would offer evidence that they had been keenly focused on the threat from Bin Laden before the attacks . If so , none succeeded in getting the President and Vice President ? s attention . // When Al Qaeda struck , Cheney and the other hardliners who had spent decades militating for a more martial and aggressive foreign policy were caught off guard . Frozen in a Cold War  --  era mind-set , they overlooked threats posed not by great armed nation-states , but by small , lithe rogue groups waging " asymmetric " warfare . // The Bush White House could have demanded an instant review of how they had been so badly surprised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pearl Harbor , and the results would not have been ? attering . But instead of trying to learn from what had essentially been a colossal bureaucratic failure , combined with inattention and a lack of political will at the top , the Bush White House deferred the focus elsewhere . // The lesson for Bush and Cheney was that terrorists had struck at the United States because they saw the country as soft . Bush worried that the nation was too " materialistic , hedonistic , " and that Bin Laden " didn ? t feel threatened " by it . Confronted with a new enemy and their own intelligence failure , he and Cheney turned to some familiar conservative nostrums that had preoccupied the far right wing of the Republican Party since the Watergate era . There was too much international law , too many civil liberties , too many constraints on the President ? s war powers , too many rights for defendants , and too many rules against lethal covert actions . There was also too much openness and too much meddling by Congress and the press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against the post-Watergate curbs that had been imposed on the president ? s powers since the mid1970s , when he had served as Gerald Ford ? s chief of staff . As Vice President , Cheney had already begun to strengthen the power of the presidency by aggressively asserting executive privilege , most notably on his secrecy-enshrouded energy task force . He ? d told Bush , who later repeated the line , that if nothing else they must leave the of ? ce stronger than they found it . Now Cheney saw the terrorist threat in such catastrophic terms that his end , saving America from possible extinction , justi ? ed virtually any means . As Wilkerson , Powell ? s former Chief of Staff who went on to teach National Security Affairs at George Washington University , put it , " He had a single-minded objective in black and white , that American security was paramount to everything else . He thought that perfect security was achievable . I can ? t fault the man for wanting to keep America safe . But he was willing to corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the White House fears were rational will long be debated . But it was in this feverish atmosphere that a new system of law was devised to vanquish what Bush described as a new kind of enemy in " a war unlike any other . " // Beginning almost immediately after September 11 , 2001 , Cheney saw to it that some of the sharpest and best-trained lawyers in the country , working in secret in the White House and the United States // Department of Justice , came up with legal justi ? cations for a vast expansion of the government ? s power in waging war on terror . // As part of that process , for the ? rst time in its history , the United States sanctioned government of ? cials to physically and psychologically torment U.S.-held captives , making torture the of ? cial law of the land in all but name . // The lawyers also authorized other previously illegal practices , including the secret capture and inde ? nite detention of suspects without charges . Simply by designating the suspects " enemy combatants , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corpus that guarantees a person the right to challenge his imprisonment in front of a fair and independent authority . Once in U.S. custody , the President ? s lawyers said , these suspects could be held incommunicado , hidden from their families and international monitors such as the Red Cross , and subjected to unending abuse , so long as it didn ? t meet the lawyers ? own de ? nition of torture . And they could be held for the duration of the war against terrorism , a struggle in which victory had never been clearly de ? ned . // Few would argue against safeguarding the nation . But in the judgment of at least one of the country ? s most distinguished presidential scholars , the legal steps taken by the Bush Administration in its war against terrorism were a quantum leap beyond earlier blots on the country ? s history and traditions : more signi ? cant than John Adams ? s Alien and Sedition Acts , than Lincoln ? s suspension of habeas corpus during the Civil War , than the imprisonment of Americans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur Schlesinger Jr . argued , the Bush Administration ? s extralegal counterterrorism program presented the most dramatic , sustained , and radical challenge to the rule of law in American history . // Over a lunch at a genteel Upper East Side French restaurant in Manhattan in 2006 , the year before he died , Schlesinger , a liberal Democrat but also an admirer of muscular foreign policy , chose his words slowly and carefully . When asked what he thought of President Bush ? s policy on torture , he peered over his glasses and paused . Schlesinger ? s The Imperial Presidency had described Richard Nixon as pushing the outer limits of abuse of presidential power . Later , his book The Cycles of American History had placed these excesses in a continuum of pendulum swings . With his trademark bow tie askew , Schlesinger considered , and ? nally said , " No position taken has done more damage to the American reputation in the world-ever. " // While there was nothing new about torture , its authorization by Bush Administration lawyers represented a dramatic break with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General George Washington vowed that , unlike the British , who tortured enemy captives , this new country in the New World would distinguish itself by its humanity . In ? ghting to liberate the world from Communism , Fascism , and Nazism , and working to ameliorate global ignorance and poverty , America had done more than any nation on earth to abolish torture and other violations of human rights . // Yet , almost precisely on the sixtieth anniversary of the famous war crimes tribunal ? s judgment in Nuremberg , which established what seemed like an immutable principle , that legalisms and technicalities could not substitute for individual moral choice and conscience , America became the ? rst nation ever to authorize violations of the Geneva Conventions . These international treaties , many of which were hammered out by American lawyers in the wake of the harrowing Nazi atrocities of World War II , set an absolute , minimum baseline for the humane treatment of all categories of prisoners taken in almost all manner of international con ? icts . Rather than lining prisoners up in front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chambers , or subjecting them to grueling physical hardships , all enemy prisoners-even spies and saboteurs-were from then on to be accorded some basic value simply because they were human . America had long played a special role as the world ? s most ardent champion of these fundamental rights ; it was not just a signatory but also the custodian of the Geneva Conventions , the original signed copies of which resided in a vault at the State Department . // Any fair telling of how America came to sacri ? ce so many cherished values in its ? ght against terrorism has to acknowledge that the enemy that the Bush Administration faced on September 11 , and which the country faces still , is both real and terrifying . Often , those in power have felt they simply had no good choices . But this country has in the past faced other mortal enemies , equally if not more threatening , without endangering its moral authority by resorting to state-sanctioned torture . Other democratic nations , meanwhile , have grappled with similar if not greater threats from terrorism without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bush Administration ? s self-destructive response to September 11 , one has to look particularly to Cheney , the doomsday expert and unapologetic advocate of expanding presidential power . Appearing on Meet the Press on the ? rst Sunday after the attacks , Cheney gave a memorable description of how the administration viewed the continuing threat and how it planned to respond . // " We ? ll have to work sort of the dark side , if you will , " Cheney explained in his characteristically quiet and reassuring voice . " We ? ve got to spend time in the shadows in the intelligence world . A lot of what needs to be done here will have to be done quietly , without any discussion , using sources and methods that are available to our intelligence agencies-if we are going to be successful . That ? s the world these folks operate in . And , uh , so it ? s going to be vital for us to use any means at our disposal basically , to achieve our objectives . " // Soon afterward , Cheney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had already begun to shape all that followed . // Library of Congress subject headings for this publication : // War on Terrorism , 2001- // September 11 Terrorist Attacks , 2001  --  Influence . // Military interrogation  --  United States . // War and emergency powers  --  United States . // United States  --  Politics and government  --  2001- // United States  --  History  --  21st century . //
