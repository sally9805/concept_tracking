Everyone hates Microsoft , of course . But you have to love it too . Sure the boys from Redmond , Wash. , play the heavy in every market they dominate , from PC operating systems to desktop software . But when they 're the underdogs , as they are in video games and handheld PCs , they have proved to be scrappy fighters and real innovators . And that translates into better products and choices for consumers . <P> Now Microsoft is about to release a new version of its online software , in a market dominated by America Online , a division of the company that publishes TIME . And in the process it has done something not even Ted Turner could do : awaken AOL from its slumber and force it to offer its most inspired revision in years . I like MSN 8 better because it 's smarter and cheaper . But the new AOL is also pretty cool . There 's a lot of fluff in AOL 8  --  like 1,000 buddy icons , sounds and patterned backgrounds for instant messages  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping ship . <P> The best new feature in MSN 8 is the Dashboard , a narrow , vertical window that snaps to the right-hand side of your screen and gives you at-a-glance views of the things you most want to see , like stock prices , weather reports and which of your buddies are online . All the content on the Dashboard is customizable ; you can even add a personal photo and your own Web links . AOL 8 has something similar called AOL Companion , but because of its awkward design and the way it floats on top of the page , it just gets in the way . <P> The new MSN has added parental controls , like those AOL has offered for years , but MSN 's are better . In addition to choosing from three preset levels for access to Web browsing , e-mail and instant messaging , parents can customize which sites their kids can and can not visit . When children try to go to a restricted site , they have the option of e-mailing their parents for permission . And at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailing exactly which sites their kids visited and how much time they spent there . AOL promises a similar feature  --  AOL Guardian  --  by year-end . In the meantime , it has added an online timer to restrict the hours kids can go online . <P> When it comes to e-mail , MSN 's biggest flaws used to be speed and spam . In the new version , e-mail downloads much more quickly from the company 's Hotmail server , although there is still a slight lag . When I tested MSN 8 , I was pleasantly surprised that less than a third of the spam I received landed in my In box ; the rest was automatically funneled to the junk mailbox . MSN 8 also provides automated virus checking and full-text search for messages in your In box . AOL 8 's mail , on the other hand , is mostly playing catch-up ; the program only now auto-completes addresses after you type in the first few letters ( something MSN has done for years ) . <P> AOL 8 does , however , have some clever touches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in live discussions , not just by the name of the chat room . I like the idea but had mixed results with the searches I tried . A new MusicShare feature lets you send your buddies links to song clips right through the instant-message window . And if your dial-up connection gets dropped , a handy new Auto-Reconnect feature gets you back online in seconds .
