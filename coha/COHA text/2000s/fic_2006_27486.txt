This story first appeared in Manhunt . The editor of the magazine was someone named John McCloud . No one knew who John McCloud was . The poem parody we recited was " I wandered lonely as McCloud . " Well , John McCloud was Scott Meredith . It was very good to be working for the man who was editing the hottest detective magazine of the day ; in 1953 alone , fourteen of my stories appeared in Manhunt under the Marsten , Hunter , or Collins bylines . This one was published in 1955 , under the Evan Hunter byline , which by that time had been my legal name for almost three years . First Offense HE SAT IN THE POLICE VAN WITH THE COLLAR OF HIS leather jacket turned up , the bright silver studs sharp against the otherwise unrelieved black . He was seventeen years old , and he wore his hair in a high black crown . He carried his head high and erect because he knew he had a good profile , and he carried his mouth like a switch knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His hands were thrust deep into his jacket pockets , and his gray eyes reflected the walls of the van . There was excitement in his eyes , too , an almost holiday excitement . He tried to tell himself he was in trouble , but he could n't quite believe it . His gradual descent to disbelief had been a spiral that had spun dizzilythrough the range of his emotions . Terror when the cop 's flash had picked him out ; blind panic when he 'd started to run ; rebellion when the cop 's firm hand had closed around the leather sleeve of his jacket ; sullen resignation when the cop had thrown him into the RMP car ; and then cocky stubbornness when they 'd booked him at the local precinct . The desk sergeant had looked him over curiously , with a strange aloofness in his Irish eyes . " What 's the matter , Fatty ? " he 'd asked . The sergeant stared at him implacably . " Put him away for the night , " the sergeant said . He 'd slept overnight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this strange excitement pulsing through his narrow body , and it was the excitement that had caused his disbelief . Trouble , hell ! He 'd been in trouble before , but it had never felt like this . This was different . This was a ball , man . This was like being initiated into a secret society someplace . His contempt for the police had grown when they refused him the opportunity to shave after breakfast . He was only seventeen , but he had a fairly decent beard , and a man should be allowed to shave in the morning , what the hell ! But even the beard had somehow lent to the unreality of the situation , made him appear -- in his own eyes -- somehow more desperate , more sinister-looking . He knew he was in trouble , but the trouble was glamorous , and he surrounded it with the gossamer lie of make-believe . He was living the storybook legend . He was big time now . They 'd caught him and booked him , and he should have been scared but he was excited instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , a guy who 'd spent the night in the cell block , too . The guy was an obvious bum , and his breath stank of cheap wine , but he was better than nobody to talk to . " Hey ! " he said . The bum looked up . " You talking to me ? " " Yeah . Where we going ? " " The lineup , kid , " the bum said . " This your first offense ? " " This 's the first time I got caught , " he answered cockily . " All felonies go to the lineup , " the bum told him . " And also some special types of misdemeanors . You commit a felony ? " " Yeah , " he said , hoping he sounded nonchalant . What 'd they have this bum in for anyway ? Sleeping on a park bench ? " Well , that 's why you 're goin ' to the lineup . They have guys from every detective squad in the city there , to look you over . So they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stage , and they read off the offense , and the Chief of Detectives starts firing questions at you . What 's your name , kid ? " " What 's it to you ? " " Do n't get smart , punk , or I 'll break your arm , " the bum said . He looked at the bum curiously . He was a pretty big guy , with a heavy growth of beard , and powerful shoulders . " My name 's Stevie , " he said . " I 'm Jim Skinner , " the bum said . " When somebody 's trying to give you advice , do n't go hip on him . . . " " Yeah , well , what 's your advice ? " he asked , not wanting to back down completely . " When they get you up there , you do n't have to answer anything . They 'll throw questions but you do n't have to answer . Did you make a statement at the scene ? " " No , " he answered . " Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They ca n't force you to . Just keep your mouth shut , and do n't tell them nothing . " " I ai n't afraid . They know all about it anyway , " Stevie said . The bum shrugged and gathered around him the sullen pearls of his scattered wisdom . Stevie sat in the van whistling , listening to the accompanying hum of the tires , hearing the secret hum of his blood beneath the other louder sound . He sat at the core of a self-imposed importance , basking in its warm glow , whistling contentedly , secretly happy . Beside him , Skinner leaned back against the wall of the van . When they arrived at the Center Street Headquarters , they put them in detention cells , awaiting the lineup which began at nine . At ten minutes to nine they led him out of his cell , and the cop who 'd arrested him originally took him into the special prisoners ' elevator . " How 's it feel being an elevator boy ? " he asked the cop . The cop did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room where the lineup was being held . A detective in front of them was pinning on his shield so he could get past the cop at the desk . They crossed the large gymnasium-like compartment , walking past the men sitting in folded chairs before the stage . " Get a nice turnout , do n't you ? " Stevie said . " You ever tried vaudeville ? " the cop answered . The blinds in the room had not been drawn yet , and Stevie could see everything clearly . The stage itself with the permanently fixed microphone hanging from a narrow metal tube above ; the height markers -- four feet , five feet , six feet -- behind the mike on the wide white wall . The men in the seats , he knew , were all detectives and his sense of importance suddenly flared again when he realized these bulls had come from all over the city just to look at him . Behind the bulls was a raised platform with a sort of lecturer 's stand on it . A microphone rested on the stand , and a chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Chief bull would sit . There were uniformed cops stationed here and there around the room , and there was one man in civilian clothing who sat at a desk in front of the stage . " Who 's that ? " Stevie asked the cop . " Police stenographer , " the cop answered . " He 's going to take down your words for posterity . " They walked behind the stage , and Stevie watched as other felony offenders from all over the city joined them . There was one woman , but all the rest were men , and he studied their faces carefully , hoping to pick up some tricks from them , hoping to learn the subtlety of their expressions . They did n't look like much . He was better-looking than all of them , and the knowledge pleased him . He 'd be the star of this little shindig . The cop who 'd been with him moved over to talk to a big broad who was obviously a policewoman . Stevie looked around , spotted Skinner , and walked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They 're gon na pull the shades in a few minutes , " Skinner said . " Then they 'll turn on the spots and start the lineup . The spots wo n't blind you , but you wo n't be able to see the faces of any of the bulls out there . " " Who wants to see them mugs ? " Stevie asked . Skinner shrugged . " When your case is called , your arresting officer goes back and stands near the Chief of Detectives , just in case the Chief needs more dope from him . The Chief 'll read off your name and the borough where you was pinched . A number 'll follow the borough . Like he 'll say ' Manhattan one ' or ' Manhattan two . ' That 's just the number of the case from that borough . You 're first , you get number one , you follow ? " " Yeah , " Stevie said . " He 'll tell the bulls what they got you on , and then he 'll say either ' Statement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a statement , chances are he wo n't ask many questions ' cause he wo n't want you to contradict anything damaging you already said . If there 's no statement , he 'll fire questions like a machine gun . But you do n't have to answer nothing . " " Then what ? " " When he 's through , you go downstairs to get mugged and printed . Then they take you over to the Criminal Courts Building for arraignment . " " They 're gon na take my picture , huh ? " Stevie asked . Continues ...
