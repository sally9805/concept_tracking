<p> Will the Grinch steal Thanksgiving at American multiplexes , giving a jolt of energy to a box-office year that 's faring a little less vigorously than industry insiders would like ? Hollywood is n't exactly running scared , but its lights are n't blazing quite as brightly as last year at this time . So far , 2000 has grossed about 1 percent less than 1999 , according to the entertainment trade paper Variety . Studios are hoping November and December will turn the trajectory back in an upward direction . There 's nothing much they can do about the situation , though , short of the audience-pounding promotional campaigns they 've been waging for months on behalf of their safest box-office bets . It takes time to make a major motion picture , and this winter 's crop of wannabe blockbusters and starry-eyed Oscar contenders has been in the pipeline for ages . So executives can only sit back and hope they made the right choices when they greenlighted this batch - which happens to be long on fantasy and escapism , and short on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In short , it 's hard to predict which products of the dream factory have the best prospects of leading the pack between now and New Year 's Eve . Here are some of the leading contenders : Unbreakable , Nov. 22 . What made " The Sixth Sense " such a megahit last year ? Child actor Haley Joel Osment surely helped , but his similar work in " Pay It Forward " has failed to spark similar results . So eyes inevitably turn to director M. Night Shyamalan and star Bruce Willis , who have teamed again for this somewhat similar fantasy . Willis plays an ordinary guy who survives a deadly train wreck without a scratch , and Samuel L. Jackson plays his opposite , a man whose illness makes life an everyday ordeal . The action leans toward supernatural mystery more than conventional human interest , but if these ingredients are mixed in the right proportions , the picture 's earnings could be huge . 102 Dalmatians , Nov. 22 . Disney released its excellent feature-length cartoon " 101 Dalmatians " in 1961 , and unveiled its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of computer enhancement - just four years ago . Now the franchise moves into sequel mode , serving up more of Cruella De Vil 's canine-crazy machinations along with those of a French fur merchant who 's as greedy and goofy as she is . Glenn Close returns as the wicked dognapper and European superstar Gerard Depardieu makes one of his rare English-language appearances as her shady new partner . Hollywood will also be judging the directorial expertise of Kevin Lima , who made a big Disney splash with the animated " Tarzan " and hopes to do the same with flesh-and blood characters this time around . Vertical Limit , Dec. 8 . Wags are already calling this " The Perfect Snowstorm , " but business-savvy observers are n't joking when they predict high-altitude results for this mountain-climbing epic . Chris O'Donnell plays a mountaineer who gives up the game after his father takes a deadly fall , then heads back to the slopes when his sister becomes trapped at a teetering height near the world 's second-highest peak . This kind of blend - scenery , scares , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summertime , but moviegoers may trek to it eagerly if its adventurous premise pays off . Proof of Life , Dec. 8 . The latest movie inspired by a magazine article plunges into the high-anxiety world of hostage negotiators . Russell Crowe plays an abduction expert who falls in love with an engineer 's wife ( Meg Ryan ) while trying to pry her husband ( David Morse ) loose from South American kidnappers . Taylor Hackford directed the thriller , hoping for at least as much audience appeal as he whipped up in " The Devil 's Advocate " three years ago , and Crowe , still hot from " Gladiator " and " The Insider , " is surely hankering for an Oscar nod . Ryan could also surprise us , and it will be interesting to see the latest twist in Morse 's low-key career , which stretches from the overcooked fantasy of " The Green Mile " to the avant-garde " Dancer in the Dark . " What Women Want , Dec. 15 . Mel Gibson 's box-office infallibility came under fire in " The Patriot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comedy about a PR man who discovers he 's telepathic - with female minds only - after his brain gets fried in a freak accident . Among the women who want him are Helen Hunt , fresh from " Dr. T &; the Women " and " Pay It Forward , " and Marisa Tomei , a gifted star who does n't always get first-rate roles . Nancy Meyers directed , and it will be fascinating to see if she 's successfully ushered Gibson into the romantic territory he 's avoided in his otherwise versatile career . The Family Man , Dec. 15 . Nicolas Cage is n't celebrated for romantic comedy either , but the " Moonstruck " side of his personality may shine in director Brett Ratner 's take on the " Sliding Doors " genre , about a banker who experiences what would have happened if he 'd married the long-lost love of his life . Tea Leoni and Don Cheadle also star . Cast Away , Dec. 22 . Robert Zemeckis directed last summer 's spooky " What Lies Beneath " during a 12-month break in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause so that Tom Hanks could lose enough weight to be convincing in the story 's second half . His character is an emaciated wreck who 's been stranded so long on a deserted island that he 's not always sure whether he 's alive or dead . Nick Searcy and the ubiquitous Helen Hunt also appear in the picture , but advance reports stress the one-man-band side of the production , with Hanks carrying the tale almost entirely on his bony shoulders . Will he deliver for the director who guided him to superstardom in " Forrest Gump , " or will the whole enterprise look like an overlong " Survivor " rerun ? Stay tuned . Thirteen Days , Dec. 20 . A hard-pressed president , his trusted attorney general , and a White House aide wrestle with an international crisis of terrifying proportions . It sounds like another contrived political thriller until you realize that the first two characters are John F. Kennedy and his brother Robert F. Kennedy , and that the emergency is the Cuban missile crisis , an event so dramatic that it 's surprising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greenwood and Steven Culp play the Kennedy brothers , but audience curiosity will be focused on Kevin Costner as the assistant who advises and counsels them . Miss Congeniality , Dec. 22 . Comedy connoisseurs recall Michael Ritchie 's hilarious " Smile " as the funniest beauty-pageant parody of all time , but Donald Petrie 's new farce wants to take over that title . Sandra Bullock plays an FBI agent with a strong unfeminine streak ( sounds like dubious casting ) who infiltrates a beauty contest for professional reasons . The coming-attractions trailer looks promising , but it remains to be seen whether the director of " Grumpy Old Men " can spin similar magic with Gorgeous Young Girls . All the Pretty Horses , Dec. 25 . Successful westerns have been as scarce as silver bullets lately , but Billy Bob Thornton thinks there 's life in the old genre yet . He 's directed this romantic horse opera from a Ted Tally screenplay based on Cormac McCarthy 's bestselling novel . Thornton roped in Matt Damon and Henry Thomas to play spunky buckaroos who ride into Mexico for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Penelope Cruz 's glowing smile . If we little dogies git along to the ticket window , the picture could revitalize westerns the way " Unforgiven " did eight years ago . If not , look for Hollywood to hang up its spurs for a mighty long spell . Shadow of the Vampire , Dec. 29 . Run to your nearest video store and check out " Nosferatu , " the 1921 silent-film classic about a German vampire . Then get ready for this new comic nightmare about the making of " Nosferatu , " based on the premise that the movie 's star was an actual vampire who agreed to play himself in return for a bite of the leading lady 's neck ! John Malkovich is fine as the brilliant German director F.W. Murnau , but Willem Dafoe steals the show as the undead actor whose bloodthirsty habits wreak havoc on the set . Directed by the inventive E. Elias Merhige , this cinema-struck fantasy closes the 2000 release slate with shudders and laughs alike , and Oscar will surely take notice of Dafoe 's daunting talent . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society
