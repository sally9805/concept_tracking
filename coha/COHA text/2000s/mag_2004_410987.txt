Pee problem ? Q My child has to go to the bathroom all the time ! Could she have a urinary-tract infection ? A Probably not , since frequency alone is rarely a sign of a urinary-tract infection ( UTI ) . Usually , other symptoms are also present , such as a burning sensation when urinating , pain around the bladder area , or-in the unlikely event that the infection has extended from the bladder to the kidney-fever , chills , and back and belly pain . That said , a child may have a slight bladder infection without any of these symptoms ( though that 's rare ) . To make sure it 's not a UTI , ask your doctor to test your child 's urine for signs of an infection . It 's very important not to miss a UTI , since it can result in kidney damage if untreated . In most cases , it 's a good sign that a child empties her bladder often . Deliberately holding it when it 's full-something kids tend to do when they 're embarrassed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or do n't want to interrupt their play-can set her up for a bladder infection . The best way to help prevent infections ( even if your child is diligent about relieving herself ) is to have her : * Drink plenty of water ( it P flushes out harmful bacteria that can cause UTIs ) . * Avoid bubble baths or long soaks in soapy water , which can irritate the urethra and wash away the mucous layer that blocks germs. * Wear loose-fitting cotton underpants , for more breathability. * Wipe from front to back to keep bowel germs from entering the urethra , which is shorter and closer to the rectum in girls . No-allergy feeding Q How can I prevent my newborn from developing food allergies ? A You 're smart to start planning now . Some babies are very susceptible to food allergies , and there are experts who feel that what you feed your infant can also affect his chances of developing them later in life . Babies ' intestines are immature in the early months . If you 're breastfeeding and have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ) , you 'll want to limit your own intake of dairy products , eggs , and peanuts-all foods that typically incite early food sensitivity . ( A mother 's milk , by the way , is rich in proteins that may help reduce a child 's risk of allergies . ) If you 're a mother who bottle-feeds-and has had food allergies-your best bet is to feed your infant a hypoallergenic formula , in which the allergenic proteins are already predigested . Fortunately , this vulnerable time is shortlived . Around the 4-month mark , a baby 's intestinal lining develops a " closure , " meaning it 's more selective about what it lets pass through . At this point , you can now safely introduce solids into your child 's diet , but only the least allergenic ones , like rice and most fruits and veggies , in small amounts that are " friendly " to his maturing intestines . My suggestion is to start gradually : Try feeding your baby a couple of spoonfuls of cereal before you offer him a whole bowl . Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good news is that most kids generally outgrow them-usually by age 2 . But if your child had reactions to certain foods as a baby , check with an allergist before you reintroduce any of them into his diet . Sleep Q Help ! When should my baby be steeping soundly through the night ? A Do n't worry : Babies ' sleep habits are as variable as their daytime personalities . You may be surprised to hear that experts deem as little as a five-hour stretch " sleeping through the night " - and most babies ( and their tired parents ) do n't even enjoy this until around 5 months . The reason is natural : Infants are born with a protective mechanism that immediately awakens them if they have a need for food , comfort , warmth , or anything else that may be important to their well-being . So you should never force your baby into a state of sleep . Trying to " teach " him to snooze uninterrupted through the night by ignoring his cries or denying him a feeding can be dangerous . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " a medical condition in which a baby does not grow to optimal physical or developmental standards ; in some cases , I believe it 's because forced sleeping patterns deprived them of the human touch and nutrients their developing bodies craved . Bottom line : It 's normal for babies to get hungry at night . And if you 're breastfeeding your infant , he 'll likely awaken even more frequently , since breast milk is digested more quickly than formula . That hunger may intensify when a nursing mother first returns to work-a concern I hear often in my practice . Until your baby becomes more comfortable with your new schedule , he may literally " milk " you for as much as he can during the night . A consistent sleep schedule during the day can help , though , so if you 're a working mom , ask your baby 's caregiver to stick to daily naptimes . Keep in mind that how much-or how little-your baby snoozes is not a reflection of your parenting skills . The best thing you can do for your infant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feed him right before bedtime . As your child grows , he 'll gain " sleep maturity " and everyone will enjoy longer periods of rest .
