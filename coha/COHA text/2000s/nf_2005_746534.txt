Fishing on the high seas was a feature of societies long before large areas of the world 's seas were claimed by nation states . The Basques fished for Atlantic cod off Newfoundland ; tuna was fished first by the Japanese and later by many other longline , pole-and-line and purse seine fleets ; whaling , which began in the Atlantic in the 15th century , has taken place in all oceans , including the Southern Ocean. ( n1 ) <p> Throughout history , fishery developments have been driven by new technologies , enterprising practitioners and economic incentives . Over the millennia , improved boats , fishing gear and navigational knowledge have enabled humans to explore and exploit greater ranges of marine stocks in more distant waters and at increasing depths. ( n2 ) However , inshore and offshore fisheries have always developed faster than the institutions that govern them . This combination of technology , enterprise and market dynamics raises the question : Are high seas fishery resources economically and environmentally sustainable ? <p> This paper explores the sustainability of international and high seas fisheries . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are tractable or if they indeed represent an ultimately futile sustainability challenge . Among the solutions examined are international legal arrangements , fishery institutions , economic and trade instruments , scientific and public knowledge , and aquaculture . All solutions are feasible , but even the best amalgamation of strategies will only succeed if political governance pays much more attention to the problem . HIGH SEAS FISHERIES AND THE PATH TO INTERNATIONAL REGULATION <p> While inland transboundary waterways , such as Lake Victoria , the Mekong River and the Caspian Sea , present significant difficulties , far greater complexity arises with international and high seas fisheries : Their physical distance from land and direct oversight make them difficult and costly to monitor , assess and regulate . The worldwide excess of fishing vessels that are capable of exploiting the high seas compounds this situation . <p> However , international conventions , treaties and commissions did not begin to regulate fishing of even the most prominent species until soon after World War II . The first of these was the International Convention on the Regulation of Whaling and the International Whaling Commission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies as the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission in 1950 and the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna in 1968. ( n3 ) <p> On the high seas , property rights and territorial limits are very difficult to define , regulate and enforce. ( n4 ) In 1949 , the United Nations International Law Commission began codifying existing coastal laws and working toward a convention on the seas . The UN Law of the Sea Conferences in 1958 , 1960 and from 1973 to 1982 eventually led to an agreement on the more comprehensive United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea ( UNCLOS ) , which came into force in 1994 when it was ratified by 60 countries . <p> This convention remains the chief international instrument of ocean governance . It specifically reaffirms the principles of " freedom of the high seas , " and " freedom of fishing , " albeit within certain limits. ( n5 ) <p> Since UNCLOS was established , both sovereign nations and multilateral institutions have sought to bring greater order to high seas fisheries by ( 1 ) applying inter national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ( 2 ) creating and strengthening international fishery institutions , ( 3 ) improving scientific and public knowledge of fisheries , and ( 4 ) turning to aquaculture as a possible source of additional fish . Each of these solutions have merit , but a close examination of each option and its potential permutations nonetheless reveals major challenges to resource sustainability , as the following analysis demonstrates . INTERNATIONAL FRAMEWORKS , MIGRATORY FISH STOCKS AND MARINE CONSERVATION <p> Since the late 1970s , the delimitation of 200-nautical mile fishing zones and exclusive economic zones has created more international fisheries , while reducing the area of high seas fisheries . Territorial claims have also led countries to pay more attention to their offshore fisheries and often stimulated further exploration and off shore fishing , including on the high seas , as well as in the waters of other countries ( distant water fishing ) . <p> The expansion of fisheries throughout the late 1970s and 1980s presaged problematic decreases in fish stocks , particularly in areas where fish stocks straddled national boundaries . Examples include the Atlantic cod stock off Newfoundland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tuna stocks in the Southern ocean. ( n6 ) In 1992 , the UN Food and Agriculture Organization ( FAO ) summarized all available existing knowledge of marine fisheries stocks. ( n7 ) This was the first major overview to highlight the intense pressures on major fish stocks leading to the publication of other reports as well as press coverage of the issue. ( n8 ) <p> Recognizing that UNCLOS did not provide sufficient protection for border straddling fish populations , the United Nations established the 1995 Agreement for the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks ( UN Fish Stocks Agreement ) and , for all fisheries , the non-binding FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries . The UN Fish Stocks Agreement : <p> ? Elaborates on the general principles of regional fisheries management organizations and the conservation of straddling and migratory fish stocks ; <p> ? Applies the concept of the precautionary approach to the conservation and management of these stocks ; <p> ? Elaborates on the obligation of states to cooperate in the conservation and management of straddling and highly migratory fish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels to fish for such stocks  --  unless the state is party to , or cooperates with , any sub-regional or regional fisheries organization  --  or an arrangement that has the competence to establish conservation and management measures for the stock concerned ; <p> ? Details the obligations of states with respect to vessels flying their flags on the high seas ; <p> ? Introduces innovative enforcement provisions for the high seas , and provisions with respect to the requirements of developing states. ( n9 ) <p> This agreement attempts to provide for much broader conservation and sustainability of high seas fisheries through its provisions for national and regional management bodies , its enhanced enforcement of existing restrictions , and its more pre cautionary approach to conservation and exploitation . In addition , critical factors that might have affected its implementation were further elaborated through formal , non-binding international instruments in subsequent years . Moreover , the FAO devised international plans of action ( IPOAs ) to protect birds , sharks and fishing capacity. ( n10 ) <p> International legal instruments like IPOAs are of great interest to conservationists , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ global governance on the high seas . At the 2003 World Parks Congress , the World Conservation Union ( IUCN ) agreed on a 10-year strategy to create a system of high seas protect ed areas as a key conservation tool for marine life . This high seas initiative , however , faces a considerable legal challenge. ( n11 ) <p> Marine conservation extends beyond the realm of fish . During the 1970s and 1980s , convergent pressures called for the cessation of whaling-both for the protection of remaining commercial species , and for conservation and animal welfare which led to the IWC 's moratorium on commercial whaling in 1986 . Since , a small number of countries have continued to whale under scientific permits . The 66 cur rent member countries of the IWC have mixed interests with respect to whaling and whale conservation . <p> In addition to whaling concerns , other wildlife conservation issues have drawn public attention . High seas fishing gear has taken a toll on sea bird , turtle and other marine mammal populations , while bottom trawling wreaks disaster on sea mount biodiversity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustaining fish stocks and other wildlife , but the different mechanisms available for addressing these abuses require serious and critical consideration . Responding to Illegal , Unregulated and Unreported Fishing <p> Fishing pioneers are among the most innovative entrepreneurs and the most daring seafarers . The trade carries significant risks , and its occupational mortality rates exceed those of all other occupations , including fire fighters and police. ( n12 ) For centuries however , fishing products have commanded high prices , and this industry has flourished . Unfortunately , the culprits of illegal , unregulated and unreported fishing ( IUU ) also pervade this market , to the detriment of the legitimate fisheries industry , wildlife conservation and the environment . <p> In recognition of the escalating threat posed by IUU practices , the phenomenon of IUU fishing was raised at the 1997 Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Living Marine Resources. ( n13 ) The term , IUU , has since been widely adopted and the concept has provided a focal point for improving high seas fishery management . Part of this recognition entailed linking IUU fishing practices  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forms of illegal trafficking that may have been exacerbated by economic globalization. ( n14 ) <p> The scale of IUU practices is substantial . A 2005 study by the London-based Marine Resources Assessment Group estimated that IUU fishing in sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 19 percent of the region 's current landed value . The study estimated the total value of this illicit practice at nearly $1 billion. ( n15 ) <p> Having attained increasing visibility , these illicit practices rank today as perhaps the most critical high seas fisheries issue . In March 2005 , the FAG sponsored a special ministerial meeting that established the Rome Declaration on Illegal , Unreported and Unregulated Fishing. ( n16 ) In addition to recommitting themselves to the IUU instruments and actions , the ministers urged the director general of the FAO to bring the declaration to the attention of the UN secretary general . Yet while international legal instruments , voluntary codes and action plans are useful for garnering global awareness and initiative frameworks , the magnitude of IUU activities indicates that these are only a start . <p> Another way to curtail IUU @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent of high seas catches enter into international markets . And given the economic incentives underlying IUU fishing , socio-economic solutions should be sought as well. ( n17 ) The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development 's approach to addressing this problem is to reduce the cost-benefit ratio based on an economic theory of crime. ( n18 ) At the government level , the actions promoted relate to compliance enhancing initiatives within the regional fishery bodies ( RFBs ) , such as comprehensive ship registers and measures affecting the trade in IUU products . Given that most IUU fishery products from the high seas are of high value and are targeted to defined markets , the latter measure holds some promise , especially when assisted by private sector initiatives such as the Coalition of Legal Tooth fish Operators ( COLTO ) and the Organization for the Promotion of Responsible Tuna Fisheries. ( n19 ) The Marine Stewardship Council , for example , allows its logo to be used on fishery products with a Chain of Custody certificate to verify that they come from sustainable , non-IUU fisheries. ( n20 ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IUU fishing , and may lead to sustainable practices in the future . However , these measures require more robust fishery institutions and global coordination , particularly at the market level . In time , product certification and consumer education schemes will likely gain importance , but they are not a substitute for national and international management regimes. ( n21 ) International Fisheries Institutions <p> Even before legal instruments like UNCLOS were developed , special international institutions were created to affect multilateral cooperation over shared use marine resources . Most of these institutions , and some additional ones , are now part of a system of regional fishery organizations. ( n22 ) <p> The FAO lists 18 RFBs that are management-oriented , 21 advisory bodies that provide administrative and scientific advice and six that are dedicated solely to scientific advice and information. ( n23 ) In her review of the historical development of the RFBs and their movement toward a managerial role , Judith Swan highlights two watershed events : the 1982 UNCLOS and the 1995 UN Fish Stocks Agreement , with the latter setting out specific functions for the regional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urgent tasks regarding membership , obligations of non-members , environment and fish conservation , international data sharing and the implementation and enforcement of decisions . Swan stresses that decision-making should be transparent , timely at all levels , and contain clear conflict resolution mechanisms . However , she finds that most RFBs have not addressed this need for improved decision-making , noting that the current consolidation period  --  essentially a period of implementation  --  offers a chance for the bodies to address this need. ( n24 ) <p> According to the FAO , conflicts of interest prevail within many RFBs , especially , but not exclusively , when members represent diverse national interests and blackly , grounds ; this is exemplified by differences among developing and developed nations , both coastal and non-coastal , distant water fishing nations and even flag states. ( n25 ) According to the FAO : <p> For some contracting parties , fisheries constitute a vital economic interest , while for other states , they constitute a middle or low-level economic interest . Such diversity results in varied commitments , levels of participation , and expectations regarding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ core challenge to regional management regimes , however , is the question of fishing rights. ( n27 ) Effective fishery governance systems must control fishing activity over the entire range of the resource , while assigning rights to shares of the fishery . Individual fishermen and fishing states are more likely to accept short-term sacrifices for long-term gains if fishing rights are secure . The issue of national rights to high seas and international fisheries is often the dominant consideration ; new analysis is thus necessary to develop the allocation of resources . The protected marine areas approach , while incomplete and addressing only non-use and limited use areas is one of the important concepts framing the question of rights on the high seas . <p> A major task that RFBs confront is achieving the inclusion and compliance of all fishing vessels , given that vessels of non-member states often catch fish outside of quota or legal frameworks . Allocations of fishing catch have traditionally been made on the basis of catch histories but as catch reductions have become necessary , this allocation rule is no longer adequate for large geographic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , signatories to the 1994 Convention for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna , originally an agreement between Australia , Japan and New Zealand , have made strong efforts to enlist Indonesia , the Republic of Korea and Taiwan as members . By the end of 2002 , only Korea and Taiwan had joined . In 2004 , after the Commission for the Conservation of Southern Bluefin Tuna  --  the regional body set up by the parties to this convention  --  passed a resolution on the status of cooperating non-member countries , the Philippines enlisted as a cooperating non-member and Indonesia and South Africa entered discussions as well. ( n28 ) While the prospect of new catch limitations may discourage states from joining such conventions , membership ensures that a nation 's vessels are granted good standing , which would facilitate their access to international markets . <p> The adequacy of the existing RFBs has been put in question by fish and wildlife conservation problems , such as the replenishment of southern bluefin tuna stocks and the protection of leatherback and other threatened sea turtles. ( n29 ) In some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishery and turtle habitat conservation measures should adhere to regional conservation agreements , such as the Convention on Migratory Species. ( n30 ) A new regional legal framework specifically for turtles has yet to be created . <p> Looking beyond such species-specific conservation cases , however , the FAO suggests that a fishery-by-fishery approach for management of the largely unregulated deep sea fisheries may not be sufficient and that a more global , compliance-based method is needed. ( n31 ) Writing from a biodiversity conservation perspective , Stuart Kaye also seeks supra-regional solutions to the question of oversight of high seas protected areas , suggesting that the International Seabed Authority ( ISA ) , which is the only body that has jurisdiction over the seabed in areas beyond the continental shelves , is an appropriate body. ( n32 ) The ISA does have a provision for environmental protection , however , it has not yet exercised it . Kaye also notes that certain commercial sectors and political interests have resisted the establishment of high seas protected areas , particularly when they are perceived to interfere with military or mercantile navigation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powerful countries and superpower blocs , especially the United States , Russia , Japan , China and the European Union. ( n33 ) <p> Thus , while the responsible RFBs are considered essential elements in high seas and international sustainability , they suffer from several shortcomings . These include the development of suitable rights-based management systems , the heterogeneous interests and capacities of member states and the need for more integrated global approaches to enforcing fisheries and other wildlife conservation . Scientific and Public Knowledge <p> Successful fisheries management requires sound knowledge of fish stocks , their environment and their exploitable potential . Beyond that , precautionary and ecosystem-based approaches require comprehensive and multidisciplinary forms of scientific knowledge. ( n34 ) To accommodate evolving needs , international scientific groups , such as the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea , which advises the European Union on fisheries management , have developed additional reference points that incorporate ecological quality and precautionary reference points. ( n35 ) <p> Knowledge of sufficient precision and timeliness for management purposes is most often missing in high seas fisheries . The cost of creating such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fishery resources it supports , is constantly changing , especially in response to global climate conditions . More comprehensive information systems include the Global Ocean Observing System , which is now being integrated into the 10-year plan for the Global Earth Observing System of Systems ( GEOSS ) program. ( n36 ) In addition , innovative research programs such as the Census of Marine Life , a 10-year initiative by scientists in 70 countries , are helping to develop new partnerships and technologies that examine the intersection of marine life and fisheries , in areas from sea mounts to open upper oceans. ( n37 ) <p> Despite the growing scientific knowledge of many over fished fish stocks and the emerging efforts to cultivate more information , the complexity of marine animal populations may still confound good management . The Atlantic bluefin tuna illustrates this phenomenon well. ( n38 ) Though relatively well studied , there is still considerable debate over the extent to which the eastern and western Atlantic stocks of this large tuna species crossbreed . The eastern stock is much larger than the western one , which appears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recent studies indicate that more mixing from the two stocks occurs than was previously estimated. ( n39 ) Yet both populations have been managed as if they were separate . Provided that the total of the respective catch limits is sustainable , managing these stocks as two distinct parts is an effective conservation method . However , a dilemma arises when parties fishing from both regions have conflicting perceptions of stock abundance . This may lead to a dispute over catch allocations and the areas in which they are allowed to operate . Again , the allocation issues stress the importance of clearly defined rights across every fishing range . <p> Changes caused by humans and other factors may also permanently alter the natural community and composition of a marine ecosystem , thus making knowledge of past abundance and productivity less relevant for future management . For instance , fishing was largely responsible for the rapid evolutionary shift in Atlantic cod sizes near the Scotian Shelf near Canada. ( n40 ) In addition to fishing , decadal climate patterns and long-term climate changes also affect fisheries . For example , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the last 25 years. ( n41 ) The mean latitude-and depth-ranges for nearly two-thirds of all fish species in the North Sea have changed , and many have shifted northward as waters warm . Smaller and faster-growing species are those most likely to have shifted. ( n42 ) <p> Despite these examples , many management problems stem from a more predictable source : insufficient attention to scientific advice . For example , the parlous state of many North Sea and North Atlantic fisheries is not due to poor scientific advice but rather to a continued gap between actual quota reductions and the much larger ones recommended by ICES scientists . Other researchers argue for matters that are more fundamental than the lack of good science ; they blame the lack of appropriate fishing rights and incentives. ( n43 ) Thus , in prevailing management systems , even the best scientific advice will not ensure successful fisheries management . <p> In recent years , fishery science has been not only the preserve of publicly fund ed government and university experts ; it has also become a weapon for non-government conservation groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientific and conservationist approaches may overlap , in the end , they require the same key actors : governments and the fishing and seafood industries. ( n45 ) Conservationists attempt to shift political power from the fishing industry , thereby creating more space for governments to act . Both approaches rely on scientific information and value systems that target more sustainable outcomes. ( n46 ) Past failures to heed scientific and conservationist advice , however , have been numerous , and they suggest that information and knowledge alone will not save high seas fisheries . Political support and technologically feasible methods are also needed . Aquaculture <p> A final potential solution is culturing fish to meet growing world demand and help reverse declining trends of high seas fish stocks . The insistence of shifting from hunting to farming fish is often a superficially attractive approach because of human experience in cultivating food through agriculture . About 10,000 years ago , humans began to cultivate and domesticate wild animal and plant food species . Similar innovations in the artificial rearing of aquatic animals and plants began about 4,000 years ago , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new means for breeding species such as carp and shrimp . As a result , greater supply led to a rise in market demand for fish. ( n47 ) In 2002 , one-third of the world 's total food fish supply was derived from aquaculture , the fastest growing sector of production. ( n48 ) <p> Despite the attraction of aquaculture , biological and ecological reviews , such as those by Rosemond Naylor et al. , and economic and governance studies , such as Rognvaldur Hannesson 's , have indicated that aquaculture can have negative impacts on total fish supplies . Total fish supplies decline when large quantities of low-priced fish are used as feed to grow a reduced quantity of higher value fish . The fisheries that supply low-priced feed fish are effectively unregulated , especially in developing countries. ( n49 ) In addition , the aquaculture operations often interact ecologically with those of wild fisheries . One example concerns mangroves that are destroyed to create fish and shrimp ponds . Aquaculture , therefore , should be developed with due concern for its impact on the environment and natural fishery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a necessary adjunct to marine and inland fish supplies for human food , it is not a substitute for the sustainable management of natural resources , especially for species fished on the high seas. ( n50 ) <p> What is the feasibility of aquaculture with high seas species , and how will this impact declining stocks ? On the one hand , many such species appear attractive for culture because of their market value . However , given that many different species are caught , difficult choices have to be made. ( n51 ) Most such species have long life spans and are high level predators whose feed requirements alone would place added pres sure fish supplies unless alternative sources are found . The knowledge of most species ' biology would also need refining , especially if they were to be bred and reared in captivity . <p> Intermediate forms of cultivation are also possible , such as stock enhancement and sea ranching whereby captive breeding is used to produce fish fry ( i.e. immature fish ) and juveniles that are released into the wild . This has never been attempted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cultivation is similar to feed-lot production for land based livestock . In this method , juvenile from the wild , placed in sea cages and fed intensively for several months before they are killed , dressed and shipped to high-value markets . Cultivating species such as the southern bluefin tuna , for example , have proven attractive to the fishing industry. ( n52 ) Although lucrative , such cultivation does not solve the decline in natural parent populations , since these fish are not returned to high seas populations . These enterprises also consume large volumes of other lower-value fish . Thus , while the aquaculture of fish and other aquatic species is vital to world fish supplies and human consumption , it does little good and much harm to high seas stocks . CONCLUSIONS <p> This paper has touched on some proposed solutions for the sustainable management of high seas and international fisheries . International laws , regional institutions , economic and trade instruments , and scientific and public knowledge may have a positive impact , yet aquaculture is unlikely to enhance sustainability where it is most needed , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high feed requirements . <p> The solutions outlined above are partial at best . Only if they are integrated will their effects be measurable . For example , RFBs are vitally dependent on international laws and codes , especially UNCLOS , the UN Fish Stocks Agreement , the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and its IPOAs . Additionally , the potential of these organizations is based largely on the implementation of legal instruments . The 1997 recognition of IUU fishing demonstrated how economic and social tools can be brought to boost the sustainability of fisheries . These tools make use of private sector instruments such as certification and consumer education and rely on observers ' ability to trace fish from their moment of capture through to consumption . <p> These methods , however , also require participation from national governments and multilateral institutions . International collaboration is needed to deal with ships that sail under " flags of convenience , " so called because they are registered by states with few stringent operating requirements . Regulations need to be enforced both on the high seas and at the docks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists must now pursue precautionary approaches and ecosystem-based concepts in fishery management , and take into account expectations of climate change . The growing conservation movement concerned with high seas and deep sea fishing has raised public awareness but has not removed the need for concerted national and regional action . <p> The key questions that all parties face are whether the necessary actions are being undertaken with sufficient measure and urgency , and whether additional global coordination and monitoring instruments or bodies that create a more competent system for managing high seas fisheries are also necessary These same dilemmas exist in land-based resource and species conservation debates . However , on the high seas , the lack of clear ownership rights and responsibility for resources exacerbates the risk of overexploitation . In a political sense , the urgency of high seas fishery management may tend toward the freedom of access imperative . With few countries possessing the capacity to exploit high seas fisheries , decisions regarding the future of these resources are now balanced between countries with the most experience , a handful of recent entrants and the ever growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Despite the daunting outlook for high seas fisheries , they present a real opportunity  --  the opportunity for nations , regional institutions , international law-makers , commercial industries , consumers , conservationists and scientists each to do their part . <p>
