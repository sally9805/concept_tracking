Jeff Williams VICKI Byrne stared at the man . She could n't believe he was actually Buck Williams 's brother . " I live with my dad not far from here , " Jeff said . " We 've tried to keep the business going , but it 's been tough . " " Business ? " " Dad owns a trucking company . We bring fuel into the state , mostly from Oklahoma and Texas . At least we used to . With everything that 's happened , we 're just scraping by . " Jeff explained that he had worked his way up in the family business and now handled the day- to-day operations . " Dad always thought Buck would come back and help us out , but he went away to school and we have n't seen much of him since . He was n't here when Mom died .... " As others left the house , Jeff moved toward the door . " Better get back . Nice talking to you . " " Wait , " Vicki said . " You must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about this church from a guy . This is only my second time . " " Do you have any other family ? " Jeff looked away and took a deep breath . " A wife and two children . They 're gone . " " I 'm so sorry , " Vicki said . " My wife was picking up our kids at a retreat in the mountains . There was an accident . Her car flipped . The state police never found her body , just her clothes . " " The night of thedisappearances ? " Jeff nodded . " They found a late-night snack burning on the stove and a hundred sets of pajamas , but my kids were gone . I took the four-wheel drive up there to see for myself . Then I went to the cabin where all those kids were . " Jeff sat and put his face in his hands . " Thought I was over this . I told Dad I was finally moving on , but hearing you brought it all back . " " What was your wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had our problems before the kids came along . We even split up for a while but got back together after she got religion . She really changed . Losing her and the kids has been the hardest thing I 've ever gone through . " " Have you talked to the pastor here about this ? " Jeff glanced at the man . " Dad would have a fit if he knew I was here . He does n't agree with Buck that we 're not Christians . " " What do you think ? " Jeff looked away . " Your wife and children did n't die that night , " Vicki said . " Buck talked to my dad and told us his theory . " " It 's not a theory . The Bible is coming true all around us every day .... " " At first I thought this whole thing was like the last judgment of God . But if he took all the good people and left the bad ones , why were my dad and me left behind ? What did we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bugs . This ca n't be from God . " " God cares about you , Jeff . He gave his life for you , and now you 've been given a second chance to follow him . " Jeff scowled . " Promise me something . " " What ? " " Do n't ever tell Buck or anybody else that you saw me here . " Vicki glanced at Conrad and Shelly , who seemed to be listening . " We wo n't . But we 'll be here another couple of days . There are answers that you and your father should hear . " Jeff shook his head and walked toward the door . He turned and said , " Leave my dad out of this . " Conrad , Shelly , and the pastor joined Vicki . The pastor said he had seen Jeff only once before . " I tried to talk with him myself , but he slipped out before I had the chance . " " Buck has tried to get through to him , has n't he ? " Conrad said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relationship , " Vicki said . " Maybe we should try to find him and his dad , " Shelly said . The pastor shook his head . " I do n't want to scare him away . Let 's pray and ask God to work on him . " Judd listened as Sam told more about being questioned by the Global Community . Sam did n't know for sure why he had been released , but he thought his father might have been involved . Plus , he had spoken so much about God that many prisoners had believed in Jesus . The most troubling part of Sam 's story was that Nada and her family had been taken into custody . Judd and Lionel pulled Sam aside and asked to hear the whole story . " The guards brought Kasim and Jamal inside and treated them roughly , " Sam said . " Kasim got the worst of it . They put them in separate cells so they would n't be able to talk . Kasim was near me . " " Did Kasim talk with you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be careful . His lip was bloody and he was in a lot of pain . But he whispered that the GC came a few nights ago . Kasim and Nada slipped out a window and thought they had gotten away , but a squad car cornered them in an alley . " " How could the GC have found them ? " Lionel said . " Kweesa , " Judd said . Sam nodded again . " Kasim told me about calling his old girlfriend in New Babylon . He was sure she was the one who gave his family away . They probably traced Kasim 's call . " " Then the GC know who he is , " Judd said . " Kasim thinks they 'll try him as a deserter , " Sam said . " And you can bet the deputy commander recognized Jamal and the rest of the family as soon as he saw them . " Judd put a hand to his forehead . " You 're right . Woodruff was questioning them in the apartment when he got stung . He 'll fry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sam said . " Our only chance is my dad . We should pray for him to believe the truth and then somehow release them . " " There might be another way , " Judd said . Mark Eisman tried calling Vicki throughout the day but did n't connect until late evening . Vicki said the trip to Arizona had been interesting , but she would n't go into detail . " A lot 's been happening here too , " Mark said . " Have you heard the news ? " " What news ? " " They 're starting up school again . " " What school ? " " The Global Community Department of Education made a statement today . They 're setting up satellite schools around the country . I just heard a couple days ago about the final decision . " " Let me guess , " Vicki said . " Carl found out about it in Florida . " " Bingo , " Mark said . " He was going through some top secret GC files and found a memo from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's handpicked by Carpathia for the United North American States . " " What did the memo say ? " " They 've been planning this for a long time , but with each judgment , they 've had to put it off . " " Put what off ? " " Requiring everyone under the age of twenty to go through what they 're calling continuing education . " " Brainwashing , " Vicki said . " Exactly , " Mark said . " There are thousands of sites across the U.S. where they 'll register kids and have them go through training beamed by satellite . " " What are they going to teach ? " Mark pulled up the memo on his computer screen and read parts to Vicki . " We exist to make our students better members of the Global Community . We will teach tolerance and the ideals represented by our leader , Potentate Nicolae Carpathia . " Our hope is to also identify those who might be candidates for our Morale Monitor squad . Each location will be asked to screen students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vicki sighed . " I had hoped after Commander Blancka that the Morale Monitors would end . " " It gets worse , " Mark said . " Listen . Not only will we identify those loyal to our cause , but we will also target those against our goals . Some would like to see the downfall of the Global Community . No doubt they have been brainwashed by parents , friends , or heretics such as Tsion Ben-Judah . Young people who refuse to attend our learning facilities will be rounded up and processed . " " Processed ? " Vicki said . " Like we 're slabs of meat . " " They mean business , " Mark said . " We showed the announcement to everybody here today , and a bunch of unbelievers left . " " Melinda and Janie ? " " No . Janie 's worried about getting sent back to prison . Melinda says she 's waiting until you get back before she decides what to do . " " Then we have to come home right away , " Vicki said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been gone too long . Cancel our other meetings and tell the groups we 'll do our best to reschedule . I need to clear up a couple of things here , and we 'll hopefully make it by the end of the week . " " I 'll tell Melinda , " Mark said . " One more thing . How close is the nearest GC learning center ? " " A few miles from the town where we found Lenore , " Mark said . " Sounds too close , " Vicki said . " If those people who stayed with us rat us out , we 're dead . We need a plan in case the GC come looking . " " I 'm on it , " Mark said . He hung up and wrote e-mails to the groups who had requested teaching from the Young Tribulation Force . He said he hated letting them down , but he hoped they would understand . Lenore sat by Mark and looked over his shoulder . " Maybe having all those people stay with us was n't such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all agreed to take care of them . What we need is a backup plan in case any of them inform the GC about us . Any suggestions ? " Judd closed the bedroom door and huddled with Sam and Lionel . He pulled out a sheet of paper and drew a diagram . " They held me in the same jail . I know how the offices and cells are laid out . Sam , you were just there . If we can figure a way in , I think we can get them out . " Lionel shook his head . " We 've done enough damage . If the GC catch us ... " " Damage ? " Judd said . " If it were you in there , Nada would try to get you out . " " That 's what 's wrong with her . She should n't try that kind of thing . " " I 'm not leaving her in there ! " Judd shouted . Sam started to speak , but the door opened . Mr. Stein walked in and sat on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I do n't blame you . I ca n't imagine what Jamal 's family is going through . But I ca n't let you attempt an escape- " " We have to get them out , " Judd said . " Kasim 's life 's at stake . " " I know that . Allow me to finish . I ca n't let you attempt an escape without my help . " " You 'll help us ? " Sam said . " We must come up with a plan we all agree on , " Mr. Stein said . He looked at Judd and Lionel . " That should be no small task . " They laughed , then spread out several sheets of paper on the bed . They worked until early the next morning . Vicki looked for Jeff the next day but did n't see him . She sped up the teaching and told the participants that she and her friends had to leave that night . When Vicki opened the floor for questions , kids asked about the start-up of the Global Community satellite schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " They could brainwash us , and we 'll lose the mark of the believer . But if we do n't go , they 'll know we 're against the Global Community . " " You do n't have to worry about losing the mark . " Vicki explained that the kids who believe in Jesus are held not by their own power , but by God 's . " Each of you has to make up your own mind . By going you might be able to reach some people who do n't know about God . But it might be too much for you to listen to the GC 's blather . " " What are you going to do ? " another teen said . Vicki glanced at Conrad and Shelly . " I 'd like to ask you all to pray for us as we head back tonight . We have to resolve some issues about the place we 're staying and some people we 've taken in . " Kids stood and held hands . The pastor led them in a prayer and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Other kids prayed simple prayers and thanked God for bringing Vicki and the others to help them learn . As they were praying , the door opened . Vicki looked up and noticed Jeff Williams slip into the back of the room . When they were finished , Vicki walked up to him . " I 'm glad you came back . " " What you said makes sense , but I 'm not sure I can believe it . " " Why ? " Jeff frowned . " It would mean Buck was right . " He sat and leaned back in his chair . Shelly , Conrad , and the pastor joined them . " I 'm ticked off at Buck right now . I mean , I 'm proud of him and everything . He 's accomplished a lot . But he did n't even come to Sharon and the kids ' memorial service . " Vicki started to speak , but Jeff held up a hand . " I know he was probably busy with a story or something . I also know I should n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't do . " The pastor leaned forward . " Jeff , you know the truth now . You were left behind because you did n't have a true relationship with God like your wife did . Give your heart to God right now . " Jeff stood . " I need more time . " " I understand , " the pastor said . " But do n't wait too long . We do n't know how many will make it through the next judgment . " Jeff turned to Vicki . " You promised not to tell my brother or anybody else that you saw me here . " Vicki nodded . She felt bad as she watched Jeff leave . She wanted him to pray right then and bring his father to the church . But she knew no one could make the decision for Jeff . He had to make it himself . Before they left , the pastor gave the kids some extra food to take on their trip . Since the man 's computer had been destroyed in the earthquake , Conrad suggested they let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's phone rang . " I just heard from Carl , " Mark said . " Are you sitting down ? " " Just tell me . " " Remember the guy who helped you out in Tennessee ? " " Omer ? " " Yeah . He and a bunch of others from Johnson City stormed the GC prison to try and rescue the believers . " " Is he- ? " " The GC killed most of them . Omer 's gone , Vick . " Vicki slid to the floor . Shelly knelt beside her and put a hand on her shoulder . " The worst part is that the GC were getting ready to release Omer 's mom . Carl said if they had waited a few more days , everything would have been all right . "
