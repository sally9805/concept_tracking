A Package Like a Dumpling As a rule , Ginny Blackstone tried to go unnoticed -- something that was more or less impossible with thirty pounds ( she 'd weighed it ) of purple-and-green backpack hanging from her back . She did n't want to think about all the people she 'd bumped into while she 'd been carrying it . This thing was not made for wearing around New York City . Well , anywhere , really . . . but especially the East Village of New York City on a balmy June afternoon . And a chunk of her hair was caught under the strap on her right shoulder , so her head was also being pulled down a little . That did n't help . It had been over two years since Ginny had last been to the 4th Noodle Penthouse . ( Or " that place above the grease factory , " as Ginny 's parents preferred to refer to it . It was n't entirely unfair . 4th Noodle was pretty greasy . But it was the good kind of greasy , and they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ map had faded a bit in the last two years , but 4th Noodle 's name also contained its address . It was on 4th Street and Avenue A. The alphabet avenues were east of the numbers , deeper into the super-trendy East Village -- where people smoked and wore latex and never shuffled down the street with bags the size ofmailboxes strapped to their backs . She could just see it now . . . the unassuming noodle shop next to Pavlova 's Tarot ( with the humming purple neon sign ) , just across the street from the pizza place with the giant mural of a rat on the side . There was a tiny tinkle of a chime and a sharp blast of air-conditioning as Ginny opened the door . Standing behind the counter was a pixie of a woman manning three phones at once . This was Alice , the owner , and Aunt Peg 's favorite neighbor . She smiled broadly when she saw Ginny and held up a finger , indicating that she should wait . " Ginny , " Alice said , hanging up two of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Peg . " She disappeared through a bamboo curtain that covered a door into the back . Alice was Chinese , but she spoke perfect English ( Aunt Peg had told her so ) . But because she always had to get right to the point ( 4th Noodle did a brisk business ) , she spoke in halting single words . Nothing had changed since the last time Ginny had been here . She looked up at the illuminated pictures of Chinese food , the shiny plastic visions of sesame shrimp and chicken and broccoli . They glowed , not quite tantalizingly , more radioactively . The chicken pieces were a little too glossy and orange . The sesame seeds too white and too large . The broccoli was so green it seemed to vibrate . There was the blown-up and framed picture of Rudy Giuliani standing with a glowing Alice , taken when he had shown up one day . It was the smell , though , that was most familiar . The heavy , fatty smell of sizzling beef and pork and peppers and the sweetish odor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that seeped through Aunt Peg 's floor and perfumed her . It rang such a chord in Ginny 's memory that she almost swung her head around to see if Aunt Peg was standing there behind her . But , of course , she could n't be . " Here , " Alice said , emerging from the beaded curtain with a brown paper package in her hand . " For Ginny . " The package -- an overstuffed padded brown envelope -- was indeed addressed to her , Virginia Blackstone , care of Alice at 4th Noodle , New York City . It was postmarked from London and had the faintest aura of grease . " Thanks , " Ginny said , accepting the package as gracefully as she could , given that she could n't lean over without falling face-first onto the counter . " Say hi to Peg for me , " Alice said , picking up the phone and launching straight into an order . " Right . . . " Ginny nodded . " Um , sure . " Once she was out on the street , scanning Avenue A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail for herself , Ginny wondered if she should have told Alice what had happened . But she was soon distracted by the sheer terror that her task caused her . Cabs were yellow beasts that sped through New York , whisking people who had to be places to the places they had to be and leaving terrified pedestrians scrambling for cover . No , she thought , raising a timid hand as far as she could as a herd of her prey suddenly appeared . There was no reason to tell Alice what had happened . She barely believed it herself . And besides , she had to go . Continues ...
