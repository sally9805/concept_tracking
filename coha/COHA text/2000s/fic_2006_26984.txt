Decision : No brainer . Living with a stranger has got to be better than living with Mom and Sarah while The Wedding is being planned . I do n't have to ride the big roller coasters . It 's only three months . True love can survive that , ca n't it ? And that 's how I , Megan Holloway , a life-in-the-slow-lane , carousel-ride type of girl , packed up the essentials of my life following my junior year in high school and headed to the Thrill Ride ! Amusement Park , vacation destination extraordinaire on Lake Erie . That afternoon I 'd flown into the airport . With my backpack dangling off one shoulder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area outside the main terminal . An impossible-to-miss bright red Thrill Ride ! shuttle bus was parked nearby , motor running . So I headed over to it and peered in the door . " Going my way ? " I asked the driver . He was n't exactly what I was expecting . White-haired , wrinkled , slightly hunched . Still , he laughed and climbed out of the bus . " You here for the summer ? " he asked . " Yep . " He wore a red shirt , cargo shorts , and his name tag read pete ( santa fe , nm ) . " You from Santa Fe ? " I asked . " Before I retired . Got tired of playing golf so came up here to work . Being around young people keeps me young . " He took my suitcase and put it in a holding bay at the back of the bus . " Climb aboard , " he said . I settled onto a seat . I heard laughter and two other girls clambered onto the bus . " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other chirped . " Hi . " Not exactly an original response , and maybe part of the reason that our conversation did n't last longer . They sat in front of me and immediately started talking to each other like long-lost friends . Pete returned to the driver 's seat , closed the bus door , and headed away from the airport . I figured the two girls were returning summer employees . Maybe a little older than me . Definitely friends . They were giggling , talking , and screeching periodically . I looked out the window , trying really hard not to feel ignored and lonely . I so did not want to be lonely . I was already missing Nick . We 'd only been dating for three months , and he was totally bummed that I 'd applied for a job at the park , and even more bummed that I 'd been hired to work there for the entire summer . " That sucks , " he 'd said . Not exactly what I 'd wanted to hear when I told him . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean , a thousand people had probably applied . I 'd had to fill out an extensive application and submit an essay about the reasons that I wanted to work there . And I 'd gotten in just under the wire on the minimum age requirement of seventeen . My birthday was yesterday . So I 'd been feeling pretty good about myself when I received the letter telling me that I 'd been hired . After I 'd shared my good news with Nick , he 'd moped around most of the evening . I 'd shown him a video of the amusement park that my dad had ordered for me . My dad is really into watching the Travel Channel , so he was the one who discovered Thrill Ride ! and told me about it . It sounded like it would be an awesome experience . But Nick was less than impressed with the rides , the park , and all the facilities that the tour guide on the video walked us through . The video was geared toward enticing teens to come work there and making parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were dorm moms and curfews and all kinds of safety features . " It 's just the same as Six Flags , " he 'd said . " You could have worked there over the summer , commuted from home , and been a lot closer to me . " " It 's not the same . It 's the thrill ride capital of the world . It 's in another state . I want to live away from home . I 'll be more independent . On my own . Or pretty much on my own . I mean , I 'll live in a park-sponsored dorm , but gosh , Nick , no parents . " I 'd tried to talk Nick into applying , so we 'd be together , but since he worked at Hart 's Diner during the school year , he did n't feel like he could leave for the summer and expect to have a job when he got back . I admired his dedication , and totally understood his reasoning , even if I was a little hurt because it showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything to him about it , because I figured he could argue that my not hanging around . . .
