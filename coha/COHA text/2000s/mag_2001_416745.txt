Bonding on and off the playground , Dr. Howard Stevenson of the University of Pennsylvania and his son , Bryan , create new family traditions . // THE struggle to raise African-American males in American society hit Dr. Pearlman Hicks 10 years ago when his then-11-year-old son , Timothy , brought home a report card full of D 's . Timothy , once an A-student , had become angry and unresponsive , his father says , and was " hanging around kids who were just hanging out and smoking pot . " Timothy 's behavior hid a deeper pain . For when Dr. Hicks , wife , Cheryl , lost her bout with breast cancer in 1991 , Timothy became enraged , and his younger brother , Stephen , went into denial , carrying a picture of his mother in his wallet . All this left Dr. Hicks , an often  --  busy father with a successful plastic surgery practice in Beverly Hills , Calif. , struggling to raise his sons through an emotional period . " Before my wife got sick , I did n't spend enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year-old Palos Verdes resident . " But when my wife died , I realized that I needed to be there . And I think it 's paid off . " Dr. Hicks became an attentive father , cooking breakfast in the morning , helping Timothy with his homework , and taking the boys to their after-school athletic practices . Through their local church , Hicks found a network of people to help him . And it did pay off . Both Timothy and Stephen now attend college . " That was a strange reversal , " Dr. Hicks says . " Surgeons and men , we ca n't show emotion . And we were crying with one another at night . The boys saw me in a different light . " The Hicks family is a good example of how parents can raise African-American sons to be healthy and safe . With the number of obstacles they confront  --  from the dangers of drugs , gangs and other criminal elements to still  --  prevalent forms of institutionalized racism such as racial profiling  --  young African-American boys face harrowing times . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Method : A Program for Rearing Healthy Black Boys , " Thirty-two percent of African  --  American males between the ages of 20 and 29 are in contact with the criminal justice system . " But according to Winbush and many others , young African-American males can be raised into intelligent , confident men with a strong sense of racial pride . " Outside the doors of our homes , it 's like an obstacle course , " says Minister Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad , chief of staff for the Nation of Islam and father of an 18-year-old son , Leonard Jr . " But you have to be wise in the way you choose your friends . You have to be wise in the way you decide where you 're going to go . All of these areas can lead to problems for you if you do n't make good choices . " In order to raise healthy sons , parents must establish a secure and comfortable home for their boys , and then educate them on how to conduct themselves as men , says Dr. Nancy Boyd-Franklin , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and co-author of Boys Into Men : Raising our African-American Teenage Sons , with her husband , Dr. A.J. Franklin . " Our children get labeled at a very early age , " Dr. Boyd-Franklin says . " And we ... support parents to be very proactive in the raising and the advocating of their sons . " Most agree that raising a son in a two-parent home is preferable to the single-parent dynamic , although strong Black parents , and mothers in particular , have raised some of our greatest men and women . African-American boys should have an example to follow , says Roland Warren , executive vice president of the National Fatherhood Initiative . Warren , the father of teenage boys , says that his sons learned how to interact with others by watching his example . But this is not happening in many African-American households , Warren says . Roughly 63 percent of all Black kids grow up in single-parent households , according to Warren . " A number of Black boys growing up do n't have as much interaction with their fathers as they should . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , the best thing a man can do is stay connected with his kids or be married to a kid 's mother . " But because this dynamic is not always possible , single parents must have a network of supportive friends and family , Dr. Boyd  --  Franklin says . " Single parents can very effectively raise African  --  American male children , " she says . " Single parents have been raising our sons for generations , but the secret is for the parent to have his or her support . " Dr. Hicks found help at the local church , where members of the congregation would make dinner or baby-sit . Dr. Hicks was surprised one day to find Stephen leading prayer groups . " We needed something that could help , " he says . " When things get so bad and you do n't know who to turn to , there was God . " Photograph Father-and-son chat is a regular ritual for Minister Leonard Farrakhan Muhammad and his 18-year-old son , Leonard Jr . Minister Muhammad says maintaining respect and authority is the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also need to understand how to handle racist encounters , Dr. Boyd-Franklin says . Because of upward mobility , many African-American parents have forgotten that their children are still targets for racial abuse . " A lot of African-American parents have a fantasy that their zip code is going to save their child , " Dr. Boyd Franklin says . " We need to prepare our kids for various kinds of racial profiling . Concepts like , If you are stopped by police , do not run . Do not overreact . ' ' " Anger is another problem parents must help their sons control , says Dr. Howard Stevenson , a clinical child psychologist at the University of Pennsylvania and father of a 10-year-old biracial son , Bryan . As director of the Prevention of Long-Term Anger and Aggression in Youth program in Philadelphia , Dr. Stevenson works with so-called " problem " children . Dr. Stevenson says that activities like basketball and martial arts help children release their anger . With this program , Dr. Stevenson uses basketball to push his students to the point of fighting , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also uses those principles with his son , who he co-raises with his ex-wife , Elenita . Parents must also discipline their sons in a strong-but-compassionate manner . The discipline instills order and structure while consideration of their feelings will help children see parents as more than just disciplinarians . The idea is to create a close bond with your son that also incorporates authority and respect , Minister Muhammad says . " They either find it at home or find it outside of the home , and most parents would prefer that children find friendship at home , " the minister says . " Sometimes when there 's a problem , you want to talk to your friend , not your father . It 's a good idea to develop ... a sense of brotherhood as men . " It 's good to establish this bond early with African-American boys in order to help them deal with feelings of peer pressure , stress and rebelliousness , Dr. Boyd  --  Franklin says . " Teenagers rebel against everything , " she says . " But if they have a good basis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more likely to survive those years intact . " But most importantly , parents must instill a sense of racial pride and identity in their sons . Because of the negative impressions American society has of young African  --  American males , parents must be proactive by accentuating the positive , telling their sons what is right about them , and telling them how proud of them you are . By preparing their sons beforehand , instilling pride and arming them with knowledge , African-American parents can turn these boys into successful men . <p>
