When Houston is hit by a sudden storm , the city may be partly to blame . Increasingly , urban centers do n't merely endure bad weather ; they help create it . Researchers believe the phenomenon may be more common now than ever before . <P> Scientists have known for 200 years that the temperature in a city can be higher than that in its environs  --  something they learned when an amateur weather watcher detected a 1.58F temperature difference between London and its suburbs . Modern cities , with their cars and heat-trapping buildings , can create an even bigger temperature gap , sometimes as much as 10F . <P> Islands of urban heat can do funny things with weather . Hot city air , like hot air anywhere else , rises  --  even more so because of the turbulence caused by tall buildings . When that air is damp enough and collides with colder layers above it , water can condense out as a sudden burst of rain , especially if there are few frontal systems to disrupt the layers , as in summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it , it 's likely that nature alone is n't behind the downpour . <P> NASA and the University of Arkansas have been using satellite mapping and ground-based temperature readings to determine how widespread this phenomenon is . This spring researchers got a surprise when they turned their attention to Houston . Because it 's near a coast and sea breezes tend to cool and disperse hot air , Houston was thought to be comparatively safe from homemade rain . Now it appears that the opposite may be true . " The sea breeze may exacerbate the rainfall , " says research meteorologist Marshall Shepherd of NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center . The warm air and sea air collide , he explains , and " move straight up like the front ends of two cars that hit head on , providing a pump of moist air that helps thunderstorms develop . " <P> Hot , waterlogged cities can be cooled off in the usual ways  --  by limiting auto exhaust , for example . Using light-colored roofing and paving materials in place of black , heat-absorbing tar will also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reduce the need for air conditioning .  --  By Jeffrey Kluger
