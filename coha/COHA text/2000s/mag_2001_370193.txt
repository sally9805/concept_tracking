It was bright but cool in the backyard of the Duck Pond preschool in Oakland , Calif.  --  perfect climbing weather . So Chloe Fillinger pulled herself to the top of the play structure , where she reached for the fire fighter 's pole , her three-year-old body poised for a fast ride to the bottom . Her hand flailed in empty space . " Cynthia ! " she called to her teacher . " The pole is gone ! " <P> Across the country , school fire fighter 's poles are falling to hacksaws . Day-care-center swings are tumbling into trash bins . Parks are losing their seesaws , churches their jungle gyms , housing developments their slides . Whole playgrounds have closed , all because safety regulators have raised their standards higher than many owners can afford to reach . <P> Concerns about safe playgrounds are not new ; the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission first published guidelines in 1981 . But the rules have gradually become stricter , and in recent years , courts , insurance companies and state governments have given these rules the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year requiring wheelchair access to climbing structures , some playground operators ca n't afford to replace what they have removed . Says City College of New York environmental psychologist Roger Hart : " I think it 's gone too far . " <P> For sure , there are play structures that are unsafe . Many built before the 1970s were little more than steel towers over bare asphalt . " A lot of the playgrounds we grew up on were really kind of instruments of torture , " says Kathryn Dresslar , a legislative aide who helped bring about new California regulations . In 1999 , according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission , a quarter of a million American kids went from playgrounds to emergency rooms . <P> Even without the new regulations , some playground operators could see that changes were needed . " There were horrible metal pieces and concrete that could cut our children , " says Judy Davidson , who successfully lobbied to have climbing equipment removed from Community Elementary School 236 , where she teaches in the Bronx , N.Y . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unable to replace what a bulldozer demolished in a few minutes . " You know how important it is for them to have a place to climb and play , " she laments . <P> And therein lies one of the biggest problems for many parks , schools and churches . A medium-size structure that fully complies with federal guidelines costs around $100,000 . Adding to the price are new regulations , issued in October 2000 under the Americans with Disabilities Act , requiring that at least half of every playground be accessible to children in wheelchairs . <P> Even if they had the money , many small churches and day-care centers do n't have the space . The guidelines require that swings be set apart from any other structure , with a clearance both in front and back equal to twice the height of the swings , and 6 ft. of clearance on either side . That 's most of the space in some private playgrounds . And since a wheelchair ramp must be 12 ft. long for every foot in height , it is practically impossible for some playgrounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level .
