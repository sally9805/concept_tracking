<p> FOR the small group of economists and policy wonks interested in applying supply-and-demand theories to the thorny problems of gridlock and ever-longer commutes , the $2.9 trillion fiscal 2008 budget released by President Bush on Monday contained some excellent news : $130 million in grants to finance construction of so-called congestion pricing systems . <p> Congestion pricing  --  the concept of charging higher fees to consumers for a good or a service at times of heavy use  --  is well established in businesses like hotels , long-distance phone service and air travel . And while London and Stockholm have successfully enacted plans that levy fees on drivers who want to enter traffic-clogged city streets , the United States has been slow to apply the concept on the roads . When Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg proposed last year that New York look into congestion pricing as a means of unclogging the city 's famously clogged roadways , he was roundly criticized . <p> Actually , congestion pricing was born and bred in New York City . William Vickrey , the longtime Columbia University economist and 1996 Nobel laureate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1959 , long before E-ZPass was a twinkle in a planner 's eye , Mr. Vickrey proposed that cities could reduce traffic by using electronic systems to charge drivers for the privilege of nosing their sedans into urban grids . <p> Advances in technology and the successful experiments in Europe and the United States lead many economists to view the present as an ideal time to apply the theory to traffic control . Since February 2003 , when London introduced a system that charged a fee to motorists entering the central city on weekdays , " congestion has been reduced noticeably , " said Edward L. Glaeser , professor of economics at Harvard . " People are using the roads less , and there have been remarkable upticks in speeds . " <p> Beyond that , congestion pricing holds out the possibility of harnessing people 's innate economic rationality and self-interest in order to promote a series of public goods . Every time a driver turns onto the Henry Hudson Parkway , she slows down the travel speed of all the other drivers , imposing a cost  --  or , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow citizens . " Everybody wants fewer people to drive , and everybody wants people to use less gas , " said Gregory L. Rosston , deputy director of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research in Palo Alto , Calif . <p> But so far , high gas prices and concerns about emissions have n't led Americans to alter their driving patterns significantly . By making people take into account the true cost of driving  --  beyond gasoline , insurance and lease payments  --  congestion pricing in theory encourages people to car-pool , or to drive at different times of the day , or to take the train or bus . <p> There are a few congestion-pricing experiments in the United States today . On a portion of California Route 91 , in Orange County , drivers can choose between the free road and the less-traveled pay-per-drive adjacent lanes , in which tolls vary throughout the day and throughout the week . Driving eastbound in the express lanes at 4 p.m . Thursday costs $9.25 , compared with $1.85 at noon the same day . To the south , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , high-occupancy toll , or H.O.T. , lanes can be used by individual motorists willing to pay fees that vary throughout the day , depending on traffic conditions . <p> Some number of travelers will always be willing to pay a price to save several minutes , while others would rather save a few dollars and take the chance of being stuck in traffic . " People are willing to pay for that time savings , and the price can be adjusted in such a way that you keep the lanes pretty full but do n't become overloaded , " said Kenneth Small , research professor of economics at the University of California , Irvine . " You can almost always drive in the express lanes without slowing down , free flow . " In San Diego , the price of using the H.O.T . lanes can change every six minutes . <p> The greater willingness of drivers and policy makers to consider congestion pricing is a recognition that building more roads will never be a solution to traffic problems . <p> " In many areas , it 's extremely hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winston , an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington . <p> Today , variations of congestion pricing are in effect on stretches of highway in Houston , Minneapolis and Denver . The success of experiments and the new funding lead advocates like Mr. Winston to conclude that " these H.O.T . lanes are just the tip of the iceberg . " <p> THERE 'S reason to think that we could be entering a golden age for congestion pricing . The transportation secretary , Mary E. Peters , is an advocate of the practice . Beyond the $130 million in this year 's budget to help states and cities build congestion-pricing road systems , the Bush administration has signaled support for legislation that would use congestion pricing to encourage airlines to spread their flights more evenly throughout the day . What 's more , the technology that enables operators of complex systems to adjust prices can facilitate congestion pricing in electricity and parking meters . <p> But introducing congestion pricing on a wider scale will mean overcoming powerful cultural and psychological obstacles . <p> " Everyone accepts that if your car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Alexander Tabarrok , professor of economics at George Mason University . " But if you tell people they have to pay to move their car between two points , they think it 's crazy . " <p> The notion of charging people for a good or service generally regarded as free  --  driving on highways  --  also instills political opposition . In New York , many elected officials argued that charging fees to drivers would be a burden for poor and middle-income people . <p> Professor Glaeser disagrees . <p> " The greatest beneficiaries of reduced congestion on roads in New York would be people who ride buses to get to and from work , who would find their commutes shortened .
