<p> CHOCOLATE has developed a peculiar aftertaste . <p> It is n't the flavor I find odd ; it 's the fetish . The " death by chocolate " desserts and " decadent " chocolate truffles , the " indulgent " chocolate-scented spa treatments and overly intense T-shirt slogans ( " I am a woman of many moods  --  and all of them need chocolate " ) . <p> Chocolate , a perfectly delicious food , is now saddled with this heavy-breathing reputation . For the home cook , this means built-in performance anxiety . In search of chocolate desserts new and astonishing I have peeled hazelnuts , strained custards , whipped egg whites , and attacked innocent bars of chocolate with a chisel . <p> And then , a couple of years ago , for the first time since elementary school , I made a batch of brownies . I was thunderstruck by how easy they were  --  and how effectively the modest brownie showcased the quality of fine chocolate , high-fat butter and even artisanal sugar . " There is n't much to them , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Baking : From My Home to Yours , " includes 12 different brownie recipes . " But when they 're done right , you really ca n't beat them . " <p> Since my epiphany , I have always had an elegant chocolate dessert to fall back on . Today 's brownies , from brilliant pastry minds like Ms. Greenspan , Nick Malgieri and Alice Medrich , bear little resemblance to the tough bake-sale squares of yore : they contain much more chocolate and less flour . Sheila Brass is a culinary historian who , with her sister , Marilynn , wrote " Heirloom Baking With the Brass Sisters " in 2006 , which traces the evolution of American baking in the 20th century through their own family history . <p> " Our father loved the Bangor brownies , " Ms. Brass said . Some legends place the first brownies in Bangor , Me . The classic recipe , dating to the early 1900s , calls for just two ounces of chocolate . To a modern palate , that amount is practically imperceptible . Older recipes reflect the ingredients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still new , exotic and relatively expensive . The first American chocolate factories were concentrated in New England , and it was there that the brownie first caught the public imagination , in the 1920s . <p> In later decades , the chocolate level in brownies climbed . The Brass sisters , whom Sheila describes collectively as " roundish and 60-ish , " learned to bake from their parents , who were married in 1934 . " Then , when we were sweet young things out on our own in the ' 60s and ' 70s , we started adding more chocolate and more butter to the recipe , " she said . <p> The 1970s marked the beginning of the chocolate cult ; the term " chocoholic " came into vogue , and the " Cathy " comic strip picked up the thread in the 1980s with endless jokes about chocolate cravings , feeding the image of women  --  especially lonely single women  --  with a weakness for the stuff . ( I can think of plenty of ' 80s trends that have n't aged well  --  roasted garlic , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intersects so unpalatably with sexual politics . ) The ' 80s also brought culture-of-excess creations like the Barefoot Contessa 's Outrageous Brownie and the fudge-frosted Chocolate Orgasm at Rosie 's Bakery in Cambridge , Mass . <p> What is a brownie ? Certainly it 's one of the few truly American baking creations to enter the canon  --  like the blueberry muffin and the chocolate chip cookie . Beyond that , there is no clear point of origin . Most brownie legends begin with an absentminded housewife : stripped down to its essence , a brownie is just a chocolate cake without the baking powder . Although some " cakey " recipes include it , a brownie with baking powder is not really a brownie . " Leavening is about as useful in brownies as it is in mashed potatoes , " Nick Malgieri said . <p> In my opinion , the charge of pointless excess also applies to marshmallows , peanut butter , chipotle powder , orange marmalade , cream cheese and most other frills and furbelows . If you feel compelled to tinker , consider upgrading your ingredients instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Callebaut chocolate and loamy muscovado sugar from the island of Mauritius . Walnuts are fine . Pecans are pushing it . <p> The ideal modern brownie is simple and unadorned , but rigorously designed ( like a Diane Von Furstenberg wrap dress ) . Whether the brownie sits on the fudgy or the cakey side of the aisle , its character should come from the underlying structure of flour , sugar , butter , eggs and chocolate , not from shoveling in more fillings , or from deliberate underbaking . ( Many recipes recommend this for a fudgy texture , but fudgy and wet are not the same thing . ) <p> According to Shirley O. Corriher , the food scientist whose book " BakeWise " promises to end all baking arguments when it is published next year , brownie variations are mostly based on the proportions of fat and flour  --  and also , crucially , on how long the eggs are beaten . " It 's the little things that matter in baking , " she said . " Everyone is obsessed with that crackly , crinkly crust on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get that if you do n't beat the eggs . But if you do n't beat the eggs , you have to get your lift from somewhere else , do n't you ? " <p> Fortunately , civilian bakers do not have to master the technicalities . Good brownie recipes abound , and all you have to do is follow them . For a soft , light , buttery brownie , I like Dorie Greenspan 's French Chocolate Brownie ; for a brownie almost as dark and dense as a chocolate truffle , there is Alice Medrich 's innovative method for New Classic Brownies : the pan goes directly from a high-heat oven to a bath of ice water , and the just-baked batter slumps , becoming concentrated and intense . <p> However , I would maintain that the best of both worlds is achieved only by the Supernatural Brownie , the one that made me a convert . It is an accidental creation by Mr. Malgieri , who ( in a rare human moment for a pastry chef ) once forgot to double the flour when baking his own fudge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar to the basic formula . The experts are divided as to whether the brown sugar actually contributes flavor or simply makes the brownie moister ( molasses , which makes brown sugar brown , is powerfully hydrophilic ) . It 's my belief that the slightly bitter taste of molasses acts as an invisible enhancer to the chocolate . The result is as complex and sophisticated as any terrine or truffle I have ever produced . <p> Perhaps the surest sign of the elevated status of the brownie is that it is now taken seriously by French pastry chefs . " Herme was quite determined to master the brownie , " said Ms. Greenspan , who lives part time in Paris and worked with the celebrated pastry chef Pierre Herme on his book " Chocolate Desserts . " " It 's hip to make things that are considered ' not French , ' although I would argue that the brownie actually has a French ancestor , a simple chocolate cake called fondant that is one of the few things the French actually bake at home . " ( A magnificently dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brownie sold at Pain Quotidien bakeries . ) <p> " American-style " coffee shops began showing up in Paris about a decade ago ( finally making it possible to get a cup of coffee to go ) and " les brownies , " along with " les coukies " and " le crumble , " became instantly fashionable . <p> However , it seems that there are certain cultural and culinary barricades to authenticity . " French brownies remain depressingly hard and dry , and tooneat : no crumbly edges , no rough surfaces , " reported a Paris-based American friend I sent on a scouting trip . She found one brownie that almost passed muster , but decided that the hazelnuts  --  a very French addition  --  were excessively big and too rich . " As the French say , " she wrote , " C'est too much .
