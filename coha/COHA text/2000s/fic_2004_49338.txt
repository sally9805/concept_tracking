Matt Hughes is the author of two novels , Fools Errant and Fool Me Twice , and his third novel , Black Brillion , is due out this summer . he has a Web site at http : // **27;2023;TOOLONG it is revealed that he was bom in Liverpool but has lived in Canada since the age of five . These days he lives in British Columbia . All three of his novels , as well as the story that follows ( and , indeed , most of his work ) , is set in the penultimate age of Old Earth , one eon before Jack Vance 's Dying Earth . It 's an interesting time , and we hope you enjoy meeting Old Earth " s foremost freelance discriminator , Henghis Hapthorn , since we 'll be bringing you more stories about him in months to come . <p> I HAD ALMOST FINISHED unraveling the innermost workings of a moderately interesting conspiracy to defraud one of Olkney 's oldest investment syndicates when suddenly I no longer understood what I was doing . The complex scheme was based @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some small ; some honest , some corrupt - conducted among an elaborate web of persons , some of whom were real , some fictitious , and a few who were both , depending upon the evolving needs of the conspirators . Disentangling the fraud , sifting the actual from the invented , had occupied most of the morning . But once the true shape of the scheme became clear , I again fell prey to the boredom that blighted my days . Then , as I regarded the schematic of the conspiracy on the inner screen of my mind , turning it this way and that , a kind of gray haze descended on my thoughts , like mist thickening on a landscape , first obscuring then obliterating the image . I must be fatigued was my initial reaction . I crossed to my workroom sink and splashed water onto my face , then blotted it dry with a square of absorbent fiber . When I glanced into the reflector I received a shock . " Integrator , " I said aloud , " what has happened to me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied the device , " so a great many events have occurred since your conception . Shall I list them chronologically or in order of importance ? " I have always maintained that clarity of speech precedes clarity of thought and had trained my assistant to respond accordingly . Now I said , " I was speaking colloquially . Examine my appearance . It has changed radically , and not at all for the better . " I looked at myself in the reflector . I should have been seeing the image of Henghis Hapthorn , foremost freelance discriminator in the city of Olkney in the penultimate age of Old Earth . That image traditionally offered a broad brow , a straight nose leading to well formed lips , and a chin that epitomized resolution . Instead , the reflector offered a beetling strip of forehead above a proboscis that went on far too long and in two distinct directions . My upper lip had shrunk markedly while the lower had grown hugely pendulous . My chin , apparently horrified , had fallen back toward my throat . Previously clear sweeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warts and moles . " You seem to have become ugly , " said the integrator . I put my fingers to my face and received from their survey the same unhappy tale told by my eyes . " It is more than seeming , " I said . " It is fact . The question is : how was this done ? " The integrator said , " The first question is not how but exactly what has been done . We also need to learn why and perhaps by whom . The answers to those questions may well have a bearing on finding a way to undo the effect . " " You are right , " said I. " Why did n't I think of that ? " " Are you being colloquial again or do you wish me to speculate ? " I scratched my head . " I am trying to think , " I said . " I have never known you to have to try , " said the integrator . " Normally , you must make an effort to stop . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both its breadth and depth . As a discriminator I often uncovered facts and relationships so ingeniously hidden or disguised as to baffle the best agents of the Archonate 's Bureau of Scrutiny . My cerebral apparatus was powerful and highly tuned . Yet now it was as if some gummy substance had been poured over gears that had always spun without friction . " Something is wrong , " I said . " Moments ago I was a highly intelligent and eminently attractive man in the prime of life . Now I am ugly and dull . " " I dispute the " eminently attractive . " You were , however , presentable . Now , persons who came upon you unexpectedly would be startled . " I disdained to quibble ; the esthetic powers of integrators were notoriously scant . " I was without question the most brilliant citizen of Olkney . " The integrator offered no contradiction . " Now I must struggle even to .... " I broke off for a moment to rummage through my mind , and found conditions worse than I had thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to struggle to compute fourth-level consistencies , but in truth I find it difficult to encompass the most elementary ratios . " " That is very bad . " My face sank into my hands . Its new topography made it strange to my touch . " I am ruined , " I said . " How can I work ? " Integrators were not supposed to experience exasperation , but mine had been with me for so long that certain aspects of my personality had infiltrated its circuits . " Perhaps I should think for both of us , " it said . " Please do . " But scarcely had the device begun to outline a research program than there came an interruption . " I am receiving an emergency message from the fiduciary pool , " it said . " The payment you ordered made from your account to Bastieno 's for the new surveillance suite can not go forward . " " Why not ? " " Insufficient funds . The pool also advises that tomorrow 's automatic payment of the encumbrance on these premises can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had made a substantial deposit two days earlier , the proceeds of a discrimination concerning the disappearance of Hongsaun Bedwicz . She had been custodian of the Archonate 's premier collection of thunder gems , rare objects created when lightning struck through specific layers of certain gaseous planets . They had to be collected within seconds of being formed , lest they sink to lower levels of the chemically active atmosphere and dissolve . I had located Bedwicz on a planet halfway down the Spray , where she had fled with her secret lover , Follis Duhane , whose love of fine things had overstrained her income . My fee should have been the standard ten percent of the value of the recovered goods , but the Archonate 's bureaucrats had made reference to my use of some legally debatable methodologies , and I had come away with three percent . Still , there should be at least 30,000 hepts , I informed my assistant . " My records concur , " said the integrator . " Unfortunately , the pool 's do not . They say you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less . " " Where has the rest of it gone ? " " Pool integrators are never sophisticated , lest they grow bored with constant ins and outs and begin to amuse themselves with the customers " assets . This one merely counts what is there and records inflow and outtake . Yesterday the funds were present . Now they are not , although there has been no authorized withdrawal . " " So now I am not only ugly and dull , but have scarcely a groat to my name and am at risk of being ejected into the street . " The integrator said nothing . " Well , " I prompted it , " have you no empathy ? " " You assembled me from analytical and computative elements , " it replied . " However , I believe I can feign sympathy , if that will help . " " I doubt it , " I said . " Why do n't you analyze something ? " But instead it told me , " I am receiving another urgent message . " I groaned . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would place an appropriate crown onto the morning 's disasters . " " It is Grier Alfazzian , the celebrated entertainer , " said the integrator . " Shall I connect ? " " No . " " He may wish to engage you . An urgent matter would presuppose a willingness to pay an advance . That would solve one of the morning 's problems . " " Hmmm , " I said . " I should have thought of that . " " Yes , " it said , then after a pause , " you poor little lumpykins . " " All right , put him through . But audio only . I do n't want to be seen like this . " " Very well . " " And no more attempts at sympathy . " A screen appeared in the air before me , but when Alfazzian connected I did not see the face that gave women the hot swithers , though I had always thought him more pretty than handsome . he spoke from behind a montage of images that recalled his most acclaimed roles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognized his plummy baritone . " It is , " I said . " I have a question that requires an answer . Urgently and most discreetly . Come to my home at once . " I did not wish to take my new countenance out into the teeming streets of Olkney . There was a bylaw forbidding the frightening of children . " Can we not discuss it as we are ? " " No . " " Very well . " I had a mask left over from a recent soiree at the Archon 's Palace . " But summoning me on short notice requires an advance on my fee . " " How much ? " Fortunately my memory was not fully impaired . I could recall the amounts cadged from wealthy clients who called me for assistance from within the coils of drastic and unexpected predicaments . " Five thousand hepts , " I said . " You may transfer it to my account at once . " " I shall , " he said . " Wait while my integrator conducts the transfer . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Alfazzian striking poses in theatrical costumes and romantic settings . Then his voice returned to say , " There seems to be a problem with my finances . " " Indeed ? " I said . I recalled that I often said " Indeed , " when I could not think of any other rejoinder . When I wished to avoid a question , I usually indicated that an answer would be premature . I found that the two rejoinders filled conversational holes quite nicely . " I do not have five thousand hepts at the moment . My funds have apparently been misplaced , except for a trifling sum . " Some stirring in the back of my mind urged me to ask the exact amount of the trifling sum . " Why do you wish to know ? " Alfazzian said . I did not know why I wished to know , so I said , " It would be premature to say . " " The amount is thirty-two hepts and fourteen grimlets , " he said . " Indeed . " " Are the numbers significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say , " I said . " I will call you back . " " It can not be coincidence that his funds and yours have been reduced to the same amount , " the integrator said . " Why not ? " " Consider the odds . " My mind attempted to do so in its customary manner , lunging at the calculation like a fierce and hungry dog that scents raw meat before its muzzle . But the mental leap was jerked to a halt in midair as if by a short chain . " I take it the odds are long ? " I said . The integrator quoted a very lopsided ratio . " Indeed , " I said . " But what does it signify ? " " It would be premature ... , " it began . " Nevermind . " I tried to think of possible circumstances that could empty two unrelated accounts of all but the same small sum . After sustained effort , I came up with what seemed to be a pertinent question . " Do Alfazzian and I use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then it ca n't just be a defective integrator ? " " Integrators do not become defective , " was the reply . " I did not mean to offend . " " Integrators do not take offense . We are above such things . " " Indeed . " There was a silence . " How could the closely guarded integrators of two solvencies be induced to eliminate the funds of two separate depositors except for an identical trifle ? " I asked . " Hypothetically , a master criminal of superlative abilities might be able to accomplish it . " " Does such a master criminal exist ? " " No , " was the answer , followed by a qualification . " But if such a criminal did exist he would almost certainly have the power to disguise his existence . " " Even from the Archonate 's Bureau of Scrutiny ? " I wondered . " Unlikely , but possible . The scroots are not completely infallible . " " But if there was such a master purloiner , what would be his motivation in impoverishing me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of our assailant ? " " No motive seems apparent , " said the integrator . I pushed my brain for more possibilities . It was like trying to goad a large , lethargic animal that prefers to sleep . " Who else might be able to subvert the fiduciary pools ? " I said . " Could it be an inside job ? " " It is hard to imagine a cabal of officers from two financial institutions conspiring to defraud two prominent customers . " " And , again , where lies a motive ? " My mind was no more help than my assistant in answering that question . But if the machinery would not turn over , I still retained a grasp of the fundamentals of investigations : the transgressor would be he who had the means , motive , and opportunity to commit the offense . I considered all three factors in the light of the known facts and was stymied . " I am stymied , " I said . Then a faint inspiration struck . I asked the integrator , " If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind , what would I now propose to do ? " The integrator replied , " You have occasionally said that although with most problems the simplest answer is usually correct , sometimes one encounters situations where the bare facts stubbornly resist explanation . In such a case , adding further complications paradoxically clarifies the issue . " I could remember having said those exact words . Now I asked the integrator , " Have you any idea what I meant when I said that ? " " Not really . " I scratched my head again . " Do you have a scalp condition ? " asked my assistant . " Shall I order anything from the chymist ? " " No , " I said . " I was trying to think again . " " Does the scratching help ? " " No . Nor do your interruptions . be useful and posit some complicating factors that might have something to do with the case . " " Very well . You are ugly and not very bright . " " I do n't see how gratuitous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time as you have become poor , your appearance and mental acuity have also been reduced . " " Ahah , " I said . Again there came a glimmer of an idea . This time I managed to fan it into a small flame . " And Alfazzian , who normally delights in displaying his face to the world , hid behind a montage while he spoke with me . " " So the coincidence might be even more extreme , " said the integrator , " if he too has been reduced to ugliness . " " Connect me to him . " A moment later I was again looking at Alfazzian 's screen . " Tell me , " I said , " has there been an alteration in your appearance ? " There was a pause before he said , " How did you know ? " I had never had difficulty answering that question . " I do not reveal my methods , " I said . " Are you taking the case ? " " I am , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay me later . " " I am grateful . " " One question : does it seem to you that your intellectual faculties have been reduced ? " " No , " Alfazzian said , " but then I have always got by on my talent . " " Indeed , " I said . My longstanding impression of the entertainer remained intact : his talent consisted entirely of his fortuitous facial geometry . " Remain at home and wait to hear from me . " I broke the connection and the screen disappeared . I said to my assistant , " Now we know more , but still we know nothing . " We knew that I , who had been brilliant , attractive - or so I would argue - and financially comfortable , had been made dense , repugnant , and indigent . Alfazzian had been admittedly more handsome than I and probably much more wealthy , and now he was also without funds or looks - but his intellect had not been correspondingly ravished . " There is a pattern here , " I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrestled with the facts but could not get a secure grip . The effort was made more difficult by a growing clamor from the street outside my quarters . I went to the window and , bidding the integrator minimize the obscuring membrane , looked down at a growing disturbance . Several persons were clustered before a doorway on the opposite side of Shiplien Way , beating at the closed portal with fists , feet and , in the case of a large and choleric woman in yellow taffeta , a parasol . As I watched , more participants joined the mob , then all took to shouting threats and imprecations at a smooth-headed man who leaned from an upper window and implored them to return another day . The door , which remained closed , led to a branch of the Olkney Mercantile , one of the city 's most patronized financial institutions . I spoke to my assistant . " Is Alfazzian 's account with the OM ? " " No . " " Then I believe we can add one more new fact to our store . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never been one to judge others on mere appearance , but the assemblage of mismatched features across the street was the least fortunate collection of countenances I had ever seen assembled in one place . " Make that two new facts , " I said . " Hmmm , " I said . Again , it was as if my mind expected a pattern to present itself , but nothing came . It was an unpleasant sensation , the mental equivalent of ascending a staircase and , expecting to find one more riser than the joiner has provided , stepping up onto empty air and crashing down again . " The most handsome man in Olkney is made repellent , " I said to my assistant , " and the most intelligent is made at best ordinary . As well , both are impoverished . So apparently are many others . " I struggled to form a shape from the data and an inkling came . " If Alfazzian and I are the targets and the others are merely bystanders , then why is the institution across the street in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It could be that the attack is general , " said the integrator , " and therefore you and our client are only part of a wider category of victims . " I turned the concept over and looked at it from that angle . It appeared no more comprehensible . " We need more data , " I said . " Access the public advisory service . " The screen reappeared , displaying a fiercely coiffed young woman who was informing Olkney that it was inadvisable to visit the financial district . " Dislocations are occurring , " she said , widening her elegant eyes while uplifting perfectly formed eyebrows . " Two more facts , " said the integrator . " Other depositories must have been raided and there is one attractive person who has not been rendered grim . " " Three facts , " I said . " The painfully handsome man who usually engages her in inane banter about trivialities has not appeared . " But what did it mean ? Were only men affected ? I had the integrator examine other live channels . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities and counties , handsome men still winked and nodded at me from behind fanciful desks . There were no monetary emergencies . But the emissions originating within the city fit the emerging pattern . Of attractive women , there was no shortage ; of good looking men , a dearth . " Regard this one , " said the integrator . We were seeing the farm correspondent of a local news service , a man hired more for his willingness to climb over fences and prod the confined stock at close range than for set of jaw or twinkle of eye . " He has always been hard on the gaze , " I said . " Yes , " agreed my assistant , " but he is grown no harder . " " Another fact , " I said . Matters were almost beginning to assume a shape . If I could have thrust aside the clouds that obscured my mind , I knew I would be able to see it . But the mist remained impenetrably thick . " A question occurs , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oblos Pinnifrant . " " And is his face well or unfortunately constituted ? " " He is so wealthy that his appearance matters not . " " Exactly , " I said . " He delights in inflicting his grotesque features on those who crave his favor , forcing them to vie one against another to soothe him with flattery . Connect me to him . " Pinnifrant 's integrator declined the offer of communication . I said , " Inform him that Olkney 's most insightful discriminator is investigating the disappearance of his fortune . " A moment later , the plutocrat 's lopsided visage appeared on my screen . " What do you know ? " he said . " It would be premature to say . " " Yet you are confident of solving the mystery ? " " You know my reputation . " " True , you have yet to fail . What are your terms ? " My terms were standard : ten percent of whatever I recovered . Pinnifrant 's porcine eyes glinted darkly . " Ten percent of my fortune is itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but thirty-two hepts and fourteen grimlets are not much of a foundation on which to begin anew , even for one with your egregious talent for turning up a profit . " In fact , Pinnifrant had been born to wealth and had only had to watch it breed , but a lifetime of deference from all who rubbed up against him had convinced the magnate that he was the sole font of his tycoonery . After a brief chaffer , he said , " I agree to your terms . Report to me frequently . " he moved to sever the connection . " Wait , " I said . " Have you noticed any diminution of your mental capacities ? " " I am as sharp as ever , " was the answer , " but my three assistants have become effectively useless . " " Has there been any change in the arrangement of their features ? " " I would not know . I do not bother to inspect their faces . " " One last thing , " I said . " Have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Pinnifrant Mutual Solvency 's chief tallyman , appeared on my screen less than a minute after I broke the connection to Pinnifrant. he seemed eager to assist me . " How much remains in his account ? " I asked . " Oblos Pinnifrant has consolidated many of his holdings through us , " Worsthall said . " All but one of his accounts have been reduced to a zero balance . The exception contains thirty-two hepts and fourteen grimlets . " " What about other depositors " holdings ? Are they also reduced to that amount ? " " They are . That is , the male depositors and those who had joint accounts with female partners . " " But women are unaffected ? " " Yes , and children of both sexes . " " And where have the funds gone ? Were they transferred to someone else ? " " They were not . The money is simply not there . " " Is that possible ? " I heard him sigh . " Until today I would have said it was not , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . " " Has there been any change in your physical appearance ? " I asked . " Specifically , your face ? " " What kind of question is that ? " " A pertinent one , I believe . " There was a silence on the line while Worsthall sought his own reflection . When he came back his voice had a quaver . " Something has occurred to my nose and chin , " he said . " As well , there are blemishes . " " Hmm , " I said . " What does it mean ? " I told him it would be premature to say . " You said that all accounts held by men had been reduced to thirty-two hepts and fourteen grimlets . What about accounts that contained less than that amount - were they raised to this mystical number ? " " No , they were unaffected . Is that germane ? " I asked him if he had difficulty understanding the meaning of " premature . " Then another idea broke through the fog . " I wish you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Contact all the other financial institutions in Olkney . Ask if the same thing has happened . " I broke the connection and attempted to rouse my sluggish analytical apparatus , but it continued to lie inert . Again , I asked my assistant , " If I were possessed of my usual faculties , how would I address this conundrum ? " " You would look for a pattern in the data , " it said . " I have done that . I can not see more than the bare outline of what , and not even a glint of why or how . Men have been robbed of their wealth , looks and intelligence , yet who has gained ? Where lies the motive , let alone the means ? " I sighed . " What more would I do if I were intact ? " " You might look for a pattern outside the data , " the integrator said . " You once remarked that it is possible to deduce the shape of an invisible object by examining the holes left by its passage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this situation . " " Nor do 1.1 am accustomed to rely upon you for insights . My task is to assemble and correlate data as you instruct . " " What other brilliancies have I come up with over the years ? Perhaps one will ring a chime and reignite my fires . " " You once opined that the rind is mightier than the melon . You presented this as a particularly profound perception . " " What did it mean ? " " I do not know . When you said it , you were under the influence of certain substances . " " No use , " I said . " Goon . " " You have occasionally noted that the wise man can learn from the fool . " " I remember saying it , " I said , " but now I have no idea what I meant . " " Perhaps something to do with opposites attracting ? " the integrator offered . " I doubt it , " I said . " Do they attract ? If so , it ca n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if not cancel each other out ? It sounds like mutual annihilation , and I 'm sure I 've never been in favor of that . " " You also say that sometimes the most crucial clue is not what has happened , but what has not . " " That sounds more like it , " I said . " Except that the number of things that have n't happened must be astronomically greater than those that have . So how do we pick out the nonexistent events that have meaning ? " " You usually perform some pithy analysis . " " Yes , but I 'm short on pith today . " " Then it will have to be an inspired guess . " " I am far from inspired , " I said . " But I think we have at least defined the crime . The attacks are aimed at intelligent and presentable men as well as those who have more than thirty-two hepts and fourteen grimlets . " Dull men have not been made duller , nor poor men poorer , nor have the unprepossessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all counts . " We come back as always to means , motive , and opportunity . " It was difficult to posit a rational means or an opportunity by which the assumed perpetrator could do so much harm to so many and all apparently at the same moment . I knew from long experience , however , that motives were relatively few and all too common to most of humankind . " Jealousy , " I said . " We may be looking for a poor , not too bright man with a face to curdle milk . " " But if he is dimwitted , how does he contrive to perform the impossible ? " said my assistant . " Indeed , " I said . " ' How " is the operative question . " The integrator made a sound that was its equivalent of a throat clearing . " I have a suggestion , " it said . " What ? " Its tone was tentative . " Magic . " I snorted . It was an automatic response whenever the subject was raised . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Perhaps this is the work of a fool . " That almost made sense , but though I could no longer argue for them , I recalled all my old opinions . " There is no such thing as magic . " " Yet there are arguments for the opposing view . " I had encountered them . Supposedly there was an alternation between magic and physics , between sympathy and rationalism , as operating principles of the phenomenal universe . As the Great Wheel rolled through the eons , one assumed supremacy over the other , only to see the relationship eventually reversed . When one regime took the ascendancy , the other allegedly remained as an embedded seed in its unfriendly host . Thus in an age when magic held sway , its mechanics were still logically extrapolated - there were rules and procedures - while during the present reign of rationality , events at the subquantum level were supposedly determined more by quirks and quiddities than by unalterable laws . I was occasionally braced , at a salon or social , by some advocate of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheel was now nearing the next cusp and that I might live long enough to see the contiguous series of electrons that carried information from one device to another replaced by chains of ensorceled imps , my integrator supplanted by an enchanted familiar . I had investigated the arcana of magic over a summer during my youth and could demolish its advocates with arguments that were both subtle and vigorous . However , I had to admit that those arguments were at present beyond my grasp . Still , I harrumphed once more and said , " Magic ! " then blew air over my lips as if shooing away a gossamer . My assistant said , " You also like to say that when all impossibilities have been swept from the table what remains , however unlikely , must be the answer . " " Magic , " I said , " is one of those impossibilities . " " Are you sure ? " " I used to be , " I said , " so I ought to be now . " " Even a wise man can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell me that Pinnifrant 's tallyman was back . " What have you learned ? " " The same situation pertains across the city . Indeed , even accounts held outside Olkney by male residents of the city have been affected . " The more I learned the more perplexed I became . Even in my diminished state , I recognized the irony . I had long wished for a superlative opponent , a master criminal who could give me room to stretch . Now one had seemingly appeared , but in doing so had robbed me of the capacity to combat his outrages . Still , I struggled to encompass an image of the situation . " And there is no indication that anyone has benefited from the thefts ? " I asked Worsthall . " No woman 's account has ballooned ? No child 's ? " " No . " " Thank you , " I said , though I could not see how the information helped . " There is one anomaly , " he said . " Hmm ? " " A male depositor at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grimlets before the discrepancy this morning .... " " Discrepancy ? " I asked . " It is a term we in the financial sector use when accounts do not tally . " " Why not be bold and call it what it is , mass theft and rampant rapine ? " " If we were bold , we would not be bankers , " was the reply . " Indeed , " I said , " but what were you about to tell me ? " " That a male depositor had a balance of thirty-two hepts and fifteen grimlets before the ... rampant rapine , and that he had the same balance afterward . And still does . " I had him repeat the numbers again . " This depositor had one grimlet more than the ubiquitous H32.14 before the ... the event , and he still has the same amount now ? " " As of three minutes ago , " said the tallyman . " Hmm , " I said . I experienced a vague sense that the anomaly might be significant . " Who is he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell me about him . " There was little to tell : only an address on a cul-de-sac off the Fader Slide , an obscure location in an uncelebrated part of the city . No image of Errible reposed in the solvency 's files , and the connectivity code he had given when opening the account was long since defunct . The account had not been used for many years and had probably been forgotten by its nominee . I left the tallyman to his troubles and set my assistant to scouring all sources for news of this Vashtun Errible . The integrator turned up only one more item : a deed of indenture that bound Errible 's services to the requirements of one Bristal Baxandall . " Now that 's a name I have heard before , " I said , though I could not immediately place it . " He prefers to be known as The Exalted Sapience Bristal Baxandall , an alleged thaumaturge , " said the integrator . " He performs at children 's parties . " Again I spied the glimmer of an idea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hiding his brilliance by masquerading as a low-rent prestidigitator . Or he might be only the blind behind which Errible , the true prodigy , had concealed himself . I had a hunch that one or both of these two persons was central to the mystery . Normally , I despised hunches and had always denied their validity - to my mind , an intuition was no more than the product of an analytical process that took place in the mind 's dark back rooms . Occasionally , a door was flung open and the result of unconscious analysis was tossed into the light of the mental front parlor , to be discovered by the incumbent as if it had arrived by mystical means . The thought led to another : I wondered if my own back rooms were as fully stocked and active as always but that some force had sealed the doors . The more I examined the idea , mentally probing about in my inner recesses the way my tongue would explore the gap left by an extracted tooth , the more it seemed likely that my faculties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of reach . I listened and it seemed that I could almost hear the ghost of my former genius crying out to me from beyond a barrier in my mind . I realized that my assistant was saying something . " Repeat , " I said . " The Exalted Sapience 's address is the same as that which the solvency found for Vashtun Errible , " it said . " Connect me . " " I can not . He apparently possesses no integrator . " " How is that possible ? " " I can not even speculate , " said the integrator . " His house appears as a blank spot in the connectivity matrix . " " Ahah ! " I said again . " The shape left by the invisible object ! " " What do you mean ? " I did not know . It was another hunch . " It would be premature to say , " I said . " Summon an air-car and have it take me to that address . " The vehicle was longer than usual in arriving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we rose above the rooftops I saw why : thick columns of greasy , black smoke boiled skyward from several sites along the big bend in the river , joining to form a pall over the south side of the city . To the west , several streets were blocked off by emergency vehicles bearing the lights and colors of the provost bureau , and a surging mob was rampaging through the financial district , smashing glass and overturning motilators . The air-car banked and flew north toward an industrial precinct that looked to be quieter . After a few minutes it angled down to a dead-end street below the slideway and alighted before an ill-kept two-story house whose windows were obscured by dark paint . I bid the car remain but it replied that it could only do so if I paid the accumulated fare immediately and allowed it to deduct its waiting fee every five minutes . " How much ? " I asked and was told that I owed seven hepts . Furthermore , it would charge me twenty grimlets per minute to wait . " Usually , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " These are unusual times , " it said , and I was forced to agree to the terms . The house was dilapidated , the paint peeling , and some siding sprung loose . Dank weeds had invaded and occupied the front lawn , and the porch sagged when I topped the front steps . There was a faint smell of boiled vegetables . There were symbols painted on the front door . They seemed vaguely familiar but my uncertain memory could not produce their meanings . There was no who's-there beside the door , the house having no integrator to operate it . I struck the painted wood with my knuckles to make my presence known . There was no response nor any sound from within . A second knocking brought no result , so I tried the latch and the door opened inward . I stepped within and called for attention . There was no answer . I looked about and saw a small , untidy foyer from which a closed door led left , a stairway went upward , and a short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchen . I called again and heard what might have been a reply from behind the closed door . I opened it and looked into a cramped and fusty parlor dominated by an oversized table draped in black cloth on which was scattered an arrangement of objects and instruments I could not immediately identify . The opaqued windows let in no light , and the only illumination was from some of the strewn bric-a-brac that emitted dim glows and wavering auras . " Hello ? " I said and again heard a moan from the gloom beyond the table . I produced a small lumen from my pouch and activated it so that I could work my way around the table without stepping on more knickknacks that seemed to have fallen to the floor . Under the table on the far side was what I first took to be a bundle of stained cloth loosely stuffed with raw meat and bare bones . A warm and unappetizing smell rose from it . The cloth was dark and figured with designs and symbols similar to those on the front door , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now it was clear that the bundle was its source . " What is this ? " I said , more to myself than to any expected audience , but I was answered by a rich , deep voice from behind me . " Not what , but who , " it said , " and the answer is The Exalted Sapience Bristal Baxandall . That answer will be valid for at most only a few minutes longer . After that , there are different schools of thought . Would you care to discuss the nature of being and the relationship of soul to identity ? " I had turned around and found that the voice issued from what I had initially assumed to be a framed abstract on the wall . But I saw now that this painting constantly moved , thick shapes of unusual colors ceaselessly flowing into and out of themselves , their proportions and directions seeming to mislead the eye . A few seconds of regarding it evoked a dizziness and I looked away . " I am not equipped for metaphysical discussions today , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Indeed ? " said the painting . " Would you know anything about that ? " I asked in a noncommittal tone . " It would be premature to say , " said the voice . I directed the conversation to The Exalted Sapience . " What has happened to him ? " " He was undertaking a transformational exercise . " " Surely he did not wish to be transformed into that ? " " No . It was not his intent to rearrange himself quite so drastically . He wanted only to be younger . " " Not richer , smarter , and better looking ? " I asked . There was a chuckle . " No , that ambition was Vashtun Errible 's . " " He would be Baxandall 's servant ? " The voice chuckled . " He is the servant , at least until the indenture expires with Baxandall , in a few minutes at the most . He would be the master , though I doubt he will be . " " And where is Errible now ? " " He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went amiss with his plan . The first part went as he expected : he adulterated one of the ingredients in the master 's transformation exercise and produced the unhappy result under the table ; the second part varied from his expectations . " " What went wrong ? " " I did . " " And what , exactly , are you ? " " Again , there are conflicting schools of thought . Baxandall called me a demon ; you might call me a figment of the imagination . The Exalted Sapience conscripted me to be his familiar and strove to find ways to channel my .. . energies , shall we say , for his own purposes . Vashtun Errible sees me , quite erroneously , as a box from which he may extract his every tawdry dream . " I saw it now . " He desired to be the richest , smartest , handsomest man in Olkney , " I said . " He was a scraggly shrub that pined to grow into the tallest deodar in the forest . Instead , you shrank the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to confound him . " " But did it further your interests ? " I said . " You indicated that your servitude is involuntary . " The shapes in the frame performed a motion that might have been a shrug . " But temporary . Baxandall managed to catch me in a clumsy trap . You see , I am of an adventuresome disposition . Boredom led me to become an explorer of adjacent dimensions , even dusty corners like your own . I thought I had found a peephole into your realm , but when I pressed my eye against it - you will understand that I speak metaphorically - I encountered a powerful adhesive . " The faint voice in the back of my mind was clamoring . I apparently had questions to ask , but I could not make out what they were . Yet even with only a fragment of my usual intellect I perceived that I was in a perilous situation . The entity in the frame exuded a grim complacency . It was about to exact vengeance for its enslavement , and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on innocent bystanders . " I shall leave , " I said . " Good luck with Errible . " But as I made my way around the table , this time keeping the furniture between me and the thing hanging on the wall , a hunch-shouldered figure in a tattered robe appeared in the doorway . I knew from the disharmony of his features that this was Baxandall 's indentee . He held open before him a large book bound in leather , and as soon as he entered the chamber , he began to recite from its pages in a voice that came as much from his misshapen nose as from his slack-lipped mouth , " Arbrustram merrilif oberluz , destoi malleonis .... " And then he saw me and his concentration slipped . he broke off in mid-sentence - only for a moment , but the moment might as well have been an eon , because during that brief caesura the entity on the wall extruded part of itself into the room . It was something like an arm , something like a tentacle , something like an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen ; but it seized Vashtun Errible about the neck , lifted his worn slippers from the carpet and drew him into the swirl of motion within the frame . The book fell from his hands as his face was drawn into the maelstrom . The rest of his body followed , pulled through the frame with a sound that reminded me of thick liquid passing through a straw . But I was not concentrating on the peculiarities of Errible 's undoing ; for the moment his head entered the frame , my faculties were restored . I took in the room again , but with new eyes . I recognized some of the objects on the table and recalled having read about the fallen book in my youth . Thus , when the thing in the window had done with Errible and reached for me , it found me holding the volume and quoting the passage that the indentee had begun . The limb retracted and the shapes in the frame roiled and coruscated . I could not read the emotions , but I was willing to infer rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome as you may think , " I said , when the cantrip had once more bound the demon . " Our perspectives differ , as is to be expected when one party holds the leash and the other wears the collar , " said the thing in the window . " We did not finish discussing where your interests lie , nor had we even begun to consider mine . But if we can cause them to coincide , I am prepared to relinquish the leash and slip the collar . " The next sound approximated a sardonic laugh . " After I arrange for you to rule your boring little world , no doubt . " I made a sound involving lower teeth , upper lip , and an explosion of air , and said , " Do I strike you as one who aspires to be a civil servant ? The Archon already performs that tedious function , and good luck to him . " A note of interest crept into the demon 's tone . " Then what do you wish ? " I told him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his works became as if they never were . Grier Alfazzian 's prospects had never dimmed and Oblos Pinnifrant 's fortune had not been touched , thus neither owed me a grimlet nor knew that they ever had . I did not care . My fees had become increasingly arbitrary : for an interesting case I would take no more than the client could afford ; if it bored me , I would include a punitive surcharge . In recent years , as experience had augmented my innate abilities , truly absorbing puzzles had become few and infrequent . I had begun to fear that the rest of my life would offer long decades of ennui , my mind constantly spinning but always in want of traction . My encounter with the demon had put that fear to rest . all I had needed was a worthy challenger . The next morning I entered my workroom . An envelope rested on my table . I opened it and found a tarnished key and a small square of paper . On the key was a symbol that tweaked at my memory , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper was the single word , Aidmere . I placed both on the table and regarded them . I could not resist rubbing my hands together . But before I began to enjoy the mystery , I must fulfill my side of the bargain . I took from my pocket a sliver of charred wood in which two hairs were caught . I crossed the room and presented the splinter to the frame hanging on my wall . " Not where , not when , not who - but why ? " I said . A kind of hand took the object from me and drew it into the shifting colors . " Hmmm , " said my opponent , " interesting . " " Last one to solve the puzzle is a dimbo , " I said and turned toward the table . " Ready , set ... go ! " <p>
