1 March 24 , 1977 Jonah was dead for a brief time before the paramedics brought him back to life . He never talks about it , but its on his mind sometimes , and he finds himself thinking that maybe its the central fact of the rest of his life , maybe its what set his future into motion . He thinks of the fat cuckoo clock in his grandfathers living room , the hollow thump of weights and the dissonant guitar thrum of springs as the little door opened and the bird popped out ; he thinks of his own heart , which was stopped when they got to him and then suddenly lurched forward , no one knew why , it just started again right around the time they were preparing to pronounce him deceased . This was in late March 1977 , in South Dakota , a few days after his sixth birthday . If his memory were a movie , the camera would begin high in the air . In a movie , he thinks , you would see his grandfathers little house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming to a stop at the edge of the long gravel road . Jonah had been to school that day . He had learned something , perhaps several things , and he rode home in a school bus . There were papers in his canvas knapsack , handwriting and addition and subtraction tables that the teacher had graded neatly with red ink , and a picture of an Easter egg that hed colored for his mother . He sat on a green vinyl seat near the front of the bus and did nt even notice that the bus had stopped because he was deeply interested in a hole that someone had cut in the seat with a pocketknife ; he was peering into it , into the guts of the seat , which were made of metal springs and stiff white hay . Outside it was fairly sunny , and the snow had mostly melted . The exhaust from the buss muffler drifted through the flashing warning lights , and the silent bus driver lady caused the doors to fold open for him . He did nt like the other children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nt like him either . He could sense their faces , staring , as he went down the bus steps and stood on the soft , muddy berm . But in the movie you wouldnt see that . In the movie you would only see him emerging from the bus , a boy running with his backpack dragging through the wet gravel , a red stocking cap , a worn blue ski jacket , stones grinding together beneath his boots , a pleasantly rhythmic noise he was making . And you would be up above everything like a bird , the long gravel road that led from the mailbox to the house , the weeds along the ditches , the telephone poles , barbed-wire fences , railroad tracks . The horizon , the wide plain of dust and wind . Jonahs grandfathers house was a few miles outside of the small town of Little Bow , where Jonah went to school . It was a narrow , mustard-colored farmhouse with a cottonwood beside it and a spindly chokecherry bush in front . These were the only trees in view , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to time a train would pass by on the railroad tracks that ran parallel to the house . Then the windows would hum like the tuning fork their teacher had shown them in school . This is how sound feels , their teacher said , and let them hold their fingers near the vibrating tines . Sometimes it seemed to Jonah that everything was very small . In the center of his grandfathers bare backyard , an empty pint of cream would be the house and a line of matchbook cars , Scotch-taped end to end , would be the train . He did nt know why he liked the game so much , but he remembered playing it over and over , imagining himself and his mother and his grandfather and his grandfathers dog , Elizabeth , all of them inside the little pint container , and himself ( another part of himself ) leaning over them like a giant or a thundercloud , pushing his makeshift train slowly past . He did nt call to his grandfather when he came into the house that day . The door banged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the television talking in his grandfathers room , so he knew his grandfather was there , dozing in the little windowless room , an addition to the house , just space enough for his grandfathers bed and a dresser , a small TV and a lamp with curlicues of cigarette smoke around them . His grandfather was propped up against some pillows , drinking beer ; an old blanket , pilled cotton , silk edges unraveling , was thrown across his grandfathers middle , an ashtray balanced on it . Tired . His grandfather worked as a janitor , he went to work early in the morning , while it was still dark . Sometimes when Jonah came home from school , his grandfather would come out of his room and tell Jonah stories or jokes , or he would complain about things , about being tired , about Jonahs motherWhats the problem with her now ? Did you do something to get her mad ? I did nt do anything to her ! and he would swear about people that he did nt like , people who had cheated him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , Babygirl , babygirl , what are you doing there , does a babygirl want a piece of lunch meat does she ? and Elizabeth would come clicking her nails across the floor , her bobbed tail almost vibrating as she wagged it , her eyes full of love as Jonahs grandfather crooned to her . But Jonahs grandfather did nt come out of his room that day , and Jonah dropped his bookbag to the floor of the kitchen . There was the smell of smoke , and fried eggs , and the old food in the refrigerator . Unwashed dishes in the sink . His grandfathers door was half-closed , and Jonah sat at the kitchen table for a time , eating cereal . His mother was at work . He did nt know whether he missed her or not , but he thought of her as he sat there in the still kitchen . She worked at a place called Harmony Farm , packing eggs , she said , and the tone of her voice made him imagine dark labyrinths with rows of nests , a promenade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wouldnt talk about it when she got home . Often , she wouldnt want to talk at all , wouldnt want to be touched , would make their supper , which she herself wouldnt eat . She would go to her room and listen to old records shed had since she was in junior high , her eyes open and her hands in a praying shape beneath her cheek , her long hair spread out behind her on the pillow . He could stand there for a very long time , watching her from the edge of the doorway and she wouldnt move . The needle of the phonograph pulsed like a smooth car along the spiraling track of a record album and her eyes seemed to register the music more than anything else , her blinking coinciding with a pause or a beat . But he knew that she could see him standing there . They were looking at each other , and it was a sort of gameto try to blink when she blinked , to set his mouth in the same shape as her mouth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of game to see how far he could inch into the room , sliding his feet the way a leaf opens , and sometimes he was almost to the center of the room before she finally spoke . Get out , she would say , almost dreamily . And then she would turn her face away from him , toward the wall . He thought of her as his spoon hovered over his cereal . One day , he thought , she wouldnt come home from work . Or she might disappear in the night . He had awakened a few times : footsteps on the stairs , in the kitchen , the back door opening . From the upstairs window he saw her forcing her arm into the sleeve of her coat as she walked down the driveway . Her face was strange in the pale brightness cast by the floodlights that his grandfather had installed outside the house . Her breath lifted up out of her in the cold and drifted like mist , trailing behind her as she moved into the darkness beyond the circle of porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell Jonah sometimes . She would talk about the places where they used to live as if theyd just come to Jonahs grandfathers house for a visit , even though theyd been living there for as long as he could rememberalmost three years . He did nt remember much about the other places she talked about . Chicago . Denver . Fresno . Had he been to these cities ? He wasnt sure . Sometimes things came in flashes and images , not really memories at alla staircase leading down , with muddy boots outside of it ; a man with a fringed jacket like Davy Crockett , asleep on a couch while Jonah looked inside his open mouth ; a lamp with autumn leaves patterned on it ; a cement shower stall where he and his mother had washed together . Sometimes he thought he remembered the other baby , the one that had been born before him . I was very young , she told him . That was all she would tell . I was very young . I had to give it away . I remember the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together talking , when she was feeling friendly , holding him in her arms , running her fingernails lightly back and forth across his cheek . I remember the baby , he said , and her face grew stiff . She took her hand away . No , you do nt , she said . Do nt be stupid . You werent even born yet . She sat there for a moment , regarding him , and then she shut her eyes , her teeth tightening against one another as if the sight of him hurt her . Jesus Christ , she said . Why do nt you just forget I ever told you anything . I mean , I confide in you with something thats very private , and very important , and you want to play little pretend games ? Are you a baby ? She sat there coldly , frowning , and began to gather and arrange her hair , ignoring him . She had long hair that reached almost to the belt-loops of her jeans . His grandfather said she looked like the country singer Crystal Gayle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? his grandfather would say when he was trying to cheer her up , but she would only smile a little , not really happy . He watched as she shook a cigarette from her pack on the coffee table and lit it . Do nt look at me that way , she said . She took a sip of smoke from her cigarette , and he tried to make his expression settled and neutral , to make his face the way she might want it to be . Mom ? he said . What ? Where do babies go when you give them away ? He wanted to make his voice sound innocent , to talk in the way a child on television might ask about Santa Claus . He wanted to pretend to be a certain type of child , to see if she might believe in it . But she did nt . Where do babies go when you give them away ? she repeated , in a high , insipid voice , and she did nt look at him , she did nt think he was cute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , her hand as she ran the head of her cigarette against the rim of the ashtray . They go to live with nice mommies , she said . After a moment shed shrugged darkly , not liking him anymore , not wanting to talk . But he did remember the baby , he thought . He and his mother had seen it at the market , being watched by a lady he did nt know . The baby was pink-skinned , and had a tiny head without hair on it and it was inside somethinga basket , he thought , a basket like apples came in at the grocery store . The baby was dressed in a green velvet suit with a Santas head on it , and rested on a red cushion . It moved its hands blindly , as if trying to catch air . Look , his mother said . Theres my baby ! And a lady had looked at them , stiffening as his mother bent down to wave her fingers over the babys line of vision . The lady had looked at them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonah sharply . Please do nt touch , the lady said . Your hands are dirty . He remembered this vividlynot only because of the baby but because of the ladys eyes , the way she looked at him , the sharp sound of her voice . It was the first time he really understood that there was something about him that people did nt like .
