<p> On a Friday night in a spacious , dimly lit cafe , Perica Bobic hurried over to a table , dumped his gray-and-red duffle bag to the ground and grabbed a seat in a crowded leather booth . Bobic 's soft blue eyes darted toward the others around the table , then he quickly snatched the 50 Cent cap from his head and rubbed his closely cropped blond hair back into place . He did n't want to be disrespectful , especially since he was here on business . <p> Bobic is 14 . This evening , his coach , his mother , her boyfriend and a prominent agent were gathered to discuss his future . <p> In a year-long series of stories , The Washington Post has documented numerous problems in the U.S. approach to developing young basketball players . Foreign countries use vastly different training systems and have successfully challenged the United States ' former dominance in international play . But in foreign countries , the systems also introduce young players to both opportunities and pitfalls . <p> During a weekend visit with one youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dedicated coach , Marko Radovanovic , who seeks the professional and personal development of his players ; in a tall playful forward , Alexander Gardovic , who must use his basketball talents to help his family make ends meet ; in a pint-sized and spunky point guard , Luka Fustic , whose desire to be a better basketball player prompts him to take 30-minute bus rides back and forth each day from his suburban home to practice ; and in Bobic , a fun-loving but temperamental player whose talents could take him to the NBA  --  or make him vulnerable to exploitation . <p> It 's not unusual for the most talented players in Serbia to be approached by agents at age 16  --  and even younger  --  in hopes of selling them to the highest bidder at age 18 , when players are free to sign with the club of their choice in Europe . Jovan Djordjevic-Marinkovic , a 13-year-old player in Red Star 's youth program , already has an agent . <p> Bobic also is highly sought after , as a member of a 14-and-under cadet team @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clubs in Serbia , which has produced more NBA players than any country outside of the United States . New Orleans Hornets swingman Peja Stojakovic , the biggest Serbian star currently in the NBA , developed in Red Star 's youth programs and serves as an inspiration for many of the participants . <p> Bobic 's coach , Radovanovic , is a 29-year-old Belgrade native who spent two years in the United States  --  his senior year in high school and freshman year in college  --  and speaks five languages . His job involves more than just X 's and O 's . He often has to serve as mentor and friend to his players . Out of concern for his star player Bobic , Radovanovic arranged the Friday night meeting with European basketball agent Alexander Raskovic , who helped Stojakovic , Vladimir Radmanovic and Nenad Krstic get to the NBA . <p> The coach 's aims are to keep the talented 6-foot-5 Bobic away from agents with questionable intentions and to provide another positive influence to keep him on the correct path . <p> Bobic , nicknamed " Peca " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law but he has a reputation for a short fuse and fighting and could easily be lost to the streets , Radovanovic said . Bobic is rebellious at times and tunes out his mother , Jelena , an attractive infomercial pitchperson who has raised him alone since his father died . " He could be the next Dirk Nowitzki , " Raskovic said of Bobic , " or he could be a gangster . It 's half-and-half . " <p> During the meeting , Jelena Bobic seemed anxious , barely touching the bottled water on the table . She pulled out a cigarette from her purse and took a long drag as Raskovic informed her that he has no interest in signing her son  --  at least , until he turns 18 . Instead , he was here to provide a warning , to protect her and Peca from the " slimy " agents , Raskovic said , who have taken advantage of the dire economic situation  --  and overly ambitious parents  --  in this war-torn nation in recent years and began signing kids to " bogus " deals . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fancy chain , a little money , let them party with pretty girls , " he said to a visitor before shaking his head . " It 's sick , I tell you . " <p> Raskovic then gave Jelena Bobic a list of seven names to avoid and tells her he is willing to advise them in any way . She receives no money , but accepts the agreement . The 45-minute discussion was mostly in Serbian , but afterward Raskovic explained that she had hoped to sign a contract with him . " The parents have a dream , an American dream , to be rich overnight , " he said . " They have dream to wake up tomorrow with contract of Peja Stojakovic , " who signed a five-year , $64 million contract with New Orleans last summer . <p> Coach Radovanovic , who had been listening from the opposite end of the table , interrupted to ask for the time . It 's 9 p.m . He and Peca have to leave for practice . <p> Unlike in some other countries , such as CSKA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford its own top-flight gymnasium with weight rooms for its young players  --  who range in age from 10 to 18 . It has to rent gyms throughout Belgrade , forcing Bobic and his teammates to sacrifice their social lives to endure intense , physically draining practices late at night , well after their high school classes . Their motivations for playing basketball are similar to many youths in America  --  fun , popularity and escapism . But the circumstances are very different . Friday nights at the movies ? Try practice until close to midnight . Saturday afternoons at the mall ? More practice . This is their life 50 weeks out of the year . <p> Why does Bobic do it ? " I play basketball for love , " he said . " I do n't play for money and fame . Money will come . " <p> Practicing for two hours in a chilly cavernous gym until 11:30 p.m. is n't an inconvenience for a group of players accustomed to obstacles . They were born and raised during a time of hardship and economic transition in Serbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of Belgrade , which has a vibrant night life but an overall grimy feel , there are constant reminders of 78-day NATO bombing during the Kosovo Conflict in 1999 , as some of the buildings that were destroyed have been left untouched . Marin Sedlacek , director of youth development programs for Red Star in Belgrade and camp director of the NBA 's Basketball Without Borders Europe since 2001 , said the adversity has made Serbian players , especially those of the younger generations , stronger than most . <p> " Our kids are very tough , because they grow up in the tough conditions , " Sedlacek said from his office at Red Star . " To stay in sanctions for five years and to be bombed for 78 days , you discover all the different parts of your life . How to take a shower with two bottles of water , how to work without electricity , how you will spend your day under the horns and signals of air strikes . " <p> Radovanovic 's team plays only one or two games each month because the goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to produce professional basketball players , not necessarily winning championships . " What shall we do with all those trophies ? If you saw one player on the wall that 's in the NBA , that 's more for me than we won some cups , " Sedlacek said , with a picture of a 15-year-old Stojakovic hanging on the wall behind him . <p> In addition to their late night practices on weekdays , players can choose to have individual training for two hours , three times a week . Gardovic and Fustic left their respective high schools and rushed to another gym , a shoe-box-sized building in a rundown part of the city , working on their jump shots and free throws until 5 p.m . The old gym looked like a relic . The rims were attached to brick walls with no padding and the hardwood court is full of dead spots . <p> Radovanovic said : " These kids today are going to commit five hours to basketball . To me , that 's professionalism . Nothing else . " <p> Gardovic , 6 feet 7 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three players on the cadet team who are paid ; he receives a salary of about $350 per month . Radovanovic said Gardovic 's salary amounts to one-third of his household 's income , almost the same money earned by his father , a factory worker , and his mother , a cleaning woman . Most of the players receive a stipend for clothes , shoes and equipment , while about five others pay to be a part of Red Star . <p> Asked about handling the responsibility of helping his family financially at such a young age , Gardovic shrugged his broad shoulders . " The real money will come years later , " he said , with Radovanovic providing the translation . Gardovic 's motivations for playing basketball were a bit different from Bobic 's  --  " women , wealth and making new friends . " <p> After the individual workout , Radovanovic gave Gardovic a ride home to an area of New Belgrade he referred to as the " ghetto , " a seemingly endless stream of plain , concrete , high-rise apartment buildings . Radovanovic is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the center of the neighborhood is an outdoor court where dozens of children played basketball as the sun was setting . <p> Radovanovic dropped off Fustic at a bus stop near downtown for his ride to Kotez , an affluent suburb north of Belgrade . Fustic 's father runs a construction company and drives a Bentley and his mother owns a hair salon . But in an effort to not set himself apart from the pack , Fustic avoids flaunting his wealth in any way , sporting the same team-issued And 1 apparel as his teammates and repeatedly refusing his father 's requests to drive him back and forth from practice , relying exclusively on the bus . <p> Fustic went home to eat dinner and then journeyed back to practice with his teammates . During the half-hour ride , Fustic does n't pass the time with an iPod or a Game Boy . " I like to watch people and imagine what their life is like , " he said . Asked to explain his commitment , he replied : " I love this game . " <p> After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life could be like . " See you in the NBA , " he told a visitor .
