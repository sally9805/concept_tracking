<p> Can the United States run a war and an open economy at the same time ? <p> In the wake of the Dubai ports imbroglio , some lawmakers are saying the U.S. needs to rethink its openness . Rep. Duncan Hunter , R-Calif. , chairman of the House Armed Services Committee , for example , is demanding that all of the USA 's " critical infrastructure " be owned and managed by American citizens . <p> While there is no across-the-board move to erect walls around the U.S. economy yet , some analysts worry that the combination of national security and industry-specific economic fears could spiral . <p> Hunter 's legislation would require foreign companies that own anything deemed " critical " to national security , economic security or public health to sell within five years . Sen. Charles Schumer , D-N.Y. , reacting to the surging U.S. trade deficit , has proposed imposing a blanket 27.5% tariff on Chinese imports if Beijing does n't allow its currency to appreciate . <p> " Today , it 's the Middle East . Last summer ... it was China @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roubini , an economist who operates the rgemonitor.com global economy website . <p> A combustible mix of security and economic dangers has left Americans increasingly unsettled about their engagement with the rest of the world . Color-coded terror alerts and the persistence of the global al-Qaeda network mean danger is a fact of daily life . Compounding public unease is the relentless economic rise of China and India , which seems to imperil many Americans ' financial futures . <p> From 1994 until last year , a solid plurality of Americans saw foreign trade as an opportunity rather than a threat , according to USA TODAY polling . In May 2000 , for example , trade was backed 56% to 36% . But in a June 2005 survey , by a 48% to 44% margin , more respondents judged it a threat . <p> " Globalization creates vulnerabilities . There 's no question about it , " says Mira Wilkins , an expert on foreign investment at Florida International University in Miami . <p> The USA is n't alone in getting cold feet over globalization . Europe , too , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poland , governments are blocking foreign firms from acquiring companies even in seemingly benign consumer industries . <p> Global ties grow <p> If the concerns suddenly seem acute , it may be because in recent years the globalization era that began with the collapse of communism in 1989 has intensified dramatically . Example : Cross-border mergers and acquisitions totaled a staggering $3.2 trillion last year , almost three times the level just five years earlier , according to the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland . <p> The U.S. certainly is much more intertwined with other economies than ever . In 1971 , when President Nixon cut the link between the dollar and gold , U.S. imports were equivalent to 5.5% of the economy . Last year , they hit 16.2% . <p> The furor over the DP World ports takeover may have surprised the White House . But it did n't come out of nowhere . Last summer , it took enormous political arm-twisting to get a very modest Central American trade deal through Congress . Then , in the fall , a Chinese enterprise was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil company , after Congress heatedly objected . And now an Arab firm has been told it ca n't be trusted to operate cargo terminals at American ports . <p> " I think we 're riding a wave of xenophobia , " says William Reinsch , president of the National Foreign Trade Council , a pro-trade group . <p> Still , the reaction to date against foreign investment  --  whether for national security or economic reasons  --  has been limited . Both the ports controversy and last year 's Unocal dust-up involved foreign companies that were government-controlled . Moves to limit Chinese imports have been confined to specific industries , notably textiles and apparel . <p> " It 's not competitive concerns like the 1980s . GM and Ford are in rough shape , but there 's not much sympathy for helping them " with import limits , says Todd Malan , president of the Organization for International Investment . <p> The ports furor catalyzed the debate over security and globalization , though the immediate prospect of an Arab company operating terminals at several U.S. ports appears to have faded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spin off its newly acquired American operations so long as it could do so without losing money . <p> More complicated times <p> This is n't the first time the U.S. has faced the issue . An earlier age of global economic integration in the decades before World War I ended with the guns of August 1914 . After the war , trade recovered in fits and starts . But then the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff triggered a protectionist frenzy that by 1934 had slashed international trade by two-thirds . <p> During the Cold War , the relationship between national security and commerce seemed clear . Buttressing the economies of Western Europe helped knit together an anti-Soviet alliance . There was no question about who the enemy was and no question of trading with him . Today , life is n't so simple . Instead of a government like the Soviet Union , the enemy in the war on terror is a stateless network of Islamic extremists . <p> " We 're now in an era where the national security interests of the United States are a lot more ambiguous , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frieden of Harvard University . " Even if there 's agreement on fighting terrorism , it 's not clear what the economic implications of that are . " <p> Those who argue for changing the rules of the game target the inter-agency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States ( CFIUS ) , which approved the ill-fated ports deal . The committee gathers representatives of 12 agencies to balance foreign investments ' gains against potential security threats . <p> Hunter , who helped kill the ports deal , wants to tighten the government 's method of reviewing proposed foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies . Currently , " Economic or commercial implications apparently supersede national security considerations , " the lawmaker wrote in a March 6 letter to colleagues . <p> A Government Accountability Office investigation last year also concluded that the panel " narrowly defines what constitutes a threat to national security . " Since 1988 , CFIUS has rejected only one of more than 1,500 proposed foreign acquisitions of U.S. companies : China National Aero-Technology Import &; Export 's 1990 attempt to acquire a Seattle aircraft parts maker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chinese firm producing 80% of the magnets used in the Pentagon 's " smart bombs , " according to Sen. Evan Bayh , D-Ind . <p> If any security worries are found in the panel 's standard 30-day review , an additional 45-day probe can be launched . But the GAO report said that the committee , which is chaired by the Treasury Department , is reluctant to order such investigations for fear of discouraging foreign investment . Of 470 proposed deals from 1997 to 2004 , CFIUS initiated only eight investigations , the report said . <p> Hunter 's proposed legislation would mandate 45-day probes for " transactions that may have national security implications . " Treasury Secretary John Snow on Tuesday backed increased scrutiny for deals involving state-owned foreign companies but warned against " isolationist " moves . <p> Others say the criticisms are overstated . Phillip Swagel , who was chief of staff for the White House Council of Economic Advisers in President Bush 's first term , says the Pentagon representatives on the panel had a myopic focus on security . " They just did n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Swagel , now a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute . " They 'd rather foreigners not be here at all . " <p> Edward Graham of the Institute for International Economics , author of a forthcoming book on national security and foreign investment , says CFIUS has been more effective than the statistics suggest . Although the panel formally rejected only one deal , it effectively blocked 20 others , he says . Many others were modified by compelling the foreign acquirer to accept changes in how it would operate the American asset . <p> " What major security failure has happened in the U.S. ? None that we know of , " Graham says . <p> U.S. dependent on foreign investment <p> As Congress rethinks foreign investment , Clyde Prestowitz , president of the Economic Strategy Institute , thinks the new focus on security ignores the U.S. economy 's dependence upon foreign investment . The USA requires about $3 billion in foreign capital every working day to finance the huge gap between its consumption of foreign goods and its exports . The country just does n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're shooting ourselves in the foot here . People do n't realize this , but our economy is on life support from foreign lenders and investors . " <p> Questions over foreign investment are n't going away . Next month , Chinese President Hu Jintao is scheduled to meet with President Bush at the White House even as the Treasury Department nears a decision on formally stating that China manipulates its currency for trade advantage . <p> Likewise , thanks to high oil prices , the Dubai Ports deal wo n't be the last Arab investment here . Since 1998 , members of the OPEC oil cartel have earned $1.3 trillion in petrodollars , according to the Bank for International Settlements . Much of it is staying home , helping fuel enormous increases in regional stock markets . But tens of billions of petrodollars have surged into U.S. corporate bonds , equities and direct investment . And more are probably coming . <p> " Foreigners have a whole pile of dollars , " says Reinsch .
