Cons Available only in select markets , and expansion likely to be slow . Newcomer to the TV market ; we have no user @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their cable company , compared with ABOUT 40% of satellite customers . Sidebar Want to pay less ? Just ask If you 're tired of seeing your cable or satellite bill climb , try asking for a better deal . It costs companies more to acquire customers than to retain them , so you might be able to get lower rates by threatening to leave . Many companies have customer-retention specialists to deal with just that situation . They 're more empowered than regular customer-service reps to work out a deal that might include additional channels , a lower rate , fee waivers , or some combination of the three . Anecdotal evidence from our staff shows you can bargain for a better bill . When one staffer canceled his satellite service after the initial promotional rate expired ( and paid a stiff penalty to do so ) , he received a call from a customer-retention specialist . She tried to win him back with more programming for the same monthly fee , a permanent promotional rate , and refund of the penalty , but he 'd already signed up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Another member of our staff reduced her digital-cable bill when she called the company and said she would regretfully switch to a $90 satellite deal unless it could offer something comparable . The company cut her bill from $130 a month to $100 . NEGOTIATING 101 If you want to approach your provider for a lower rate , stress that you 've been a good customer and would like to remain one if they will work with you . Ask for something specific , within reason . If a satellite or fiber-optic deal is tempting you , see whether the cable company can match that or come close . Ash if it will offer you the same rates as promo packages for new customers or whether it can waive any fees for a period of time . Do n't issue ultimatums about canceling unless you really mean it and are ready to switch . And if negotiations do n't go as well as you 'd like , do n't feel compelled to decide on the spot . Tell the customer rep you need time to think it over or to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways to trim your cable bill : Consider a bundle . By using TV , phone , and Internet service from one provider , you 'll get a discounted rate and be in a good position to renegotiate when the promotional rate expires . However , bundles limit your ability to change one service if you do n't like it . Strip down . A little-known law prevents cable companies from forcing you into buying a package beyond the most basic . Find out how much the company charges for the lowest , bare-bones digital service , generally about $15 to $20 a month , then add the supplemental HD package or a premium channel . That might be cheaper than an extended package that contains programs you may never watch . Or opt for single on-demand viewings rather than a package . Check the Web . At least every few months , call your service provider or check its Web site for the latest offers . If they 're better than what you 've got , call and ask for the new deal . Also scope out the competition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find . // <p>
