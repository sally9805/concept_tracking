And do n't forget the sun protection . " Every lipstick provides some sort of physical barrier against UV rays , which is probably why cancers of the lip are so much rarer in women than they are in men , " says Mary Lupo , M.D. , clinical associate professor of dermatology at Tulane University in New Orleans . " Still , it 's a good idea to wear a lipstick with an SPF - or wear an SPF-containing lip balm as a topcoat over your regular lipstick . " Remember , licking your lips is taboo : " It 's the worst thing to do when your lips are dry , since it causes evaporation of fluids . Use a hydrating lipstick or lip balm instead , " says Lupo , who recommends nonmedicated balms since they 're more emollient than those which contain potentially drying phenol and menthol .
