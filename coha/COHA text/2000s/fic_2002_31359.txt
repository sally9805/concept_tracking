Trace was on foot when she saw him again , carrying a saddle over one shoulder , a gloved hand grasping the horn . His hat was pushed to the back of his head , and his pale , sun-streaked hair caught the sunlight . His blue-green eyes flashed bright as sun on water , and the cocky grin she knew oh-so-well curved his mouth . Oh , yes . Even from the other side of Primrose Creek , Bridget knew right off who he was  --  trouble . She had half a mind to go straight into the cabin for Granddaddy 's shotgun and send him packing . Might have done it , too , if she had n't known he was just out of range . The scoundrel had probably figured out what she was thinking , for she saw that lethal grin broaden for a moment , before he tried , without success , to look serious again . He knew he was safe , right enough , long as he kept his distance . She folded her arms . " You just turn yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wherever you came from , " she called . No effect . That was Trace for you , handsome as the devil himself and possessed of a hide like a field ox . Now , he just tipped the brim of that sorry-looking hat and set his saddle down on the stream bank , as easily as if it weighed nothing at all . Bridget , a young widow who 'd spent three months on the trail from St. Louis , with no man along to attend to the heavier chores , knew better . " Now , Bridge , " he said , " that 's no way to greet an old friend . " Somewhere inside this blatantly masculine man was the boy she had known and loved . The boy who had taught her to swim , climb trees , and ride like an Indian . The boy she 'd laughed with and loved with an innocent ferocity that sometimes haunted her still , in the dark of night , after more than a decade . Bridget stood her ground , though a fickle part of her wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his neck in welcome , and hardened her resolve . This was not the Trace she remembered so fondly . This was the man who 'd gotten her husband killed , sure as if he 'd shot Mitch himself . " You just get ! Right now . " He had the effrontery to laugh as he bent to hoist the saddle up off the ground . Bridget wondered what had happened to his horse even as she told herself it did n't matter to her . He could walk all the way back to Virginia as far as she cared , long as he left . " I 'm staying , " he said , and started through the knee-deep , sun-splashed water toward her without even taking off his boots . " Naturally , I 'd rather I was welcome , but your taking an uncharitable outlook on the matter wo n't change anything . " Bridget 's heart thumped against the wall of her chest ; she told herself it was pure fury driving her and paced the creek 's edge to prove it so . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accused . He laughed again . " Yes , ma'am . " Up close , she saw that he 'd aged since she 'd seen him last , dressed in Yankee blue and riding off to war , with Mitch following right along . There were squint lines at the corners of his blue-green eyes , and his face was leaner , harder than before , but the impact of his personality was just as jarring . Bridget felt weakened by his presence , in a not unpleasant way , and that infuriated her . Mitch , she thought , and swayed a little . Her bridegroom , her beloved , the father of her three-year-old son , Noah . Her lifelong friend  --  and Trace 's . Mitch had traipsed off to war on Trace 's heels , like a child dancing after a piper , certain of right and glory . And he 'd died for that sweet , boyish navet of his . " I 've got nothing to say to you , " Bridget said to him . He took off his hat and swiped it once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been born of either annoyance or simple frustration , the distinction being too fine to determine . " Well , " he replied , in a quiet voice that meant he was digging in to outstubborn her , should things come to that pass , " I 've got plenty to say to you , Bridget McQuarry , and you 're going to hear me out . " His gaze strayed over her shoulder to take in the cabin , such as it was . The roof of the small stone structure had fallen in long before Bridget and Skye , her younger sister , and little Noah had finally arrived at Primrose Creek just two months before , after wintering at Fort Grant , a cavalry installation at the base of the Sierras . Right away , Bridget had taken the tarp off the Conestoga and draped it over the center beam , but it made a wretched substitute . Rain caused it to droop precariously and often dripped through the worn cloth to plop on the bed and table and sizzle on the stove . Trace let out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any too soon , " he said . Just then , Skye came bounding around the side of the cabin , an old basket in one hand , face alight with pleasure . She was sixteen , Skye was , and all the family Bridget had left , except for her son and a pair of snooty cousins who 'd passed the war years in England . No doubt , Christy and Megan had been sipping tea , having themselves fitted for silken gowns , and playing lawn tennis , while Bridget and their granddaddy tried in vain to hold on to the farm in the face of challenges from Yankees and Rebels alike . Good riddance , she thought . The last time she 'd seen Christy , the two of them had fought in the dirt like a pair of cats ; they 'd been like oil and water the whole of their lives , Christy and Bridget , always tangling over something . " Trace ! " Skye whooped , her dark eyes shining . He laughed , scooped her into his arms , and spun her around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a sort of fond gruffness in his voice , before planting a brotherly kiss on her forehead . Bridget stood to one side , watching and feeling a little betrayed . She and Skye were as close as two sisters ever were , but if you looked for a resemblance , you 'd never guess they were related . Just shy of twenty-one , Bridget was small , with fair hair and skin , and her eyes were an intense shade of violet , " Irish blue , " Mitch had called them . She gave an appearance of china-doll fragility , most likely because of her diminutive size , but this was deceptive ; she was as agile and wiry as a panther cub , and just about as delicate . Skye , for her part , was tall , a late bloomer with long , gangly legs and arms . Her hair was a rich chestnut color , her wide-set eyes a deep and lively brown , her mouth full and womanly . She was awkward and somewhat dreamy , and though she was always eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things herself . It was easier than explaining , demonstrating , and then redoing the whole task when Skye was n't around . " You 'll stay , wo n't you ? " Skye demanded , beaming up at Trace . " Please , say you 'll stay ! " He did n't so much as glance in Bridget 's direction , which , she assured herself impotently , was a good thing for him . " I 'm not going anywhere . " Behind the cabin , in the makeshift corral Bridget had constructed from barrels and fallen branches , the new horse neighed . He was her one great hope of earning a living , that spectacular black and white paint . She 'd swapped both oxen for him , barely a week before , when a half dozen Paiute braves had paid her an alarming visit . His name , rightfully enough , was Windfall , for she 'd certainly gotten the best of the trade . Granddaddy would have been proud . People would pay good money to have their mares bred to a magnificent horse like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grassy shade of a wild oak tree nearby , replied to the stallion 's call with a companionable nicker . A muscle pulsed in Trace 's jaw . Even after all that time and trouble , flowing between them like a river , she could still read him plain as the Territorial Enterprise . If there were horses around , Trace was invariably drawn to them . He was known for his ability to train untrainable animals , to win their trust and even their affection . All of which made her wonder that much more how he 'd come to be walking instead of riding . " Where 's the boy ? " he asked . " I 'd like to see him . " Bridget sighed . Maybe if he got a look at Noah , he 'd leave . If there was any justice in the world , the child 's likeness to his martyred father would be enough to shame even Trace into moving on . " He 's inside , taking his nap , " she said shortly , and gestured toward the cabin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know . Skye had many sterling traits , but minding her tongue was n't among them . " That 's a long story , " Trace answered . He was already on his way toward the open door of the cabin , and Skye hurried along beside him . " It ends badly , too . " He paused at the threshold to kick off his wet boots . " Tell me , " Skye insisted . Her delight caused a bittersweet spill in Bridget 's heart ; the girl had been withdrawn and sorrowful ever since they 'd buried Granddaddy and headed west to claim their share of the only thing he 'd had left to bequeath : a twenty-five-hundred-acre tract of land in the high country of Nevada , sprawled along both sides of a stream called Primrose Creek . Too much loss . They had all seen too much loss , too much grief . Trace stepped over the high threshold and into the tiny house , just as if he had the right to enter . The place was twelve by twelve , reason enough for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an invited guest . Which , of course , he was n't . " He took off , " he said . " Nothing but a knothead , that horse . " Bridget , following on their heels , did n't believe a word of it , but she was n't about to stir up another argument by saying so . Trace would have known better than to take up with a stupid horse , though she was n't so sure about his taste in women . He 'd probably lost the animal in a game of some sort , for he was inclined to take reckless chances and always had been . Noah , a shy but willful child , so like Mitch , with his wavy brown hair and mischievous hazel eyes , that it still struck Bridget like a blow whenever she looked at him , sat up in the middle of the big bedstead , rubbing his eyes with plump little fists and then peering at Trace in the dim , cool light . " Papa , " he said . " That 's my papa . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked away . She would have corrected her son , but she did n't trust herself to speak . Trace crossed the small room and reached out for the boy , who scrambled readily into his arms . The little traitor . " Well , " Trace said , his voice thick with apparent emotion . " Hullo , there . " " He calls everybody ' Papa , ' " Bridget blurted , and then , mortified , turned to the stove and busied herself with pots and kettles , so Trace would n't see her expression . Trace chuckled and set his hat on the boy 's head , covering him to the shoulders , and Noah 's delighted giggle echoed from inside . " Does he , now ? " " Some of the folks in town think Bridget is a fallen woman , " Skye announced . " On account of her name still being McQuarry , even though she was married to Mitch . I told her she ought to explain how he was a distant cousin , but  --  " " Skye , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early to fix supper , and yet there she was , ladling bear fat into a pan to fry up greens and onions and what was left of the cornmeal mush they 'd had for breakfast . Trace came to stand beside her , her son crowing in his arms , evidently delighted at being swallowed up in a hat . " He sure does take after Mitch , " Trace said . His voice was quiet , low . Bridget did n't dare even to glance up at him . " More so every day , " she agreed , striving for a light note . " I would n't say he 's easygoing like Mitch was , though . He 's got himself a strong will , and something of a temper , too . " " That , " Trace said , " would have come from you . " " Skye , " Bridget said crisply , as though he had n't spoken , " go and catch a chicken if you can . And take Noah with you , please . " Skye obeyed without comment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tasks just assigned were in direct conflict with each other . Noah protested a bit , though , not wanting to be parted from Trace  --  or , perhaps , his hat . Then they were alone in the small , shadowy space , side by side . Bridget could feel Trace 's gaze resting on her face , but meeting his eyes took some doing . Every time she looked at him , it weakened her somehow , made her want to sit down and fan herself like some scatterbrained girl at a cotillion . " Why did you come here ? " she demanded . His expression was solemn and , at the same time , intractable . " Because I promised Mitch I would , " he said . " Two days before he was drowned , he got your letter telling him Noah had been born . He was happy , of course , but it was hard for him , being so far away . After a while , he turned reflective . " Trace paused , rubbed the back of his neck with one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after you , if he did n't make it home . " Bridget knew the details of Mitch 's drowning  --  Trace had described the scene to her in a letter , his words so vivid that she sometimes forgot that she had n't been there , had n't witnessed the tragedy herself  --  but the mention of his death brought stinging tears to her eyes all the same . " Damn you , " she whispered . " Have n't you done enough ? " He took the spatula from her hand and , grasping her shoulders gently , turned her to face him . " What the devil do you mean by that ? " he demanded in a hoarse whisper . " You know what I mean , " Bridget hissed back . " If it had n't been for you , Mitch would never have gone to war . Noah and I would n't have to make our way without him . How dare you come here , like some storybook knight in shining armor , when  --  when  --  " " When it was all my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The words were knife-sharp , for all their softness , honed to a dangerous edge . It was no use trying to hide her tears , so she did n't make the attempt . For some reason , it seemed all right to cry in front of Trace , though she 'd taken great care in the years since the war began to make sure she was alone when she could no longer control her emotions . " Yes ! " she cried . " Yes ! Mitch was n't like you . He was guileless and sweet , and he believed everyone else was just as good , just as honest , just as kind . He would have done practically anything you asked him to , and damn you , Trace , you had to know that ! " Trace shoved a hand through that shaggy , light-streaked hair of his . He needed barbering in the worst way , clean clothes , and a bath , too , and for all that , Bridget felt the ancient shame , the powerful , secret pull toward him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely acknowledge it to herself . " Mitch had a mind of his own , " he rasped . In his eyes , the ghosts of a hundred fallen soldiers flickered , one of them his best friend from earliest memory . " You make him sound like some kind of idiot . I did n't make him join the fight  --  he knew it was something he had to do . Hell , we all did . " They stared at each other for a long moment , like winter-starved bears fixing to tie in , tooth and claw . The air seemed to buzz and crackle at Bridget 's ears , and she could feel her own heartbeat thundering in every part of her body . She told herself it was anger and nothing else . Nothing else . " He had a wife and a child , " she said finally . Shakily . " Granddaddy needed him on the farm . We needed him . " " Sweet Lord in heaven , Bridget , " Trace reasoned with weary patience , " just about everybody had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you think you were the only one who made sacrifices ? " Sacrifices ? What did he know about sacrifices , with his ready smile and the whole of his life still ahead of him ? Bridget wanted to slap the man , but she managed to hold on to her dignity . It would n't do to set a bad example for Skye and Noah by resorting to violence , however great the temptation . She sniffed . " I should have known that you would n't accept responsibility . " He leaned in until his nose was barely an inch from hers . His eyes seemed to flash with blue and green sparks . " I 'll ' accept responsibility ' for anything that 's my doing , " he snapped , " but I 'll be damned if I 'll let you blame the whole war on me ! " " I do n't see how you can stop me , " Bridget pointed out . " And I 'll thank you not to use profane language in my house . " Color surged up Trace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You have n't changed , you know that ? " And then , just as suddenly as his whole countenance had turned to fury , he grinned , all jovial good nature . " It 's good to know that some things  --  and some people  --  stay the same . " Bridget was reconsidering her previous decision not to slap him . " You ca n't stay here , " she insisted . " It 's simply out of the question . " She looked around at the humble dwelling , with its dirt floor and oil-barrel cookstove , perhaps a little desperately . Even the bed had been scavenged along the westward trail , left behind by some other family . " This place is hardly big enough for Skye and Noah and me as it is  --  there 'll be talk in town  --  " " I 'll make camp down by the creek , " he said . " And if folks have anything to say about my being here , you just send them to me . " He heaved a sigh . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at those horses of yours , if that 's all right with you . " " As if you cared one whit about my opinion on anything , " Bridget huffed . He was still grinning . It was an unfair advantage , that disarming smile of his , bright as noonday sun spilling across clear water . " I 've missed you , " he said , and then he turned , and when Bridget let herself look , he was gone . Damned if it was n't Sentinel , his own horse , penned in behind Bridget 's tumbledown shack of a house . At the sight of Trace , the stallion tossed his head and ambled over to greet him with a hard nuzzle to the shoulder . Trace stroked the stallion 's white-splashed brow and spoke in a low voice . " I was afraid our paths might never cross again , fella , " he confided . The goose egg on the back of his head pulsed , a reminder of the morning ten days before , when a pack of renegade Paiutes had jumped him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold , probably with the butt of an army rifle , before he had time to think , but he supposed he ought to be grateful they had n't relieved him of his boots , saddle , and watch while he was still facedown in the dirt . Not to mention his hair . Sentinel blew affectionately , and Trace chuckled . " Looks like Miss Bridget 's gone to no little trouble to keep you here , " he observed , looking askance at the flimsy arrangement of branches and barrels posing as a corral fence . " I guess we ought n't to tell her you could have gotten out of this with one good kick . You were waiting for me , were n't you , boy ? " Again , the horse nickered , as if to reply in the affirmative . Trace glanced toward the house ; even from outside , he could hear Bridget banging pots and kettles around . He turned his head , saw Skye and Noah chasing a squawking chicken around in the high grass , and smiled at the sight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a fine boy , your Noah . " Skye ! " Bridget called . She was probably in the dooryard , but Trace could n't see her for the cabin . " Stop that nonsense before you run the meat right off that bird ! " Trace looked heavenward . I 'll do my best , he promised . Then he turned back to the horse and patted its long , glistening neck . " You and I , we 'll just pretend we 're strangers for a while , " he said quietly . The paint pawed the ground with one foreleg and flung his head , but Trace knew he 'd go along with the plan , insofar as a horse could be expected to do . Obediently , Skye closed in on the chicken and held it in both arms , and even from that distance , Trace could make out the bleak expression in her eyes . He moved toward her . " I do n't want to kill it , " she confessed , and bit her lower lip . When she grew to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trace 's eyes , and maybe she always would be  --  she would make some lucky man an exceptional wife . " I 'll do it , " he said . " You take the boy inside before he meets up with a rattler . " Skye nodded and smiled up at him with her eyes . " Thanks , Trace , " she said softly , and leaned down to take Noah 's small hand . Then , tentatively , she touched Trace 's arm . " I 'm glad you 're here . Bridget is , too , even if she ca n't make herself admit it . You wo n't let her run you off , will you ? " He glanced toward the cabin , with its pitiful canvas roof . Bridget had gone back inside to slam things around some more . That woman was hell on hardware . " She always make this much noise when she cooks ? " Skye laughed and shook her head . " No , sir . That particular commotion is in your honor for sure and certain , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet grass , the boy scrambling along behind her . That night , sitting on stumps and crates under a black sky prickled with stars , they ate fried chicken for supper , along with cornmeal cakes and greens , and Trace could not recall a finer meal . He probably had n't had home-cooked food since before he joined the army , though he 'd developed a taste for it as a boy . All the while he was growing up , he 'd eaten with the McQuarrys whenever he was invited , which was often . Even back then , before she picked up and left , his mother had n't troubled herself much where such things were concerned . Tillie Qualtrough had been a loose woman , plain and simple , and she 'd taken to camp following long before the war came and made a profitable enterprise of the habit . All things taken into consideration , though , he could n't see any sense in faulting Tillie for the choices she 'd made . She 'd been alone in the world , with nothing to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to , that was all , and despite her circumstances , which would have turned a lot of people bitter , she 'd been kind-hearted and quick to laugh . " That 's a fine stallion you 've got there , " Trace observed , when he 'd eaten all he decently could . It seemed a safe topic to him , unrelated as it was to Mitch or to his staying on at Primrose Creek . " Where 'd you get him ? " Bridget 's face softened at the mention of the animal ; ever since she was a little girl , she 'd loved critters the way some people do art or music or going to church . " I swapped the oxen for him , " she said , obviously proud of the deal . " I mean to breed him to my mare , Sis , and some others and eventually start myself a horse ranch . " Trace raised his blue enamel coffee mug to his mouth , more because he wanted to hide his smile than because he needed any more of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was , remembering . Regretting . " I see , " he said . " I guess you would n't consider plain farming . " She sat up straight on the crate she 'd taken for a chair , her half-filled plate forgotten on her lap . " Farming , " she scoffed . " This is timber country . Mining country . Ranch country . " " We 've got a nice vegetable patch , though , " Skye put in , and there was an anxious note in her voice , putting Trace in mind of somebody stepping between two opposing forces in the faint hope of keeping them from colliding . " Potatoes . Squash  --  " Her words fell away , like pebbles vanishing down the side of a precipice . " You might not turn a profit for some time , " Trace observed , watching Bridget . " How do you intend to eat this winter ? " He knew he 'd touched a nerve , for all that she tried to disguise the fact with her trademark bravado . " We might sell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house and a sawmill at the edge of town , and he 'll be wanting trees . " Trace assessed the towering ponderosa pines and firs surrounding them , blue-black shadows marching as far as the eye could see , in every direction . " Does n't look to me like he 'd have any trouble getting all the lumber he wanted , " he said . He did n't mean there would n't be a market for McQuarry timber  --  not exactly , anyway  --  but Bridget took it that way and ruffled her feathers like a little partridge , making it necessary to take another sip of coffee . " We have flour and salt . We have a shotgun for hunting , and thanks to a friend in town , we 've got enough chickens to provide eggs and "  --  she looked down at her food  --  " the occasional feast . We will do just fine , thank you . " Trace suppressed a sigh . He 'd known this encounter would n't be easy , but he 'd been afoot for the best part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much time in the saddle that for a while there , he 'd thought he might turn bow-legged . He was in no mood to grapple with a stiff-backed little spitfire like Bridget McQuarry . You promised , Mitch 's memory reminded him . Yes , damn it , I promised . And I 'll keep my word . " I 'll need some timber for that roof , " he said in measured tones . " You have a saw ? An ax , at least ? " Bridget pursed her lips , just briefly , but she looked pretty , even in a sour pose . Motherhood lent her a softness of the sort a man ca n't really help noticing , no matter how hard he might try . " We can build our own roof , " she said . " Skye and I will do it ourselves . " Trace rolled his eyes , but he kept a hold on his patience . Skye offered no comment but busied herself gathering up a fretful Noah and herding him inside to be swabbed down and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , too , " he said dryly , nodding to indicate the canvas stretched across the top of the house . " Roof building , I mean . " Even in the thickening twilight , he saw her color heighten . It made something grind painfully , deep inside him , seeing that . Instead of speaking , though , she just got up and started collecting the tin plates . " Why ca n't you just admit that you need help ? " he asked , very quietly . She straightened , and he saw  --  or thought he saw  --  tears glimmering in her eyes . " Oh , I can admit that , Mr. Qualtrough , " she said . " I 've got a child and a young sister to feed and clothe . I have this house and this land and two horses and nothing else . I need help , all right . I just do n't need it from you . " He sighed again . " You hate me that much ? " " No , " she answered , stiffening that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " You have to have a roof , Bridget . My being here would mean protection for Skye and Noah , if you wo n't accept it for yourself . And somebody has to train that stallion . You 're good with horses , you always were , but you 're too small to handle him , and you know it . " She was silent . He pressed the advantage . " This is what Mitch wanted , " he said reasonably . " How can I ignore that ? How can you ? " The plates rattled in her hands , and she would n't look at him . " You 'll train the stallion  --  put on a roof  --  build a barn ? " " That and more , " he agreed . She caught her upper lip between her teeth , something she 'd done ever since he could remember . And that was a long time , since the McQuarry farm had bordered the little patch of no-account land where Trace and his mother had lived in what had once been slave quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things , and we 'll be all right . It 'll ease your conscience , and you 'll move on like you ought . " He stood , faced her , cupped her chin in one hand . " What are you so scared of , Bridge ? " he asked . " You must know you have nothing to fear from me , not on your account and not on Skye 's . " Her eyes flashed in the starlight ; for a moment , he thought she was going to insult his honor by saying she was afraid of him , but when it came down to cases , she nodded . " I know that , " she whispered . " It 's just that  --  well , every time I look at you , I think of Mitch . I think of how he might have stayed home  --  " Trace let her chin go . " Stayed home and done what ? " he asked , at the edge of his patience . " Planted cotton and corn and sweet potatoes ? Milked cows ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our discussing this , " she said , her tone on the peevish side . Then she snatched the coffee mug out of his hand , turned , and strode toward the cabin . If the boy had n't been asleep by then , or close to it , anyway , he knew she 'd have slammed the door smartly behind her . He watched as the lanterns winked out inside the house , first one , and then the other , and the sight gave him a lonely feeling , as if he were set apart from everything warm and sweet and good . It was n't the first time he 'd felt like that ; as a boy , he 'd yearned to be one of the McQuarrys , instead of some long-gone stranger 's illegitimate son . During the war , far from the land and the people he knew , he 'd ached inside , ached to go back to the Shenandoah Valley . After Mitch was drowned in the river that day , his horse shot out from under him , things had been a whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat there , mourning . Then , slowly , he turned his back on the cabin and headed for the makeshift camp he 'd set up a hundred yards away , in the shelter of several tall oak trees growing alongside the creek . Rummaging in his saddlebags , he got out his spare shirt and a sliver of yellow soap . He kicked off his boots , still damp from his crossing earlier in the day , and then , downstream a little way , where he was sure he was out of sight of the house , he shed his clothes and waded , teeth chattering , into the icy waters of Primrose Creek . He made necessarily quick work of his bath , dried off with his dirty shirt , and pulled his trousers back on , his mind occupied , the whole time , with Bridget . God only knew what she 'd say when he told her they were getting married .
