Chapter One Storm Novelo stared at the computer screen . It was Saturday morning , and she should have been at the mall . Or better yet , still in bed . Anywhere , except here at Gracie 's mother 's cottage , blogging for the website . " Might as well get typing , " Annie Lind suggested . " We 're not letting you out of the room until you finish your column . " Even in her jogging suit , Annie had style . Shoulder-length auburn hair framed her giant blue eyes and tiny nose . " I still ca n't believe you guys would kidnap a person just because she 's a little late with her trivia column , " Storm complained . " Is n't there a law against kidnapping ? " Okay , so she was two weeks late on her contribution to That 's What You Think ! Big deal . Annie turned a page of her teen magazine . Usually , she was late with her " Professor Love " advice column . Only not today . She was totally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs dangling over the arm of the big white chair . Storm figured her own legs would n't have dangled at all . At five-ten , Annie was a good eight inches taller than Storm . " Do n't know about that kidnapping law , " Annie said . " But according to Gracie , there is a law against being late with your column . " That 's What You Think ! had been Grace Doe 's idea all the way . She 'd beenblogging her observations a long time before she got the rest of the team on board . Gracie had a way of reading people by observing subtle gestures and signs . In the beginning , Storm had thought being part of a website group rocked . But now she was getting bored with it , like she did with everything . At least this project had lasted longer than most . And she 'd made some great friends in the process . Gracie , Annie , Jazz , and Mick - the other members of the blog team - were as good of friends as Storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Storm thought back to her first impressions of Big Lake , Ohio . This time her dad 's endless search for lawn-care jobs had taken them to a town with no lake , in spite of the name , and a skyline that offered nothing but trees and a water tower . Still , something about the town had felt right . It might have been because the whole town , especially Big Lake High School , where Storm enrolled as a freshman , seemed so familiar . As it turned out , the school was familiar . Before the move , Storm had been reading dozens of web logs . She thought of them as open diaries on the Internet . Her favorite blog had been That 's What You Think ! by someone calling herself " Jane . " Jane wrote about a school she dubbed " Typical High . " Once Storm started attending classes at Big Lake High School , it had n't taken her long to figure out that " Typical High " was actually Big Lake High and Grace Doe , a sophomore at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gotten off to a rough start . But in the end , Gracie had invited her to join the blog team . Storm 's job was to write a column called " Didyanose , " as in " Did You Know ? " She just wrote trivia , spilling out some of the facts that rolled around in her head all the time . At first , she 'd loved having an outlet for her trivia because it cut down on her too-smart-sounding outbursts in classes . But lately , the whole thing had definitely been getting old . Case in point : this week 's column on body image . Writing facts about the human body should have been a snap . Storm knew thousands of facts and lots of trivia about the body . She could spout them off the top of her head . She read everything - encyclopedias , hospital brochures , bulletin boards , medical sites on the Internet . She could n't help herself . She even read cereal boxes , car instruction manuals , labels on household cleaning products , and the fine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they never would . " Finished yet , Storm ? " Gracie strolled from the kitchen , munching on a bagel that smelled like it had peanut butter on it . " Getting there , " Storm answered . " But do n't try to read over my shoulder or I 'll never get it . Anyway , should n't we be going to the supermarket ? " She and Gracie worked as baggers at Big Lake Foods , although Storm was seriously considering quitting . She was tired of bagging groceries and making small talk with customers , even though she 'd loved the job at first . " You have two hours before your shift starts , Storm , " Gracie said , taking a big bite of bagel . " Use them . " " So where 's Jazz ? " Storm asked , stalling . " She 's already turned in her cartoon , " Gracie explained , not taking the bait . " And in case you 're wondering , Mick 's coming by after practice so she can upload all of our columns to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the computer genius who kept the website running . She was also the only girl on the Big Lake Middle School baseball team . As soon as Gracie went upstairs , Storm did a computer search until she found Gracie 's latest blog . This was their second blog on the " body " because they 'd gotten so many great emails after the first one . Storm leaned back in the computer chair and read : * * * THAT 'S WHAT YOU THINK ! By Jane NOVEMBER 1 SUBJECT : YOU Does every female wear a size 2 ? Or is it just that only size 2 women appear on TV , and we think that 's the norm ? Where are those TV censors when you really need them ? I think we should all write our local stations and have them ban the airwaves carrying programs in which TV actresses wear anything smaller than a 9 or 10 . Did it ever occur to them that we were n't all supposed to have the same body ? Just imagine what life would be like if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all buff and muscle-bound . And we all had great hair . Then how would we know who was more desirable ? Who to make homecoming king and queen ? Who to envy ? We 'd have to make up other things-like who had the straightest toes , or the thickest eyebrows or something . What would happen if we worried that much about our insides ? At Typical High today , in one 5-minute period between classes , I observed 22 hair checks . I heard 2 girls ask the fat question : " Do you think this makes me look fat ? " And I observed 3 guys making a gorilla attempt to thrust out their chests when a size 2 girl strolled by . On the other hand , accepting your body does n't necessarily mean flaunting it . Why does every girl feel she has to wear those short , belly-revealing tops , when 90% of us would like for that little roll of fat to be invisible ? Storm skimmed the rest of the rant . As usual , Mick had posted a Bible verse after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's womb . I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made . ( Psalm 139:13 , 14 ) Most days Storm believed that - that God actually created everybody . Her parents went to church service every week , but they did n't make Storm go anymore . She had to hunt for Jazz 's latest cartoon , but she finally found the scanned-in copy , ready to be uploaded to the site . It was a picture of a clown , with a little boy biting the clown 's hand . The word balloon above the boy 's head read , " Huh . ( Continues ... )
