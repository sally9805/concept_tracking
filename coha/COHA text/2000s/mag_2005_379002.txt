One day soon , this somber young man plans to offer up a final prayer and then blow himself up along with as many U.S. or Iraqi soldiers as he can reach . Marwan Abu Ubeida says he has been training for months to carry out a suicide mission . He does n't know when or where he will be ordered to climb into a bomb-laden vehicle or strap on an explosives-filled vest but says he is eager for the moment to come . While he waits , he spends much of his time rehearsing that last prayer . " First I will ask Allah to bless my mission with a high rate of casualties among the Americans , " he says , speaking softly in a matter-of-fact monotone , as if dictating a shopping list . " Then I will ask him to purify my soul so I am fit to see him , and I will ask to see my mujahedin brothers who are already with him . " He pauses to run the list through his mind again , then resumes : " The most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans . " <P> At 20 , Marwan is already a battle-hardened insurgent , a jihadi foot soldier in Abu Mousab al-Zarqawi 's terrorist group , al-Qaeda in Iraq . Like the bulk of insurgents , he is a Sunni Muslim from the former ruling minority community . In his hometown , Fallujah , he is known for his ferociousness in battle and deep religiosity . Marwan asked his commander to consider him for a suicide mission last fall but had to wait until the beginning of April for his name to be put on the list of volunteers . " When he finally agreed , " Marwan recalls , " it was the happiest day of my life . " There are , he says , scores of names on that list , and it can be months before a volunteer is assigned an operation . But at the current high rate of attacks , Marwan hopes he will be called up soon . " I ca n't wait , " he says , rubbing his thumbs with his fingers in nervous energy . " I am ready to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's not hard to find young men who talk the terrorist talk , boasting of their willingness to serve as human bombs . It 's hard to judge the speakers ' sincerity . But the latest surge of suicide operations proves there is no scarcity of volunteers to become the most lethal weapon Iraq 's insurgents have . Since May 1 , Iraq has witnessed at least 129 suicide attacks , accounting for several of the estimated 150 U.S. fatalities during this period , including as many as six soldiers killed in an attack of their convoy near Fallujah last week . Most of the 1,200 Iraqis killed by insurgents since May 1 have died in suicide bombings . And yet , despite the frequency and deadliness of their attacks , almost nothing is known about individual bombers . Their identities have rarely been revealed and then only posthumously , on jihadist websites or carefully edited videotapes aimed at promoting the insurgent cause and attracting fresh recruits . Among the few who have been named , most are foreigners , many from Saudi Arabia .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
