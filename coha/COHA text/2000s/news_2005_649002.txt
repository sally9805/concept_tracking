<p> There is change and then there is evolution , and the difference between the two explains the curious and sudden appearance of a points explosion in the N.B.A. <p> Scoring this season spiked from coast to coast . The jump-shot jubilee was led by the rollicking Phoenix Suns , who literally sprinted to the league 's best record , then claimed trophies for the most valuable player ( Steve Nash ) and the coach of the year ( Mike D'Antoni ) . <p> Like a contagion , the higher scores spread from city to city until even the supposed slow pokes of the league , San Antonio and Detroit , hit the century mark with some regularity . <p> If the story ended there , it would be just another hiccup in league history , a strange uptick on the statistical charts , and the Suns would be just another one-year wonder . <p> But what happened this season , with six teams averaging at least 100 points a game , was neither sudden nor transitory . <p> It was deliberate and it was planned , through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aided by an influx of new talent on the court and , finally , abetted by coaches who saw no choice but to adapt . <p> This is the game the N.B.A. wanted when it overhauled its defensive rules four years ago . It just needed several more tweaks and some fine tuning to get it here . <p> " As far as the way the game looks and the way it 's being played , it 's really in a good place , " said Stu Jackson , the N.B.A. senior vice president for basketball operations . <p> The Suns are the model , an entertaining throwback to the 1980 's , a modern-day reflection of the Los Angeles Lakers ' " Showtime " era . But five other teams joined them in averaging at least 100 points this season , and the league average of 194.4 points a game was the highest in five years . Even the N.B.A. 's deeply ingrained conventional wisdom has not stopped the trend . <p> Scoring has historically declined in the playoffs , but not this year . Through Wednesday 's games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a 3-point increase over the regular-season average , and an incredible 21-point increase over the 2004 playoffs . <p> The trend is not limited to the Suns and other run-and-gun practitioners like the Dallas Mavericks and Seattle SuperSonics . <p> The Detroit Pistons , who muscled their way to the 2004 championship with bruising defense , are averaging 96.1 points in these playoffs , a 9-point increase over their 2004 postseason average . The San Antonio Spurs , long known as a half-court team with a defensive bent , are averaging 101.9 points , a 12-point increase over their 2004 average . <p> " Teams are playing faster , " Sonics Coach Nate McMillan said . " They 've changed their style . You do n't see as many teams playing a primary half-court game . " <p> The statistics give the appearance of an overnight transformation . But the revolution has been emerging in subtle steps for four years . <p> In 2001 , the N.B.A. scrapped its illegal-defense rule , which generally dictated that each defender be attached to a specific offensive player ( with or without the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players standing still on one side of the court while a skilled ball-handler went one-on-one with his defender on the other side . <p> These " clear-outs " were deemed unsightly and bad for the game . <p> " It was boring , and it was n't the intent of how the game should be played , " said Jerry Colangelo , the Suns ' chairman and chief executive officer . Colangelo recalled telling Commissioner David Stern , " If I get turned off , it 's a serious problem . " <p> Colangelo headed a committee that called for elimination of the illegal-defense rule and the introduction , for the first time , of zone defense to the N.B.A. The committee also cut the time allotted to advance the ball from the back court , from 10 seconds to 8 . <p> " We were going to try to dictate a faster game , " Colangelo said . <p> At the time , many coaches and players assailed the changes . Pat Riley , the Miami coach at the time , called them " a huge mistake , " saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's most entertaining feature  --  flashy drives to the hoop . ( Colangelo 's committee instituted a 3-second rule for defenders in the lane to address that concern . ) <p> Rather than impede the game , zone defense arguably has helped foster the offensive renaissance by giving teams more incentive to score on fast breaks . <p> " Coaches like the idea of running the ball and getting into an early offense before the defense is set , " said Washington Wizards Coach Eddie Jordan . " Because they can get set in a zone and slow you up . So it 's all about fast break , early offense , fast break , early offense . " <p> The new defensive rules went into effect for the 2001-2 season . Two years later , the league 's offense bottomed out , with a .421 field-goal percentage in the playoffs and an average combined score of 176.1 points a game . That was not the result anyone wanted , but in the N.B.A. , evolution is slow . <p> Coaches needed time to teach zone defense , and players needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed to learn how to attack zones , through better ball and player movement . <p> " I think since the major rule changes of three and a half , four years ago , style-wise , we 've become a better ball movement league , " said the Indiana Pacers ' coach , Rick Carlisle . " We 've become a higher basketball I.Q. league . " <p> Dwayne Casey , a Sonics assistant , agreed . <p> " The new rules have given players more freedom of movement , " he said . " The fact that there are no illegal defenses has increased ball movement and increased man movement that make it hard to defend . And more coaches are relinquishing control . You look at Phoenix , the coaches give up control of the offensive set . That 's no disrespect to the coaches , but a lot of plays you just ca n't really design a defense for . That makes for more points . I think players today are better offense players . Shooting has improved . Ball-handling has improved . " <p> Yet it took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produce the point-a-palooza . <p> Last fall , the league highlighted two areas for enforcement by referees . The league put more onus on defenders to establish position before drawing a charging foul , which led to more blocking calls and more incentive for players to drive to the rim . And the league instructed referees to tighten enforcement of forearm checking by perimeter defenders . <p> In past years , the league had cracked down on hand-checking , but players adapted . <p> " Defenders then started to use their forearm in the shoulder area and hip area of offensive players in an effort to re-route the offensive player or to slow them , " Jackson said . " Forearms started to creep into the game . " <p> Again , there was howling in some quarters . " Rules Changes Could Hurt Pistons , " declared a headline in The Detroit News . The Pistons won the championship in part by setting a league record for fewest points allowed ( 83.4 per game ) . <p> " I do n't understand , " Pistons guard Chauncey Billups said then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not try to make it softer . " <p> But the Pistons , who are battling the Pacers in the Eastern Conference semifinals , adapted along with everyone else . A league once dominated by the defensive preachings of Riley and Chuck Daly is now being personified by the fast-and-loose approach of D'Antoni . <p> " The coaches are letting their players play , " Stern said . " It 's all about the coaches . " <p> No one is more pleased than Colangelo , who said he always believed it would take several seasons for his committee 's rules changes to make their full impact . <p> " Now we 're starting to see the benefit , " Colangelo said . " The game looks better . " <p> So are the higher scores and fast-paced offense here to stay ? Jackson said he was " cautiously optimistic . " <p> " I really feel it 's an evolution and a journey , " he said . " Our players and our coaches , they 're the best in the world . And they find ways , new ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And if there 's another defensive scheme or another technique to be used , they 'll find it . It 's really incumbent upon us at the league level to monitor it and be nimble , to adjust if we need to .
