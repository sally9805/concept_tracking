June 2007 , England <p> The road south out of Little Stanhope village could have been any one of hundreds that spider the picturesque Thames valley , south of the city of Oxford : narrow , with dense hedgerows  --  often blocking the view on both sides  --  and fraught with unremitting curves . <p> To anyone following the Vincent Black Lightning motorcycle , it would be apparent that the leather-jacketed rider was familiar with the quirky road , its capricious twists and turns . Allowing for the light drizzle , he maintained a steady but not excessive speed , barely slowing for some of the shallow bends , and swaying fluidly from one side to the other , like a boxer dodging blows , as he coaxed the sleek machine through the blind hairpins . <p> He was headed for the market town of Wallingford , one of many picture-postcard towns and villages that straddle the Thames on its slow-.owing journey southeast to Windsor , thence to London , and to the sea . <p> Despite his familiarity with the road , he knew that concentration was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the driver of an oncoming vehicle , would be slender . Physically and mentally committed , setting up his line through a particularly long curve , he was at first unaware of the car that had appeared suddenly from behind . Only when he emerged from the curve , accelerating for the straight stretch of road ahead , did he spot the fast-approaching car in his side mirror . <p> He heard a swish of tires on the wet road and glanced over his shoulder to see that the dark-colored car had closed the gap and was now on his tail . He sensed a road rage situation in the making but was in no mood for a confrontation  --  or the inclination to outrun the car , which would have been easy . He slowed and pulled over to the left as far as the narrow road would permit . The hedgerow leaves whipped the sleeve of his jacket as he beckoned for the car to pass . He glanced in his mirror again to see why the driver , a man wearing a cap and wraparound sunglasses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Suddenly the hedgerow stopped ; in its place was a raised grass verge with a post-and-barbed-wire fence farther back . The road widened , too , and there was no oncoming traffic . Now the drizzle had turned to rain . Wiping his face shield with his glove , the bike rider waved again for the car to pass . At last it accelerated and pulled alongside . <p> The rider glanced to his right , curious to get a closer look at the hot-footed driver , careful to make it quick . He was n't about to give the man the slightest reason to think that he was being challenged . <p> The instant their eyes met , the car swerved hard to its left , slamming the rear wheel of the bike , spinning the 450-pound machine into the verge . Sliding on the slick road , it careered off the grassy mound in a twisting somersault , hurling the rider several feet into the air . The bike landed first , fragments of metal , chrome , and glass showering the road . Two seconds later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the ground . He crossed his arms in front of his face , but it did little good . His helmet hit the tarmac with a sickening crack , and his body rolled several feet before coming to rest facedown , unmoving . <p> An eerie silence fell on the scene . The white sound of gentle rain was foreboding . <p> Then flames started to lick around the ruptured tank . <p> Suddenly , a roaring explosion , as the motorcycle 's twisted remains erupted into a searing ball of flame and smoke . <p> With a screech of tires and the smell of burning rubber , the car sped off . <p> Approximately forty-five minutes later , an NHS Oxfordshire ambulance arrived at the Accident and Emergency unit of St. George 's Hospital on the outskirts of Oxford , where the unidentified rider , on life support , was rushed to the trauma center . <p> Excerpted from The Trail of the Wild Rose by Anthony Eglin <p> Copyright 2009 by Anthony Eglin <p> Published in April 2009 by St. Martin        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
