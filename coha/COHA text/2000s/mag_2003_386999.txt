Section : THE BEST OF THE SUGAR BOWL <p> An Oklahoma victory in the Sugar Bowl may appear inevitable , But LSU , with its unexpected offensive stars and blitz-happy defense , not only belongs in the BCS championship game - it will win it . <p> The kid quarterback in L.A. never threw a pass in a college game before this season , but he already had a model/TV star/pro surfer for a girlfriend . Now Matt Leinart is the most eligible bachelor in SoCal and an All-American . Across the way in Oklahoma is a fifth-year senior quarter-back who won the Heisman Trophy in a painted , poignant story of Americana . Could n't script Jason White 's season better if you had a few Oscars in your pocket . <p> Then there 's Matt Mauck , the other quarterback on the other team in college football 's postseason storm . He is thinking about forgoing his senior season next year . Wants to go to dental school . Wants to get an early start and maybe set up shop one day in his hometown of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best small towns in America , " it boasts - and be something to someone every time he goes to work . " Not everything is how it seems , " Mauck says . As if this guy belongs with Leinart and White and all of this bowl madness . Then again , LSU does n't fit in either , right ? The human polls love Southern California , the computers are hitched to Oklahoma , and the Tigers may as well be a speed bump on the road to a BCS breakdown . <p> " Crazy how we luck into everything , huh ? " LSU defensive tackle Chad Lavalais says , the sarcasm as heavy as his nearly-300-pound frame . <p> It would be easy to pencil in a Sooners victory in the Sugar Bowl . It 's not often a Bob Stoops-coached OU team has lost to a team in the top 10 ( only once ) or failed to find redemption after a poorly played game . But this is most certainly different . LSU is just as good defensively as Oklahoma and is more balanced offensively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Superdome is a home game for the Tigers - ask Miami if those 60,000-plus Ohio State fans were a factor in last year 's Fiesta Bowl - and that LSU is peaking . <p> LSU 's only national title came in 1958 , when Paul Dietzel 's team finished an 11-0 season with a 7-0 win over Clemson in the Sugar Bowl . That 's not the most significant football event in Louisiana history , however . An " eyewitness " description of Billy Cannon 's punt return for a touchdown against Ole Miss on Halloween night a year later always has been required listening for any boy growing up on the Bayou . Now they 'll be daydreaming about a team that found a way to play for the national title - then made it stick by winning the biggest game in school history . <p> Spring practice was winding down in April at LSU , and not a thing was going right . The staff was n't too excited about the pace or energy in many of the 15 NCAA-allowed practices , and the defense - fiery coach Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We were a little stressed , " says defensive coordinator Will Muschamp . <p> Lavalais was coming off an inconsistent junior season and was miles from a senior year in which he was named the SPORTING NEWS Defensive Player of the Year . The linebackers were inexperienced because the 2002 Tigers played too much nickel coverage and did n't find enough playing time for key backups . And the secondary - good God , the secondary - played horribly down the stretch in 2002 , allowing a last-second gift touchdown to Arkansas that kept the Tigers from winning the SEC West Division and looking like a rag-tag group of high school kids in an ugly loss to Texas in the Cotton Bowl . <p> So what 's a defensive coordinator to do ? Blitz . When inexperience and indecision overshadow knowledge of the scheme , the answer is finding more blitz packages and adding more pressure . And unlike most coaches , Saban believes the more you pressure players to perform , the better they respond . <p> Desperate for a playmaker in the secondary midway through this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of Landry 's speed and cover skills and because he hits like a linebacker in run support . The increased focus on pressure created havoc and forced a talented but underachieving defensive line to become more active and accountable . By the end of the 34-13 victory over Georgia in the SEC championship game , the Tigers had collected 39 sacks and 31 turnovers in 13 games . The championship game was the 11th time this season their opponent was held to 14 or fewer points . <p> " You hold any team to two touchdowns and that 's money , " says end Marquise Hill . <p> Well , it just so happens that Oklahoma has scored at least 50 points seven times this season . Kansas State slowed the Oklahoma offense in the Big 12 championship game by getting a strong push from the front four and dropping in zone coverage in the back seven , handing the Sooners their first loss of the season . <p> LSU 's defensive front is playing better than any in the nation , but that does n't mean the Tigers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't change philosophies for the last game of the season , even though White is more dangerous throwing against man coverage . But as Lavalais says , " You ca n't throw if you 're on your back . " <p> Sit down and talk with Saban . His tone is purposeful and convincing . He 's genuine . You get the feeling it would take him all of 15 minutes to convince the residents of Anchorage that it 's really only chilly in January . This helps explain LSU 's nationally ranked recruiting classes the last three years and how the talent level has increased significantly since the last of Gerry DiNardo 's five seasons in Baton Rouge in 1999 . <p> Justin Vincent is proof that the Tigers ' talent no longer runs puddle deep . Earlier this season , starting running backs Joseph Addai and Shyrone Carey were sidelined by injuries . Saban looked to Vincent , a freshman , who played so well that he won the starting job and ended the regular season by running for 201 yards against Georgia and being named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The best way to neutralize Oklahoma 's speed on defense is to use draws and traps and counter plays , staples of LSU 's I-formation offense . Once the defense is forced to slow down to prevent overpursuing plays , the Tigers ' size with the middle three of center Ben Wilkerson and guards Stephen Peterman and Nate Livings should wear down OU 's undersized but quick and athletic front four . <p> Once LSU can run with success , the Sooners should become susceptible to play-action passing , and Mauck wo n't be forced to sit in the shotgun and avoid various zone blitzes . <p> " If ( LSU ) is in the shotgun early , " says one SEC defensive coordinator , " that means they ca n't run the ball and have no confidence in their running game . Then they 've got no chance . " <p> It was n't so long ago that Mauck was taking bus trips to South Bend , Fort Wayne and Cedar Rapids , trying to hit a curveball in front of a couple hundred fans . Now he 's setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the history of LSU football . That 's some chance for a guy who just wants to get through dental school . " It 's very important to me , " Mauck says . " But right now , there 's something a little more important . " <p> And it has nothing to do with models or Heisman Trophies . Everything really is n't how it seems . The word on LSU <p> " Production-wise , they 're neck-and-neck with Oklahoma . " <p> - Mike Shula , Alabama coach , whose team lost by 24 points to the Tigers and by seven to the Sooners <p> " We are n't exactly a bunch of slouches , and they 've stuck it to us . " <p> - Sean Jones , Georgia safety <p> " They are as good as anyone in the country in my mind . Definitely the best defense we 've seen this year . " <p> - David Cutcliffe , Mississippi coach <p> " There 's no question that 's the best defense I have faced and best defense I will face . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the SEC title game <p> " There is no doubt we are the best defense in the country . " <p> - Will Muschamp , LSU defensive coordinator , to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution <p> " We 've got the athletes , we 've got the schemes , we 've got the coaching staff , and we execute . There 's no team out there that intimidates us . " <p> - Devery Henderson , LSU wide receiver <p> " Obviously , solving the problem of world hunger would be a little easier than trying to get enough tickets . " <p> - Skip Bertman , LSU athletic director , on staging a BCS Championship Game in the Bayou The word on Oklahoma <p> " This could be one of the best teams college football has ever seen . They are that good . " <p> - The Arizona Republic , following the Sooners ' 65-13 spanking of Texas <p> " They 're the best team in college football - so we are told . " <p> - Le Miles , Oklahoma State coach , before his team got walloped , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered as one of the greatest teams ever . " <p> - Jonathan Jackson , Oklahoma defensive end , the mornging before the Big 12 title game <p> " You lose one game , and it 's a bad game to lose , but we 're still a good team and still deserve a chance . " <p> - Wayne Chambers , linebacker , the morning after the Big 12 title game <p> " No doubt about it , the Sooners backed into New Orleans . The OU team bus ought to have to drive down Bourbon Street in reverse . " <p> - The Daily Oklahoman <p> " We 're the only two ( contending ) teams in the country that had to play a 13th game . We had to do a little bit more to earn the right . " <p> - Nick Saban , LSU coach <p> " If a team can not win their conference , they should not be playing for the national title .
