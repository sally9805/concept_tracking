QUIVER TREE This striking giant aloe was given its name by the San people of southern Africa , who use the tree 's hollow branches as quivers for their arrows . Scientists have discovered that quiver trees are starting to die off in parts of their traditional range . The species might be in the early stages of moving southward , trying to escape rising temperatures closer to the equator . <P> PINON MOUSE This tiny resident of the southwestern U.S. has long eked out its living in juniper woodlands , but in California it is heading for higher , cooler altitudes in the High Sierra conifer forests . The mouse is one of several small mammals in the region that have moved their homes 1,000 to 3,000 ft. higher in elevation over the past century . <P> RED-BREASTED GOOSE Twenty-six bird species , including this goose , which breeds in the Arctic , are listed by the World Conservation Union as threatened by global warming . Half are seabirds whose food supplies are diminished because of climate changes . The rest are terrestrial species , including several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ levels . <P> AFRICAN ELEPHANT Global warming might not only shrink the elephant 's range within Africa but may also wreak havoc with the animal 's love life . The relative abundance  --  or scarcity  --  of food affects the social hierarchy of the herd , which in turn can determine which animals get to breed . <P> BUTTERFLIES Researchers have documented shifts in the ranges of many butterflies . One study looked at 35 species of nonmigratory butterflies whose ranges extended from northern Africa to northern Europe . The scientists found that two-thirds of the species had shifted their home ranges northward by 20 to 150 miles . In the U.S. , researchers have closely tracked the movements of the butterfly known as Edith 's checkerspot ( at right , middle ) . Though butterflies might be sturdier than they look , scientists believe many species will not survive the impact of climate change . <P> KING PROTEA It is the national flower of South Africa , just one among the many spectacular members of the large family of flowering plants named after Proteus , a Greek god capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than a third of all Proteaceae species could disappear by 2050 . <P> MISTLETOE The limber pine dwarf mistletoe is proliferating throughout western forests in North America , thanks to heat and drought-weakened trees that act as perfect hosts for this botanical parasite . It 's not unlike what happens in your body , says researcher Connie Millar of the U.S. Forest Service : " When your system is stressed , you 're more vulnerable to all kinds of things that want to get you .
