PETER ROBINSON <P> INSPECTOR ALAN BANKS <P> England 's Yorkshire dales have their bleak moods , but they 're not nearly as haunted as those that drive the melancholy head of the Eastvale murder squad . In his 15th procedural , Strange Affair , Banks must plumb his own brooding depths to unravel the disappearance of his brother . The crimes in this series can be grisly , but pleasure comes from watching the nuances of Banks ' character rise to the surface . <P> DONNA LEON <P> COMMISSARIO GUIDO BRUNETTI <P> No one knows the labyrinthine world of Venice or the way favoritism and corruption shape Italian life like Leon 's Brunetti . Blood from a Stone is not her best plot , but fortunately all 13 other Brunettis are now in paperback for those who have not yet met the thoughtful Venetian cop with a love of food , an outspoken wife and a computer-hacker secretary who plays man Friday to his detective . <P> JOHN LAWTON <P> INSPECTOR TROY <P> London under siege in World War II is Lawton 's prime subject , brilliantly evoked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sets off in pursuit of a cop killer in 1959 . In Flesh Wounds , you can feel the gritty pain of a city that has barely begun to rebuild from the ruins of the blitz , as Troy finds his trail winding backward to bloody events in the grim winter of 1941 . <P> LINDSEY DAVIS <P> MARCUS DIDIUS FALCO , P.I . <P> Yep , even ancient Rome had its shamuses . Falco wisecracks his way through the empire 's sleazy underside to provide amusing lessons on the way crime , greed and cover-ups were endemic even in 70 B.C. In the 17th Falco novel , See Delphi and Die , the Eternal City 's original tough guy takes on the tourist industry . ( Rome invented that too . ) Davis ' crimes are wickedly convoluted , but Falco 's facetious tongue and domestic complications are the real fun . <P> PHILIP KERR <P> WORLD WAR II THRILLERS <P> Nazi Germany is Kerr 's protagonist in four gripping tales . The latest , Hitler 's Peace , is a cunning what-if riff on the little-remembered 1943 Big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , it 's actually thrilling . And it will make you rush to read Berlin Noir ( out in paper ) , a masterly trio of mysteries starring ex-cop Bernie Gunther as he struggles with notions of justice in 1930 's Germany , soaked in the seamy authenticity of Hitler 's world . <P> JACQUELINE WINSPEAR <P> MAISIE DOBBS , INVESTIGATOR <P> Female detectives are usually tough ( Sara Paretsky 's V.I . Warshawski ) or cute ( Alexander McCall Smith 's Precious Ramotswe ) . Maisie , whose card reads PSYCHOLOGIST AND INVESTIGATOR , is neither : she 's a cerebral , vulnerable inquisitor who takes up sleuthing in the late 1930s to heal the trauma she experienced as a nurse in the Great War . Set in an era when women were grappling with modernity , Pardonable Lies , the third of this young series , sends Maisie on a quest for truth , during which secrets and lies lead instead to self-discovery.  --  By Johanna McGeary
