<p> Leave global diplomacy to the pros <p> Editor  --  So Sean Penn thinks because he has acted in and directed movies , he is qualified to lecture President Bush on American foreign policy . <p> He obviously has the same right to express his views as anyone else , but because he is a celebrity , he has media access the rest of us do not . His views on American military policy are no more valuable or informed than the average Joe working hard to put food on the table . We all have opinions ; Penn and his ilk have the money , name recognition and media contacts to shoot their mouths off to the rest of us . <p> So , to Sean , Alec , Tim , Susan , Wood , Whoopie , Barbra , Robert and all you other Hollywood yahoos who think you have something special to impart to the rest of us : Stick with what you do well . <p> CAROL BENSON <p> Modesto <p> SERIOUS PURPOSE <p> Editor  --  Matier and Ross miss the point ( " Willie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their column on the recent trip to Cuba by California business and political leaders . <p> The objectives of the trip ( which I participated in ) were to build goodwill and bridges for future investment opportunities , which are bound to open up once the United States ends its outdated economic embargo and joins the rest of the post-Cold War world . But it was about more than just plans for the future . A deal was struck to sell California wine in Cuba , and another deal to sell cheese is pending since agricultural products are exempt from the U.S. embargo . <p> Actually , California 's wine-and-cheese diplomacy is a belated response to initiatives by Midwest agribusiness , which has been all over the island during the last couple of years . Should California , the world 's fifth-largest economy , just sit on the sidelines ? <p> Looking to the future , the most important interest is probably architecture , design and development . Havana , the Paris of the Caribbean , is deteriorating faster than current investment can restore its handsome crumbling buildings . Foundations for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city , a true international treasure , were laid during this trip . <p> JOHN A. LOOMIS <p> Stanford <p> DOUBLE STANDARD <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle editorial ( " Why Lott Must Go , " Dec. 13 ) demonstrates that Republicans are up against a double standard on matters of race . <p> Where was The Chronicle editorial writers ' outrage last year when Democratic Sen. Robert Byrd , a former member of the Ku Klux Klan and former Democratic Senate leader , used the racial slur " white niggers " in a television interview ? Byrd is the only senator of either party to vote against both African American nominees to the Supreme Court . <p> Notwithstanding this double standard , Republicans must be unambiguous on the matter of race . Over time , Americans increasingly see racial segregation as a very deep stain on our country 's history . Sen. Trent Lott 's comments were insulting and wrong and his initial apologies inadequate . <p> Republicans must reconnect to our party 's core values and proud legacy . We are the Grand Old Party of our founder , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of President Dwight Eisenhower , who in September 1957 enforced a Supreme Court decision for school integration by sending federal troops to Little Rock , Ark. , after Democrat segregationist Gov . Orval Faubus ordered the Arkansas National Guard to bar black students from Central High School . <p> It was the Republican Senate leader , Everett McKinley Dirksen , who made it possible to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965 . These seminal laws were passed in spite of the filibustering opposition of Southern Democrats , including Sen. Albert Gore Sr. <p> Senate Republicans should reflect on that legacy when meeting in conference to choose their leadership next month . Sen. Lott must also search his own conscience . Americans have a right to expect a Senate leader who is absolutely clear on the subject of racial equality . <p> JIM HARTMAN <p> Berkeley <p> FORGIVE TRENT LOTT <p> Editor  --  Trent Lott has been a racist all of his life . However , he has apologized and asked for forgiveness . We should accept his apology and forgive him . Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , need to remember that Jesus , our leader , taught us to forgive . I can forgive Lott and still hope that he loses his post as majority leader of the Senate . He has a lot of repenting to do . <p> ROBERT WARREN CROMEY <p> San Francisco <p> POWER AND ARROGANCE <p> Editor  --  Bill Clinton messing with Monica Lewinsky , Tom Bates trashing the Daily Californian , Trent Lott showing his racist side  --  they knew what they were doing but because of the arrogance and power of their positions they ignored the consequences , leaving their supporters embarrassed , angry and disappointed . <p> PETER RUGH <p> Berkeley <p> CARY STAYNER 'S STORY <p> Editor  --  The Dec. 15 article on convicted Yosemite killer Cary Stayner left me feeling uneasy . This was understandable , I guess , given Stayner 's emotionless recounting of how he coldly murdered four people . <p> But I was further troubled by the article 's unavoidable message that I should reserve some sympathy for the killer . Forgive me , but I have a difficult time considering Stayner a fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own words ) " went back . . . and cut ( the victim 's ) head off . " <p> I hope the true victims ' families did n't have to read that article . <p> JOHN MINTON <p> Brisbane <p> GLORIFYING GUILT <p> When " glorifying the guilty " ( the Cary Stayner story ) receives more coverage than the plight of the murdered , we 're witnessing a society in decay . <p> PETE SENNHAUSER <p> San Mateo <p> BAD IN BERKELEY <p> Editor  --  Debra J. Saunders ( " Berserkley or psycho ? " Dec. 15 ) is right on target on two counts . First , by stealing newspapers that endorsed his opponent , Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates criminally dishonored the First Amendment . Second , and perhaps even more important , Saunders exposes the hypocrisy of the lefties and " progressives " who tried to minimize this whole affair . <p> As Saunders points out , this same Berkeley free-speech crowd is the first to rail about " silencing dissent , " unless , of course , it is their guy doing the silencing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco Chronicle . Although your editorial board ( Dec. 9 ) paid lip service to criticizing Bates , ultimately you termed it a " juvenile stunt . " <p> SCOTT ABRAMSON <p> San Mateo <p> ORNERY IN OAKLAND <p> Editor  --  Monday 's story about the city of Oakland passing a resolution to resist the USA Patriot Act enforcement has me worried . <p> It is in the Constitution to allow stringent , yet temporary , suspension of everyone 's " civil rights "  --  if needed  --  during emergency situations in order to preserve our way of life . <p> Our enemy is taking advantage of our so-called freedoms and civil rights , and using them to their advantage to attack us . If this were still World War II , I wonder if our local cities would have objected to the " discrimination " of German Nazis within our borders ? <p> Oakland and 18 other cities are creating " safe havens , " to which our enemies will flock , to remain as free as possible , for as long as possible . <p> With governments like that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies abroad . Our divided house will bring this nation to its knees . <p> DANIEL J. LORAN <p> San Francisco <p> JUST ASKING . . . <p> Editor  --  Does n't it bother anyone in the White House that the " intelligence reports " they rely on to start a war ( but refuse to show anyone ) come from the same people who failed to warn us of 9/11 ? <p> CHARLES KELLY <p> Fairfax
