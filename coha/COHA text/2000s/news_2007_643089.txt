<p> The principal of New York City 's first public school dedicated to the study of Arabic language and culture resigned under pressure yesterday , days after she was quoted defending the use of the word " intifada " as a T-shirt slogan . <p> Debbie Almontaser , a veteran public school teacher , stepped down as the principal of Khalil Gibran International Academy , a middle school that is to open this fall in Brooklyn . <p> " This morning I tendered my resignation to Chancellor Klein , which he accepted , " she said in a statement , referring to Schools Chancellor Joel I. Klein . " I became convinced yesterday that this week 's headlines were endangering the viability of Khalil Gibran International Academy , even though I apologized . " <p> Those headlines had become impossible for Ms. Almontaser and the Department of Education to ignore . On Wednesday , a headline in The New York Post called Ms. Almontaser the " Intifada Principal . " Yesterday , an editorial in the paper had the headline , " What 's Arabic for ' Shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his weekly radio call-in program , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he continued to support the school , but welcomed Ms. Almontaser 's departure . <p> " She got a question , she 's not all that media-savvy maybe , and she tried to explain a word rather than just condemn , " he said . " But I think she felt that she had become the focus of  --  rather than having the school the focus  --  so today she submitted her resignation , which is nice of her to do . I appreciate all her service , and I think she 's right to do so . " <p> Chancellor Klein , who is vacationing in Colorado , acknowledged that Ms. Almontaser 's resignation was in the best interests of the school , said David Cantor , a spokesman for the department . <p> Ms. Almontaser 's resignation was the latest setback for a school that has been bombarded with criticism since February , when the city announced plans to open it . The attacks came from parents at public schools that were to share their space with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnists , who said the school could promote radical Islam . <p> But the Education Department said yesterday that it was still committed to opening the school and was searching for a new principal . Ms. Almontaser is expected to be assigned to another position within the department . <p> Ms. Almontaser 's remarks , made last weekend , were in response to questions from The Post over the phrase " Intifada NYC , " which was printed on T-shirts sold by Arab Women Active in the Arts and Media , a Brooklyn-based organization . The shirts have no relation to her school . <p> " The word basically means ' shaking off , ' " Ms. Almontaser told the paper . " That is the root word if you look it up in Arabic . " <p> With the help of the Education Department 's press office , she apologized on Monday , saying she regretted her remarks . " By minimizing the word 's historical associations , I implied that I condone violence and threats of violence , " she said in the statement . The word has come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Education officials tried to tamp down the situation , saying Ms. Almontaser had no direct connection to the Brooklyn group . <p> Her apology was followed by a rebuke on Wednesday from Randi Weingarten , the president of the United Federation of Teachers . Ms. Weingarten , who had previously defended the school , called the word " intifada " " something that ought to be denounced , not explained away . " <p> And education officials said that after Ms. Weingarten 's statements , Ms. Almontaser had become an untenable distraction , and that the school would be better served with a new principal . <p> Yesterday morning , speaking on his weekly radio call-in program , Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said he continued to support the school , but welcomed Ms. Almontaser 's departure . In an interview yesterday , Ms. Weingarten said she respected Ms. Almontaser for resigning . " She was becoming a lightning rod , " she said . " Instead of debunking the misapprehensions about the school , all she did was confirm them . " <p> Ms. Almontaser had a major hand in designing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partnership with New Visions for Public Schools , a nonprofit group that has helped create many of the city 's new small schools . As described by its planners , the school will offer a standard college preparatory curriculum , with instruction in Arabic each day and a focus on international studies . Five teachers have been hired so far . <p> The Education Department had planned for roughly half of the enrolled students to have some background in Arabic , and the other half to be a mixture of students from diverse racial and ethnic backgrounds . <p> So far , the enrollment stands at 44 , with most students identifying themselves as black , and six Arabic speakers . The school planned to have only sixth graders this year , then expand by a grade a year until it includes grades 6 to 12 . <p> Its first proposed location was in the building that houses Public School 282 , an elementary school in Park Slope , Brooklyn . But parents there mounted vigorous opposition , saying there was insufficient room for the two schools to share space . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another site , in Boerum Hill , Brooklyn . This time , Khalil Gibran would share space with two schools : the Math and Science Exploratory School , a middle school , and the Brooklyn High School of the Arts . <p> But parents there were just as antagonistic to sharing space with Khalil Gibran , protesting at a contentious public hearing in the school auditorium in May . The Education Department insisted that the school would open as planned , though . <p> The department 's decision was supported by many community leaders who had worked with Ms. Almontaser , who has been active for many years in community and interfaith outreach . She immigrated from Yemen when she was 3 and is fluent in Arabic . <p> In an interview in May , Ms. Almontaser said she was unprepared for the criticism she encountered from commentators . " What I am surprised about , really , is how stuff like this is actually permitted and allowed in public forums , " she said . <p> Despite the department 's efforts earlier in the week to defuse the situation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Almontaser on the record . Yesterday morning , Mr. Bloomberg issued his own version of a defense on his radio show . " She 's very smart , " he said . " She 's certainly not a terrorist . She really does care . " ##
