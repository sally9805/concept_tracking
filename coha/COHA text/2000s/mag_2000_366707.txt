Titus ( debuts march 20 , 8:30 p.m . E.T. , Fox ) may have the most jarring laugh track in TV history . In the pilot alone , Christopher Titus ( as himself ) gets decked by his drunken dad Ken , announces that his mom is clinically insane , and lurks outside a room that just may contain pop 's corpse  --  all to the same sort of yuks as when the sassy blind guy gets off a zinger on Becker . <P> Making audiences feel weird merely for laughing is a sign of something quite wrong , or quite right ; here it 's mostly the latter . Titus is based on Titus ' one-man show Norman Rockwell Is Bleeding , and like many stand-ups turned TV stars , he 's a limited actor . But the buff , brush-cut Titus has more to offer than affable **30;11087;TOOLONG jokes ; his every sarcasm and tic betrays an intense , coiled anger . The pilot  --  in which he and his brother confront their father 's possible suicide ( Dad 's been in his room four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hilarious and audacious set piece . ( Which makes later episodes ' juvenile sex-'n ' - insult humor all the more regrettable . ) Ken , played by a gruff but sympathetic Stacy Keach , proves more than a mere excuse for Titus ' screw-ups . " My father never missed a drink or a joint or a party or a chance to get laid in his life , " Titus concedes . " But he also never missed a day of work or a house payment . " <P> Above all , Titus subverts TV 's definition of dysfunction : quirky two-parent home with a zany 10-year-old . Ironically , it comes as networks are racing to create new feel-good family sitcoms . Surely there 's also room for one good feel-queasy family comedy . <P>  --  By James Poniewozik
