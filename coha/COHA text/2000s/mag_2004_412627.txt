" ... The tenets of environmentalism are all about belief . It is about whether you are going to be a sinner or saved , one of the people on the side of salvation or on the side of doom , one of us or one of them . " // THE GREATEST CHALLENGE facing mankind is to distinguish reality from fantasy , truth from propaganda . Perceiving the truth always has been a dilemma , but in the Information Age-or , as I think of it , the Disinformation Age-it takes on a special urgency and importance . We must decide daily whether the threats we face are real or not , and whether the solutions we are offered will do any good . Every one of us has a sense of the world , and we all know that this sense is in part supplied by the people around us and the society we live in ; in pail generated by our own emotional state , which we project outward ; and in part results from actual perceptions of the world . In short , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide which of our perceptions are genuine and which are false . As an example of this challenge to mankind , I want to talk about environmentalism . In order not to be misunderstood , I need to be perfectly clear that I believe it is incumbent on us to live our lives in a way that takes into account all the consequences of our actions , including those to other people and the environment . I believe it is important to act in ways that are sympathetic to the biosphere . I feel the world has genuine difficulties and that they can and should be improved . Yet , I also think that deciding what constitutes responsible action is immensely complicated , and the results of our deeds very often are hard to know in advance . I suppose our past record of environmental action is discouraging , to put it mildly , because even our best intended efforts often have gone awry . Moreover , we do not recognize our previous failures or face them squarely-and I think I know why . While studying anthropology in college , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ structures always resurface . They can not be eliminated . One of those is religion . It is said we live in a secular society in which many people-the best and most enlightened-do not believe in any creed . However , you can not eliminate religion from the psyche of mankind . If you suppress it in one form , it merely reemerges in another . You may not believe in God , but you still have to believe in something that gives meaning to your life and shapes your sense of the world . Such a belief is religious . Today , one of the most powerful religions in the Western World is environmentalism . It seems to be the faith of choice for urban atheists . Why do I say it is a religion ? Well , just look carefully at the beliefs . What you see is a perfect 21st-century mapping of traditional Judeo-Christian dogma and myths . For example , there is an initial Eden , a Paradise , a state of innocence and unity in nature ; there is a fall from grace into a state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of knowledge , and , as a result of our actions , there is a judgment day coming . We all are energy sinners , doomed to die , unless we seek deliverance , which now is called sustainability . Sustainability is salvation in the church of the environment , just as organic food is its Communion . Eden , the fall of man , the loss of grace , the coming doomsday-these are deeply held mythic structures . They are profoundly conservative concepts . They even may be hardwired in the brain . I certainly do not wish to talk anyone out of them , just as I have no desire to dissuade anybody out of a belief that Jesus Christ is the Son of God who rose from the dead . The reason that I have no wish to debate these convictions is that I know that I can not . These are not facts that can be argued ; these are issues of faith . // So it is , sadly , with environmentalism . Increasingly , it seems , facts are not necessary , because the tenets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether you are going to be a sinner or saved , one of the people on the side of salvation or on the side of doom , one of us or one of them . Am I exaggerating to make a point ? I am afraid not . Because we understand a lot more about the world than we did 40 or 50 years ago , our new knowledge base is not really supportive of certain core environmental myths , yet they refuse to die . Let us examine some of those notions . There is no Eden . There never was . When was that Garden of the wonderful mythic past ? Was it the time when infant mortality was 80% , when four children in five died of disease before the age of five ? Was it a time when one woman in six died in childbirth ; when the average lifespan was 40 , as it was in the U.S. a century ago ; when plagues swept across the planet , killing millions in a stroke ; when millions more starved to death ? Was that Paradise ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony in an Eden-like environment ? Well , they never did . On this continent , the newly arrived travelers who crossed the land bridge from Asia almost immediately set about wiping out hundreds of species of large animals , and they did this several thousand years before the white man showed up to accelerate the process . What was the condition of life ? Loving , peaceful , harmonious ? Hardly . The people of the New World lived in a state of constant warfare-generations of hatred and perpetual battles . The warlike tribes of this continent are famous even today : the Comanche , Sioux , Apache , Mohawk , Aztec , Toltec , Inca . Some of them practiced infanticide and human sacrifice . Those clans that were not fiercely warlike were exterminated or learned to build their villages high in the cliffs to attain some measure of safety . How about the human condition in the rest of the world ? The Maori of New Zealand committed massacres regularly . The Dyaks of Borneo were headhunters . The Polynesians , living in surroundings as close to Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a society so hideously restrictive that you could lose your life for stepping in the footprint of a chief . It was the Polynesians who gave us the very concept of taboo , as well as the word itself . The noble savage is a fantasy . That anyone still believes it , 200 years after philosopher Jean Jacques Rousseau , shows the tenacity of religious myths and their ability to hang on in the face of centuries of factual contradiction . There even was an academic movement , during the latter 20th century , that claimed that cannibalism was a white man 's invention to demonize indigenous races . ( Only academics could fight such a battle . ) It was some 30 years before professors finally agreed that yes , the ritualistic consumption of human flesh indeed does occur . Meanwhile , all during this time , New Guinea highlanders continued to eat the brains of their enemies , until they finally were made to understand that they risked kuru , a fatal neurological disease . Remember , too , that the African Pygmies have one of the highest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tasaday of the Philippines turned out to be a publicity stunt , a nonexistent entity . In short , the romantic view of the natural world as a blissful Eden is only held by people who have no actual experience of nature . Those who do are not romantic about it . They may hold spiritual beliefs about the world around them ; they may have a sense of the unity of nature or the aliveness of all living things , but they still kill animals and uproot plants in order to eat and to survive . If they do not , they will die . If you put yourself in nature , if only for a matter of days , you quickly will be disabused of all your romantic fantasies . Take a trek through the jungles of Borneo , and in short order you will have festering sores on your skin and bugs all over your body , biting in your hair and crawling up your nose and into your ears . You will have infections and sickness , and if you are not with somebody who knows what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starve to death . Chances are that even in the jungles of Borneo you will not experience nature so directly since you will have covered your entire body with DEET . The truth is , almost nobody wants to experience real nature . What people desire is to spend a week or two in a cabin in the woods , with screens on the windows . They want a simplified life for a while , a nice river rafting trip for a few days , with somebody else doing the cooking . Nobody wants to go back to nature in any real sense , and no one does . It is all talk , and as the years go on and the world population grows increasingly urban , it is uninformed talk . Farmers know of what they speak ; city people do not . They just have their fantasies . One way to measure the prevalence of fantasy is to note the number of people who die because they have not the least knowledge of how nature truly is . They stand beside wild animals , like buffalo , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dicey weather , without the proper gear , and freeze to death . They drown in the surf on their holiday because they can not conceive the real power of what we blithely call " the force of nature . " They have seen the ocean , but they never have been in it . The television generation expects nature to act the way they picture it . They think all life experiences can be TiVo-ed . The notion that the natural world obeys its own rules and does not give a damn about their expectations comes as a massive shock . Well-to-do , educated individuals in an urban environment experience the ability to fashion their daily lives as they wish . They buy clothes that suit their taste and decorate their apartments as they like . Within limits , they can contrive a daily urban world that pleases them . The natural world is not so malleable , however . On the contrary , it will demand that you adapt to it-and if you do not , you will die . It is a harsh , powerful , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many years ago , I was trekking in the Karakoram Mountains of northern Pakistan , when my group came to a freezing cold , glacial river , which was running very fast , although it was not deep-maybe two-and-a-half or three feet . Nevertheless , my guide set out ropes for people to hold as they crossed , and everybody proceeded , one at a time , with extreme care . I asked the guide what was the big deal about crossing a three-foot-deep river ? " Well , " he replied , " supposing you fell and suffered a compound fracture . " We were four days trek from the last big town , where there was a radio . Even if the guide went back double-time to get help , it still would be at least three days before he could return with a helicopter , if one were available . In that time , I probably would be dead from my injuries . Now , let us return to religion . If Eden is a fantasy that never existed , and mankind was never noble , kind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , what about the rest of the religious tenets ? What about salvation , sustainability , and judgment day ? What about the coming environmental doom from fossil fuels and global warming if we all do not get down on our knees and conserve every day ? Yet , something has been left off the doomsday list lately . Although the preachers of conservatism have been yelling about population for 50 years , over the last decade , world population seems to have taken an unexpected turn . Fertility rates are falling almost everywhere . As a result , over the course of my lifetime , the thoughtful predictions for total world population have gone from a high of 20,000,000,000 to 15,000,000,00 to 11,000,000,000-which was the United Nations estimate around 1990-to 9,000,000,000 today and , soon , perhaps less . There are some individuals who now think that world population will peak in 2050 , and , that by 2100 , there will be fewer people than there are today . Is this a reason to rejoice , to say hallelujah ? Certainly not . Without a pause , we hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population , or the impending predicament of an aging population . Nobody anywhere will say that the core fears expressed for most of my life have turned out to be false . As we have moved into the future , these doomsday visions vanished , like a mirage in the desert . They never were there , although they still appear on the horizon , as mirages do . Okay , so the preachers made a mistake . They got one prediction wrong ; they are human . So what ? Only it is not just one prediction ; it is a whole slew of them . We are running out of oil . We are running out of global resources . Famed biologist Paul Ehrlich projected that 60,000,000 Americans would die of starvation in the 1980s . Forty-thousand species become extinct every year . Half of all species on the planet will be extinct by the year 2000 . On and on and on it goes . With so many past failures , one might think that environmental predictions would become more cautious . Not if it is a religion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placard who predicts the end of the world does not quit when the world does not cease on the day he expects . He just changes his placard , sets a new doomsday date , and goes back to walking the streets . One of the defining features of religion is that beliefs are not troubled by facts , because they have nothing to do with them . I can list some facts for you . I know you have not read any of these in the newspaper , because newspapers do not report them . I can tell you that DDT is not a carcinogen , did not cause birds to die , and never should have been banned . The people who outlawed it knew that it was not toxic and halted its use anyway . The DDT ban has caused the loss of tens of millions of people , mostly children , whose deaths are directly attributable to a callous , technologically advanced Western society that promoted the new cause of environmentalism by pushing a fantasy about a pesticide , and thus irrevocably harmed the Third World . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 20th-century history of America . Secondhand smoke is not a health hazard to anyone and never was , and the Environmental Protection Agency always has known this . The evidence for global warming is far weaker than its proponents ever would admit . The percentage of U.S. land area that is taken up by urbanization , including cities and roads , is five percent . The Sahara desert is shrinking , and the ice in Antarctica is increasing . A blue-ribbon panel in Science magazine concluded that there is no known technology that will enable us to halt the rise of carbon dioxide in the 21st century-not wind , solar , or even nuclear power . A totally new technology-like nuclear fusion-is necessary , otherwise nothing can be done . In the meantime , all efforts are a waste of time . That was reported when the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that alternative technologies existed that could control greenhouse gases . I can , with a great deal of time , give you the factual basis for these views and cite the appropriate sources . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journals currently in print . Yet , such references probably would not impact more than a handful , because the convictions of a religion are not dependent on facts , but rather are matters of unshakable faith . Most of us have had the experience of interacting with religious fundamentalists , and we understand that one of the problems is that they have no perspective on themselves . They never recognize that their way of thinking is just one of many other possible alternatives which may be equally useful or good . On the contrary , they believe their way is the only course , and everyone else is wrong . They are in the business of salvation , and they want to help you to see things in the right way . They want to help you be saved . They are inherently rigid and completely uninterested in opposing points of view . I want to argue that now is the time for us to make a major shift in our thinking about the planet , similar to that which occurred around the first Earth Day in 1970 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , we need to get environmentalism out of the sphere of religion . We have to stop the mythic fantasies and halt the doomsday predictions . We need to start doing hard science instead . There are two reasons we must get rid of the religion of environmentalism . First , we need an environmental movement , and such a movement is not very effective if it is conducted as a religion . We know from history that faith tends to kill people , and environmentalism already has decimated somewhere between 10,000,000 to 30,000,000 people since the 1970s . That is not a good record . Environmentalism needs to be rational , flexible , and based in objective and verifiable science . Moreover , it must be apolitical . To mix natural concerns with the frantic fantasies that people have about one political party or another is to miss the truth-that there is very little difference between the parties on this subject , except for pandering rhetoric . The effort to promote effective legislation is not helped by thinking that the Democrats will save us and the Republicans will not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget which president started the EPA : archconservative Richard Nixon , a staunch Republican . Also keep in mind which president sold the Federal oil leases , that allowed drilling in Santa Barbara , Calif. : Great Society architect Lyndon Johnson , a prototypical Democrat . So , get politics out of your thinking about the environment . The second reason to abandon environmental religion is more pressing . Fundamentalists think they know it all , but the unhappy truth of Planet Earth is that we are dealing with incredibly complex , evolving systems , and we usually are not certain how best to proceed . Those who are certain are demonstrating their personality type , or their belief system , not the state of their knowledge . Our record in the past-for example , in managing national parks-is humiliating . Our 50-year effort at forest fire suppression is a well-intentioned disaster from which our forests may never recover . We should be humble , deeply humble , in the face of what we are trying to accomplish . We should be trying various methods , open-minded about assessing the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does none of these things . How will we manage to get environmentalism out of the clutches of religion and back to a scientific discipline ? The answer is simple : We have to institute a far more stringent set of requirements for what constitutes knowledge in the environmental realm . I am thoroughly sick of politicized so-called facts that simply are not true . It is not that these " facts " are exaggerations of an underlying truth . Nor is it that certain organizations are spinning their case to present it in the strongest possible way . Not at all . What more and more groups are doing is putting out blatant lies ; falsehoods that they know to be false . This trend began with the DDT campaign , and it persists to this day . At the moment , the EPA is hopelessly politicized . It probably is best to shut it down and start over . What we need is something much closer to the Food and Drug Administration , an organization that will be ruthless about acquiring verifiable results , fund identical research projects to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field agree to honest standards . In the end , science offers us the only way out of politics . If we allow science to become politicized , we are lost . We will enter the Internet version of the Dark Ages , an era of shifting fears and wild prejudices , transmitted to people who do not know any better . That is not a good future for the human race . That is our past . So it is time to abandon the religion of environmentalism and return to the science of environmentalism , and base our public policy decisions firmly on that .
