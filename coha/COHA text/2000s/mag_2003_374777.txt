Visit National Public Radio at its headquarters in Washington , and you might think you have accidentally wandered into a corporate headquarters . The network , which once operated out of a cramped basement , today fills a sleek seven-story building with a lobby curved like a radio wave . Its studios feature the latest digital sound gear . Executives , if prodded , talk about " branding , " " revenue growth " and " audience fragmentation . " They speak such words softly  --  NPR is , after all , a not-for-profit organization whose member stations constantly beg listeners for contributions . But it 's getting harder to keep its success a hush-hush affair . <P> After nearly going bankrupt in the mid-1980s , NPR is enjoying its best stretch ever , with a weekly audience up 48% since 1998 and revenues , in a flat economy , projected to grow 5% this year . As war and terrorism jitters create a hunger for more in-depth news  --  with little of it to be found on many commercial stations  --  listeners are turning to NPR programs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americans tune in at least once a week  --  an audience boost of 16% since the Sept. 11 attacks of 2001 . Listeners are also attracted by a fresh burst of creativity among producers of public-radio programs , thanks in part to a spirited rivalry between NPR and Public Radio International ( PRI ) , a network based in Minneapolis , Minn . <P> Belying its reputed distaste for crass commerce , NPR has become quite entrepreneurial  --  in a once cozy environment that has turned surprisingly competitive . NPR does n't own any radio stations . It is an independent producer and distributor of shows , led by the venerable news programs Morning Edition and All Things Considered . More than 700 of the 908 public-radio stations in the U.S. pay annual NPR membership dues of $7,845 , plus " carriage fees , " which run as high as $1.3 million a year , to broadcast NPR programs . But in contrast to common practice in commercial radio and TV , public-radio stations do n't have to affiliate exclusively with one network . Most also pay carriage fees to PRI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slice-of-life feature show , and Studio 360 , starring culture critic Kurt Andersen . PRI also distributes most of the shows produced by Minnesota Public Radio , including Garrison Keillor 's A Prairie Home Companion . <P> Long the whipping boy of politicians who want to cut its subsidies , public radio has become less dependent on federal funds . The U.S. Corporation for Public Broadcasting will dole out $82.7 million to public radio this year , only about 15% of public radio 's spending . Most stations are also getting less money from the states , and some small stations are struggling .
