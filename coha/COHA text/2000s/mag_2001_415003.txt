// On October 18 , the nation 's most colorful governor , Jesse Ventura of Minnesota , took the podium at the Riverfront Radisson in St. Paul and announced a radical new program to reduce the state 's waste stream . For the next five years , he said , Sony Electronics had agreed to fund a program that will take back for recycling any and all outdated Sony products currently in the hands of state consumers . Though Minnesota has not , like Massachusetts , banned TV and computer cathode ray tubes ( CRTs ) from its landfills , Tony Hainault of the state Office of Environmental Assistance says there has long been sentiment there to get old electronics out of the waste stream . " CRTs are the largest source of lead in the municipal waste stream , " he says , " and printed circuit boards are the second . In a one-year program ending last year , Minnesota collected and recycled nearly 600 tons of used electronics . Sony 's program , which will spread to five other states in 2001 , is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such examples of Extended Producer Responsibility ( EPR ) are business-as-usual throughout Europe , where the concept of legislatively mandating manufacturers to take responsibility for the waste they create has taken firm root . For a determined group of environmentalists , Sony 's voluntary initiative was the first success of many in what they see as a developing national movement toward zero waste . The phrase is not to be taken literally , but as a goal that emphasizes source reduction ahead of managing waste . Recycling is America 's favorite environmental activity- 100 million of us do it every day-but while there have been dramatic successes in many areas , overall recycling rates have declined slightly . An impressive 53 percent of plastic soda bottles were recycled in 1994 , but only 35.6 percent in 1998 . So why are these environmentalists so confident ? Because , they believe , reducing the waste stream to a mere trickle is in everybody 's interests , even benefiting the very corporations that have been screaming the loudest about the burden of recycling . Sony 's president and chief operating officer , Fujio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Taking back and recycling products helps Sony design future devices that cost less to manufacture and help save our precious natural resources . It 's a win-win situation . " " Where should we aim after 2000 ? " asks Gary Liss , a California-based zero waste consultant . " Do we stop at 35 percent or 50 percent recycling and build landfills and incinerators to handle the rest of our waste ? Or do we continue to build on the tremendous success of the past decade and work to eliminate waste at the source ? " A Powerful Push As a concept , zero waste has come a long way in a very short time . Eric Lombardi , executive director of Boulder , Colorado 's very successful Eco-Cycle recycling program , says that the current U.S. movement grew out of heated board discussions in the early 1990s at the mainstream National Recycling Coalition ( which has corporate membership ) . " Half the group saw the value of the European EPR model and half did not , " Lombardi said . " We 'd say that corporations should use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd reply that it was n't economically feasible . Ultimately , we decided that coalitions are not a great place for getting anything done . " That experience led directly to the formation in 1996 of the GrassRoots Recycling Network ( GRRN ) as the U.S. advocate for zero waste . " We needed a group that would n't get bogged down , that was free to push the envelope , " Lombardi says . And pushing the envelope is exactly what GRRN does . The group 's national coordinator , Bill Sheehan , has led the network in a protracted and effective campaign directed at Coca-Cola , which made-and failed to keep-a 1990 promise to use 25 percent post-consumer waste in its plastic beverage bottles . While Coke has not capitulated , it has agreed to use 10 percent recycled content in a quarter of its bottles , making 2.5 percent total content . Further pressure on both Coke and Pepsi is coming from a group of socially responsible investors , including Walden Asset Management and the As You Sow Foundation . The shareholders filed a resolution in late November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ content in their bottles , but also to put their weight behind recycling programs to achieve an 80 percent recycling rate for their beverage containers ( two out of three of which are now landfilled ) . " Zero waste is about challenging the ruling paradigm that says we can manage waste safely in landfills and incinerators , " Sheehan says . " All the elements of a zero waste system are there , and it 's a question of bringing them together . We believe that some public officials will get the vision and start piecing it together . " One city that seems to be " getting it " is Seattle , which in 1998 adopted zero waste as a guiding principle in its solid waste plan . " This principle entails managing resources instead of waste , " the city said in a resolution , " conserving natural resources through waste prevention and recycling ; turning discarded resources into jobs and new products instead of trash ; promoting products and materials that are durable ; and discouraging products and materials that can only become trash after their use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goals , as has Carrboro , North Carolina . Photograph In 2001 , Sony will have programs operating in six states to retrieve and recycle any and all of its consumer electronics , including lead-heavy televisions and computer monitors . Photograph Recycling of beverage containers ( left ) is slipping , leading to calls for more statewide bottle bills . Reduced to a raw material , metal waste ( below ) has considerable reuse value . // There is growing conviction in solid waste circles that conventional recycling has gone about as far as it 's likely to go without fundamental , society-wide changes . " Communities like Seattle and Minneapolis have expended a lot of resources and hit a ceiling at around the 60 percent recycling rate , " says Sheehan . " Going beyond that is very difficult , and the primary barriers are the lack of manufacturer responsibility and the non-level playing field that subsidizes wasting . " In a report called " Welfare for Waste , " GRRN has documented 15 tax-and-spend subsidies that directly benefit three industries-forestry , petroleum and mining-whose products directly compete with recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to realize that public subsidies for virgin materials puts recycling at a competitive disadvantage , " says Sheehan . In 1996 , the President 's Council on Sustainable Development recommended that U.S. businesses adhere to what it called " extended product responsibility . " Priorities are considerably different in Europe , where extended producer responsibility is a given and in many cases , the law . The difference between the two concepts is large enough to drive many truckloads of waste through . The Clinton administration considers waste a shared responsibility between government , industry and consumers . In Europe , the onus is on the companies that produce it . In some ways , voluntary efforts like Sony 's in Minnesota are an effort to head off mandatory government programs like those in Europe . " The European programs wo n't necessarily be cost effective , " says Mark Small , Sony 's vice president of environment , health and safety . " We 're trying to get a program up and running that will make both environmental and business sense . " An internal Sony document , leaked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and " cripple " efforts to pass electronic recycling laws . When Germany adopted its Packaging Ordinance of 1991 , it was stepping off into uncharted territory . The law , says Bette Fishbein , senior fellow of the New York-based group INFORM Inc. , shifted " the costs of collecting , sorting and recycling used packaging from municipal government to private industry , " a revolutionary policy that " sent shock waves around the world that reverberate to this day . " Packaging waste accounted for about a third ( by weight ) and a half ( by volume ) of all the landfilled waste in Germany , and that 's why it was the first category to be addressed , although other planned initiatives are targeting electronics and vehicles . Germany 's landfill space crisis-a problem it shares with many other European countries-made such a radical solution not only necessary but politically palatable as well . The packaging law required deposits on packaging and take-back by retailers ( a system similar to the bottle bills in 10 U.S. states ) , but it gave manufacturers an important " out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Industry did , devising the Duales System Deutschland ( DSD ) , which adds a second bin for packaging waste to the German household . Packaging bearing the now-famous " Green Dot " logo is collected , sorted and recycled , with costs borne by the producers . In a 1998 report written for Pollution Prevention Review , Fishbein reports that during its first four years , the Green Dot program cut packaging consumption in Germany by a million tons . To avoid higher costs down the road , manufacturers lightened their packages , eliminated unnecessary packaging ( like boxes within boxes ) , and marketed their products in more concentrated forms . While it 's impossible to make a direct comparison , during the same period U.S. packaging increased by 13 percent . Despite its successes , the Green Dot program has been criticized by some environmentalists because it 's being run by the corporate sector , and by industry groups that claim it 's too expensive for the results achieved and unnecessary as well . The European Organization for Packaging and the Environment , a business trade group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of packaging waste " is , in fact , " a myth . " In the early years of the program , there 's no doubt that it recovered too much waste for Germany 's recycling infrastructure ; critics claimed that Green Dot was simply exporting the country 's problems . These complaints have since been resolved with a larger domestic recycling capacity . Green Dot spread to the 15 member states of the European Union in 1994 with the adoption of a less-stringent Packaging Directive , and various programs are starting up . In England , for instance , 4,500 businesses that each handle more than 50 tons of packaging per year have registered with environmental agencies . Variations of the Green Dot are in place all over the world , including programs in Poland , Hungary , Korea , Taiwan and Japan . In Finland , for instance , an EPR law has been in effect since 1997 , and for 2001 it aims to reuse or recycle 82 percent of packaging waste , and prevent another six percent from being created in the first place . In Argentina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't recyclable or reusable as " hazardous waste . " The world leader in mandating zero waste may well be New Zealand , which launched a national pilot project in 1999 to put major waste reduction into place on the level of the country 's local councils . Zero Waste New Zealand Trust received an overwhelming response . Designed for the participation of 10 councils , by mid-2000 the project had 25 , each funded with a $25,000 ( NZ ) grant . According to Warren Snow , a Trust trustee , significant waste reduction is already being recorded across the country . One district , Opotiki , has cut landfilling from 10,000 tons to 3,500 per year , and expects to recover 80 percent of municipal waste by November . In the second half of 2000 , six stores in Auckland achieved zero waste status and no longer have dumpsters on their premises . In one example , shoe buyers at The Warehouse are asking suppliers to stop stuffing shoes with paper , and that alone has reduced the store 's waste stream by 15 percent . " New Zealand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , " says Snow . " It was the first country in the world to give women the vote , the first country to have a national nuclear-free policy and is on the way to being a waste-free country . " Electronic and vehicle recycling is moving ahead elsewhere as well . In Holland , a law that went into effect in 1999 requires computers , appliances and other equipment to be taken back by their manufacturers . Italy has required refrigerator takeback since 1997 , and is working on regulations for other appliances . Norway 's program , adopted in 1999 , has very ambitious goals . Japan 's law , covering many electronic products , goes into effect this year . The European Union has also drafted legislation for endof-life vehicles ( ELVs ) , and sets an 80 percent recycling rate for 2005 . As Fishbein describes it , car owners would be required to obtain a " certificate of deregistration " confirming that their vehicle had been legally recycled . Anyone reading through that long list of international accomplishment will be struck by how far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon change , as considerable ingenuity is being applied to the colossal task of reducing America 's waste stream-by far the largest per capita in the world . The U.S. , with just five percent of the world 's population , uses 25 percent of its resources . In 1997 , Americans threw out 430 billion pounds of garbage , or 1,600 pounds for every man , woman and child . The GRRN report " Wasting and Recycling in the U.S. 2000 " indicates that between 1990 and 1997 plastic packaging grew five times faster by weight than plastic recovered for recycling . And according to Ecology of Commerce author Paul Hawken , 94 percent of the materials used in the manufacture of the average U.S. product are thrown away before the product even reaches the shelves . It 's plain that recycling alone ca n't hope to significantly shrink that mountain of trash . Brenda Platt of the Washington-based Institute for Local Self-Reliance says the key is to stop thinking about waste as a problem and to start thinking about it as an opportunity-in effect , from waste to wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the local level , " she says . " Some communities , like Seattle and San Jose , have achieved 65 percent reductions . " Photograph America 's solution to its gigantic waste problem has been to landfill it , wasting valuable resources and creating a mountain of trash . Photograph New Zealand has become a nation of can-do recyclers , with 25 local councils taking part in a Zero Waste New Zealand Trust pilot program . Corporations are also making dramatic waste-reduction gains . Photograph Berkeley , California 's Urban Ore is a model for the resource recovery park , a one-stop shop for recycling and retail sales of such reusable products as these surplus sinks . // One of the keys is composting . Peter Anderson , chairman of the National Recycling Coalition 's policy group , says that 15 percent of the U.S. waste stream is food and another 35 percent is unrecoverable paper , like fast food wrappers soaked in fryer oil . " All of that can be composted , and if we separated it from dry waste and got it out of landfills , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Platt agrees . " You have to get the organics out of the waste stream . And that does n't mean just leaves in the fall , but yard clippings year round . And if you target only newspapers , bottles and cans , you 're addressing 15 percent of the waste stream . You have to go beyond that to include things like oil filters and textiles . " Many communities have found themselves with dramatic savings by the simple expedient of unit-pricing their garbage , a procedure commonly known as " pay as you throw . " The end result of such whole cycle thinking , she says , may not be zero waste , but it will be pretty darn close . Source reduction can be extremely cost-effective . Platt says that moving beyond 50 to 60 percent recycling rates can be expensive , but communities can actually save money by reducing waste at the source . " They actually begin to reduce trash so much they can cut some garbage pickup and shift personnel to recycling-they no longer need two parallel staffs . Platt is the co-author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recyclables sustains 10 times more jobs than landfilling or incinerating . Some of the new ideas add whole new dimensions to the phrase " reduce , reuse and recycle . " Gary Liss , for one , is an advocate of resource recovery parks , several of which have sprung up in California . The idea , he says , is to create one central location for recycling , composting and reuse facilities , together with manufacturing and retailing . The goal is to allow the public to instantly recover value from their waste , while also shopping for goods made from that waste . As in industrial parks , the businesses can share management , space , operating equipment , maintenance and even advertising expenses . In Berkeley , California , a former steel pipe manufacturer has been transformed into a 2.2-acre reuse demonstration project called Urban Ore , featuring departments that retail building materials , hardware , arts and media equipment , as well as a general store . Urban Ore hopes to add satellite businesses that will rebuild and upgrade old computers , make countertops out of recycled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We are using our materials very inefficiently today , " says Liss . " We could produce 100 times the products with the same resources if we were looking at the total system on a holistic basis . And it does n't have to be altruistic . " Liss cites zero waste initiatives that are already underway at such companies as Xerox ( which calls its program " Xero Waste " ) , Fetzer Vineyards and Hewlett-Packard . Here are some industry standouts : * Oregon-based computer printer maker Epson recycles 90 percent of its materials , and disposes of the rest at a wasteto-energy facility ( which produces only 10 percent residue for landfilling ) ; * California 's Fetzer Vineyards has reduced its garbage outflow by 93 percent in the last seven years , and is aiming for zero waste by 2009 . The vineyard composts 12 cubic yards of corks and 10,000 tons of grape seeds every year ; * Mad River Brewery , in Blue Lake , California , diverts 98 percent of its waste from landfills , which leaves only enough garbage to fill two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company 's waste reduction efforts saved it more than $35,000 . The company takes back six-pack containers and donates plastic grain packaging for remanufacture into reusable shopping bags ; * Pillsbury 's baking operations in Eden Prairie , Minnesota , divert 96 percent of their waste , and the company is aiming for 100 percent . The company recycled or reused enough paper in 1999 to save 200,000 trees , 82 million gallons of water and 48 million kilowatts of electricity . Pillsbury uses rented or recycled shipping pallets , and recently increased the recycled content of its folding cartons to 50 percent ; * Xerox , based in Rochester , New York , has adopted the Waste-Free Factory as its ideal . It 's not there yet , but in 1998 the company 's worldwide recycling rate reached 88 percent , saving the company $45 million . There are dozens more examples . Lowell Paul Dairy of Greeley , Colorado , sells milk in returnable and refillable bottles . Collins &; Aikman , carpet makers of Dalton , Georgia , actually achieved zero landfill waste in 1998 while the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use ) . The Amdahl Corporation , a computer software business in Santa Clara , California , has achieved 90 percent waste diversion since 1990 . Legislatures can make waste diversion easier by writing it into law . The disposal ban is gathering force with Massachusetts ' decision to stop allowing cathode ray tubes into its landfills . ( New Jersey is also considering such a ban . ) By 2010 , Massachusetts wants to reduce municipal solid waste by 70 percent statewide . Some 23 states ban some or all yard waste from its dumps , 32 states refuse to accept tires , and 16 states ban large appliances . California 's San Diego County bans materials it deems recyclable . According to Zero Waste America ( ZWA ) , " Recycling goals do not stop waste disposal . Recyclables can end up in landfills and incinerators if there is no disposal ban in place . " Lynn Landes , ZWA 's Pennsylvania-based founder and director , is a vigorous proponent of disposal bans , and she says there would be more of them in effect if the federal government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agency ( EPA ) to task for failing to enforce the Solid Waste Disposal Act of 1976 , which required all states to develop individual plans to maximize waste reduction and recycling . Although there was a 1980 deadline , many states never developed plans . The law itself has n't been enforced since 1987 , when the Reagan administration defended it . Landes notes that even without funding , the law is still in effect and the EPA could be sued in federal court for ignoring it . Bottle bills are hardly a new idea , but they remain a highly effective legislative approach to reducing landfill clutter . Oregon was the first state to put a cash deposit on cans and bottles , in 1970 , and California was the most recent , in 1986 . Since then , though some cities have inaugurated bottle redemption on their own ( most notably , Columbia , Missouri ) , the number of bottle bill states has been frozen at 10 , despite the fact that the laws are extremely effective . According to the Container Recycling Institute ( CRI ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beverage bottles and cans are recycled ; in non-deposit states , that figure is only 40 percent . " Beverage containers are five percent of the waste stream , and with bottle bills we can get them to near-zero waste , " says Pat Franklin , CRI executive director . " If we add deposits in 19 other areas , one for each five percent , the zero waste goal would be in sight . " As Sheehan points out , 55 percent of all recycled containers come from the 10 states with bottle bills . Curbside collection , he said , is no guarantee that bottles or cans will actually be recycled , since a high percentage of such collections are contaminated . " Bottle bills give people a financial incentive to recycle , and the containers collected at redemption centers are clean , giving them a much higher value in the marketplace , " Sheehan says . Why have n't more states adopted bottle bills ? Chalk that up to the incredible lobbying power of the beverage industry , which uses an organization it funds heavily , the anti-litter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The industry also creates grassroots groups to fight its battles on the ground . In Washington , D.C. , for instance , a beverage industry front group called the Clean Capital City Committee spent a record $2.3 million in 1987 to convince voters that a proposed bottle bill would amount to a hidden tax , would mean higher prices for consumers , lost sales and lost jobs . The bill , favored by 70 percent of voters at the outset of industry 's campaign , was ultimately defeated by a 10 percent margin . Since corporate America increasingly treasures a green image , it no longer openly fights environmental initiatives , though its heft behind the scenes is considerable . It has so far successfully dodged responsibility for packaging waste ; fought off bottle bills ; and protected its right to pollute in a myriad of ways . At the same time , these corporations have proven highly vulnerable to embarrassing media campaigns that expose the wolf behind the sheep 's clothing . And a handful of activists are attacking the pressure points , making the case for zero waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
