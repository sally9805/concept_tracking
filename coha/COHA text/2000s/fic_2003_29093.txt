The gift arrived for Alfredo 's seventh name-day . It was n't like his other giftsthe basket of candied cherries , the hobbyhorse , the toy drumnot a gift for a child at all . He opened the little leather pouch and pulled out a fine yellow chain , like the one his big brother , Giorgio , had been given to wear round his neck for his First Communion , but instead of a cross on the end this one had a funny little animal , made of the same yellow stuff as the chain . He stared at it . The body was like that of one of the little brown lizards that lived in the cracks in the brickwork of the bakehouse , except that it had a long tail that curled under its belly , right round behind and over , with the end hanging down beside its front leg with a sharp hook at the tip . And the spread toes had small hooked claws , and not the sucker pads of the bakehouse lizards . The head and face were even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrinkled , like the face of the little gray ape Alfredo had seen at the great Shrove Tuesday fair , sitting on a hurdy-gurdy with a leash round its neck . Except that the monkey had had a huge wide grin , but this thing 's mouth was a little round hole . " That 's a funny animal , " he said . " What is it ? " Nobody answered . He looked up , puzzled , aware of an uncomfortable silence in the room . " What is it , Mother ? " he said again . Mother sighed and looked questioningly at Father . " It 's a present from my brother , your uncle Giorgio , " said Father . " To bring you luck . " " You 're not going to let him wear it ? " said Mother . " Better than not letting him , " said Father , in the voice he used tosettle an argument . " He came to my christening too , " said Giorgio , " but he never came to my name-day , or gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could 've brought one when he came to Alfredo 's christening , but he never even looked at me . I knew he was my rich uncle so I was set to charm the heart out of him , but he pushed straight past in his posh getup and kissed Mama 's hand , all la-di-da . Then he hung over the cradle for a bit , and went off and stuffed himself at the sideboard like he had n't eaten for a month . " " He did n't pay much attention to anyone , " said Mother . " Never does , " said Father . " Better that way . And you are named for my grandfather , not your uncle . " There was an edge in both his parents ' voices that Alfredo did n't notice but remembered later , looking back to what had happened on his name-day . At the time he was busy puzzling over the gift his uncle had sent him . " Yes , but this animal , " he said impatiently . " What is it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a chuckle that Alfredo , also later , realized must have been forced . " Perhaps it will bring you luck , little son of mine . " After the excitements of his name-day Alfredo found it hard to sleep . Restless , he crept down to the kitchen for a mug of water . There were cracks of light around the kitchen door , and the sound of Father 's voice from beyond it . He hesitated . He caught a few words here and there . " . . . has no children , as far as I know . . . renounced my own birthrightI ca n't do that for him . . . make up his own mind when he is old enough to understand . . . " Mother said something , too softly for Alfredo to catch , apart from the note of deep anxiety . Father sighed heavily and answered . " . . . must have its Master . That is the one thing on which he and I ever have been able to agree . " Alfredo crept back upstairs without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . Nobody had been able to tell him much about salamanders , except that they lived in the fire in the heart of certain mountains , and that if questioned they would tell you the truth . He was pleased by the bit about the fire . Though he lived in a hot country , he had always loved the bakehouse , especially the glorious moment when Father opened one of the fire-pit doors to add a fresh log , and the huge orange energy , a power like that of the sun , came streaming out . Oh , to live in the heart of such a fire , like a salamander ! So he wore his uncle 's gift every day , hidden beneath his shirt , even for church , when Mother had asked him to take it off in case the priests found out . She was nervous of people , but especially priests , because Father distrusted and despised them and said so openly , and Mother was convinced the priests would learn about it and make the whole family do horrible penances . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was discovered that Alfredo had a singing voice . There was no musicianship anywhere in the family . Father would bellow popular songs , all on one note , to the rhythm of his dough-kneading . Neighbors said it was hard to believe anyone could sing so badly if he was n't doing it on purpose . And Mother would warble as she went about her work with a more varied but no more accurate use of the scale . When he was smaller , Alfredo 's attempts to copy his parents had combined the worst of both styles , but now he seemed more to be singing for the sheer joy of doing so , unconsciously putting the tunes to rights as he went . Before long he was singing , or attempting to sing , everything he heard , from the indecent ditties of the sardine fishers to some part in one of the convoluted polyphonies of the cathedral . Living near the center of the city , they went there to Mass . Shortly after they had emerged one Sunday , Alfredo was sitting on a low wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival baker and Giorgio larked with some of his cronies across the square . As he waited Alfredo was trying to re-create something he had just been listening to , the Nunc Dimittis at the end of the service , with the high voice of a single choirboy floating like a gliding gull above the waves of sound from the rest of the choir , and then soaring on alone . " Lord , now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace , " he sang , " according to thy word . For mine eyes have seen . . . " A short , fat priest came stalking by , turned and stared at them . Mother gave her usual start of guilt . " Do n't stop , boy , " snapped the priest . " Start at the beginning . . . . Louder . . . " Astonished but delightednobody had ever bothered to listen to his singing beforeAlfredo stood , filled his lungs and sang . The chatter around them stilled . People turned to listen . There were amused bravos as he allowed his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the noon stillness . " The child has a voice , " said the priest . " Who has been teaching him ? " " No one , " stammered Mother . " I do n't know where he got it from . " She made it sound as though Alfredo had picked up his talent in the street and was now being accused of having stolen it .
