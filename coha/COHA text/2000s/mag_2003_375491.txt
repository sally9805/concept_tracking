Much has been written about how Iraqis complicated the task of rebuilding their country by looting it after Saddam Hussein 's regime fell . In the case of the international airport outside Baghdad , however , the theft and vandalism were conducted largely by victorious American troops , according to U.S. officials , Iraqi Airways staff members and other airport workers . The troops , they say , stole duty-free items , needlessly shot up the airport and trashed five serviceable Boeing airplanes . " I do n't want to detract from all the great work that 's going into getting the airport running again , " says Lieut . John Welsh , the Army civil-affairs officer charged with bringing the airport back into operation . " But you 've got to ask , If this could have been avoided , did we shoot ourselves in the foot here ? " <P> What was then called Saddam International Airport fell to soldiers of the 3rd Infantry Division on April 3 . For the next two weeks , airport workers say , soldiers sleeping in the airport 's main @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including alcohol , cassettes , perfume , cigarettes and expensive watches . Welsh , who arrived in Iraq in late April , was so alarmed by the thievery that he rounded up a group of Iraqi airport employees to help him clean out the shop and its storage area . He locked everything in two containers and turned them over to the shop 's owner . " The man had tears in his eyes when I showed him what we had saved , " says Welsh . " He thought he 'd lost everything . " <P> Coalition soldiers also vandalized the airport , American sources say . A boardroom table that Welsh and Iraqi civil-aviation authority officials sat around in early May was , a week later , a pile of glass and splintered wood . Terminal windows were smashed , and almost every door in the building was broken , says Welsh . A TIME photographer who flew out of the airport on April 12 saw wrecked furniture and English-language graffiti throughout the airport office building as well as a sign warning that soldiers caught vandalizing or looting would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done by Iraqis " before the airport fell , says a senior Pentagon official . " The airport was secure when this was done . " Iraqi airport staff concede that some of the damage was inflicted by Iraqi exiles attached to the Army , but these Iraqis too were under American control . <P> The airplanes suffered the greatest damage . Of the 10 Iraqi Airways jets on the tarmac when the airport fell , a U.S. inspection in early May found that five were serviceable : three 727s , a 747 and a 737 . Over the next few weeks , U.S. soldiers looking for comfortable seats and souvenirs ripped out many of the planes ' fittings , slashed seats , damaged cockpit equipment and popped out every windshield . " It 's unlikely any of the planes will fly again , " says Welsh , a reservist who works for the aviation firm Pratt &; Whitney as a quality-control liaison officer to Boeing .
