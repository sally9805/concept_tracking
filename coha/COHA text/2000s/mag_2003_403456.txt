. . . relative body weight , organ size , blood pressure , fat distribution , and hormonal activity affect absorption processing and clearance of various drugs between the genders. // Given the gender-bias in etiology and , indeed in some cases , clinical presentation of disease , it is only befitting that a greater emphasis is being placed on gender specificity of therapeutics . It is a relatively recent occurrence , which is likely to have an impact on dosing , timing and frequency of dispensation of therapeutics and , hence , may propel first steps toward individualized medicine . On the face of it , it may appear curious , even counter-intuitive , that gender could dictate design of therapeutic regimens , for physiological responses to pharmaceuticals and nutritives are expected to be uniform . Yet as a raft of studies have underscored lately , gender plays a significant role in therapeutic outcomes . Two intertwined factors are central to gender-specificity both in susceptibility to disease and response to therapy . Thus , whereas women are more prone to autoimmune diseases , routinely attributed to hormonal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prevalence . Further , for both the better and the worse , anatomy dictates the therapeutic efficacy of a corrective agent . That is , relative body weight , organ size , blood pressure , fat distribution and hormonal activity affect absorption processing and clearance of various drugs between the genders . Ultimately , absorption , distribution , bioavailability and elimination of a drug determine not only its effectiveness but also the extent of side effects associated with a corrective agent . If the total body load of a drug is higher , or it persists in the body beyond its clearance time , it is likely to cause side effects and may even accumulate in sundry organs . For instance , nevirapine , prescribed to arrest replication of the AIDS virus , showed higher blood levels in women compared to men , which resulted in rash , gastrointestinal discomfort and nausea.1 At least partially , excessive blood load of the drug may be due to gender differences in liver function . In effect , liver function influences the incidence and severity of side effects . Likewise , damage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robustness of the renal function . It should be noted , however , that gender considerations solely refer to the effectiveness of a therapeutic/corrective agent and not necessarily to its safety profile . For instance , women respond favorably to and report longer-lasting relief from k-opioids , morphine-like painkillers , than men . In fact , k-opioids may worsen the pain in males.2 Notwithstanding the contentious debate as to which gender tolerates the pain more stoically , examples bespeak a broader issue in health care delivery ; namely , how best to tailor and calibrate dispensation of therapies that maximize benefits while curtailing the extent of side effects and , indeed , prevent tissue accumulation of drugs/nutritives . Implicit in this line of reasoning is that therapeutic regimens must be commensurate with the physiological and metabolic context of each individual . Thus , it is counter-productive to merely inhibit the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone ( DHT ) in prostate maladies without giving due consideration to increased estrogen production in aging males . After all , the severity of damage to the prostate is just as much a function of increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same token , greater or exclusive focus on estrogen replacement m peri- and post-menopausal women can be detrimental to general health . It is a small wonder then that recent reports caution against heart disease and dementia as potential outcomes of long-term hormone replacement therapy . Given but these two examples , recent emphasis on the development of " pink Viagra " of late is intriguing , indeed . Whereas restricted blood flow in a vast majority of men precipitates transient or recalcitrant erectile dysfunction , increased blood flow would be but one component in the rather complex libidinal response in women , for hormonal changes contribute significantly to it . Nonetheless , enhanced blood flow , by the neurotransmitter nitric oxide ( NO ) , to the pelvic floor muscle is indispensable in both men and women . Nutritively , NO is efficiently induced by the amino acid citrulline . The amount of NO produced differs between the genders , however . Women produce 87 percent more NO upon appropriate physiological stimulus than men , which is to say that dispensation of a NO inducer should be accordingly calibrated between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessitated in pre-menopausal women with inadequate or unsatisfactory libidinal response , which could be a result of biogenic factors other than restricted blood flow or hormonal insufficiency . Likewise , due attention is required for dispensation of **26;1901;TOOLONG during pregnancy and lactation , since their metabolites cross the placental barrier and more often than not do tend to appear in the breast milk . In short , unless such considerations are implemented in the development of therapeutic/corrective modalities , the cookie-cutter approach to health care is likely to be fraught with adverse events and conceivably avoid long-term complications . While gender-based analyses are still in short supply , this focus frames broader issues in health care . It is for good reason , then , that clinical trials are designed with due representation not only of the genders but also of various ethnicities . As detailed elsewhere , far from balkanization of health care , paradoxically , this approach may well yield insights in nutritive prevention.4 Reference Selected references : 1 ) Burger , et al .
