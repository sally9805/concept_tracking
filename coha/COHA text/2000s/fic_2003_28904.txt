It seemed like a good idea at the time . Tess Monaghan was sitting outside a bar in the Baltimore suburbs . It was early spring , the mating season , and this bland but busy franchise was proof that birds do it , bees do it , even Baltimore County yuppies in golf pants and Top-Siders do it . " Kind of a benign hangout for a child molester , " Tess said to Whitney Talbot , her oldest friend , her college roomie , her literal partner in crime on a few occasions . " Although it is convenient to several area high schools , as well as Towson University and Goucher . " " Possible child molester , " Whitney corrected from the driver 's seat of the Suburban . Whitney 's vehicles only seemed to get bigger over the years , no matter what the price of gas was doing . " We do n't have proof that he knew how young Mercy was when this started . Besides , she 's sixteen , Tess . You were having sex at sixteen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came after your cousin  --  " " Second cousin , once removed . " " My guess is he 's done it before . And will do it again . Your family solved the Mercy problem . But how do we keep him from becoming some other family 's problem ? Not everyone can pack their daughters off to expensive boarding schools , you know . " " They ca n't ? " But Whitney 's raised eyebrow made it clear that she was mocking her family and its money . The two friends stared morosely through the windshield , stumped by the stubborn deviancy of men . They had saved one girl from this pervert 's clutches . But the world had such a large supply of girls , and an even larger supply of perverts . The least they could do was reduce the pervert populationby one . But how ? If Tess knew anything of compulsive behavior  --  and she knew quite a bit  --  it was that most people did n't stop , short of a cataclysmic intervention . A heart attack for a smoker , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buddy was in serious need of an intervention . " You do n't have to go in there , " Whitney said . " Yeah , I do . " " And then what ? " " You tell me . This was your plan . " " To tell you the truth , I did n't think it would get this far . " It had been six weeks since Whitney had first come to Tess with this little family drama , the saga of her cousin and what she had been doing on the Internet late at night . Correction : second cousin , once removed . The quality of Mercy was definitely strained , weakened by intermarriage and a few too many falls in the riding ring . And perhaps Mercy would have been a trimester into the unplanned pregnancy she had been bucking for , if it were n't for a late-night hunger pang . Mercy was foraging for provisions in the kitchen when her computer-illiterate mother had entered her bedroom just in time to hear the sparkly thrush of music that accompanies an IM and seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Within days , Mercy 's hard drive had been dissected , revealing a voluminous correspondence between her and a man who claimed to be a twenty-five-year-old stockbroker . Mercy 's parents had pulled the plug , literally and figuratively , on her burgeoning romance . But by Whitney 's calculation , that left one miscreant free to roam , continuing his panty census . It had been Tess 's idea to search for Music Loverr in his world . With the help of a computer-savvy friend , they created a dummy account for a mythical creature known as Varsity Grrl and began exploring the crevices of the Internet , looking for those places where borderline pedophiles were most likely to stalk their prey . Whitney and Tess had both taken turns at the keyboard , but it was Tess who lured Music Loverr , now rechristened GoToGuy , into the open . She had finally found him in a chat room devoted to girls ' lacrosse . They had retreated to a private room at his invitation  --  an invitation that followed her more or less truthful description of herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had watched , in almost grudging admiration , as this virtual man began the long patient campaign necessary to seduce a high school girl . As she waited for his messages to pop up  --  he was a much slower typist than she  --  Tess thought of the movie Bedazzled , the original one , where Peter Cook , a most devilish devil , tells sad-sack Dudley Moore that a man can have any woman in the world if he 'll just stay up listening to her until ten past four in the morning . Tess figured a teenage girl could be had by midnight . Not that GoToGuy knew her pretend age , not at first . He had teased that out of her , Tess being evasive in what she hoped was a convincingly adolescent way . She made him wait a week before she admitted she was under twenty-one . Well , under eighteen , actually . Can we still be friends ? she had typed . Definitely , he replied . The courtship only intensified . They soon had a standing date to chat at 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red wine and sit down to her laptop with great reluctance , opening up the account created for just this purpose . Afterward , she showered or took a hot bath.Do you have a fake ID ? GoToGuy had IM 'd her two nights ago . Finally . He had been slow enough on the uptake , although not so slow that he had revealed anything about his true identity , which was what Tess really wanted . No . Do you know how I can get one ? Sure enough , he did . Last night , informed that she had gone and obtained the fake ID , he had asked if she knew of this bar , which happened to be within walking distance of the Light Rail  --  in case she did n't drive or could n't get the family car . And I can always drive you home , he promised . I bet you can , Tess had thought , her fingers hovering above the keys before she typed her assent . Her stomach lurched . She wondered if he had gotten this far with Mercy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tracking software was not perfect . E-mails could have been lost ...
