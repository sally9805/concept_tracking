<p> CAMPBELLSPORT , Wis . <p> The brick church , more than a century old , stands at the junction of two county roads tracing the glacial hills of southeastern Wisconsin . In the field across the way , the summer corn stretches eight feet from root to tassel . <p> This being a Sunday morning , the Rev. Daniel Schultz greets the faithful on the front steps as they arrive for 9 a.m. worship at the Salem United Church of Christ . Pastor Dan , as he prefers to be known , is the only man in the congregation wearing a coat and tie . <p> Over the next hour , he leads the 70 worshipers in a round of " Happy Birthday " for Jim Maul , a longtime member . He invites a half-dozen children to the pulpit , where he crouches among them to teach them to recite " The Lord 's Prayer . " In the part of the service designated for " sharing joys and concerns , " he listens as people rise in the pews to tell of a relative 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Here is ministry at its most venerable , ministry at its most tender and intimate and finely grained . And it comes from a minister with a strikingly unlikely double-life , one part as the small-town preacher in a socially conservative spot of the Midwest , the other as an abrasive and confrontational voice of the religious left in the blogosphere . <p> Exactly one week after Mr. Schultz presided over Sunday worship at his home church here , he gave a sermon in the vast arena of the McCormick Convention Center in Chicago . Instead of the farmers , factory workers and tradesmen who typify his regular congregation , the audience for his denunciation of the Iraq war consisted of the self-proclaimed " netroots " attending Yearly Kos , the annual political and media convention organized by the Daily Kos Web site . <p> For three years , Mr. Schultz has supplied the voice of religion for Daily Kos , an epicenter of left-liberal activity with an otherwise fiercely secular bent . In 2004 , Mr. Schultz began fielding prayer requests every Sunday night as part of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A year later , Daily Kos 's founder , Markos Moulitsas , let Mr. Schultz spin off a formally connected online community , Street Prophets ( www.streetprophets.com ) . <p> In 4.3 million page views since then , Mr. Schultz 's readers have found comparatively little balm in Gilead . True to the take-no-prisoners style of blogosphere discourse , Street Prophets traffics more in calumny and condemnation , though with an extremely learned theological intelligence behind it . <p> " If Conservative Christians are looking for salvation , " Mr. Schultz wrote in one characteristic post , " they ought to start looking to save themselves from themselves . They have much to repent for , like the rest of us . But unlike the rest of us , they have a unique level of judgmentalism and separation to get out of their system . " <p> Besides decrying the religious right on issues like gay rights , abortion and intelligent design , Mr. Schultz has also disparaged even seeming allies like Jim Wallis , probably the most prominent liberal among the evangelical Christian clergy . Mr. Schultz has reviled Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balancing act seems to work , meeting the needs of two wildly disparate flocks and reconciling Mr. Schultz to himself . As someone who suffers from , and is medicated for , bipolar disorder , Mr. Schultz has , of necessity , become an expert on reckoning with extremes . " There 's a part of me that 's been angry since I was a kid , " Mr. Schultz , 39 , said in an interview . " Part of that is my illness , and part of it is a deep sense that the world is n't the place it was meant to be . I had to find a productive place to put that anger or it would swallow me whole . And part of my spiritual journey has been to claim that anger as spiritual . " <p> In choosing the blogosphere as his pulpit , Mr. Schultz forms part of a trend in which liberal members of the clergy are using the Internet the way Christian conservatives used cable television and talk radio in earlier decades . Diane Winston , a professor of religion and media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar figures online as Mr. Wallis , Rabbi Michael Lerner at Tikkun , the Rev. Tim Simpson at PublicTheologian and Rachel Barenblat at Velveteen Rabbi . <p> " The blogosphere offers a new way to organize religious people into political communities , " Ms. Winston wrote in an e-mail message . " For better or worse , it plays to traditional strengths and weaknesses of progressives . " <p> In the more prosaic part of Mr. Schultz 's life , Salem United Church of Christ sought him out last year for eminently practical reasons . The congregation had released its previous pastor . Struggling to survive with about 80 active members , the church was limping along with guest preachers on a weekly basis . <p> Mr. Schultz embodied both familiarity and new vigor . He was a " P.K. "  --  a preacher 's kid  --  who had grown up in his father 's church 80 miles away in Madison . After earning degrees in English and history at the University of Wisconsin , and in the process falling away from religious observance , Mr. Schultz returned to it as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ University in Atlanta . He had pastored a church in Georgia and substituted at several congregations in Pennsylvania before being called by Salem . <p> Along the way , Mr. Schultz chose as his theological heroes Reinhold Neibuhr , Martin Buber and Jack Kerouac . What impresses many congregants here far more , though , is the way Mr. Schultz and his wife , Jennifer Milazzo-Schultz , have enacted their faith by taking in two foster children . He has also managed to express his politics without imposing them . <p> " Over all , we 're a fairly conservative congregation , but everybody loves him , " said Denise Goetsch , a member of the church 's governing board . " Whatever people 's personal politics are , they 're here because they believe in God . And Dan 's been good at making friends with pretty much anybody . " <p> Mr. Schultz 's sermon here the week before Yearly Kos offered a prime example of how . Drawing on a passage from I Corinthians , Mr. Schultz preached for social justice while speaking directly to his humble church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the underdog , " he told the congregation . " I believe in the lost and the lumpy and the people nobody has ever heard of and the towns that do n't quite exist on anybody 's maps . I believe that they are where God has chosen to become incarnate . " ##
