Chapter One : Fifteen Minutes of Fame It was February , cold , and Al " Little Hands " Scarpi was pumping iron outside his double-wide on the outskirts of Las Vegas . Raising the bar over his head , he watched a ponytailed kid on a Harley roar up in a swirl of dust . Parting his leather jacket , the kid removed an airline ticket and spun it like a Frisbee , nailing Little Hands squarely in the chest . " How much you bench ? " the kid wanted to know . " Five hundred , sometimes more , " Little Hands said , wiping his sweaty face with a stained towel . " You lift ? " The kid laughed and revved his hog , as if that was all the muscle he needed . " You on ' roids or something ? " the kid asked . " Steroids are for pussies , " Little Hands said . The kid left and Little Hands went inside his trailer . The ticket was for a noon Nevada Air puddle-jumper to Reno , the return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the confirmation number of a Hertz rental , a four-wheel-drive Jeep Cherokee . Printed beneath that were cryptic instructions . Cal-Neva Lodge ask for Benny . Inside the sleeve was money , five grand in thousand-dollar bills . Little Hands clutched it while thinking about the flight his employer had booked him on . It would be filled with businessmen . Then he imagined himself standing on line at the Hertz counter . More businessmen . Shredding the plane ticket , he went outside and tossed the pieces into the wind . The drive to Reno took eight hours , another hour to navigate the treacherous mountain roads to Lake Tahoe . A light snow had dusted the highway , and he did thirty most of the way . It was a different world up here , the air thin and difficult to breathe , and a pounding headache soon filled his skull . The Cal-Neva Lodge straddled the state line , which was how it got its name . It was dark when Little Hands parked at a casino called Lucky Lil 's , then jogged down the road to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oncoming headlights . He entered the Cal-Neva to the happy sounds of a slot machine paying a jackpot . At the front desk , he learned Benny was on break . Going outside , he found his contact having a smoke by the tennis courts . To his surprise , Benny was a she . " My mother wanted a boy , " Benny explained , blowing a smoke ring that hung eerily in the frigid air . " Ai n't you cold ? " Little Hands shook his head no . " Guess all that muscle keeps you real toasty , huh ? " Benny winked , coming on to him , and Little Hands got up close and breathed in her face . She swallowed hard . " Hey , I was just kidding , okay ? Do n't act so crazy . If you do n't know it , this job is going to make you famous . " " Quit blowing me , " he said . " The guy in Bungalow ten the guy you 're going to whack . You know who he is ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " It 's Sonny Fontana , that 's who , big boy . " Little Hands did n't believe her . Sonny Fontana was the poster boy of professional hustlers and forever banned from stepping foot in Nevada . He 'd ripped off every major casino and never done time . The notion that he 'd be hiding out in this crummy dump was too much for Little Hands to swallow . Sonny Fontana , his ass . Sensing his doubts , Benny said , " Do n't you get it ? The bungalows are technically in California . Nobody can touch Fontana as long as he does n't cross the state line . " Producing a newspaper from her pocket , she said , " See for yourself . " Little Hands held the paper up to the moonlight . It was a photograph of Sonny Fontana taken outside a federal courthouse in Carson City several years ago . Jet-black hair , bushy eyebrows , big Roman nose . A real street guinea . " You positive this guy 's in Bungalow ten ? " " Sure am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteen minutes of fame . " " Right , " he grunted . Beneath a smiling half-moon , Little Hands crossed the grounds . Bungalow ten was surrounded by fir trees . He stuck his face in a side window . A guy in his birthday suit stood inside a tiny kitchenette . Loud music was playing on the radio and an open pizza box sat on the kitchen table . In profile , the guy looked like Fontana , but so did a lot of guys . He took a bottle of vodka from the freezer and left the room . Circling the bungalow , Little Hands found a rear window with light streaming out and resumed watching . Inside , a woman with a shaved crotch sat upright on a four-poster bed while the naked guy refilled her tumbler . Licking her lips , the woman said , " Okay Sonny , let 's see if you 've got any more bullets in that thing . " Little Hands gripped the windowsill . So it really was him . He 'd always dreamed of whacking a big shot and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the woman from behind . They went at it like a couple of porno stars . Just as he was about to climax , Fontana grabbed a cream-colored Stetson off a poster and stuck it on his head . Slapping the woman 's buttocks , he said , " Let 's cross the finish line together , honey ! " Little Hands backed away from the window . Standing in the lonely gathering of trees , he fought back the urge to cry . At the tender age of six , he 'd caught his mother screwing a fireman wearing a red helmet . His mother had picked the fireman up in a bar where he 'd come after battling a four-alarm blaze . Seeing her son 's stricken face , his mother had burst into tears ; the fireman just kept screwing . With his little hands , Little Hands had beaten on the fireman , to no avail . Little Hands went around to the front of the bungalow . He 'd thought about the fireman every day since . And his red hat . Like his mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building inside of him for a long time . He knocked on the front door . From within , he heard feet shuffling . A light on the porch came on . He could feel someone watching him through the peephole . " Hotel security , " he said . The door opened and Fontana stuck his head out . He still wore the Stetson , only now it was perched rakishly to one side . Reeking of vodka , he said , " Yeah , what 's the problem ? " Little Hands stared at him , just to be sure . It was the same guy from the newspaper article ; there was no doubt in his mind . He 'd killed many men in his life , but this one was going to be special . Grabbing Fontana by the throat , Little Hands closed the door on his head . " This is for Mom , " he said .
