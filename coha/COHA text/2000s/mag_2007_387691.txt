Headnote CR 's hard-to-open-packaging hall of shame welcomes new inductees // We thought we had seen it all last year : packaging so frustrating to open that it elicited expletive-filled outbursts from usually mild-mannered CONSUMER REPORTS testers . But in our second contest named after the tight-jawed mollusk , we 've found worthy successors to the 2006 winners . A sealed , hard-plastic clamshell housing a powered toothbrush takes top honors because of the tools , strength , time , and finesse required to extract the contents . Packaging for popular dolls comes in a close second because of the 50 twists , ties , and tapes that shackle the dolls to their plastic and cardboard prison . Honorable mentions include a box of macaroni and cheese that crushed easily , a toy aircraft carrier with hard-to-liberate pieces , and plastic-encased light bulbs we were hard-pressed to extract without breaking the bulbs or slicing ourselves . In fact , this year as last , we heard about cut and bloodied fingers , hands , and arms . And we heard from consumers with arthritis who struggled with simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who used any implement at handpliers , kitchen shears , bolt-cutters , military-issue can openers , hacksaws , files , teeth , and fingernails - to get the job dune . To determine this year 's winners , we asked staffers and visitors to our Web site , ConsumerReports.org , for nominees and sent two reporters and a technical expert to eyeball those products and look for other candidates . The trio returned to our Yonkers , N.Y. , headquarters with 26 contenders . Three volunteers of different ages and strengths tried opening the packages with their hands , then scissors , box cutters , and if all else failed , wire cutters . Then we had a volunteer unfamiliar with the products try to open the worst of the bunch as our technical expert watched . Despite the wealth of bad examples , there 's encouraging news . Improvements are evident in the packaging of many foods and over-the-counter drugs , and some toys . Even the dreaded clamshell is showing signs of user-friendliness . ( See " The good guys , " below . ) With some types @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism . Cereal bags still rip too readily and are n't generally resealable ; and CDs , DVDs , and video games remain shrink-wrapped and imprisoned by security seals . GRAB THE AX Why are so many packages still hard to crack ? Blame crooks , in part . Manufacturers obsess about theft as never before . The National Association for Shoplifting Prevention estimates losses from pilferage at more than $25 million per day . Other reasons : * Federal safety laws require seals that will show evidence of tampering , and child-safety caps on most over-the-counter remedies , though that often makes them adultproof. * Products from abroad must be packed securely enough to withstand a long , bouncy voyage aboard a cargo ship . * With toys , it 's no longer enough to picture what 's inside . Children and parents like to interact with the toy or at least see all the pieces before buying . But try explaining those reasons to a kid . We watched a 7-year-old as she attempted to liberate Bratz Sisterz dolls from their packaging . We gave her safety scissors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she began , the child , noticeably agitated and breathing heavily , freed the dolls , which now looked as if they had just returned from a rough night on the town . Our young tester resorted to ripping the dolls from the packaging . The Sisterz were missing clumps of hair , and strings , plastic tabs , and wires were everywhere . Some of the wires remained stuck around the dolls ' arms . MGA Entertainment , the company that manufactures Bratz dolls , has sympathy for the customers who buy them . " We are in the process of a running change in the packaging that is certain to make the " ties , twists , and tape " problem so much easier to handle , " says Reagan Holmes , the company 's public-relations coordinator . She would n't divulge exactly how the company planned to revamp its packaging . " Manufacturers get pulled in a lot of different directions , " says Laura Bix , assistant professor of packaging at Michigan State University The public " expects prices to remain low , " she says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to be nice looking . " Retailers have expectations , too . They need to guard against pilferage yet attract buyers . " Products need to " pop " off the shelf to catch the eye of even the tiniest consumers , " Bix says . " Manufacturers do make an effort to balance those different expectations . " In the end , says Kay Cooksey , associate professor in Clemson University 's Department of Packaging Science , packaging is perceived by industry as a necessary evil , and manufacturers do n't want to spend more on it than they have to , even if it means compromising usability . Sidebar Tools you can use to crack the case Staffers and visitors to our Web site told us they 'd wield just about anything to break into plastic packages . ( We assume they were joking when they cited bricks , blowtorches , and sledgehammers . ) No wonder a cottage industry has developed among manufacturers looking to cash in on packaging angst . We took several of the more intriguing devices for a test drive . Most work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 Black &; Decker 36V Cordless Powtred Scissors , $20 . This rechargeable tool sawed through even thick plastic edges , though it took an effort . Sold at stores and www.blackanddecker.com. 2 iSlice , $5 . An almost imperceptible , safe-to-touch ceramic blade pokes out of the side . Press down , and the blade cuts . It worked OK on thin plastic ; less so on thick . Sold at www.islice.com. 3 Pyranna , $10 . This one uses an internal blade and wheel . You grip Pyranna , squeeze it around the edge of the clamshell , and slide it toward you . It worked on straight edges , and it 's almost impossible to cut yourself . But it 's not maneuverable across bumps or around rivets , and it requires ample hand strength . Sold at www.pyranna.com. 4 OpenX , $5 . A short retractable blade digs into the plastic to create an opening ( righties will have an easier time ) . Another embedded blade finishes the job . You might get nicked if you lose control , or hurt yourself on plastic edges , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not easily maneuvered around corners . Sold at www.myopenx.com. 5 Ultimate Package Opener by Jokari , about $7 . We had trouble inserting it into a clamshell and dragging the tiny retractable blade along the edge . In fact , the tool slipped past the end of one package and into the leg of our tester . Sold at www . shopgetorganized.com and other sites . And the Oyster goes to ... ORAL-B SONIC COMPLETE TOOTHBRUSH KIT The experience : A tight fit between the plastic skin and cardboard thwarted scissors . Our tester grabbed a box cutter but hacked up the box as an unavoidable result . After removing the clamshell and opening the box , she had to dislodge parts from a foam case , yank off one plastic bag covering the power cord and another protecting additional components , then pop perforations on smaller clamshells shielding the toothbrush heads . Her work table was uttered with sharp plastic shards . BRATZ SISTERZ The experience : As the name implies , these dolls were difficult and unpleasant to deal with . They had about 50 restraints , including @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cardboard banner , plastic bags , rubber bands , hardplastic bands , molded plastic covers , glue , wires , string sewing the hair to the cardboard , a plastic tab imbedded in the heads and pinning them to the cardboard , and a rigid plastic manacle around the arms of one doll , giving her a posture with attitude . HONORABLE MENTION Bright Effects compact fluorescent light bulbs . Our testers had to work carefully to keep from cracking the bulbs and cutting themselves on plastic . VTech V.Smile Joystick . Clamshells for pricey , shoplifted items are one thing , but for a $15 toy ? We had to stab the package , then pull it apart with our hands . Annie 's mac and cheese . The paperboard can collapse if , as directed , you push a finger through the perforations near the bunny 's tail . Long nails help . Military Force Playset Aircraft Carrier . This warship comes with enough pieces to launch an invasion , secured with wires , ties , tape , plastic covers , and screws . One sailor went down with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his helicopter . Sidebar The good guys Manufacturers are starting to get the message from consumers frustrated by balky packaging , says Joe Angel , vice president and publisher of the trade publication Packaging World . " Industry is definitely listening to consumers and their complaints , " Angel says . Indeed , we were struck by the steps we saw companies and stores taking to keep wrap rage at bay : products displayed as empty clamshell esses with a voucher inside that 's redeemed for the real item after you 've paid , or outfitted with anti-theft devices that are removed at checkout , for instance . Here 's other proof that some companies can build a better package : The user-friendly clamshell . No weaponry needed . This Logitech mouse packaging has a perforated corner you bend , splitting the seam in two . ( And clamshells for some batteries are now precut on one side ; you just peel the plastic back . ) The high-tech food bag . The heavy-gauge plastic bag for Arnold croutons has a flat bottom , slits on each side of the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlocking seal found on food-storage bags . The single-dose cold remedy . Zicam Cold and Flu improves on the **25;691;TOOLONG . Each dose comes in a disposable spoon with a peel-back foil lid . The twist-to-open toothbrush . Oral-B , maker of our hard-to-extract Sonic Complete toothbrush kit , got it right with its Cross Action toothbrush , wrapped in a bubblelike plastic case . To open , you grab the ends and twist . The toy without ties . There 's not one twist , tie , band , or stitch restraining the 33 pieces in the Polly Pocket Trendy Pets Paw Spa . Each part sits in a notch in the molded plastic housing , where it 's easily accessible . // <p>
