" It 's so unfair , " says Judy Hill* , whose five children are ages eight to 24 . " When they 're nine or ten , they do n't quite care about how they look . They do n't even want to shower every day . Then , boom , they 're 12 or 13 and suddenly everything matters : their clothes , their hair , boys , girls . And just when appearances become vitally important , acne arrives . " " We still do n't know for sure what causes acne , " says Bernice Krafchik , a paediatric dermatologist at Toronto 's Hospital for Sick Children , " but it is obviously connected to the hormones of puberty . " Hormones , however , are n't the only factor . " Certainly the more oily your skin is , the worse the problem tends to be , and bacteria are also involved . " Hill says establishing a strict cleansing routine with her teens has been the most helpful first step . " Not just washing their hair and faces , but things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pillowcases on their beds every day , cleaning any frequently worn necklaces , " she explains . While cleanliness is not the ultimate acne cure , as many people once believed , Krafchik still tells the teens she treats to establish a cleansing routine . " They should wash their faces three times a day , using a mild soap , and should wash their hair at night , not in the morning , " she says . " I advise avoiding hairspray , mousse and gels , and wearing only water-based makeup . " Since heat - including higher body temperatures from being active or playing sports - tends to increase facial oil production , Krafchik recommends carrying individual packets of alcohol wipes . " When the teen gets hot and sweaty , wiping his face with one of these will remove the extra oil . " While food has often been suspected of contributing to acne , Krafchik says research has n't found a connection . But she points out that the studies on this have been poorly done . " I often have teens who tell me their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , " so I advise them to avoid those foods . " If a cleansing routine does n't clear up the zits and the acne is mild , Krafchik generally advises applying benzoyl peroxide , a topical antibiotic like Dalacin or vitamin A acid for blackheads . More serious and extensive ( back or chest ) acne , where there are cysts or an infection , gets treated with oral antibiotics , or one of the drying lotions mentioned . " Do n't expect any of these treatments to work overnight , " she adds . " It can take a month or more to see the results . " The strongest anti-zit medication is isotretinoin ( sold under the name Accutane ) , according to Krafchik . It can be highly effective , but has many side effects - some quite serious . It was Accutane that finally cleared up 22-year-old Laura Payton 's ten-year struggle with acne . " Now people compliment me all the time on how beautiful my skin is , " she says .

Krafchik acknowledges that a single pimple - or worse , an entire crop of them - can feel like a tragedy to an emotional adolescent . Parents should encourage their teens to keep this in perspective : Help them find the treatments that work , but no , they ca n't stay home from school because they have a pimple .
