FOR WOMEN ONLY // I never thought I ? d write a book about money just for women . I never thought it was necessary . So then why am I doing just that in my eighth book ? And why now ? Let me explain . // All my previous books were written with the belief that gender is not a factor on any level in mastering the nuts and bolts of smart financial management . Women can invest , save , and handle debt just as well and skillfully as any man . I still believe that-why would anyone think differently ? // So imagine my surprise when I learned that some of the people closest to me in my life were in the dark about their own finances . Clueless . Or , in some cases , willfully resisting doing what they knew needed to be done . I ? m talking about smart , competent , accomplished women who present a face to the world that is pure confidence and capability . Do you mean to tell me that I , Suze Orman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strangers , couldn ? t spot the trouble brewing so close to home ? I don ? t think I ? m blind ; I just think that these women became very , very good at hiding their troubles from me . Why not ? They had years of practice hiding them from themselves . // Frankly , I was shocked . It was a real reckoning . It began with a friend , a very high-powered businesswoman who handles millions and millions of dollars a year , who refused to sign will and trust documents I ? d helped her to prepare . I can ? t tell you why , but those papers sat on her desk for three years  --  she clearly had some kind of block that prevented her from simply signing her name and having the documents notarized . Even as I write , she has still not completed them . Then another friend , a woman with some amazing professional credits under her belt , broke down and confessed that she had rung up such staggering bills over the years that she was too terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them off . Not long after , I heard from yet another friend who finally woke up to the fact that her employer was paying her significantly less than every other executive of comparable rank in her company . Her division was one of the most profitable and consistent earners for the company , but still she just accepted the minimal increases her boss would hand her every year at review time . And even now , out of some misguided loyalty , she was reluctant to leave the employer that took advantage of her year after year . // What was going on here ? // Upon further investigation , I learned that so many women in my life-friends , acquaintances , readers , people from my TV audience  --  all had this stumbling block in common : an " unknown factor " that prevented them from doing the right thing with their money . Maybe it was fear of the unknown for some ; maybe for others it was a little streak of rebellion for holding it together in every other part of their lives ; or maybe it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far out of hand , they were embarrassed to ask for help and reveal just how much they didn ? t know . // Women have been thrust into an entirely new relationship with money that is profoundly different from anything we have ever encountered before . The shifting roles of women at home and at work have dramatically changed where and how money interacts with a woman ? s life . Yet what I see is that while women have established or expanded their roles and relationships , when it comes to navigating the financial ramifications of this new world , they are using old maps that don ? t get them where they really want and need to go . // It doesn ? t matter if I am in a room full of business executives or stay-at-home moms , I find the core problem to be universal : When it comes to making decisions with money , you refuse to own your power , to act in your best interest . It is not a question of intelligence ; you absolutely have what it takes to understand what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ t bring yourself to take care of yourself financially , especially if those actions compete with taking care of those you love . Your inner nurturer reigns supreme ; you do for everyone before you do for yourself . // No matter how good your intentions may be , they are nonetheless draining you . // So that is why my eighth book is called Women &amp; Money . // The challenge is to finally learn  --  and accept  --  that to be truly powerful in your life requires making money moves that work for you . Now , I am not suggesting you replace nurturer with narcissist . I do not want you to discard your generosity or shed your supportive and kind nature . This book is not about becoming more by becoming more selfish . Far from it . I simply want you to give to yourself as much as you give of yourself . By taking care of yourself financially , you will truly be able to take care of those you love . // Becoming powerful in a lasting , beneficial way is never done at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good of all . Women are the bedrock of their families , of their communities  --  so many are dependent on us . If we stand strong and know who we are and what we can create , we will easily be able to hold up those we love and those who need a helping hand . // Please know that there is not one sentence of blame within these pages . I appreciate that the incredible multitasking job called your life makes it hard , if not impossible , to find the time , energy , or desire to pay attention to what you are doing wrong with your money , let alone figure out what is the right thing to do . Your kids need mothering , your partner needs loving , your parents need help , your career needs your energy , and your friends need your ear . Throw into that mix the dry cleaning that needs to be picked up , the groceries that need to be bought , the meals that need to be prepared , and the house that needs to be cleaned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with money takes a backseat. // The aim of this book is to make this transformation as easy as possible . // In order to do that , I ? m going to help you toward an understanding of how we got here  --  why we undermine ourselves and why deciding to seize control over our financial lives is , in fact , a groundbreaking , trailblazing decision . I also hope I can provide you with the motivation to want to act , to tackle these challenges head-on and own your power . // I ? ll provide you with the guidance and pragmatic tools to feel secure and in control of your financial life as quickly and as painlessly as possible . To that end , I ? ve come up with a five-month course of action that I ? ve named The Save Yourself Plan to help you over the blocks and set you up for a lifetime of financial security . I ? ve tried to pinpoint why it is that other books have failed you , why your moments of resolve and inspiration inevitably lost their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realistic approach and come up with a strategy that anticipates the fatigue and fear and lack of determination and is designed to keep you engaged , educate you , and-can you believe it ?  --  inspire you to want to do more . I will not overwhelm you with laundry lists of seemingly insurmountable chores . I ? ve identified core tasks-and made them as comprehensive and easy to follow as possible . It is my goal that , at the end of five months , you will be able to chart your progress and feel the pride and relief that come with being in control of a part of your life that has , until now , remained outside your grasp . // And finally , I hope this book will point you toward the future and inspire you , show you what is possible not just for our generation but for generations to come . // Because this is truly the best part : These life-altering changes are an amazing legacy , a gift to every daughter and granddaughter-those who grace your life today and those yet to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this book  --  the one I never planned to write , the one for women only-is the most important book I have ever written . // 2 // IMAGINE WHAT ? S POSSIBLE // A book with the title Women &amp; Money must begin with the story of how far women have come financially in the past three decades . It ? s not only a remarkable tale of social progress , it ? s a reminder for us that changes that take place on a personal level , every day , in small doses , add up to dramatic societal and cultural shifts over time . // Women today make up nearly half of the total workforce in this country . Over the past thirty years , women ? s income has soared a dramatic 63 percent . Forty-nine percent of all professional- and managerial-level workers are women . Women bring in half or more of the income in the majority of U.S. households  --  a growing trend that made the cover of Newsweek and was front-page news in many of the nation ? s newspapers . Women-owned businesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are more women than ever before who can count themselves among the country ? s millionaires , more women in upper management , and more women in positions of power in the government . // We have a right to be proud of our progress . I am so honored to witness this revolution in my lifetime . I only wish it told the whole truth . // Now , would you like to hear the other side of the story ? Ninety percent of women who participated in a 2006 survey commissioned by Allianz Insurance rated themselves as feeling insecure when it came to their finances . Ninety percent ! In the same survey , nearly half the respondents said that the prospect of ending up a bag lady has crossed their minds . A 2006 Prudential financial poll found that only 1 percent of the women surveyed gave themselves an A in rating their knowledge of financial products and services . Two-thirds of women have not talked with their husbands about such things as life insurance and preparing a will . Nearly 80 percent of women said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did you know that women are nearly twice as likely as men to retire in poverty ? // For years now , I have been in the privileged position of talking to thousands and thousands of women a year  --  from the callers to my TV show , to those who come to hear me speak , to those who write me e-mails on my website , to my very own friends and family . So I hear , see , and feel your fears , insecurities , and troubles , very often firsthand , and I have come face-to-face with this painful truth : For all the advancements women have made in the last thirty , forty years  --  and without a doubt they are remarkable accomplishments-I am stunned by how little has really changed in the way women deal with money . There are huge disconnects in play here  --  between what we know and how we act ; between what we think and what we say ; between our ability as achievers and our financial underachieving ; between how we present ourselves to the world and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserve in our lives and what we resign ourselves to ; between the power we have within reach and the powerlessness that rules our actions . // In 1980 , when I was hired as a financial advisor for Merrill Lynch , I was one of the few women in the Oakland , California , office . In the eyes of my ( male ) boss , that made me the perfect candidate to work with all the women who walked through the door . Back then , women who came to a brokerage firm looking for financial advice had , for the most part , either inherited money , received it in a divorce , been widowed , or were suddenly thrust into a position of helping their parents handle their money . In only a few instances had women come in with money they ? d made on their own . No matter the circumstances that brought them to the brokerage firm , they all had the same reason for being there : They did not want the responsibility of managing their money . I always felt they hired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than twenty-five years later , the story is much the same . Regardless of the gains in our financial status , I know and you know that women still don ? t want to take responsibility when it comes to their money . Yes , women are making more money than ever before , but they are not making more of what they make . What do I mean by that ? Your retirement money sits in cash because you haven ? t figured out how to invest it properly , so you do nothing . You ? ve convinced yourself that you ? ll be working forever , so the value of each paycheck becomes meaningless  --  after all , there will always be another one . Your closet houses the wardrobe of a powerful and stylish woman , but the dirty secret is that your credit cards are maxed out and you don ? t know how you ? re going to pay them off . But it ? s not just about saving and investing . It ? s about not asking for a raise at work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ s about the fear and loathing you feel when it ? s time to pay the bills every month because you don ? t know exactly what you have , where it ? s going , and why there isn ? t more left when it ? s all said and done . //
