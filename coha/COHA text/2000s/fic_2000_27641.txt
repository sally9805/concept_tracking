I was eighteen or nineteen years old , working days at the Lovable Underwear Company , when I came to know the poet Ed Sanders . Ed , who twenty years later would win an American Book Award for his poetry , was then the ringleader of the notorious band The Fugs , and he also ran the Peace Eye bookstore , which at that time was on Avenue A. Ed had a degree in classical languages , and could read fluently in their own Greek and Latin those ancient poets that I could only understand through the gauze of translation . I had tried to teach myself Greek from the two volumes of A Reading Course in Homeric Greek that I had robbed from a divinity student a few years before , and I had taken Latin in high school ; but it was beyond me to truly delve the beauties and powers of the poetry of those tongues , as Ed could . He had even studied Egyptian hieroglyphics . We shared , he in his erudite way and I in my unlettered fashion , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the source , the wisps of origin , the wisps of the first and truest expression of all that since had been said . And we both had dirty minds , given as much to the gutter as to the gods . The Lower East Side was a different place back then . It was still a neighborhood . East Thirteenth Street was still known as the Street of Silence , a name I would bestow on another Mafia stronghold , Sullivan Street , in my novel Cut Numbers . The joints were still joints . We drank a lot in those joints . Ed was a great guy . He was about ten years older than I , and was the first real poet to whom I showed my poetry . " Hell , man , " he told me , " you 're a fucking poet . " As I doubt he ever realized he was my first mentor , so I doubt he ever realized what a shove forward , what a turning point , this was for me . That poem , which bore the title " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ novel Trinities , is long gone . Fragments of it follow .
