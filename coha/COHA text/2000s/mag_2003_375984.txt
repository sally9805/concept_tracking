One reason the Republicans managed to snatch the Senate majority away from the Democrats in 2002 was their success in recruiting strong candidates . But G.O.P. recruiting efforts for the 2004 election are running into considerably more trouble . In half a dozen Senate races thus far , Republicans have failed to get their first choices to run . Former G.O.P. Governors Jim Edgar of Illinois and Ed Schafer of North Dakota begged off Senate races , as did Governor Mike Huckabee and former Congressman Asa Hutchinson , the Republicans ' best hopes for unseating Senator Blanche Lincoln in Arkansas . Representative Jennifer Dunn , the G.O.P. 's first choice to challenge Senator Patty Murray in Washington , and HUD Secretary Mel Martinez , a party favorite in Florida , have also said no . And in Nevada , G.O.P. Congressman Jim Gibbons has decided not to challenge Senate Democratic whip Harry Reid , who won his 1998 race by just 428 votes . " I see a very competitive fall in 2004 , " says Senator Jon Corzine , who chairs the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs are more lucrative for some . Others do n't want to give up safe House seats , or they find governorships more rewarding than the highly partisan Senate , where they can get little done . But even though " we could n't live up to the 2002 recruiting , " says a G.O.P. official , the political math still leaves the party " pretty happy where we are for 2004 . " The Democrats need to pick up two seats to win back the Senate  --  a tough assignment , since they have 19 seats to defend , compared with just 15 for the Republicans .  --  By Douglas Waller
