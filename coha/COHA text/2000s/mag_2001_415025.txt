Also , because the ranch house was so understated for such a prominent corner lot , Alex and I finally decided to buy and totally rework the place . " In fact , the Krumdiecks were not the first to see this dilemma . Even a book on the Forest Park neighborhood described the small , one-story brick box as a " non-contributing structure . " Using the surrounding historic neighborhood as their guide , the Krumdiecks sought to reorganize and expand the modest house . To accomplish this , they chose to transform the house into a 2 1/2  --  story bungalow that favored the Arts and Crafts movement . This period of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and natural materials , proved to be an appropriate style for both the location and the couple 's ideas . The transformation from 1950s ranch to quaint bungalow changed the house in startling ways . First , the Krumdiecks added a new living room space to the front of the house . This addition , with its north and south walls composed of French doors and windows , unifies the home with the new gardens and yard beyond . " When illuminated at night , the living room has a lanternlike glow to it , " Alex states . " Fortunately , the solid fireplace sidewall prevents the space from being totally visible to the adjacent street traffic . " In the existing house , Alex and Jeannie gutted the original kitchen and devoted the space to the new dining room . Next , they created a new kitchen by enclosing a back patio . An interesting feature is the amber glass tile , which the Krumdiecks used as a continuous backsplash . To complement the tile , the couple chose dark stained cabinetry , stainless steel appliances , and cypress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Adjacent to the kitchen is the new breakfast room with stairs that were carved from the original den . With its vertical slats that form a rail screen , the stairwell serves as an example of function and style . " Our 2-year-old is a climber , " Jeannie explains , " and the full vertical slats prevent her from doing that and add an accurate Arts and Crafts detail . " Striving to achieve a convincing bungalow feel , Alex and Jeannie tucked the second floor under the new gable roof . This level consists of separate bedrooms and dressing areas for their two daughters , a shared bath , and a centrally located playroom . A home office fits snugly into the gable 's peak . These additions , along with a new detached garage and upstairs studio space , comprise 3,200 total square feet . In keeping with the Arts and Crafts style , the homeowners inserted appropriate design elements wherever possible . Alex replaced all of the existing windows with true divided-light arrangements typical of the early 1900s bungalows . Also , where additions occurred , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by using cedar shingles . Along with the home 's trim , the doors and frames are cypress as well . Photograph WHY THIS ENTRY WON This design solution successfully addresses a concern facing many Southern homeowners : what to do with an existing ranch house in a desirable location . The before-and-after images and floor plans are so different and the transformation so complete , it 's hard to believe that the resulting bungalow developed from the original design . Photograph ( left ) Features such as concrete countertops , cypress floors , and an amber glass tile backsplash give the kitchen a clean look .

To simulate a sense of age , the Krumdiecks installed a terracotta tile arch salvaged from an early 20th-century building as the firebox . They even added glass tiles on the surround similar to those used in the kitchen . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their move across the street was justified . Jeannie concludes , " I 'm confident that Alex and I made the right decision , especially now that we 're known in the neighborhood as the " ranch busters . " Sidebar When Alex and Jeannie Krumdieck reluctantly considered moving from the described Forest Park area of Birmingham , their search would unknowingly lead them no further than just across the street . The two designers  --  Alex , an architect , and Jeannie , an interior designer  --  noticed in the paper that a nearly house was for sale . Interested , they soon realized that the ad pertained to an awkwards ranch-style home that faced their existing one . // <p>
