Montana ranching families want to raise healthier beef for you-and save their way of life . Plus : a rich chili and the best steak you 've ever eaten Photograph A wrangler helps move Rick Jarrett 's cattle down to the main ranch of the Crazy Mountain Cattle Company , among the trees . Photograph A wrangler helps move Rick Jarrett 's cattle down to the main ranch of the Crazy Mountain Cattle Company , among the trees . // Morning across America : Red taillights stretch endlessly ahead on the freeway , cell phones chirp , Escalades cut off Mini Coopers . But not here in central Montana , where Rick Jarrett tugs his lariat from the saddle strap and nudges his cow horse , Foxy , to a trot . Jarrett swings the loop easily as he heads down the sage-covered ridge toward a stray . Wearing a work-stained Stetson and a ratty vest patched with duct tape , he looks like he means business ; the steer 's impressed enough to rejoin the herd . From here Jarrett can see a good chunk of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beartooth ranges and the wilds of Yellowstone National Park . To the north , closer and sharp against the clear morning sky , the ragged peaks of the Crazy Mountains . In between , tucked along Duck Creek , is his " office , " the Crazy Mountain Cattle Company . It 's a pretty picture , but though Jarrett 's a fifth-generation Montana rancher living a 19th-century lifestyle , he has no desire to be a poster boy for the vanishing Old West . If anything , he and a few of his neighbors near Big Timber hope to represent the future of small family ranching . At the very least , they intend to be your answer to that occasional but irresistible craving for a good steak . In the process , their natural , range-fed beef just might make you-and the environment-a little bit healthier . Jarrett actually does have his own traffic to deal with this morning : 10 riders funneling 350 head of cattle through a basin toward a gap leading down to the ranch . Waving hats and ropes , the riders whoop and holler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find each other in the eddies and flows of a bovine river-jostle and push . The air is thick with dust and the pungent scents of trampled sage , manure , and sweaty hides . By the time the last animal has been moved to a pasture overlooking the Yellowstone River , the last gate wire is looped over its post , and the last of the dusty , sore crew has unsaddled his horse , a mountain of food is ready back at the ranch house . Around the kitchen table , the talk drifts from the day 's adventures-a horse spooked by a rattlesnake-to the ongoing drought , the price of beef , and , inevitably , the plight of the family ranch . Photograph Forrier John Cosgriff smooths a hoof before attaching a new shoe on a horse bound for the Cow Camp on the Gallatin. // While cattle ranching has changed since Jarrett 's family settled in Montana in 1862 , it-along with the beef we eat-has changed most dramatically since 1950 . The small Western cattle operation has become dominated by big industrial agribusiness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are increasingly rare exceptions in the cattle industry . " Over the last 10 years , the retail price of beef has increased 50 to 60 percent , " Jarrett says , " but the money has n't trickled down to ranchers ; the buyers and packers have all the control . " And they pocket most of the profits . According to the American Meat Institute , approximately 71 percent of all beef sold in the U.S. is processed and marketed at plants owned by four giant meatpacking companies . The big players in the industry control distribution and pricing , and that 's slowly strangling the ranchers around Jarrett 's kitchen table . Jarrett 's wife and partner , Karen Searle , puts her arm around her 8-year-old granddaughter , Jordan . " The other morning , Jordan was helping us sort some cattle , " Searle recalls , " and as we 're riding along , she looks up at Rick and says , ' Grandpa , someday I want to buy this ranch from you just like you bought it from your granddad . ' " Everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rings hollow . All of these cattlemen , whose roots go generations deep in Montana 's Sweet Grass County , would like to pass their ranches on to their kids , but not one of them is sure he can make it happen . While the consolidation of the beef industry has kept prices relatively low for consumers , it has also drastically changed how cattle are raised and what goes into the meat we now eat . Steaks you 'll find in most major supermarkets today bear little resemblance to steaks cowboys grilled on the range a century ago . Before World War II , when Jarrett 's grandfather ran the ranch , it generally took most ranchers diree to five years to grow an animal from an 80-pound calf to a 1,200-pound steer on the open range with a natural diet of grass . Today , commercial steers typically pack on that weight in 18 to 20 months-half of it gained in huge industry feedlots where penned animals are " corn-fed " a diet that includes corn , " protein supplements " ( which can include chicken feathers ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're also injected with growth hormones . Proponents of " natural " beef claim that meat from grass-fed animals grown without hormones or antibiotics ( except as needed to treat a sick animal ) is healthier for consumers . According to the National Gatdemen 's Beef Association , grass-fed beef is typically leaner than corn-fed and contains slightly more omega-3 polyunsaturated fat and a higher amount of conjugated linoleic acid , which has been shown to have cancer-fighting properties . Cattle that are grass-fed also have much less potential for being infected with mad-cow disease . The morning after the cattle drive , Montana cattle broker Steve Christensen stops by for coffee . With help fromjarrett and a few other like-minded ranchers , Christensen has started the Montana Branded Beef Association . " I 'm seeing the market for natural beef growing 25 percent to 30 percent a year , " he says . While the cooperative was still working on its marketing plan at press time , Christensen 's biggest challenge is " finding a packer and distributor who will process our beef separately from all the factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in tape-patched vest , with family and friends at the ranch ; a rusting car is n't junk , it 's a spare-parts cache ; calves get numbers , not names , at Crazy Mountain Cattle Company .

The challenge for consumers is finding it-and deciphering the words on the package labels ( see below ) . Later that morning , farrier John Cosgriff stops by to shoe horses that-along with most of the cattle-will soon be trucked up to Jarrett 's summer grazing leasehold in the Gallatin National Forest on the edge of Yellowstone National Park . While wolves have become a problem there-in 2003 Jarrett lost a 500-pound calf to a pack of 12 wolves-the supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part of his operation . Jarrett watches as Cosgriff carefully taps on a new shoe . " It 's not just money , " Jarrett says . " Cow camp is a part of our heritage-it 's the most romantic thing we do . The mountains there are so pristine , and there 's so much wildlife-working up there just brings out the inherent goodness in people . " Photograph " We do most ranch work on bikes or ATVs , " says Jarrett , " but cattle are still best moved the traditional way-by horse . " // After adjusting the irrigation on the upper pasture ( Jarrett insists he 's " really more of a farmer than a rancher " ) , he pauses to watch 16-year-old stepdaughter Saundra training a horse in the old log corral near the barn . She gently works the 2-year-old gelding , trotting bareback around a massive snubbing post sunk deep in the packed earth . " My grandfather used to break colts here , " he says . " This corral has seen everything over the years , from brandings to family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of living . " As determined as Jarrett and his neighbors are to keep on ranching , ultimately the biggest threat to their survival may not be the price of beef , the weather , the wolves , or even the beef industry 's favorite **28;2534;TOOLONG and government regulators . It may be themselves . The town of Big Timber , once the region 's largest wool producer , today has only 1,700 residents , but Montana State University Extension agent Marc King , who works with both farmers and government agencies in Sweet Grass County , says the face of that population is starting to change . " Most every ranch in this county has been in the family for at least three or four generations , " explains King , " but as those families are forced to sell , new owners are taking the land out of production . " Last spring , for example , an out-of-state partnership including former anchorman Tom Brokaw and actor Michael Keaton purchased a 640-acre ranch for a reported $8 million , creating a private hunting and fishing preserve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ranchland in the heart of the region . " The fact is that working ranchland here is more productive for wildlife than nongrazed lands , " says King . " Ranchers here have been good stewards , providing for wildlife , keeping exotic weeds under control , and restoring watersheds to improve water quality . I ca n't say that for a lot of the newcomers . Taking the land out of production increases fire danger , degrades the habitat for wildlife , and endangers native grasses . " Still , the rising price of land makes it more attractive for ranchers to cash out . " The way things are going , " King says , looking Jarrett straight in the eye , " I 'm having a hard time believing ranching will continue to be a mainstay in our county . " The next morning , the Jarrett clan heads over to the Terland Ranch to help Terry Terland with branding-still the only foolproof way of determining cattle ownership . In this close-knit community , where neighbors help each other , branding is a seasonal chore that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top rail of the corral and gossip and laugh as boys and girls in cowboy hats , boots , and chaps try to rope the hind hooves of skittering calves . By the time the dust has setded , everybody 's hungry . Down by the creek , in the shade of old cottonwoods , Terland 's sister , Sheryl Richert , has platters of baked beans , biscuits , and beef kabobs stacked on the fold-down tailgate of her chuckwagon . Among the families digging in are a couple of out-of-state visitors . Ten Sweet Grass County ranches have started Montana Bunkhouses Working Ranch Vacations . " It 's not a dude ranch , " explains Karen Searle as she serves up blueberry cobbler . " It 's for families that want to experience firsthand what life on a ranch is really like . Even a few days give people a genuine appreciation of the value of the small Western rancher , " she says . Later , Jarrett sips a cup of camp coffee down by the stream . " The truth is , the economics of ranching up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are too ornery to admit it and too stubborn to quit , so we have to find ways to pull together to survive . " As he watches the older kids showing the younger ones how to skip stones , his voice softens . " We have to make it work . We 're not just businesses , and for most of us , selling is n't an option . We do n't look at the land as something we inherited from our fathers . It 's like a trust-we 're really borrowing it from our children .

Most beef sold in markets comes from animals that spent much of their life packed into feedlots , being fattened quickly on grain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat that carries the flavor we 've come to love . But shoulder-to-shoulder feed-lot conditions and the fact that grain is an unnatural diet for cattle-it makes them sick-require constant doses of antibiotics . And the desire for quick profits calls for the use of growth hormones . Alternative beef is increasingly available . Here 's what the labels mean . * Free-range Not regulated , but generally means that the animal was not confined to a feedlot . Does n't preclude hormones or antibiotics . * Grass-fed The animal 's main diet was grass , not grain . Grass-fed beef is leaner than grain-fed ; it has less saturated fat and more omega-3 fatty acids . The grass-fed claim on a label is not independently verified , however , and producers may " finish " the cattle on grain ( usually without the hormone and drug additives ) . * Natural Officially-that is , according to the USDA-all raw beef is natural because it 's minimally processed and contains no artificial ingredients or preservatives . In practice , though , most producers of all-natural beef avoid hormones , antibiotics , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( without additives ) in a feedlot. * Organic Federally regulated since 2002 . Indicates that the animals were raised without antibiotics or growth hormones , had access to a pasture , and were fed organically produced , plant-based feed ( could be grain or grass ) . Vaccines are allowed .
