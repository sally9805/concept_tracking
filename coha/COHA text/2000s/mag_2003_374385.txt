Pardon the personal question , but have you ever had a sexual fantasy involving the use of a nonliving object  --  Anna Kournikova 's tennis outfit , say , or Tom Cruise 's Risky Business skivvies ? Actually , do n't answer that  --  we really do n't want to know  --  and you should probably think twice before telling your therapist . She might diagnose you with fetishism , which is listed along with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder in a curious but extremely influential book called the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , or DSM for short . <P> The DSM lists the criteria used by mental-health professionals to make their various diagnoses , from " mild mental retardation " ( the first listing ) to " personality disorder not otherwise specified " ( the last ) ; there are more than 350 in all . Hence this 943-page doorstop is one of the most important books you 've never heard of . And the inscrutable process of writing it is starting up again . The American Psychiatric Association ( A.P.A. ) , the manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book . The new edition , the fifth  --  called DSM V  --  will appear around 2010 . Evidently , it takes a long time to figure out all the ways America is nuts . <P> The first official attempt to measure the prevalence of mental illness in the U.S. came in 1840 , when the Census included a question on " idiocy/insanity . " From that single category flowered many more disorders , but each asylum classified them differently . The DSM was first published in 1952 so that " stress reaction " would mean the same in an Arkansas hospital as it does in a Vermont one . <P> The DSM works like this : imagine you are Tony Soprano in the first season of The Sopranos . You have , in DSM-ese , " recurrent , unexpected panic attacks . " You also have " persistent concern about having additional attacks , " and you fear you 're " losing control , having a heart attack , ' going crazy . ' " You are n't on drugs ( other than all those bottles of Vesuvio 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a diagnosis of panic disorder , DSM No. 300.01 . By the way , if you truly think you are Tony Soprano , see No. 295 , schizophrenia . <P> Of course , in the real world , psychiatric diagnosis does n't  --  or at least should n't  --  work like a checklist at a sushi counter . Many of the items that appear as diagnostic criteria in the DSM are sometimes symptoms of a disorder and sometimes signs of perfectly normal behavior . An adolescent who " often argues with adults " may have an unusual condition called " oppositional defiant disorder " or a more common condition called " being 14 years old . " The DSM includes a cautionary statement saying it takes clinical training to tell the difference . But many nonspecialists use the book too : insurers open the DSM when disputes arise over the proper course of treatment for particular conditions . ( If your treatment does n't jibe with the DSM , you may not get reimbursed . ) DSM diagnoses can be used by courts to lock you in a mental hospital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A DSM label can become a stigma.
