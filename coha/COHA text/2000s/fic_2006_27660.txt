The Color of Law By Mark Gimenez Random House Mark Gimenez ONE What 's the difference between a rattlesnake lying dead in the middle of a highway and a lawyer lying dead in the middle of a highway ? " He paused . " There are skid marks in front of the snake . " His bar association audience responded with polite laughter and diplomatic smiles . " Why did New Jersey get all the toxic waste dumps and California get all the lawyers ? " He paused again . " Because New Jersey had first choice . " Less laughter , fewer smiles , a scattering of nervous coughs : diplomacy was failing fast . " What do lawyers and sperm have in common ? " He did not pause this time . " Both have a one-in-a-million chance of turning out human . " All efforts at diplomacy had ended . His audience had fallen deathly silent ; a sea of stone faces stared back at him . The lawyers on the dais focused on their lunches , embarrassed by their guest speaker 's ill-advised attempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if stunned . He turned his palms up . " Why are n't you laughing ? Are n't those jokes funny ? The public sure thinks those jokes are funny , damn funny . I ca n't go to a cocktail party or the country club without someone telling me a stupid lawyer joke . My friends , we are the butt of America 's favorite jokes ! " He adjusted the microphone so his deep sigh was audible , but he maintained steady eye contact with the audience . " I do n't think those jokes are funny , either . I did n't go to law school to be the butt of cruel jokes . I went to law school to be another Atticus Finch . To Kill a Mockingbird was my mother 's favorite book and my bedtime story . She 'd read a chapter each night , and when we came to the end , she 'd go back to the beginning and start over . ' Scotty , ' she 'd say , ' be like Atticus . Be a lawyer . Do good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bar , is the fundamental question we must ask ourselves : Are we really doing good , or are we just doing really well ? Are we noble guardians of the rule of law fighting for justice in America , or are we just greedy parasites using the law to suck every last dollar from society like leeches on a dying man ? Are we making the world a better place , or are we just making ourselves filthy rich ? " We must ask ourselves these questions , my friends , because the public is asking the same questions of us . They 're questioning us , they 're pointing their fingers at us , they 're blaming us . Well , I 've asked myself these questions , and I have answers , for myself , for you , and for the public : Yes , we are doing good ! Yes , we are fighting for justice ! Yes , we are making the world a better place ! " And ladies and gentlemen , if you elect me the next president of the state bar of Texas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remind them that we wrote the Declaration of Independence and the Bill of Rights , that we fought for civil rights , that we protect the poor , defend the innocent , free the oppressed . That we stand up for their inalienable rights . That we are all that stands between freedom and oppression , right and wrong , innocence and guilt , life and death . And I will tell the people that I am proud , damn proud , to be a lawyer . . . because lawyers-do-good ! " Now , some might blame the Texas summer heat , but the audience , lawyers all-lawyers who had never protected the poor or defended the innocent or freed the oppressed , lawyers who stood up for the rights of multinational corporations-believed his words , like children who were old enough to know the truth about Santa Claus but who clung desperately to the myth anyway . They rose as one from their seats in the main dining room of the Belo Mansion in downtown Dallas and , with great enthusiasm , applauded the tall thirty-six-year-old speaker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair off his tanned face , and flashed his movie-star smile . He took his seat on the dais behind a nameplate that read A. Scott Fenney , ESQ. , Ford Stevens LLP . As the applause grew louder , the corporate tax lawyer whom Scott was campaigning to succeed as the next state bar president leaned in close and whispered , " You know , Scotty , you 've got an impressive line of bullshit . Now I see why half the coeds at SMU dropped their drawers for you . " Scott squeezed the knot of his silk tie , smoothed his $2,000 suit , and whispered back through brilliant white teeth , " Henry , you do n't get laid or elected telling the truth . " He then turned and again acknowledged his fellow members of the bar , all standing and applauding him . Except for one lawyer . Sitting alone in the back of the dining room , at his usual table , was an older gentleman . His thick white hair fell onto his forehead . His bright eyes remained sharp at long distances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was not a tall man , and his slightly hunched posture made him appear almost short . Even so , he was a lawyer the other lawyers either avoided outright or approached with great caution , like vassals to their lordship , waiting patiently for him to look up from his chicken-fried steak , mashed potatoes , and pecan pie and acknowledge them with a nod or , on the best of days , a brief handshake . But never did he stand . Come hell or high water , United States District Court Judge Samuel Buford remained seated until he was through eating . Today , though , as he dwelled on the young lawyer 's speech , a slight smile crossed his face . A. Scott Fenney , Esq. , had just made a tough judicial decision easy . TWO The Ford Stevens Law firm occupied floors fifty-five through sixty-three in Dibrell Tower in downtown Dallas . The firm 's remarkable financial success was predicated on its two hundred lawyers billing an average of two hundred hours a month at an average of $250 an hour , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ racking up average profits per partner of $1.5 million , putting the Dallas firm on a par with Wall Street firms . Scott Fenney had been a partner for four years now ; he pulled down $750,000 a year . He was shooting to double that by the time he was forty . One of fifty partners , his perks were many : a personal secretary , two paralegals , and four associates working under him ; reserved parking in the underground garage ; dining , athletic , and country club memberships ; and an enormous corner office on the sixty-second floor facing due north-the only direction worth facing in downtown Dallas . He especially loved his office , the wood-paneled walls , the mahogany desk , the leather furniture , the genuine Persian rug imported from Iran on the hardwood floor , and on the wall , the five-foot-square framed field-level blowup of himself , number 22 on the SMU Mustangs , running for 193 yards against the Texas Longhorns the day Scott Fenney became a local football legend . Keeping all these coveted perks required only that Scott serve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disciples showed Jesus Christ . It was an hour after his bar association speech , and Scott was standing on his Persian rug and admiring Missy , a twenty-seven-year-old ex-Dallas Cowboy cheerleader who ran the firm 's summer clerkship program . In the fall of each year , Ford Stevens lawyers fanned out across the country to interview the best second-year students at the best law schools in the nation . The firm hired forty of the top candidates and brought them to Dallas the following summer to work as summer clerks for $2,500 a week plus room and board , parties , alcohol , and at some firms , women . Most partners in large law firms had been frat rats in college , so most summer clerkship programs had all the markings of fraternity rush . Ford Stevens 's program was no exception . Thus the first Monday of June brought the invasion of forty summer clerks , like Bob here , each trying to catch the eye of powerful partners , the partners in turn trying to divine if these budding legal eagles were the Ford Stevens type @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the law student standing next to Missy , he was dreaming of having just such an office one day . Which meant he would bill two hundred hours a month for the next eight years without complaint or contempt , at which time the firm would show him the door-the odds of a new associate making partner at Ford Stevens being one in twenty . But the ambitious students still signed on because , as Scott himself told them , " You want odds , go to Vegas . You want a chance to get filthy rich by the time you 're forty , hire on with Ford Stevens . " " Mr. Fenney ? " Scott pulled his eyes off Missy and turned to his frumpy middle-aged secretary standing in the door . " Yes , Sue ? " " Four calls are holding-your wife , Stan Taylor , George Parker , and Tom Dibrell . " Scott turned back to Missy and the student and shrugged . " Duty calls . " He shook hands with the pale , homely , top-of-his-class student and slapped him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , I 'm sorry . Now , Rob , my Fourth of July bash , that 's mandatory attendance . " " Yes , sir , I 've already heard about it . " To Missy : " You bringing some girls over this year ? " " Ten . " " Ten ? " Scott whistled . " Ten ex-Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders . " The firm paid each girl $500 to spend a few hours in bikinis acting interested in law students . " Bob- " " Rob . " " Right . You 'd better work on your tan , Rob , if you want to snare one of those cheerleaders . " Rob grinned even though he had about as much chance of getting a date with an ex-Dallas Cowboy cheerleader as a one-legged man had winning a butt-kicking contest . " Mr. Fenney , " Rob said , " your speech at the bar luncheon , it was truly inspiring . " First day on the job and the boy was already brownnosing like an experienced associate . Could he possibly be sincere ? " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if the wink was because she knew his speech was bullshit or if she was flirting again . Like all good-looking single girls in Dallas , Missy had made flirting an art form , always managing to catch his eye when crossing her long lean legs or brush against him in the elevator or just look at him in a way that made him feel as if they were on the brink of an affair . Of course , every male at the firm felt that way about Missy , but Scott was annually voted the best-looking male lawyer at Ford Stevens by the firm 's female support staff , not that it was much of a contest . Scott had been a star football player in college ; most lawyers were star chess players . Like Bob here . " Rob . " " Right . " Missy and Bob departed , and Scott went around behind his desk and sat in his high-backed leather chair . His eyes found the phone ; four lines were blinking . Without conscious thought , his trained mind instantly prioritized the calls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had paid the firm $3 million last year , Stan $150,000 , George $50,000 , and his wife nothing . Scott picked up the phone and punched Tom 's line . " Mr. Fenney ! " Scott was waiting impatiently for the elevator in the lobby of the sixty-second floor , on his way to see Tom Dibrell on the sixty-ninth floor . He could not restrain a smile . He was blessed with the kind of rich client lawyers dream about : a real-estate developer addicted to the deal ; a client who habitually borrowed , bought , built , leased , sold , sued , and got sued , and , most important , who possessed an uncanny knack for getting himself into one precarious legal predicament after another , extrication from which always requiring the very expensive legal services of A. Scott Fenney , Esq . Sue arrived , her face flushed from running after him . " Mr. Fenney , you have the partnership meeting at two . " Scott checked his watch : 1:45 . " I ca n't make it . Tom needs me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the partnership meeting agenda . Only one item required his vote : the termination of John Walker as a partner in the firm . Unlike Scott , John was no longer a blessed lawyer . His rich client had just been bought out by a New York company , which meant his client would no longer be paying legal fees to Ford Stevens ; and which now meant John Walker would no longer be employed at Ford Stevens . His $800,000 salary had just become an unnecessary expense to the firm . John was a brilliant lawyer , and he and Scott played hoops together twice a week , but this was business : brilliant lawyers without rich clients were worthless to a large law firm . The elevator doors opened just as Scott reached into his coat for his pen . He stepped inside and Sue followed . Attached to the agenda was a partnership ballot : TERMINATION OF JOHN WALKER . The only partner in the firm who did n't know John Walker would be fired today was John Walker . Dan Ford believed surprise was critical when firing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door with a few of the firm 's clients . So in fifteen minutes John Walker would walk into Dan 's office , be unceremoniously fired after twelve years with the firm , and then be escorted from the building by security guards . The firm had never lost a single client to a terminated lawyer . Sue turned and offered her back ; Scott put the ballot against her back and his pen to the ballot and started to sign A. Scott Fenney-but he froze . He felt guilty , even though his vote was a mere formality , a nod to the illusion that the Ford Stevens law firm was a partnership of equal lawyers . In fact , Dan Ford owned the firm and every lawyer , office , desk , and book in the firm ; and Dan had already decided to fire John Walker . Scott could either rubber-stamp Dan 's decision or refuse and . . . what ? . . . join John in the unemployment line ? He sighed and signed the ballot in the for column , then handed the ballot back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She stared at the ballot like it was a death warrant and then said , almost in a whisper : " His wife has breast cancer . " " Dan 's ? " " No . John Walker 's wife . His secretary said it 's in her lymph nodes . " " You 're kidding ? Jesus , she 's young . " Scott 's mother had been young , too , only forty-three , when the same cancer had killed her . Scott had watched helplessly as she lost her breasts , her hair , and her life . He now thought of John 's wife and of John , who would soon be standing on the street outside this building , coat and career in hand , cursing his partners for abandoning him and God for abandoning his wife , just as Scott had cursed God as the cancer consumed his mother 's body ounce by ounce until she felt like a feather pillow when he lifted her from the bed and carried her to the bathroom .
