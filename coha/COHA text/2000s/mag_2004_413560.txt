Everyone seemed rarin ' to make another Indiana Jones sequel this summer . ( Go figure . ) The studio was salivating for it . Steven Spielberg was ready with a script . But then the only man who really mattered blinked . BY KIM MASTERS // MAYBE IT WAS that giant boulder . But one evening in February 2000 , Steven Spielberg and George Lucas went to an American Film Institute dinner honoring Harrison Ford , and soon after they watched that image of rolling doom on the screen , they decided to get serious about bringingback Indiana Jones . In some ways , reviving the franchise seems like an obvious idea . What a collection of talent ! What a collection of grosses ! But a lot has happened since the Lost Ark was raided in 1981 . And many in Hollywood doubt that doing it again is a good idea . " How old is Harrison Ford now ? Sixty-five ? " asks a big-name director who has worked with the star . " Who wants to see that ? " ( Ford will actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that people say this about men once in a while . ) And there could also be an issue of concept fatigue . How many of the kids who make up the heart ( not to say the brain ) of today 's audience care about Indiana Jones ? " This is a movie for old people at this point , " says the marketing executive of one studio dismissively . And the idea of paying homage to the old serials was fresh when Spielberg and Lucas cooked it up , but since then we 've seen The Mummy , Tomb Raider , and , well , even Hidalgo . But none of these problems seem to be what has bedeviled-and probably doomedthe project . Paramount , no doubt with an eye to those grosses , did what any studio would do and said yes . For Paramount in particular , being associated with a renowned blockbuster sounded good then and probably sounds even better by now . The studio has been starved for hits and bad-mouthed for being cheap , risk averse , and talent unfriendly . So linking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public-relations value even if the profit might not be huge . And with this group of talent , it 's hard to figure how a studio comes out very far ahead . Normally , between the two of them , Spielberg and Ford would take more than 40 percent of the gross . If Sean Connery is in the mix , as rumor had it , that could be another 10 percent . So maybe half the profits are gone , and whatever 's left over ( at least according to the original Indy deal ) would have to be split fifty-fifty with Lucas , who owns the franchise and produces the films . Still , according to a knowledgeable source , everyone sacrificed something to make it work . " No one 's going to make a fortune , " this source says . " There are four very powerful entities involved . " To he sure , the deal was n't as tough as Fox 's for the Star Wars series . Fox goes to all the trouble of releasing those moviesand it 's not the work of an afternoon-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own the negatives and does n't participate in the merchandise licensing . ( The only filmmaker who has managed to control and collect on a scale comparable with Lucas is . . . Mel Gibson . ) On the other hand , Fox does n't pay the bills . " You 're in a risk-free environment , " explains an executive formerly involved in those negotiations . " If it grosses a lot , it 's not bad money . " Paramount would have to pay the Indy bill , but a top executive there says the studio managed to work out a reasonable deal . Another says Lucas and Spielberg could be relied on to keep the budget somewhere below " a fortune . " And these executives say they were heartened last year by the more than $150 million worth of sales for the DVD box set of the first three Indiana Jones movies ( though , of course , they did n't know about that when they agreed to make Indy 4 ) . Still , the deal required negotiation that was , by the account of yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Viacom entertainment chief Jon Dolgen undoubtedly squeezed out what he could for the studio , there was one factor he could n't change : Paramount was to have no control over the project . The studio would finance development of the script , and after a time the Indiana Jones team was to return with a screenplay , cast , and proposed budget . Paramount was to have a short window in which to pull the trigger . So , no , it does n't seem to be financing or opportunity or the changing movie marketplace that is proving to be the problem with bringing Indy back . That apparently has more to do with the Dark Lord himself , George Lucas-one of the few forces in the universe that can get between Spielberg and anything he wants to do . EVEN THOUGH LUCAS and Spielberg have talked about a sequel off and on since 1993 , this time it looked as though they were really moving . And it 's easy to understand how they might have been tempted to go back to a time in their careers when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and emerging as the formidable players that they would become . The principals blocked out time on their calendars to get the movie done . To everyone 's delight , M. Night Shyamalan-blazing hot off The Sixth Sense-was interested in writing the script . But the deal-making ground on for so long that Shyamalan dropped out . Paramount eventually turned to Frank Darabont , who wrote not only The Shawshank Redemption and The Green Mile but a number of installments of the Young Indiana Jones Chronicles television series . Darabont was thrilled . Meanwhile , Lucas was immersed in completing the latest installments of the Star Wars saga , the next of which will be released in 2005 . By the accounts of those who have worked with him , he is n't one to multitask when he 's making a film . That left Spielberg and Darabont to work out the script . Imagine Darabont 's joy when Spielberg pronounced that he liked Darabont 's draft , except for some quibbles with the third act . Darabont reworked the screenplay , and a few weeks later-last fall-Paramount was told that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then everything went silent . The problem , by all accounts , was Lucas . He did n't like the script-which Paramount executives never got to see . Darabont , apparently , was stunned . At a film festival earlier this year , he went so far as to finger Lucas as the culprit , explaining that Spielberg had deferred to his partner out of respect for their " long and close friendship . " And by several accounts , that seems to be the case . ( Darabont , Spielberg , and Lucas all declined to be interviewed for this article . ) Spielberg told an associate that he felt Lucas yielded to him on certain issues when they made the last installment in the series-Lucas had reservations about casting Connery as Indy 's dad , for example-and that he felt it was his turn to return the favor . What followed Darabont 's rather mild statement was an explosion of postings on film-geek Web sites , many reviling Lucas for his plan to rework Darabont 's script . " If George Lucas was n't already on the shit lists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , " raged one . " What kind of ego must it take to turn a go-picture with Steven Spielberg into a development deal ? " And therein lies a tale of remarkable transformation . THE STORY OF HOW Spielberg and Lucas cooked up the idea for Raiders of the Lost Ark on a beach in Hawaii is part of Hollywood lore . It happened in 1977 , when Spielberg was riding high on Jaws . Lucas was promising but not yet anointed : Star Wars was opening that very week , and the numbers were huge . Lucas had been so worried that he left the mainland when the picture opened . Spielberg had insisted the picture would be a hit . The two were friends-and rivals . Lucas had already vowed that he would make a film that would surpass Jaws . " He was always more competitive with me than I was with him , " Spielberg says in Peter Biskind 's book Easy Riders , Raging Bulls . Before Star Wars opened , they wagered on its grosses versus those of Close Encounters of the Third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spielberg bet that Star Wars would win . In fact , Star Wars crushed Close Encounters and surpassed Jaws to become what was then the highest-grossing film of all time . Spielberg and Lucas had changed the landscape of filmmaking . Spielberg established the **39;2269;TOOLONG while Lucas demonstrated the power of merchandising . By the time they were ready to make Raiders , their situations had changed . Spielberg was coming off the overbudget and potentially career-ending bomb 1941 . Meanwhile , Lucas was making unheard-of deals for the sequels to Star Wars . The man who had emphatically rejected the Hollywood system would pay for the pictures and own them . He would control everything . ( Spielberg , by comparison , has never risked his own money on a film . ) When Raiders was made , Lucas 's terms were so tough that executives at other studios were appalled . How odd to remember that it was the famously tight-fisted Michael Eisner , then the young head of Paramount Pictures , who defied the town to make the deal . When he heard about it , MCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a deal that 's going to destroy this business ! " That did n't happen . With the help of Raiders , Spielberg quickly recovered and went on to establish himself as one of the most skilled and commercially potent directors in history . Some may debate his artistic success , but Spielberg has stretched in many directions , from Jurassic Park to Schindler 's List to A.I. Meanwhile , Lucas has been in the vanguard of technological change , but as a moviemaker , he has emerged as something quite different . " One has continued to be the most successful filmmaker in the world , " says a former studio chief who has worked with both . " The other is certainly the most successful businessperson . George Lucas is primarily a businessman . " In fact , in the eyes of many film fans , he has become the evil empire itself . " Over the years , George-who used to be the coolest god of creativity-has become the archenemy of every blogger and every geek , " marvels a longtime Lucas associate . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " Lucas has continued to mine the same vein as his returns have diminished , artistically if not financially . " There 's something almost constipated about what 's happened to his artistic vision , " laments the associate . " Look how dead the last few movies have been . So rigid and stiff . " Lucas presents himself as being impervious to these criticisms , and some of those who have worked with him accept that he actually is . " Everybody hates Jar Jar , but he just cackles about it and says it 's the **25;2310;TOOLONG figure , " says the associate . ( Lucas was almost certainly kidding , since he knows that 's not true . ) In his long-standing resentment of Hollywood , it seems , the deal has become Lucas 's art form . " It 's very rare that somebody will go for all blood , " says a former Fox executive . " But he bled everyone . " While the studio was protected from risk , the toy companies were not . When the action figures did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the results were disastrous . " Most of us try to make good deals , but George-he made killer deals across the board . I mean killer , " says a licensing executive at another studio . " I think it took Hasbro four or five years to recover . . . . It really set the whole licensing business back . People were saying our business was dead after that . " These days , associates paint a picture of Lucas as a man , in the words of his onetime biographer , Dale Pollock , " cocooned in his own world " at Skywalker Ranch-a man pleasing nobody but himself . Some wonder whether Lucas , still feeling the old competitive instinct , is jealous of Spielberg 's success as a filmmaker . But most who know him insist that he accepts and admires his friend 's success . His issues with Indy 4 may lie elsewhere : money ( was the risk to the franchise worth the potential reward ? ) and , most of all , control . Biographer Pollock points to the script as the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asks . " And who has veto power ? " When it comes to Indiana Jones , he says , Lucas is proprietary . Other than Star Wars , it 's all he has left as a moviemaker . " They 're his pictures , and he 's almost obsessive in his desire to control , " says Pollock . A longtime Lucas insider concedes that Lucas is indeed proprietary about Indiana Jones-and should be . " George has created this character , " he says . " It 's been George 's role in the triumvirate to be the driving force on the story and script . " This source adds that it 's unfair to cast Lucas as greedy . " He did Young Indiana Jones , " he says . " He was trying to use this beloved character to teach kids about history . He worked quite a number of years on a project that did n't make him much money . " This source also insists that Hollywood likes to accuse Lucas of greed because he got out of town and escaped-in every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off in L. A. , " he says . But he insists that Lucas should be thanked and not reviled . The reason that Indy 4 has n't happened , he says , is because none of the big players want to sell out the franchise . " Here are three people who want to do something that 's really worthy , " he says . " The story is that people are choosing to get it right . Mission : Impossible 2-they did n't even have a script and they started shooting ! That 's Hollywood . This is un-Hollywood . " If it does n't work out , Spielberg will survive the disappointment . " He liked the idea of it , but I do n't think he was in love with doing it , " says a fellow DreamWorker . He 's done with The Terminal with Tom Hanks , and he 's working on The War of the Worlds with Tom Cruise , among many other projects . Spielberg 's instincts may falter on occasion , but he is still the biggest gorilla in town . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At this point , the official story is that the project is not dead and that Lucas will come up with a storyline himself . Many in Hollywood are skeptical that it will ever happen . As for Paramount , it can console itself with a 50 percent share in Spielberg 's The War of the Worlds-assuming , of course , that the director and Cruise can come up with a script that they like . <p>
