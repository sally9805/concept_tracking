MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL 'S Headnote After 36 years on ABC , prime time 's second-longest-running show gets traded to cable . Here , a look back at the agony and the ecstasy . // 1 Many players have gotten their big break playing on Monday Night Football , but no break was as big-or as gruesome-as Redskins quarterback Joe Theismann 's right leg . " That 's the shot everyone remembers , " says MNF analyst John Madden , " where Lawrence Taylor hits him . You knew immediately that that was it for Joe Theismann . " And it was-the QB never played again . But for all those who miraculously did not vomit the first time while watching Theismann 's bone snap and protrude out of his skin , ABC was kind enough to replay the image approximately ... oh , 837 times . Still , there is one person who to this day has never seen the play-Theismann himself . " I have no desire to look at it , " says the victim ( who , ironically enough , will be announcing MNF games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . " NOV. 18 , 1985 2 What started off as unintentionally hilarious ( Terrell Owens saying selfless things like " Donovan needs me " and " All of Philadelphia is counting on me " ) turned downright scandalous when Nicollette Sheridan dropped her towel to reveal nothing-and everything-in a racy pregame skit . " It was in poor taste , " says Theismann . " Especially on the heels of the Janet Jackson situation at the Super Bowl . Something like that has its place-on Desperate Housewives . " NOV. 15 , 2004 3 Controversial announcer ( and civil rights activist ) Howard Cosell ignited protest after calling Redskins wideout Alvin Garrett a " little monkey . " Cosell quit before the next season . SEPT. 5 , 1983 4 " An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City . " It fell to Cosell , during a Patriots-Dolphins game , to break the news to much of America that John Lennon had been killed . " There were n't all the other news sources then , " says Madden of the early- ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game now and that happened , they 'd get the news from 100 other places as well . " DEC. 8 , 1980 5 After being paralyzed in a 1978 preseason game , Patriots wideout Darryl Stingley made an emotional return to Schaeffer Stadium for the 1979 opener against the Steelers , where he received a standing ovation from both players and fans . SEPT. 3 , 1979 6 It remains the most anticipated and watched ( by about 70 million people ) Monday Night Football game ever : the 12-0 Chicago Bears taking on Dan Marino and the only franchise ever to boast a perfect season-the Miami Dolphins . " I did n't think anybody could beat the Bears , " says Madden . " That 's the most dominant defense that I 've ever seen . " But with several members of the undefeated 1972 Dolphins team in attendance , Marino shredded Chicago for a 38-24 victory . For the Bears , the loss still proved only half as embarrassing as " The Super Bowl Shuffle . " DEC. 2 , 1985 7 Many people associate Monday Night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the announcers ' booth . While broadcasting a 1970 Eagles-Giants game , Cosell was slurring his words before disappearing in the second quarter . ( " I heard he took a taxi from Philadelphia all the way home to New York , " says Madden . ) Legend has it that martinis sent over by the Eagles owner did him in , leading Cosell to vomit on colleague Don Meredith 's cowboy boots . Cosell later blamed his demeanor on the effects of " a virulent virus . " NOV. 23 , 1970 8 After scoring his second TD against the Seahawks , 49er Terrell Owens autographed the football with a Sharpie retrieved from his sock , ushering in a new era of elaborate touchdown celebrations . " First it was a Sharpie , and then it was a cell phone , " says Madden . " And if you keep letting them go , it 's gon na be a refrigerator or something . " OCT. 14 , 2002 9 Packers quarterback Brett Favre has played through pain before , but nothing-close to what he experienced against the Raiders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of a heart attack , Favre threw for 399 yards and four touchdowns in a 41-7 blowout . " Anything that he threw up , his receivers were going to catch , " says Madden . " It did n't make any difference if it was single coverage , double coverage , triple coverage-the guys around him just felt , If he can get out there in this situation , we 're not gon na let anyone else get that ball . " " We did n't witness a football game that night , " says Theismann . " We witnessed a man overcoming incredible personal odds to be at his best . That whole game transcended football . " DEC. 22 , 2003 10 Seeking bigger ratings and buzz , ABC tapped comedian Dennis Miller to join the announcers ' booth . The experiment lasted two seasons . " When people watch football , they do n't want to look up words to figure out what they mean , " says Theismann . " Our game is about guys running into one another .
