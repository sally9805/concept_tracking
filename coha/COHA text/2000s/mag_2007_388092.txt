. Of Houses and Homes " What 's Your House Really Worth ? " ( Feb. 19 ) , about real estate website Zillow.com , prompted many letters from real estate agents who doubted the efficacy of its services . GREG HAMILTON JR . of St. Croix , U.S. Virgin Islands , pointed out , " Writer Jeff O'Brien 's home , to him , is worth $1,000,000 . He is emotionally connected to that price . Real estate brokers sell " houses , " sellers sell and buyers buy " homes . " That 's why brokers are necessary . We are n't emotionally involved . We can tell a seller that even though other homes in his area have sold for $1,000,000 , his will not , and why . " Agent MAUREEN MEGOWAN of Palos Verdes Estates , Calif. , said that in pricing a house , " the limited public information available " ca n't compete with the knowledge base of " an experienced real estate agent or appraiser taking all factors into consideration , " such as " has it been remodeled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street appeal , etc . " HOLGER STENBERG of Haverford , Pa. , a member of the National Association of Realtors , cautioned , " All real estate professionals are not Realtors . We have a specific code of ethics , " as well as , he says , superior training and experience . And some readers simply applauded the efforts of writer Jeff O'Brien and others to bypass " business as usual . " Congratulations on a fine article . There is a reason that companies like Zillow cause a disruption . Simply put , there 's way too many real estate agents out there who are not professional . Buyers and sellers are desperate to find a way around them . The current business model of " broker take all " allows brokers to hire new agents as " independent contractors , " at little if any cost . The broker knows that every new agent , experienced or not , will bring in an average of three deals before leaving for greener pastures . Too many agents , not enough good ones . RICHARD NEWQUISTReal Estate Sales Agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet on " How to Buy an HDTV " ( First , Feb. 19 ) . It was brief , informative , and for someone who remains technologically challenged , a big help on my next purchase . I 've been Googling for weeks ; your article finally gave me exactly what I needed . DAN WHITEFayetteville , Ark . Cheers for Tyler Perry " Diary of a Mad Businessman " ( Feb. 19 ) was a great piece . You captured the businessman today , his background , the methods that made him a success , and his plans and hopes for business tomorrow . I 'm an African-American partner in a law firm and a graduate of Harvard Business School . I subscribe to FORTUNE and several other business and news magazines , and I teach a course in ethical decision-making at San Diego State University . I know how to evaluate a piece of business writing . Writer Nadira Hira achieved a rare standard of excellence . Well done . DAN EATONSan Diego I THOROUGHLY ENJOYED reading about Tyler Perry 's challenges and successes . As a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thesis in personal financial planning , I do n't relate to or identify with the " chitlin " circuit " that troubles some in Perry 's culture . But I can relate to and enjoy his ownership of his work and the way he 's breaking new ground in working ( or not ) with Hollywood studios . I look forward to hearing more about this man  --  and learning from him too . GREGORY JACKSONCastle Rock , Colo . Lessons for Collins jim collins 's reply to Jeff Sonnenfeld 's excellent question  --  Do you think we should also focus on the wisdom from failure ?  --  missed the point ( " Questions for Jim Collins , " Feb. 19 ) . Collins answered with an analysis of what we can learn from company failure in order to avoid it . But the question was about something entirely different . When I was a kid playing hockey in Minnesota , I heard a coach say it was important to learn how to lose . The humility , discipline , and persistence that come from losing are every bit as valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collins could uncover some lessons there too . NOEL F. BENNETTBoulder Up With FORTUNE I 'VE READ MOST weekly and biweekly business magazines since I 've been out of college . Now I read only FORTUNE . The reason has never been better demonstrated than by two articles in the Feb. 19 issue , " He 's at the Head of the Class " ( First , " How I Work " ) and " Saving the World One Cup of Yogurt at a Time . " Other business journals make it seem there is nothing positive in the business world . FORTUNE always manages to include new ideas and features that I tear out and pass on to my associates . Thank you for the balance you bring to the world of business reporting . SERGE ZIMBEROFFSanta Rosa , Calif .
