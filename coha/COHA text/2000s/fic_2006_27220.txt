Exiles in America A Novel By Christopher Bram William Morrow Christopher Bram Zachary Knowles and Daniel Wexler had been together for twenty-one years . They did not describe themselves as " married . " Their generation distrusted the word . Zack was forty-eight , Daniel forty-seven . They lived in Williamsburg , Virginia , in a 1930s colonial brick house on Indian Springs Road , a quiet residential street near the College of William and Mary . Daniel taught studio classes in painting at the school . Zack was a psychiatrist , Dr. Zachary Knowles , with a small practice in town and an office at home , just off their living room . Nothing much ever happened in Williamsburg , and people at the college tended to become set in their routines . When an Iranian painter , Abbas Rohani , came to town to be artist in residence in September 2002 , nobody thought to invite him and his wife to dinner . Daniel persuaded Zack that they should have them over . " What if they do n't like homosexuals ? " said Zack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What if they hate Jews ? " Only Daniel was Jewish , born in Brooklyn and raised on Long Island . Zack was a native Virginian , a lapsed Methodist who had escaped to New York after med school to finish his training in the city of psychoanalysis . He had met Daniel in New York . They had moved south to Zack 's home turf tenyears ago , when Daniel took a teaching job at this small state college . Daniel left a message in Rohani 's voice mail inviting him and his wife to dinner . It was the wife who called back . " This is Elena Rohani . We shall be delighted to come . Do we need to bring anything ? Is it-how do you say ? - potluck ? " Daniel assured her that all they needed was their appetite . And so , late one afternoon early in September , the Friday before classes started , Daniel stood in the kitchen , slicing fresh tomatoes and squash from Zack 's garden to grill on the hibachi while he talked to their good friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a glass of red wine . The door was wide open-the weather remained warm and humid-and looked out on a narrow concrete terrace with an iron railing . A small wooded ravine sloped behind the house , its curtain of trees level with the railing . The last cicadas of the summer chirred in the leafy branches . Zack was at the other end of the house , seeing his last patient of the day . " An artist who paints paintings ? " asked Ross in his deep , leisurely drawl . " Is n't that kind of old-fashioned ? I thought you said painting was what the dinosaurs did . " " He 's Iranian . Maybe he does n't know any better , " said Daniel . " You joke , but you may have hit on something . He could be in a time warp . Fundamentalist Islam forbids graven images . Figurative painting could be very avant-garde . " Ross was a courtly Southerner of the old school , handsome and hetero , almost sixty , much married and much divorced . He owned and managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that showed foreign and independent films and occasional classics . Zack and Daniel were among his handful of regulars . Ross was a rare kind of straight man . He loved books , art , music , and old movies . He had served in Vietnam but broke the stereotypes there , too . He loved to travel-he 'd visited the Middle East twice . He might have been happy if he did n't fall in love with a new woman every five or six years . Currently between marriages , he seemed like the perfect extra guest for tonight . " What 're the paintings like ? " he asked . " Have you seen any ? " " I 've seen slides and a catalog from a show in Paris . They 're figurative , but in an abstract way . Like Picasso or Klee . But not pastiche . Kind of neo-Expressionist , like Francesco Clemente from a few years back . But I like his stuff . " Daniel liked it very much , in fact . " So it 's not ethnic or primitive ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's probably better trained than I am . " They could hear Zack out front , bidding goodbye to his patient , an elderly woman who responded with a deliberate , end-of-the-session cheerfulness . Daniel knew that chirpy tone all too well . " It must make you glad , " said Ross . " To have a real painter in town , someone you can talk shop with . " Daniel frowned . " Not really . I do n't especially like other artists . I just want to be friendly . I remember what it was like when we first came here and nobody gave us the time of day . " Daniel was n't entirely sure why he wanted to know the man . " It 's not like I 'm an artist myself anymore . I 'm a teacher now . Full-time . I do n't miss all that **44;522;TOOLONG macho bullshit . " There was a tread of shoes coming toward the kitchen , and a clack of toenails against the hardwood floor . A large black poodle with a pink tongue trotted into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with a pale beard and a starched blue shirt . " Hey there , Jock , " Ross sang out , crouching down to scratch the happy dog behind its ears . The poodle was n't trimmed like topiary but left woolly all over . " Hey there , Zack . How you doing ? " Zack only nodded , looking preoccupied , distant , sad . " Bad session ? " said Ross . " Who-what ? " Zack snapped his eyes open and saw Ross . " Oh , Ross . Sorry . No . Good session . Actually . Very good . Hi . " Zack was often like this after seeing a patient , spacey and distracted , still listening to the conversation in his head . He went over to Daniel and kissed him on the temple . " That 's right . We got company . Need any help ? " " No , dollface . We 're fine , " said Daniel . " Why do n't you pour yourself some wine ?
