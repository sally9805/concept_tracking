TH : Dr. Sampalis , at the beginning of this article we provide our audience with a profile of your professional background and achievements over the past 20 years . I would like to use this opportunity to concentrate on your significant innovative work in the fields of breast cancer diagnosis and surgical techniques as well as your commitment to introducing our industry to the health benefits of natural krill oil . First , please explain how you became aware of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . Dr. S : As a surgeon with a specialty in breast cancer I have always had a serious concern that conventional mammography is not an exact science . At best it is only 70 percent accurate in detecting tumors , especially in women with very dense breast tissue , women who have had prior breast surgeries , women with implants and those on hormone replacement therapy . I realized the potential of scintimammography as a fluke while completing my surgical training at the University Hospital at Athens . Upon preop workups , on female myocardium patients , findings ( black spots ) seen in their breasts were removed during surgery . When examined most were shown to be cancerous . The chief of surgery in my department allowed me to pursue this phenomena and suggested that if the results were promising , I could then develop it into a Ph.D . thesis . That is how scintimammography was born in Europe . Scintimammography is an extremely sensitive and specific procedure utilizing a cancer seeking dye to detect the presence of breast cancer . In comparison to conventional mammography , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ percent accurate as compared to the 70 percent accuracy of conventional mammography . Concurrent with my work , Dr. Iraj Khaikali , a nuclear medicine physician located in Florida , had also made the same observations . Today , scintimammography , being much more accurate than conventional mammography and less expensive and more readily available than a CAT scan , is gaining momentum in the U.S. Any hospital with a gamma scanner can perform the procedure . It is being approved by HMOs ; many hospitals are starting to offer it and it is being requested by more doctors . However , at this point there has been very little public awareness generated . A reader interested in more information regarding scintimammography can visit Web site : www.miraluma.com The microinvasive and stereotactic surgical techniques really emanated from a personal commitment to explore new and innovative approaches to reducing the physical and emotional trauma associated with conventional breast cancer surgery . The majority of breast cancer surgeries today are debilitating for women . This is because in most instances it entails removing all or a major portion of the breast . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They do n't deserve it . Accordingly we are always seeking the means to offer the best treatment to women but with minimal scarring , both physical and emotional . The technique which we have designed allows a tumor of up to two centimeters to be removed using digital technology and robotics . Whether it is cancerous or not , as long as the tumor is in its very early stages we can remove the entire tumor with a minimal amount of surrounding tissue , through a microinvasivc incision and with practically no scarring . I am firmly convinced broad implementation of early detection through scintimammography and the extraction of cancerous breast tumors by stereotactic surgical techniques could benefit millions of women who otherwise will be destined to undergo the trauma of radical breast surgery and mastectomies . TH : I am curious , after nearly 20 years of medical training , research , surgery and innovating new diagnostic approaches and surgical procedurcs , you made a paradigm shift to the natural health arena . Dr. S : In 2000 , when I was working on my stereotactic technology , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was acquired by a larger company . The new entity had no provision for research grants and my funding ceased . Consequently , I approached a venture capital group regarding funding . My particular objectives did not fit with their business interests , however , the firm 's president , Mr. Henri Harland , reviewed my qualifications and offered me the opportunity to become involved in research on krill , a crustacean that lives in the ocean , specifically krill from the Antarctic Ocean . They were interested in developing a procedure to extract its beneficial oils for human consumption . While conducting the initial research I became intrigued with the potential benefits of krill to human health . In comparing it to other nutritional ingredients I realized it was the first time one oil was a combination of virtually all of the elements the human body needs to function properly . There are functional phosphohpids rich in omega-3 , an imperative to the development of the brain in the fetus and critical to function of our brain throughout life . It is the substance every cell needs to maintain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is effective for the regulation of blood glucose and lipids . When Mr. Harland reviewed my research , he offered me an opportunity to become vice president of research and development of Neptune Technologies &; Bioressources Inc. , a new company formed to pursue the natural health of krill and other natural mafine biomass . Even though it was completely out of my field of research , I was convinced that krill was nature 's prefect recipe and there was no way I was going to turn down the opportunity to follow through on verifying a multitude of benefits and help to bring it to the health food and health care professional markets . TH : So basically you made the transition from being involved in the hands-on curing of disease to becoming immersed in the development of an ingredient that promotes wellness in the body and protects against disease ? Dr. S : Immersed , yes . However , I have n't discontinued my research . I am still involved one day a week as an assistant professor of experimental surgery at the University of Montreal . But I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the laboratory bench to the bedside , from the Antarctic Ocean to the people . TH : I understand your company has recently received some exciting results regarding the use of krill oil in managing PMS symptoms . Dr. S : Yes . Statistics show that 80 percent of lost work days among women of reproductive age are caused by the effects of premenstrual syndrome . Results of the study show that krill oil was proven to help manage and control the physical and emotional symptoms . The study was validated by the American Psychiatric Association . If you consider the fact that antianxiety drugs and antideprcssants are now regularly being given to women in order to control the emotional symptoms of PMS , an effective natural and safe approach should be a warmly welcomed alternative . A second clinical study performed on NKO proved that NKO is significantly more effective than fish oil for the regulation of blood glucose and lipids within healthy ranges . It is now safe to suggest that NKO is scientifically proven to be a safe , incredibly stable and significantly effective dietary marine supplement without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marine ( fish ) oils in the market . I would like also to emphasize the incredible increase of mental alertness , concentration and memory reported by everybody taking NKO . This is due to the high concentration of omega-3 rich functional phospholipids combined with extraordinarily potent antioxidants . We are all very grateful to Mr. Henri Harland , who first believed in the virtues of krill and devoted the resources to bring it up to this point . TH : Any further comments ? Dr. S : I would like to say that what I am doing is not at all unique . More and more medical doctors and conventional medical scientists are researching the multiple health benefits of nutrition and nutrient supplementation on humans . A good example is a clinical study performed by the world renowned Montreal Heart Institute Research Center on NKO . TH : Dr. Sampalis thank you for your time . I 'm sure the readers will enjoy learning about you and your endeavors . Dr. S : You are welcome .
