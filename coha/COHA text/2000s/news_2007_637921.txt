<p> Marcelo Garza y Garza , the top state police investigator in Nuevo Leon , walked out of a church in an upscale neighborhood in Monterrey to take a cellphone call last September , when two bullets struck the back of his head . <p> The shots came from a semiautomatic pistol that did precisely what its colloquial name - matapolicia , or " police killer " - suggests . Mr. Garza y Garza died immediately . <p> " Police killers , " so named because they were created to penetrate bulletproof vests , are among the newest weapons streaming into Mexico from the United States . Some 200 seized in Mexico last year - including the one used in the Garza murder - had been purchased in the US , and many more are in circulation , say authorities . <p> These guns , though , are a fraction of the high-powered weaponry purchased legally or illegally in stores and at gun shows in Texas , Arizona , and California and smuggled by the thousands into Mexico . Moreover , the demand for combat-style guns is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth to compete for control of trade routes into the US and , more recently , to resist a massive military crackdown that began when President Felipe Calderon took office in December . <p> In some ways this is an old border story . <p> Drugs have always gone north . Guns go south . But as Mexico 's drug wars spiral so violently out of control that beheadings are tallied in local papers , the Calderon administration is demanding that the US do more to stanch the gun smuggling and to amend gun laws that , it says , are interfering with Mexico 's fight to disarm organized crime . <p> " There is a contradiction , " says a Mexican senior official speaking on condition of anonymity . " The US says they are so worried about drug trafficking , but the US is the one arming the drug traffickers . " <p> Amid violence that has even spilled onto American soil , the US government is answering the call . US-Mexico cooperation on the matter , say many involved in the effort , has reached an unprecedented level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extraditions , and the establishment of joint task forces . <p> Still , US Attorney General Alberto Gonzales acknowledged in June , at a meeting of his counterparts in Mexico and Central America , that the US could do more to stem the deadly flow of illegal guns across the border . <p> " That is something being discussed at the highest levels , particularly given that the Calderon administration has demonstrated to be very bold " against drug traffickers , says Armand Peschard-Sverdrup , director of the Mexico Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) , a Washington research organization . <p> A death toll of 1,400 this year <p> The stakes for Mexico are high - and getting higher . At least 1,400 people here have been killed in drug-related violence since January , and the tally has been rising for three years running . The arrests of high-level leaders of the Tijuana , Gulf , and Juarez cartels , during former President Vicente Fox 's term , have led to a power struggle as organizations splintered and are now jostling for control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can get a reading on the street situation from the kinds of guns being used and confiscated . In the 1980s , they saw mostly handguns , drug traffickers ' weapon of choice . Now narcotraffickers are arming themselves , literally , for war . <p> Grenades have been hurled into newspaper offices and local police stations . Guns like the one that killed Garza y Garza in Monterrey are increasingly being turned on police , judges , and journalists . The notorious May shootout that killed nearly two dozen in the town of Cananea , 35 miles south of the border with Arizona , had a clear-cut connection with cross-border weapons smuggling : Of the 23 guns that were recovered , about three-quarters were found to have been purchased in Texas and the rest in Arizona and California , say US authorities . <p> That comes as no surprise to Mexican officials : Of all the confiscated firearms that are run through traces in Mexico - some 5,000 to 10,000 annually - more than 90 percent are first purchased in the US , they say . <p> Guns are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizens who want arms for self-protection or to hunt must present petitions to the Defense Department , undergo extensive background checks , and buy their weapons - all of them relatively low-caliber - from the institution itself , says Raul Benitez , a security expert at the Center for North American Studies at the National Autonomous University of Mexico . There are no gun stores . After a gun is legally purchased , it can not be moved . Owners must keep them at home . <p> Some weapons seized from drug traffickers , such as grenades , are stolen from the Mexican military . But drug traffickers have little interest in weapons carried by the military , because they are of lower caliber than the semiautomatic weapons from the US , says Martin Gabriel Barron , a researcher at the National Criminal Sciences Institute in Mexico City . The semiautomatics are then often modified to fire like machine guns . <p> Most guns cross into Mexico via " ant traffic , " three to five weapons at a time , stashed under car seats . Once over the border , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ US , says Mr. Benitez . There are plenty of buyers - kidnappers , thieves , people who simply want a gun without enduring the red tape to do it legally - but many contraband guns end up in the hands of drug traffickers . The only people who can afford matapolicias , at about $1,200 a pop , are the narcotraffickers , says a US official who asked to remain anonymous because he works in counterarms investigations . <p> US responds to Mexican pressure <p> Mexican presidents have long complained of US policies that they say make it difficult to cut off the weapons trade , but the Calderon government has been the most vocal critic , many say . In June , Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora called US policies on guns " absurd . " <p> " The Mexican government has been applying a lot of pressure on the US government , " says Mr. Peschard-Sverdrup of CSIS . <p> As a result , cooperation is reaching new levels . The US Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives ( ATF ) is training Mexican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weapons to the US via a technology called E-trace , and is developing a version in Spanish that will leave less room for error . The US has donated dogs that can detect 19,000 types of explosive power . The ATF intends to provide X-ray scanning equipment for beefed-up inspection of vehicles entering Mexico from the US . Both countries are working toward sharing information in real time about organized-crime investigations . <p> Some worry , though , that Mexico is becoming too dependent on the US to correct the gunrunning problem and its related ills , instead of focusing on its own weaknesses . Mexico 's decision in January to extradite 15 suspected drug-cartel leaders to the US is a case in point , says Erubiel Tirado , a security expert at the Iberoamerican University in Mexico City . " It is an implicit recognition of the big failure of the whole prosecuting system to control the phenomenon , " he says . " We decided to give up the effort and send the main cartels to the US . " <p> In some matters , US ca n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorstep , say many experts in Mexico . " There is less control along Mexico 's southern border and more routes , " says Eduardo Valle , a former assistant to the attorney general in the early 1990s . " This is the part that no one talks about . " Even if 90 percent of the guns that end up in Mexico originate from the US , a share of those weapons arrive via Central and South America - some of them brought in by big-time arms dealers , he says . <p> Corruption by Mexican officials , too , remains a problem . A recent report by the legislature 's National Defense Commission blamed customs for the illegal flow of arms into Mexico . The chief of Mexico 's Customs Department , Juan Jose Bravo , declined repeated interview requests through a spokesman . But in a press conference in early July he said the department would be unveiling new plans to modernize customs and help prevent gun smuggling . <p> " The basic issue is that guns are sold legally on the US side , " says Cuauhtemoc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The corruption in customs , and the incapacity of the Mexican state to control it , allows them right through . " <p> Taming the violence , the guns , and the cartels requires reforming Mexico 's institutions , analysts say . " There is no organized crime without the complicity of state structures , at any level , at any position , " says Mr. Tirado , the security expert . " Because of corruption and weakened institutions , because of lack of professionalization in police structures ... now we have the Mexican Army on the streets . " <p> In the short term , cooperation with the US is the most promising strategy , many say . Still , there 's much room for progress . Only a small portion of firearms recovered in Mexico is traced , though that number is increasing each year , says William Hoover , ATF assistant director for field operations , who headed an ATF delegation to Mexico recently . Even when Mexico runs a trace on a gun , says another ATF official , the process is only successful about 40 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two agents stationed permanently in Mexico , even as the presence of other organizations such as the US Drug Enforcement Agency has grown . <p> For all the kinks yet to be worked out , the symbiosis between the two nations is heartening to those working in the field . <p> " The bilateral cooperation between the US and Mexico has never been better , " says J.J. Ballesteros , the ATF Southwest Border Program manager in Texas for gun trafficking into Mexico . " They came and opened up their investigative files , which prompted us to do the same . We saw positive results ... and with each positive result this inspires more and more cooperation . " <p> * Friday : View from the US . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2007 . The Christian Science Monitor
