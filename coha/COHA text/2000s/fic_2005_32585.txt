HERE COMES THE BRIDE The light hum of the cello set the mood for the joyous day . A wedding . Venus Johnston , do you take this man as your awfully wedded husband ? Lawful , not awful , as she 'd always thought the preacher was saying during TV ceremonies when she was a little girl . Yes ! Yes , finally she would get her chance . Lawfully wedded bliss . Clint smiled , but showed no teeth . His lips delicately turned up , a smirk . A grimace ? No . He was truly in love and about to make Venus the happiest woman alive . Her man . Sexy . Successful . Fine . All three characteristics a girl could only fantasize about . But for Venus it was now a reality . " If there is anyone who knows of a reason why this union should not take place , let them speak now . . . " Venus hated this part . When the nightmare began . The most dreaded moment when the woman actually stands up and says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Venus knows the voice . It 's played in her head a thousand times . She turned around slowly to see the gorgeous actress , Vivica Fox , a picture of beauty in a stunning flowing wedding dress . A glorious shimmering diamond hung around her neck , almost blinding the guests . Clint loved Vivica , that 's what he always used to say . But she could never be a real threat because she was only in the pages of glossy magazines and in Hollywood movies . Yet , here she was , extending her elegantly gloved hand to Clint . " Come along , dear . You 've played outside long enough . You know you need a real woman , someone who 's going to love you and take care of you and put you first at all times . Tell her , sweetie . It 's time for her to let you go . How many times must we go through this ? " Vivica 's voice echoed off thechurch walls . " Please no . . . not again . " Venus could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud . Her panic was rising . Boy , it 's getting hot in here . The music switched abruptly . She looked over where the cellist was replaced by a hip-hopper with a bandanna and a gold tooth . It 's getting hot in here . . . so take off all your clothes . " Shut up , shut up . " She felt Clint release her hand and start toward Vivica Fox . " Wait , no ! " Venus grabbed his sleeve . He shook her off and began walking again . " Somebody stop him ! " Venus screamed . " Clint , she 's no good for you . Ca n't you see through all that Maybelline . . . it 's not real , ca n't you see that she 's fake ? She 's not real . " Clint put up his hand , " It 's too late , " he said with ease . " You had your chance and you blew it . " He turned and slipped his hand into Vivica 's glove-covered one . They began to walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ball . Venus hiked up her wedding gown and chased them outside . " Clint ! " she screamed . She turned and watched Vivica and Clint climb into a shiny white Range Rover with a bunch of cans tied to the back and the words Just Married ! But Not to Venus spray-painted all over . " NOOO , not again ! " she tried to scream , but the words smothered her , making her struggle for air . " Hey , you all right ? " She snapped out it and found herself staring into Airic 's face , concern and panic written all over him . The rest of the wedding party stared at her with confusion . She was confused too , standing next to Airic with the scent of gardenias and star gazer lilies fragrant in the air , listening to the light hum of the cello . The sun was high above their heads and the breeze was gentle enough to keep a nervous bride cool . Was n't it perfect ? What wedding is n't ? Regardless of the amount of money spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bride all that mattered was walking down the aisle seeing the light in her future husband 's eyes . The small details , like her satin heels sinking into the grass , the cake arriving slanted , or the ice statue of cupid 's bow melting into a dripping phallic symbol , or the mother of the bride chanting , " Thank you , Lord , " were inconsequential on this monumental day . Getting to the altar , hearing that last " I do , " and the crowd cheering as if a touch down had been scored . . . that 's what it was all about . Venus , the maid of honor , and Airic , a groom 's man by default , were the only ones not clapping or throwing rose petals when the minister announced , " You may kiss the bride . " They ignored the organ pressing out the cue for them to fall into procession with the rest of the wedding party . Instead , they remained standing opposite one another , Airic pulling at the black satin noose around his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underneath the small bridesmaid bouquet she held , unable to shake the nightmare that had haunted her like a black cloud for the last two years . Each and every time she went to some else 's wedding , she felt cursed . And the conversation she and Airic had on the way to the ceremony had n't helped matters . Riding along the edge of the Occoquan River in the northern valley of Virginia , they 'd traveled quietly most of the way . Swaying green grass surrounded the tall stretch of trees for miles along the highway . Venus kept her attention on the serene view , trying to remain calm . " . . . all I 'm saying is that we 're not getting any younger . By the time I finally get to walk down the aisle , I 'm going to need a cane . " " Why is it my fault ? " Airic responded without a pause . " How many times have I told you , name the time , name the place , I 'm there . I think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one hand while his slender fingers pushed relentlessly on the tuning , unable to get a radio station to come in clearly . He shut it off , giving her his complete attention . " Name the date , " he said almost as a dare , cutting his eyes in Venus 's direction . " What 's wrong ? Calendar a little tied up ? " Her frustration came out in a completely opposite form , putting her hand over her mouth to stifle the laughter . Airic gripped the steering wheel until his pale knuckles lost color in his already fair skin . " I 'm serious . Name the date . " " Sure , I 'll name a date and then the week before the ceremony , you 'll say , ' Oh , I thought you were talking about 2002 . You meant April of this year . ' " Venus deepened her voice to mock his . ' Can you reschedule , dear ? ' The sun beamed relentlessly on the passenger 's side . She was hot . She was irritable , and not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the zipper stopped . Her hair was so tightly pulled back from her face to create a bun effect that her eyes hurt . One more of the bride 's many requests , including the heavy layer of fake pearls that felt like a knotted rope around her neck . She tried to adjust the cheap necklace and snagged a wispy strand of hair that was too short to stay put . " Shit . " " Name the date , Venus ! " Airic thought the expletive was directed toward him . " No . . . it's --  " " Name the date , " he demanded again , his graying temples creasing at the sides , the skin tightening around his eyes . " Right , pencil me in for June first of 3003 . " Venus responded with as much sarcasm as possible , no longer just pissed at the uncomfortable dress , the snagged hair , or the necklace choking her . Airic 's foot pushed harder on the gas , speeding into the opposite lane to pass a small white Jetta . Venus always checked when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalized license plate that read , BABYDOC . Of course by now Clint would have moved up in the world , driving something a bit more sophisticated , but she always checked . Always . " See what I 'm saying ? Happens every time I tell you to pick a date . This is what I get , silence . " " Right . " It came out louder than planned . Venus gave the hair and metal clasp one last chance to part on friendly terms , then gave it a tug , unafraid of the consequences . " Sure , Airic . . . whatever . " She was tired of replaying the conversation in her head . Setting a date . Tired of picturing herself in another white gown like the one worn by the bride , with the splendid train that flowed effortlessly up the aisle . Tired of the whole business . How she 'd managed to be standing witness to yet another ceremony was beyond her . She 'd only met the bride , Felicia Meadows , a year and a half ago when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talk much during their interview and only answered questions when she was asked . She 'd kept her hands folded on her lap without one fidgeting episode , a sure sign of diligence and focus . At the time Felicia had n't even a boyfriend , no prospects for the future . Simply moved to the northern Virginia area fresh out of college without a plan , without a strategy , determined to get away from her southern roots in Memphis . Now she was married to Joseph , a friendly financial analyst who insisted on coming all the way up to the tenth floor to pick her up for lunch instead of waiting downstairs in the no parking zone . With forced steps , Venus moved closer to Airic . They were standing on the very spot where the Felicia and Joseph had just taken their vows underneath a flowered trellis with streams of ivy . " I 'm sorry . " Still holding on to the compact flower arrangement , Venus stretched to reach around his lean shoulders . The white ribbons cascaded down the back of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Her soft brown eyes smiled out of duty . Always her last words . . . no rush . She was only thirty-six . Considered an old maid at one time , but not now . Statistics showed she was right on schedule to give birth to her first child in her first marriage at nearly forty . Plenty of time , no rush . " Let 's get out of here . " She kissed Airic on his narrow chin , inhaling his scent . He kissed her back , whispering near her ear , " That 's the best idea I 've heard yet . " He swayed her gently back and forth . " One day left to get all the good loving I can . " His jaw line creased deeply with a smile . It was true . By Monday morning there would be two thousand miles between them . Working in opposite corners of the country , she in Los Angeles and he in Washington , D.C. A few months earlier , when Ron Chadnum had invited her to lunch and placed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice before grabbing it and declaring herself the winner . She rode home singing along with Mary J. Blige at the top of her lungs . " Like sweet morning dew . . . I took one look at you . . . you were my destiny . " Only thing , she was n't singing about Airic . Her destiny and sweet morning dew was the new account . Fashion had always been her first love and finally she 'd be in the center of it with the JPWear clothing . She 'd prepared a list of reasons why it was a good move , spending time with her parents in Los Angeles , enhancing her career , and opening the door for other opportunities . Turned out , none of the excuses were necessary . Over dinner she 'd told Airic of the offer -- the offer , not the acceptance . " Will you take it ? Sounds like an incredible opportunity , " he 'd said , a little too excited for her taste . " It is , but what about us ? " Venus had asked cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle . " Us is solid as a rock , two thousand miles ca n't put a dent in us . " Airic had made it sound so simple . Part of her wanted him to throw drama , plead for her to stay , maybe even pout a little . What would it hurt to show that he cared , needed her ? He did n't always have to be so understanding , so mature . But tomorrow was the big day . It came quick and painless . She was already packed , already had an apartment , and Airic was already used to the idea of her being gone . She felt a warm surge of anticipation for the night to come . A send-off like no other . Going-away sex was the best kind . They 'd have to go at least three rounds to hold them over until they saw each other again . Airic scooped her up effortlessly like she was being carried over the threshold . Venus called out to her best friend who was wearing the exact same shimmering silver brides maid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt like a foil-wrapped chocolate bar . " Wendy , catch ! " She threw the small bouquet and blew a kiss . Wendy caught the bouquet and now held two , shaking them in front of her like pompoms . Her rich brown skin gleamed against the shiny gown . " Call me when you get settled in L.A. I 'll keep an eye on your man for you , do n't worry . " Venus grinned revealing a set of just-whitened teeth , feeling light in Airic 's arms . " This man does n't need watching , he 's in love . " She kicked her leg out as she was being whisked out of the wedding garden past the idle crowd of well-wishers . For the moment , she felt like she was the bride . She blew kisses to no one in particular while Airic carted her off . She snuggled into the sweet , heavy scent of his cologne . No rush , she thought . Her day would come .               @ @ @ @ @ @
