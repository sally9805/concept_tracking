GROUND CONTROL TO MAJOR TOM This stylish unit is a satellite radio receiver from Sony  --  the first of its kind . Starting this summer , two companies , XM Satellite Radio and Sirius Satellite Radio ( Sony 's device works with the former ) , will start broadcasting radio signals from space . The good news ? You 'll never drive out of range of your favorite station . The bad news ? The service will cost about $10 a month . <P> A DREAMCAST DEFERRED In the latest war of the game consoles , first blood has been drawn . Last week a Japanese newspaper reported that Sega would cease production of its popular Dreamcast console in March . Sega has refused to confirm the report , insisting on its " global commitment to Dreamcast , " but if true , the news would come as a bitter disappointment to the approximately 3 million U.S. gamers who bought a Dreamcast . Either way , Sega will continue to publish software for Dreamcast . It 's tough all over : Sony 's game division , makers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in 2000 . <P> FREEZE FRAME Regardless of who won or lost last weekend , they looked cool doing it , thanks to a technology called Eye Vision that made its debut at the Super Bowl . Thirty cameras set up in the stands tracked the action , recorded it digitally , then combined it on the fly to form a single tableau . Result : CBS could freeze the action mid-play and then rotate it , Matrix-style , in three dimensions . Eighteen months in the making , Eye Vision may be headed for the Final Four . If only quarterbacks could dodge linebackers like Keanu . <P>  --  By Lev Grossman
