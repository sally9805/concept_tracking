WHEN MOLLY , OUR ROMANCE SPECIALIST , first suggested we sponsor a " Why Do Fools Fall In Love ? " promotion , we figured she 'd been into the Grand Marnier again . We worried that such a contest  --  which asked readers to share their stories of meeting through our personal ads-would never be taken seriously by a readership as sophisticated as ours . <p> But a spirit of innovation has always driven Triad Style , from memorable theme issues ( " Cheese Fiesta , " May ' 97 ; " The Unbearable Lightness of Tulle , " August ' 99 ) to daring reader polls ( " How Low Will You Go ? " July 2000 ) . And so , disregarding past legal entanglements ( " Potentially Deadly Resolutions , " January 2001 ) , we decided to give the idea a try . <p> Good golly , was Miss Molly ever right ! We were flooded with responses , some as simple as a sentence , others as elaborate as full-scale anatomical models . ( Note to Jerry K. of High Point : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The volume made judging an awesome task . In the end , though , one entry rose above the rest . From Cupid 's sting to the tingly rush of first-date hormones to the forging of a lifelong union , the story of Tim and Tiffany Tiles has it all . Hope , suspense , chivalry , swoons . In short , romance . <p> As grand-prize winners , the Tiles will receive a valuable gift certificate to the Nut Tree Shopping Plaza , including a romantic dinner for two at the Gondola . <p> Without further ado , their story . <p> Tiff : In April 1999 , friends of mine placed an ad in Triad Style for my birthday . When I first found out , I did n't know what to think , because my impression of personals was that they meant you had no hope for love and this was your last resort . Then I thought : What the heckl <p> Tim : I was n't having the best of luck with the dating scene . I 'd been to all the clubs : Daddio 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw Style . I flipped through it and noticed the personals . They were in the back . <p> Tiff : I had wonderful response to my ad , which rhymed , almost like a poem . I answered every letter and went out with maybe a dozen guys . I met every type you can think about , from nice and funny to snobbish ones . Alas , none were " it . " <p> Tim : Nothing was working out , and my friends were starting to tease me . My one friend Chip called me Spock all the time , because he said Spock never got to mate , either . Then around April 1999 I picked up Style , and something about this one ad struck my eye . I do n't remember exactly what , but I answered that one ad . <p> Tiff : Tim was one of the gentlemen who responded by letter , and I spoke to him on the phone . We planned to meet at a restaurant . But for some reason we never got together . <p> Tim : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was real high , kind of like one of those Chipmunk brothers . You know those cartoons ? And her phone did n't work too well . There was this hum in the background , like someone humming . <p> Tiff : I kept going out with people , but once I met them in person I knew it would n't work . One guy wanted to fly me to Vegas on my credit card . Another asked me to mail a package for him . It was always something like that . <p> Tim : I met someone through a friend . We dated almost a year , and then she suddenly left town . I reported her disappearance to the police , but they could n't find her either . So that sort of did it for me with being set up by friends . <p> Tiff : For a while there I dated a guy who had one real arm and one plastic . He 'd been a volleyball player , but when I met him he was a security guard . I think he was a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my life got back to normal . Tim : Somewhere around fall , I started looking through Style again . There was a thing where it said it was free , so I placed an ad . I talked to all the girls who responded . I had a pretty good time with one . But she got engaged to her minister . Long story short : it did n't work out . <p> Tiff : The following January , I was sitting around with friends when I decided I was tired of not having any fun . So I picked up Style and decided I would answer several personals . See , that way I could choose . Tim : One letter sounded awfully familiar . I started reading it , and , then I saw the name . It was at the bottom of the letter , right where you sign : Tiff . So I called her , and we talked a few times , but not for very long . I was working the swing shift as a quality inspector at Hanes . That did n't help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was calling , I was working a lot on my job . We get a lot of orders in January . He kept telling me we had spoken before , and each time I would laugh and tell him he was crazy . <p> Tim : I tried to convince her . She did n't believe me . <p> Tiff : Finally , one day he called and started listing off facts I 'd told him almost a year before . ( He even knew about my kidney operation ! ) I was amazed and scared that this person I did n't know knew so much about me . It was like something from X-Files . Starting that day , we talked every day for many , many hours . <p> Tim : We were having two- or three-hour phone calls . She 'd gotten a new phone by then . <p> Tiff : Tim could n't hear that well . He said it was because of all the machines at work . I had to talk real loud , and my roommate was like , " Are you dating a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was when I realized Tim might be partially deaf . <p> Tim : When I would talk to Tiff there 'd be this buzzing . Even with the new phone . At first I thought it was my middle ear acting up . But now I think it was the Lord 's way of telling me : Tim , this is the one . <p> Tiff : During our conversations , I felt more and more attracted to Tim ; in fact , I felt it was too good to be true . <p> Tim : We were almost afraid to meet , thinking we might be let down . We would make arrangements , but one time I would cancel and the next time Tiff would cancel . This went on from about February 3 iint ; l Anyi 95. 9000 <p> Tiff : Tim took me to a boat show . He did n't have a boat , but he had some friends who had one . Right before he dropped me off , he kissed me goodnight . He was very much the gentleman . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sight . There was something extraspecial about her . It 's hard to explain . <p> Tiff : The second date Tim brought me a flower . It was a rose , only without thorns . He had to pay extra for that . We started dating regularly and fell head over heels in love . <p> Tim : We had all these nicknames for each other . Honey . Sweetmeat . There were some others I forget ... Yams . That was another one . <p> Tiff : We did all kinds of things , from shopping to just watching TV . Tim : We could get pretty crazy , if you know what I mean . <p> Tiff : Tim likes to do strange things sometimes . Not strange so much as weird . But when I would say something , he 'd just smile and say , " To each his own . " I 'd never thought about it that way . <p> Tim : We took it slow . It took a long time to become intimate . I was worried I would hurt her the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first lay down , he was against me , and even with all his clothes I thought : Where 's the rest of him ? He said his people have always been small-boned . <p> Tim : She was bigger than I thought underneath her clothes . Women can hide that stuff pretty well . Her thighs and bottom had a little extra padding , you could call it . I guess love is about compromise . <p> Tiff : It has n't always been easy . One time we got into a huge argument . I was yelling , louder than normal . My roommate told me she almost called the police . I forget what it was about . Later we laughed about it . Tim : Tiff 's got Swiss blood , and the Swiss can get very worked up , very emotional . This one time she threw a box of frozen vegetables at me . Peas and pearl onions . It hit me in the shoulder . She was still coming forward , sort of like charging . I locked myself in the bathroom , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Tim did the sweetest things . He sent a dozen flowers on my birthday , right to my work . The card said : " Happy Birthday-Love , Tim . " It was the first time he told me he loved me . <p> Tim : Tiff can get very jealous . One time we went to Daddio 's to watch line-dancing . I guess this other girl was checking me out or something . Tiff went up to her and kicked her . Not hard . Just as a warning . <p> Tiff : Tim 's real protective . If we went out and other guys were checking me out , he 'd ask them what they were looking at . <p> Tim : They were making noises with their mouths , these guys . I told them to settle down . <p> Tiff : We 'd been dating for eight months and three weeks when we went to visit my dad and his girlfriend and my stepbrother , Randy . They were doing a cookout . It went great . Tim did n't get a chance to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't talk a lot , my dad . <p> Tim : I felt like I would have taken her to see my family , but they live pretty far . <p> Tiff : My girlfriends started asking , " What 's up with you and Tim ? Good lovin ' ? " Like from the song . I just told them to shut up because it 's not like that . But it was , sort of . <p> Tim : My friends were like , " What 's up with you and Tiff ? " Then they 'd make a sound , like a whip being cracked . <p> Tiff : Tim proposed to me on April 20 , 2001 ( my birthday ! ) . He 'd taken me to dinner at Sir Loin and put the ring in the chocolate mousse . Like I told my roommate : I lost a filling , but I gained a fianc6 . <p> Tim : They were n't supposed to put it in the mousse . There was some foul-up . The manager said it was because the dessert guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ June 25 , 2001 . It was about ninety degrees inside the church . Tim looked like he was about to keel over . We were both pretty much sweating . A lot of people were crying , too . <p> Tim : Our honeymoon was spent at Walt Disney World in Orlando , Florida . <p> Tiff : The rides made me kind of sick , but Tim was so sweet . He took everything to the dry cleaners they have there . <p> Tim : She maybe overate a little . <p> Tiff : We stayed for one week , and so far the rest has been spent in the heaven of each other 's love . <p> Tim : We have now been married for four-and-one-half months , and it is among the best moves I ever made . <p> Author Affiliation
