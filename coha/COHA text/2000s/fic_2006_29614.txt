Chapter One The Borders Summer 1136 HELENA WAS DRUNK . Drunker than she 'd ever been in her life . Which was why , no matter how she struggled against the cursed brute of a Norman oaf wrestling her down the castle stairs , she could n't break his hold on her . " Cease , wench ! " her captor hissed , stumbling on a step in the dark . " Bloody hell , you 'll get us both killed . " She would have grappled even harder then , but her right knee suddenly turned to custard . Forsooth , if the Norman had n't caught her against his broad chest , she 'd have tumbled headlong down the stone steps . " Ballocks , " he muttered against her ear , his massive arms tightening around her like a vise . She rolled her eyes as a wave of dizziness washed over her . If only her muscles would cooperate , she thought , she could wrench loose and push the bloody bastard down the stairs . But she was well and truly drunk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found herself in the bedchamber of her sister 's bridegroom , Pagan Cameliard , dagger in hand , ready to kill him . If she had n't been drunk , if she had n't tripped in the dark over Pagan 's man , slumbering at the foot of the bed like some cursed faithful hound , she might have succeeded . Jesu , ' t was a sobering thought . Helena , the daughter of alord , and an honorable Warrior Maid of Rivenloch , had almost slain a man quite dishonorably in his sleep . ' T was not entirely her fault , she decided . She 'd been up until the wee hours , commiserating over a cup , indeed several cups , with her older sister , Deirdre , lamenting the fate of Miriel , their poor little sister , betrothed against her will to a foreigner . And under the influence of excessive wine , they 'd sworn to murder the man if he so much as laid a hand on Miriel . It had seemed such a noble idea at the time . But how Helena @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the bridegroom 's chamber with a knife , she could n't fathom . Indeed , she 'd been shocked to discover the dagger in her hand , though not half as shocked as Sir Colin du Lac , the brawny varlet over whom she 'd tripped , the man who currently half shoved , half carried her down the stairs . Once more , Helena had become a victim of her own impulsiveness . Deirdre frequently scolded Helena for her tendency to act first and ask questions later . Still , Helena 's quick reflexes had saved her more than once from malefactors and murderers and men who mistook her for a helpless maid . While Deirdre might waste time weighing the consequences of punishing a man for insult , Helena would n't hesitate to draw her sword and mark his cheek with a scar he 'd wear to his grave . Her message was clear . No one tangled with the Warrior Maids of Rivenloch . But this time , she feared she 'd gone too far . Pagan 's man grunted as he lifted her over the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he proved as strong and determined as a bull . With a final heave , he deposited her at the threshold of the great hall . The chamber seemed cavernous by the dim glow of the banked fire , its high ceiling obscured by shadow , its walls disappearing into the darkness . By day ' t was a lofty hall decked with the tattered banners of defeated enemies . But by night the frayed pennons hung in the air like lost spirits . A cat hissed and darted past the hearth , its elongated shadow streaking wraithlike along one wall . In the corner , a hound stirred briefly at the disturbance , chuffed once , then lowered his head to his paws again . But the other denizens of the great hall , dozens of snoring servants , huddled upon mounds of rushes and propped against the walls , slumbered on in oblivion . Helena struggled anew , hoping to wake one of them . They were her servants , after all . Anyone seeing the lady of the castle being abducted by a Norman would send up an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise around the wad of the fur coverlet her vile captor had stuffed into her mouth . Even if she managed , she doubted anyone would rouse . The castle folk were exhausted from making hasty preparations for the travesty of a wedding in the morn . " Cease , wench , " Sir Colin bit out , giving her ribs a jerk of warning , " or I 'll string you up now . " She hiccoughed involuntarily . Surely ' t was an idle threat on his part . This Norman could n't hang her . Not in her own castle . Not when her only crime had been protecting her sister . Besides , she had n't killed Pagan . She 'd only attempted to kill him . Still , she swallowed back the bitter taste of doubt . These Normans were vassals of the King of Scotland , and the King had commanded that Pagan wed one of the daughters of Rivenloch . If Helena had succeeded in slaying the King 's man ... ' t would have been high treason , punishable by hanging . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whoa . Steady , Hel-fire . " His whisper against her ear sent an unwelcome shiver along her spine . " Do not faint away on me . " She frowned and hiccoughed again . Hel-fire ! He did n't know the half of it . And how dare he suggest she might faint ? Warrior maids did n't faint . ' T was only her feet tangling in the coverlet as they shuffled through the rushes in the great hall . Then , as they lurched across the flagstones toward the cellar stairs , a different , all-too-familiar sensation brought her instantly alert . Sweet Mary , she was going to be sick . Her stomach seized once . Twice . Her eyes grew wide with horror . One look at the damsel 's beaded brow and ashen pallor told Colin why she 'd stopped in her tracks . " Shite ! " he hissed . Her body heaved again , and he snatched the wad of fur coverlet from her mouth , bending her forward over one arm , away from him , just in time . Fortunately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her head while she lost her supper , he could n't help but feel sorry for the miserable little murderess . She obviously would n't have tried to slay Pagan in his sleep if she had n't been as drunk as an alewife . And he certainly did n't intend to have the maid hanged for treason , no matter what he led her to believe . Executing the sister of Pagan 's bride would destroy the alliance they 'd come to form with the Scots . She 'd obviously done what she 'd done to protect her little sister . Besides , who could drop a noose around a neck as fair and lovely as hers ? Still , he could n't allow the maid to think she could attack a King 's man without consequence . What Colin could n't fathom was why the three sisters of Rivenloch so loathed his commander . Sir Pagan Cameliard was a fierce warrior , aye , a man who led an unparalleled fighting force . But he was kind and gentle with ladies . Indeed , wenches often swooned over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with half a brain would be ecstatic to have Pagan for a husband . Colin would have expected the sisters , sequestered so long in the barren wilds of Scotland , to vie eagerly for the privilege of wedding an illustrious nobleman like Pagan Cameliard . Instead , they quarreled over who would be burdened with him . ' T was perplexing . Poor Helena had ceased heaving , and now the pretty , pitiful maid quivered feebly , like a storm-tossed kitten locked out of the barn . But Colin dared not let compassion override caution . This kitten had shown her claws . He let her up , then instantly drew his dagger , placing it alongside her neck . " I 'll spare you the gag now , damsel , " he told her in a stern whisper , " but I warn you , do not cry out , or I 'll be forced to slit your throat . " Of course , if she 'd known Colin better , she would have laughed in his face . ' T was true , he could kill a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knight with a single expert blow . He was strong and swift with a blade , and he had an uncanny instinct for discerning the point of greatest vulnerability in an opponent . But when it came to beautiful women , Colin du Lac was about as savage as an unweaned pup . Happily , the damsel believed his threat . Or perchance she was simply too weak to fight . Either way , she staggered against him , shuddering as he wrapped the fur coverlet tighter about her shoulders and guided her forward . Beside the entrance to the buttery were a basin and a ewer for washing . He steered her there , propping her against the wall so she would n't fall . Her drooping eyes still smoldered with silent rage as she glared at him , but her pathetic hiccoughs entirely ruined the effect . And , fortunately , she had n't the strength to lend action to her anger . " Open your mouth , " he murmured , using his free hand to pick up the ewer of water . She compressed her lips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire in her eyes and her mouth tight with mutiny , she was truly the most exquisite creature he 'd ever beheld . Her tresses cascaded over her shoulders like the tumbling froth of a highland waterfall , and her curves were more seductive than the sinuous silhouette of a wine-filled goblet . She eyed him doubtfully , as if she suspected he might use the water to drown her on the spot . He supposed she had a right to doubt him . Only moments ago , in Pagan 's chamber , he 'd threatened to , what was it ? Take her where no one could hear her scream and break her of her wild ways at the crack of a whip ? He winced , recalling his rash words . " Listen , " he confided , lowering the ewer , " I said I would n't punish you until the marriage is accomplished . I 'm a man of my word . As long as you do n't force my hand , I 'll do you no harm this eve . " Slowly , reluctantly , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of water into her mouth . As she swished the liquid around , he got the distinct impression she longed to spew it back into his face . But with his blade still at her throat , she did n't dare . Leaning forward , she spit into the rushes . " Good . Come . " When they 'd first arrived , Pagan 's betrothed had given them a tour of the Scots castle that would be their new home . Rivenloch was an impressive holding , probably magnificent in its day , a little worn , but reparable . The outer wall enclosed an enormous garden , an orchard , stables , kennels , mews , and a dovecote . A small stone chapel sat in the midst of the courtyard , and a dozen or more workshops slouched against the inner walls . A grand tiltyard and practice field stood at the far end of the property , and the imposing square keep at the heart of the holding was comprised of the great hall , numerous bedchambers , garderobes , a buttery , a pantry , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storage rooms beneath the keep that he now conveyed his captive . Placing Helena before him , he descended the rough stone steps by the light of a candle set in the stairwell 's sconce . Below them , small creatures scuttled about on their midnight rounds . Colin felt a brief twinge of remorse , wondering if the cellars were infested with mice , if ' t was cruel to lock Helena in there , if she was afraid of the creatures . Just as quickly , he decided that a knife-wielding wench prowling about in a man 's chamber , prepared to stab him in his sleep , was likely afraid of very little . They 'd almost reached the bottom of the stairs when the damsel made a faint moan and , as if her bones had melted away , abruptly withered in his arms . Knocked off-balance by the sudden weight against his chest , he slammed into the stone wall with one shoulder , cinching his arm around her waist so she would n't fall . To prevent a nasty accident , he cast his knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she slumped forward , and he was pulled along with her . Only by sheer strength was he able to keep them from pitching headlong onto the cold , hard flagstones below . Even so , as he struggled down the last few steps , the fur coverlet snagged on his heel and slipped sideways on her body . He lost his grip upon her waist and made another desperate grab for her as her knees buckled . His hand closed on something soft and yielding as he slid off the last step and finally found his footing at the bottom of the stairs . Colin had fondled enough breasts to recognize the soft flesh pressed sweetly against his palm . But he dared not let go for fear she 'd drop to the ground . In the next instant , she roused again , drawing in a huge gasp of outrage , and Colin knew he was in trouble . Luckily , since he 'd received his share of slaps for past fondlings , he was prepared . As her arm came around , not with a chiding open palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and ducked back out of range . Her swing was so forceful that when it swished through empty air , it spun her halfway around . " Holy ... , " he breathed . Had the maid not been drunk , the punch would have certainly flattened him . " Y ' son of a ... , " she slurred . She blinked , trying to focus on him , her fists clenched in front of her as she planned her next strike . " Get yer hands off me . I 'll kick yer bloody Norm'n arse . Swear I will . S- " Her hands began to droop , and her eyes dimmed as she swayed left , then right , staggering back a step . Then whatever fight she had left in her fizzled out like the last wheezing draw on a wineskin . He rushed up , catching her just before she collapsed . Cradled against his flank , all the fury and fight gone out of her , she looked less like a warrior maid and more like the guileless Helena he 'd first spied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sun-kissed skin and riotous tawny hair , the woman who 'd splashed seductively through his dreams . Had that been only this morn ? So much had transpired in the last few weeks . A fortnight ago , Sir Pagan had received orders from King David of Scotland to venture north to Rivenloch to claim one of Lord Gellir 's daughters . At the time , the King 's purpose had been a mystery . But now ' t was clear what he intended . King Henry 's death had left England in turmoil , with Stephen and Matilda grappling for control of the throne . That turmoil had fomented lawlessness along the Borders , where land-hungry English barons felt at liberty to seize unguarded Scots castles . King David had granted Pagan a bride , and thus the stewardship of Rivenloch , in the hopes of guarding the valuable keep against English marauders . Despite the King 's sanction , Pagan had proceeded with caution . He 'd traveled with Colin in advance of his knights to ascertain the demeanor of the Rivenloch clan . The Normans might be allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hearty reception if they arrived in full force , like a conquering army , to claim the lord 's daughter . As it turned out , he was right to be wary . Their reception , at least by the daughters , had been far less than hearty . But by God 's grace , by midday on the morrow , after the alliance was sealed by marriage , peace would reign . And the Scots , once they were made merry with drink and celebration , would surely welcome the full complement of the Knights of Cameliard to Rivenloch . Helena gave a snort in her sleep , and Colin smiled ruefully down at her . She 'd offer him no word of welcome . Indeed , she 'd likely prefer to slit his throat . He bent to slip one forearm behind her knees and hefted her easily into his arms . One of the small storerooms looked seldom used . It held little more than broken furnishings and tools , piles of rags , and various empty containers . It had a bolt on the outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it had likely been employed at one time for just this purpose , as a gaol of sorts . Indeed , ' t was an ideal place to store a wayward wench for the night . He spread the fur coverlet atop an improvised pallet of rags to make a bed for her . She might be an assassin , but she was also a woman . She deserved at least a small measure of comfort . After he tucked the coverlet about her shoulders , he could n't resist combing back a stray tendril of her lush golden brown hair to place a smug kiss upon her forehead . " Sleep well , little Hel-hound . " ( Continues ... )
