Section : Nation &; World Campaign 2006 After all the debates , campaign stops , and TV ads , it may all just come down to this : Which party can get its voters to the polls ? <p> BLUE BELL , PA. - Here 's Rick Santorum 's plan to close his challenger 's big lead in the polls and pull off a surprise win next week : a phone bank staffed with a half-dozen die-hard volunteers in this Philadelphia suburb . " The Republican Party is committed to protecting America in the war on terror and securing our borders , " says Jack Posobiec , a Temple University senior , into a phone receiver on the second-to-last Tuesday before the election . " Can the party count on your vote ? " Posobiec takes down the " Yes " response on a sheet of paper that will be scanned into the GOP 's vast national voter database , then dials the next number on his list . It 's the kind of person-to-person transaction , repeated millions of times over , that forms the grass-roots ground game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> This year , facing its toughest political climate in over a decade ( Santorum is just one of several Republican senators in a fight for their political lives ) , the GOP is counting on that get-out-the-vote machine more than ever . " Turnout in an off-year election is more important than in a presidential election because voters on both sides are less motivated , " says a senior Republican adviser . Turnout this year is expected to be down by more than a third from 2004 , which is why more than 20 GOP phone banks and volunteer centers across Pennsylvania have already contacted more than a million voters most likely to back Santorum-who is running up to 12 points behind challenger Bob Casey Jr . " The goal is to get Casey 's lead to single digits by Election Day , " says Santorum campaign manager Vince Galko . " The grass roots will take it from there . " <p> Dispirited . With only days to go , however , achieving that goal appears iffy , at best . The revved-up Republican base that staffed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 2004 as part of the GOP 's " 72-hour plan " now appears dispirited . At the Blue Bell phone bank , one volunteer called a half-dozen Republicans who 'd expressed interest in joining this year 's " 72-hour task force " before finding a taker . The Democrats , meanwhile , say they 've improved their ground game since 2004 , when the Democratic National Committee 's voter file-the road map for turnout efforts-was so glitch-prone that Ohio 's Democratic Party could n't access it until a week before Election Day . In dozens of close races nationwide , the ability of the GOP turnout effort to deliver again , or the Democrats ' ability to best it , will determine the outcome next week-and , with it , which party controls Congress . <p> The Democrats , by relying on organized labor , had historically maintained an edge on turnout operations-until President Bush was elected . But the GOP , under the direction of White House political chief Karl Rove and Republican National Committee Chairman Ken Mehlman , began running its turnout operation like a business , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In this cycle , Mehlman received weekly reports from state parties that showed how well each was managing its " metric " goals , starting a full year before Election Day . <p> Fueled by $30 million from the RNC , Republican officials insist their turnout machine is still humming . They point to victories this year in the special election to replace former Rep. Randy " Duke " Cunningham in California and in Rhode Island , where the party backed Sen. Lincoln Chafee against a formidable primary challenger . " I see increasing levels of energy manifested in more volunteers than ever , " Mehlman tells U.S. News . In Ohio , where Republicans are trailing in the Senate and gubernatorial races , and where Democrats are expected to pick up as many as five House seats , the state GOP last week reported making 175,000 voter contacts in one day , a new record . " Democrats can talk up their poll advantages , " says state party political director Jason Mauk . " Those numbers are a mile wide and an inch deep if you ca n't turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the GOP 's 72-hour campaign-a misnomer , actually , since the effort has been underway for more than a year-comes this week , when they 'll see if they can match the 1.2 million volunteers they had nationwide in 2004 . Even a more modest grass-roots army may be difficult to muster this year , with so many evangelicals , who provided much of the activist muscle for Rove and Mehlman in 2004 and cast 2 of every 5 Bush votes , now undecided . With the Mark Foley scandal and the failure of the Republican-controlled Congress to deliver on conservative causes like a constitutional ban on same-sex marriage , " even the most loyal Republican evangelical would conclude that faith should not be placed in either party . " says Colin Hanna , president of the Pennsylvania Pastors Network , which organizes conservative Christian voters . <p> Reminders . Democrats , meanwhile , say their base is fired up . " A lot of our direct mail is just pictures of Bush , Cheney , and Rumsfeld , " says Pennsylvania Democratic Party chair T. J. Rooney . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys are . " Maybe . A Washington Post/ABC News poll last week found no difference in the " intensity " between the two parties , with 80 percent of Republicans and 78 percent of Democrats voicing enthusiasm for voting this year . <p> And given the breakdowns in the DNC 's 2004 turnout effort , plus the extent to which voter turnout was handled by outside groups like Americans Coming Together , the Democrats ' revamped ground game still has a lot to prove . The DNC has overhauled its voter file , with more accurate data and a new technological platform that allows it to be continually updated by state parties . The file is being leveraged by the hundreds of organizers hired under the auspices of chairman Howard Dean 's 50-state strategy , which aims to rebuild the national party in every corner of the nation . <p> DNC state-level organizers have been contacting drop-off Democrats-those who vote in presidential elections but not midterms-and have reached half a million in Pennsylvania alone in the past year and a half . Roughly 4,500 of those contacted have taken an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or staffing a phone bank . " We 're doing exactly what we need to do to be organized . " says Claire McCaskill , the challenger to Republican Jim Talent in Missouri 's tight Senate race . " This year just feels so much different than last time . " <p> Unlike the centralized Republican effort , the DNC and the Democrats ' House and Senate election committees are each running separate turnout programs . The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has put $10 million into its effort , more than twice as much as in 2002 , and started working last summer with 40 Democratic House campaigns-mostly challengers-to create field programs that could replicate the GOP 's 72-hour plan . The DCCC is also microtargeting voters for the first time , identifying Democratic voters in majority Republican areas rather than simply working Democratic strongholds . <p> " Drumbeat . " Even with such innovations , Democrats are still leaning heavily on Big Labor , particularly the AFL-CIO . In Pennsylvania alone , members have been making 112,000 phone calls a week since August to the state 's roughly 1.4 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tractor-trailer , a dozen middle-aged union workers last week dialed into Pennsylvania 's 10th District to promote Democratic challenger Chris Carney over Rep. Don Sherwood . " In 2002 , our message was n't as well received , " says James Weyrauch , a Department of Labor employee working the phone bank . " It 's because we did n't have the Iraq war . " <p> But some Democratic candidates are facing their own base motivation problems , with recent polls showing lower-than-normal black support for Democratic Senate candidates like Missouri 's McCaskill , who was n't cracking 50 percent black support in a poll earlier this month . Other polls show African-Americans more likely than whites to doubt that their votes will be counted because of voting controversies in recent years . " I hear Talent really trying to address some issues near and dear to the African community , " says St. Louis Rep. William Lacy Clay , a Democrat . " I do n't hear the same drumbeat from the McCaskill camp . " <p> While acknowledging McCaskill 's ties to the black community , St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done a tremendous job recruiting African-Americans . " But , he adds , " people are really angry . If nothing else gets African-Americans to the polls , it 's anger . " If that 's still not enough , perhaps a call from one of the two parties will do the trick .
