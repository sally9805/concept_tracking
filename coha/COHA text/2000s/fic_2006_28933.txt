" It does n't look burned . " " No , " said her father , squinting and shading his eyes with his hand . They had paused halfway across the weedy backyard . " Are you sure she said ' shed ' ? " " Yes -- 'I 've burned down the Kaleidoscope Shed , ' she told me . " Daphne Marrity sat down on a patch of grass and straightened her skirt , peering at the crooked old gray structure that was visible now under the shadow of the shaggy avocado tree . It would probably burn up pretty fast , if anybody was to try to burn it . The shingled roof was patchy , sagging in the middle , and the two dusty wood-framed windows on either side of the closed door seemed to be falling out of the clapboard wall ; it probably leaked badly in the rain . Daphne had heard that her father and aunt had sometimes sneaked out here to play in the shed when they were children , though they were n't allowed to . The door was so low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she was not a particularly tall twelve-year-old . It was probably when they were too young to go to school , she thought . Or else it 's because I was born in 1975 , and kids are taller now than they were back then . " The tree would have burned up too , " she noted . " You 're going to get red ants all overyou . She might have dreamed it . I do n't think it was a , a joke . " Her father glanced around , frowning , clearly irritated . He was sweating , even with his jacket folded over his arm . " Gold under the bricks , " Daphne reminded him . " And she dreamed that too . I wonder where she is . " There had been no answer to his knock on the front door of the house , but when they had walked around the corner and pushed open the backyard gate they had seen that the old green Rambler station wagon was in the carport , in the yellow shade of the corrugated fiberglass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squinted up at him against the sun 's glare . " Why did she call it the Kaleidosope Shed ? " " It --  " He laughed . " We all called it that . I do n't know . " He had stepped on what he 'd been about to say . She sighed and looked toward the shed again . " Let 's go in it and pull up some bricks . I can watch out for spiders , " she added . Her father shook his head . " I can see from here that it 's padlocked . We should n't even be hanging around back here when Grammar 's not home . " Grammar was the family name for the old lady , and it had not made Daphne like her any better . " We had to , to see if she really did burn it down like she said . Now we should see if " she thought quickly --  " if she passed out in there from gasoline fumes . Maybe she meant , ' I 'm about to burn it down . ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Maybe she 's passed out behind the shed . She did call you about the shed , and she does n't answer the door , and her car is here . " " Oh . . . " He squinted and began to shake his head , so she went on quickly . " ' Screw your courage to the sticking place , ' " she said . " Maybe there really is gold under the bricks . Did n't she have a lot of money ? " He smiled distractedly . " ' And we 'll not fail . ' She did get some money in ' 55 , I 've heard . " " How old was she then ? " Daphne got to her feet , brushing down the back of her skirt . " About fifty-five , I guess . She 's probably about eighty-seven now . Any money she 's got is in the bank . " " Not in the bank -- she 's a hippie , is n't she ? " Even now , at twelve , Daphne was still somewhat afraid of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grinding German accent , and her wrinkly old cheeks always wet with the artificial tears she bought in little bottles at Thrifty . Daphne had never been allowed in the old woman 's backyard , and this was the first time she 'd ever been farther out than the back porch . " Or a witch , " she added . Daphne took her father 's hand as a tentative prelude to starting toward the shed . " She is n't a witch , " he said , laughing . " And she is n't a hippie either . She 's too old to have been a hippie . " " She went to Woodstock . You never went to Woodstock . " " She probably just went to sell her necklaces . " " As weapons , I bet , " Daphne said , recalling the clunky talismans . The old woman had given Daphne one on her seventh birthday , a stone thing on a necklace chain , and before the day was out , Daphne had nearly given herself a concussion with it , swinging it around ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had buried the object with the cat . She tried to project the thought to him : Let 's check out the shed . " Hippies did n't have weapons . Okay , I 'll look around in back of the shed . " He began walking forward , leading the way and holding her hand , stepping carefully through the dry grass and high green weeds . His brown leather Top-Siders ground creosote smells out of the bristly green stalks . " Watch where you put your feet , " he said over his shoulder , " she 's got all kinds of old crap out here . " " Old crap , " Daphne echoed . " Car-engine parts , broken air conditioners , suits of medieval armor I would n't be surprised . I should carry you , your legs are going to get all scratched . " " Even skinny I 'm too heavy now . You 'd get apoplexy . " " I could carry two girls your size , one under each arm . " They had stepped in under the shade of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corduroy jacket . He shook his head as if at the silliness of all this , then waded through the rank greenery to the corner of the shed and disappeared around it . She could hear him brushing against the shed 's far wall , and cussing , and knocking boards over . Continues ...
