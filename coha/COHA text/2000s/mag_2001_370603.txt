In 1991 , after she had been in New York City for almost 10 years , the Mississippi woman known as Cassandra Wilson made a recording titled Blue Skies and set herself ahead of all other jazz singers , except for the longtime giants Sarah Vaughan , Ella Fitzgerald and Betty Carter . With a sensuality too purely adult and far too lyrical to be confused with either the mush or the vulgarity that defines too much popular singing , Wilson remakes standard songs as though none of the lessons laid down by the greats have been lost on her . <P> Wilson knows how to tell a story and how to twist odd sounds out of her throat , which gives the impression that the emotion is so strong it can not be held in place by a voice or a note . Above all , she does n't sound like a child or some jaded hussy given to parading self-denigration as a false form of honesty . In her brown beauty , she is a fully grown woman who has high command of the rhythm called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pursuit of happiness . <P> She prepared for these achievements in her hometown of Jackson , Miss. , where she was born in 1955 and began singing at age five . Her local experience was varied , but she did n't settle on jazz singing until her early 20s . When she arrived in New York in 1982 , Wilson worked in Harlem clubs with names like the Red Rooster and Small 's Paradise . <P> A breakthrough came after she met alto saxophonist Steve Coleman , the guru of a group of young musicians in Brooklyn who were trying to find new ways of playing . Coleman got his followers interested in African music , in unusual harmonies and novel forms of organization . " From Steve Coleman , " Wilson says , " I learned to tear a piece of music apart and get away from standard approaches . I learned about cycles of rhythm , being able to hear cues in the rhythms instead of chords . And I learned to hear the layering of rhythms . Before that , I had been only studying chords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was able to return to standard material whenever I wanted to and find so many other things to do that I could n't have imagined before . " <P> It is on those familiar songs that you find her most effective and artistically startling . With that thick contralto , Wilson tunes into the wavelengths of romance in all its bounces , its bends , its heights and its cold-shouldered loneliness . There is no more purely and uncontrived female force in our national music today . <P> Stanley Crouch 's latest book is Do n't the Moon Look Lonesome : A Novel of Blues and Swing
