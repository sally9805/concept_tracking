Actually , the Supreme Court 's problem is not merely disconnection from the real world-it 's also arrogance , dishonesty , grandiosity , and a lack of respect for principle , history , or logic // Conservatives complain that the Supreme Court is too liberal . Liberals complain that it 's too conservative . Both charges are inaccurate : in reality the Court is a careful political actor that arguably represents the center of gravity of American politics better than most politicians do . The real problem is not the Supreme Court 's politics but the depressing quality of its work . This is hardly a radical opinion . In fact , it 's the viewpoint of many of the people who ought to know best how to evaluate the Supreme Court 's decisionmaking : judges on the lower appeals courts . When one talks to them about America 's top court , frustration with the justices ' performance is a common theme . Naturally , some of this frustration is political , and some of it is the sort of griping you hear from middle management about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking is a basic unhappiness with the Court 's quality and integrity-a sense from the left , right , and center alike that the Court blithely ignores its own principles and precedents when they 're inconvenient ; rules on matters not properly before it to reach the result the majority seeks ; misstates facts ; and issues shoddy opinions that give insufficient guidance to the lower courts . In short , the justices routinely behave in a manner they would never tolerate from the judges whose opinions they review . Much of this carping is private , but not all . Laurence Silberman-now a senior judge on the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals-has for years been railing publicly against the Court for its infidelity to its own precedents . In some opinions he has openly taunted the justices . In one he called the Supreme Court a " noncourt court " that " rarely considers itself bound by the reasoning of its prior opinions . " In another he accused the justices of dishonesty for being unanimously unwilling to " restrict their own ability to reach out to issues not presented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify that practice by openly acknowledging the Supreme Court as not subject to normal judicial constraints . " Silberman is a controversial figure , a conservative luminary who inspires deep suspicion among some liberals . But he is an unusually principled man , with a particularly admirable history of putting politics aside when it counts . His critique of the Court , moreover , is not essentially political but methodological . The cases that drive him wild involve not hot-button social issues ( though he certainly has opinions on those ) but obscure and apolitical rulings that do n't rile normal passions-for example , the one in a 1993 case involving insurance and banking regulations issued by the comptroller of the currency . What 's more , Silberman is as unsparing of the conservative justices-some of whom are his close friends-as he is of the Court 's liberal wing . Silberman recently told me he was in " despair " about the Court . " Every one " of the justices , he said , is guilty , to one degree or another , of violating the two most basic rules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the case at hand , and interpreting precedents honestly . " I stopped reading Supreme Court opinions years ago , because I got too depressed-unless I have to read them for a particular case or I 'm teaching them , " he said . Silberman 's specific concerns may seem minor to a lay observer-and his anxiety consequently histrionic-but they are less technical than they appear . Courts are supposed to resolve cases , not make broader policy , which is exactly what happens when they decide more than the question a case presents . And courts are supposed to be principled , applying the same rules to everyone ; so it is infuriating when they articulate a rule and then ignore it . " Federal judges are the only senior government officials who have to set down in writing exactly why they do everything that counts , " Silberman says . " I think the single most important thing judges can do when they write opinions is be honest about their reasoning . " The justices , however , misrepresent their reasoning so egregiously that " I tell my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students how to understand the holding of a case . " Few circuit-court judges feel quite as hopeless about the current Court as Silberman does . Richard Posner , for example , who sits on the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals , says , " The Supreme Court has never paid much heed to its own precedents-that 's nothing new . " But Silberman 's critique has wider resonance than you might guess . One conservative judge notes with weary amusement the tendency of justices of all ideological stripes to simply ignore the tough arguments that dissenters from their rulings offer . Given the justices ' power not merely to strike down acts of the political branches but also to overrule-or just disregard-their own prior holdings , they " more or less inevitably ... act as super-legislators pretending to be judges , " he says . " The result is not a pretty sight . " Liberal circuit judges are equally harsh . In a public panel in 2003 William Fletcher , a judge on the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals , blasted the Supreme Court for distorting the facts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had written . " Politicians are politicians , " he said . " We are accustomed to their half-truths and their untruths ... But we are here dealing with a court . If a court will systematically change the meaning of words so as to distort what are the actual facts of the case , our judicial system is in trouble . " One liberal judge I spoke with charges contemptuously that the justices often seem unfamiliar with the factual records underlying the cases they decide . " I spend huge portions of my preparation time reading the record , " he says . " They almost never read the record . " Some judges are at least partly resigned to such shenanigans , which , as Posner suggests , are nothing new . Indeed , many judges see the Court 's behavior as consistent with its history . Howlingly bad opinions , shot through with faulty reasoning and manipulated facts , have surfaced occasionally through the decades . But despite the attention such cases garner , they have never been the norm , and they are probably no more common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honesty and rigor , of the kind that drive lower-court judges nuts , may not be more common either . But they are more naked now . The sheer power of the Court is growing constantly , and as the Court asserts itself in more and more policy areas , its failings become more apparent and troublesome than in the past . The justices do n't have to observe precedent , so they fudge doctrine . They do n't have to describe facts accurately , so they take liberties . They do n't have to restrain themselves , so they do n't . And they do n't have to write opinions rigorously enough to give precise guidance to the lower courts , which do not have the luxury of winging it . So they hand down opinions that sometimes leave the lower courts breathless with astonishment . For example , I have heard no end of complaints from judges about the Supreme Court 's recent series of decisions striking down state and federal sentencing rules . Part of their problem was substantive-some judges disagreed with the Court 's ruling . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Court had potentially invalidated thousands of sentences yet was not remotely clear about how the lower courts should handle the chaos . The Supreme Court has a related problem with grandiosity-a tendency both to arrogate to itself decisions other actors are far better situated to make and to embellish its work with needless puffery . Justice Anthony Kennedy , not content to strike down state sodomy laws , began his opinion on the subject two years ago by rhapsodizing that " freedom extends beyond spatial bounds " and contains " more transcendent dimensions . " This sort of rhetoric , which reads more like a second-rate philosophy term paper than a judicial opinion , is a far cry from the deep institutional modesty of , for example , Justice Byron White , who left the Court in 1993 . Asked in 1962 about his view of the constitutional role of the Supreme Court , White responded , " To decide cases . " Richard Posner notes wryly that although the justices are " for the most part able lawyers , " none is " a Philosopher King , or even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or Robert Jackson in depth of insight or ... breadth of experience , " so " it would be nice if they wielded their authority with greater restraint . " But it 's hard to get a peacock to stop preening . And it 's no less hard to create incentives for greater judicial rigor and honesty when the Supreme Court itself is the final word on what the law means . The only option , really , is shaming-and criticism of the justices from the outside does n't seem to move them much . Silberman speculates that the root of the problem is a design flaw in the Constitution itself . " If I had to do it all over again , " he told me sadly , " if I were framing the Constitution , I would have provided that all Supreme Court justices sat for ten years and then came back as circuit judges " - in which role they would once again be bound by precedent and accountable to higher judicial authorities . As things stand , he says , " I do n't have much hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... I think most judges think I 'm a little naive to think the Supreme Court could ever be reduced in ego size to a court . Maybe that 's right . " It probably is . But my guess is that if all the judges who privately share Silberman 's anxiety-even in milder form-were more open about their views , shame would become a more powerful restraining force on the Court . Not even Supreme Court justices , after all , want to be held in contempt . Author Affiliation Benjamin Wittes is an editorial writer at The Washington Post . // <p>
