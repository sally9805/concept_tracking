Chapter One " You feel anything ? " " Nope . " " Maybe you 're supposed to hold it in longer . " It was summer in Indiana , the week before I turned sixteen . All afternoon my friends and I had been on our bikes , following the mosquito truck through the streets , breathing the sweet-smelling clouds of DDT because we 'd heard it would get you high . One glimpse of Dad 's steel-blue Oldsmobile Delta 88 in our driveway on a Thursday was enough to bring all the fun screeching to a halt . I waved the boys to go on without me . My father was a good man- I can say that now , after all these years and everything that happened-but on a day-to-day basis , he was about as fun as Hitler . Dimly I remembered a time when he picked us up in his arms , hugged us , played with us like any other dad . As we got older , though , he turned against us . He had to be hard , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name was Lee Ray Musgrove . He came from a poor Alabama family of Musgroves who went all the way broke in the Depression . Dad never got over how poor they used to be . The Depression always loomed over our family like a dark thundercloud , a certain promise of doom just beyond the horizon . Every Monday at four a.m . Dad would arise to eat his lonely bowl of Wheat Chex , check hislist of sales calls , and head out to keep that thundercloud at bay for one more week . Monday to Friday he was a traveling salesman , the jolliest most hardworking devoted salesman in the history of TriDex , District Salesmanager of the Year three years in a row , a good smile , a nice word for everybody . All week he saved up his anger , all the slights and disappointments and frustrations of a salesman 's life , and on Friday nights he brought it all home to us . But now he was home on a Thursday . This was different . At our house , different was never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garage without making a sound . The back door squealed and gave me away . His growl from the family room : " Get in here . Where have you been ? " When Dad used that voice , he did n't want an answer . I crept into the room . The whole family was gathered around the TV but the set was turned off . This must be some really bad news . I eased myself down between Bud and Janie on the sofa . They all looked so somber I thought someone must have died . " All present and accounted for , " Dad said . " Okay , here 's the big announcement . I got a transfer . We 're moving again . " I tingled all over , as if my body had gone to sleep for an instant . A transfer . TriDex transferred its salesmen every year or two , to keep them on their toes . Indiana was our sixth transfer in ten years . TriDex did not know or care that this was my favorite of all the places we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get to stay here . I loved Indiana . I had lots of friends . It was flat , you could ride your bike everywhere . In the winter it froze hard and snowed a lot , so you could stay inside and watch TV all the time . I waded into the rising silence : " Moving where ? " " Mississippi , " said Dad , " and I do n't want any lip out of you . " " Aw now , Lee , do n't say it that way . " Mom interposed herself between Dad by the sliding glass door and us on the sofa . " Y'all , this is big news for Daddy - for all of us , really . You know how bad I been wanting to get closer to Granny and Jacko ... and you know how I hate the winters up here . " That was true . Mom was a flower of the South . Her feet had been cold since the first time Dad moved her away from Alabama . " Are you nuts ? " Bud said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I just made varsity . " Bud was a wrestler . Dad was proud of the fact that Bud wrestled so hard he puked after every match . " Aw now , Bud , come on , it 's a better territory for Daddy , " said Mom , " and anyway we have n't got a choice , so let 's just go on and be happy about it . " " You all can go , I do n't care , I 'm staying , " said Bud . " I 'm a senior this fall , Mom , we ca n't move to - where did you say ? Mississippi ? That 's the dumbest thing I ever heard ! " Bud took my breath away saying things like that , things that would have got me backhanded and sent to my room . Dad darkened and loomed in his corner , but stayed silent . Bud looked like Dad , and Dad respected him for that . " Okay Bud , you stay here , " Mom said with a desperate smile . " Who 's gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If Buddy 's staying I wan na stay , " Janie said . " Nobody 's staying , " said Mom . " We know how to move , we 've done it plenty of times . The movers will be here Monday morning bright and early to start packing . " Bud got up and slammed down the hall to his room BANG ! " I 'll be dog , " said my father . " I 'll be god dog , that boy ... " " Now Lee , " Mom said , " do n't start . " " Start what ? Do n't you start . " " I told you they 'll need some time , honey . Of course they 're not gon na be happy at first - having to go off from all their little friends . " She turned anxious eyes on Janie and me . " I promise , you 'll like it down there . You 'll make new friends . Daddy 's found us a beautiful house in the country . The schools are supposed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , I bet . Mississippi ? " I 'd never been there , but I knew all about it from the evening news . Mississippi was last in everything you could measure . There was nothing down there but redneck sheriffs and protesting Negroes and civil rights workers buried in earthen dams . " There 's nothing wrong with Mississippi , " Mom said . " It 's nice and warm , for one thing , and at least the people will understand me when I talk . " " What if we do n't want to go ? " I said . " Why do we have to ? " " Daddy 's got a new territory . " She fingered a sheaf of honey-gold hair from her eyes . " A smaller territory , so he wo n't have to be gone so much . " She turned smiling , but Dad 's eyes were narrowed down , fixed on me , waiting for one word that would give him the right to come over there and strangle me . " Mississippi is the Magnolia State , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Jackson . The products are cotton , lumber , poultry , and cattle . " " Good , Janie , " said Mom . " I told you those books would come in handy . " Mom was trying to sell this as a big promotion for Dad , but I knew better . I was almost sixteen , I knew everything . I read their mail , I went through their filing cabinet . I read the life insurance policy and thrilled at how rich we kids would be if they died . Many nights I had heard my father god-dogging the name of Larry Semple , his district manager . I knew that a smaller territory in Mississippi had to be a comedown from a three-state sales district based in Indiana . I knew just where to stick in the knife . " Why does he have a smaller territory ? " A subterranean vibration from Dad 's side of the room , a trembling of air . Janie preened for the invisible camera that always followed her around . " Well , I 'm glad we 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place too , Mama . It 's cold . And I want to live closer to Granny . " " Attagirl , " Mom said . " The power of positive thinking . " I coughed the word " suck-up " into my hand . " Mom ! He called me a suck-up ! " " I did not . I coughed . Ca n't a person even cough ? " On Monday we watched the movers load our things onto a giant orange tractor-trailer from Allied Van Lines . On Tuesday we set out down the brand-new interstate highway toward our future . We drove all day , into the late afternoon . South of Memphis we hit a bump that banged my cheek against the glass . The four-lane highway had become a broken two-lane . A sign said WELCOME TO MISSISSIPPI The land flattened out and got wide . At first glance it looked like Indiana again : green flat fields running off to the horizon , fence lines and grain elevators in the blue distance . But instead of neat Midwestern farmhouses I saw tarpaper shacks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rags , stooped old men in straw hats . Occasionally a mansion peeked out of a huge grove of oaks - a Greek temple with columns , white and impressively hidden . Mom said , " Can you imagine living in a house like that ? I would feel just like Scarlett . " " Mama , " said Janie , " that girl has n't got on a shirt . " " Do n't stare , Jane . People ca n't help it if they 're not as well off as us . " " Hmp . " My father scratched his neck . " Anybody 's willing to work can get along these days . Not like we had it in the Depression . " " They let her just run around without a shirt ? " Janie threw herself against the seat to watch the girl receding in the rear window . " She 's as old as me . " " Well , it 's hot down here , honey , " said Mom . " I 'm sure she has a nice shirt she wears all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost chilly , but beyond the glass you could see waves of heat rising up from the road and the fields . Even flashing by at sixty-five miles an hour , you could see sweat on people 's faces . " Oh heavenly days , " Mom said , " it 's so good to be home . Let 's just open up and see how she feels . " She cranked down her window . In an instant , every ounce of cool air was sucked out and replaced with this blast of summer air - a hot , wet slap in the face . We hollered and moaned until Mom rolled the window back up . She grinned . " Hot ! Just like I like it . " Now that we were back in the South , Mom 's accent had kicked in - the thickest sweetest south-Alabama accent you ever heard . Just lack I lack it ! " I am never going outside again - never , " said Bud . " This house better have dang good air-conditioning . " " Oh , you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You boys got a world of grass to cut . " " It 's a country place , y'all , " Mom said . " It 's out from town , so it 's got all the peace and quiet you 'd ever want , and a great big old yard . I ca n't wait to put in some azaleas . They 'll be blooming when Indiana is still up to their eyeballs in snow . " " Nobody knows if the stupid school even has a wrestling team , " Bud said . " I 'm sure if they do n't , they have something just as good , " said Mom . " They practically invented football down here . " " I hate football , " said Bud . " Do n't let anybody down here hear you say that , " Dad said . " I mean it , Bud . " " Mommy , I 'm hungry , " said Janie . " Well you were n't twenty minutes ago , when we had lunch . " Mom rattled the Kroger sack . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or there 's still one ham and cheese . " " Peanut butter but take off the crust . " " The crust is the best part , " said Dad . Dad was not just saying this to make Janie eat the crust . This was the thing about Dad : not only was the crust good enough for Dad , he considered it the best part . He liked the neck of the chicken on Sunday . He liked leftover corn pone with cracklins , served cold , with turnip greens , for breakfast . He liked food that tasted like when he was poor . He squinted into the distance at the long line of cars backed up in our lane - a traffic jam in the middle of nowhere , stretching around the next curve . " Would you look at this ? " He blew out a sigh as if all these cars had stopped way out here just to get on his nerves . He folded his hands behind his neck , cracked his shoulder joints . " Come on , people , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We got miles to go . " We idled behind an old station wagon from Kentucky , overflowing with kids who stuck out their tongues at us and smeared their dirty feet on the windows . You could just smell the misery rolling off that car . The parents were shrunk down in the front seat , ignoring everything to the best of their ability . " Thank God we had just the three , " said Dad . Mom smiled . " Amen to that . " " You guys , " Bud said . " Thanks a lot . " " Take a look at that car , boy , " said Dad . " That right there is as good an argument for birth control as you 'll ever see . " " Lee . " Janie said , " What 's birth control ? " " Now see what you started ? " " It 's a way of making sure you do n't take on more than you can handle . " Dad laid his hand on the horn to join the chorus . Across a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind a wall of pines . " Hey Dad , something 's burning . " He looked where I was pointing . " You know you may be right , it 's a durn house afire , and all these people are just rubbernecking . " He pounded the horn . " Get a move on ! Did n't you ever see a fire before ? " The guy with all the children honked too , and waved his fist out the window . That was something large and on fire , sending up rolling clouds of black smoke and flashes of flame . The people in front of us began three-point-turning their cars , driving past us . Mom said , " Everybody 's going the other way . " Dad coasted forward one car length . " It would take you twice as long , time you went around . " He fiddled with the radio , settling on an old flat-voiced man giving a farm report . " Your soybeans is headed up again , and your cotton holding steady as she goes , " the man said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report is brought to you by the good people of TriDex Chemical , We Know What Bugs You . " My father said , " Hey hey ! " and turned up the volume . " Listen to that . Just got here and already talking about us on the radio . " " That 's a good sign , " said Mom . " It 's like a welcome . I tell you , Lee , this is all going to work out for the best . " More people were giving up , turning around , heading the other way . We crept around the bend . Now we could see it was not a house burning but something in the road , hidden by the rise just ahead . State trooper cars flashed blue lights . Troopers in wide-brimmed hats waved traffic off the highway . " Heck of an accident , " Dad said . " Must be a tanker truck , way it 's burning . " " That 's cool , " said Bud . " It 's not ' cool , ' Bud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No , but I mean look at it burn , " Bud said . " Do n't get too close , Daddy . I do n't want to see any burned people . " " Do n't worry , Janie . Neither do I. " Now we could see it was a tractor-trailer jackknifed , sprawled on its side across both lanes . A crowd of firemen and state troopers stood at a healthy distance , watching the fire- a huge orange toy , broken and burning , pouring fire from the cab and the split-open trailer . Two men in gray uniforms stood off to one side . One of them bent over with his hands on his knees , as if he was about to throw up . It took me a moment to think , Hey I know that guy , and to flash a picture of where I 'd seen him : yesterday , closing the doors of the Allied Van Lines truck at our house in Indiana . " Hey Dad , " I said , " that 's the guy who put our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That guy , there ! Is n't he the guy from Allied ? " And then it dawned on me why our driver was standing there with those state troopers beside the burning wreck . The wreck was his truck . Our truck . Dad steered the Oldsmobile onto the grassy bank . He switched off the engine , rolled down his window , folded his hands on the wheel . Hot acrid air filled the car . We heard the popping and crackling , the rifle-shot of aerosol cans exploding , a deep monstrous underneath sound , like a beast sucking air . Janie said , " Why did we stop ? " " You idiot ! " I cried . " Do n't you get it ? That 's our stuff ! " " What do you mean our stuff . " " Children . " I shiver to remember the silvery calm of Mom 's voice . " I do n't want to hear another word . " A trooper came bowlegging down the hill toward us . " Folks , " he said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along . " My father 's neck turned very red , as if he 'd been sunburned suddenly . I could not see his face , but the sight of it was enough to back the trooper up a step . " Come on now , " he said . " Y'all had your look , let 's move on along now . " My father did not speak . He just stared at the man . " Sir ? Maybe you did n't hear what I said . " My mother leaned across the seat . " Officer , that truck is from Allied Van Lines , is n't it ? " " Why , yes ma'am , it is . " " Well see , I 'm Peggy Musgrove , and this is my husband Lee ? And the thing is , I do believe those are our belongings on that truck . " " Hm . " The man 's face did n't change . " Y'all movin ' down this way ? " " Yes , sir , we were , " Mom said , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me one note short of a scream . " Well , I hate to be the one to tell you , ma'am , but I do n't think you 're gone be able to save too much out of that . " He indicated the conflagration with a little wave of his hand , as if maybe we had n't noticed it . " Could you ask your husband to come up here and talk to us a minute ? " " I do n't think he is able , right now , " Mom said . " Would it be all right if I came in his place ? " Bud opened his door . " I 'll go with you , Mom . " " Me too , " I said . " Bud , you come . Daniel , you and Janie stay here with Daddy . " She glanced at her hair in the mirror and got out , smoothing her skirt . I had often seen our mother rise to one occasion or the other , but I 've never seen her rise as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all those troopers and stood answering their questions as if she had practiced for just such an occasion .
