<p> BEST BET <p> BEARS AT RAIDERS <p> Time : 3:15 p.m. , Fox-32 . Line : Bears by 3 1/2 . Total : 38 . <p> Records ( overall/ATS ) : Bears 3-5/2-6 ; Raiders 2-6/3-5 . <p> - - - <p> Jerry Angelo and Lovie Smith were the last ones to know that Rex Grossman was n't their quarterback . So maybe it 's not such a surprise that they do n't get it  --  the Bears have taken a huge credibility hit in 2007 . <p> This is n't just a team that 's 3-5 . It 's a team that has lost its identity and direction . Pro Football Weekly is n't the only one wondering about Lovie Smith . <p> The Super Bowl loss . The Lovie contract stalemate . The failure to allow their best quarterback to compete for the starting job in training camp . Franchising their best linebacker . Lance Briggs taking the Devon exit on the Edens . <p> The Brian Griese mea culpa . Ignoring Brian Urlacher 's bizarre and inexplicable treatment of the local media . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times for 63 yards , passing 40 times and losing at home . It adds up to a significant erosion of credibility . <p> The question is n't how Angelo is going to address the quarterback situation . It 's what makes you think : Can he do anything about it ? <p> Sunday , the Bears have a chance to restore some faith . They 've had two weeks to scout themselves , rededicate their players to fundamentals and prepare for an opponent whose weakness is their supposed strength . The Raiders are allowing an NFL-worst 5.1 yards per carry . The last five featured backs the Raiders have faced have exceeded their season average by 70 percent or more , with four of them more than doubling their season average . That should put Benson in the 100-to-150-yard range today . If not , he wo n't be the only one taking the heat . <p> Best Bet pick : Raiders 23 , Bears 13 . <p> THE EXPERTS <p> Best bet in all caps .

So I stand corrected . The Lions are the sturdiest house of cards in the NFL  --  better than I think , but not as good as they think .
