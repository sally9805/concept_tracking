Headnote Your preference counts in breast- and prostate-cancer screening . A 52-year-old man wonders whether he should undergo prostate-cancer screening , because he has heard that testing may be more likely to lead to unnecessary , potentially harmful treatment than to save his life . And his 47-year-old wife is rethinking her annual mammogram , now that the influential American College of Physicians has questioned the benefit of routine breast-cancer screening for women her age . But their doctors ca n't , or at least should n't , provide simple or easy answers , because in neither case is the evidence strong enough to justify definitive advice . " As research reveals more about the risks and benefits of treatments and screenings , the more complex , and individual , decisions become , " says Floyd J. Fowler Jr. , Ph.D. , president of the Foundation for Informed Medical Decision Making in Boston . " Health-care choices should reflect not only the latest evidence , but also your own priorities , " Fowler says . Here 's how to make informed , personalized decisions about breast- and prostate-cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ARE A-CHANGING " Doctors will increasingly become interpreters of information rather than decision makers , " predicts Len Lichtenfeld , M.D. , deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society in Atlanta . That puts the onus on patients to inform themselves about complex health issues . Of course , consumers get information from lots of places these days-the Internet , magazines , even advertisements . But it 's hard to know how reliable that information is . And even the best sources rarely provide information tailored to your unique needs . So do n't think that you can , or should , figure it out all by yourself . A good doctor , and good communication , can help you put the risks and benefits into perspective . ALL THE RIGHT QUESTIONS Here 's what you need to consider : What 's the evidence ? Talk to your doctor about what the research shows and ask about any guidelines from professional organizations or governmental agencies . If the doctor 's advice does n't match what your own research suggests , consider getting a second opinion . What are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The risk of complications from this operation are 1 in 1,000 " is more meaningful than " the risks are small . " And they should be placed in context : Hearing that a medication halves your risk of stroke is more impressive than knowing that it reduces your risk from 2 percent to 1 percent . How does it apply to me ? Your physician should help you filter the facts and figures through the lens of your age , gender , race , physique , health history , and personal preferences . For example , people with a strong family history of heart disease or certain cancers may need to be tested for those ailments earlier and more often than other people . What are my choices ? A doctor might prescribe a cholesterol-lowering statin , for example , without telling you that a healthy diet and regular exercise can sometimes achieve the same results . Few medical situations have only one option . What might happen if I do nothing ? Deciding against a test or treatment often makes perfect sense . For example , people with back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only if followup tests or worsening symptoms suggest that the condition is progressing . What does your gut say ? Just because a doctor recommends a certain test or treatment does n't mean that you have to have it . That 's especially true when the evidence is unclear , as in the case , for example , of treating hepatitis C or thyroid cancer . Do you need a mammogram ? In April 2007 the influential American College of Physicians challenged the need for routine mammograms for women in their 40s . And many experts question the need for manual exams in women of any age and the value of certain new breastimaging technologies . For women between the ages of 50 and 70 , there 's good evidence that mammograms every year or two save lives . Regular screening probably benefits women over age 70 too . But some experts worry that uncertainty about the tests ' benefits for younger women will scare off some older women . That 's unfortunate . If you 're over 50 , get an annual mammogram . THE 40S DILEMMA For women in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They are much less likely than older women to develop breast cancer and , when they do , the greater density of their breasts makes it harder to spot tumors . As a result , mammography for them may produce less benefit . And that can make the test 's risks-mainly false alarms and the anxiety and biopsies they trigger-particularly disturbing . On the other hand , breast cancer in younger women tends to be especially aggressive ; for women who have such tumors detected early , the benefit is immeasurable . The higher your risk of breast cancer , based on factors such as how old you were when you started menstruating , the number of children you have had , and whether you have a personal or family history of the disease , the more sensible testing in your 40s becomes . To assess your risk , take the National Cancer Institute 's self-test at www.cancer.gov /bcrisktool/ . But most cancers occur in women with no known risk factors , so for them the decision often boils down to individual preferences and priorities . " For women very worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing something , " says Scott Ramsey , M.D. , Ph.D. , director of the Cancer Prevention Clinic at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle . " Still , the potential benefit is modest , and women must be mentally prepared for the possibility of a false-positive result . " OTHER SCREENING TESTS Here 's our advice on manual exams and new breast-imaging technologies . Manual exams . A 2007 review concluded that breast self-exams have no overall benefit and may make needless biopsies more likely . That 's probably because women often confuse normal breast-tissue fluctuations with more worrisome changes . Our consultants say that women should still be familiar with the terrain of their breasts and report any lumps or changes to their physician . If you find regular self-checks reassuring , talk with your doctor about the proper timing and technique for the exams . Similarly , there 's little evidence that manual exams by doctors or nurses catch more cancers than mammography alone . Women who opt for that test may want to consider having it done before their mammogram so that the radiologist will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hoped that software used to scan digital mammograms would detect more cancers . But an April 2007 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that the technology only increased the number of false positives , causing more needless biopsies . Digital mammography itself , however , does offer some advantages over traditional X-rays , since it exposes women to less radiation and can provide clearer images . That may lead to a more accurate diagnosis for high-risk women in their 40s and those with dense breasts.Whether you undergo standard or digital mammography , look for a radiologist who devotes about 50 percent of his or her time to breast imaging . Breast MRI . A July 2007 analysis concluded that among women in their 40s who have a family history of the disease , magnetic resonance imaging plus mammography is nearly three times more likely to detect a cancer than mammography alone . But adding MRI may also cause 16 more false positives for every additional 10 cancers found . That trade-off may be worthwhile only for women with a strong family history of breast or ovarian cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need a PSA test ? Debate over the value of the prostatespecific antigen blood test continues to rage , for two main reasons . Researchers still do n't know for certain that routine testing saves lives , and many PSAdetected cancers are unaggressive . Yet their detection usually leads to surgery or radiation treatment , both of which cause impotence or incontinence as a side effect in many men . As a result , the American Cancer Society , the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force , and most other medical organizations simply advise men to discuss the pros and cons of the blood test with their doctors . Unfortunately , research suggests that many doctors routinely recommend the PSA test , offering little more than a cursory description of its pros and cons . Yet a November 2007 review of 18 trials involving more than 6,000 men found that patients who get a complete and balanced picture of the test 's advantages and disadvantages often decide against it . Men in the study who had information from a variety of reliable brochures , videos , Web sites , and other sources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just talked with their doctors . Here 's information that can help you have an informed discussion with your doctor . THE PROS The PSA test remains the best available tool to detect prostate cancer-which kills more men in the U.S. each year than any malignancy other than lung cancer - in its earliest , most curable , stage . And the overall death rate from the malignancy has dropped slightly since the test 's introduction in the early 1990s . Finally , several techniques , described in the accompanying box , may make the test more accurate . THE CONS Randomized clinical trials that compare men who take the test with those who do n't have not yet been completed . So it 's still unclear if the slight mortality decline seen in population studies stems from the test , improved treatments , chance , or other factors , such as changing dietary or exercise patterns . Moreover , the PSA test often triggers false alarms that lead to costly , uncomfortable , and anxiety-producing biopsies . Indeed , elevated PSA levels-generally more than 4 nanograms per milliliter ( ng/mL ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . " We have patients in a no-man 's land where they have high PSA counts , but multiple negative biopsies for cancer , " says Mary McNaughton-Collins , M.D. , an associate professor of medicine at Harvard who has studied prostate cancer screening . While some men may be reassured by remaining vigilant about their health , others find it so stressful that " they wish they had not had the test in the first place , " McNaughton-Collins says . And some research suggests that such anxiety can trigger other problems , such as impaired sexual function . Finally , even when a biopsy does confirm cancer , it 's usually hard to know for certain whether it 's an aggressive or slow-moving tumor , and thus whether treatment is really necessary . And because relatively harmless cancers far outnumber the aggressive variety , many people who seek treatment and experience side effects from it might have done just as well with watchful waiting . YOUR CALL Most white , Hispanic , and Asian men under age 50 and black men under age 45 do n't need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of having the disease ; neither do men who have a life expectancy of less than about 10 years , since the cancer usually progresses so slowly that they are more likely to die with the disease than of it . For others , the decision depends mainly on personal preference . If you are more concerned about the possibility of needless treatment and complications than the idea of living with an undetected cancer , you can reasonably skip the PSA test . Some men , particularly those with a family history of the disease , may feel more comfortable learning when they have cancer and getting it treated if they do . Note that most men age 50 and over should also consider having a periodic digital rectal exam , in which a doctor inserts a gloved finger into the rectum . Although there 's no proof that the test saves lives , prostate cancers detected that way tend to be more advanced and thus are more likely to require treatment . And the test can probably help detect rectal cancers as well . Sidebar Should women reconsider hormones ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a landmark trial showed that hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) increased the risk of several diseases . But a recent reanalysis of that data , along with growing enthusiasm in some quarters for low doses or " bioidentical " formulations of the hormone , are prompting some doctors and patients to reconsider . Is it safe ? The new analysis suggested that the risk of heart disease from HRT was limited to women who started it after age 60 or 10 years after the start of menopause . But the other risks-of breast cancer , stroke , blood clots in the lungs , and possibly dementia-remain . And a separate European study that followed almost 1 million postmenopausal women for up to seven years found that HRT slightly raised the risk of ovarian cancer . So our consultants say that HRT should generally still be reserved for the shortterm relief of severe menopausal symptoms , notably hot flashes , vaginal dryness , painful sex , and frequent urinary tract infections . Estrogen for menopause symptoms Women who have a history of blood clots , stroke , heart or liver disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not good candidates for HRT . Others should select the form of HRT likely to best relieve their symptoms . Those bothered by vaginal symptoms , for example , may want to try an estrogensecreting vaginal ring , a vaginal cream , or a vaginal tablet . For hot flashes and other symptoms , there are several choices , including gels , patches , or sprays , all of which are applied to the skin , and low-dose pills . Some experts think that the transdermal products may be slightly safer , as the drugs bypass the liver . Others believe that the very-low-dose pills now used are at least as safe . For now , it probably makes sense to opt for the form you feel most comfortable with . Whichever you take , use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time possible . And taper off after a year or two to see if you still need the hormone . The bioidentical debate The Food and Drug Administration has now approved several estrogen products that , unlike previously available forms , are chemically identical to the hormone made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gels , pills , patches , rings , and sprays , contain a form of estrogen called estradiol . While no long-term study has yet compared bioidentical and traditional hormones , our consultants say that those newer drugs can be reasonable choices . However , they are leery of another form of so-called bioidentical therapy-custom-mixed recipes that physicians prescribe based on hormone levels in a woman 's saliva-for several reasons . Saliva testing has not been proved accurate and , in any case , research suggests that menopause symptoms may not be directly related to a woman 's hormone level . Moreover , studies have not yet determined the safety and efficacy of custom-mixed drugs , and the FDA does not monitor the preparations for purity or potency . Finally , insurance may not cover the cost of those medications . Sidebar Good communication with your doctor can clarify the risks and benefits of tests . Sidebar Improve your PSA test The standard recommendation for men who do opt for the prostatespecific antigen test is to get screened every one to two years . But results from a large European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many cancers . The following steps may help make the test more accurate : * Abstain from ejaculating two days before testing , as that could cause a falsely elevated reading . * Remind your doctor if you are taking the drugs dutasteride ( Avodart ) or finasteride ( Propecia , Proscar , and generic ) since both drugs can lower PSA levels . * Tell your doctor if you take any dietary supplement . For example , while saw palmetto does not appear to affect PSA levels , other herbs marketed for prostate health might . * Ask that your blood sample be sent to the same lab each time . * Get your blood drawn before the digital rectal exam , since stimulating the gland may temporarily boost PSA . Before you get a biopsy If you have a high PSA level , talk with your doctor about the following factors , which might affect your need for a biopsy : * Your " PSA velocity " and " percentfree PSA . " A rapidly rising PSA level-more than 0.5 over 18 months for men with an initial PSA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an initial reading over 4-may be more likely to indicate cancer . And men with prostate cancer tend to have more PSA bound to certain proteins in the blood . So a biopsy may be necessary only when the percentage of unbound , or free , PSA is below 25 percent . * Your age and gland size . Some doctors raise the PSA threshold for older men and lower it for younger ones because PSA levels tend to rise with age . And since large glands normally produce more PSA , a high level may be more worrisome in a small gland as determined by the digital exam or ultrasound. * Infection . A high PSA can stem from an infection , and readings may return to normal after you take antibiotics . * A repeat test . An elevated PSA may reflect a lab error or a temporary rise stemming from inflammation . So it often makes sense to undergo biopsy only when a second test , taken three to four months later , confirms the increase . <p>           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
