Inquisitive , formidable and endangered , giant otters are luring tourists by the thousands to Brazil 's unspoiled , biodiverse waterscape <p> <p> BLOODCURDLING CRIES SHATTER THE STILLNESS OF dusk in the Pantanal , in southern Brazil , as if a pack of wolves were gathering for a hunt . The urgent yelping silences all other wildlife : the squawking of hyacinth macaws , the grunting of caimans , the growl of an ever-elusive jaguar . Even my guide , Senhor Japao , cuts the outboard of our aluminum-hulled skiff , and we drift silently on the barely perceptible current of the Rio Negro . <p> Under the dome of fading sky , the river cuts a twisting avenue through the forest . And then we come upon what we have journeyed here to see : a mob of agile , seal-like animals , twisting and dodging through the water , leapfrogging one another , overtaking our boat easily and casting curious but hurried glances at us . <p> " Lobos de agua ? " I whisper to Senhor Japao in Spanish , his and my second language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ariranhas , " he says , using their Portuguese name . <p> The giant river otters pass around the next bend in the river , and their caterwauling reaches a crescendo . There are violent splashes , followed by the sound of large bodies crashing through the undergrowth . Then , the droning of insects and the chatter of birds resume . With a casual slap , Senhor Japao dispatches the first mosquito , of the evening . The ariranhas have crossed to an oxbow lake , he says ; perhaps they have a den there . We , too , must return home to the ranch , or fazenda , also called the Rio Negro . He fires up the outboard and makes a swooping turn , racing the darkness . <p> This is my first day in the Pantanal , the world 's largest freshwater wetlands , which spreads across 54,000 square miles of Brazil , Bolivia and Paraguay . In Brazil alone , the Pantanal covers an area the size of Kansas  --  an Everglades-like waterscape of oxbow lakes , woodlands and savannas-that harbors the highest concentration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fazenda Rio Negro is a cluster of terra-cotta-roofed structures built around a whitewashed 1920s mansion with spacious verandas and a tiny family chapel . The 19,400-acre fazenda is one of about 1,100 large cattle ranches spread across the Pantanal . Even with these livestock operations , this area of Brazil remained almost unknown until about a decade ago . Then , in 1994 , the area became the setting for Pantanal , a Brazilian soap opera whose beautiful heroine had the curious habit of morphing into a female jaguar . Set against stunning vistas and a superabundance of wildlife , the program proved an instant hit , and the Pantanal was " discovered . " One by one , the fazendas became centers for a lucrative trade in ecotourism . In 2000 , the onetime backwater welcomed a million such visitors , who came to view its rich biodiversity on Serengeti-style safaris . International environmental organizations also began to take note of the Pantanal . In May 1999 , Conservation International ( CI ) , a nonprofit Washington-based environmental group , bought the Fazenda Rio Negro and , with the help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research center for ecologists . <p> Here I meet 27-year-old Helen Waldemarin , an enthusiastic graduate student in ecology at Rio de Janeiro State University who is surveying the otter population for CI and is dressed in python-skin fatigues . She has invited me along on one of her excursions . " Ecotourism can be a double-edged sword , " she tells me the day before we are to set out . " It can help conservation or disrupt it . " <p> WITH A FOOTPRINT THAT IS OFTEN BIGGER THAN A HUMAN hand , the giant river otter is the largest of the world 's 13 otter species , reaching six feet in length and weighing up to 70 pounds . A giant otter reclining on a riverside log , its powerful hind legs giving its body the shape of a sidelong question mark , is as regal , and as prepossessing , as any cheetah or tiger . After the jaguar , the giant otter is South America 's largest and most capable predator . But unlike the jaguar  --  and all other otters as well  --  it lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1978 , a group of giant otters attacked a Braslia policeman at the city 's zoo . The off-duty sergeant tried to rescue a child who had fallen into an enclosure containing an otter family and pups . ( He died of infections caused by their bites . The child survived . ) The widely publicized incident led to a popular belief in Brazil that giant otters can attack and capsize a canoe and tear its occupants to pieces , though no such thing has ever happened . <p> Last year , the highly mobile otters built a den right across the river from the fazenda 's buildings , but the animals have since moved . Waldemarin is not sure whether activity at the ranch caused them to leave . In any case , they often come back , patrolling their territory . " We begin looking for their dens bright and early in the morning , " she briefs me . To maximize observation time and reduce disturbance , we will travel to our locations before dawn and return well after sundown . I learn that the job of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sleep deprivation . <p> By first light , Waldemarin and I , with Senhor Japao at the helm of our small boat , are already puttering over the Rio Negro 's olive green water , a highway that meanders through a mosaic of ponds and lakes , each teeming with fish of many species . Waldemarin explains that the otters maintain a network of dens , camps and resting places that they visit and dean regularly . Senhor Japao is expert at spotting the otters ' entrances , even though they are often disguised by overhanging vegetation . The entrance tunnel , often 15 feet long , leads to a grand chamber with a floor area the size of a suburban living room , large enough to accommodate an otter family . He nudges the boat into a steep , crumbling clay bank , striated with vertical claw marks where the otters had dearly climbed out of the water . Senhor Japao points to a dark opening the size of a squashed car tire just below the lip of the bank . The mud around the entrance is still wet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes a snort , and we all spin around in the canoe to see a streamlined head , whiskered like a bottlebrush , cutting an arrowhead wake . Snorting in what sounds like agitation , the otter stops to investigate us , craning its head , standing up in the water for a better view . Waldemarin looks for the cream-colored markings on its neck that are as individual as a human 's fingerprints , but before she can make an identification , the giant otter ducks , dives and disappears . <p> Waldemarin tells me that the usually inquisitive otters are acting uncharacteristically wary ; soon we find out why . At the entrance to another den , Senhor Japao points out a log that , at closer examination , turns out to be a large caiman , a species of crocodile . " The otters must already have cubs , " Waldemarin says . The caiman has been lured by the promise of food . <p> Big caimans are not the otters ' only predator . Their velvety chocolate-brown fur is among the finest in the world , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decades of relentless and uncontrolled hunting by man . <p> Throughout their original range , from the Orinoco basin in Colombia and Venezuela to the Pantanal and northern Argentina , the curious otters , often approaching canoes in entire families , were an easy target for hunters who sought their pelts . <p> Official statistics only hint at the true extent of the slaughter : during a seven-year period in the 1960s , Brazil exported more than 40,000 pelts . But these figures do n't account for a thriving illegal trade or the fact that more specimens were killed than recovered . Alarmed by the rapid disappearance of the giant otters , several South American countries granted them legal protection in the mid-1970s . By then , the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species ( CITES ) had outlawed trade in otter skins , but clandestine commercial hunting continued , particularly in remote areas of the Amazon and Venezuela , with most pelts smuggled out via Colombia . As the numbers of giant otters in the wild plummeted , the price for their skins increased , and by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In 1979 , Venezuela was the last country to ban the hunting of otters . Since then , the animals have returned in significant numbers  --  to about 5,000  --  though they remain on the endangered list of the World Conservation Union ( WCU ) . <p> Giant otters live in locally dense populations scattered through pockets of remote habitat . Outside the Pantanal , their other stronghold is Manu Biosphere Reserve , a river basin the size of Massachusetts , in southeastern Peru . Here the Frankfurt Zoological Society has coordinated a number of systematic field studies over the past dozen years . <p> Martha Brecht Munn , a WCU biologist , observed a family of otters in Peru hunting an anaconda , among the world 's largest snakes . " Two or more otters would bite and hold the snake at different places on its body , " she wrote in Animal Kingdom magazine . ' They would then thrash it against a fallen tree trunk and engage in what looked like a tug-of-war with an animated fire hose . " In a group , they could also make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  skull , bones and all  --  in 45 minutes . Most of the time , however , giant otters prefer fish . Brecht Munn wrote that they seem to hunt together as much for camaraderie as to subdue large prey . <p> She also described some cubs ' first swimming lessons : " When they were about two weeks old , their parents carried them outside one by one ... and dropped them into the water at the den entrance . The cubs were about the size of a loaf of bread , their eyes still closed , and they bobbed about helplessly . " All the adult otters circled the cubs to protect them from loitering caimans . <p> ANOTHER PREDAWN START IN THE PANTANAL , AND THIS TIME I 'm searching for otters with Marion Kallerhoff , a South African wildlife specialist here to work with scientists studying jaguars , hyacinth macaws and giant otters . As we push off into the dark water , I scan the banks with my flashlight ; the eyes of caimans light up like reflective highway markers . After an hour of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the river from the most likely otter dens , to await the daylight . The foghorn-like humming of curassow birds begins to echo from the forest , and jabiru storks cross against the gray sky like small aircraft . But first up are the mosquitoes . Because otters have an excellent sense of smell , Kallerhoff suggested we not use any insect repellent . Now I cringe against the onslaught . Then , all of sudden , I forget the insects ' annoying whine Across the river , a whiskery face pops up with a nostril-clearing snort , then another face appears , followed by yet another . A family of giant otters has just emerged from its den and begins to feed with the splashy exuberance of kids in a backyard swimming pool . I ease my canoe back into the river , quietly paddle upstream , then drift down , still as a log . <p> The otters dive eagerly into the shallow water , churning twisting trajectories that trace their frantic underwater chases . I 'd read that biologists in eastern Colombia have observed giant river otters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' water antics appear dolphinlike , until , that is , they surface , roll over on their backs , grab fish with their webbed paws and wolf them down . <p> Crunch ! One otter snaps the backbone of a piranha with its powerful molars while another torpedoes past my canoe to emerge with a stubby two-foot-long pintado catfish flapping in its mouth . Then , as if on cue , all this hyperactive commotion stops , and the otters launch into some impromptu landscaping around the den . They huff and sniffle , rearranging the lianas , or vines , and tear at a floating raft of water hyacinth . Then the merry troupe is off again , snorting and splashing , playing what seems like an energetic game of tag as they head down the river and around the bend . <p> Kallerhoff catches up to scold me about getting too close . " In Manu Biosphere Reserve in Peru , the giant otters stopped breeding because boatloads of tourists were forever invading their space , " she says . These otters did n't appear stressed , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mollify Kallerhoff . But I can see that keeping tourists safe distances from these appealing creatures will be a monumental challenge . <p> Other threats to the giant otters ' well-being are more insidious . The Pantanal is like an immense sponge that soaks up water from surrounding uplands and thus acts as a giant settling pond for waterborne pollution . Biologists fear that levels of mercury , for instance , may be rising . <p> Much of Brazil and its neighbors are still in the grips of the search for El Dorado  --  gold . It is largely a quest of small-scale miners , but their collecting efforts add up . " Just within the Amazon basin , some 1.2 million people extract roughly 200 tons of gold a year , " says Frank Hajek , who co-manages the Frankfurt Zoological Society 's giant otter project in Peru , " and the production of each gram of gold requires one to four grams of mercury . " Up to 40 percent of this mercury escapes into the environment . An estimated 128 tons a year leaches into the Amazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the nearby gold mining areas shows that mercury levels in fish are too high for human consumption , " Hajek says . " At the same time , analysis of the Peruvian giant otters ' scat feces shows no traces of methylmercury and , since the otters eat primarily fish , this means that mercury must be accumulating in their bodies in toxic concentrations . " Hajek has n't yet been able to sample otter tissue to prove his theory . But he fears that many otters will die from mercury poisoning unless something is done . The solution , he says , is relatively simple . Miners could heat their ore in a closed vessel , capturing most of the mercury . But miners dislike this process  --  it produces a discolored lump of gold that fetches lower prices . Hajek says that giant river otters are also feeling the squeeze from ever diminishing rain forests . Although the home range of a typical otter family is only about 270 acres , they need thousands of acres to thrive . Young otters leaving their family often travel long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitat , which usually includes a shallow lake , an abundance of fish and high banks in which to tunnel . <p> One biologist has estimated the Pantanal 's giant otter population at a relatively healthy 500 , but there have been no measurements of mercury levels in the otters here . On my way out of Rio Negro , I take in one last view of their home from the window of the Cessna . In the course of a half hour , I spot flocks of spoonbills , egrets and storks , hundreds of caimans and capybaras , a lone swamp deer and tapirs . But the future of this abundance is far from certain . Despite a World Wildlife Fund initiative that saw UNESCO declare more than 96,000 square miles of the area a Biosphere Reserve in November 2000 , only about 3 percent of the Pantanal is actually protected . The rest is in the hands of ranchers torn between development and conservation . <p> Recently , Conservation International of Brazil proposed creating a network of biodiversity corridors  --  continuous and unfenced strips of wild habitat that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surrounding cerrado uplands . These corridors , carved mostly through private properties , would either be left uncultivated or farmed in an environmentally and otter-friendly manner . It sounds like a good idea : the ranchers would gain tax breaks and tourism opportunities , and the animals would get the room they need . <p> " The giant otters are perhaps our most captivating animals , ' biologist Reinaldo Lourival , who leads the CI Pantanal branch , told me . " They can be easily glimpsed by visitors and so have become an umbrella species for conservation in the Pantanal . If we can ensure an adequate habitat for giant otters , much of our amazing biodiversity will be taken care of as well .
