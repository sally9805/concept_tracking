When it comes to marriage , I 'm like that kid in The Sixth Sense . Everywhere I look , I see wedded people . But when I gaze upon newlyweds , I do n't see hearts and flowers ; I see law firms banging out contracts in an effort to inoculate both husband and wife against the death of love and the inevitable pain , greed and bad behavior that follow . According to Arlene Dubin , a divorce lawyer in New York City and author of Prenups for Lovers , about 20% of marrying couples pursue prenuptial agreements , outlining everything from how assets should be divided in case of divorce to how often a couple will go on vacation or have sex . <P> Couples who missed the chance to negotiate their divorce ahead of time can now develop property settlements after their wedding day . It 's done with a " postnup "  --  a legal agreement that spells out how assets will be divided in case of divorce or death . Those who most often pursue postnups do so as the result of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrival of an inheritance . With more couples blending families , a postnup can mandate that a mother 's assets pass directly to her biological children , not the stepkids . Or a husband can cap the total amount his wife would receive from his business assets in case of divorce . Postnups can also protect one spouse from financial obligations flowing from a legal judgment against the other 's business . <P> Dubin says she would rather help couples negotiate settlements during the marriage than after it is already breaking up . But she warns that postnups may be held to a higher standard than prenups by state courts because of the possibility that the more vulnerable spouse has been coerced into signing . Minnesota , for instance , allows postnups only if each spouse is worth at least $1.2 million and the couple stay married for two years after signing . <P> Neil Warren , marriage counselor , author of Finding the Love of Your Life and happy veteran of a 42-year marriage , told me that the only thing he likes about postnups is that they get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he says , " must mean that at least one spouse believes that the marriage is n't working . " <P> Maybe it takes a divorced person like me to be a true softy on marriage : even after talking at length with lawyers about postnups , I still want to believe that a couple can share their assets and have faith in a married future , financial complications and all . Couples should fully disclose their assets and debts , discuss and even write down their goals , but then they should stick the piece of paper in a drawer and concentrate on their lives . Without lawyers . <P> For more on postnups , visit
