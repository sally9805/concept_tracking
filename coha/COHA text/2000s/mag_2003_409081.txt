Once upon a time and today , a toy store overlooked the Willamette River , and in that store hung a stuffed calico moon named Gilbert . Gilbert had rhinestone eyes and velvet patches in all the colors of the rainbow . He was the most beautiful moon anyone could imagine , and customers remarked on his appearance whenever they visited the store . But no one ever bought Gilbert , despite the good opinions of him . So he hung for a year above the stuffed animals . Gilbert sighed as his second Christmas drew near and one by one the toys disappeared . " It does n't seem fair that I should never have a home , " he said , and his rhinestone eyes sparkled as though filled with tears . But no one noticed . No one pitied him , though he continued to be admired . One night , a few days before Christmas , the custodian entered the shop and , seeing that there was little left to dust or arrange , left his trash barrel and disappeared for a cup of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the collection of debris the shoppers had left behind . There were paper cups and bags , and soft drink cans piled high , as well as a good supply of abandoned newspapers . Goodness , thought Gilbert , what a lot of waste these humans leave behind ! The calico moon was deep in thought when the string that secured him to the ceiling broke and he fell with a plop into the barrel below . Oh dear , thought Gilbert . What 's to come of me ? Soon the shop door opened again , and Gilbert could hear the slow steps of the custodian . As the man wheeled his cart from the room without noticing Gilbert inside , the calico moon sighed . " Now I will never find a home . " A single street lamp glowed in the alley . Gilbert could tell it was a crisp winter night because , overhead , between the shadows of the buildings , a multitude of stars twinkled . Despite his trouble , the stuffed ornament could hardly contain his wonder . " There 's the moon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , his velvet swatches seemed none too fine . " I am a foolish creature , " he admitted , " thinking myself as grand , when I 'm only made of patches ! " // // Gilbert lay in the trash barrel for some time before he heard footsteps . His heart leaped as a voice muttered , " Where are you , my pretties ? Come out , come out . " Then a hand descended and began to stir the contents . " There 's one ! " The voice cracked with pleasure as the fingers discovered a bottle long before emptied of its contents . " That 's very nice for a start ! " said the voice to the hand . " I wonder if there 's another ? " And for a second time , the fingers descended , dislodging enough debris for Gilbert to see the face of the old woman . Her gray hair was squashed into a cap , but her eyes , though clouded , seemed merry . " What 's this ? " she gasped , finding Gilbert among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then she turned the little moon round and round , examining it until Gilbert grew dizzy . " Perfect , " she concluded . Gilbert traveled with the old woman for two days , buried in the pocket of her woolly skirt . From time to time , she 'd pull him out and gaze at him , repeating , " Such a Christmas ! Such a Christmas ! " Gilbert was certain that the creature was mad . Still , it was nice to be admired and , besides , the little moon was enjoying the adventure . Though he could not always see , he heard much . And the sounds of the real world were so different from those of the toy shop . Often , they were frightening . " Get out of here , you old crone ! This is my corner ! " someone shouted one day . On another day , a younger voice snapped , " Do n't give her anything , Mother . She wants to live like that or she 'd work . " And there were other noises , too-car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why do n't you look where you 're going , you old fool ? " And always , in the midst of this turmoil , he could hear the footsteps of shoppers , scurrying like moles , unmindful of surrounding events . By this and the crackling of their packages , he knew that Christmas was near . Soon bells would ring in the Old Church Tower , " Peace on Earth , goodwill toward men . " // " Move along , Agnes . You do n't want to be out on a night like this . There 's a frost coming . " " I 'm on my way , Officer Ryan . Do n't you worry . And a merry Christmas to you . " " And to you , Agnes . And to you . " " Such a nice policeman , " muttered Agnes , the bag lady , as she shuffled toward the bridge . " Wish I had something to give him . Hard to be working Christmas Eve . Still , " she patted the bulge in her skirt where Gilbert rested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Christmas . The best ever . " How dark it was under the bridge ! A few fires blazed in rusty cans , and these cast shadows on the columns , which the drifters called home . Gilbert could see them crouched against the pillars and could hear them whisper to one another . He thought he had journeyed to a distant land , one drained of color-and of joy . Surely , he thought , these are ghosts . Yet , their welcome seemed cheery enough . " Is that you , Agnes ? Come over by the fire . I had a good day . Enough for bread and tea . Would you like a cup ? " " Have you seen Chelsea ? " Agnes replied . Her voice was so full of joy that she sounded half her age of seventy years . " Over there . " Her companion pointed . " Another bad day . No one 's looking to hire at Christmas . I do n't know how much longer the poor woman can go on . " " But is Chelsea with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course she is . Where else would her daughter be ? ' ' ' Agnes shuffled toward the woman and child who were huddled under a column . " Evening , Mrs. Caullier . Hello , Chelsea . Are you excited about Christmas ? " " Please , Agnes . Do n't be putting ideas into her head . I 've already explained that Christmas wo n't be coming this year . My daughter 's a big girl . She understands . " Agnes looked into the eyes of the child and knew she did not understand . " It 's been a rough day , has it , Mrs. Caullier ? " " No more than the day before and the one before that . I do n't think we 'll ever get out from under this bridge . Never ! " " Oh , you must n't give up hoping . " " I do n't believe in miracles , Agnes . Look at you . How long have you been here ? " A stiff breeze blew over the river and swirled in gusts among the pillars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little body tremble . " I do n't believe in fairy tales , " she snapped . " I ca n't . " " That 's where you 're wrong , Mrs. Caullier . Yes , siree ! That 's where you 're wrong . Now it just so happens that Santa and I are personal friends and ... " " Agnes , if you stir up this child ... " " And like I said , you 've got to believe . Do you believe in him , Chelsea ? " The little girl looked bewildered , but slowly , despite her mother 's frown , nodded . " I believe , " she whispered . " Good , " the old woman grinned , " because he believes in you . Look here . Look what he asked me to bring . " And saying this , she reached into the folds of her woolen skirt and brought out a crumpled wad of tissue paper . " For you , " she said , kissing the little girl . Chelsea hesitated . " Oh , go ahead , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Whatever it is , take it . It 's more than I can give . " The child took the package . " Thank you , " she said , her eyes round with wonder . Then slowly , carefully she unfolded the tissue-and , to her great joy , discovered the moon ! Before she could examine her treasure , someone cried out . " The cops ! They 're here ! " A halo of lights flashed red and white and blue in the underworld , blinding the inhabitants . An old woman wrung her hands and wailed . " Whatever will become of us ? This is our home ! " Two men who tried to run were stopped by the stern voice of one of the officers . " Settle down ! There 's nothing to worry about . We have n't come to trouble anyone . " // Agnes knew the voice well . " That you , Officer Ryan ? " " Evening , Agnes . You keeping warm ? " " Doing my best , but these old bones , not much fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the officer replied . ' ' ' And food and hot coffee . The precinct 's been planning this for weeks as a surprise , I guess we succeeded . We did n't mean to frighten anyone . Sorry . We just wanted to share the spirit of Christmas . Will you join me in a cup , Agnes ? " " I will " the old woman crooned . " And thank you kindly for it . We all do . " Then she looked round and saw the silhouettes of her companions cringing in the light . " What 's the matter with you people ? Have you lost your senses ? Where are your manners ? It 's a cold night and these men and women have taken the trouble to bring hot food . The least we can do is share it with them ! What do you say ? " // For a moment , nothing stirred , not even the smallest branch on a nearby tree , or the papers strewn along the asphalt . Nothing . The world on that frosty night hung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painted by some moody artist . Then , something magic happened under the bridge , there , where men and women of differing ages , color and walks of life sat down to break bread . The wonder of it filtered into the night air until it reached the cars speeding overhead . " Listen , Mary . Do you hear that ? " said a driver . " There 's a choir singing . But where could it be ? " On Christmas Eve , Chelsea Caullier went to bed without hunger and fell asleep under a warm blanket . Beside her lay the calico moon with rhinestone eyes that sparkled all the night , for the little toy could not sleep . He had come so far , learned so much , and now he knew what Christmas meant . It is n't about gifts , really . These are only the outward show . Christmas is about feelings , caring . Christmas is about love . The calico moon snuggled in Chelsea 's arms and looked happily into the silver sky . " Thank you , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd found a home . // <p>
