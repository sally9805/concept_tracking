<p> The difference between entertaining TV and good government Re : " Reality TV : Council in action , " June 17 Scene feature . <p> It was an interesting , almost theatrical attempt by TV critic Joanne Ostrow to produce reviews of the Denver City Council members from their " performances " at meetings as seen through the eyes of a Channel 8 camera . But she seems confused about the difference between good government and good television . <p> Should the members of the Denver City Council be judged on the way they represent the city and their electorate , or should they be more concerned about the way they " perform " and appear to one television critic ? City council meetings , no matter the city , are group efforts at governing with those elected to govern performing , for the most part , without benefit of " acting lessons . " <p> As one who prepares executives to deal with the news media , I will tell you that the " timid presence " ascribed by Ostrow to Councilwoman Jeanne Robb is perceived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anyone who has met Robb knows timid is not her style . True , there are instances during City Council meetings , as there certainly are in the executive offices at the University of Colorado , where speaking without thought is a professional sport , honed to perfection . I , for one , would much prefer to see anyone respond after appropriate and careful thought rather than see them quickly and effectively prove themselves really , really thoughtless and sometimes incredibly stupid . <p> My thought is that , as in the reality of television today , we consider voting Joanne Ostrow off the island for such a slur on governing and those who attempt to govern . Response after thought works much better than " Ready , Fire , Aim . " Better government , not better performances , should always be better television . <p> Robert L.

They feel it is a Democratic scheme to dilute GOP votes . They should be experts on the subject of " schemes " after their attempt at redistricting . <p> Republican state chairman Ted Halaby is n't sure if this new initiative " verges on dirty tricks , but it certainly has a bad odor . " Seems to me that nothing smells half as bad as the Republicans ' failed effort at gerrymandering districts to ensure votes . <p> In fact , reforming the Electoral College , a vestige of colonial America thinking , is a good idea to promote fairness in the political system . The current method is subject to " misfires , " when a popular- vote winner fails to receive a majority of the electoral votes , and " faithless electors " switch their support . <p> Under this outmoded system , only 17 to 21 battleground states decide who wins the White House . Critics believe that abandoning the Electoral College system would make Colorado completely irrelevant , but many of us would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other , better sources for learning about candidates . <p> Who knows ? People might even decide to start voting again if they knew their vote counted . <p> George Brazill , Colorado Springs <p> State 's votes would lose power <p> To those who are signing the petition to divide Colorado 's Electoral College votes , I say congratulations . You have just signed up to substantially reduce the significance of a Coloradan 's vote in the presidential election . <p> Under the current system , the Electoral College ensures that your votes and mine carry as much weight in electing the president as , say , someone from New York or California . You can do the math to show this . But if we go to a popular vote system , then the states with the greatest population will become far more important . Think about it : There are 35 million Californians and only 4.5 million Coloradans . In a popular vote system , who do you think will be more important ? <p> In the long run , policy decisions will be based on the whims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ representatives and senators from states such as ours will have only minimal influence with the president . The needs and welfare of the smaller states will become secondary to the demands of the Californians or New Yorkers . In the end , the one-vote argument is a sophism . It sounds reasonable but has a bitter , rotten core . Do n't be misled . <p> Dan Wistrand , Wheat Ridge <p> All states should divide votes <p> Re : " Electoral vote split bad idea for Colorado , " June 16 editorial . <p> It is hard to imagine more bad logic than The Denver Post demonstrated in its editorial . <p> You write that " the state is certain to become politically irrelevant , " and then proceed to point out that if the initiative to make Colorado 's electoral vote roughly proportional to the popular vote had been in place in 2000 , the president would be Al Gore . That hardly seems irrelevant to me . <p> I suppose you recognized the contradiction in your argument when you went on to point out that if the proportional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outcome would go back to Bush . But why did you stop there ? Why not extend the system to Texas and Florida , which would send the victory back to Gore ? I have not done all the arithmetic , but given that Gore won the national popular vote , I suspect he would be president if all states had a proportional electoral vote system . <p> Bill Astle , Golden <p> Gore would indeed be president <p> The Post 's editorial is misleading and undemocratic . If proportional voting were a feature of the Electoral College , Al Gore would have won the 2000 presidential election . <p> Of course , every state must adopt proportional voting . <p> I can not see why The Denver Post would not support the adoption of a system that would bring more democracy to Colorado - and maybe to other states that might copy our system . The only other way we can get rid of the antiquated Electoral College system is via a constitutional amendment . <p> Ruth S. Hertzberg , Frisco <p> With change comes accountability <p> So The Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a wealthy American citizen , not born in this country , and it 's an unproven system of government . Would The Post have opposed our Founding Fathers 200-plus years ago as well ? They were wealthy people , many born in other countries proposing an unproven system of government that suggested that one person 's vote should actually count towards the candidate they chose . Would The Post call our struggling democracy in the 1700s a " laughable proposal " ? <p> How will government ever become more accountable if citizens do n't create change ? If we wait for our elected officials to create positive change , we 'll wait forever . <p> Look closer at the group we 've sent to Washington lately : George W. Bush ( incompetent bumbler ) , Bill Clinton ( adulterer and liar ) , Ben Nighthorse Campbell ( rule-breaking party changer ) , Marilyn Musgrave ( religious extremist spending tax dollars for self-promotion ) , and Joel Hefley ( career politician who has n't held a real job since the Carter administration ) . If these are the people we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are in trouble . <p> Passing this initiative would be a much-needed first step toward a healthy American democracy . <p> Roland Kuehn , Fort Collins <p> The right direction <p> The Electoral College system does not address the core American value of democracy . Consider the current situation with our neighbors to the north . Wyoming has three electoral votes for about 500,000 people , while we in Colorado , with 4.5 million people ( nine times Wyoming 's population ) , have just nine votes . If we were equally represented in presidential elections , either Colorado would have 27 votes or Wyoming would have only one . <p> Votes are counted only once for every congressperson , senator , mayor or sheriff in this country . At a time when we are preaching democracy all over the world , it is time to bring democratic principles to the presidential election : one person , one vote . While this referendum wo n't immediately correct the underlying problem with the Electoral College system and its patently undemocratic principles , it will serve to point this nation in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dennis R. Chrisbaum , Lakewood <p> Change must be systemwide <p> Re : " Divide electoral votes , " June 18 Reggie Rivers column . <p> Reggie Rivers omits the most important point . The idea is good only if all the states were to do it . If all the Republican-leaning states did it , the Democrats would win every presidential election from now on . <p> If all the Democratic-leaning states did it , the Republicans would win every presidential election from now on . <p> The same thing would happen if most of the states that did it were leaning toward one party . That party would never win another election . <p> James W. Phelps , Aurora <p> Voters should n't be disenfranchised <p> While I live in Kansas , I have watched with interest while Colorado begins to mull the possibility of changing its state constitution to allow the proportional division of Electoral College votes in presidential elections . <p> When one lives in a state such as Kansas that almost always votes for one party over the other , one realizes that those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disenfranchised in presidential elections . Their votes will never count , except in the rare instance that a state goes against its historical inclinations . There is enough voter apathy without furthering the situation by such antiquated practices . <p> I hope that Colorado , and eventually the United States , will get rid of the winner-takes-all system . No citizen should be de facto disenfranchised . <p> Joanna Norris Grimshaw , Goodland , Kan . <p> Bad for U.S. and Mexico <p> Re : " Migrant tide rising on border , " June 20 news story . <p> Mexican immigration to the United States is the perfect solution for those in both countries for whom money is more important than principle . The United States gets cheap , semi-slave immigrant labor , and thus the low prices that everybody wants . Mexico gets excused from its responsibility of providing for its own people . Thus , the Catholic Church need not discourage a burgeoning population that the nation can not sustain , and wealthy aristocratic landowners need not share their inherited land with indigenous peoples - yet they profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . Both governments benefit from , and are responsible for , these violations of human rights . <p> So why should American citizens have any complaints or resistance to Mexican immigration ? Why not go with the flow , since we 're not stemming it anyway ? These immigrants are , for the most part , honest , hard-working people who have nowhere else to go . Never mind that many Americans are out of work because they can not live on the immigrants ' wages , or that caring for a small , destitute nation within our borders compromises our economy , infrastructure and the environment , as well as the security of our borders . <p> By encouraging this trafficking in semi-slave labor just to save a buck , the American people are making a mockery of our so-called sacred honor , and Mexico is making a mockery of its claim to be an independent , self-sufficient nation . <p> Richard Kiefer , Golden <p> Protect contractors ' rights <p> Re : " Contractors in Iraq need strict oversight , " June 20 editorial . <p> The Denver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be controlled . However , the editorial might lead readers to believe contractors have not been answerable to any authority . That is far from correct . <p> As a security contractor who has worked in Iraq and expects to return to Iraq in July , I am fully aware that American and other contract workers are subject to the laws of their home countries . That has been the case for a year , long before the recent hue and cry about abuses in the prison systems in Iraq and Afghanistan.After June 30 , when power is handed over to Iraq , the laws of that country should apply . What we as contract personnel seek is some form of protection of our rights . Most contractors are honest , law-abiding individuals who know better than to engage in the harmful and demeaning practices revealed about the prison systems run by our military in Iraq . <p> Having worked internationally for the past 35 years , either as a U.S. military veteran of Vietnam or as private contractor since retiring from the Army in 1990 , I know that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cruel people who seek retribution for real or imagined reasons . As we continue to participate in positive efforts in a chaotic , confusing and dangerous environment to help rebuild a country torn asunder , we want to ensure our rights are also protected . <p> Tim Pasquarelli , Golden <p> " Just because we can " <p> " Just because I could . " Many Americans associate this phrase with former President Bill Clinton 's excuse for his affair with Monica Lewinsky . <p> Certainly Clinton desecrated the Oval Office , lied to the American public , and caused his wife and daughter great emotional pain . We can and should expect a higher standard of conduct on the part of our presidents . But it 's a little too easy to point a finger at Bill Clinton . A little too easy to feel smug about his philandering . Whether we admit it or not , a lot of us like to point to the flaws of another in order to feel better about ourselves . <p> Have n't we as a country committed a number of immoral acts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us ignore the plight of the 30,000 children on this Earth who will die of malnutrition and preventable disease in the next 24 hours . While these children die from lack of food , I bounce from Atkins to South Beach to Dr. Phil diets because I 've spent decades eating too much - just because I can . <p> And are n't we guilty of immoral acts when we continue to be a throwaway society , leaving landfills overflowing and leaching hazardous chemicals into the earth - just because we can . <p> Americans are both generous and self- serving . And many of us have gotten a little soft around the middle when it comes to self-sacrifice . <p> Admittedly , Clinton 's escapades are better fodder for gossip than turning attention to the real needs of humanity . But I wonder what would happen if those of us with a little extra time or money put efforts into at least one humanitarian concern - just because we can . <p> Valerie P.

This might be believable were it not John Kerry , probably the least electable Democrat the party could nominate .

Otherwise , he 's done . Newspapers such as The Denver Post no longer drive opinion , which is why Republicans are being elected everywhere despite the best efforts of the Old Media . <p> Pat Desrosiers , Denver <p> " Perfect Stepford journalist " <p> Diane Carman lets the citizens of Colorado know what she thinks of them by calling them " perfect Stepford voters .

He 's wondered for years when he would cast a vote that counted in his district 's congressional race . It 's all relative , Diane . <p> Ryan M. Davis , Colorado Springs <p> Do n't forget Mike Miles <p> I was perplexed by Diane Carman 's column . In describing the changing political climate in the state , she referred to every senatorial candidate in the state by name except Mike Miles . <p> Is this a deliberate attempt to minimize the legitimate grass-roots campaign of Miles ? <p> Miles is the candidate who not only speaks out on issues of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quality schools , job creation and equal rights , but has concrete plans on how to accomplish these things . He is also the candidate who got the greatest percentage of votes at the state Democratic assembly . <p> Yes , there is finally a vote that matters . It 's the Democratic primary election on Aug. 10 . In order to vote in the primary , people need to know about both candidates . They need to know that there are two candidates . If the media are n't going to help get information out to voters , the least that can be expected is that it not be a hindrance . <p> Sue Mitrovic , Boulder <p> Libraries valuable to our neighborhoods <p> Re : " Cuts could close 2 libraries ; ' 05 budget scenario targets Cherry Creek , Field branches , " June 18 news story . <p> It astounds me that the Denver City Council and the mayor considered closing the Eugene Field and Ross-Cherry Creek branch libraries as a way to save money . There are few things that are sacrosanct , in terms of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When I go to the library , I see people browsing though the books , children checking them out , students researching , computers in full use . My experience is that the ones I primarily frequent , Eugene Field being one , are usually crowded . Try getting a parking place . I have friendly conversations with librarians and some have become friends . We discuss the books I 'm reading and recommend others . I rarely buy DVDs , books or magazines ; instead , I put holds on materials through my home computer on a variety of topics and check out magazines that have articles I 'm interested in reading . I talk with other patrons as we comment on our choices and give each other spontaneous reviews . I see senior citizens who go in daily to their neighborhood library because they can walk there when they can no longer use a car . They relax , read the paper and visit a little with others . Libraries serve so many purposes . <p> Arlene M. Green , Denver <p> Why not spread branch closures evenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Library system is in a state of crisis . There is no doubt that many branches are suffering due to closures of three days each week . There is no doubt that reductions in hours directly affects the literacy of children and the educational support of students and adults in each neighborhood . Denver Public Library administrators face a difficult task in meeting current budget shortfalls . <p> Library officials have considered closing the Ross-Cherry Creek and Eugene Field branch libraries to solve a potential 2005 budget shortfall . I acknowledge that these libraries are in more affluent areas of Denver , yet their closure would have a dramatic and negative effect upon children and the public in the neighborhoods they serve . Instead of closing any branch altogether , all should branches be subject to the same three-day closures that so many libraries in poorer neighborhoods are currently enduring . <p> While many branches have endured draconian limitations to their hours , the new Schlessman branch in the Lowry neighborhood is open more hours ( 66 each week ) than the Central Library ( 48.5 hours ) . Other library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week , also more than the Central Library . Branches in poorer areas have sharply reduced hours : Ross-Broadway is open 32.5 hours a week ; Athmar Park , 36.5 ; Ford-Warren , 33.5 ; and Valdez-Perry , open a mere 26 hours each week . <p> Closing all branch libraries three days a week would be equitable from a tax perspective , since residents of all of Denver 's neighborhoods are paying to support all our libraries . I believe that most people would readily accept a reduction in days open in exchange for complete closure of their neighborhood branch . <p> Betsy Welty , Denver <p> Editor 's note : Denver Mayor John Hickenlooper announced Wednesday the city will not close any of the Denver Public Library 's branch libraries , as earlier proposed . <p> Student body support <p> Re : " Students : Administrators have lost their integrity , " June 20 Perspective . <p> University of Colorado students Georgina Salomon and Candice Lopez misrepresented the student body 's attitude toward the football recruiting scandal . <p> As a senior at CU , I have noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is unfair to hold the football coach responsible for campuswide partying problems . <p> Although Gary Barnett should have done more to spell out rules regarding recruiting visits to player hosts , this is no reason to fire him . Furthermore , I believe that he is committed to rectifying the problem . <p> In regards to Barnett 's comments about Katie Hnida , he was asked a direct question about her playing ability and answered it honestly . <p> Most of us would rather have honest answers than politically correct ones . If new evidence comes out that Barnett , athletic director Dick Tharp or chancellor Richard Byyny condoned criminal activity , they should be fired . As for now , I ( and a large portion of the student body ) support them and our football team . <p> Eric Robbins , Boulder <p> Male egos out of control <p> Re : " Parent : We stand by Coach Barnett and our team , " June 20 Perspective . <p> I 'm not sure how Patty Klopfenstein , the mother of a University of Colorado football player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for our choices we make as women . Or the implication that since rape accusations are n't provable , they could n't have happened . <p> She claims not to be victim-bashing , but clearly she is doing just that . Where she and all women need to take responsibility as mothers is in teaching our sons that " no " from a woman 's lips means " no . " It is also up to a mother to teach her son that no matter how much alcohol or drugs he or a female companion consumes , he is still responsible for his behavior and will be held accountable for it . <p> The issue in the CU scandal is that male egos are out of control - because everyone treats them as football gods who can do no wrong . <p> Judith Niederquell , South Fork <p> Balance drilling <p> and enviro needs <p> Re : " Listen to public on gas drilling , " June 13 editorial . <p> There is a controversy on gas drilling across the West . There was also a controversy over drilling offshore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus imported oil in the 1980s , oil was relatively plentiful . We declined to drill at home and directed our domestic industry overseas to produce oil from other countries . Today , the U.S. imports more than half of its oil at a price that we all feel is too high . But supply concerns prevail , and we pay $2-plus per gallon of gasoline , resulting in a worsening balance of trade and less cash in our wallets . <p> The West contains seven of the 12 largest U.S. gas fields . These resources produce nearly one-third of the U.S. gas needs . They are profitable above about $3 per MCF ( thousand cubic feet ) with today 's technology . Forcing costly practices upon the industry to protect the environment means less gas will be developed and supplies will fail to meet demand . <p> Two colleagues and I support the Bureau of Land Management in its management of gas resources through Department of Energy-funded research . We seek technologies that may economically minimize development impacts . We know the research findings will be applicable to gas resources @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at fair prices with a diminished environmental impact . But if the public declines to develop gas , as we did with oil , we face dependency on foreign-controlled gas , as well as oil . <p> There must be a balance between development and the environment . The BLM and gas industry are responsive to public concerns . However , they must balance responsiveness relative to ensuring a sufficient supply at a fair price . Compromise and creativity are key . The potential for divisive , gridlocked debate leads us to recall the history of the domestic oil industry and shudder to think that we may have been down this road before . <p> L. Chorn , Golden
