People with MS impact Tysabri recommendation // " It was a really scary experience , but incredibly empowering , " said MRI technologist Barbara Crooks , who was diagnosed with MS eight years ago . Crooks was one of more than three dozen people who testified during the public discussion session of the two-day FDA Advisory Committee meeting on Tysabri that began March 7 , 2006 . " The energy was electrifying , " Crooks said . " There were more than 40 people testifying , and another 200 in the audience . I felt we ( people with MS ) were very well represented . There were nurses , teachers , and doctors . There was a nuclear physicist , a preacher and his wife , countless moms , and the family of Anita Smith , who died from PML . There were representatives of health organizations and advocacy groups . There were people with ' invisible symptoms ' and video testimony from people who were quadriplegic .

In December 2005 , the Society commissioned an independent national survey of more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and choice . Joyce Nelson , president and CEO of the Society , elaborated on the Society 's role : " The FDA 's decision will affect each and every person with MS . These are the people who live with the disease every single day of their lives . It was crucial that they were considered in the decisionmaking process . We wanted to shine light on the issues they say are most important to them , " Nelson said . The survey , conducted by International Communications Research and Harris Interactive Service Bureau , asked dozens of questions , including : " How would you describe your overall opinion of Tysabri ? " and " Do you think that Tysabri should be made available again ? " Opinions about the drug ranged from very positive to very negative . Half of the respondents had no definite opinion as to whether the drug should be returned to the market and wanted more information before making a decision .

Photograph Marcy Canavan : " Quality of life is more important to me than quantity of years lived . " // Estimating-and minimizing-risk No one knows the true risk of developing PML . A report on the cases of PML within the Tysabri trials was published in the March 2 , 2006 , issue of The New England Journal of Medicine . The researchers estimated that the incidence of PML in people who received Tysabri in the three clinical trials , taking an average of 17.9 monthly doses , is 1 case per 1000 patients . Biogen Idee and Elan Pharmaceuticals , Inc. , have proposed a risk management action plan , careful tracking of any adverse events , and a 5,000-person observational study to help evaluate long-term safety . The FDA may require a " black box " warning on Tysabri 's packaging as a condition for approval . A black box label is the strongest warning the FDA can impose on a pharmaceutical . Black boxes can be found on many other drugs , including the anti-depressant Prozac , Celebrex for arthritis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a therapy with a black box warning is a personal issue , and the individual 's risk-to-benefit ratio must be carefully considered in consultation with a qualified medical professional . Sidebar The Tysabri story In November 2004 , the FDA granted accelerated approval of Tysabri ( natalizumab ) for treatment of relapsing forms of MS , creating a new treatment option . The approval was based on 1-year data from two 2-year trials . In the first trial , AFFIRM , Tysabri reduced the frequency of relapses by 68% relative to placebo ; in the second trial , SENTINEL , a combination of Tysabri and Avonex ( interferon beta-1a ) reduced relapse rates by 54% relative to Avonex alone . But two people receiving the drug in the SENTINEL trial developed progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy or PML . One of them died and the other remains significantly disabled . A third case of PML was later confirmed in a person who had been taking the drug in a trial for Crohn 's disease . That person also died . Tysabri was immediately taken off the market . Since then , Tysabri 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safety reviews of the vast majority of the 3,000 people involved in Tysabri trials for MS , Crohn 's disease , and rheumatoid arthritis . In September 2005 , they submitted the results , requesting that the FDA conduct a " priority review " of their new data . Last November , the FDA agreed . On March 8 , 2006 , the FDA 's Advisory Committee unanimously recommended that Tysabri be returned to market for relapsing forms of MS . The committee also voted 7 to 5 to recommend Tysabri as a " first-line " therapy . In other words , Tysabri should be available to people who have not tried any of the other disease-modifying drugs ( Avonex , Rebif , Betaseron , or Copaxone ) . The committee recommended against limiting access to Tysabri based on disability level . While the FDA is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory committee , it usually does . The FDA was expected to make a decision about Tysabri by the end of March , after this issue went to press . For the latest news , consult our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1-800-FIGHT-MS . Sidebar How Tysabri works Tysabri ( natalizumab ) is a monoclonal antibody that blocks " adhesion molecules " on the surface of immune cells . Research suggests that the drug prevents immune cells from sticking to capillary walls and then migrating from the bloodstream into the brain and spinal cord . There , these cells can cause inflammation and start the process that damages nerve fibers and the myelin that insulates them . Tysabri is delivered by I.V . infusion in a health-care facility once a month . Author Affiliation Gary Sullivan is the managing editor of this magazine . // <p>
