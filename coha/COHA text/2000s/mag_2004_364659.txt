Looking at dozens of photographs for our D-day special this week , I was struck by how vividly the images caught the chaos of that famous day , a day that claimed the lives of thousands of Allied soldiers . And then I noticed something else : there are very few images that show the casualties . As it turns out , the goriest images were censored , and many pictures of American soldiers killed in combat were not allowed to be shown until later . <P> How times have changed . Since Gulf War II began , I 've looked at thousands of pictures from the battlefront . We 've published dozens of them across two-page spreads , including the now famous hospital photograph of Ali , an Iraqi boy who lost both arms in a U.S. bombing . We 've never tried to prettify war . Sometimes , however , I saw remarkable images that I felt were too graphic to print in TIME . Case in point : a series of photos taken last spring of U.S. soldiers carefully picking up limbs of dead Iraqis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the first time , of course , that TIME editors have weighed the challenge of showing the consequences of war while keeping the sensibilities of our readers in mind . We faced that issue in 1983 , when we covered the invasion of Grenada and the suicide bombing of the Marine barracks in Lebanon , and in 1993 , when Somali rebels ambushed U.S. troops and dragged the body of an American soldier through the streets of Mogadishu . In each case , we ran photographs that upset some readers but refrained from publishing the most brutal ones . We felt that what we presented to our readers did justice to the tragedies , but not in a gratuitous way . <P> It is not just a matter of when to show the body of a dead American soldier ; we 've wrestled with what is appropriate to show when covering the carnage in Rwanda in the mid-1990s , when hundreds of thousands of Tutsi were massacred by the Hutu , and during the recent uprising in Haiti , when I viewed photographs of bodies piled up in morgues that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( In that particular case , photographs of the chaos on Port-au-Prince 's streets were so vivid that I chose to use them to illustrate the story . ) <P> Yet it is also undeniable that the task of deciding what photos to run in TIME has grown much more difficult in the wake of 9/11 . In putting together our special issue on the World Trade Center attacks , I considered whether we should use photographs of the many victims who jumped out of windows rather than stay behind and be burned to death . I ultimately decided to go with a single photograph taken from a far distance of several people falling through the air ; other publications ran close-ups of a man making the same fatal leap . I 'm not saying that one decision is right and the other wrong but only that my sensibility led me to pick one over the other .
