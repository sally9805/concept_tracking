What Imployment Is He Fit For ? // Medieval , in some disrepair , the Woolsthorpe farmhouse nestled into a hill near the River Witham . With its short front door and shuttered windows , its working kitchen , and its bare floors of ash and linden laid on reeds , it had belonged to Newton 's forebears for just twenty years . In back stood apple trees . Sheep grazed for acres around . // Isaac was born in a small room at the top of the stairs . By the terms of feudal law this house was a manor and the fatherless boy was its lord , with seigniorial authority over a handful of tenant farmers in nearby cottages . He could not trace his ancestry back past his grandfather , Robert , who lay buried in the churchyard nearly a mile to the east . Still , the boy expected to live managing the farm in the place of the father he had never known . His mother , Hannah Ayscough , had come from gentlefolk . Her brother , the Reverend William Ayscough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anglican clergy ; now he occupied a village rectory two miles away . When Isaac was three years old and his widowed mother near thirty , she accepted a marriage offer from another nearby rector , Barnabas Smith , a wealthy man twice her age . Smith wanted a wife , not a stepson ; under the negotiated terms of their marriage Hannah abandoned Isaac in the Woolsthorpe house , leaving him to his grandmother 's care . // War flared in the countryside all through his youth . The decade-long Great Rebellion began in the year of his birth : Parliamentarians fighting Royalists , Puritans recoiling from the idolatry they saw in the Church of England . Motley , mercenary armies skirmished throughout the Midlands . Pikemen and musketeers sometimes passed through the fields near Woolsthorpe . Bands of men plundered farms for supplies . England was at war with itself and also , increasingly , aware of itself-its nationhood , its specialness . Divided as it was , convulsed over ecclesiastical forms and beliefs , the nation carried out a true revolution . The triumphant Puritans rejected absolutism and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , soon after Isaac turned six , Charles Stuart , the king , was beheaded at the wall of his palace . // This rustic country covered a thousandth of the world 's landmass , cut off from the main continent since the warming of the planet and the melting of polar ice 13,000 years before . Plundering , waterborne tribes had settled on its coasts in waves and diffused into its downs and valleys , where they aggregated in villages . What they knew or believed about nature depended in part on the uses of technology . They had learned to employ the power of water and wind to crush , grind , and polish . The furnace , the forge , and the mill had taken their place in an economy that thereby grew more specialized and hierarchical . People in England , as in many human communities , made metal-kettles of copper and brass , rods and nails of iron . They made glass . These crafts and materials were prerequisites now to a great leap in knowledge . Other prerequisites were lenses , paper and ink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fractions , and postal services spanning hundreds of miles . // By the time of Newton 's birth , one great city had formed , with about 400,000 people ; no other town was even a tenth as large . England was still a country of villages and farms , its seasons ordered by the Christian calendar and the rhythms of agriculture : lambing and calving , haymaking and harvest . Years of harvest failure had brought widespread starvation . Roving laborers and vagrants made up much of the population . But a class of artisans and merchants was coming into its own : traders , shopkeepers , apothecaries , glaziers , carpenters , and surveyors , all developing a practical , mechanical view of knowledge . They used numbers and made tools . The nucleus of a manufacturing economy was taking shape . // When Isaac was old enough , he walked to the village dame school , where he learned to read and studied the Bible and chanted arithmetic tables . He was small for his age , lonely and abandoned . Sometimes he wished his stepfather dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened to burn their house down over them . Sometimes he wished himself dead and knew the wish for a sin . On bright days sunlight crept along the wall . Darkness as well as light seemed to fall from the window- or was it from the eye ? No one knew . The sun projected slant edges , a dynamic echo of the window frame in light and shadow , sometimes sharp and sometimes blurred , expressing a three-dimensional geometry of intersecting planes . The particulars were hard to visualize , though the sun was the most regular of heavenly objects , the one whose cycles already defined the measures of time . Isaac scratched crude geometric figures , circles with arcs inscribed , and hammered wooden pegs into the walls and the ground to measure time exactly , to the nearest quarter-hour . He cut sun-dials into stone and charted the shadows cast by their gnomons . This meant seeing time as akin to space , duration as length , the length of an arc . He measured small distances with strings and made a translation between inches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation methodically as the seasons changed . Across the day the sun rose and fell ; across the year its position in the sky shifted slightly against the fixed stars and traced a slowly twisting figure eight , a figure invisible except to the mind 's eye . Isaac grew conscious of this pattern long before he understood it as the product of two oddities , the earth 's elliptical orbit and a tilt in its axis . // At Woolsthorpe anyone who cared to know the hour consulted Isaac 's dials . " O God ! Methinks it were a happy life , " said Shakespeare 's Henry VI , " to carve out dials quaintly , point by point , thereby to see the minutes how they run . " **29;788;TOOLONG told most people the time , though at some churches the hour could be read from mechanical clocks . At night the stars turned in the blue vault of the sky ; the moon waxed and waned and traced its own path , much like the sun 's , yet not exactly-these great globes , ruling the seasons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by invisible cords . Sun-dials embodied practical knowledge that had been refined over millennia . With cruder sun-dials , the hours were unequal and varied with the seasons . Better versions achieved precision and encouraged an altered sense of time itself : not just as a recurring cycle , or a mystical quality influencing events , but as duration , measurable , a dimension . Still , no one could perfect or even understand sun-dials until all the shifting pieces of a puzzle had been assembled : the shadows , the rhythms , the orbits of planets , the special geometry of the ellipse , the attraction of matter by matter . It was all one problem . // When Isaac was ten , in 1653 , Barnabas Smith died , and Hannah returned to Woolsthorpe , bringing three new children with her . She sent Isaac off to school , eight miles up the Great North Road , to Grantham , a market town of a few hundred families-now a garrison town , too . Grantham had two inns , a church , a guild hall , an apothecary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles was too far to walk each day ; Isaac boarded with the apothecary , William Clarke , on High Street . The boy slept in the garret and left signs of his presence , carving his name into the boards and drawing in charcoal on the walls : birds and beasts , men and ships , and pure abstract circles and triangles . // At the Kings School , one room , with strict Puritan discipline , Henry Stokes , schoolmaster , taught eighty boys Latin , theology , and some Greek and Hebrew . In most English schools that would have been all , but Stokes added some practical arithmetic for his prospective farmers : mostly about measurement of areas and shapes , algorithms for surveying , marking fields by the chain , calculating acres ( though the acre still varied from one county to the next , or according to the land 's richness ) . He offered a bit more than a farmer would need : how to inscribe regular polygons in a circle and compute the length of each side , as Archimedes had done to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall . He entered the lowest form at the age of twelve , lonely , anxious , and competitive . He fought with other boys in the churchyard ; sometimes noses were bloodied . He filled a Latin exercise book with unselfconscious phrases , some copied , others invented , a grim stream of thought : A little fellow ; My poore help ; Hee is paile ; There is no room for me to sit ; In the top of the house-In the bottom of hell ; What imployment is he fit for ? What is hee good for ? He despaired . I will make an end . I can not but weepe . I know not what to doe . // Barely sixty lifetimes had passed since people began to record knowledge as symbols on stone or parchment . England 's first paper mill opened at the end of the sixteenth century , on the Deptford River . Paper was prized , and the written word played a small part in daily life . Most of what people thought remained unrecorded ; most of what they recorded was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of information surfeit . " I hear new news every day , " wrote the vicar Robert Burton , attuned as he was-virtually living in the Bodleian Library at Oxford-to the transmission and storage of data : // those ordinary rumours of war , plagues , fires , inundations , thefts , murders , massacres , meteors , comets , spectrums , prodigies , apparitions , . . . and such like , which these tempestuous times afford . . . . New books every day , pamphlets , currantoes , stories , whole catalogues of volumes of all sorts , new paradoxes , opinions , schisms , heresies , controversies in philosophy , religion &amp;c. " // Burton was attempting to assemble all previous knowledge into a single rambling , discursive , encyclopedic book of his own . He made no apology for his resolute plagiarism ; or , rather , he apologized this way : " A dwarf standing on the shoulders of a Giant may see farther than a Giant himself . " He tried to make sense of rare volumes from abroad , which proposed fantastic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kepler , and Copernicus . He tried to reconcile them with ancient wisdom . // Did the earth move ? Copernicus had revived that notion , " not as a truth , but a supposition . " Several others agreed . " For if the Earth be the Center of the World , stand still , as most received opinion is , " and the celestial spheres revolve around it , then the heavens must move with implausible speed . This followed from measurements of the distance of sun and stars . Burton borrowed ( and mangled ) some arithmetic . " A man could not ride so much ground , going 40 miles a day , in 2,904 years , as the Firmament goes in 24 hours ; or so much in 203 years , as the said Firmament in one minute ; which seems incredible . " People were looking at the stars through spyglasses ; Burton himself had seen Jupiter through a glass eight feet long and agreed with Galileo that this wanderer had its own moons . // He was forced to consider issues of shifting viewpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conundrums : " If a man 's eye were in the Firmament , he should not at all discern that great annual motion of the earth , but it would still appear an indivisible point . " If a man 's eye could be so far away , why not a man ? Imaginations ran free . " If the earth move , it is a Planet , &amp; shines to them in the Moon , &amp; to the other Planetary Inhabitants , as the Moon and they to us upon the earth . " // We may likewise insert . . . there be infinite Worlds , and infinite earths or systems , in infinite ? ther , . . . and so , by consequence , there are infinite habitable worlds : what hinders ? . . . It is a difficult knot to untie . // Especially difficult because so many different authorities threw forth so many hypotheses : our modern divines , those heathen philosophers , heretics , schismatics , the Church of Rome . " Our latter Mathematicians have rolled all the stones that may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the World , out of their own Daedalean heads . " Many races of men have studied the face of the sky throughout history , Burton said , and now the day was coming when God would reveal its hidden mysteries . Tempestuous times , indeed . // But new books every day did not find their way to rural Lincolnshire . Newton 's stepfather , Smith , had owned books , on Christian subjects . The apothecary Clarke also owned books . Smith even possessed blank paper , in a large commonplace book that he had kept for forty years . He painstakingly numbered the pages , inscribed theological headings atop the first few , and otherwise left it almost entirely empty . Some time after his death this trove of paper came into Isaac 's possession . Before that in Grantham with two and a half pence his mother had given him , Isaac was able to buy a tiny notebook , sewn sheets bound in vellum . He asserted his ownership with an inscription : Isacus Newton hunc librum possidet . Over many months he filled the pages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than one-sixteenth of an inch high . He began at both ends and worked toward the middle . Mainly he copied a book of secrets and magic printed in London several years earlier : John Bate 's Mysteryes of Nature and Art , a scrap book , rambling and yet encyclopedic in its intent . // He copied instructions on drawing . " Let the thing which you intend to draw stand before you , so the light be not hindered from falling upon it . " " If you express the sunn make it riseing or setting behind some hill ; but never express the moon or starrs but up on necessity . " He copied recipes for making colors and inks and salves and powders and waters . " A sea colour . Take privet berries when the sun entreth into Libra , about the 13th of September , dry them in the sunn ; then bruise them &amp; steep them . " Colors fascinated him . He catalogued several dozen , finely and pragmatically distinguished : purple , crimson , green , another green , a light green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked pictures , " " colours for dead corpes , " charcoal black and seacoal black . He copied techniques for melting metal ( in a shell ) , catching birds ( " set black wine for them to drink where they come " ) , engraving on a flint , making pearls of chalk . //
