I suppose , for literary effect , I should start with how everything was dying that year  --  how the riverbed dried up into a brown Brillo pad , the wisteria shriveled on their vines . But the truth is , that brilliant April , after rain had soaked us all March , it felt to me as if the earth and the plants , the insects and trees just could n't stay in their pants . Daffodils unfurled and grinned into bloom ; tulips reached up their orange and crimson cupped hands . Across the street , the Japanese weeping cherry tree exploded into a firework of lilliputian pink clouds , while down the block Mrs. Zuppo 's lily garden peeked out from its bed weeks early . All the world was a stage , and I walked around in a daze beholding the spectacle that was life . It seemed to me it had never been this way . But then , I was waking up again , after all that time . During the more than two years since Oliver 's death , my goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After dropping Hazel at preschool or kindergarten or first grade and dragging myself through the errands ( grocery shopping , bill paying , dry cleaners for Paul ... all those things that plague the work-at-home wife ) , I 'd simply returned to my house and crawled back into bed , where , between the emptyescape of deep naps , I did my editing work  --  its own kind of refuge  --  until it was time to pick up Hazel again . Then , with what felt like superhuman effort , I would act out the role of the cheerful , inspired mother I was not , somehow getting us through the hours until we were at last back in bed again  --  her bed , this time , where we 'd both fall asleep , me half-waking only to switch to my own bed and continue my dreamless coma . I never felt Paul slip into bed hours later when he finally got home . Really , it was as if I were dead , except when taking care of Hazel or working , and then I operated on automatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year , with the first signs of spring in my New Jersey town  --  a slowly gentrifying commuter and college hub where octogenarian Dominicks and Guiseppes bordered thirtysomething Manhattan transplants like me , with handfuls of crunchy Gen X-ers tossed throughout  --  something had started to change . I felt my old self , the one I 'd thought was gone forever , sending out tiny shoots from deep in my bones  --  stiff , strong , green tips to tell me the roots were still in there , I was still in there , somehow ... and wanting , at last , out again . On the day this story begins , I had taken a morning walk , peeling my old Eileen Fisher cardigan from my arms to let the sun drench my pasty , winter-sapped skin . I 'd headed to the fish market for two slabs of salmon , then to the bakery for a crusty ciabatta . Then a bottle of sauvignon blanc from the liquor store and a bar of fine dark chocolate for dessert . I suppose I was celebrating my rebirth . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and by the time my piece of fish was done broiling I 'd already sampled a few bites , standing at the oven forking the salty pink flesh into my greedy mouth , burning its tender skin . I did n't care . It was worth it to taste that delectable bliss , and to finally crave food again . On the way to the table , I dragged my hunk of bread through the circle of salted olive oil I 'd drizzled onto my plate , bit it hard , and swallowed it practically whole . Unlike Paul , who 'd always been someone who eats to live , I had been  --  and now , it seemed , was on my way back to being  --  a happy fat person inside a genetically thin body : always anticipating my next meal , savoring it when it came . Today , I 'd fixed Paul the other piece of salmon  --  lemon , olive oil , splash of tamari  --  and left it front and center in the fridge , just so he 'd know , when he got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm had called in from some trendy restaurant nearby in the financial district , that I had thought of him , that I loved him . Elayna , the loving wife . I 'd also left him a salad and a couple of wedges of a perfect blood orange . Placing my dish on the table , I uncorked the wine , poured a glass , and sat down . I ate in rapture , licking the plate at the end . Well , why not ? I was alone , after all . My work lay open next to me , a manuscript of the latest soon-to-be issue of Popular Poetry magazine . Each month , the journal reproduced classic and some contemporary poems in a palatable and accessible form for those who wanted to see what they 'd missed in college or who wanted a tiny , digestible version of the contemporary poetry scene . My job , bestowed on me by an old English-major colleague at Barnard , was , frankly , a dream : I proofread and lightly edited the copy , not so much for mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ) but for content and appeal . In essence , I was simply an early reader who each month sent back a detailed critique . I made minimal suggestions  --  " Flip-flop the two Hopkins poems , " or " More of an intro on the Dickinson might be nice "  --  and sometimes I suggested stories . ( " How about a feature on Edward Lear ? " ) The pay was laughable , of course  --  the job amounted to half-time work for an hourly salary barely above minimum wage  --  but Paul 's hefty lawyer paychecks made that okay , and since he worked heftily to make those paychecks , it had been more important , once we 'd had Hazel , for me to do something close to home than to pull in a decent salary . When Hazel was young , the job had provided me the perfect escape from the obsessive mothering and brutal self-examination full-time parenting can bring . Once Oliver died , the work kept me from descending into darkness when Hazel was n't around . In fact , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could look forward to anything then . But today , after my feast ( for dessert , I melted squares of the chocolate bar in the microwave and poured them over a fat ball of coffee ice cream ) , I was distracted , unable to focus . I glanced out between the little white curtains in my kitchen and saw a smattering of dark clouds moving in . Trees blowing , swaying . Immediately , I grew anxious . Hazel was phobic about storms , and I could n't bear to think of her panicked out there . I glanced at the clock above the stove . Still almost two hours until I had to get her from Pansy 's house , where she went on Wednesdays  --  half days at her school  --  from noon until three ( more days in the summer or if I got busy ) . I got up , wandered into the living room , and glanced out the windows . This was the ugly side of our house , and the neighborhood canine Porta Potti  --  a small strip of dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big old hemlock tree . Anything that did manage to grow there the neighborhood dogs quickly dispensed with . I could n't do much about their pissing , obviously , but the rest of what they did was illegal and infuriating when left there . Yesterday and today there had been fresh loads of poop to greet me , and looking out now , I spotted a third and felt the rage rise up through my blood , almost thrillingly . If I found out who was doing it , I 'd tear the hair from his head . I wandered to the back door and then outside , onto the deck , and I leaned over the edge of the rail , letting the balmy breeze breathe over me . It was unseasonably warm ; the air felt pregnant with pollen and humidity . I closed my eyes and shook my hair down over my bare arms , then inhaled deeply , sucking in the splendor through every pore . The cicadas shrieked ; the atmosphere seemed to vibrate . I could feel the charge seeping through my skin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could have wept with joy . Someone went by , walking a dog : I heard a collar jingle , loud panting , canine toenails on tar , and then I saw them , a silver Weimaraner with an orange sneaker in its mouth , leading a cute , crew-cut boy by the leash . Guy , not boy , I should say , though he was a boy compared to me . He was wearing jeans and no shirt , exposing his lightly freckled white chest . His arms were curved and ample for his otherwise lean frame . Maybe gay , I reasoned , but either way , a Gen X-er for sure , or was it Gen Y-er , these days ? I watched boy and dog pass by , cross the street , and head into the driveway of the small apartment building Paul and I jokingly called the Tenement . With its Victorian charm and two sugar maples out front , it was as unlike the tenement where we 'd lived in New York  --  broken buzzers , roaches , filthy stairwell  --  as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Manhattan . Anyway , they mounted the steps , boy and dog , and climbed to the top floor , the fourth , dog still carrying the sneaker . In they went . I was surprised . I had n't seen them before , and , ashamed as I am to admit it , I knew virtually everything about the area from my house to Hazel 's school ( and little , these days , about much of anything beyond )  --  and certainly who 'd moved into and out of the Tenement . The place was filled with young people like him , not-quite-kids with tattoos and pierced noses , tongues , lips , ear cartilage , and ( yes ) chins , hair of blue and green and nickel gray and magenta that stuck up with faux messiness . They were soon-to-be graduate students at the nearby university , or philosophically inclined slackers , artists , aspiring " filmmakers , " living off their parents till they figured out a bearable way to make a living or invented some iPod facsimile and set themselves up for life . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in the world with obsessions other than their commute or what preschool was best . These were people waiting for their lives to begin , people who , for all their manifestations of depression and grunge and loneliness , were secretly full of optimism and promise and the blazing , glorious arrogance of youth . Their mistakes did n't count , because their Real Lives had n't yet begun . Things could change for them in an instant . I glanced up at the apartment boy and dog had gone into , but other than a couple of potted plants on the fire escape , there was no sign of life . Beyond the Tenement , houses speckled the hills ; if you climbed a hill at night , you could see shimmering New York City , a million seductive points of light . I heard the commuter train wail , the cars , on the main drag a few blocks away , streaming toward somewhere  --  maybe only the new mega Home Depot near the highway . I went down into the yard , set up Hazel 's T-ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls , high and hard . I gathered the balls and did it again , and then again . Then I turned and stomped back inside , panting as hard as that Weimaraner . I glanced impatiently around my kitchen , then took off my sandals and kicked them across the room . The floor  --  Italian tiles Paul had picked out on a business trip to Sicily  --  was cool and smooth on my feet . I peeled off my T-shirt and tossed that too , until I was down to the gray sports bra I 'd chosen this morning , thinking maybe later I 'd go for a run . My breasts were large and full and not too badly sagging yet , despite having nursed Hazel for a year . They were still my best feature , and I 'd always made a point of standing straight , shoulders back , so I did n't turn into one of those slender , large-chested women being dragged floorward by her rack . The rest of my body was thinner than usual  --  no exercise and little appetite for two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , finally , to bloom back into its curvier shape , and I was glad . In the living room , a Louis Armstrong CD was poised to play , but I was n't in the mood . I tossed in Alanis Morissette 's Jagged Little Pill and turned up the volume . Her twangy , pissed-off rock blared out . I listened a minute , feeling it loosen me and make me happy . And then I did something I had n't done since before I 'd had Oliver . I danced . I danced , and  --  I kid you not  --  I sang too , because the words seemed to be speaking to me : words about being tired but happy , sick but pretty , messed up but moving on . I twirled around , letting this sweet young thing 's tough voice and angry words take me back to thirty , twenty-eight , twenty-three . When the song ended , I played it again . I was hot . Melting , really . I peeled off my skirt and hurled it , leaving my gray cotton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my underwear , a demented overgrown ballerina ; if Hazel had been there , she would have rolled her eyes . Out the window , someone rode by on a bike . The song ended . I played it three more times , then flopped on the couch , spent . By the time I thought to look at the clock , I had all of fifteen minutes until I had to pick up Hazel at Pansy 's . I bolted upstairs to shower , then rushed down and grabbed my purse  --  big , leather , gift from Paul for my recent thirty-fifth birthday  --  and , digging for the car keys , started toward the door . But I happened to glance out before I opened it , and what I saw made me stop and stare . Gen XY Boy and his dog were back , and Dog  --  back arched into a sleek silver mountain , tail extended out behind him  --  was depositing a pile of fresh turds onto my Porta Potti strip . I watched until the canine had reclosed his butt hole and retained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scoop up the dung ? XY Boy glanced at the turds , and then  --  as I 'd somehow expected  --  turned and headed briskly back home . I was out my front door in two seconds . " Excuse me ! " I yelled , rushing down the steps . XY Boy stopped and turned around ; XY Dog turned too , wagging his tail . " Oh , hey , " Boy called , stepping toward me again . Neither one of them had an iota of guilt on his ( or her ) beautiful face , which pissed me off even more  --  though my anger , I confess , was a bit subsumed by the excitement I felt at having come upon the criminal in action . " I was just  --  " Boy started , but I cut him off . " Can I tell you something ? " I stalked toward him , hands on my hips . " I have a six-year-old daughter who plays on this lawn . If there 's a pile of dog shit on it , she steps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have you ever tried cleaning dog shit out of the rug in your bathroom ? " I stared at him , furious . He opened his mouth , presumably to answer , but I cut him off again . He was young , beautiful , irresponsible ; he was my scapegoat for all the carefree people whose dogs had crapped on my lawn for the past five years . " Do I use your yard as my toilet ? " I demanded . He smiled a little , then shook his head . " No . Not that I know of , anyway . " I saw the gleam in his eye . " Oh , go to hell , " I said , because I knew I was a pathetic cliche , the aging lawyer 's wife getting angry at the cute-but-careless young renter who sullied her perfect property . I turned around and marched back up to my house , anxious to get inside now . But XY Boy called , " Wait ! " I stopped and turned again . " I guess you 'd never believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog . " I snorted . " Except this one particular time when I happened to see you ? You 're right . I do n't think I would . " " Well , " he said , " this one particular time just happens to be the time I gave away my plastic bag to someone just down the block "  --  he gestured with his head back in the direction from which he 'd come  --  " because she happened to be in her own particular dog-do bind . I figured Sasha here would probably make it home without a problem , and if she did n't , I 'd just go home and get another bag and come back and clean it up . " " And that 's where you were going now ? " I felt myself soften just a touch ; at least he cared enough to try . He shrugged . " But I guess I do n't blame you for not believing that . It 's like the kid caught leaving the candy store with a pocketful of baseball cards swearing he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I raised my eyebrows . Maybe he was n't as dumb as he was beautiful . " Forget it , " he said , before I could respond . " Sorry about the mess . I 'll be right back to clean it up . " I shrugged now myself , as if it were really no big deal and never had been . " Whatever , " I said , stealing a phrase from Hazel 's repertoire , which made me realize , with renewed panic , that I was already late to get her . I came back down the steps and started to walk quickly toward the garage , away from him . " By the way , " he called , " I like Alanis Morissette too . I have a great bootleg concert cd , if you ever want to borrow it . I live right across the street . Fourth floor . " I was still walking , but slowly now , and for a step or two I actually wondered how he knew I liked Alanis Morissette . And then I stopped . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face . Had he seen me dancing in my living room ? Had he been just passing by , or actually stood there looking in my window ? I thought about how I 'd tossed off my shirt , peeled off my skirt , hurled my body around . Oh my god . I wanted to reach out and smack him . He may have blushed then too , realizing what his offer had revealed , but I could be mistaken . At any rate , after a second , he jumped from a standstill to a trot , like a well-trained horse . " Be right back , " he called , and off he went , his dog trotting after him . Son of a bitch , I thought . I turned and hightailed it toward my car to get Hazel . And that was the beginning . Continues ...
