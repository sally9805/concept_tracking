Story and photos by Paul Steffy * Eureka , Montana Photograph A million-dollar view greets Paul and Sherri every morning . The circular portion of their home was a kit . Photograph The kit home is essentially circular , built from 20 , 8x8-foot panels that attach at an 18  --  degree angle . The crew took a month to put the structure up . // Almost everyone under the age of 50 daydreams of an early retirement . My wife and I certainly did . Beginning . seven years ago we did something about it . Our initial plan was for me to retire at 55 . We 'd buy a large pickup truck and a fifth-wheel trailer and would travel the United States indefinitely-a retirement many couples enjoy immensely . After doing our homework and considering the options available in this lifestyle , we changed our minds . The value of a truck or trailer drops immediately after you buy it , and even though you 're using the vehicle or trailer , it 's an expensive proposition . At this point we changed the plan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the maddening crowds of Southern California . Our next step was to decide where to live . My wife Sherri and I have traveled extensively and know what type of terrain and geography please us . I ordered literature on eight states from a national real-estate chain . After eliminating several options , we decided on Montana , land of Charley Russell and Fred Remington , of mountains and pine trees , abundant wildlife and scant people , rich in history and really cold winters . At that time , neither of us had actually visited Montana . So checkbook in hand , we flew to Missoula , rented a car and began our trek to find a spot to spend the rest of our lives . The idea of long winter months spent cloistered indoors does n't appeal to everyone . That 's fine with us . We eventually settled on Eureka , a town that seems to still be cruising in the 1950s . With a population of 1,500 , Eureka lies eight miles from the Canadian border . Its small-town atmosphere , clean air , semi-arid climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year  --  round were just what we wanted . After locating land , the real work began . We purchased 14 acres on a hilltop facing north . The hill is 200 feet above the surrounding countryside and offers our " million-dollar , 360-degree view . " In June 2001 , we each left well paying jobs with good benefits in the San Diego area . ( I retired after 20 years . ) I had worked weekends , holidays and odd hours for a mass transit system . Commuting was easy for me , but Sherri 's driving time had reached 40 minutes to drive a scant eight miles . It was time to go . We sold our home , cashed in every available resource and went forward . Anyone looking for land in almost any state can find " bargain " prices in the $500 to $1,000 per acre range . But beware : Some power companies charge $15,000 to $20,000 per mile to provide power . Telephone lines and roads are expensive , as well . Do n't be fooled into buying cheap land only to discover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or septic system and provide other necessities before you can build your dream home . Even if you choose to avoid the power company and have a cell phone , purchasing the off-grid equipment can cost thousands of dollars , and cell phones do n't always work in remote areas . ( They do , luckily , in nearly all areas around our home . ) Our land came with a road , well , phone line and electricity hook-up . So although we paid more initially to have utilities and the gravel road to our house , the upfront expense was worth it to us . Some advice to those wishing to follow our example is to know all your construction expenses in advance . Ask your contractor for all estimates up front . Get time estimates for completion of each stage of construction Most subcontractors arrive on time and do their job in a reasonable amount of time . But not all do . We hired a roofer who , after 2-1/2 weeks , finally showed up one afternoon-without a ladder . We finally fired him but by then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the previous , so when one is delayed , others ca n't begin . I can not stress enough : Know your expenses and follow a timeline . After looking at various costs , such as hiring an architect , we decided to buy a kit for the major part of our home . The house is two stories with 4,000 square feet on both levels . The design is essentially circular , which allows for more efficient heating and cooling , as well as making the most of our 360-degree view . Photograph The deck has 1,040 square feet and is made of redwood , which Paul and Sherri are going to leave untreated , in keeping with their desire never to paint eaves or railings again . // The house kit went together well , and we were happy , for the most part , with the support we got from the company . The manufacturer says a half dozen workers who know how to construct it can have the kit up and waterproof within a week . The guys I hired had n't built a structure like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The design has 20 , 8x8-foot exterior panels . Each attaches at an angle of 18 degrees , a logistical challenge . When we were finished , it was only off by about three-quarters of an inch-unbelievable . Our contractor called the company several times to get more information , which brings me to the next bit of advice : If you use a kit , make sure the business has a toll free number and someone knowledgeable to advise you over the phone . The company we used also furnished a roof jack for the duration of the project , and this was a big help . Having the kit delivered was another lesson in the necessity of getting the facts up front . We did n't learn until almost the shipping date that the kit required not one but two semitrailer loads , which doubled our shipping costs . We paid for two truckloads , only to find out the company had switched and shipped by rail , which did n't cost as much . However , because our contract did n't cover such a change , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what your transport needs will be and get in writing that you 'll be refunded any difference in actual shipping costs . ( The 50 cents per mile savings add up quickly , and the money wo n't be in your pocket . ) Do n't just send the shipping charges , or you might give away hundreds of dollars . Accomplishing this job in rural Montana was significantly different from doing a similar job in an urban area . Skilled labor is limited here . In the city , if someone does n't show up , you open the phone directory and find another carpenter . Here , you have to be more patient . Whether or not you 're in a city , you need to get all estimates for work in writing . People here do n't like to do this , they want to do everything by verbal agreement . But we noticed that the ones with verbal agreements ended up wanting to charge us more , and the ones with written estimates stuck with the original price . So , get it in writing . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting , floor coverings , cabinets , light fixtures , interior doors , drapes and , finally , move-in . I did most of the interior finish work myself . We had to rent a two-bedroom house for an extra six weeks , an unplanned expense . So our plans to have horses , irrigation and an outbuilding have been set aside , at least temporarily , due to the need to control costs . We 've had our share of temporary inconvenience . For instance , we completed the garage in June 2000 to store the kit through the winter , then ended up using the garage as our TV and computer room for several months during construction . But this and other inconveniences were a small price to pay . All things considered , we 're glad we moved from an area with 3.5 million people to a small town in Montana . It 's a great place for those of us who appreciate seasonal changes-and wildlife in greater numbers than people .
