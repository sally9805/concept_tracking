A Son of the West // For most of his life Ulysses S. Grant thought of himself as a westerner . He was a child of the great Valley of Democracy , born on April 27 , 1822 , a hundred yards from the north bank of the Ohio . The country thereabouts was less than a generation removed from raw frontier , Ohio having achieved statehood only nineteen years earlier , and the village of Point Pleasant , some twenty-five miles southeast of Cincinnati , was but a tiny huddle of cabins and rude frame houses . Ohio was the easternmost of the states being carved from the old Northwest Territory , but to New England and New York , to the original states of the Atlantic seaboard , it seemed still a remote West : raw and bountiful , unfettered , rich in possibility . // Forty years later , in 1862 , it was as a western general that Grant achieved the sudden celebrity that seems peculiarly American , after his victory and successful demand for an unconditional surrender at Fort Donelson-a Union triumph that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , just two years after that , it was as the famous leader of the western armies that he was selected to command all Union forces . He was " brought east . " The small vignette of Grant 's arrival in the grand lobby of Willard 's Hotel in Washington , in March 1864 , is an enduring cameo of American popular history : the most famous man in the country , next to Abraham Lincoln himself , signing the register as " U.S. Grant and son , Galena , Ill. , " a traveler so small and dusty that the clerk did not recognize him ; an unpretentious guest who could not , it appeared , have cared less . No doubt , too , the instinctive rapport between Abraham Lincoln and his new lieutenant general owed much to their common heritage as westerners-as James Russell Lowell said of Lincoln , " out of the very earth , unancestried , unprivileged , unknown " - and was demonstrated most powerfully in their common understanding of the needs of the South in the days just before , and just after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ancestried " in a way that Lincoln was not . It was known that Matthew Grant had landed in Massachusetts Bay in 1630 . But Grant 's paternal forebears had been moving west for two centuries : from Plymouth , Massachusetts , to the Connecticut River valley , across New York State and Pennsylvania . Ulysses Grant 's grandfather , Captain Noah Grant , had fought in the Revolution , lost his first wife , remarried , and moved to western Pennsylvania . Here he and Rachel built a cabin on the Monongahela River , not far from modern Pittsburgh . They raised a large family . Noah , by trade a cobbler and by character an idler , would soon move the family again : first to Fawcettstown , Ohio , on the Ohio River , thence to Deerfield in the Western Reserve . // There is a homely story-such tales can not be authenticated-that Noah 's son Jesse , the father of Ulysses Grant , just shy of his sixth birthday , came upon his mother , who was alone and weeping . " George Washington is dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any relation of yours ? " the boy asked . This was in December 1799. // Rachel died only three years later , and , in the unhappy practice of the time , the family was eventually broken up , the younger children distributed among relatives , and the eldest , Jesse included , put out to make their way on their own . Jesse was eleven . // He made his way by mother wit and determination . In adolescence Jesse 's was already an avid , ambitious personality , close to the caricature of frontier Americans already familiar to English and European visitors and readers . A modern student of the Ohio of this time notes that Americans were " fidgety and nervous when not doing something that might be called work . " Jesse did odd jobs , was a roustabout for three years until , by serendipity , he was hired by Judge and Mrs. George Tod to work on their farm near Youngstown . It was the making of him . He lived with the Tods for five years , growing into a young man of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they read , they had nice things ; they challenged , worked , educated , and inspired him . Jesse developed an unassuageable determination to become rich , to be Somebody . He read voraciously ; he became a lifelong autodidact , a man of words and opinions of whom it might be said that " he never had an unuttered thought . " But the boy of six who wondered whether his mother was related to George Washington would survive to see his own son twice inaugurated as president : and , at one of those inaugurals , compared to Washington himself . // Jesse moved on . He learned and worked at the tanner 's trade under his half brother Peter , in Maysville , Kentucky ; later with an Ohio tanner , Owen Brown , and his son ( Jesse 's contemporary ) , the future abolitionist John Brown ; finally as the young partner of another Ohioan , in Ravenna , John Wells . Tanning to contemporary ears connotes little ; it is no more helpful to our sense of its contemporary importance and standing as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tanning was in fact an enormously lucrative trade in the first half of the nineteenth century . The demand for leather and worked leather goods was huge . This was a business in which , by the standards of rural Ohio , an ambitious , smart man could grow rich . The famous Galena address ( US . Grant , Galena , Ill. ) owes entirely to Jesse 's success as a tanner whose business eventually expanded from southern Ohio to northwestern Illinois . // Jesse Grant was now twenty-three . Four years later , in June 1821 , he married Hannah Simpson , the third of four children of another widower , John Simpson of Pennsylvania , who , like Captain Noah Grant , had remarried , moved west , lighting finally in Bethel , near Point Pleasant . Here he bought and worked a substantial farm , and here Jesse began his brief courtship of Hannah . // She is variously described as calm , imperturbable , taciturn , " cleanly , " quietly devout in her Methodism-a natural complement to her garrulous husband . It is fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ psychiatrists call affect , Ulysses became far more his mother 's than his father 's son . // Hannah and Jesse would have six children , three girls and three boys , but Ulysses-the first-remained the apple of his father 's eye for the first thirty years of his life , and , after a gap of several years , thereafter . He served partly as an engine of his father 's ambition . Christened Hiram Ulysses ( an uneasy burden at best , the " Ulysses " contracted to " Useless " during his boyhood ) , the son was raised in an atmosphere of easy discipline and devoted attention . Jesse always introduced or spoke of him as " my Ulysses . " He doted on him . He communicated both to his son and to the town of Georgetown , the county seat to which the family moved in 1823 , that he was , indeed , a child of singular gifts and destiny . The boy would succeed as Jesse was succeeding ; he would be , he had to be , noticed and admired . Historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character to the nature of Ulysses Grant 's boyhood , but their speculations often seem forced . What is known is that Jesse , a self-important bustler in a small town , bragged about Ulysses at every opportunity and was determined that he have every advantage . For her part , Hannah disbelieved in praise . She was undemonstrative in her affections ; she was not a mother to whom the son could repair for understanding and compassionate counsel . // Grant 's boyhood was conventional for its time , punctuated by those kinds of events and experiences that childhood friends remember much later on , when their subject has become famous . He was taught at the local subscription school ; in adolescence he was sent off for one-year terms at two nearby boarding schools , the latter to prepare him for possible attendance at West Point . He was an unremarkable student : diffident and inward , watchful , reluctant to speak up . The town saw him as bashful , inferring that , because he did not talk much , he was n't particularly bright . // He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ingenuity , such as contriving means of moving heavy rocks or logs needed for Jesse 's tanning business ( which the boy hated and which , no doubt , planted in him a lifetime 's revulsion for the sights and smells of slaughter and blood ) . He evinced an early practical handiness-skill for doing , usually alone , practical things that needed to be done , taking particular pleasure in persevering until they were completed . It is not too much to argue that that quality in Grant which Lincoln most admired , and for which he was most constantly appreciative , was already visible in the boy of ten or twelve : that of not asking for help or advice , not freighting problems with imagined difficulties , but just doing them . Forty years on , when General George B. McClellan was demanding and pleading for more soldiers , Grant was asking simply , when do I start ? " What I want is to advance . " // His own Memoirs provide testimony both ironic and genial . // One of my superstitions has always been when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to have to turn back until the thing intended was accomplished . I have frequently started to go places where I had never been to and to which I did not know the way , depending upon making inquiries on the road . And if I got past the place without knowing it , instead of turning back , I would go on until a road was found turning in the right direction , take that , and come in on the other side . // Grant evinced an early love for horses that was as powerful as his revulsion from the smells and sights of the tannery . There are several recorded memories of prodigies of horsemanship and of a rare and visible ability-what today might be called horse whispering-to communicate with them . By fourteen Ulysses had established a livery service , owned and operated alone , in which the young driver would deliver passengers all over Ohio . Earlier-an incident at the very epicenter of Grant lore , adduced as an example of the boy 's dullness and credulity-Ulysses had visited a Mr. Ralston to buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go as high as twenty-five dollars , but to try to get the animal for twenty . " Papa says I can go as high as twenty-five , " the boy said to the owner , who promptly sold him the horse for twenty-five dollars . Grant historiography has generally been unkind to the child , locating flaws which will bloom grossly in later , political , life . But the anecdote may also illustrate other qualities : bottom-line directness and fairness . Grant knew the horse 's worth . Nonetheless , the story achieved a wide contemporary currency , generally parsed by resentful neighbors as an example of stupidity . It is one of a small family of such tales ; together they limn a portrait of a shy youngster sometimes slow on the uptake , driven in each successive encounter more and more upon his own resources , slowly becoming reluctant to say anything , to disclose to any but his closest companions his feelings and thoughts . Perhaps , as Churchill noted of his own ancestor Marlborough , such slights and twinges of adversity in youth are needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motherwit without which great purposes are seldom accomplished . " // Several Brown County boys had already attended the United States Military Academy at West Point , and one of them , Bartlett Bailey , had attended and failed . A vacancy was thus created . Jesse applied on Ulysses 's behalf , seeking the nomination from Congressman Thomas L. Hamer , a former friend whom politics had estranged-Jesse was a Whig , Hamer a Jacksonian Democrat . Hamer now obliged Jesse , in a hurried final act of the spring 1839 congressional session , sending forward the name ( so he imagined it to be ) " Ulysses Simpson Grant . " // The son knew what was coming . Over the previous Christmas holiday Jesse had told him , " Ulysses , I believe you are going to receive your appointment . " // " What appointment ? " // " To West Point . I have applied for it . " // " But I wo n't go . " // In his Memoirs , Ulysses recalled , " He said he thought I would , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Had there been an A. N. Wyeth or a Norman Rockwell in 1839 , he would surely have been drawn to the scene : the youth , tiny , barely five feet tall , as apprehensive as eager , standing at the end of the dock on the shore of the gleaming broad river , entering upon an adventure that must have seemed cosmic in its dimension . No ardent patriotism or military vocation had brought Ulysses Grant to this pass . His was an opportunity unsought , an obligation laid upon him by a father with whom it would never have occurred to him to argue . The boy was game ; he was curious ; he seemed marked already by an easy fatalism that predisposed him to make the best of what he had been given , without complaint or undue worry . These qualities had already placed him at the observant edge of things : he was a watcher , slow in passing judgment , comfortable in going his own way , already full of the quiet self-reliance that made him act rather than explain himself . Neighbors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse whisperings , at the homely anecdotes retrofitted to make him look simple . It was widely expected that he would fail at West Point . // All his life , and in the 120 years since his death , friends , rivals and enemies , biographers , and historians have condescended to Ulysses Grant . At seventeen he already understood that he produced such an effect on smart people . Not for the last time , he struck out on his own . // Chapter Two A Military Education // Grant arrived at West Point on May 29 , 1839 . He was a young seventeen , tiny ( five feet one inch , 117 pounds ) and unprepossessing , too intimidated to complain that the academy authorities had perpetuated Congressman Hamer 's mistake . From now on , like Harry Truman , he would have an unearned S for a middle initial-signifying Simpson , of course , but effacing forever , in fact and in memory , Hiram . Ulysses Simpson Grant : the triumphant iambic trimeter of the new name would later become a thumping proclamation of determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever proclaim Grant 's commitment to Unconditional Surrender . For the moment , older cadets , including William Tecumseh Sherman , seeing " U.S. Grant-Ohio " on the matriculation roll , made the obvious links and jibes : U.S. Uncle Sam . " Sam " was how Grant would be known at West Point and in the army for the next fifteen years . // In 1962 Douglas MacArthur remembered his 1894 enrollment at West Point as the fulfillment of a childhood dream . For Grant it was quite the opposite . He had not wanted to attend ; he had hoped and waited , in vain , for news that the academy had been shut down . //
