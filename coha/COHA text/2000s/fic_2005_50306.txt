Just a few months ago , Michael Libling rang in the holidays with his dark fantasy " Christmas in the Catskills . " Now he gives us a vision of the near future-a future in which people spend lots of time gazing into their pasts . Are those who learn from the past condemned to regress it ! <p> IT WAS ONE OF THOSE nights . I 'm on shift maybe ten minutes when this twisted preppy , guts more pickled than a jar of dills , gets it going . She 's loud and proud and dense enough to think I 'm buying her crock , that she 'd ridden with Custer , been Clark Gable 's first wife , been wet nurse to Sylvia Plath , been Mary Todd Lincoln 's mother 's best friend ( cleverly not Mary Todd herself ) , served as the third Archbishop of Canterbury , been personal physician to Mao Ze-dong , and a bunch of other high-blown lifedocs that just do n't ring true . ( Except maybe that Sylvia Plath one , whoever she is . ) I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rats on her bull , but there is n't any point . She 's riding on an Oldies 107.9 FM freebie and the look in her eyes tells me all I need to know . Coming up empty leaves you emptier than you 've ever been before . I knew , of course ; I 'd been there . Next up , an old fart dumps his pension check on an all-dressed twentieth-century dive that stalls in vaudeville and , because the sound buffers are down again in Retropod Twelve , I get to hear **79;2453;TOOLONG maybe eighty or ninety times before he gets a break on Broadway and belts out the entire score of Annie Get Your Gun in a ruptured falsetto that reminds me of that time in school I caught a fastball in the nuts . Tells me to call him Ethel as he wheezes out into the dark . And just when I think the worst is over , some punk rips off half his own nose trying to claw the chip out during a REM 4 that dipped too fast into what he calls a Khmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out . Sherky draws the asshole 's attention to the sign behind the cash - WE ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR PAST LIVES - but the jerk thinks otherwise , and throws his hands round Sherky 's neck like he 's his laundry bag . Big mistake . I pull him off , give him a head-butt to the bridge , and send him into the street , where he bleeds vengeance , not on Hadley , not on Inochi Corp . - the clowns who made the chip - and not on Sherky , but on me , the night manager , a guy who 's doing his best to get by . ( There was nothing special about the punk . Run-ins with his sort were routine . I forgot about him soon as I was done with him . Only wish he would have forgotten me . Yeah , Wray Erling Dreng he was . Did n't even connect the name to the face until I had to . ) Five years on the night shift and I still hankered not just for the days , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report and the AMA and FDA bulletins and the WHO directive and all that other crap . When people would come in and blow their heads off or o.d. or hara-kiri on me . Yeah , it was busy and messy and I hated the cleaning up , but I made a small fortune in overtime ( thanks to all the mopping and scrubbing and disinfecting ) , and the job never beat me down . Not like nights . And the tips . Man , the tips were good , back then . The LWTs - **26;2534;TOOLONG - were something else , I tell you . No more than a few months out of school , my first Christmas on the job , some flake-azoid named Tackaberry promises me three hundred grand . No bull . Three hundred big ones . " It is what you would expect of a disciple of our Lord at this time of year , is it not , Nathan Stark ? " Never failed , the creepiest customers were the ones who felt compelled to speak your name tag , act all buddy-buddy with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me in his will . And real or not , there was no way I was going to blow it . " Yes , sir , Mr. Tackaberry , sir , " I say , " it surely is what I would expect of a disciple of our Lord at this time of year , sir . " I 'm so damn polite , you 'd think I had a teacup up my ass . Then he says , " And that is precisely the reason I am bequeathing you this tidy sum , my son . I was Bartholomew , you know ? " " Yes , sir , I know . " Everybody knew . Back then , at least . Once the history rats confirmed Tackaberry 's claims , the story kept the locals buzzing for a good week . Legit icons were few and far between in these parts . Especially those fluent in gibberish or Aramaic , as they called it . Yeah , the Biblers had a new hero , all right . Tackaberry got kissed on the toes so often , he went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the switch to Birkenstocks . Then he got some kind of foot disease from a Bibler with herpes or something , and his toenails turned this beefy purple - like he 'd been kicking through blueberries . He was back in Hush Puppies real quick , two sizes larger too , because of the scabs and swelling . Sure , I admit , the three hundred grand was on my mind whenever the guy showed , but I never figured on collecting . Not once . That was the first thing I told the cops . The cops back then , I mean . Tackaberry strolls in just after lunch , same as always , radiating benevolence like some customers throw off yesterday 's sauerkraut . But no sooner do I harness him in , the geek up and blows a hole through the part of his body where some big mass of inoperable crud had strung down roots . Trouble was , he also blew a hole through the thoracic plate on Retropod Nine - a spanking new DeepDrifter model yet . But here comes the clincher : Hadley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire inheritance to replace it . " Your shift , Stark , your responsibility , " he says . " Consider yourself fortunate I do n't dock you for the overage . " Come summer , the prick switches me to nights and transfers me out of the burbs to the core . The heart of freakin " Freakville , for freak sakes . Temporary , he says . Yeah . Right . And though I thought it to be the worst thing that ever happened , I now know it to have been the best . Because five years later Sam throws me her curve . And just like the Tackaberry deal , I do n't see it coming for a second . I take my break around nine-thirty , just before Sherky screws off at ten . Crowds tend to be thinning out by then and it 's not like I ca n't handle it alone , even if it stays busy . Sherky comes by his name honestly , if you know what I mean . Still , the guy thinks he 's management material . I take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pie , same as she 's done for the last four months . I love girls with guy names , but that 's not the only reason I got it bad for her . I mean , you 've seen her eyes . The photos , anyhow . And , well , the rest of her was n't too shabby either . Mostly , though , she 's just plain nice . The decent sort . Sweet . But not so sweet she 's not what every flaming heterosexual male would want . Yeah , sooner or later , you can be sure I would have taken her home to Mom . The pie is raspberry . Fresh raspberries too . None of that phony red goo . " You look tired , Nate , " Sam says , topping up my coffee , though I have n't touched it . " Been one of those nights . " I groan to stress my point . " Closest any customer has been to normal is nearly . " " No different than here then . " She smiles , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the booth behind me . " Oh , there 's a difference , " I tell her , " trust me . When people get cranky over a cheese sandwich , that 's one thing . But you have n't seen anything till you 've seen a soul searcher get cranky over a past life . " She eggs me on , so I unwind . Give her the highlights of the way it 's gone so far . The preppy . The old fart . The punk . She pats my hand . " Poor you . " God , if a woman 's touch were ever therapeutic , it was Sam 's . She tops up my coffee and , this time , I need it . Then , kind of hesitant , she says , " Your invitation , is it still good , Nate ? You were n't teasing , were you ? " " Oh , jeez ! " I catch on right away . " I forgot-your birthday .... " Dumb way to make headway in a relationship , I tell you . " Last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mention it , you looked so tired .... " " I always look tired . " " I know , but .... " " Twenty-one , right ? " " Uh-huh . And six days . " " You 're legal now , " I tell her . " Sure , the invitation stands . Come on over . All the regression you want , on the house . Gratis . " Really , it was that simple . No fireworks . No chorus of angels singing in harmony . No inkling whatsoever of what was coming down . Sam is jumping out of her skin ; there 's no way her smile can be any bigger . " I 'm so excited , I ca n't believe it . I 've been waiting forever to find out who I am . " " Well , I hope you already know that , " I say , making a big display of my wisdom . " What you 're going to learn is who you 've been . " She giggled up a storm and out came those dimples . Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this woman . Should 've skipped the retropod and grabbed her up right then and there . Instead , I gave silent thanks to Chaudhary and Ostheim . Chaudhary proved the existence of the human soul , Ostheim isolated it , and some forty years after the fact , Stark was taking full advantage with what had to be the greatest pickup line ever : Come on over . All the regression you want , on the house . It never failed . Not once . Sam turns up just after midnight . " I hope you 're hungry , " she says , and stashes a brown bag under my arm . I unwrap the package and down a quarter of the club in two bites . The bacon is crisp . The turkey smoky . The mayonnaise generous . Just the way I like it . " Ketchup ? " she asks . I squirt a packet over the fries . " Mountain Dew , right ? " I nod , pop the can . She props her elbows on the counter and takes in the scene . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sundays are funny . Some weeks it 's packed , others dead . " My mouth is full , so I 'm not expecting her to make out a word I 've said , but she understands everything ; the experience of working in a diner , I guess . " It 's the heat . Everybody 's cranky . People ca n't sleep . " " Nah , that 's not it . Not here . Come nightfall , we draw the loonies - hot or not . Trouble is , you ca n't predict when they 'll come out to play . " I check the main board to see who 's up and who 's winding down . All the lights are a go , but most are either into REM Six or skimming nowtime . " Should n't be long , " I assure her . " We 'll have the place to ourselves by one . " The neon blinking on the far wall catches her eye and I know what she 's going to ask before she asks it . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think I might get a tan too ? " Her smile is tentative . No doubt she figures I 'm an easy mark ; she 's not wrong . And you can be sure I would have thrown in the tan had I been able . I explain how the sign should 've come down years ago . Hadley 's was one of the original PastPJus Regression Parlors - there were a bunch of them - but the Plus did n't work out . Simultaneous tanning and regressing never caught on . " Of course , immortality was still a novelty back then . " " It 's still a novelty to me , " she says . " I 'm not saying it 's not fun , Sam . Addictive too . You just do n't want to let it become an obsession . Some people , I tell you .... " " So who have you been , Nate , besides who you are now ? " Strange , I think , she 's never asked before . I 'm telling you , she was special . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they learned where I worked . Usually I 'd bullshit , drop a couple of nondescript lifedocs - nobodies just boring enough to get the conversation moving in another direction . But with Sam , I decided to play straight . After all , if this relationship was going where I hoped , she might as well like me for who I am instead of who I 'd been . Or , more correctly , who I had n't been . They say the best part about dying is the coming back . But I did n't know , and thought I never might . Truth is , the only past I 'd come up with began and ended in this Nathan Stark lifedoc . Fifteen centuries of nothing , and counting . I 'd accepted it . Almost . What was my choice ? Make the most of life in life and hope for the best in death . I 'd tried the pods a thousand times or more , but all I got was a sea of static . It was deep and blue , but static all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand before I gave up altogether . And probably another thousand after that . Hadley might have been tight with a buck , but he was real decent about letting staffers regress . After hours , of course . It was a perk of the job . The only perk . And , truth be told , the only reason I hung around , besides the money covering rent and three squares a day . And a guy never knew when another LWT like Tackaberry might come through the door and leave you three hundred grand or so , even on the night shift - even way down here in freakin " Freakville . So who have I been besides who I am now , she wants to know . I shrug , confess : " Nobody . " She 's not sure how to react . " Oh . " She looks down , embarrassed for me . Not a good sign . " How awful for you . " I try to put her at ease , retrieve my lost prestige . " Hey , I 'm used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't help but wonder if you 're a first-timer or a one-shotter . Like is this the beginning or the end ? And when you see some of the scumbags around here with multiple lives .... But , as my father used to say , " Nobody ever said Death is fair . " And so you just sort of come to accept it . I mean , when you really get down to it , Sam , whether you got a bunch of lifedocs or one , you still got to live in the here and now . " She kisses my cheek . " What was that for ? " " For you , " she says . " For the here and now . " A good sign , I think . LIKE I EXPECTED , the place is pretty much cleared by one . A couple of uptowners hang back , pushing me to run retrocheks on them . Why the hell they come to Hadley 's is beyond me ; for sure their neighborhood has fancier parlors than this . The woman is claiming she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - and the guy says he 's somebody named Benjamin Disraeli . He sees I 've drawn a blank and feels the need to clarify . " Earl of Beaconsfield . Prime Minister . Beloved confidante of Victoria , Queen of Great Britain and Ireland , Empress of India .... " Blah blah blah blah . " Yeah . Right . " Seems everybody has to have a Somebody in their lives . I scribble the details and fire off the retrocheks . " Might be a while , " I tell them . I take their money , but neglect to mention how the backlog for a Certificate of Past Life Authentication has stretched to over a year . " Yup , might be a while . " " I 'm not concerned , " the guy says . " My Marcus Fabius Quintilianus and Khalid ibn Abd al-Aziz came back positive and , most assuredly , my Disraeli shall achieve the same . " I do my best to act impressed , like I 'm supposed to know every damn big shot on the planet who 's ever croaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pop culture stuff . Like if he said he was Rudy Vallee or Kurt Cobain , I 'd be excited . " Would you know , perhaps , if any of my sisters have turned up in domains elsewhere ? " the woman asks . I stifle a yawn . " No idea , ma'am . " " Well , if they do , be sure to tell them I was here . " I shuttle the pair out the door , lock up , switch off the outside neon , and Sam and I are alone at long last . I set her up in Retropod Four . " So smooth , you wo n't even know the chip is in . " " I 'm nervous , " she says , " somewhere between utterly terrified and utterly excited . " " Utterly natural , " I assure her . " All that 'll be behind you the second you start diving . Trust me . " " I do , " she says . And this time it 's my turn to kiss her . I bypass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way she returns the favor has me doing all I can not to jump into the pod with her . Okay , I was either falling in love or already there ; does it matter which ? " What will you do while I 'm under ? " she asks . I 'm all moony-faced ; I can feel it in my eyeballs . " Do n't worry about me . Just go ahead and have fun . I 'll be here when you surface . Have a good life or two , Sam . " " I 'll do my best , Nate , " she says . I 'm tempted to kill time with a quickie regression while Sam 's off on hers , but decide not to risk it ; you never know when a retrorookie might implode over an unwelcome life . A couple of years before , I had two victims of this Chelmniecki Massacre thing turn up in the same week ; it got real messy , I can tell you . Trouble is , everybody jumps into the pods bubbling with optimism , hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ variation on Cleopatra , but 99.99999999% dig up nothing more than perpetual nobodyhood-peasants , serfs , plebes , pukes and fodder , from life-one to life-now . Because that 's what 99.99999999% of humanity has always been . And that , I suppose , is what keeps them coming back to Hadley 's . What 'd the boss once say ? " The emptier their lifedocs , the fuller my cashbox ? " Something like that , anyhow . Like I said , it all came down to the fact that everybody needs to be a Somebody . I did n't figure on Sam being any different ; I just hoped she was n't the type to wig out over being in that 99.99999999% . An hour in , Sam 's winging through REM Six and five minutes later she 's skimming nowtime . I tally up the cash and finish up in time to greet her . She 's crying with excitement , so much gushing , I 'm eyeing the mop propped in the corner . " The feeling , " she 's telling me . " The feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Next I know , she 's hugging me tight and painting my face with kisses . " Thank you , thank you , thank you .... Oh , thank you . Nate . Thank you . That was the best birthday gift ever . " " My pleasure , " I say , giving thanks to Chaudhary and Ostheirn , yet again . " I 'm happy it worked out for you . " Naturally , I 'm curious about her lifedocs , but I 'm playing it cool . I do n't want to come on like some nosy ass , even if all signs point to our being in the sack together by sunup . I mean , it 's the soul searcher 's decision whether or not to share past lives , after all . Basic etiquette . " You wo n't believe who I am , " she says . " I know who you are . " I pull her close , give her a hug and kiss . Sure enough , out come the giggles and the dimples . She was really something special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . I 'm a bit taken aback . I 'd never heard her curse before , after all . And though I do n't claim to be the world 's greatest kisser , I 'd never had a woman complain because of it . " Was it that bad ? " I ask . " No , no . Jesus , " she says . " You know , of Nazareth . That 's who I am . I 'm Jesus . " " Right . " She 's pulling my leg . Still , I tell her point-blank . I mean , this is dangerous territory she 's treading in . " You ca n't be Jesus , so just calm down now . You can be anybody , but you ca n't be Jesus , okay ? It 's easy to get confused . Maybe you were a disciple . There was once this guy who came in here , this Mr. Tackaberry , and he turned out to be Bartholomew .... " " But I am Jesus . Honest , Nate . Run one of those checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reason with her . " If I do , they 'll come after you so fast you wo n't know what hit you . Nobody can be Jesus . Even if you are Jesus you ca n't be Jesus . " I tear the poster off the bulletin board and hold it up for her to see . " Look . Look at this list . Who 's at the top ? " " Me , " she says . " No , Sam . No . Come on now , read it . Who 's at the top ? " She 's not happy . " Jesus . " " Right . And what 's it say up here ? " " The Dead No One Can Be . ' " " Right . And what does it say down here ? " " ' Report offenders immediately . ' " " Now do you understand what I 'm trying to tell you ? " " Siddhartha . " " What ? " " The Buddha . I 'm also Siddhartha Gautama ; The Buddha . " I skim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number six . I mean , what 's she trying to pull ? " You 're not funny . " I search her face for the slightest trace of mischief , a twinkle in her eye or something . " I 'm not trying to be funny , Nate . You 've got to believe me . I am Jesus and I am The Buddha . " I take her by the shoulders . Not roughly or anything , but firm enough to make it clear I mean business . I look her right in the eyes - those big , beautiful eyes . " You are Sam , the waitress . Period . You got that ? " After all my flirting and whatnot , I realize I still do n't know her last name . Unlike mine , her nametag does n't tell the whole story . Then she comes out with , " Muhammad . " " Stop , " I tell her . " No , honest . Muhammad . " Hell , he 's number three on the list , right after this L. Ron Hubbard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . I crack right up . What a dope ! " I get it . I get it . Okay , okay . " She 's got a terrific sense of humor , but I never expected she 'd pull one over on me this good . Sherky always complained how I took my job too seriously . I run down the list . " And I suppose you 're Abraham , Confucius , and Adolf Hitler too ? " I 'm laughing . " I am certainly not Hitler , thank you . At least , not yet . As for the others , how did you know ? Mind you , I much prefer K'ung-Fu-tzu to Confucius , the Christian appellation . " All right , time to stop fooling around . I wave the poster like it 's my battle flag . " For crying out loud , you 're claiming to be everybody you ca n't be . And on your first dive . Why not throw in Napoleon and Mao and Osama and Attila and Genghis Khan and Mary and Joseph too ? Or John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cleopatra ? Why not Cleopatra ? Every second nut-job is Cleopatra . " " Because , Nathan , I am none of them . If I were , I would have had to have been living two or three lives at once . And even I know a soul can occupy only one body at a given .... " " Stop . Just stop . " " Why are you behaving this way ? Do you know how much I have learned - how much I have to share with the world ? It is as if I 've been reborn after twenty-one years . And it 's only the beginning . Imagine who else I am . I want to go back . I want to go back right now . " " You 're not going anywhere . " " What are you talking about ? " I do my best to level with her . " Look , if you claimed to be Jesus , alone , I 'd be obligated to turn you in . It 's the law . But I like you , Sam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So , maybe , if you keep it to yourself , I can let it pass . You know , chalk it up to retrorookie hysteria or something . But bringing all these other lifedocs into it .... I mean , you 're putting me in a real awkward position here . " " But I am telling you the truth . " " Truth does n't mean a thing ; only the law matters . You just ca n't claim to be all those lives . " " Why ? " " Because . " " I know what I experienced , Nathan . " " Right . Jesus and Muhammad sharing the same soul . And some other Jewish guy too . Come on , get off it . " " It would appear my soul harbors a singular aptitude for developing and conveying complex systems of belief , not to mention the gift of gab . What can I say ? Do you expect me to deny who I am ? " " Yeah , I do . Jesus , were n't you anybody normal ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for who I am now . And perhaps even this may be about to change . Since I was little , I 've known there was more inside of me , that I was n't only who I appeared to be .... " She 's pouting . Sexiest pout I 'd ever seen . Talk about lousy timing . " Run those checks on me . You 'll see . I can read Sanskrit . And German .... Did I mention I was Moses ? " " For God 's sakes , listen . All your lifedocs can come back authentic and they 'll still lock you up . Do n't you get it ? Some dead you just ca n't be . Period . No ifs , ands , or buts about it . " " I do n't understand . " " So much for your so-called aptitude for complex systems of belief .... " " Do not doubt me , Nathan . The laws of mankind are hardly complex . They are arbitrary and frivolous , concocted by malfeasantly pious martinets all too eager to subvert and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop calling me Nathan . It 's Nate . Plain Nate . And besides , I did n't get a word you just said . " " Put simply : only the laws of the Gods are true laws . " " The Gods ? Did you say'the Gods ' ? " " Monotheism has been vastly overstated . I should have been more precise when I first broached the concept . " " What ? " " And that is but a tiny fraction of the knowledge I have to share . You have no idea the extent to which my teachings have been corrupted .... " " See . That 's what I 've been trying to tell you . Lifedocs like yours are nothing but trouble . They make people think things they do n't need to think . Gets them rethinking what they think they already know . No matter what anybody says , nobody wants another Jesus or Buddha running around . Not even the flake-a-zoids who live and breathe the stuff . In their hearts maybe - yeah - but not in their heads . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hell comes in many flavors . " " Again . That 's exactly what I mean . " " Well , it does . " " It does n't matter . You 've got to keep your lives to yourself . Christ , you 're some kind of fluke record-holder , I tell you - all those lives wrapped into one soul . Jesus and Buddha . Who else did you say - Muhammad ? " " K'ung-Fu-tzu . Abraham . Moses . And , oh yes ! Joseph Smith . " I should 've turned her in . Instead , I walked her home . She was pretty adamant about coming out , telling the world who she 'd been and all the new stuff she had to share - revelations , insights , and assorted whatnot . I told her to keep her voice down too many times to count . The streets might look deserted at that hour , but you never know who 's listening . Her biggest dilemma was where to begin , which lifedoc was most likely to pave the way for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've got to promise me you 'll keep your mouth shut about this . " " And if I do n't ? " " They 'll put you away . " " And then ? " " I do n't know . Nobody does . " " I am not afraid . I am accustomed to persecution . " " I have no doubt . " " And ye shall know the truth , and the truth shall make you free . " " What ? " " Something I once said . " " Well , do you promise ? " " Maybe . " " Maybe ? " " It depends on you .... " A coy Jesus was n't anything I 'd figured on . " Yeah ? What ? " " Tomorrow night , after I get off work , you 'll let me go again . " " No way . Not after - " She rose to her tiptoes , pressed her lips against mine , and just sort of hung there , my arms and mouth pretty much keeping her suspended . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept saying . And finally I did . How she dug out her keys and unlocked her door I do not know . All I 'm going to tell you is we did n't let go the whole night long . SHOULD THE LIFE OF SAM ever come to be written , take note : if Nate Stark is n't front and center as a major prophet , apostle , brethren , or whatever they call the key guys , chalk up the job as bogus . Because after my performance , Sam was up to her ears in revelations . I do n't mean to boast , but I took her places no man had taken her before , believe you me . Well , no mortal man , anyhow . And no man in her current lifedoc . Yeah , I might have been slow on the draw - it took me four months to get this far , after all - but it was clear that pacing myself was more than worth it . Best of all , I learned her full name , and there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My girlfriend , Jesus . Monday night is dead . Just as well , seeing how little I 'd slept . Most who wander in are grungies from the area , clutching HALF-LIFE MONDAY coupons in bony fists : Wow ! A 1-hour regression for the price of a half-hour ! Hadley 's failed plan to jumpstart the week . Maybe it worked in the burbs , but not in the core . Here , Mondays belong to the bars . Happy Hour from five to five - you just ca n't beat it . Anyhow , I 've barely punched in when Hadley drops by to collect the daytime receipts . Asks if I 'm still a nobody . I nod and he gives me that phlegmy laugh of his : " Was that you doing a freebie on Four last night ? " " Yeah , " I lie . As usual , he 's been snooping through the logs . The logs , of course , provide only a rough picture of the dive ; the specifics are left to the history rats , should there be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your problem , Stark . You surf like a retrorookie-here , there , everywhere . What did you cover - six , seven thousand years in the session ? " " I guess . " " You 'll never get a life at that rate , son . Go decade by decade . Or focus on the big pops - your Indias , your Chinas . Everybody has a lifedoc from one of them . I 've got two or three myself , though you 'd never know it from my Hindi and Mandarin . " I tell him I 'll give it a try , but fact is , he 's got me wondering about Sam . Had she come up empty7 . Was that what her crazy claims were all about ? Had she been too ashamed to tell the truth , blurting out the first lifedocs that came to mind instead ? She 'd hardly be the first to have lied about the past - or lack thereof . Like I said , nobody wants to be a nobody . Especially nobodies . I take my break . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra big slice , but other than that , she acts same as always . No hint of anything from the night before , except her rosy cheeks , slinky grin , and parting words : " So I 'll see you later then , Nate - as promised ? " She 's wearing her hair in a ponytail . Another of my weaknesses . This time , I set her up in Retropod Eleven - an old LifeLiner . It may not have all the bells and whistles or the speed of aDeepDrifter , but there 's no questioning its reliability . If you 've got any past life at all , Eleven will deliver . Sam emerges subdued , with none of the enthusiasm from the night before . The color is gone from her cheeks . " Was it that bad ? " I ask , without pushing too hard . " Look , I know what it 's like to come up empty . I 'm here for you . " She pretty much snaps my head off . " Is that what you think - that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I - uh - " " Have you heard of Baha'u'llah ? Or Zoroaster ? " I glance over to the wall and the poster , looking for names that come close to what I think she just said . I am relieved to find none . No Baha . No Lulu . No Zorro . No Aster . " It would seem I am also the soul responsible for Baha'i and Zoroastrianism . " " And these guys are like Jesus and Moses and the others ? " I 'm trying , but I ca n't shake my doubt . I mean , how many religious bigwigs can one body be ? " There 's something else , " she says . " Tell me . " She shakes her head . " But you 've told me everything .... " " This is different . " " What ? So you 're Hitler , after all ? Is that it ? " Okay , so maybe being funny was n't the best strategy just then , mostly since , I guess , it was n't all that funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . But it might be better if I were . " " Then what ? Tell me . You can trust me . " Actually , I 'm not entirely convinced she can . I worry I might turn her in if she starts stirring up too much trouble . I hoped I would n't , of course , but you never know until the chips are down . " I need to go again . " " Sam .... " " Now . Tonight . But on a different machine . " " Look , if you 're coming up empty .... " " I told you , I am not . When you doubt , I prefer you abstain . " " Huh ? " " Sorry . Zarathustra speaking . " " What ? " " Nothing . Look , Nathan - Nate - I need to do this . Please . More than you can imagine . I need to . " She raises the shield on Retropod Three and starts to climb in . To make matters worse , I help her . Harness her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid , dumb-ass , criminal nine yards . Anyhow , it went on like this for hours . She 'd go into a dive and come up fifteen , twenty minutes later , looking glum as rain . And then she 'd hop right into another machine . Did n't even bother asking anymore . She just assumed I 'd set her up and get her going , which , I guess , is what I did . I 'd never seen anything like it . Most soul searchers are whipped after an hour and I 'd never once seen anybody go longer than two-I mean , a person can handle only so many past lives at a time , and once you reach your threshold , the brain shorts out or something . Hadley called it the **26;2562;TOOLONG syndrome ; he chuckled every time he said it , but I did n't have a clue why . Anyhow , to put it mildly , Sam was driven . By sunup she 'd been into and out of every retropod in the place at least twice . Man , what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to make sense of the logs for that night . We 're in Calv 's , pretty much the scuzziest diner in the neighborhood . The place is so dark and dreary , you 'd think it was the dead of night instead of the break of day . The dcor is your classic dinge with a soupon of yesterday 's sewer rat . On the upside , the aroma of bacon and coffee washes over us , and suddenly I realize how hungry I am . More hungry than tired , though tired enough . Now this is n't the diner where Sam waits tables , which , by comparison , is the frigging Ritz . Nope , Calv 's is that spectacular establishment under the El near Twenty-first Street . Sam figured it 'd give us some privacy , that we 'd be the only sober folk in the joint . She was right . Pretty much every other customer is sleeping it off , the snoring and wheezing a language unto itself . And if I did n't get a fix of caffeine into me real quick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I ask her if she really wants to stay . " We could go to my place , " I tell her . " Or yours . " I mean , if it 's privacy she wants .... " I ca n't go home . They may already know about me . They always find out sooner or later . " " Who ? " " The people who do n't want me around . It 's my history . You know - ridicule , proscription , assassination , crucifixion .... And now they 'll have even more reason to rid themselves of me . " I look at her like it 's somebody else 's head screwed onto her body . " Nobody knows anything . Except when the machines were used and for how long . The history rats wo n't snoop unless you start making noise or somebody tips them off . Hadley wo n't bother . He thinks it 's me who 's been going at it . " " Somebody will . " Her tone fell just short of accusation . " Are you saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the ones who inevitably betray me are those closest to me . " " But I 'd never - " " I have been the victim of gullibility as often as duplicity . No matter , the result is the same . " I 'm thinking I could use a dictionary when the waitress interrupts . " Keep it simple , kids , " she says , earring kabobs grazing her boobs , her boobs testing the limits of her buttons . " Willy has ten minutes to go and ai n't in no mood to be messin " with hotcakes and omelets . " I go for the bacon and eggs , Sam a carrot muffin . Coffee , too , of course . And plenty of it . The waitress winks and leaves the pot . " Why do they do that ? " I ask . " Why do so many waitresses wink ? " " Tips , " she says . " A well-timed wink almost always generates a superior tip . " " You never winked at me . " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So ? " I say . " So , " she says . " Are you going to tell me what 's going on ? " " Are you sure you want to hear ? " I look about for snoops , ears perking up , see none . Most heads remain buried in folded arms . " What could be worse than your being every major religious lifedoc for the last five thousand years ? " " Correction : the last thirty thousand years . And are you sure you really want to know what could be worse ? " " Why would n't I ? " " Are you a religious person , Nate ? " " Last time I set foot in a church was my sister 's wedding . And she married some Jewish guy , so it was n't a church exactly . " " Do you believe in Jesus ? " " I suppose . Whether he was really the son of God , I mean .... Well , who can say ? Except you , maybe . " " So you 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? " " I 'm wishy-washy on Him too . Sometimes , I guess . I 'd like to . I do n't know . It 's tough . He 's not exactly what you 'd call a great communicator these days . " " If , indeed , he ever was . " " What ? What do you mean by that ? " I lower my voice . " You are Jesus and Moses and all those other guys He was always speaking to - you are , are n't you ? " " Yes . And many others too . My lifedocs include just about every individual who led or inspired any sort of religious movement since the dawn of man . " " What - you 're Adam and Eve too ? " " My earliest is a woman named R'mu . I lived in a cave in what is now the south of France . Had quite the following , I might add , considering the time and place . Nice cave too , relatively speaking . " " So you 're even more of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea , " she says . " But that 's not the least of it . " " Oh , that 's plenty . " " I may also be the dead that are impossible to be . " " Huh ? " " Have you ever heard of Harry Angstrom ? " " What religion did he start ? " " Or Nausicaa ? Or Lady Capulet ? Or Bertie Cecil ? Norman Mushari ? Or how about Ho Hsien-Ku ? " " Bertie Cecil sounds familiar . " He did n't really , but I was still working to impress . " Sort of . " " The protagonist of Under Two Flags ? " " Oh . Oh , yeah . " I 've never been a convincing bluffer . " Goldilocks , then . Surely she rings a bell ? " " The Three Bears'Goldilocks ? " " The same . " " I do n't get it . " " Neither do I. " We clam up as the waitress sets our plates before us . " Anything else I can get you kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been downing mugs like there 's no tomorrow - which for Sam and me , just might be the case . " Can do , sweetheart . " Sam plucks a raisin from her muffin , examines it to make sure it really is a raisin - this is Calv 's , do n't forget - and pops it into her mouth . I dip my toast into the yolk . The waitress returns with a fresh pot . " I 'm stepping out back for a smoke , so if you kids need anythin ' , just holler . " I 'm an egg and two strips of bacon in before Sam finds the words to continue . " You see , Nate , last night , when I regressed for the second time .... " She raises her mug to her lips and takes a long slow gulp . " On the old LifeLiner . Number Eleven . " " Something funny started to happen . " " Ha-ha funny or oh-shit funny ? " " Remember , when I told you I am Baha'u'llah and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sure if she 's talking two names , four , or two teams of two - like Caesar/Cleopatra or Batman/Robin . " Well , here 's what troubles me : On that same dive , I learned I am also Harry Angstrom . " " He 's somebadguy ? Is that it ? " " Worse . He 's a character from a book - something called Rabbit Run . " " Yeah , so ? " " So ? So ? Do n't you get it ? Harry Angstrom is n't real . He never lived , except in the pages of John Updike novels . Just like Bertie Cecil . And neither did Nausicaa , Lady Capulet , Norman Mushari or Ho Hsien-Ku . If you 've read Homer or Shakespeare or Vonnegut or are in any way familiar with Chinese mythology , you 'd know . They 're all fictional characters from one era or another , one country or another . " " Like Goldilocks , Jesus . " " Yes , like Goldilocks . " " But that 's a fairy tale . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm a tad slow on the draw . " You ca n't be a fairy tale , Sam . " " Do n't you think I know ? But according to your retropods , I am plus several other individuals who never existed . And that 's in addition to all the dead you told me I can not be . That 's why I needed to try all the pods . I thought for sure something was wrong . A glitch . A malfunction . But the more I explored my past , the more I discovered . Every machine gave me the same . For every religious icon among my lifedocs , I have a fictional counterpart . But how is this possible ? How can I be people who never existed and , at the same time , people who did exist ? But do you know what disturbs me most , Nate ? " I swallow , shake my head . I 'm scared too , just not sure of what . " Either they are all real or none of them are . " " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a fictional character . The retropods , they trace past lives - real lives - not made-up lives . " " Could someone have tampered with Hadley 's machines ? " " All of them ? At once ? I do n't see how . But there 's an easy way to find out . How much money do you have on you ? " She pulls her wallet from her bag . " Not a lot . Twenty and change . But I 've got my bank card . " " No . We need cash . Bank cards are too easy to trace , if it should come to that . " I come up with another forty , convinced I am digging my own grave , so to speak . If you 're looking for integrity , state-of-the-art , and all that other gobbledygook , NirvanaLand has the market cornered . It 's the reason you 're finding fewer and fewer independents like Hadley 's . Anyhow , we head way uptown , as far from Freakville as the El goes . We play it cool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning is as natural as scratching . " It 's my girlfriend , " I tell the clerk , my wink not much different from the waitress at Calv 's . " When she gets the urge , she gets the urge . " But the guy does n't much care what I 'm saying , his eyes are on Sam . He takes our money and sets her up in a shiny new PastMaster . Jesus , the whole place is nothing but PastMasteis . Top of the line . Praised by Consumez Reports and whatnot . Capable of scanning more decades in a minute than most of Hadley 's pods can cover in ten . Even the magazines in the waiting zone are recent . But my mind is hardly on reading or even the centerfolds . My only concern is Sam and whether her lifedocs are bogus or legit - and , I guess , if Hadley 's pods are the same . The hour is a long one . SAM EMERGES with a poker face . Pleasant . Emotionless . As forgettable as a good-looking woman can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to me , loud enough for the clerk to hear . He wishes her better luck next dive and hands her a punch card that offers a free regression after she 's paid for five . The sort of promo Hadley should try . We are well away from the place , at rest on a bench in that solitary patch of green on the boulevard at Eighty-eighth and Eleventh , before she opens up . Traffic stops and goes on either side . The morning rush . Bumper to bumper , north and south . The heat , beginning its rise from pavement , is up to knee level . I can not say why , but I feel more removed from the scene than a part - as if Sam and I and the bench and the green are the image on the missing piece of a massive jigsaw . " Theresult , " shesays , " it was the same , Nate . " I get a sense she 's striving to come off low-key , to spare my feelings or something . Beneath the surface she seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong with Hadley 's pods ? " " No . " " Who were you this time ? " I brace for the worst , without a clue as to what the worst might be . " Iola Morton , Marduk , and Rishabha . " " Iola Morton , eh ? " I say , as if I know who the hell she 's come up with now . But my ignorance quickly gives way to curiosity . " Are any of them - you know - real ? " " Real ? By your definition , Rishabha alone would qualify . In his person , I am the first of the twenty-four Tirthankaras in the present age of decline in the heterodoxy of Jainism . " " Huh ? " With every dive she grows smarter , while I grow dumber . I can feel the brain cells draining from my ears . It 's like I 'm a student in a remedial **28;2590;TOOLONG class . No longer can I picture Sam in an apron , asking if I 'd care for a scoop of vanilla with my pie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ readers - a popular twentieth-century mystery series called The Hardy Boys-while Marduk is the hero of the Babylonian epic , Enuma Elish . " " I do n't get it . " " Neither did I , " she says . " Until now . The thing is , Nate , all my lifedocs are real . " " But you just said .... " " And all my lifedocs are fiction . It just depends on which side of the divide you stand . " She has barely begun to explain and I am lost . I zero in on the obvious . " You 're saying Jesus is fiction , then ? " I 'm edgy as hell , expecting the history rats to pull up curbside at any moment . " As the lives I 've led attest , my soul has always possessed a proclivity for revelation . It is about to demonstrate the same again . You have a choice , Nathan : You may leave me now and distance yourself as best you can , or you may hear me out and suffer the consequences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know anything more . She was scaring the crap out of me . All I wanted was to have the old Sam back . The club sandwich and Mountain Dew Sam . The ponytail Sam . The woman I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Sam . No , I did n't want another word about Jesus or Iola Morton or Goldilocks . So I ca n't for the life of me tell you why I said , " I want to know . I 've always been big on epiphany . " Frankly , I was n't sure what epiphany meant - do n't think I 'd ever used it in public before - but it struck me as a word she 'd appreciate . " We have always been taught that the retropods plot the travels and travails of the human soul upon this Earth , correct ? " " Yeah , sounds right . " " But what the pod creators - and we as mankind - have failed to grasp is that the journey a soul takes may extend beyond this Earth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifedocs be Martians ' ! " Notwithstanding those so-called fringe elements among us , mainstream divinity confines the physical manifestation of the soul to this world , this one dimension . But in practice , our soul traverses time and space , passing from one dimension to another , from one corporeal entity to the next . This accounts for the gaps in so many peoples " earthly timelines . Their souls have been elsewhere . " " But somebody would have noticed this before - all the soul searchers out there ? " " Experience is one thing , comprehension quite another . I am afraid , once again , enlightenment is left to me . I was the first to preach polytheism . The first to preach monotheism . The first to talk with a burning bush . The first to walk on water . By comparison , revealing the true nature of our souls will be a piece of cake . " " They wo n't let you get away with it . I 've told you , there 's some dead they just wo n't let you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another will manage to spread my word . Someone always does . " " But this time there 'll be no word to spread . You ca n't be both fact and fiction . No one will believe you - or in you . " " On the contrary , the two are fundamental to my message . Do you have imagination , Nathan ? " " Of course . Who does n't ? " Where the hell was she going now ? " You 'd be surprised . " She smiles and I yearn for her - and for what we had even more . " Imagination is not what you think it is - not what anyone thinks it is . For the most part , imagination is your soul 's recall of past lives and encounters . And no matter how outrageous the thoughts that enter your head , how sublime or horrific - from genies granting wishes to monsters crushing cars in downtown Tokyo - each is based on a reality of a past life lived not necessarily in this dimension , but in some other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my arms . I was starting to believe her . Hell , I wanted to believe her . " Then I 'm not a one-shotter ? " " In this dimension , probably yes . Nathan Stark may well be your first venture onto this particular plain . Chances are , your soul has spent most of its existence elsewhere . But do you want to know the most intriguing anomaly of all ? " She was n't looking for an answer ; still , I gave her one . " Yes . " " Jesus , Muhammad , Moses , Hubbard , and all the others we accept as historical and spiritual reality upon this Earth are the fictions of other dimensions - the beasts under the bed , so to speak . And Goldilocks , Iola Morton , Lady Capulet , Bertie Cecil and all the others we accept as fiction in the here and now have existed as living , breathing entities elsewhere . " " No way . That would make Dracula and Spider-Man and Lara Croft - they 'd all be real too somewhere . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as surely as Jehovah . " " This is crazy . If I follow what you 're saying , somewhere out there , I 'm a character in a story too ? " " You will be , yes . After you die and your soul passes on , Nathan Stark will enter the realm of fiction - a remnant of a past life reanimated as an imaginary life . It may be in a book , a comic , a film , a digital pastime , or a play . In dimensions less sophisticated , perhaps even oral tradition . My particular soul just happens to be literary in nature . Yours may well be more inclined to multimedia . " " You 're serious ? " " I have told you exactly as it has been revealed to me . The life you lead in one dimension becomes the stuff of fiction in the next . " " Jesus . " " I truly wish you would stop using my name in vain , Nathan . " " And I wish you would n't call me Nathan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we just sort of sat there , hand in hand , with nothing more to say . The words that finally broke the silence were mine . And it was n't along the lines of anything I usually said to girlfriends : " I 'm not sure how to tell you this , Sam , but you 've made me feel really good . You 've given me hope that there 's more to me than this . " " That 's what I do , " she said . " It is what I have always done . " They came for me that night . Sherky 's doings more than Hadley 's , so it seemed to me . Like he did n't act one bit surprised when they stormed in . And though I tried to take the fall , claim Jesus and the others as lives of my own - swear to God I did - I gave her up . I could n't help it . The history rats have their ways . And it was n't like they did n't know all along who she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they called their insurance . I got seven years . You know , aiding and abetting a soul searcher in the commission of an illicit lifedoc . Made it out in four . But the worst part was , I was banned from the retropods for life . This life , anyhow . Not even allowed to work in the industry , the only business I knew . But I guess it was n't all that big a deal , not after you consider what happened to Sam . Samantha Andrea Wallis . My Sam . She got-well , who the hell really knows ? They just put her away - shut her up good - and then one day some guy plants a shiv between her ribs . That was the word on the street anyhow . Some scummy named Wray Erling Dreng who 'd had it in not for her , but for me - all because I 'd once thrown him out of Hadley 's PastPjfus Regression Parlor in the heart of freakin " Freakville . Unless you 're lying on your deathbed or slipping into a noose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're speaking your last words when you come to speak them . That 's how it was with Sam and me . Well , maybe She knew it was to be our last conversation , but I sure did n't . It was after the bench and patch of green on the boulevard and we 'd come back down to the core . She said , " Maybe , someday , you 'll be the one to write about me . Imagine , the Gospel of Natha - Nate . " I laughed . " Gee , I do n't know , " I told Her . " I 've never fancied myself as a writer . Not in this Nathan Stark lifedoc , anyhow . Maybe I 'll just leave it to my next life . " We kissed and I gave Her the key to my place . " see you later then , " She said . And to this day , I have no doubt She 'll keep the promise . By my reckoning , it will be Her 372nd coming . Or His , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
