When biologists study food theft among endangered roseate terns , they find that crime most definitely pays <p> PATROLLING THE JUNE SKIES above Long Island Sound 's tiny Falkner Island , one roseate tern spies another flying 15 feet below with a fish in its beak . The first bird dives , grabs the fish and repairs to a nearby pebbly beach to feed its chicks . <p> " That 's Supertern , " says biologist Dave Shealer of the fish thief . " Good catch ! " says Shealer 's colleague , Jeff Spendelow , who , peering through a spotting scope , reads an identifying number on a band around the bird 's leg . The men  --  Shealer , a 37-year-old behavioral ecologist based at Loras College in Dubuque , Iowa , and 53-year-old Spendelow , a U.S. Geological Survey research biologist at Maryland 's Patuxent Wildlife Research Center  --  are shoulder to shoulder in a small bird blind on the island 's north end . <p> Thanks to these two researchers , Supertern and several other Falkner Island roseate terns are among science 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Greek word kleptes , meaning thief . The practice of stealing food to feed themselves , their young or a mate-common to other bird species such as frigate birds , parasitic jaegers , skuas and several types of gulls  --  was first noticed in roseate terns in 1973 . But Shealer and Spendelow 's recently published research has shed new light on this unorthodox behavior . They have found that , contrary to conventional wisdom , crime does pay  --  at least among roseate terns . <p> Spendelow and Shealer 's " laboratory , " about three miles off the Connecticut coast , is a slip of an island consisting of four and a half acres of rocky beach , poison ivy , six-foot-high black mustard plants and staghorn sumac trees . The north end of the banana-shaped island rises 60 feet from the sea like the prow of a ship ; the island 's midsection is marked by a 200-year-old working lighthouse . But birds dominate the landscape : nearly 3,000 pairs of common terns and 45 pairs of their smaller , endangered cousins , the roseates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roseates have a slightly rosy breast that glows " with the faintest blush of some rare seashell , " wrote early 20th-century ornithologist Arthur C. Bent . Their effortlessness in the air prompted John James Audubon to describe them as " the Hummingbirds of the sea . " <p> Spendelow first began studying roseates on Falkner 25 years ago . In 1987 , he devised an ingenious system of banding that did not require recapturing the birds to identify them : unique combinations of colored plastic bands that can be seen with a spotting scope from as far as 75 yards away Spendelow estimates that he and his colleagues have outfitted more than 50,000 roseates in Connecticut , Massachusetts and New York with these bands . Using this system , Spendelow has been able to make detailed histories of thousands of individual roseates and monitor the ups and downs of their population . <p> In 1994 , Spendelow invited Shealer to come to Falkner . Shealer had just spent four summers researching how roseates in Puerto Rico forage for food and had observed some terns stealing fish from others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shealer felt that Spendelow 's banding system would enable him to distinguish one bird from another and thus answer this question . <p> During the next four years on Falkner , Shealer would fold his 6-foot-1 frame into the bird blind for a total of 774 hours to watch the terns . " When you get to know them as individuals , you ca n't help but anthropomorphize , " he says . " There 's one that abuses her offspring , one that acts like he 's God 's gift to terns , another that loves mackerel . There are devoted parents , and a male that courts anything that moves . " <p> Shealer found that Heptoparasitism is indeed a way of life for some roseates , if only for two males and eight females , or 4 percent of what was then Falkner Island 's nesting roseate population . The thieves employed a number of scams and tricks . Supertern and a female dubbed the Good Mother swooped on their quarry from above or slashed from below . Other klepto terns  --  sly as purse snatchers  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few crafty females bided their time until a neighbor arrived home with a fish , then blocked the neighbor 's access to its chicks and grabbed the fish . " One brazen female actually solicited sex repeatedly , " Shealer adds . She would flirt with a fish-laden male by being submissive and begging , behavior that is a prelude to mating . " When the foolish male would fall for it and attempt a mounting on her back in preparation for copulation , " says Shealer , " she tilted her head upward , snatched the fish from the distracted suitor and took off without so much as a backward glance . " <p> There were other surprises . Shealer and Spendelow often watched Supertern bring several fish in rapid succession to his mate . Once she was satiated , he would then fly off to visit other , single females . After copping a fish from some unsuspecting tern , he 'd offer the stolen fish  --  the tern equivalent of a box of chocolates  --  to female after female , until he won what biologists call " extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be surprised if Supertern fathered half of the chicks " of single females on the island . <p> Klepto terns also make good parents . Honest terns bring their chicks only two young three-inch-long sand lance fish per hour . But Supertern , for example , can bring his mate 's offspring up to 20 per hour . Consequently , Supertern and the nine other thieving parents have healthier chicks , which are far more likely to survive and have chicks of their own . This , says Shealer , makes the outlaws the big winners in the game of life , where success is measured by the ability of individuals to pass their genes along to the following generation . <p> But do the birds also pass along their thieving ways ? Apparently not . Shealer and Spendelow have yet to see the offspring of a klepto tern resort to stealing . Many questions about kleptoparasitism remain : Why , for example , do terns steal rather than fish for themselves ? What are the effects on honest roseates in the population ? <p> Sitting in the blind , watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just as no two humans are alike , he says , neither are two birds . A bird that sees its neighbor fly in with a fish might be tempted to steal it , he says , " but I believe that kleptoparasitism is not just a matter of opportunism . " Nor , he says , is it laziness  --  a way to avoid the up to an hour-long , 25-mile round-trip flight out to sea to search for sand lances . Perhaps , Shealer speculates , some birds simply discover that they are good at stealing . It does , after all , require exquisite skill , speed and timing . Others might lack the ability and give up after trying once or twice . <p> Whatever motivates terns to steal , it 's clear that " kleptoparasitism is not a loser 's strategy , " says Shealer . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : On Falkner Island , part of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife 's Stewart B.
