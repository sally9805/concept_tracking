1 . The boy they called Heck arrived at Omaha Beach in August 1944 . Soon he would be sent to the front , but for now he waited for his papers to be processed at the Third Replacement Depot . He felt lonely , nervous , bored . Men were everywhere here , unloading supplies , bringing in artillery and armor , moving off for the front , coming back bandaged or in boxes , or , like Heck , waiting . The scene had a hivelike quality , vehicles and men streaming through this portal into and out of the interior of France . Amid all the activity , with everything in transition , it was easy to feel alone . Men were sent forward every day ; every day new men arrived . While he awaited orders Heck had few demands on his time . He wandered the crowded , churned sand of the beach , watched the ships slowly come and go , watched the formations of Allied planes pass overhead , their multitudinous drone burrowing into his bones , their glinting wings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw men who had lost as much as a hand or an eye who smiled at the prospect of going home . He saw the drivers of the army 's ubiquitous two-and-a-half ton trucks poring over their maps with the intensity of generals preparing for battle , and a GI told him that when getting off one of these deuce-and-a-half trucks an infantryman could calculate precisely how much danger he was in by watching how fast the driver turned around and got out of there . The landscape along and just beyond the beach had been reduced to a shambles of destructionmany locals had been living for a couple of months in tents set up inside houses without walls or ceilings while others patched their war-wounded homes with scavenged woodand bits of cloth . They stood sullenly in lines waiting for the soldiers to distribute food to them , and they looked at Heck without pleasure or greeting . It appeared they had had enough of armed combatants of any sort . Sometimes one could purchase from them a kind of hard cider with an under flavor like spoiled milk . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreaded being sent forward : the two emotions alternated and on occasion commingled into a single piercing physical ache . He tried to listen only to his ennui and to have no other feeling . At his first meal in the mess tent the men had been discussing a replacement who had shot himself in the foot . A large group of GIs were loud and indignant , and they hooted when one of them mocked in a simpering tone the wounded man 's woeful tale of a weapon that had discharged while he was cleaning it . The comment of a sergeant , shaking his head over the mess that the replacement had made of his foot , was repeated : " You at least could have taken off your boot and sock first . " However , Heck also heard four or five soldiers asking each other , softly : What were the chances that this man would have to go before a court-martial ? Would his foot heal up ? Would he be treated differently in the hospitals ? If he got prison time , how much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man 's fate might be , it would likely be better than ending dead at the bottom of a muddy hole in an anonymous field in northern France . Heck listened and tried to give no sign of listening . When he had been drafted Heck was already strong from summers of farm labor . He had always been tall . By nature he knew how to accept orders , even exasperating or obviously unnecessary orders , and he knew how to work uncomplainingly at tedious and exhausting tasks . He could shoot a gun . He felt a personal belief in the value of work and discipline . Watching some of the men struggle in training he had experienced a mild contempt . While others complained and swore bitterly , it all seemed to him simple , empty , dull . At the same time , however , he felt uncertain of himself . He knew that the training was just playacting , and the thought of a real battle created a fear in hima fear he tried to avoid by directing his attention to the details of his tasks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rural Iowa accent . Most of the other GIs seemed far more sophisticated and worldly than himself , even if they had n't fired a gun before . Heck tended to speak softly . He was balding already , and although he was just eighteen many of the other GIs assumed he was older than themselves . He listened to the conversations around him and watched the card games but rarely participated . But he did what he could to help , pointing out an open button on his neighbor 's shirt prior to inspection , helping another who could n't get the pieces of his M-1 together again after a cleaning . The other men did n't seem to know quite what to make of him , and accepted his help with uncertain smiles . They called him Heck because he never cussed . He knew he seemed an odd character , with his quiet and his air of indifference , but he felt he did n't know how to be otherwise . Sometimes he envied the men who talked and joked together so easily . But there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy and false companionships he saw among the men around him . Solitude seemed to him to be his natural condition . When he had completed training he was given a short leave and he went home . He arrived alone at the familiar little house and waited the rest of the day for his father to come home from work . In the window the sky deepened to black . When his father finally came in , they embraced , and Heck felt uncomfortably large and strong . His father seemed pale and exhausted . He asked Heck why he had not turned on the lights , and Heck shrugged . His father and a partner wrote and published the county newspaper . For as long as he could remember , Heck and his father had woken early every morning and eaten breakfast together . Then his father went to the newspaper office and most often he did not return again until eight or nine in the evening , or later . He kept books and magazines piled in stacks and heaps like small hills around the house . Heck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child . During the first dozen years of his life they had moved every year or two in search of work , around the Midwest and the Plains States , disrupting Heck 's friendships each time ; he had learned to do without . His father had a small round potbelly , but otherwise was pale , thin , and rather short , so Heck 's size seemed to have come from his mother . She had been a woman of great power in the shoulders and arms , taller than her husband by several inches , with a thick face and wide hips . She was moody . When her mood was good , she would joke and laugh with great energy , and whatever small thing was at hand she would toss over and over again into the air . When her mood was poor she said little , her expression turned dour , and her movements became economical . Heck always sought to keep her mood up . Even when he had grown as tall as she was , she never ceased to address him as though he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she called him , fondly , and in her good moods she would narrate whatever she was doing as though he were in a swaddled bundle at her breast . " Now we 're going to heat some water , Baby . And now while the water is heating we 'll clean some space on the counter " And Heck , sitting at the kitchen table with a magazine , felt reassured listening to her . When he was fourteen , his mother died , very suddenly , of a cancer . It happened in the springtime , and Heck 's father soon returned to his work . He hired a woman to clean on weekends , and he sometimes came home even later in the evenings with the smell of whiskey on him , but his established routines were otherwise unaffected . Heck , however , abruptly stopped reading the books and magazines and newspapers around the house that he had pored over in the past . The meanings of the words had suddenly become strangely variable , as if they crawled on the page like ants . That summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He engaged the labor with steady resolve , and because he worked hard he found himself accepted . He felt he fit in . He often returned home nearly as late as his father did . He was already tall , and now the work created muscles that filled out his form . After the daily , inflexible routines of army training camp , his week at home felt like nothing but a period of empty waiting . Heck did not tell his father about his new nickname , and everything here seemed to be just as it always had been . His father still had his way of smiling that appeared apologetic , or half sad . Heck went a couple of times to the little cemetery where his mother was buried . To earn extra money he worked for several days on one of the farms . It was summer and they were happy for the help . He felt glad when the day to depart came . His father took the time off work , and Heck rode beside him in the old Packard toward the train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be heard rolling and sliding in the trunk . The farmland around them curved like the fabric of a vast wind-whipped flag . His father said , " This war ca n't go on forever . " " No . It ca n't , " Heck said . He added , " I 'll be all right . " His father had been too young for the Great War . When Pearl Harbor had been bombed and America had declared war , Heck had assumed that he would miss this war in the same way . He had not grasped then that a war could go on for years and years . The windows were open and air tumbled into the Packard , moist and thick with the smell of earth . Waves of heat distorted the line of the road . Heck looked at his father and saw he was crying . He looked away . He had seen his father cry only two or three times before and the image now made him feel both heartbroken and strangely exhilarated . He was uncertain whether he ought to cry too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did not feel any tears in himself . Instead he felt only a nervous agitationa vibration in his stomach distinct from and more subtle than the rattling of the Packard . He had no real desire to go to war , but if he must then he wanted to do it quickly . He did not , after all , know what else he wanted to do with his life . Still , it seemed strange he could be sent to war . In truth , he thought of himself as hardly more than a boy , and he possessed an instinctive self-awareness of his own ignorance about many things . His father said , " Keep your hands clean . Do what they tell you ; do n't do anything stupid . Remember there 's a difference between being brave and being stupid . " " I will . " The advice seemed a sign of his father 's distress ; his father never gave general advice like this . His advice was rare and always specific . " Look sharp and be sharp . " " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rows of two-story brick buildings and storefronts . They parked at the train station and sat on a bench in the sun and waited . The train was late . They sat fidgeting , the duffel bag between them . Heck 's father got up and paced and kicked small stones with the toe of his shoe . His tears were gone . " Dad , " Heck said , " why do n't you go on home . " " Ah , no , " said his father . " You do n't need to wait here with me , doing nothing . " His father glanced at his watch . " I know you have work that needs to be done , " Heck said . " Maybe I better , " said his father . Heck stood , they shook hands , and his father got in the Packard and left . Heck was relieved . He waited for the train alone and when it came the car he sat in was empty and this made him happy . He traveled by train to Chicago , then New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hudson River pier into the Atlantic . He had never seen the ocean before . It was an incredible sight , the sea , which he had read of so often , more vast and mutable than anything he had imagined . When the enormous ship heaved and moved under him he had the sensation of transition , of leaving behind not only a continent but all his past as well . He felt the life he was abandoning now to be a mystery to him , as if he were somehow disassociated from it , and it appeared very small to him and easily left behind . And yet , the open space and the immeasurable sky at sea also reminded him of home . He stood on deck and gazed , recalling intensely the brown-black fields , furrowed and moist with spring rain , things happening invisibly beneath the surface , seeds exploding in slow motion , life struggling toward open air . Open spaces seemed to him particularly ennobled , as if God hovered down closer to such places . Many of the soldiers on the ship were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and retching such that they could not even crawl from their bunks to the mess for food , food that anyway would not have remained long in their stomachs . Heck was surprised he did not share their fate , but the motion of the ship did not bother him at all . What he moved toward , however , remained a great enigma . He understood he might never return to America , that indeed he might die . These were true possibilities . He looked around and said to himself , These men do n't truly understand that they might diethey do n't truly believe it , in their hearts they believe It wo n't be mebut I understand , it is true , I could die . Understanding this made him especially quiet and still . He began smoking cigarettes . As often as possible he went up to the deck and stood at the rail to watch the sea . On a cloudless day , with horizon in all directions , it appeared they had arrived into the center of eternity . At night it would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the ship , were swaying . Below him , the wave tips caught the moonlight and winked with the patterns of a complex intelligence . By day the waves carved countless , relentless , boundless sculptural forms , and the water acquired every conceivable shade from black to white and blue to green and , lit by the fires of sunset or the embers of sunrise , violet to scarlet to gold to mud to orange . Heck could gaze upon this extraordinary expanse and achieve a quietude from within which he might contemplate his approaching fate without fear . Indeed , he thought he had defeated his fear entirely , but he was wrong in this , for as soon as he was below decks , away from the hypnotic quality of the waters , the fears resurged . I should have been a sailor , he thought , and I never would have been afraid .
