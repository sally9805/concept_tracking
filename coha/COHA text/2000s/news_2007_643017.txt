<p> MARAVICH <p> <p> By Wayne Federman and Marshall Terrill <p> in collaboration with Jackie Maravich . <p> Illustrated . 422 pp . Sport Classic Books . $24.95 . PISTOL <p> The Life of Pete Maravich . <p> By Mark Kriegel . <p> Illustrated . 381 pp . Free Press . $27 . <p> On May 3 , 1989 , I popped a VHS tape into my machine and recorded an entire game of the Chicago Bulls and Michael Jordan to save for posterity . It was an ordinary first-round playoff game against the Cleveland Cavaliers , admittedly a team Jordan often torched , but I had no idea what would happen . Jordan ended with 44 points and delivered a few signature moments  --  a steal and a breakaway dunk , a series of fadeaway jumpers , an end-to-end rebound , sprint and layup . In an ESPN world of quick-cut highlights where a player 's dunk dissolves into the next clip before he hits the ground , I wanted to preserve what snippet-sports often denies us : context . While the most sensational exploits of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass ( Julius Erving 's behind-the-backboard layup , Willie Mays 's over-the-shoulder catch ) , the proof of greatness often lies in their ability to amaze every day . Arguably , no basketball player , not even Jordan , met that test as regularly as Pete Maravich , whose between-the-legs assists and next-ZIP-code jumpers still defy belief . Too bad he played mostly pre-VCR . <p> <p> Even a casual fan may know of Maravich 's trademark floppy socks and hair and his college scoring average of 44.2 points per game during his three years at Louisiana State University , a record as seemingly unassailable as Joe DiMaggio 's 56-game hitting streak . The more ardent will know Maravichiana like his idiosyncratic ball-handling drills , an obsessive practice ethic that found him sitting in aisle seats at movie theaters so he could dribble while he watched , and a checkered pro career marked by injury , coaching turmoil , frequent drinking and , most of all , losing . After retiring from the pros , he embraced evangelical Christianity and died unexpectedly in 1988 at the age of 40 , owing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent biographies  --  one by Mark Kriegel , the author of " Namath , " and the other a team effort from the actor and comedian Wayne Federman and the journalist Marshall Terrill , with an assist from Maravich 's widow , Jackie Maravich  --  cover this material baseline to baseline , with admirable thoroughness . In " Maravich , " Federman et al . assay a more exhaustive ( and occasionally exhausting ) approach , dutifully summarizing statistics in parentheses , front-loading each chapter with not one but two epigraphs and stacking up repetitive encomiums . Once you 've had the Hall of Famer and onetime Maravich coach Elgin Baylor say , " Pete is the best I 've ever seen , " do we really need to hear the same from a dozen others ? But its labor-of-love enthusiasm is infectious , and it 's essential for Maravich completists , especially for the reassessment of his pro career and for anecdotal feats of basketball wizardry , like his delivering on a boast to hit 100 jumpers from beyond 25 feet without missing two in a row . It also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Maravich was a selfish gunner : in the N.B.A. , when he scored more than 40 points , his team won 82 percent of its games , compared with Jordan 's 69 percent and Allen Iverson 's 68 . <p> Kriegel 's prose is flashier but often errant . A young Maravich is described as having " a big head mounted on a wispy frame , dense as a wafer " ; the Maravich-as-Elvis theme is hammered ad nauseam ; and one chapter in " Pistol " has the truly awful title " The Unbearable Whiteness of Being Pete . " But Kriegel does uncover some nuggets otherwise lost to history , as when he traces one inspiration for Maravich 's dribbling drills to a ball-handling sensation named Ah Chew Goo , whom Pete 's father , Press , had seen when stationed in Hawaii in the service . <p> Kriegel also tries to situate Maravich in his times , particularly in relation to the era 's racial dynamics . Despite the precedent of Bob Cousy 's legerdemain , Maravich 's crowd-pleasing style was identified with that of the urban @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black player from Baton Rouge who competed against Maravich in the summer , tells Kriegel , " There had never been a white guy who played like that  --  he had a soul game . " The growing National Basketball Association was beginning to be dominated by African-Americans , and the mantle of " great white hope " thrust upon Maravich , along with the accompanying rich contract , did n't help his transition to the league ; when he joined the Atlanta Hawks , black veterans like Lou Hudson and Joe Caldwell , who 'd toiled for years for a fraction of the money Maravich commanded , were understandably annoyed . In time , the tempest blew over , but over a 10-year career that saw enough success for him to be named one of the N.B.A. 's 50 greatest players , a complementarity of teammates and coach failed to materialize , and he never came close to showcasing his skills in the service of a championship . <p> Over the 800 pages in these books , despite tales of drinking , vegetarianism and interest in extraterrestrials , Pete Maravich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's because he was a mystery to himself , constantly searching before his post-career embrace of Christianity . His innate basketball talent was manifest so early in life  --  he once said , " There is n't anything I did at L.S.U. or in the N.B.A. I could n't do at 13 "  --  that the young man was the sum of his basketball feats , which he all but admitted late in life when he described that earlier self as " a basketball android . " <p> What may be a revelation here is the portrait that emerges of Press Maravich , who might stereotypically be viewed as merely riding his son 's remarkable skills to the L.S.U. head coaching job . Kriegel is particularly good at offering a corrective , and the most successful part of his book describes the elder Maravich 's hardscrabble upbringing in the Serbian immigrant enclave of Aliquippa , Pa. , a company town where nearly everyone worked for the steel producer Jones &; Laughlin . These vivid pages follow Press as he masters basketball in a church gym , stars in college and in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and works his way up the high school and college coaching ranks by forming teams of players as hard-nosed and hardheaded as he was . " Press did n't recruit ability , " Kriegel writes . " He recruited desire . He wanted guys who loved the game as much as he did , who shared his confusion of basketball with salvation . " <p> At basketball backwaters like Davis and Elkins College in West Virginia and the football powerhouse Clemson , his undersize teams became so well drilled in his theories of tenacious defense and meticulous execution that the legendary U.C.L.A. coach John Wooden often sought him out for advice . " They were an odd couple , " Kriegel writes , " Wooden measured and modest while Press was loud and profane . " In both books , Press emerges as a full , flawed but appealing man , driven and tender , boastful and loving . " Press was one of the greatest , most entertaining guys I 've ever met , " an L.S.U. administrator says in " Maravich . " But Press 's formidable basketball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had ... become obsessed with Pete 's numbers , " a former assistant coach says in " Pistol . " " He had gone from being one of the greatest coaches in the game to the coach of the greatest player in the game . " <p> In the end , reading about Maravich the son is like reading about Gale Sayers , the incomparable Chicago Bears running back : it mostly makes you want to watch those precious old films , to witness with your own eyes the impossible moves . That 's why the most exciting part of either of these books for me was in an appendix to " Maravich " under the " Selected References " section , titled " Video " : " Games : 1967 L.S.U. at Tennessee ; 1968 L.S.U. at Georgia , " and so on . Out there somewhere is Maravich in context. ##
