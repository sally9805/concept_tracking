It was J. Robert Oppenheimer himself who chose the code name " Trinity " for the 1945 test of the atom bomb he had done so much to create . He would say later that he was inspired by a line from the poet John Donne : " Batter my heart , three-personed God . " It was just like Oppenheimer , at a moment of triumph , to lay in a note of anguish . He may have been the physicist who led  --  who drove  --  the scientific crash program at Los Alamos , N.M . But he was not a simple man . It tells you something that his idea of the right parting gift for one girlfriend was Dostoyevsky 's The Possessed . <P> Nine years after Trinity , and then the incineration of Hiroshima and Nagasaki , Oppenheimer was stripped of his government security clearance after an inquiry into his past association with communists . As an effort to prove that he had been a party member , much less one involved in espionage , the inquest was a failure . Its real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prominent American critic of the U.S. move from atomic weapons to the much more lethal hydrogen bomb . <P> Two accounts of his complex life can be found in American Prometheus : The Triumph and Tragedy of J. Robert Oppenheimer ( Knopf ; 721 pages ) and 109 East Palace : The Secret City of Los Alamos ( Simon &; Schuster ; 424 pages ) . To grasp the full dimensions of Oppenheimer 's humiliation , you need to understand not only the currents of American postwar paranoia but also the tangled particulars of the man himself . Even a generous evaluation of his fate would call him complicit in his downfall . Whether through hubris or naivet , he refused to take seriously that his years of association with communists would open him to suspicion . American Prometheus tells his story at length and exceedingly well . The authors , Kai Bird and Martin J. Sherwin , employ a mix of thoroughness and judgment that makes this an essential book . <P> Oppenheimer was just 38 when he was chosen to direct what was called the Manhattan Project . Brilliant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had long been recognized as a star of the new quantum physics , a man with an acute and elegant mind . During his years as a physics professor at Berkeley and Caltech , he had also signed just about every petition for farmworkers ' rights and attended every fund raiser for the Spanish Republic . Oppenheimer always denied that he had ever been a member of the Communist Party . But he never sought to conceal that he had spent much of his professional life surrounded by party members , including his younger brother Frank . Even his wife had been a member before their marriage .
