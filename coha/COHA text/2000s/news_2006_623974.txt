<p> Get a bunch of skateboarders together and more than likely , talk will soon turn to the cops : Every skateboarder seems to have a police story . <p> " My nickname was ' lawyer , ' " says Ventura writer and skateboarder Chris Long , sitting at Cafe Abir in the Western Addition with local writer Travis Jensen and Seattle artist Dale Dreiling . " When I was 14 , a cop arrested me at a gas station for skateboarding and when I was in his car , I heard stuff about a heroin overdose come over the radio , and I was like , hey man , why do n't you go after that instead of wasting your time harassing me , and he was like , ' What , you 're lawyering me ? ' " Long says , grinning a little . <p> " Not all cops are like this , but you get these meathead cops who , really , do n't seem to have anything better to do , " Jensen adds . <p> Skateboarding and those who enforce the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Always . " <p> Skateboarding has exploded across the pop culture landscape over the past few years , moving from fringe pastime to certified sport , with a whole industry of shoes , decks , competitions , video games and , of course , stars behind it . <p> But still , many local skaters say that they spend way too much time fighting to do their sport . " The problem , " says skateboarder and artist Isaac McKay-Randozzi , " is that there 's all this energy directed toward the police , when that energy could be going toward creating and designing new places to skate . " <p> The struggle between authority and the skaters provides the impetus for a new anthology , " No Comply : Skateboarding Speaks on Authority " ( FunNotFame Productions ; 239 pages ; $20 ) , published and edited by Long and Jensen . <p> While much of the book vents frustrations about not only the police but other authority figures  --  parents , sensitive neighbors , vigilant citizens  --  who make it hard for skateboarders to roam unmolested , Long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment from the Man . " We did n't want to do this just to give the finger to cops , " Long says . " We want to reach out to skateboarders , especially kids , and give them a voice . " Long echoed the point in his introduction to the book , saying in effect : The real solution to the problems of authority lies in mutual respect . <p> San Francisco has had a long history of conflicts with skateboarders . In the mid- ' 90s , San Francisco was known as the " mecca " of street skateboarding , with an unfortunate focus on skateboarders appropriating stairs , handrails and curbs instead of building ramps . With seminal magazines Thrasher and Slap based in San Francisco , as well as skateboarding luminaries who could use the geography of the city , the hills and the angled concrete , it was ground zero for some of the most rebellious elements of the scene . <p> Long and Jensen , along with others interviewed at the crowded book release party at the Purple Skunk Skate Shop in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action peaked in the mid- ' 90s at popular spots like Pier 7 , Justin Herman Plaza and along the Embarcadero . " It was crazy . You 'd be sitting on a bench and police cars would be running in every direction , grabbing kids wherever they could , " recalls Kent Uyehara , owner of Haight Street 's FTC board shop and a member of the recently disbanded San Francisco Skateboard Task force , in a telephone interview . <p> Outside of city politics , Long names " lawyers and insurance agents " as primary opponents of skateboarding . Others echoed his thought , both in the anthology and in conversation . " It 's because it 's a property issue . It 's because , in this country , you can sue for damages for falling down on someone 's property , " says Isaac McKay-Randozzi , 29 , an artist and skateboarder . <p> The problem , many say , is that there are no legal places in San Francisco to skate . <p> " Specifically in California , public skateparks are a huge trend , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like , how can you have something be illegal when you do n't have a legal option . " <p> But that will soon change . As a result of the Newsom administration in City Hall , which Uyehara finds to be very supportive of skateboarders , there are plans afoot to open two skateparks in San Francisco in the next year . While highly debated , it seems that plans are moving forward for one in the Mission District 's Potrero del Sol Park , and one in the area under the Octavia ramp in Hayes Valley . <p> Nowadays , police pressure has abated thanks to another source of skater stress : skatestoppers on the streets . Uyehara says that along the Embarcadero , more than $100,000 was spent to make the " Mile of Lights " unfriendly to skaters  --  in the form of metal starfish . In other places , architectural choices , rounding off edges , for instance , have been used to deter skateboarders . <p> Implicit in the conversation about skateboarders and authority is the changing nature of the sport . As Jake Phelps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After 1995 , after the X-games got marketed everywhere , money made it a ' cool ' thing to do . It 's become homogenized . " <p> Skateboarding 's outlaw image in popular culture has been strengthened by the release of two films , " Dogtown and Z-Boys " and the fictionalized film version , " Lords of Dogtown , " which show how the first skater team was born . Tony Hawk is a household name ; skateboarding videos have launched the acting careers of Johnny Knoxville and his Jackass cohort , Bam Margera , rumored to be involved with pop star Jessica Simpson . <p> Skateboarding , too , has been a major force in the widespread popularity and commodification of urban street art . The Yerba Buena Center for the Arts hosted an exhibition titled " Beautiful Losers , " which featured a " free basin " for skateboarders to drop by and skate in last year . Some of the better known San Francisco artists , such as Tommy Guerrero , Chris Johanson and members of the Mission School , have been skateboarders ; graffiti artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less-than-legal ways . <p> But while it seems as if every local gallery has a few painted skateboarder decks for sale , skateboarder writing is less common . " Writing about skateboarders is very rarely done by skaters themselves , " Long notes . " If it 's from a major publishing house , it tends to be from someone who does n't actually skate . " <p> Before this month , Jensen and Long never had met face-to-face . They knew each other only through their work . Jensen , who writes under the name " SF Masher , " has published a book of fiction , and Long has written a book titled " Manifesto . " After Jensen read the review Long wrote of his book in the San Francisco skater magazine Slap , an e-mail correspondence was struck up in 2004 . They went back and forth for months until , in late August , they decided they should put something together around the idea of authority . They are particularly enamored of their book 's title , as it has a double meaning for those in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trick . <p> Thirteen weeks later , " No Comply " was done . <p> " It came together really , really fast , " Jensen says . " A lot of people really stepped up for us . " The editors asked about a hundred people they knew either personally or by reputation , and then put out a call for submissions on skateboarder Web sites . In the end , almost 60 people added words , illustrations or photographs to the project . It was printed at a printing house Long works for , and funded by the editors themselves under the name Fun Not Fame productions . It 'll be available at skate shops exclusively for the first three months , and then will get a wider distribution at book stores . <p> " No Comply " is the first volume in a planned " Skateboarding Speaks " series , which Long and Jensen plan on publishing at a rate of one per year . <p> But where would skateboarding be without rebellion ? " Nothing can stop us , ever , " affirms Thrasher magazine editor Jake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mystique . " <p> Phelps did n't mince words about the character of the sport  --  skateboarding , he said , is " inherently selfish " and he dismissed the idea of skateboarder culture . " Listen , " Phelps said , " skateboarding culture exists because it 's really difficult . What teaches is the concrete . That art stuff , it 's crap . " <p> Other skateboarders disagree , saying that as skateboarders have grown up , so have the attitudes . " You see older skaters doing other things , being artists or musicians or designers , contributing to society in so many ways , " says McKay-Randozzi . " Skateboarding breeds creativity . This book exists because there are so many goddamn talented people who skateboard .
