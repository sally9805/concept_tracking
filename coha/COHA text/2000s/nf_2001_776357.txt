Natives * * * 13,000 B.C.  --  A.D. 1492 // Scholars used to think of Native American cultures as relatively static , unchanging for centuries until encountered and overwhelmed by the European invaders after 1492 . Those scholars assumed that the descriptions of Indian cultures by early explorers could be read backward to imagine their predecessors from centuries past . With the help of recent archaeology and anthropology , we can now see that the explorers encountered a complex array of diverse peoples in the midst of profound change . Far from being an immutable people , the Indians had a complicated and dynamic history in America long before 1492. // Because so much remains controversial about native origins and so many new discoveries are daily made , all of the statements in this chapter are highly speculative and the dates are approximations . The archaeological evidence is fragmentary and limited , suggesting multiple possibilities . In general , I have favored the more cautious interpretations advanced by the debating archaeologists . And we should bear in mind that many contemporary native peoples entirely reject the scholarly explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they emerged in the Americas and so literally belong to this land . // Writing about pre-Columbian America is also fraught with controversy because we often enlist ancient natives in contemporary debates over our own social and environmental problems . To highlight the social inequities and environmental degradation of our own society , some romantics depict the pre-1492 Americans as ecological and social saints living in perfect harmony with one another and with their nature . To refute that critique , more conservative intellectuals eagerly point out every example of native violence , human sacrifice , and environmental waste . By generalizing from such examples , the conservatives revive the mythology of the European colonizers : that Indians were warlike savages with a primitive culture that deserved conquest and transformation . Often the debate deteriorates into a competition over who was innately worse : the Indian or the European . In fact , it would be difficult ( and pointless ) to make the case that either the Indians or the Europeans of the early modern era were by nature or culture more violent and " cruel " than the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were commonplace in both native America and early modern Europe . // Without pegging Europeans as innately more cruel and violent , we should recognize their superior power to inflict misery . By 1492 they had developed a greater technological and organizational capacity to conduct prolonged wars far from home . They also possessed imperial rivalries and religious ideologies that drove them outward across the world 's oceans in search of new lands and peoples to conquer . Superior means enabled , and ideological imperatives obliged , Europeans to cross the Atlantic and invade North America after 1492 . In the process , the newcomers escalated the bloodshed in the Americas to a level unprecedented in the native past . // And although Indians lacked the perfection of environmental saints , they did possess a culture that demanded less of their nature than did the Europeans of the early modern era . Almost all early explorers and colonizers marveled at the natural abundance they found in the Americas , a biodiversity at odds with the deforestation and extinctions that the Europeans had already wrought in most of their own continent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced more modest changes initiated by the native occupation . // MIGRATION // With the exception of frozen and isolated Antarctica , North and South America were the last continents occupied by people . All of the human fossils found in the Americas are almost certainly less than fifteen thousand years old and belong to the biologically modern form . Dental , genetic , and linguistic analysis reveals that most contemporary Native Americans are remarkably homogeneous and probably descend from a few hundred ancestors who came to North America within fifteen thousand years of the present ( with the exception of the later-arriving Athabascan , Inuit , and Aleut peoples ) . // Most scholars believe that the first Americans migrated from Siberia in northeast Asia . Genetic and skeletal ( especially dental ) evidence suggests special affinities between Native Americans and the peoples of Siberia . And the proximity of Siberia to Alaska offers the readiest passage between the Old and the New World , indeed the only practicable route for peoples without the marine technology to traverse the Atlantic or Pacific Ocean . // About fifteen thousand years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ranged far and wide in pursuit of the roaming and grazing herds of large and meaty ( but dangerous ) mammals , especially mammoths , musk oxen , and woolly rhinoceroses . It was a hard , cold , and generally short life in which hunger alternated with the episodic binges of a big kill . Because the people had to remain on the move ( on foot ) in pursuit of the herds , they could not develop permanent villages and did not accumulate heavy possessions . // In their pursuit of the herds , some hunting bands passed into what is now North America . Today the oceanic Bering Strait separates Siberia from Alaska . But between about twenty-five thousand and twelve thousand years ago , a colder global climate  --  an Ice Age  --  locked up more of the world 's water in polar icecaps , which spread southward as immense glaciers , covering the northern third of North America . The enlarged icecaps lowered the ocean levels by as much as 360 feet , creating a land bridge between Siberia and Alaska . // Of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they were discovering and colonizing a new continent , nor that they were crossing a land bridge that would subsequently vanish beneath the rising Pacific Ocean when the global climate warmed . The newcomers naturally regarded the flat , gently undulating , cold , and arid grassland as simply an extension of their home . // The period between fifteen thousand and twelve thousand years ago was an ideal time for a crossing into North America , because the global climate was slowly warming and the glaciers were in gradual retreat , sufficiently so to permit an easier passage into the continent but not yet so far as entirely to refill the Bering Strait with water . By about ten thousand years ago the glacial ice had retreated to approximately its present limits in the arctic , and the climate and sea levels stabilized close to their modern configurations . As the icecap receded over the centuries , the migrants found it easier to spread southward and eastward into North America and beyond . Remarkably similar archaeological sites of human encampments suddenly became common about twelve thousand to ten thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Florida . // As the land bridge submerged , migration from Siberia became more difficult  --  but not impossible for people possessing small boats made from animal skins stretched over a wooden framework . At its narrowest , the Bering Strait is only three miles wide . Contemporary Native Americans who speak an Athabascan language descend from a second pulse of emigrants , who arrived about ten thousand to eight thousand years ago . Settling first in the subarctic of Alaska and northwestern Canada , some Athabascan bands gradually worked their way down the Rocky Mountains , reaching the American southwest about six hundred years ago . These people later became known as the Navajo and Apache . // A third surge of colonization began about five thousand years ago and featured the ancestors of the Inuit ( or " Eskimos " ) and Aleut . Skilled boat builders , they specialized in the hunting of sea mammals  --  walruses , seals , and whales . The Aleut settled the Aleutian islands southwest of Alaska , while their Inuit cousins gradually expanded eastward along the Arctic coasts of northern Alaska @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred years ago . // PALEO AND ARCHAIC AMERICA // We do not know what the people in the first pulse of migration named themselves , but scholars call them the Paleo-Indians . As in their Siberian past , the Paleo-Indians lived by hunting and gathering in small bands of about fifteen to fifty individuals : the optimum size for far-ranging travel in pursuit of animals as well as for cooperation in the hunt and butchering . Their basic weapon and tool was a spear with a sharp , flaked-stone point ( usually flint ) bound tightly to a wooden shaft . Most of their archaeological sites were temporary encampments near perennial springs , waterholes , and river crossings  --  places where big game came to drink or to pass . After consuming a kill , they moved on in pursuit of another herd . // At first , the Paleo-Indians primarily found in North America a vast , cool grassland that sustained large herds of slow-moving herbivores initially inexperienced in defending themselves against a predator as cunning , numerous , and cooperative as humans . The beasts included immense mammoths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as caribou , moose , and deer . The Paleo-Indians found beavers as big as bears : seven feet long . The giant bison had horns spanning six feet , and the mammoths stood twelve feet high and could weigh ten tons , nearly as big as their modern relatives , the elephants . The Paleo-Indians truly experienced the discovery and occupation of a vast new domain of " free land " : free from other humans and abounding with plant and animal life . After centuries of subarctic hardship and recurrent hunger , the first Americans had found the hunters ' Eden . // But no Eden lasts for long . An abundant diet permitted an explosive population growth , which , in turn , pressed against local supplies of plants and animals . As bands grew too large for a locale to sustain , they subdivided , with new bands hiving off in pursuit of more distant animal herds . By about nine thousand years ago , people could be found from Alaska to the southern-most tip of South America , a distance of some eight thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spread of highly skilled hunters , almost all of the largest mammals rapidly died out in the Americas . The extinctions comprised two-thirds of all New World species that weighed more than one hundred pounds at maturity  --  including the giant beaver , giant ground sloth , mammoth , mastodon , and horses and camels . It is ironic that horses and camels first evolved in North America and migrated westward into Asia , where they were eventually domesticated , while those that remained in the Americas became extinct . The giant bison died out , leaving its smaller cousin , the buffalo , as the largest herbivore on the Great Plains . Of the old , shaggy great beasts , only the musk oxen survived and only in the more inaccessible reaches of the arctic . // At the same time that the largest mammals became extinct , the environment became more diverse . Over the generations , the global warming gradually shrank the grasslands and expanded the forests . The revival of complex forest environments expanded the range of plant and small animal species that could be gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mega-animals induced the nomadic bands to pursue more diversified strategies to tap a broader range of food sources . The natives had to learn their local environments more intimately to harvest shellfish , fish , birds , nuts , seeds , berries , and tubers . The Indians obtained more of their diet from fishing as they developed nets , traps , and bone hooks . Their hunting evolved into the patient and prolonged tracking of more elusive mammals , especially deer , pronghorn antelope , moose , elk , and caribou . Beginning about nine thousand years ago the Indians adjusted to their smaller , fleeter prey by developing the atlatl  --  a spear thrower that provided increased thrust , velocity , and distance . // American archaeologists distinguish the peoples leading this more complex and more locally framed way of life between about nine thousand and three thousand years ago as " Archaic " to distinguish them from their " Paleo-Indian " ancestors . As the Archaic Indians exploited a broader array of food sources , they more than compensated for the loss of the great mammals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resumed their population growth . The more local and eclectic Archaic way of life could sustain about ten times as many people on a given territory as could the Paleolithic predation on herds of great beasts . From a late Paleolithic level of about 100,000 people , North America 's population probably grew to one million by the end of the Archaic period . Obliged to change by the potentially disastrous demise of the megafauna , native peoples innovated to develop a more efficient and productive relationship with their diverse environments . // In the temperate climes , people began to live for longer periods in semi-permanent villages located beside rivers and lakes or along seacoasts , at places where fish and birds and shellfish and wild food plants were most abundant . They also settled in larger groups within smaller territories . Each band developed a seasonal round of activity and movement within a more defined territory , harvesting those plants and animals as they became abundant at different seasons . For example , in the southwest during the summer and fall the people dispersed to hunt rabbits , deer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onset of winter with its cold rains led them to gather in larger groups in caves and rock shelters in the sides of canyons , where they harvested prickly pear and pi ? on nuts . In the spring , they scattered again in pursuit of roots and berries and game . // Archaic Indians also began to modify the environment to increase the yields of plants and animals that sustained them . In particular , they set annual fires to reduce small trees and encourage edge environments that , by providing more browse and better grazing , promoted a larger deer herd for the people to hunt . In some places the Indians weeded out inedible plants to encourage clusters of edible plants such as wild onions , sunflowers , and marsh elder . These practices brought a people to the verge of horticulture. // Gender structured work roles : men were responsible for fishing and hunting while women harvested and prepared wild plants . In general , men 's activities entailed wide-ranging travel and the endurance of greater exposure and danger , while women 's activities kept them close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can intuit this from burials , for the dead were interred with the tools they needed in the afterlife : men with hunting , fishing , woodworking , and leatherworking tools ; women with tools to dig and grind nuts and roots . Women probably gained in status as their gathering activities became more critical to their band 's survival . // The Archaic way of life was a decentralizing phenomenon as many far-flung peoples figured out how best to exploit the mix of resources peculiar to their locale . The immense continent of North America offered extraordinary climatic and environmental diversity . Peoples living along the Atlantic or Pacific coasts , on the Great Plains , in the Rocky Mountains , in the interior deserts , on the edges of the Canadian arctic , or in temperate forests had to pursue different strategies for survival , had to adapt to different seasonal cycles affecting distinctive sets of plants and animals . // As the Archaic Indian bands proliferated and specialized in harvesting the particular local resources , they became distinguished culturally , developing different languages , rituals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The native peoples of North America spoke at least 375 distinct languages by 1492 . The process of cultural differentiation proceeded most elaborately and rapidly in the Pacific northwest and northern California , where the general abundance and the subdivision into many localized micro-environments led to the development of some five hundred culturally diverse communities speaking nearly fifty distinct languages . // Cultural differentiation did not mean cultural isolation . Trade networks developed over very long distances . Archaeologists have found that some relatively small and highly valued objects could pass hundreds and even thousands of miles through multiple bands . At Archaic sites in the midwest or Great Basin , archaeologists find marine shells from the Atlantic and Pacific coasts ; on the coasts they uncover copper from the Great Lakes and obsidian from the Rocky Mountains . Ideas and innovations traveled along with these objects so that the trading peoples influenced one another over long distances . // HORTICULTURE // Through trial and error , over many generations , horticulture evolved from the practices of gathering wild plants , rather than by sudden and conscious invention . As some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wild plants with edible seeds , they also gradually developed hybrids of increasing reliability and productivity . For example , wild maize has a single inch-long ear with fifty tiny kernels . By 1500 B.C. , Indians in central Mexico had learned how to cross maize  --  " Indian corn "  --  with other wild grasses to create hybrids with multiple ears , protective husks , and cobs with multiple rows of kernels. // The Indians of central Mexico pioneered the three great crops of North American horticulture : maize , squashes , and beans . As these domesticate plants became more important in their diet , the peoples of central Mexico devoted less time to hunting , gathering , and fishing . Indeed , the expansion of cleared fields and the growth of the human population reduced the habitat for wildlife . By expanding the food supply , horticulture permitted a renewed surge in the human population and a more sedentary life in larger and more permanent villages . Indeed , maize requires permanence , for unless carefully tended , guarded , and watered through its growing season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drought . As people became dependent on corn , they had to live most of the year in villages near their cultivated fields . The new horticulture also promoted economic differentiation and social stratification as the food surplus enabled some people to specialize as craftsmen , merchants , priests , and rulers . // But the new dependence on horticulture also had negative consequences . The crops were vulnerable to catastrophic collapse from a prolonged drought or infestations of insects and blights . Horticulture also demanded more sustained and repetitive work than did the hunting-and-gathering life , in which temporary bursts of exertion alternated with longer stretches of rest . And a horticultural diet that relies too heavily on one plant , particularly maize , is not as healthy as the diverse diet of hunter-gatherers . The skeletons of early farmers reveal a want of sufficient salt or protein , episodes of early childhood malnutrition , and an overall loss of stature . Moreover , the denser populations of horticultural villages facilitated the spread of communicable diseases , principally tuberculosis , which was less common among dispersed hunter-gatherers . // Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By about 1500 B.C. , peoples in the American southwest and midwest had begun to cultivate some maize and squash , but only as a minor supplement to their hunting and gathering . Not until about 500 B.C. did native peoples north of the Rio Grande develop strains of maize better suited to their cooler climate and shorter growing season . Thereafter , cultivation spread more rapidly . Between about A.D. 700 and 1200 , maize , beans , and squash became fundamental to the native diet in the American southwest , midwest , and southeast and the more temperate portions of the northeast . // In Mexico and the American southwest , where maize cultivation was most advanced , Indian men reduced their hunting and became the primary cultivators . In those relatively arid regions , maize fields required the laborious construction and maintenance of extensive irrigation ponds , dams , and ditches . In the more humid stretches of central and eastern North America , maize cultivation arrived relatively late and required less labor . Consequently , there the native peoples regarded horticulture as an extension of gathering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remained preoccupied with hunting and fishing . // Horticulture never spread universally among the Indians . Some lived where the growing season was too short : in the vast arctic and subarctic regions of Alaska and Canada or in the high elevations of the Rockies and Sierra Nevada . Or they dwelled where there was too little water : in the western Great Plains and in most of the Great Basin between the Rockies and Sierra Nevada . Where either the growing season was too short or water too scant , the inhabitants continued to live in small , mobile , highly dispersed , and relatively egalitarian groups . Rather than horticulture , the most significant development for these people was their adoption of the bow and arrow after about A.D. 500. // Natives also did not develop horticulture in the temperate and humid coastal zone of California and the Pacific northwest , despite its sufficient growing seasons and abundant water . Along the Pacific coast , the **25;389;TOOLONG complex was so productive that the native peoples did not feel the pressures that elsewhere led to horticulture . In California an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially large population . Similarly , in the mild and rainy Pacific northwest , the people lived plentifully on fish ( especially salmon ) and sea mammals . Endowed with a bountiful diet and leisure time , the Indians of the northwestern raincoast could develop and sustain elaborate rituals , art , and status hierarchies without developing horticulture. // HOHOKAM AND ANASAZI // Between about A.D. 300 and 1100 two especially complex and populous cultures emerged in the American southwest : the Hohokam and the Anasazi . The names are scholarly conventions , for we do not know what those peoples called themselves . " Hohokam " and " Anasazi " signify broad cultural similarities rather than linguistic and political unity . Neither constituted a nation-state , to say nothing of an empire . Instead , both cultures consisted of several linguistic groups and many politically independent villages or towns ( later called pueblos by the Spanish ) . Neither the Anasazi nor the Hohokam had beasts of burden ( other than dogs ) , developed a system of writing , or employed the wheel . Nonetheless , both built substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by men who combined the roles of chief and priest . // The Anasazi and Hohokam annually conducted public rituals meant to sustain the harmony and productivity of their world . Far from taking harmony and abundance for granted , they regarded constant ritual exertion as essential to prevent nature 's collapse into chaos . Their arid land of limited resources and competing villages afforded good cause for their existential anxiety . // Both the Anasazi and the Hohokam manifested , to varying degrees , the influence of central Mexico , the preeminent cultural hearth of the continent . In trade with central Mexico , they exchanged turquoise stones for parrots , copper bells , and maize seed . In addition to transmitting their food crops , Mesoamericans taught the Hohokam and Anasazi how to cultivate cotton and to weave cloth . The largest Hohokam villages constructed ball courts and platform temple mounds resembling those of central Mexican cities . // ( Continues ... ) //
