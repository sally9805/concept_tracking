Both " ecstasy " and " Sammy the Bull " Gravano came to Phoenix the same way : by stealth . But when they met , in the darker corners of this sprawling , newly built city , the result was explosive . Gravano arrived under the pseudonym Jimmy Moran , placed in secrecy by the federal witness-protection program . The former underboss of New York City 's Gambino crime family and a hit man responsible for 19 murders , Gravano became the government 's most important witness against the Mob . His testimony put 37 top-level mobsters behind bars and earned him a $1 million price on his head . Flush with money from book and TV deals , he was starting a new life as a businessman far from his old Brooklyn haunts . He bought an eight-bedroom , 4,399-sq. - ft. home with stables , a three-car garage and a pool complete with waterfall , plus a separate apartment . He set up legitimate businesses : an Italian restaurant and a small pool-construction company with brand-new trucks and heavy equipment . <P> Ecstasy came to Phoenix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by friends to share at secretive , insular clubs around the city . It was nothing big , just something that like-minded friends would pass among themselves while dancing away weekends . " We did n't even know it was here , " said a Phoenix narcotics cop . " It is not a 911 drug . Parents would drop their kids off at clubs thinking everything was O.K. because they did n't serve alcohol . " <P> But the secrets could not be contained . About two years ago , the rave scene in Phoenix began to grow . " It used to be everyone that showed up dressed alike and thought alike . Everyone knew each other . It was sort of a New Age hippie thing . Very cool , very mellow . No problems , " says an already nostalgic twentysomething local . " Then it just started to grow . People from the university would show up . Jocks would be there . It was , like , everybody was doing it . " As word of the raves spread , police began to hear that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year Gravano 's life in the slow lane sputtered . His identity , never a big secret , was disclosed by a local paper . The construction business , according to police , was far less successful than Gravano had hoped . But as Gravano whiled away the hours in the small brown office of Marathon Development  --  the same name he once used for a front company in New York  --  a new opportunity presented itself . Among the employees he had hired was an old acquaintance from New York , Michael Papa , a close friend of Gravano 's son Gerard . By this time , Gravano was no longer trying to conceal who he was . In fact , he reveled in the notoriety . In cafes and restaurants , he would talk to whoever would listen about the Mafia and the murders , gaining him a small but loyal following of young , rapt local kids to whom he offered advice and sometimes friendship . <P> Of all the acolytes , Papa , 23 , was the most like Sammy the Bull . Like Gravano , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Arizona toughs . According to police , Papa was one of the founding members of a group that went by various names  --  Hitler 's Youth , White Power or Devil Dogs  --  purportedly a racist high school gang that terrorized the Phoenix suburb of Gilbert . In truth , police sources say , the gang was really a steroid-laced football team that went bad from lack of direction . " They were bad , but they were n't racist . Hell , there were even black members , " says a police source .
