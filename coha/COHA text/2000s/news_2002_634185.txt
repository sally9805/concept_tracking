<p> Could it be a super-duper special morel spot ? A little hiding spot along an interstate sprouting the elusive mushroom ? <p> No , it 's just a busy time of the year for The Mushroom Man . From a rest area somewhere in the upper Midwest on his way to Fort Wayne , Ind. , on Wednesday , Larry Lonik called . <p> I want spring to hurry up and get here . And morels are a sure sign of spring . Even talking about them puts me in a spring frame of mind . The Mushroom Man never gets spored talking about his obsession . <p> My quests for morels over the years have been more rambling in the underbrush than finding of morels . The Mushroom Man could help . <p> The biggest mistake beginners make is two things , " Lonik said . First , they do n't go out early enough . The first week of 60 degrees where it does n't freeze at night , there is going to be a week like that soon . Right after that week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until you get a week of 80s . You want summer to delay arriving . <p> Second , beginners tend to look around their feet . You want to look 15-20 feet in front and look for the Christmas tree shape . Then go investigate any Christmas tree shapes . If you do that , you will cover more ground . " <p> Guilty on both counts . I always start looking too late , usually about the time you can waltz through the woods in sandals and cutoff jeans . And I am always looking at my feet like somebody who has dropped a dime in the grass . <p> I called Lonik because he runs Morel Heaven Weekends in April at Harpole 's Heartland Lodge in Pike County , just across the Mississippi River from Hannibal , Mo . It sounded like one of those weekends that could make major brownie points with my wife . <p> For $239 a person , you get a weekend of gourmet meals , seminars and cooking classes by Lonik , and morel hunting on 6,000 acres of private land . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is without a doubt , the best spot in the world , " said Lonik , who has sought morels all over the country . There is a variety of terrain at Harpole 's , flats , bluffs and valleys . There 's all these morels : black , white , giant , half-caps . That is the fun of mushroom hunting , learning to adjust . " <p> Lonik is beginning his 46th year of morel hunting . He was 6 the first time his dad , Tony , took him out in quest of morels . A few years back , some promoters in Kansas City , Mo. , hung The Mushroom Man handle on Lonik . <p> As he has grown in his morel hunting , Lonik delves more into the ethics of morel picking with an eye toward the conservation of the tasty , earthly morsel . <p> People have been using the wrong kind of bag , " Lonik said . You need to use a mesh bag . There 's half a million spores in every single mushroom . We were using bread bags and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We can actually increase the number of mushrooms if we use mesh bags . " <p> With a mesh bag , a trail of spore is spread around as the picker walks from his secret spot back to the car . That 's where the next generation of morels will come from . <p> For all kinds of morel stuff from special mesh bags to videos to signing up for Morel Heaven Weekends , go to www.morelheaven.com or call ( 877 ) 667-3518 . <p> Dale Bowman may be contacted at outdoordb@aol.com . <p> SO COOL : Exelon Nuclear announced Thursday that its LaSalle and Clinton cooling lakes would reopen to public fishing Friday .

Braidwood , Clinton and LaSalle , which are owned by Exelon but operated by the Illinois Department of Natural Resources , were closed after Sept. 11 . Heidecke closed Sept. 11 , then reopened before closing again when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LaSalle until 8 a.m . Friday , but action started quickly . <p> By 8 a.m. , they had already caught two 5-pound stripers from shore , " site superintendent Ted Love said . <p> There is no concessionaire at LaSalle , so have all bait , gas and food before arriving . Be prepared because weather can shut down boat access at LaSalle quickly . During March , LaSalle is open from 6 a.m. to dusk Wednesday through Sunday . Love hopes to go to seven days in April . <p> DEER TESTING STARTS : Landowners within a 415-square-mile area of Vermont in southern Wisconsin began shooting deer for testing Thursday .

Call ( 312 ) 225-8538 . <p> DALE 'S MAILBAG <p> Q : Some time ago , I read in your column about opening a ramp for west suburban people to get into Lake Michigan . Has anything been done about this ? Has anyone looked at the ramp at Summit ? A boat club used to have it . Summit closed them down and opened it themselves , but it closed when they could n't afford the insurance . The boat club took over again and would let you launch for a fee of $15 , but only on Friday night , Saturday and Sunday . When I went by the boat club last fall , it was closed again . <p> E-mail from Tom Toler <p> A : The question has bothered many of us for a long time . Summit no longer has anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Metropolitan Water Reclamation District . And at this point , public access is still in limbo , " according to public information coordinator Peggy Bradley . The general superintendent Jack Farnan has not recommended any action yet to the board of commissioners , " she said . Last fall , I took a long ride with Farnan and others on a Friends of the Chicago River outing . At that time , he said they would be working to open the launch . The hangups , as might be expected , are the insurance and liability issues . Chicago is no closer to opening a launch on the Chicago River or the Sanitary and Ship Canal . Frankly , I am not sure how sincere city officials are in their efforts to open a launch . The MWRD might be our best chance . Currently , public access to the Chicago River by motorboat can be achieved by launching at Alsip on the Cal Sag and coming around the horn and up the Sanitary and Ship Canal or by launching at Burnham or Diversey harbors , then coming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Masters Walleye Circuit tournament , Spring Valley : Sauger fishing on the Illinois River gets its unofficial spring start this week with the 15th annual MWC tournament at Barto Landing in Spring Valley on Saturday and next Sunday . It 's both a celebration of the rebounding sauger population on the Illinois and a chance to learn new techniques . Trolling with leadcore line was introduced during this tournament . The Detroit tactic of hand-lining also was introduced in recent years . But most local competitors will stick with what we all do on the Illinois : either vertical jigging or pulling three-ways . <p> STAT PACK <p> 110 <p> Number of morel mushrooms picked by Gale Cole , grand champion of the Illinois State Morel Mushroom Hunting Championship in May . <p> 9 1/2 , 11 <p> Inches tall/inches in circumference of the largest mushroom at the Illinois State Morel Mushroom Hunting Championship in May .
