<p> When Bill and Cathy Johnson threw a going-away party for their college-bound daughter this summer , it felt more like a wake than a celebration . <p> " It hit me in a very unusual and unexpected way , " says Cathy , 54 , of Sandy Springs . " I thought it would be happy , but my emotions were raw . It 's a very emotional time because you realize there 's no going back from here . And I 'm going to miss her terribly . " <p> The Johnsons ' youngest child , Addie , 18 , is flying the coop , leaving her anxious parents home alone in an eerily quiet empty nest . She 's enrolled at the University of Colorado , 1,228 miles away . <p> The Johnsons are n't alone . This season , as children leave home for college , thousands of Atlantans and millions of Americans are struggling to adapt to newly empty nests . <p> For some the transition is easy ; for many others it 's a time of sudden crying jags , lumps in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confusion , quavering voices and anxiety so extreme that the mere sight of a single smelly basketball shoe in a cleaned-out empty closet can set off a really stinky marital squabble , even among happy couples . <p> Longtime family counselors Claudia and David Arp , authors of " Fighting for Your Empty Nest Marriage " ( Jossey-Bass , $24.99 ) , say divorce rates spike about 15 percent when couples reach the empty nest years . It 's the second most perilous period for marriages , following only the notorious seven-year-itch period following nuptials . <p> " It 's a time when everything changes , " she says . " You lose your identity . A lot of empty nesters start losing their emotional connectedness . You 've been so busy with your kids that , all of a sudden , you have time to talk but not much to say . It 's very scary . " <p> Adds Johnne Armentrout , a family counselor and professor at Wake Forest University : " You suddenly realize your influence on your children is greatly diminished when they leave home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should ? Have I been the kind of parent I wanted to be ? Are they going to be safe , happy , successful ? ' <p> " It 's harder on the boomer generation because we 've had the luxury of becoming more involved . Now we know we 're losing control , and that 's frightening . And for people in shaky marriages , there 's nothing left to hold them together . " <p> But most will survive and even thrive more than ever before , says psychologist Howard Markman , an expert on marriage at the University of Denver . " According to studies , this is the happiest stage of many couples ' lives if they are able to get through it . " <p> For many couples , the immediate task is to get over the angst , fears and tears they 're experiencing . <p> " We have a wonderful marriage , and my husband and I are best friends , but we 're still taking this very rough , " says Page Morgan , a 44-year-old east Cobb real estate agent whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the University of Mississippi . <p> " We 're contemplating how on earth we will continue without children . It is a major change in our life . I 've had some weepy times since graduation in May . We 're a close family , and it 's like we 're breaking up and nobody 's mad at one another . " <p> Adds husband Ed : " You 're having a chunk taken out of your heart that is irreplaceable . The wound heals , but you still have a void , and it 'll heal up . But for now , the wound is there . " <p> Wounds were obvious last weekend at the University of Georgia , when thousands of freshmen checked into their dorms . Some parents dabbed at their eyes . Hugs held until embarrassed teens could pry themselves away . <p> " You can leave now , Mom , " said Jeremy Brook , 18 , as his mother Sue , her voice quivering , kept herself too busy to cry . <p> " Just a little bit longer , Jere , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to get your room straight . " <p> " Let 's go , Sue , " said his grim-faced dad , Maury , of east Cobb . " It 's time . " <p> Parents whose kids have n't left yet , like Jay and Barbara Halpern of Sandy Springs , say they 've been feeling the time running out for weeks . <p> " You realize part of your life is over with , " said Barbara , whose daughter Katie , is headed next week to Indiana University . " I 'm very sad . You know you 've done everything you can and now they are on their own . It 'll never be the same . That part of your life is over . " <p> Finality  --  the end of an era and a stage in life  --  seems to be a universal theme . <p> Emma Gilbert , 50ish , of east Cobb , is sending her son Charles to Howard University in Washington but claims " my mind is content . " Then she adds : " This is almost like losing your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll be hard to get used to not hearing the stereo or TV or the tapping of his fingers on the computer at 1 a.m . I do n't think the sting will ever go away . " <p> Not all parents are as willing to reveal their pain , and some insist they 're looking forward to being able to live a life devoid of youth activities and harping on whether homework 's done . <p> " I feel I have prepared for this , " says Debbie Levin , 47 , of Sandy Springs , whose daughter Wendy is now a freshman at the University of Wisconsin . " I do n't have to stay up till 1 a.m. anymore . I 'll finally get to spend some time with my husband . " <p> Then , almost as an afterthought , she admits there is a down side . <p> " But I am scared to death . They 'll have total freedom . Stay up all night . Those are the things that make me want to cry . " <p> Experts like Markman say this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their kids are finally spreading their wings , but sad to see them go and worried about how well they 'll fare . <p> Ed Morgan , father of Ole Miss-bound Andrew , says he 's " anxious to see the product of our handiwork , how we 've done . " <p> Such major transitions occur in every country , but seem to cause more parental trauma in America , says anthropologist Michael Dean Murphy of the University of Alabama , an expert on primitive and modern societies . <p> " American culture puts an extraordinary heavy load on the nuclear family , " he says . " I know a lot of people whose social world revolves around spouse and kids and maybe a few friends from work . Take a couple of kids out of that mix and you have deducted a big chunk of someone 's socialability . People in other societies do n't put so many emotional eggs in one basket . <p> " But , " he adds , " to miss your kids is an index of how much you like interacting with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Dr. Betty Polston , a California-based clinical psychologist and co-author of " Loving Midlife Marriage : A Guide to Keeping Romance Alive from the Empty Nest Through Retirement " ( John Wiley , $14.95 ) , has lived through the empty nest period and insists the best times come after the kids leave . <p> " Right now , people feel like their soul is missing , " she says . " You 're in an ending at first , a nowhere zone , where you 're just floating around , wondering what 's next . But then there 's a new beginning .
