Symmetry // An inkblot on a piece of paper is not particularly attractive to the eye , but if you fold the paper before the ink dries , you may get something that looks like figure 1 that is much more intriguing . In fact , the interpretation of similar inkblots forms the basis for the famous Rorschach test developed in the 1920s by the Swiss psychiatrist Hermann Rorschach . The declared purpose of the test is to somehow elicit the hidden fears , wild fantasies , and deeper thoughts of the viewers interpreting the ambiguous shapes . The actual value of the test as an " x-ray of the mind " is vehemently debated in psychological circles . As Emory University psychologist Scott Lilienfeld once put it , " Whose mind , that of the client or the examiner ? " Nevertheless , there is no denial of the fact that images such as that in figure 1 convey some sort of attractive and fascinating impression . Why ? // Is it because the human body , most animals , and so many human artifacts possess a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ features and creations of the human imagination exhibit such a symmetry in the first place ? // Most people perceive harmonious compositions such as Botticelli 's Birth of Venus as symmetrical . Art historian Ernst H. Gombrich even notes that the " liberties which Botticelli took with nature in order to achieve a graceful outline add to the beauty and harmony of the design . " Yet mathematicians will tell you that the arrangements of colors and forms in that painting are not symmetric at all in the mathematical sense . Conversely , most nonmathematical viewers do not perceive the pattern in figure 3 as symmetrical , even though it actually is symmetrical according to the formal mathematical definition . So what is symmetry really ? What role , if any , does it play in perception ? How is it related to our aesthetic sensibility ? In the scientific realm , why has symmetry become such a pivotal concept in our ideas about the cosmos around us and in the fundamental theories attempting to explain it ? Since symmetry spans such a wide range of disciplines , what " language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ describe and characterize symmetries and their attributes , and how was that universal language invented ? On a lighter note , can symmetry provide an answer to the all-important question posed in the title of one of the songs of rock star Rod Stewart  --  " Do Ya Think I 'm Sexy ? " // I will try to provide at least partial answers to all of these questions and many more . Along the way , I hope that the story as a whole will depict both the humanistic side of mathematics and , even more importantly , the human side of mathematicians . As we shall see , symmetry is the paramount tool for bridging the gap between science and art , between psychology and mathematics . It permeates objects and concepts ranging from Persian carpets to the molecules of life , from the Sistine Chapel to the sought-after " Theory of Everything . " Yet group theory , the mathematical language that describes the essence of symmetries and explores their properties , did not emerge from the study of symmetries at all . Rather , this astonishingly unifying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an equation that could n't be solved . The dramatic and tortuous history of this equation is an essential part of this intellectual saga . At the same time , this tale will shed light on the loneliness of genius and on the tenacity of the human intellect in the face of seemingly insurmountable challenges . I have put a tremendous effort into trying to solve the two-centuries-old mystery of the death of the protagonist of this story  --  the brilliant mathematician ? variste Galois . I believe that I have come closer to the truth than was ever possible before . // The witty playwright George Bernard Shaw once said , " The reasonable man adapts himself to the world ; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself . Therefore all progress depends on the unreasonable man . " In this book we shall encounter many unreasonable men and women . The creative process , by its very nature , seeks uncharted intellectual and emotional terrain . Brief forays into mathematical abstraction will offer a peek into the very nature of creativity . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Immunity to Changes // The word symmetry has ancient roots , coming from the Greek sym and metria , which translate into " the same measure . " When the Greeks labeled a work of art or an architectural design symmetric , they meant that one could identify some small piece of the work , such that the dimensions of all the other parts contained that piece a precise number of times ( the parts were " commensurable " ) . This early definition corresponds more to our modern notion of proportion than to symmetry . Nevertheless , the great philosophers Plato ( 428/427-348/347 BC ) and Aristotle ( 384-322 BC ) were quick to associate symmetry with beauty . In Aristotle 's words , " The chief forms of beauty are orderly arrangement in Greek taxis , proportion symmetria , and definiteness horismenon , which are revealed in particular by mathematics . " Following in the Greeks ' footsteps , the identification of symmetry with " due proportion " was subsequently propagated by the influential Roman architect Vitruvius ( ca. 70-25 BC ) , and it persisted all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Decem ( Ten Books on Architecture ) , literally the architectural bible in Europe for centuries , Vitruvius writes : // The design of a temple depends on symmetry , the principles of which must be carefully observed by the architect . They are due to proportion . Proportion is a correspondence among the measures of the members of an entire work , and of the whole to a certain part selected as standard . From this result the principles of symmetry . // The modern meaning of symmetry ( first introduced in the late eighteenth century ) in the precise mathematical sense is really " immunity to a possible change . " Or , as mathematician Hermann Weyl ( 1885-1955 ) once put it , " A thing is symmetrical if there is something you can do to it so that after you have finished doing it it looks the same as before . " Examine for example the verses // Is it odd how asymmetrical // Is " symmetry " ? // " Symmetry " is asymmetrical. // How odd it is. // This stanza remains unchanged if read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is symmetrical with respect to backward reading . If you envision the words as being arranged like beads along a string , you could regard this reverse reading as a sort of ( not literal ) mirror reflection of the stanza . This stanza does not change when mirror-reflected in the above sense  --  it is symmetrical with respect to such mirror reflection . Alternatively , if you prefer to think in terms of reading the poem out loud , then the backward reading corresponds to a time reversal , somewhat like rewinding a videotape ( again , not literally , because the individual sounds are not reversed ) . Phrases with this property are called palindromes. // The invention of palindromes is generally attributed to Sotades the Obscene of Maronea , who lived in the third century BC in Greek-dominated Egypt . Palindromes have been extremely popular with many word-play wizards such as the Englishman J. A. Lindon , and with the superb recreational-mathematics author Martin Gardner . One of Lindon 's amusing word-unit palindromes reads : " Girl , bathing on Bikini , eyeing boy , finds boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symmetric with respect to back-to-front reading letter by letter  --  " Able was I ere I saw Elba " ( attributed jokingly to Napoleon ) , or the title of a famous NOVA program : " A Man , a Plan , a Canal , Panama . " // Surprisingly , palindromes appear not just in witty word games but also in the structure of the male-defining Y chromosome . The Y 's full genome sequencing was completed only in 2003 . This was the crowning achievement of a heroic effort , and it revealed that the powers of preservation of this sex chromosome have been grossly underestimated . Other human chromosome pairs fight damaging mutations by swapping genes . Because the Y lacks a partner , genome biologists had previously estimated that its genetic cargo was about to dwindle away in perhaps as little as five million years . To their amazement , however , the researchers on the sequencing team discovered that the chromosome fights withering with palindromes . About six million of its fifty million DNA letters form palindromic sequences  --  sequences that read the same forward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These copies not only provide backups in case of bad mutations , but also allow the chromosome , to some extent , to have sex with itself  --  arms can swap position and genes are shuffled . As team leader David Page of MIT has put it , " The Y chromosome is a hall of mirrors . " // Of course , the most familiar example of mirror-reflection symmetry is that of the bilateral symmetry that characterizes the animal kingdom . From butterflies to whales , and from birds to humans , if you reflect the left half in a mirror you obtain something that is almost identical to the right half . I will , for the moment , ignore the small if tantalizing external differences that do exist , and also the fact that neither the internal anatomy nor the functions of the brain possess bilateral symmetry . // To many , the word symmetry is actually assumed to mean bilateral symmetry . Even in Webster 's Third New International Dictionary , one of the definitions reads : " Correspondence in size , shape , and relative position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line or median plane . " The precise mathematical description of reflection symmetry uses the same concepts . Take a drawing of a bilaterally symmetric butterfly and mark a straight line down the middle of the figure . If you flip the drawing over keeping the central line in place , perfect overlapping will occur . The butterfly remains unchanged  --  invariant  --  under reflection about its central line . // Bilateral symmetry is so prevalent in animals that it can hardly be due to chance . In fact , if you think of animals as vast collections of trillions and trillions of molecules , there are infinitely more ways to construct asymmetrical configurations out of these building blocks than symmetrical ones . The pieces of a broken vase can lie in a pile in many different assortments , but there is only one arrangement in which they all fit together to reproduce the intact ( and usually bilaterally symmetric ) vase . Yet the fossil record from the Ediacara Hills of Australia shows that soft-bodied organisms ( Spriggina ) that date back to the Vendian period ( 650 to 543 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since life forms on Earth were shaped by eons of evolution and natural selection , these processes must have somehow preferred bilateral or mirror symmetry . Of all the different guises animals could have taken , bilaterally symmetrical ones had superiority . There is no escape from the conclusion that this symmetry was a likely outcome of biological growth . Can we understand the cause for this particular predilection ? We can at least try to find some of its engineering roots in the laws of mechanics . One key point here is the fact that all directions on the surface of the Earth were not created equal . A clear distinction between up and down ( dorsal and ventral in animals , in the biological jargon ) is introduced by the Earth 's gravity . In most cases what goes up must come down , but not the other way around . Another distinction , between front and back , is a result of animal locomotion. // Any animal moving relatively rapidly , be it in the sea , on land , or in the air , has a clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Having all the sensory organs , the major detectors of light , sound , smell , and taste , in the front clearly helps the animal in deciding where to go and how to best get there . A frontal " radar " also provides an early warning against potential dangers . Having the mouth in the front can make all the difference between reaching lunch first or not . At the same time , the actual mechanics of movement ( especially on land and in the air ) under the influence of the Earth 's gravitational force have generated a clear difference between bottom and top . Once life emerged from the sea and onto the land , some sort of mechanical devices  --  legs  --  had to develop to carry the animal around . No such appendages were needed at the top , so the difference between top and bottom became even more pronounced . The aerodynamics of flying ( still under Earth 's gravity ) coupled with the requirements for a landing gear plus some means of movement on the ground combined to introduce top-bottom differences in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realization : There is nothing major in the sea , on the ground , or in the air , to distinguish between left and right . The hawk looking to the right sees just about the same environment it sees to the left . The same is not true about up and down  --  up is where the hawk flies even higher into the sky , while down is where it lands and builds its nest . Political puns aside , there really is no big difference between left and right on Earth , because there are no strong horizontal forces . To be sure , the Earth 's rotation around its axis and the Earth 's magnetic field ( the fact that Earth acts on its surroundings like a bar magnet ) do introduce an asymmetry . However , these effects are not nearly as significant at the macroscopic level as those of gravity and rapid animal motion . // The description so far explains why bilateral symmetry of living organisms makes sense mechanically . Bilateral symmetry is also economical  --  you get two organs for the price of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biology ( the genes ) or even more fundamentally from the laws of physics is a more difficult question , to parts of which I shall return in chapters 7 and 8 . Here let me note that many multicellular animals have an early embryonic body that lacks bilateral symmetry . The driving force behind the modification of the " original plan " as the embryo grows may indeed be mobility . // Not all animate nature lives in the fast lane . Life forms that are anchored in one place and are unable to move voluntarily , such as plants and sessile animals , do have very different tops and bottoms , but no distinguishable front and back or left and right . They have symmetry similar to that of a cone  --  they produce symmetrical reflections in any mirror passing through their central , vertical axis . Some animals that move very slowly , such as jellyfish , have a similar symmetry . // Obviously , once bilateral symmetry had developed in living creatures , there was every reason to keep it intact . Any loss of an ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a predator sneaking up on it unnoticed . // One may always wonder whether the particular standard configuration nature has endowed humans with is the optimal one . The Roman god Janus , for example , was the god of the gates and of new beginnings , including the first month ( January ) of the year . Accordingly , he is always depicted in art with two faces , one in the front facing forward ( symbolically toward the coming year ) and one at the back of the head ( toward the year that has passed ) . Such an arrangement in humans , while useful for some purposes , would have left no space for the parts of the brain that are responsible for the nonsensory systems . In his wonderful book The New Ambidextrous Universe , Martin Gardner tells the story of a Chicago entertainer who had a routine discussing the advantages of having various sensory organs at unusual spots on the body . Ears under the armpits , for instance , would be kept warm in the cold Chicago winters . Clearly , other shortcomings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of armpit ears would be seriously impaired unless you kept your arms raised all the time . // Science-fiction movies invariably feature aliens that are bilaterally symmetric . If extraterrestrial intelligent creatures that have evolved biologically exist , how likely are they to possess reflection symmetry ? Quite likely . Given the universality of the laws of physics , and in particular the laws of gravity and motion , life forms on planets outside the solar system face some of the same environmental challenges that life on Earth does . The gravitational force still holds everything on the surface of the planet and creates a significant discrimination between up and down . Locomotion similarly separates the front end from the rear . E.T . is or was most likely ambidextrous . This does not mean , however , that any delegation of visiting aliens would look anything like us . Any civilization sufficiently evolved to engage in interstellar travel has likely long passed the merger of an intelligent species with its far superior **30;868;TOOLONG creatures . A computer-based super-intelligence is most likely to be microscopic in size . // Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human-created objects that are symmetric with respect to mirror reflections . If you hold a sheet of paper with the letters A , H , I , M , O , T , U , V , W , X , Y up to a mirror , the letters look the same . Words ( or even entire phrases ) constructed from these letters and printed vertically , such as the not-too-deep instruction remain unchanged when mirror reflected . The Swedish pop-music group ABA , whose music inspired the successful musical Mamma Mia , introduced a trick into the spelling of its name that makes it mirror symmetric ( MAMMA MIA written vertically is also mirror symmetric ) . A few letters , such as B , C , D , E , H , I , K , O , X , are symmetric with respect to reflection in a mirror that bisects them horizontally . Words composed of these letters , such as COOKBOOK , BOX , CODEX , or the familiar symbols for hugs and kisses , XOXO , remain unchanged when held upside down to a mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and aesthetic appreciation , to the mathematical theory of symmetries , to the laws of physics , and to science in general , can not be overemphasized , and I will return to it several times . Other symmetries do exist , however , and they are equally relevant . // The Frolic Architecture of Snow // The title of this section is taken from " The Snowstorm " by the American poet and essayist Ralph Waldo Emerson ( 1803-82 ) . It expresses the bewilderment one feels upon discerning the spectacular shapes of snowflakes . While the common phrase " no two snowflakes are alike " is actually not true at the naked-eye level , snowflakes that have formed in different environments are indeed different . The famous astronomer Johannes Kepler ( 1571-1630 ) , who discovered the laws of planetary motion , was so impressed with the marvels of snowflakes that he devoted an entire treatise , The Six-Cornered Snowflake , to the attempt to explain the symmetry of snowflakes . In addition to mirror-reflection symmetry , snowflakes possess rotational symmetry  --  you can rotate them by certain angles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the center ) and they remain the same . Due to the properties and shape of water molecules , snowflakes have typically six ( almost ) identical corners . Consequently , the smallest rotation angle ( other than no rotation at all ) that leaves the shape unchanged is one in which each corner is displaced by one " step " : 360 4 6 5 60 degrees . The other angles that lead to an indistinguishable final figure are simple multiples of this angle : 120 , 180 , 240 , 300 , 360 degrees ( the last one returns the snowflake to its original position and is equivalent to no rotation at all ) . Snowflakes therefore have sixfold rotational symmetry . By comparison , starfish have fivefold rotational symmetry ; they can be rotated by 72 , 144 , 216 , 288 , and 360 degrees with no discernable difference . Many flowers , such as the chrysanthemum , the English daisy , and the tickseed ( coreopsis ) , display an approximate rotational symmetry . They look essentially the same when rotated by any angle . Symmetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an underlying property that gives flowers their universal aesthetic appeal . Perhaps no one has expressed better the associative relationship between flowers and works of art than the painter James McNeill Whistler ( 1834-1903 ) : // The masterpiece should appear as the flower to the painter  --  perfect in its bud as in its bloom  --  with no reason to explain its presence  --  no mission to fulfill  --  a joy to the artist , a delusion to the philanthropist  --  a puzzle to the botanist  --  an accident of sentiment and alliteration to the literary man . // What is it in a symmetric pattern that provokes such an emotional response ? And is this truly the same excitement that is stimulated by works of art ? Note that even if the answer to the latter question is an unequivocal yes , this does not necessarily bring us any closer to answering the first question . The answer to the question , What is it in works of art that provokes an emotional response ? is far from clear . Indeed , what quality is shared by such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earring , Pablo Picasso 's Guernica , and Andy Warhol 's Marilyn Diptych ? Clive Bell ( 1881-1964 ) , an art critic and member of the Bloomsbury group ( which , by the way , included novelist Virginia Woolf ) , suggested that the one quality common to all true works of art was what he called " significant form . " By this he meant a particular combination of lines , colors , forms , and relations of forms that stirs our emotions . This is not to say that all works of art evoke the same emotion . Quite the contrary : every work of art may evoke an entirely different emotion . The commonality is in the fact that all works of art do evoke some emotion . If we were to accept this aesthetic hypothesis , then symmetry may simply represent one of the components of this ( rather vaguely defined ) significant form . In this case , our reaction to symmetric patterns may not be too different ( even if less intense perhaps ) from our broader aesthetic sensibility . Not all agree with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say about the human response to symmetry of individual elements or objects , such as snowflakes : " They can arouse interest , curiosity and admiration . But visual interest in them is short-lived and superficial : In contrast to the impact of an artistic masterpiece , perceptual attention soon wanders , never goes deep . There is no enhancement of perception . " Actually , as I will show in the next chapter and in chapter 8 , symmetry has much to do with perception . For the moment , however , let me concentrate on the purely aesthetic " value " of symmetry . // Dartmouth College psychologists Peter G. Szilagyi and John C. Baird conducted a fascinating experiment in 1977 that was intended to explore the quantitative relationship between the amount of symmetry in designs and aesthetic preference . Twenty undergraduate students ( the most common subjects of experimental psychology ) were asked to perform three simple tasks . In the first , they were invited to arrange eight squares with a black dot at their centers inside a row of eighteen cells , each of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the subjects were to arrange the pieces in a manner that they found " visually pleasing . " Each piece had to cover one cell entirely , and all the squares had to be used . The second and third tasks were similar in nature . In the second , eleven pieces had to be arranged in a 5 3 5 grid . In the third , twelve cubes had to be fitted into holes in a three-dimensional transparent structure consisting of three horizontal planes , each containing nine square holes . The results showed an unambiguous aesthetic preference for symmetrical designs . For instance , 65 percent of the subjects created perfect **27;900;TOOLONG patterns in the first task . In fact , symmetry was the primary component in the designs of most subjects ( in one , two , and three dimensions ) , with perfect symmetry being the most favored condition . // The association between symmetry and artistic taste emerged not just in experiments , but also in a more speculative theory of aesthetics developed by the famous Harvard mathematician George David Birkhoff ( 1884-1944 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geometric conjecture formulated by the French mathematician Henri Poincare , and for his ergodic theorem ( published in 1931-32 )  --  a contribution of paramount significance for the theory of gases and for probability theory . During his undergraduate days , Birkhoff started to be intrigued by the structure of music , and around 1924 he expanded his interests to aesthetics in general . In 1928 , he spent half a year traveling extensively in Europe and the Far East in an attempt to absorb as much art , music , and poetry as he could . His efforts to develop a mathematical theory of aesthetic value culminated in the publication of Aesthetic Measure in 1933 . Birkhoff specifically discusses the intuitive feeling of value evoked by works of art , which is " clearly separable from sensuous , emotional , moral , or intellectual feeling . " He separates the aesthetic experience into three phases : ( 1 ) the effort of attention necessary for perception ; ( 2 ) the realization that the object is distinguished by a certain order ; ( 3 ) the appreciation of value that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the three stages . The preliminary effort , he suggests , increases in proportion to the complexity of the work ( denoted by C ) . Symmetries play a key role in the order ( denoted by O ) characterizing the object . Finally , the feeling of value is what Birkhoff calls the " aesthetic measure " ( denoted by M ) of the work of art . // The essence of Birkhoff 's theory can be summarized as follows . Within each class of aesthetic objects , such as ornaments , vases , pieces of music , or poetry , one can define an order O and a complexity C. The aesthetic measure of any object in the class can then be calculated simply by dividing O by C. In other words , Birkhoff proposed a formula for the feeling of aesthetic value : M 5 O 4 C. The meaning of this formula is : For a given degree of complexity , the aesthetic measure is higher the more order the object possesses . Alternatively , if the amount of order is specified , the aesthetic measure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most practical purposes , the order is determined primarily by the symmetries of the object , Birkhoff 's theory heralds symmetry as a crucial aesthetic element . // Birkhoff was the first to admit that the precise definitions of his elements O , C , and M were tricky . Nevertheless , he made a valiant attempt to provide detailed prescriptions for the calculation of these measures for a variety of art forms . In particular , he started with simple geometrical shapes , continued with ornaments and Chinese vases , proceeded to harmony in the diatonic musical scale , and concluded with the poetry of Tennyson , Shakespeare , and Amy Lowell. // No one , especially not Birkhoff himself , would claim that the intricacies of aesthetic pleasure could be reduced entirely to a mere formula . However , in Birkhoff 's words , " In the inevitable analytic accompaniment of the creative process , the theory of aesthetic measure is capable of performing a double service : it gives a simple , unified account of the aesthetic experience , and it provides means for the systematic analysis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief detour into the land of aesthetics to the specific case of rotational symmetry , we note that one of the simplest rotationally symmetric figures in the plane is a circle . If you rotate it around its center through , say , 37 degrees , it remains unchanged . In fact you can rotate it through any angle around a perpendicular axis through its center and you will not notice any difference . The circle therefore has an infinite number of rotational symmetries . These are not the only symmetries the circle possesses . Reflections in all the axes that cut along a diameter ( figure 8b ) also leave the circle unchanged . // The same system can , therefore , have multiple symmetries , or be symmetric under a variety of symmetry transformations . Rotating a perfect sphere about its center , using an axis running in any direction , leaves it looking precisely the same . Or examine , for instance , the equilateral ( all sides the same ) triangle . We are allowed neither to change the shape or size of this triangle , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to it to leave it unchanged ? We could rotate it by 120 , 240 , and 360 degrees around an axis perpendicular to the plane of the figure and passing through point O. These transformations do interchange the locations of the vertices , but if you turn your back while somebody is performing these rotations you wo n't notice anything different . Note that a rotation by 360 degrees is equivalent to doing nothing at all , or rotating by zero degrees . This is known as the identity transformation . Why bother to define such a transformation at all ? As we shall see later in the book , the identity transformation plays a similar role to that of the number zero in the arithmetic operation of addition or the number one in multiplication  --  when you add zero to a number or multiply a number by one , the number remains unchanged . We can also mirror-reflect the triangle about the three dashed lines in figure 9c . There are , therefore , precisely six symmetry transformations  --  three rotations and three reflections  --  associated with the equilateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transformations , such as a reflection followed by a rotation ? Do n't they add to the number of symmetries of the triangle ? I shall return to this question in the context of the language of symmetries . For the moment , however , another important symmetry awaits exposition . // Morris , Mozart , and Company // One of the most familiar of all symmetric patterns is that of a repeating , recurring motif . From friezes of classical temples and pillars of palaces to carpets and even birdsong , the symmetry of repeating patterns has always produced a very comforting familiarity and a reassuring effect . // The symmetry transformation in this case is called translation , meaning a displacement or shift by a certain distance along a certain line . The pattern is called symmetric if it can be displaced in various directions without looking any different . In other words , regular designs in which the same theme repeats itself at fixed intervals possess translational symmetry . Ornaments that are symmetric under translation can be traced all the way back to 17,000 BC ( the Paleolithic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is marked with a repeating zigzag pattern . Other translation-symmetric designs are found in a variety of art forms ranging from medieval Islamic tiling in the Alhambra palace in Granada , Spain , through Renaissance typography , to the drawings of the fantastic Dutch graphic artist M. C. Escher ( 1898-1972 ) . Nature also provides examples of translation-symmetric creatures , such as the centipedes , in which identical body segments may repeat as many as 170 times . // The Victorian artist , poet , and printer William Morris ( 1834-96 ) was a prolific producer of decorative art . Much of his work is literally the embodiment of translational symmetry . Early in life , Morris became fascinated by medieval architecture , and at age twenty-seven he started a firm of decorators that later became famous as Morris and Company . In a strong reaction to the increasing industrialism in nineteenth-century England , Morris looked for ways to revive artistic craftsmanship and to revitalize the splendor of the decorative arts of the Middle Ages . Morris and Company , and later the Kelmscott Press founded by Morris in 1890 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrated manuscripts in medieval design . But it was in wallpaper design where Morris first achieved his incredible mastery of translation-symmetric repeating patterns . A couple of his sumptuous themes are shown in figure 11 . While Morris 's designs may not have been any more innovative than those of some of his contemporaries , such as Christopher Dresser or A. W. N. Pugin , his influence and legacy have been enormous . Morris himself was interested in promoting arts and crafts and not in the mathematics of symmetry . In The Beauty of Life he summarized his socio-aesthetic philosophy this way : // You may hang your walls with tapestry instead of whitewash or paper ; or you may cover them with mosaic ; or have them frescoed by a great painter : all this is not luxury , if it be done for beauty 's sake , and not for show : it does not break our golden rule : Have nothing in your houses which you do not know to be useful or believe to be beautiful . // An interesting question is whether symmetry with respect to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ limited to the visual arts , or may be exhibited by other artistic forms , such as pieces of music . Evidently , if we refer to the sounds , rather than to the layout of the written musical score , we would have to define symmetry operations in terms other than purely geometrical , just as we did in the case of the palindromes . Once we do that , however , the answer to the question , Can we find translation-symmetric music ? is a resounding yes . As Russian crystal physicist G. V. Wulff wrote in 1908 : " The spirit of music is rhythm . It consists of the regular , periodic repetition of parts of the musical composition ... the regular repetition of identical parts in the whole constitutes the essence of symmetry . " Indeed , the recurring themes that are so common in musical composition are the temporal equivalents of Morris 's designs and symmetry under translation . Even more generally , compositions are often based on a fundamental motif introduced at the beginning and then undergoing various metamorphoses. // Simple examples of symmetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's famous Symphony no. 40 in G Minor , as well as the entire structure of some common musical forms . In the former example you can see the translational symmetry not only within each line of the score ( where the short declining gestures are marked ) , but also between the first line and the second ( denoted by a and b ) . In terms of overall design , if we use the symbols A , B , and C to describe entire sections of a movement , then the pattern for a rondo as a whole , for instance , can be expressed as ABACA or ABACABA , where the translational symmetry is apparent . Mozart 's association with objects of mathematics should come as no surprise . His sister , Nannerl , recalled that he once covered the walls of the staircase and of all the rooms in their house with numbers , and when no space remained , he moved on to the walls of a neighboring house . Even the margins of Mozart 's manuscript for the Fantasia and Fugue in C Major contain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder then that British musicologist and composer Donald Tovey identified the " beautiful and symmetrical proportions " of Mozart 's compositions as one of the key reasons for their popularity . // Another great composer known for his obsession with numbers , mental games , and their use in complex musical form was Johann Sebastian Bach ( 1685-1750 ) . Both reflection and translation feature frequently in Bach 's music on many levels . An example encompassing reflection by a horizontal " mirror " is the opening of Bach 's Two-Part Invention no. 6 in E Major . Imagine a mirror in the space between the two score lines . The ascending trend marked by line a is reflected ( half a bit later ) by the descending trend b , and the entire gesture is reflected and repeated again slightly later ( starting at d ) . Another example is provided by the entire large-scale structure of one of Bach 's most notable works , the famous Musical Offering . The composition consists of these musical forms : // Ricercar 5 Canons Trio Sonata 5 Canons // Ricercar // It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // Ricercar ( from ricercare  --  " to research , or seek out " ) was an old term used loosely for any type of prelude , usually in fugal style . The great humanitarian , physician , and philosopher Albert Schweitzer ( 1875-1965 ) was also a great Bach enthusiast . In his book J. S. Bach he notes : " The word ricercar signifies a piece of music in which we have to seek something  --  namely a theme . " The Musical Offering also contains ten canons , which , by construction , involve the operation of translation . In any canon ( the word means " rule " ) , one melodic strand determines the rule ( in terms of melodic line or rhythm ) for the second or more voices . The second voice follows at some fixed interval of time  --  a temporal translation . A simple , familiar example is // Row row row your boat // Gently down the stream // Merrily merrily merrily merrily // Life is but a dream , // where the second voice starts when the first reaches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Musical Offering is in itself truly fascinating . Three years before his death , Bach was on his way to Berlin to visit his daughter-in-law Johanna Maria Dannemann ( wife of the composer Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach ) , who was at the time expecting a child . Exhausted from the long journey , the aged composer made a stop at Potsdam , then the seat of King Frederick the Great of Prussia , who also employed Carl Philipp Emanuel . The news of Bach 's arrival at the royal palace prompted the king to cancel a planned evening concert featuring himself playing on the flute in favor of an impromptu series of recitals by Bach on seven new fortepianos . Gottfried Silbermann , the master organ builder of the German baroque , constructed these instruments . Following a virtuoso performance in seven different rooms of the palace , Bach offered to his delighted audience to improvise a fugue on a theme His Royal Highness would suggest . Upon returning home , Bach developed the Musical Offering from that improvised fugue . He added to it a set of magnificently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other contrapuntal movements . The sonata featured a flute ( King Frederick 's instrument ) , a violin , and continuo ( keyboard and cello ) . For the title of the Offering , the ever word-playful Bach chose Regis iussu cantio et reliqua canonica arte resoluta ( Upon the King 's Demand the Theme and Additions Resolved in Canonic Style ) , which forms the acronym RICERCAR. // There are even more symmetries in the Musical Offering . In Canon I ( the Crab Canon ) , each violin plays the other 's part backward , resulting in reflection symmetry ( of the score ) in a vertical mirror . Finally , canons in general were considered at the time to be some sort of symmetry puzzles . The composer provided the theme , but it was the musicians ' task to figure out what type of symmetry operation he had in mind for the theme to be performed . In the case of the Musical Offering , Bach accompanied the last two canons before the trio sonata with the inscription " Quaerendo inventis , " meaning " Seek , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in chapter 7 , this is not very different conceptually from the puzzle posed to us by the universe  --  it lies in all its glory open to inspection  --  for us to find the underlying patterns and symmetries . Even the uncertainties and ambiguities involved in the attempts to uncover the " theory of everything " may have an analogy in Bach 's intellectual challenge . You see , one of the canons in the Musical Offering has three possible solutions . // Translation and reflection can be combined into one symmetry operation known as glide reflection . The footprints generated by an alternating left-right-left-right walk exhibit glide-reflection symmetry . The operation consists simply of a translation ( the glide ) , followed by a reflection in a line parallel to the direction of the displacement ( the dashed line in the figure ) . Equivalently , you could look at glide reflection as a mirror reflection followed by a translation parallel to the mirror . Glide-reflection symmetry is common in classical friezes , and also in the ceramics of native Americans in New Mexico . Whereas patterns that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one direction , **26;929;TOOLONG designs create a snakelike visual sensation . Real snakes achieve these patterns by alternately contracting and relaxing muscle groups on both sides of their body  --  when they contract a group on the right , the corresponding group on the left is relaxed , and vice versa. // We have by now encountered all the rigid transformations that result in symmetries in two dimensions . The word rigid simply means that after the transformation every two points end up the same distance apart as they were to begin with  --  we can not shrink figures , inflate them , or deform them . // In three-dimensional space , in addition to the symmetry under translation , rotation , reflection , and glide reflection , we can find yet another symmetry known as screw symmetry . This is the type of symmetry of a corkscrew , where rotation about some axis is combined with translation along that axis . Some stems of plants , where the leaves appear at regular intervals after completing the same fraction of a full circle around the stem , possess this symmetry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // All Are Equal , But ... // The arts and sciences are chock-full of fascinating examples of symmetry under the operations of translation , rotation , reflection , and glide reflection , and we shall return to some of those in later chapters . // Permutations feature in such diverse circumstances as the changing of partners in Scottish folk dancing and shuffled decks of cards . The main concern of the operation of permutations is not so much with which object lies where , as with which object takes the place of which . For example , in the permutation : 1 2 3 4 - &gt; 4 1 3 2 , the number 1 was replaced by 4 , 2 was replaced by 1 , 3 stayed put , and 4 was replaced by 2 . This is usually denoted by // 1234 // 4132 ' // where each number in the upper row is replaced by the number directly underneath . The same permutation operation could have been written as // 3214 // 3142 // because precisely the same replacements took place , and the order in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder how can a system be symmetric ( i.e. , not change ) under permutations ? Evidently , if you have ten books on a shelf and they are all different , any permutation that is not the identity ( leaving the books untouched ) will change the order . However , if you have three copies of the same book , for example , clearly some permutations will leave the order unchanged . The English essayist and critic Charles Lamb ( 1775-1834 ) , known for his self-revealing observations of life , had a rather strong opinion on some such book " rearrangements . " He writes , " The human species , according to the best theory I can form of it , is composed of two distinct races , the men who borrow , and the men who lend .... Your borrowers of books  --  those mutilators of collections , spoilers of the symmetry of shelves , and creators of odd volumes . " // Symmetry under permutation can appear in more abstract circumstances . Examine the contents of the phrase " Rachel is David 's cousin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rachel . The same is not true for the phrase " Rachel is David 's daughter . " Similarly , the equality between two quantities , a 5 b , is symmetric under the transposition of a and b , since b 5 a is the same relation . While this may seem trivial , the relation " greater than " ( commonly denoted by the symbol $ ) does not have this property . The relation a $ b means " a is greater than b . " Permuting the letters results in b $ a , " b is greater than a , " and the two relations are mutually exclusive . // Various mathematical formulae can also be symmetric under permutations . The value of the expression ab 1 bc 1 ca ( where ab means " a times b " and so on ) remains unchanged under any permutation of the letters a , b , c . As I shall discuss in more detail later , there are precisely six possible permutations of three letters , including one ( the first below ) that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abc abc abc abc abc abc // abc acb bca cab cba bac // You can easily check that the above expression is unaltered by these permutations . For instance , the third permutation changes a into b , b into c , and c into a . The entire formula therefore changes to read : bc 1 ca 1 ab . However , since in whichever order we either multiply numbers or add them up the result is always the same , the new expression is equal to the original one . // People playing roulette in a casino provide an interesting case of symmetry under permutations . The roulette is composed of a rotating wheel in which eighteen numbered red slots , eighteen black slots , and two green slots commonly labeled 0 and 00 are marked . A white ball is dropped onto the spinning wheel , and after rolling rapidly around the rim a few times , it bounces around and eventually lands and comes to rest in one of the slots . When the wheel is mechanically perfect , the game of roulette is absolutely symmetric @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same chance to win or lose irrespective of whether they are casino rats or novices , experts in probability theory or village idiots . The expectation to win ( rather to lose , about 5.3 cents for every dollar bet , on the average ) does not depend on the amount of money being risked or on the player 's strategy . While no mechanical wheel can be truly perfect , centuries of profits for casinos prove that , whatever small deviations may exist , they do not lead to a significant violation of the symmetry under permutations . // Not all gambling activities are symmetric under permutations of the players . Blackjack is a card game in which each gambler at the table plays against the dealer . Each number card has its face value , with all the picture cards having the value of ten , and the ace offering the option of being counted as one or eleven . The objective is to get the sum of the values of the dealt cards to be closer to twenty-one than the dealer 's hand without exceeding twenty-one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players is precisely the fact that strategy is important . In the 1960s casinos discovered the hard way the extent to which strategy counts . Mathematician Edward O. Thorp uncovered a flaw in the way casinos were calculating probabilities when the deck of cards was dwindling down . He used this information to develop an extremely profitable method of play . In case you wonder , the casinos have since taken corrective action . Nonetheless , it remains true that strategy does make a difference in blackjack . Indeed , six MIT students who communicated with card-count code words made millions in Las Vegas in the 1990s. // Permutation symmetry and some of its scientific close cousins have far-reaching consequences in the physics of the subatomic world , and we shall return to some of those in chapter 7 . Here I will only mention briefly one simple example that explains an otherwise perplexing fact about atoms of different elements  --  they are all roughly the same size . // Atoms somewhat resemble miniature solar systems . The electrons in the atom are orbiting a central nucleus , just as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds the electrons in their orbits , however , is electromagnetic , rather than gravitational . The nucleus contains protons that have positive electric charges ( and neutrons , which are neutral ) , while the orbiting electrons ( equal in number to the protons ) are negatively charged . Opposite electric charges attract each other . Unlike planetary systems , which can have orbits of any size , atoms must obey the rules of the subatomic realm  --  quantum mechanics . The highest probability of finding the electrons is along certain specific , " quantized " orbits , restricted to a particular series of discrete sizes . The permitted orbits are characterized mainly by their energy . Broadly speaking , the higher the energy associated with the orbit , the larger its size . The situation is somewhat analogous to a flight of stairs , with the nucleus representing the bottom and the higher energy levels corresponding to increasingly higher steps . Here , however , comes the puzzle . Physics , and indeed everyday life , teach us that systems are most stable in their lowest possible energy state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stability at the bottom ) . This would mean that whether we are dealing with the hydrogen atom , which has only one electron , the oxygen atom , with eight electrons , or uranium , ninety-two electrons , all the electrons would be clustered in the smallest possible orbit . Because the more electron- and proton-rich atoms are , the stronger the electrical attraction between the nucleus and the electrons , we would expect that the oxygen atom would be smaller than the hydrogen atom , and the uranium atom much smaller still . Experiments show , however , that this is far from being the case . Rather , irrespective of the number of electrons , the atoms are found to be roughly the same size . Why ? // The explanation was given by the famous physicist Wolfgang Pauli ( 1900-58 ) . He proposed in 1925 a powerful law of nature ( which won him the Nobel Prize in 1945 ) , known as the Pauli exclusion principle . The law refers to some elementary particles of the same type , such as electrons . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their intrinsic properties  --  there is no way to distinguish one from the other . In addition to their mass and electric charge , electrons have another fundamental property called spin . Spin could be thought of , for some purposes , as if the electron were a tiny ball spinning around its axis . Quantum mechanics  --  the theory that describes atoms , light , and subatomic particles  --  tells us that the electron spin can have only two states ( loosely analogous to the ball spinning at a specific rate in one or the opposite direction ) . The Pauli exclusion principle asserts that no two electrons can be in precisely the same state ; that is , having exactly the same orbit and direction of spin . How is this related to symmetry ? To phrase the exclusion principle more accurately , we need to realize that quantum mechanics speaks in the language of probabilities . We can never determine precisely the location of an electron within the atom . Rather , we can only determine the different probabilities of finding it at various positions . The collection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ function . The probability function plays the role of a map , showing us where we are most likely to find the electron . Accordingly , Pauli also formulated his exclusion principle in terms of a property of the probability function describing the motion of electrons in the atom . He stated that the probability function is antisymmetrical with respect to interchanging any electron pair . Such a function is called antisymmetrical if transposing two electrons that move along the same orbit and have the same spin direction changes only the sign of the function ( e.g. , from plus to minus ) , but not its value . For instance , imagine that the letter a symbolizes the value of some property of the first electron , and the letter b the value of the same property for the second electron . A function that takes the value a 1 b is symmetrical under the exchange of the two electrons since a 1 b equals b 1 a . On the other hand , a function represented by a 2 b is antisymmetrical , since changing a to b and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a , and b 2 a is precisely the negative of a 2 b ( e.g. , 5 2 3 5 2 ; 3 2 5 5 22 ) . // Pauli 's statement is therefore the crux of the matter . On one hand , we know that if we interchange two identical electrons this should make no difference whatsoever , and the probability function should remain unchanged . On the other , the exclusion principle tells us that the probability function should change its sign ( e.g. , from positive to negative ) under such a permutation . What kind of number is equal to the negative of itself ? There is only one such number  --  zero . Changing the sign in front of a zero does not change the value by one iota ; minus zero equals plus zero . In other words , the probability of finding two electrons with the same spin moving along the same orbit is zero  --  no such state exists . // Pauli 's exclusion principle tells us that electrons with the same properties do n't like to be bunched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two electrons ( one with each direction of spin ) are allowed in any given orbit . Instead of all the electrons crowding the smallest ( lowest energy ) orbit , electrons are forced into successively higher-energy , larger-size orbits . The net result is that even though the sizes of all the quantized orbits are smaller in the heavier ( more proton-rich ) atoms , electrons have no choice but to occupy an increasing number of orbits . Amazingly , the behavior of the probability function under permutations of electrons provides the explanation why atoms are nearly equal in size . // Returning now to permutations in general , color transformation may be considered as near kin . For any pattern that has more than one color , such as a chessboard , the colors can be interchanged . Strictly speaking , actual patterns are usually not symmetrical under color transformation  --  they do change . A few of the imaginative designs of M. C. Escher come just about as close as one can expect to being color symmetrical . Note that the image does not remain truly the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chessboard . However , the general visual impression remains the same . // Escher himself was never quite sure what had led him to his obsession with translation-symmetric , color-symmetric patterns . In his own words , // I often wondered at my own mania of making periodic drawings . Once I asked a friend of mine , a psychologist , about the reason of my being so fascinated by them , but his answer : that I must be driven by a primitive , prototypical instinct , does not explain anything . What can be the reason of my being alone in this field ? Why does none of my fellow-artists seem to be as fascinated as I am by these interlocking shapes ? Yet their rules are purely objective ones , which every artist could apply in his own personal way ! // Escher 's retrospective musings touch upon two important topics : the role of symmetry in the " primitive " process of perception , and the rules that underlie symmetry . The latter topic will be the subject of several later chapters . However , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our senses , the question of symmetry as a potential factor in perception becomes of immediate relevance . //
