Tech stocks are hot again . Three of Wall Street 's top tech watchers consider whether we 're back in bubble territory // Three years after the tech and telecom bubble burst , wiping out trillions in shareholder value , technology stocks are roaring back . Even though the Nasdaq is still far from its March 2000 high , it 's up 45% so far this year , and some market watchers have begun to worry about the possibility of an echo bubble . This month I asked three Wall Street tech watchers about the recent run-up in technology stocks-have we come too far too fast ? Their responses were mixed , but each was compelling A NEW TECH BUBBLE ? Steve Milunovich , chief global technol- ogy strategist at Merrill Lynch , is the most cautious of the group . He 's wor- ried that we are back in a mini-bubble . " I think there 's a bit of a disconnect between the fundamentals and the stock prices , " he says . He attributes much of the stock gains to the Federal Reserve 's policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible that fundamentals will improve sufficiently next year to allow earnings to grow into the current valuations , " he allows . But he warns that " valuations are stretched , and if there is any disappointment in the economy and in technology earnings next year , we could have a severe correction . " Thomas Smith , director of information technology research at Standard &; Poor 's , is more upbeat . " Nasdaq put on its antigravity boots , " he quips . " It just wo n't fall . " He sees a broad uptick for the whole sector . " In some cases with tech companies , we 've already begun to see some actual tangible improvement in earnings , " he says . Tobias Levkovich , chief U.S. equity strategist for Citigroup Smith Barney , says there are a number of indicators that suggest we are not back in bubble territory . " First of all , many of the stocks that were at $100 and went down to $2 are not back at $100 , " he points out . Second , " there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had before , but the money flows into equity mutual funds are about half of what they were in the early part of 2000 . " Equity fund flows are at about $2.0 billion a month right now vs. $40 billion a month in March 2000 . " If you took the Nasdaq as a statistic , " Levkovich continues , " it peaked somewhere close to 5200 , it went down to 1100 , and now we 're at 1900 , and all of a sudden there 's a bubble ? We 're still more than 60% below the peaks . " Valuations in and of themselves are not the issue , according to Levkovich . " Investors are still kind of hung over with the fear that valuations are what made them make the grand investment mistake in 2000 . " He contends that the real issue is the inputs into valuations-namely , the earnings side of the P/E . Unlike in the ' 90s , he says , investors are now paying high valuations on trough earnings rather than peak earnings . " In 2000 , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through in the future , people paid high valuations on what proved to be peak earnings , and as a result , as the earnings flow started to fall so did stock prices . " " A RELUCTANT RUN-UP " Milunovich has his own theory about why the Nasdaq is posting stronger gains than the S &P; and the Dow . " People remember how much money they made a few years ago , " he says , " and even though a lot of people got burned , diey 're anxious to make it back and tend to go back to the same names . " Levkovich , however , attributes the Nasdaq 's stronger gains , at least in part , to recent strength in capital spending . " The area we 've been waiting for is capital spending , and IT information technology is roughly half of capital spending . " Levkovich refers to the tech-stock surge as a reluctant run-up , in which " the analysts are chasing what 's been happening in the marketplace and the learnings trends . " After predicting recoveries in the second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , analysts were a little sheepish : " This time they came in saying , ' We 've been burned three times ; I 'm not coming in with a significant second-half expectation for recovery , ' and then , of course , it happened . " LOOKING AHEAD All three agree that some parts of the tech sector will perform better than others-and that semiconductors should be among the winners . Smith , who describes semiconductors as " a leading-edge industry , " likes Analog Devices , Intel , Texas Instruments and Microchip Technology . Of the chip equipment makers , he prefers Teradyne and Cadence Design Systems . " In the first year of the comeback , lower-quality names out-paid some of the bigger ones , " he adds , " but as things broaden put , I think bigger ones will do better . " Among them : Automatic Data Processing , Cisco , IBM and Microsoft . Levkovich also suggests Intel as a pure play on semiconductors . But he warns that what looks good now may not look as good in even a few months . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one may have to rent stocks rather than own them right now , " Levkovich says . " I think that the higher beta more volatile areas like semiconductors will probably do better initially and then back off next year . " Echoing that sentiment , Milunovich predicts that " semiconductor stocks ... will probably go up for now because there 's low inventory in tech and there is some component build going on . " But he cautions , " I would guess that as we get into next year there 's going to be increasing risk in the Semiconductor names . " He also mentions Intel as an innovative company that is benefiting from the pickup in PC demand . Other Milunovich picks : Qualcomm in the wireless space and Mercury Interactive on the software side . As for tech companies to avoid , Smith mentions Real Networks as a company with too much concept and not enough earnings . " The laggard industry in technology as we see it is telecom equipment , which is dependent on capital expenditures by largely American telephone companies , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , " Smith adds , " it 's hard to find tech stocks that you 'd like to short on a broad basis because you think they 'll fall absolutely . " Milunovich says EDS will continue to be vulnerable , as will Infineon , a DRAM dynamic RAM maker . " We have some concerns that DRAM prices may begin to soften next year , " he explains . And he finds communications equipment company Juniper very expensive now . Like Smith , Levkovich sees softness in telecom capital spending , so he 's cautious about Lucent and JDS Uniphase . He also notes that Sun Microsystems lacks what he calls the Wintel combiination : " Windows and Intel-it 's just the way most corporations have structured their systems . " While tech-stock gains have been remarkable this year , we are still a long way from the excesses of the late ' 90s . ( But the sector 's earnings are also a long way from its lofty price gains . Wise investors would do well to remember the primary lesson of the late ' 90s : Earnings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sidebar Milunovich warns that " we could have a severe correction " if tech earnings next year are disappointing Sidebar " Nasdaq put on its antigravity boots , " says S &P's; Smith .
