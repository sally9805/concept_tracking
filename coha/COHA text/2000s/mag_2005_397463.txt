Section : Special Report How jihadist groups are using organized-crime tactics  --  and profits  --  to finance attacks on targets around the globe <p> The first blast struck at 1:25 p.m. , shattering the walls of the Bombay Stock Exchange , leaving a grisly scene of broken bodies , shattered glass , and smoke . Next to be hit was the main office of the national airline , Air India , followed by the Central Bazaar and major hotels . At the international airport , hand grenades were thrown at jets parked on the tarmac . For nearly two hours the carnage went on , as unknown assailants wreaked havoc upon one of the world 's largest cities . In all , 10 bombs packed with plastic explosives rocked Bombay , killing 257 and injuring over 700 . <p> What happened in Bombay on that day , March 12 , 1993 , was a chilling precursor to the 9/11 terrorist attacks , a careful choreography of death and destruction , aimed at the heart of a nation 's financial center and intended to maximize civilian casualties . Engineered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revenge for deadly riots by Hindu fundamentalists that had claimed over a thousand lives , most of them Muslim . But more than vengeance was at work in Bombay . Indian police later recovered an arsenal big enough to spark a civil war : nearly 4 tons of explosives , 1,100 detonators , nearly 500 grenades , 63 assault rifles , and thousands of rounds of ammunition . Within days of the attacks , police had gotten their first break by tracing an abandoned van filled with a load of weapons . The trail soon led to a surprising suspect : not a terrorist but a gangster . And not just any gangster but an extraordinary crime boss , a man known as South Asia 's Al Capone . <p> Virtually unknown in the West , Dawood Ibrahim is a household name across the region , his exploits known by millions . He is , by all accounts , a world-class mobster , a soft-spoken , murderous businessman from Bombay who now lives in exile , sheltered by India 's archenemy , Pakistan . He is India 's godfather of godfathers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bangkok to Dubai . Strong-arm protection , drug trafficking , extortion , murder-for-hire  --  all are stock-in-trade rackets , police say , of Dawood Ibrahim 's syndicate , the innocuously named D Company . <p> Dawood , as he is known in the Indian press , is very much on Washington 's radar screen today . Two years ago , the Treasury Department quietly designated Ibrahim a " global terrorist " for lending his smuggling routes to al Qaeda , supporting jihadists in Pakistan , and helping engineer the 1993 attack on Bombay . He is far and away India 's most wanted man , his name invoked time and again by Indian officials in their discussions of terrorism with U.S. diplomats and intelligence officers . As a result of those discussions , the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration each have active investigations into Dawood 's far-flung criminal network , U.S. News has learned . <p> Understanding Dawood 's operations is important , experts say , because they show how growing numbers of terrorist groups have come to rely on the tactics  --  and profits  --  of organized criminal activity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by U.S. News , based on interviews with counterterrorism and law enforcement officials from six countries , has found that terrorists worldwide are transforming their operating cells into criminal gangs . " Transnational crime is converging with the terrorist world , " says Robert Charles , the State Department 's former point man on narcotics . Antonio Maria Costa , the head of the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime , agrees : " The world is seeing the birth of a new hybrid of **25;2777;TOOLONG organizations . We are breaking new ground . " <p> Blood money . Some scholars argue that terrorists and traditional crime groups both now exist on a single , violent plane , populated at one end by politically minded jihadists and at the other by profit-driven mobsters , with most groups falling somewhere in between . Mafia groups and drug rings in Colombia and the Balkans , for example , commit political assassinations and bomb police and prosecutors , while terrorist gangs in Europe and North Africa traffic in drugs and illegal aliens . Both crime syndicates and terrorist groups thrive in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on shifting networks and secret cells to accomplish their objectives . Both groups have similar needs : weapons , false documentation , and safe houses . <p> But some U.S. intelligence analysts see little evidence of this melding of forces . Marriages of convenience may exist , they say , but the key difference is one of motive : Terrorist groups are driven by politics and religion , while purely criminal groups have just one thing in mind  --  profit . Indeed , associating with terrorists , particularly since 9/11 , can be very bad for business  --  and while crime syndicates may be parasitical , most do not want to kill their host . <p> What many intelligence analysts do see today , however , is terrorist organizations stealing whole chapters out of the criminal playbook  --  trafficking in narcotics , counterfeit goods , illegal aliens  --  and in the process converting their terrorist cells into criminal gangs . <p> The terrorist gang behind the train bombings in Madrid last year , for example , financed itself almost entirely with money earned from trafficking in hashish and ecstasy . Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages in bank robbery and credit card fraud ; its 2002 Bali bombings were financed , in part , through jewelry store robberies that netted over 5 pounds of gold . In years past , many terrorist groups would have steered away from criminal activity , worried that such tactics might tarnish their image . But for hard-pressed jihadists , committing crimes against nonbelievers is increasingly seen as acceptable . As Abu Bakar Bashir , Jemaah Islamiyah 's reputed spiritual head , reportedly said : " You can take their blood ; then why not take their property ? " <p> The implications are troubling because organized crime offers a means for terrorist groups to increase their survivability . A Stanford University study conducted after the 9/11 attacks looked at why some conflicts last so much longer than others . One key factor : crime . Out of 128 conflicts , the 17 in which insurgents relied heavily on " contraband finances " lasted on average 48 years  --  over five times as long as the rest . " If the criminal underworld can keep terrorist coffers flush , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will continue to face an enemy that would otherwise run out of oxygen . " <p> The growing reliance on crime stems from the end of the Cold War , when state sponsorship of terrorism largely faded along with communism , forcing groups to become much more self-sufficient . Accelerating the trend , analysts say , is the crackdown since 9/11 on fundraising by Islamic radicals from mosques and charities , which has pushed their operations further toward racketeering . " The bottom line is if you want to survive today as a terrorist , you probably have to support yourself , " says Raphael Perl , a counterterrorism specialist at the Congressional Research Service . The drug trade , in particular , has proved irresistible for many . Nearly half of the 41 groups on the government 's list of terrorist organizations are tied to narcotics trafficking , according to DEA statistics . <p> Scams . The new face of terrorism can best be seen in western Europe . " Crime is now the main source of cash for Islamic radicals in Europe , " says attorney Lorenzo Vidino , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They do not need to get money wired from abroad like 10 years ago . They 're generating their own as criminal gangs . " European police and intelligence officials agree : The Continent 's most worrisome cells , composed largely of immigrants from Morocco and Algeria , have in effect become racketeering syndicates . Their scams are as varied as the criminal world : Drugs , smuggling , and fraud are mainstays , but others include car theft , selling pirated CD s , and counterfeiting money . One enterprising pair of jihadists in Germany hoped to fund a suicide mission to Iraq by taking out nearly $1 million in life insurance and staging the death of one in a faked traffic accident . Some cells are loosely bound and based on petty crime ; others , like the group behind the Madrid bombings , suggest a whole new level of sophistication . <p> The terrorists behind the Madrid attacks were major drug dealers , with a network stretching from Morocco through Spain to Belgium and the Netherlands . Their ringleader , Jamal " El Chino " Ahmidan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffickers . Ahmidan and his followers paid for their explosives by trading hashish and cash with a former miner . When police raided the home of one plotter , they seized 125,800 ecstasy tablets  --  one of the largest hauls in Spanish history . In all , authorities recovered nearly $2 million in drugs and cash from the group . In contrast , the Madrid bombings , which killed 191 people , cost only about $50,000 . <p> Similar reports of drug-dealing jihadists are coming out of France and Italy . In Milan , Islamists peddle heroin on the streets at $20 a hit and then hand off 80 percent of the take to their cell leader , according to Italy 's L'Espresso magazine . The relationship , surprisingly , is not new . As early as 1993 , says Vidino , French authorities warned that dope sales in suburban Muslim slums had fallen under the control of gangs led by Afghan war veterans with ties to Algerian terrorists . What is new is the scale of this toxic mix of jihad and dope . Moroccan terrorists used drug sales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attacks in Casablanca , killing 45 , and attempted bombings of U.S. and British ships in Gibraltar in 2002 . So large looms the North African connection that investigators believe jihadists have penetrated as much as a third of the $12.5 billion Moroccan hashish trade  --  the world 's largest  --  a development worrisome not only for its big money but for its extensive smuggling routes through Europe . <p> Along with drug trafficking , fraud of every sort is a growth industry for European jihadists . Popular scams include fake credit cards , cellphone cloning , and identity theft  --  low-level frauds that are lucrative but seldom attract the concerted attention of authorities . Some operatives are more ambitious , however . Officials point to the case of Hassan Baouchi , a 23-year-old ATM technician in France . Baouchi told police last year that he 'd been held hostage by robbers who forced him to empty six ATMs of their cash  --  about $1.3 million . Investigators did n't quite buy Baouchi 's story and soon put him under arrest ; the money , they believe , has ended up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affiliate tied to the bombings in Casablanca and Madrid . <p> Another big racket for European jihadists is human smuggling . " North Africa and western Europe are somewhat like Mexico and the United States , " says a U.S. counterterrorism agent . " But now imagine if Mexico were Muslim and jihadist cells were the ones moving aliens across the border . " Jihadists do not dominate Europe 's lucrative human smuggling trade , but they are surely profiting by it . Authorities in Italy suspect that one gang of suspected militants made over 30 landings on an island off Sicily , and that it moved thousands of people across the Mediterranean at some $4,000 a head . Particularly active is the Salafist Group for Call and Combat , an Algerian al Qaeda affiliate known by its French acronym , GSPC . Two years ago , German authorities dismantled another group moving Kurds into Europe , tied to al Qaeda ally Ansar al-Islam , a fixture of the Iraq insurgency . A recent Italian intelligence report notes that jihadists ' work in human smuggling has brought them into contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade , sources say , is the Neapolitan Camorra , the notorious Naples-based version of the Mafia , which operates safe houses for illegal aliens . Italian court records show contact between Mafia arms dealers and radical Islamists as early as 1998 . <p> Prison recruits . The prime training ground for Europe 's jihadist criminals may well be prison . There are no hard numbers , but as much as half of France 's prison population is now believed to be Muslim . In Spanish jails , where Islamic radicals have recruited for a decade , the number has reached some 10 percent . Ahmidan , leader of the Madrid bombing cell , is thought to have been radicalized while serving time in Spain and Morocco . Prison was also the recruiting center for many of the 40-plus suspects nabbed by Spanish authorities last year for plotting a sequel to the Madrid bombings  --  an attack with a half ton of explosives on Spain 's national criminal court . Nearly half the group had rap sheets with charges ranging from drug trafficking to forgery and fraud . <p> Al Qaeda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jumping into the drug trade . Holed up in the forbidding mountain refuges of the Pakistan-Afghanistan border , Osama bin Laden and his remaining lieutenants have steered clear of the largest horde of criminal wealth in years : the exploding Afghan heroin trade . Press reports of bin Laden 's involvement in the drug trade are flat wrong , say counterterrorism officials . Long ago , al Qaeda strategists reasoned that drug trafficking would expose them to possible detection , captives have told U.S. interrogators . They also do n't trust many of the big drug barons , intelligence officials say , and have encouraged their members not to get involved with them . <p> Bin Laden continues to come up with funds raised from sympathetic mosques and other supporters , but the money no longer flows so easily . Pakistan and Saudi Arabia have banned unregulated fundraising at mosques , and western spy agencies now watch closely how the money flows from big Islamic charities . One result : Cash-strapped jihadists in the badlands of the border region are staging kidnappings-for-ransom and highway robberies , Pakistani officials tell U.S. News @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " says Javed Cheema , head of the Interior Ministry 's National Crisis Management Cell . " We see a fertile symbiosis of terrorist organizations and crime groups . " Some jihadists have joined in wholesale pillaging of Afghanistan 's heritage by smuggling antiquities out of the country  --  a trade nearly as lucrative as narcotics . Among the items being sold clandestinely on the world market : centuries-old Buddhist art and other works from the pre-Islamic world . Apparently , al Qaeda 's interest is not new ; before 9/11 , hijack ringleader Mohamed Atta approached a German art professor about peddling Afghan antiquities , Germany 's Federal Criminal Police Office revealed this year . Atta 's reason , reports Der Spiegel magazine : " to finance the purchase of an airplane . " <p> Al Qaeda may be avoiding the heroin trade , but nearly everyone else in the region  --  from warlords to provincial governors to the Taliban  --  is not . The reasons are apparent : Afghanistan 's opium trade is exploding . The cultivation of opium poppies , from which heroin is made , doubled from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , last year , that amount tripled . Afghanistan now provides 87 percent of the world 's heroin . " We have never seen anything like this before , " says Charles , the former State Department narcotics chief . " No drug state ever made this much dope and so quickly . " The narcotics industry now makes up as much as half of Afghanistan 's gross domestic product , analysts estimate , and employs upward of 1 million laborers , from farmers to warehouse workers to truck drivers . And now Afghans are adding industrial-level amounts of marijuana to the mix . U.N . officials estimate that some 74,000 to 86,000 acres of pot are being grown in Afghanistan  --  over five times what is grown in Mexico . <p> Corruption . And if al Qaeda itself is staying out of drugs , its allies certainly are not . The booming drug trade has given a strong second wind to the stubborn insurgency being waged by the Taliban and Islamist warlords like Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . Both the Taliban and Hekmatyar 's Hezb-i-Islami army control key smuggling routes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protection fees on drug caravans . Crime and terrorism experts are also alarmed over the corrosive , long-term effects of all the drug money , not just within Afghanistan but across the region . The ballooning dope trade is rapidly creating narco-states in central Asia , destroying what little border control exists and making it easier for terrorist groups to operate . Ancient smuggling routes from the Silk Road to the Arabian Sea are being supercharged with tons of heroin and billions of narcodollars . Within Afghanistan , drug-fueled corruption is pervasive ; governors , mayors , police , and military are all on the take . A raid this year in strategically located Helmand province came up with a whopping 9 1/2 tons of heroin  --  stashed inside the governor 's own office . <p> The smuggling routes lead from landlocked Afghanistan to the south and east through Pakistan , to the west through Iraq , and to the north through central Asia . Throughout the region the amounts of drugs seized are jumping , along with rates of crime , drug addiction , and HIV infection . Particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Soviet republics of Kirgizstan and Tajikistan . Widely praised demonstrations in Kirgizstan this year , which overthrew the regime of strongman Askar Akayev , have brought to power an array of questionable figures . " Entire branches of government are being directed by individuals tied to organized crime , " warns Svante Cornell of the Central Asia-Caucasus Institute at Johns Hopkins University . " The whole revolution smells of opium . " <p> Neighboring republics are little better off . Central Asia 's major terrorist threat , the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan , has largely degenerated into a drug mafia , officials say . In Kazakhstan the interior minister tried to investigate corruption by going undercover in a truck packed with 9 tons of watermelons , motoring 1,200 miles from the Kirgiz Republic to the Kazakh capital . His team had to pay bribes to 36 different police and customs officials en route  --  some as little as $1.50 . ( Others merely accepted their bribe in melons . ) The cargo was never inspected . What is happening in Iran , meanwhile , is " a national tragedy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So much Afghan dope is being shipped into the country that it now has the world 's highest per capita rate of addiction . The ruling mullahs in Tehran have taken it seriously ; Iranian security forces have fought deadly battles with drug traffickers along their border , losing some 3,600 lives in the past 16 years . But even as their troops fight , the corruption has reached high officials of the Iranian government , who are using drug profits as political patronage , sources tell U.S. News . " There are indications , " says Cornell , " that hard-line conservatives are up to their ears in the Afghan opium trade . " <p> Nor has Russia escaped the heroin boom 's impact . From central Asia , growing amounts of Afghan heroin are entering the south of the country ; drug-control officials report that large numbers of Russian military are on the take , even trucking the stuff in army vehicles . The level of corruption has , in turn , raised concern over the ultimate black market : in radioactive materials . Russia 's " nuclear belt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  runs directly along those heroin smuggling routes . How bad are conditions in the area ? Bemoans one intelligence expert : " We know so little . " <p> Iraq , too , is starting to see its share of narcotics , but drugs are but a bit player in an insurgency that has also blurred the lines between terrorism and organized crime . Within Iraq 's lawless borders exists an unsavory criminal stew composed of home-grown gangsters , ex-Baathists , and jihadists . " Terrorists and insurgents are conducting a lot of criminal activities , extortion and kidnapping in particular , as a way to acquire revenues , " Caleb Temple of the Defense Intelligence Agency testified to Congress this July . Among the biggest cash cows : The insurgents take part in the wholesale theft of much of Iraq 's gasoline supply , earning millions of dollars in a thriving black market . Extortion and protection are also rife , and kidnapping for ransom has ballooned into a major industry , with up to 10 abductions a day . Among those targeted : politicians , professors , foreigners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they 've been sold to militants . <p> The insurgents are also key players in the graft and corruption that have enveloped Iraq . So much foreign aid money has disappeared that two U.S. intelligence task forces are now investigating its diversion to the insurgency , U.S. News has learned . Western aid agencies , Islamic charities , and U.S. military supply programs all have been targeted , analysts believe . Occupation authorities can not account for nearly $9 billion of oil revenues it had transferred to Iraqi government agencies between 2003 and 2004 , according to an audit by a special U.S. inspector general set up by Congress . " Even if a little bit ends up in insurgent hands , " says one official , " it does n't take a lot to build a truck bomb . " The implications are troubling : The insurgents may be using America 's own foreign aid to fund the killing of U.S. troops . <p> Back at home , U.S. officials are looking warily at the growing rackets of terrorist groups overseas and voice concern that the trend will grow here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in the United States , " says Joseph Billy , deputy chief of the FBI 's counterterrorism division . " Left unchecked , it 's very worrisome  --  this is one we have to be aggressive on . " Federal investigators have uncovered repeated scams here largely involving supporters of Hamas and Hezbollah , and they have traced tens of thousands of dollars back to those groups in the Middle East . " There 's a direct tie , " says Billy . The list of crimes includes credit card fraud , identity theft , the sale of unlicensed T-shirts  --  even the theft and resale of infant formula . Most of these U.S. rackets have been low level , but some , involving cigarette smuggling and counterfeit products , have earned their organizers millions of dollars . <p> Foreign fish . The big fish  --  the Indian mobsters , Moroccan hash dealers , and Afghan drug barons  --  are swimming overseas , however , and U.S. law enforcement is starting to train its sights on the worst of them . After being shut out of Afghanistan for two decades @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after top Afghan traffickers tied to the Taliban . DEA agents are applying the same sort of " kingpin strategy " that helped to break the Medellin and Cali cartels in Colombia by targeting whole trafficking organizations . The agency has identified some 10 of these " high-value targets , " led by Afghans who have amassed fortunes of as much as $100 million , officials say . Two already have fallen this year : In April , agents nabbed a man they 've dubbed " the Pablo Escobar of Afghanistan , " Taliban ally Bashir Noorzai , by enticing him to a New York meeting . Noorzai is said to have helped establish the modern Afghan drug trade , and so lucrative were his operations that the indictment against him calls for the seizure of $50 million in drug proceeds . Then in October , the Justice Department announced the extradition of Baz Mohammad , another alleged " Taliban-linked narcoterrorist , " charged with conspiring to import over $25 million worth of heroin into the United States and other countries . Mohammad , according to an indictment , boasted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jihad ' because they were taking the Americans ' money at the same time the heroin was killing them . " He is now awaiting trial , in a New York jail . <p> The DEA 's experience , however , illustrates some of the problems in grappling with the nexus between organized crime and terrorism . Despite post-9/11 calls for cooperation , the DEA 's ties to other U.S. agencies are often strained ; the drug agency is not even considered part of the U.S. intelligence community . Pentagon officials , worried over " mission creep , " routinely refuse to give DEA agents air support in Afghanistan . Other turf issues still plague the FBI , CIA , Homeland Security , and other agencies , making collaborative work on the crime-terrorism issue problematic . The intelligence community , for example , remains leery of seeing its people or information end up in court . " It 's the same wall we saw between law enforcement and the intelligence world , " says one insider . " Only now it 's between terrorism and other crimes . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agrees Charles , the State Department 's former top cop . " You can not meet a complex threat like this without a similar response . And we do n't have one . " Indeed , interviews with counterterrorism and law enforcement officials in a half-dozen federal agencies suggest that cooperation across the government remains episodic at best and depends most often on personal relationships . " The incentives are all still against sharing , " complains one analyst . " The leadership says yes , the policies say yes , but the culture says no . The bureaucracy has won . " <p> Washington looks like a model of cooperation compared with Europe , however , where the walls between agencies and across borders stand even higher . " If we do n't get on top of the criminal aspect and the drug connections , we will lose ground in halting the spread of these terrorist organizations , " warns Gen. James Jones , head of the U.S. European Command , who has watched the rise in terrorist rackets with mounting concern . " You have to have much greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the early ' 90s , American cops , spies , and soldiers did come together on a common target of crime and terrorism  --  Pablo Escobar and his Medellin cocaine cartel . Escobar 's killers were blamed for the murder of hundreds of Colombian officials and the bombing of an Avianca airliner that killed 110 . To get Escobar , firewalls between agencies came down , information was shared , and money and people were focused on destroying one of the world 's most powerful crime syndicates . During the 1990s , transnational crime continued to be seen as a national security priority , but it fell off the map after 9/11 . Until January of this year , the federal government 's chief interagency committee on organized crime had n't even met for three years . The intelligence community 's reporting on the area , although boosted in the past year , remains a near-bottom priority . One knowledgeable source called the quality of work overseas on crime " sorely lacking " and said the best material comes from other governments . Domestically , meanwhile , years of neglect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the agency without much useful information in its files . " Everyone thinks we 've got huge databases with all our materials on organized crime , " says one veteran . " We 've got nothing close . " <p> Still , the growing criminal inroads by terrorist groups have raised alarms among a handful of tough-minded policymakers in Washington , and they are pushing for change . The National Security Council has begun work on a new policy on transnational crime that promises to make the crime-terrorism connection a top priority . The CIA 's Crime and Narcotics Center is spearheading the work of a dozen agencies in revamping the government 's overall assessment of international crime ; their report , with special attention to the nexus with terrorism , is scheduled for release early next year . One program that has caught U.S. attention is underway in Great Britain , where London 's Metropolitan Police now routinely monitor low-level criminal activity for ties to terrorism , checking over reports of fraud involving banks , credit cards , and travel documents . Similar work is being done by the feds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Immigration and Customs Enforcement has prioritized cracking rings smuggling people from high-risk countries , with good success . <p> " Draining the swamp . " In some ways , the deeper involvement by terrorists in traditional criminal activity may make it easier to track them . Criminal informants , who can be tempted with shortened prison time and money , are much easier to develop than the true believers who fill the ranks of terrorist groups . Acts of crime also attract attention and widen the chances that terrorists will make a mistake . Take , for example , a case uncovered this July , in which four men allegedly plotted to wage a jihad against some 20 targets in Southern California , including National Guard facilities , the Israeli Consulate , and several synagogues . Prosecutors said the planned attacks , led by the founder of a radical Islamic prison group , were being funded by a string of gas station robberies . The break in the case came not by an elite counterterrorist squad but by local cops who found a cellphone one of the robbers had lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on terrorism 's growing criminal rackets will not prove easy , however . " Draining the swamp , " as counterterrorism officials vow to do , may require more than even a seamless approach by intelligence and law enforcement can offer . Many of the worst groups owe their success to a pervasive criminality overseas , to failed states and no man 's lands from Central Asia to North Africa to South America , where the rule of law remains an abstract concept . In other places , it is the governments themselves that are the criminal enterprises , so mired in corruption that entire countries could be indicted under U.S. antiracketeering laws . Together , they help make up a criminal economy that , like a parallel universe , runs beneath the legitimate world of commerce . This global shadow economy  --  of dirty money , criminal enterprises , and black markets  --  has annual revenues of up to $2 trillion , according to U.N . estimates , larger than the gross domestic product of all but a handful of countries . Without its underground bankers , smuggling routes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simply could not exist . But taking on a worldwide plague of crime and corruption might be more than the public bargained for . " Ultimately , cracking down means trying to impose order where there 's instability , good governance where there 's corruption and crime , and economic growth where there 's poverty , " says the University of Pittsburgh 's Phil Williams , a consultant to the United Nations on crime and terrorism finance . " As long as the only routes of escape are violence and the black market , then organized crime and terrorism will endure as global problems .

From there , he continued to expand his operations across Asia . In the U.A.E. , Dawood 's men ran high-stakes gambling rings , fixed cricket matches , and threw lavish parties where Indian actors and sports stars mixed with Arab emirs .

The shift from gangster to terrorist came in 1993 , after rioting targeted Bombay 's Muslims . Bent on revenge , Dawood engineered the smuggling into India of tons of explosives provided by Pakistan 's spy agency , the Inter-Services Intelligence , say U.S. and Indian law enforcement . The bombings that followed made Dawood India 's most wanted man . The ISI then made Dawood an offer : If he relocated to Pakistan 's port city of Karachi and kept working with the ISI , it would guarantee him control of the nation 's coastal smuggling routes . For 12 years now , Dawood has called Pakistan home , where he is believed to own shopping malls , luxury homes , and shipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Europe .

He has allegedly met with al Qaeda leaders and even made a deal to share his smuggling routes with al Qaeda operatives . <p> Dawood has branded the allegations against him part of a years-long " smear campaign .

Forty years ago , Dubai was a backwater ; today , it hosts dozens of banks and one of the world 's busiest ports ; its free-trade zones are crammed with thousands of companies . Construction is everywhere  --  skyscrapers , malls , hotels , and , soon , the world 's tallest building . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a hub for smuggling , money laundering , and underground banking . There are Russian and Indian mobsters , Iranian arms traffickers , and Arab jihadists . Funds for the 9/11 hijackers and African embassy bombers were transferred through the city . It was the heart of Pakistani scientist A. Q. Khan 's black market in nuclear technology and other proliferation cases . Half of all applications to buy U.S. military equipment from Dubai are from bogus front companies , officials say . " Iran , " adds one U.S. official , " is building a bomb through Dubai . " Last year , U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents thwarted the shipment of 3,000 U.S. military night-vision goggles by an Iranian pair based in Dubai . Moving goods undetected is not hard . Dhows  --  rickety wooden boats that have plowed the Arabian Sea for centuries  --  move along the city center , uninspected , down the aptly named Smuggler 's Creek . <p> U.A.E. rulers have taken terrorism seriously since 9/11 , but Washington has a half-dozen extradition requests that they refuse to honor . The list includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the last fugitive of the BCCI banking scandal . The country has put money laundering controls on the books but has made few cases . Interior Minister Sheik Saif bin Zayed Al Nahyan told U.S. News the U.A.E. has made great strides in cracking down , but he insists that the real problems lie elsewhere . " We are a neutral country , like Switzerland , " he says . " Give us the evidence , and we will do something about it . Do n't blame others . " Not everyone agrees . " All roads lead to Dubai , " says former treasury agent John Cassara , author of Hide and Seek , a forthcoming book on terrorism finance . Cassara tried explaining U.S. concerns about Dubai to a local businessman but got only a puzzled look : " Mr. John , money laundering ? But that 's what we do . " David E.
