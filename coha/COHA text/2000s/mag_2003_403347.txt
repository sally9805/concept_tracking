We uncover what Faith Hill sees in her hot singing cowboy , Tim McGraw : He 's sexy ( check out that smile ) ; he 's talented ( his latest CD sold more than 2 million copies ) ; and he 's so in love , he can barely see straight ( " Of all the women in the world , she 's the only one who counts " ) . // The man in the black cowboy hat , white embroidered shirt , and tight blue jeans draws a few stares as he strides through the lobby of the Beverly Hills Hotel in California . This is not the usual guest attire at this posh establishment , but then again , this is n't their usual guest : The trim , six-foot , brown-eyed guy is Nashville 's star singer , Tim McGraw . Tim , who was born on May 1 , 1967 ( the same day Elvis married Priscilla , he 's proud to point out ) , may have sold 27 million CDs in the past decade and married country music 's reigning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no rock star . Last night Tim played a two-hour show and went straight back to the hotel so he could get up at 7 a.m. to help Faith get their three daughters ( Audrey , 1 ; Maggie , 5 ; and Gracie , 6 ) ready for a trip to Disneyland . He 's joining them there this afternoon , and then playing another concert nearby tonight . When you have three kids and two superstar careers to look after , scheduling is everything . But that does n't mean it all goes like clockwork . After taking a few photographs for Redbook , he realizes he 's left his wedding ring back in his hotel room . The platinum band set with three sizable diamonds , which Faith had made for him , is quickly fetched . The ring goes on and the hat comes off , ever so briefly , as Tim changes clothes , pulling a black T-shirt over his tanned biceps and flat stomach . An hour later , after singing a little and smiling a lot , the photos are done and Tim asks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the Beverly Hills Hotel 's famous bungalows with room for the whole family ; he and Faith have a rule never to be apart for more than three days . This is one tough rule to keep , given their extraordinarily busy careers . Tim 's already a best-selling author-This Is Ours , his scrapbook documenting the recording of his latest CD , Tim McGraw and the Dancehall Doctors , will be followed by a book on fatherhood . And he 'll soon make his acting debut playing a sheriff on a Navajo reservation in Black Cloud , a film written and directed by Rick Schroder . " I 'm looking forward to seeing if I suck or not , " Tim says with a laugh . The couple is determined to put family first and they 've been good about staying on track , but Tim does n't have such a grip on things this morning : He 's forgotten his key . " I 'll just sneak in the back , " he says , in that gravelly drawl of his . Tim 's morning may seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keys , etc. - but the last couple of years in his charmed life have also had plenty of drama . In December 2001 , Tim was out Christmas shopping , while Faith , who was seven months pregnant , was seeing her obstetrician . The doctor told Faith that she needed an emergency C-section ; Audrey , the couple 's third daughter , was born weighing just three pounds 11 ounces and spent three weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit . " All of the girls were a little early , so it was n't unexpected . But it was difficult when she was born and in the Isolette an incubator for preemies . We told the girls at home that Audrey was in no danger ; she just was n't ready to come home yet , " Tim has said . Today Audrey is a plump , happy baby . This past spring Tim had to deal with another family medical worry . His father , former major-league pitcher Frank " Tug " McGraw , underwent a six-hour procedure to remove a brain tumor . It 's been particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and stepfather . At age 11 , Tim accidentally discovered his birth certificate , which stated that Tug was his biological father ( more on that later ) . They finally got to know each other when Tim was 18 and subsequently developed a close relationship . Tug credits his son and Faith with getting him the help he needed . " I was told I had three weeks to live , " he said recently . " My son said , " This is unacceptable . " He and Faith got on their network and got me to someone who knew what they were talking about . " Today his prognosis is good . " He 's doing well , and I appreciate everybody 's concern , " Tim said . " But it 's something I 'd kind of like to keep private . " In these tough times , the couple have relied on their faith to pull them through . " Audrey 's birth just strengthened Faith 's belief in God and family , " Tim has said . Tim also relies on a great sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowing that women check him out and flash him when he plays onstage just cracks him up . " It 's flattering , " he admits . " But I do n't think they have a thing for me ; they have a thing for what I do when I 'm up there doing Elvis moves . I do n't walk around the house doing that . " Not that Faith would mind . The couple , famous for their sexual chemistry , often brag about making more babies . Lots more babies . " We definitely keep trying , " Faith told Larry King . " If we keep trying , " Tim chimed in with a chuckle , " we might go to 12 . " It 's evident that Tim 's a playful guy when , ready to sit down and share his thoughts with Redbook on love , Faith , and fatherhood , he shows up wearing a baseball cap with the logo of the movie Anger Management . What have you learned from being a father ? One thing you learn is anger management . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is how deep you can love . There 's just an endless , bottomless well of love there . And you learn to have more patience . I think the challenge for me is going to come as they get older and they discover boys . I think that 's where I 'm going to really figure out what kind of mettle I have . You have some time , though , is n't your oldest only six ? Yeah , well , she discovered boys a long time ago . She 's boy-crazy already . Boy bands , boy this , boy that-any boy right now . She 's going to kill me one day . Laughs They 're all flirts . Maggie 's quieter , but when she wants something , boy , look out ! I think Audrey is going to be the biggest flirt of all . She 's just a force of nature . How do you balance parenthood , marriage , and careers ? I think balance is the wrong word . That sort of suggests that there 's equality among work and life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a lot of things we do n't do that careerwise we probably should do , but it just does n't work out with the kids . There 've been a couple of big movies that Faith turned down because our family is the most important thing . Our family is happy , the kids are happy , and we 're tight . Everything else kind of finds its place , including work . If you make the right decisions in your life , then your life turns out well . I make a wrong one every now and then , but all parents make wrong decisions every now and then . It must help to have such a supportive wife . Faith is just the best . When I met her , she changed my life . I was never real wild , but I had fun for a long time when I was young and single . And probably went a little too far down the wrong path a couple of times . Faith straightened all that out for me . Pretty much in record time , right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date . I knew right away . It took me a while to convince her , but I knew right away . How did you know she was The One ? The simple way to say it is this : I do n't care who you are , male , female , or whatever , you ca n't be in the same room as Faith and have a conversation with her without falling in love . You look at her and she 's so intimidatingly beautiful and smart , but when you talk to her , you realize she 's just the girl next door from Mississippi . When we met each other , we felt like we came from the same neighborhood . And essentially , we did . We grew up 100 miles from each other . We felt like we were the same kind of people . We wanted the same things out of life , too . We have the same goals and ambitions . It 's weird . We both really work hard and enjoy our careers , but I do n't think that there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of family things . How do you and Faith split the family responsibilities ? We do n't really split them ; we do them as a team . Whatever hole happens to be open at the time , we jump in and fill it . What romantic things do you do for Faith ? I like to write her notes every now and then . I bake dinner for her , and we try to go to dinner together . But date nights are pretty rare when you have three kids and two busy careers . I try to hold up my end of the bargain on that deal . Well , all those things sound romantic . Have you ever had a failed attempt ? I think I missed a Mother 's Day one time in the middle of a tour . I did n't miss the day-just the gift . But she did n't care . She 's cool . Does she do romantic things for you ? Well , she takes care of me . I mean , she 's my best friend in life . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , energy , and artistic vision she puts into what she does and how great she does it . And she does ten times that for our family . To me , that-on top of everything else she does-is the perfect thing . You like to cook . What 's your specialty ? My favorite is pasta with spaghetti sauce . My mother was a D'Agostino , so I have a little Italian in my blood . I think pasta is probably my best thing-only I 'm not giving away the recipe ! Do you cook most of the time ? A lot . Faith likes to cook too , but if she 's watching the kids , I 'll cook . We 're both so busy that sometimes we have someone cook for us , but we like to cook ourselves , though . Do you always drive the girls to school ? That 's my favorite time . We listen to the radio and talk about music and stuff-dad-daughter things . You know , like " Daddy , why is the sky blue ? What does that sign say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a house in Nashville that we 've lived in for four years now , and a farm outside of Nashville that 's 800 acres . It 's beautiful . It 's got a farmhouse that was built in 1843 , I believe , and another house that was built in the 1840s . It 's got two or three old houses on the property , and we 're getting ready to move into the design phase of a new one . How do you spend your downtime ? We really like to be home . And in summertime , hang out by the pool with the kids and grill hamburgers . And we like to go to the farm and the cabin . In the wintertime , we like to build a fire in the cabin and stay up there for three or four days at a time . We get out the four-wheelers and look at the deer and the turkey . We also have a pond out there , so we fish . Being celebrities , is it hard to live a quiet life there ? People in Nashville @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the mall and take the kids to the zoo , people see us and they say hi . It 's actually more of a problem at our house to go out in the yard because of fans coming to the gate . What TV show would you like to guest-star on ? I like Everybody Loves Raymond , but I think I 'd go for Will &; Grace . I could play Will 's love interest . That 'd be ... interesting . Faith has said that when you two go antique shopping , you sometimes leave the shop when she 's haggling ? Oh , yeah . I get so embarrassed . She 's very good at it . When I see something I like , I just pay what it costs . Maybe that has something to do with your childhood . What was it like growing up in Start , Louisiana ? Start is slow . It 's in the northeastern part of Louisiana . It 's a very rural area . I grew up right in the middle of a huge swamp . We were very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had food stamps . Your mom was quite young when she met Tug and had you , was n't she ? It was a spring-training incident in Jacksonville , Florida , where she grew up . Her mom 's family was all in Louisiana , so when she got pregnant , they shipped her off there-to the country , away from everybody . I was born in this little farm town . My mom worked at a cafe at the Trailways bus station ; I stayed in the playpen there . My future stepdad used to come in all the time , and they ended up getting married . And what happened when you found out about Tug ? I was looking for Christmas gifts in my mother 's closet when I ran across my birth certificate . It was more traumatic for everybody around me than it was for me . It was weird . It was n't like he Tug embraced me at that point . I was 11 years old , and he was in the middle of his career . We met once , and then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ older you get , the more those things dig at you . But for the past 18 , 19 years , I 've built a good relationship with Tug , although going through his cancer operation put a twist on things . When did you learn about the facts of life ? Pretty young . Out in the country , there was n't much else to do . Do you remember your first kiss ? I sure do . Her name was Renee , and I think we were on a church outing . I 'm sure she went on to better things ; I did n't know much about kissing back then . Did you lose your virginity in the backseat of a car , like in your hit song " Red Ragtop , " about sexual awakening ? I did nt have a car . Laughs I think it was at a hayride . And I was probably younger than I should 've been . How do you mend a broken heart ? Faith . If you were going to treat Faith to a lap dance , what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dancer . Laughs My daughters will put on Destiny 's Child , and sometimes I 'll boogie with them . But if I were giving Faith a lap dance , I would probably put on " The Joker . " It really would n't matter what the song was , because she 'd be laughing . Sidebar " My fans do n't have a thing for me , they have a thing for what I do . " Sidebar " If I were giving Faith a lap dance ... she 'd be laughing . " // <p>
