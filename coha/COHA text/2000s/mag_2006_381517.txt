Unapologetically conservative and unfailingly provocative , Pat Buchanan has been firing from the right for most of the past four decades . In his new book , State of Emergency  --  out this week  --  the politician and omnipresent pundit confronts what he calls the immigrant " invasion and conquest of America . " Buchanan , 67 , talked with TIME 's Jeff Chu about American identity , why conservatives will lose the culture wars and the rewards of being a cat lover . <P> The U.S. is in a state of emergency ? <P> If we do not get control of our borders and stop this greatest invasion in history , I see the dissolution of the U.S. and the loss of the American Southwest  --  culturally and linguistically , not politically  --  to Mexico . It could become a part of Mexico in the way that Kosovo is now a part of Albania . <P> You liken the immigrant wave to the Visigoths who sacked Rome . Is that fair ? <P> I 'm predicting that America will no longer be one nation but more like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held together by a regime . The country I grew up in was culturally united , even if it was racially divided . We spoke the same language , had the same faith , laughed at the same comedians . We were one nationality . We 're ceasing to be that when you have hundreds of thousands of people who want to retain their own culture , their own language , their own loyalty . What do we have in common that makes us fellow Americans ? Is it simply citizenship ? Or is it blood , soil , history and heroes ? <P> Your ' 92 Republican Convention speech put another culture war on the agenda . Who 's winning ? <P> It 's not a battle of right and left but right and wrong . What do we believe about abortion ? What do we believe about gay rights ? The left has triumphed in seizing the heights of culture  --  the media , Hollywood , the academic community  --  and it 's fiercely competitive in the political realm . I do n't think someone of Bill Clinton 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And we would n't be debating gay marriage in the 1970s . People would have said , " Are you insane ? " <P> Do you think legal gay marriage is inevitable ? <P> Traditionalists still have the upper hand , but there 's no doubt which way the trend is going . And it is not going the conservative way . <P> Can conservatives win the culture wars ? <P> Those of us on the right have been losing ground since the 1970s and ' 80s . Can we ultimately win ? I think you would need a reconversion of the country to a traditionalist , Christian point of view  --  and I do n't see that coming . <P> You ran for President three times , most recently in 2000 . Will you again ? <P> The American people have spoken on that issue . But I loved campaigning . Everywhere you go , people are saying , " Go , Pat , go ! " It 's like the NFL play-offs , and you 're captain of one of the teams . But as British politician Enoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failure . " <P> How would you rate President Bush ? <P> On some things  --  the Supreme Court , tax cuts  --  I give him an A-plus . On foreign policy , I give him an incomplete . If it does n't improve , it 's going to be failure . I do n't believe interventionism is the way to deal with rising Islamic revolution . We 're seen in the Middle East as an imperial power propping up corrupt regimes and giving Israel the wherewithal to do what they did to Lebanon . The President is widely reviled.
