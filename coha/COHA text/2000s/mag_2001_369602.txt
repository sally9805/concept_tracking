Tuesdays with Morrie , the moving story of a teacher , his wisdom and his death , has more than 5 million copies in print in 31 languages . TIME talked with the author in New York City <P> Q. Your book has been a smash hit for three years . Has it been enjoyable for you ? <P> A. I do n't know if enjoyable is the word I would use . I 've had an enlightening time . I 've had a life-changing time . I 'm a much different person now than I was before this book came out . <P> Q. What 's it like to meet the public ? <P> A. People who meet me who have read the book feel that they have a personal connection to me  --  to tell me their woes , their illnesses , the people they have lost in their life . Or they want to know more about some of the wisdom that Morrie had . Sometimes they mistake me for Morrie . They 'll call me Morrie . They 'll hold me to extremely high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to clerical types of standards sometimes . And I never was that good a person . I would like to aspire to be , but sometimes I have to remind people that I was the guy sitting on the other side of the bed . Morrie was the wise old man ; I was trying to learn from him . <P> Q. In what ways have you changed ? <P> A. I certainly have become more patient with people . I 've become better at listening to people 's sad stories , and maybe even having something to say that 's of some value . When I first began , I was overwhelmed . I was hearing about so many people dying . I did n't know what to say . I would just listen and say " I 'm sorry , " and then feel inadequate . But a lot of times , I 've learned , what people really want is somebody to talk to . They want to know that somebody else has gone through it . They want to know that there 's a little light at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Q. What 's wrong with our attitudes about older people ? <P> A. When Morrie was at his weakest and his most helpless , that 's when he had the most to offer . But there were people who came to visit him , and he needed help urinating . He could n't even get up . So he 'd say , Will you hold the beaker ? And they 'd freak out . Maybe they 'd do it or maybe they 'd say no , but they would n't come back . Instead of seeing him as a guy who was facing death and had all this wisdom , it would be , He 's the guy I have to hold the beaker for . Well , you 're missing out on a great thing there . You guys have got to get past what you think is disgusting and what you think you ca n't do . I 'm not sure how capable our generation is going to be . A lot of us are way too selfish to do that . But we 're going to face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think Tuesdays with Morrie has been so successful ? <P> A. I roll it around in my head . We all lose somebody we care about and want to find some comforting way of dealing with it , something that will give us a little closure , a little peace . When Morrie says , " Death ends a life , but not a relationship , " that 's the thing that comes back over and over . We say , " That 's what I 've been looking for . " <P> Q. Will you write more about Morrie ?
