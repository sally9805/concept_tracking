Just as there are two types of families , sad and happy ones , there are two types of radio talk shows , strident and chatty ones . The Satellite Sisters belong in the latter category in both instances . Five sisters ( Julie , 46 , Liz , 44 , Sheila , 43 , Monica , 42 , and Lian , 36 ) , or half the entire Dolan family , they can be heard cheerfully chewing the fat every week on public radio . <P> They dip into such topics as credit card debt , cardiac health and the hazards of transporting a gravy boat to a foreign clime . Their talk is not polemical , deep or even outrageously funny . It 's just comfy , lively chat , the kind you 'd expect from sisters whose lives are quite different  --  a single career woman , a divorce , a wife who has followed her husband to Thailand and dials into the conversation via a satellite uplink ( hence the name )  --  and yet who share an effortless , chip-proof familiarity . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few men , who can identify with at least one of them , Satellite Sisters has become a surprise hit , currently airing in 70 markets , up from 19 in 2000 . <P> Now the Dolan sisters  --  who seem to want to supplant the McCourt brothers in ubiquity  --  have released a book , Satellite Sisters ' UnCommon Senses ( Riverhead ; 370 pages ; $24.95 ) . It posits , through a series of anecdotes told by each sister , that when you grow up in a large family , you develop an extra set of senses that help you both stand out from and connect to your kin . This , at least , is the conceit . But the underlying mantra of the book and the radio show is the same : talk is good . Even seemingly insignificant banter , such as the discussion about the aforementioned gravy boat , is really a way of coping with big life changes , such as Julie 's move to Bangkok . " Everyone uses conversation with people to help them make big decisions , " says Liz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the idea for the show . " I 'd always wondered why there was n't more on the radio that sounded like the way people really talk . " This is reality radio , and it 's much more intimate and personal than its brash TV sibling . <P> But does it work in book form ? The Dolans believe that the most underexplored love story is the bond between siblings . And their book certainly communicates plenty of affection amid the joys and indignities of life in a large family . But without the interaction of the radio show , it comes off as stilted and slight . Good radio inhabits the background ; we can do something else while listening . But good books demand all our attention . This one does n't hold it . <P>  --  By Belinda Luscombe
