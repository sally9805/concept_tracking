Chapter One LINDA TATE had always been terrified of heights , although she was far too proud and stubborn to admit it . She wished now she 'd babbled it out to whoever would listen . It might have saved her from this . Knees quivering and adrenaline pumping , she clung to the sides of the open hatch in the Twin Otter , high above the earth . Her heart felt as if it was about to come crashing out of her chest as she listened to a final briefing from her spotter , who was pointing way down at the tiny plastic orange panel that marked where she was supposed to land . Except that she knew she was going to die instead . She only hoped that her treasured digital video camera and the incredible shots she was about to get would survive . She 'd been too scared to eat anything , so at least her body would n't be covered with vomit . If there was anything left of her body when this was over . As a television news photographer for KBTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flipped a kayak while riding down a white-water canyon , been knocked cold and dragged through icy snow by manic sled dogs and gotten bucked off a horse at a famous dude ranch . Linda had come through every catastrophe smiling , albeit grimly at times , with film coverage that had won her severalawards . Sure , they were for best comedic news coverage , but they were recognition all the same . That was before she 'd enrolled in Rookie Training for Smoke Jumpers . " You two do n't have to go through the whole thing , but in order to tag along with a smoke jumping crew , you have to know the basics and be fit , " her producer had assured her and Jacob Gibson , the reporter whom Linda accompanied on assignments . " You have to be trained as jumpers - we want the view from on high . " So ten days ago , she and Jacob had arrived here in Redding , the California training base for smoke jumpers . Even though they did n't have to , Linda had considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualification test - running a mile and a half in eleven minutes , then doing 25 push-ups , 7 pull-ups , and 45 sit-ups . Jacob had flunked on the running part , but further down the line he 'd proved to be gifted at tree climbing . Go figure . And he was also acing this final jump test , damn his hide . He 'd launched himself out of the door moments before . His chute was floating downward with him attached , and she absolutely had to photograph this portion of the training for the feature . But was her job worth this ? Ending up thousands of feet above the ground , with a lunatic at her side shouting , " On final , " and then - please God do n't let me die - " Get ready . " She felt the sharp slap on her shoulder that meant go for it . She screamed as she let go , and suddenly her feet were over her head , aiming up into the blue California sky , and she was falling - one second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a miraculous snap , the blessed parachute deployed , a patriotic red , white and blue curve above her , and sky and earth rocked before coming into focus . The world went profoundly silent . Dazed , Linda gulped in air , glimpsed Jacob over to her left and down , waving up at her and laughing , and belatedly she remembered her camera . She snapped off shot after shot of him and the other jumpers as she floated down , and she was actually laughing herself as the earth approached , which was probably why she forgot to turn into the wind , the way she 'd been taught , before she hit the ground . Instead of a graceful landing , the wind caught her and she found herself sprinting like a demented track star for about a hundred yards , plowing up a final furrow of dirt and grass for another thirty before she frantically braced her feet and did a full face plant . She lay still , ears ringing , tongue smarting where she 'd bitten it . She swallowed blood and cursed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only used in extreme distress . The only positive thing she could think of was that she 'd worn contact lenses and not her glasses . They 'd have gotten smashed for sure . " You okay , Lindy Lou ? " The worried voice belonged to Jacob . He was puffing . She 'd missed the patch by a long shot , and even after a week of daily torturous five-mile training jaunts , he still could n't run worth a damn . " No , I 'm not okay . " She was furious , and she was also lisping because of her tongue . " There 's dirt down my neck , and my hands are all scraped . " Linda sat up and rubbed sand out of her eyes , stripped off her gloves and , hands shaking , struggled with the snaps and buckles of her chute . " That 's it ? Nothing broken ? " Jacob was kneeling on one side of her , and a medic was on the other . Ten of the rookies from the smoke jumping course were now ringed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Stop poking at me , I 'm fine . " She was royally pissed off at herself . And she was n't the only one . " Tate . " The trainer now stood over her , arms akimbo , fierce scowl in place , voice raised to a dull roar . " What the hell did you think you were doing ? You missed the patch by half a mile , and goddamn it , how many times did I stress turning into the wind on landing ? And instead of taking goddamn pictures , did it dawn on you that you were supposed to be manipulating your goddamn chute ? " " Yes sir , sorry sir . " She struggled to her feet and got rid of the chute , and the assembly gave a ragged cheer . She managed a grin and a wave in spite of the pain in her right ankle . Although there were a small number of qualified female smoke jumpers in the U.S. , she was the only woman in this training group . Linda had vowed to prove that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Well , she 'd flunked the easy part . ( Continues ... )
