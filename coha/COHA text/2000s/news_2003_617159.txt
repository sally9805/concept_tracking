<p> Baghdad , Iraq  --  Bechtel Corp . built the Hoover Dam and the English Channel Tunnel , but Iraqi Principal Yakob Yusef al-Yakobi wonders why it ca n't keep the new fluorescent lights from falling off his high school 's ceilings . <p> The gap under his new office door is so big he has nailed a board across the bottom to keep out the stray kittens that had been crawling underneath it for shelter . <p> The principal and his staff also say that Bechtel 's Iraqi subcontractors replaced usable floor tiles and 32 ceiling fans  --  school property  --  and sold them off , leaving behind lower-quality replacements . <p> " They just wanted to finish their work very quickly , " al-Yakobi said . " We trust Bechtel , but it was very bad to give contracts to Iraqi contractors . " <p> President Bush and other U.S. officials tout the repairs to Iraq 's schools as a hallmark of an American-led renewal , a symbol of hope for a new generation of Iraqis . But for many in Baghdad , including some U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears slipshod and wasteful . <p> One frustrated American , Maj. Linda Scharf , a civil affairs officer , ordered a survey of 20 Bechtel-repaired schools in her area . She found dangerous debris left in playgrounds , sloppy paint jobs and broken toilets . <p> " The work was horrible , " she said . <p> Iraqi Minister of Education Ala'din Alwan blamed many of the problems on the chaos that reigned in Iraq when Bechtel began work . He said that a recent agreement with the U.S.-led Coalition Provisional Authority would ensure that complaints about the schools were addressed and that his government ministry , left out of initial planning , would set the priorities . He also said that Bechtel did not coordinate its work with his ministry . <p> " The Ministry of Education had either no role or a very small role , " said Alwan , who took on his job in September . " We are starting to work on the problems . Now we are starting to take over . " <p> The renovation of Iraqi schools , the majority of which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by myriad groups , including the U.S. Army and agencies under contract to the U.S. Agency for International Development . <p> Those involved admit there have been duplicated efforts at some schools , while others have gone untouched . The groups now meet regularly to " deconflict " their efforts . <p> Bechtel 's part of the job , under USAID contract , was enormous  --  refurbishing 1,239 schools in three months . <p> GIs , Iraqis complain <p> The school refurbishment project is worth about $50 million to Bechtel , part of more than $1 billion in contracts the government awarded the San Francisco-based company for work in Iraq . The intimacy and delicacy of renovating schools has been a vexing and emotional experience for the company , whose forte is big projects like power plants . <p> The task given Bechtel by USAID was to provide a " quick fix " in preparing for a school year that began Oct. 3 . Company officials stress the size of the job and the fact that most Iraqi government or commercial agencies were not functioning when it began . <p> Responding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every school , and they promise to address all the problems under a one-year warranty . <p> " The people at Bechtel really care about this one . We 've all got kids . We 've all been to school , " said Bechtel 's Gregory Huger , a manager in the reconstruction program . <p> " In a country with a lot of hurt , this is meaningful . So it 's a system , it 's people , who care , and it 's being done in the middle of chaos , chaos evolving into something more orderly and more Iraqi . " <p> USAID officials defend Bechtel , saying that complaints from the Ministry of Education have shown only about 2 percent of Bechtel 's schools substandard . Some Iraqis appreciate the job Bechtel has done as well . <p> But ministry officials say the 2 percent is just an initial sampling of problems . In a ministry report , comments from Army personnel , Iraqi Education Ministry staff and school principals often are severe . <p> " The new fans are cheap and burned out immediately upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. soldier wrote in an inspection . <p> " Lousy paint job . Major clean-up work required . Bathrooms in poor condition , " another wrote about a different school . <p> Much of the criticism focuses on Bechtel 's Iraqi subcontractors . " The contractor has demanded the school managers to hand over the good and broken furniture . The names of the subcontractors are unknown to us because they did not come to our office , " an Iraqi school planner wrote . <p> Missing equipment and furniture was a frequent complaint . Neither the Iraqi Ministry of Education nor UNICEF , the United Nation 's child advocacy agency , another organization working on schools , allows subcontractors to take old equipment . Sometimes the ministry puts it up for auction to raise money . But Bechtel and , in some cases , Army subcontractors were allowed to take old equipment without ministry approval , ministry officials noted . <p> Bechtel officials said the subcontractors supplied receipts for any items taken and that in some schools  --  including al-Yakobi 's  --  items already were stolen before Bechtel arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School construction is often contentious , even in America . In Iraq , misunderstandings and Iraqis ' inflated expectations about what Bechtel was supposed to do have resulted in bruised feelings on both sides . <p> Iraqi school administrators and teachers feel disrespected yet again after years of neglect under Saddam Hussein 's regime . Bechtel workers , so affected by the condition of the schools that they began organizing a volunteer drive in America soliciting donations of school supplies , are clearly stung by the criticism . <p> Some Iraqis express a mixture of gratitude and helpless frustration at Bechtel 's efforts . <p> Principal al-Yakobi signed a contractor 's letter accepting the work at his Utaiyfiyya high school , he said , because he liked the paint job and the contractor agreed to correct his mistakes . Given the extremely dilapidated condition of Iraq 's schools , a new coat of paint was a morale boost , even if it did come with heavy splatter on windows and floors . <p> Confounding all parties from the start was the sad state of Iraq 's schools . <p> Some Iraqis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than half of the country 's 14,000 schools have no potable water and no working toilets . The roofs leak , the grounds flood with backed-up sewage and even basic appliances  --  like photocopying machines or multiline telephones  --  are absent from most . <p> Yet despite the war and the collapse of their government , Iraqis continued the school year last spring , finishing classes and their standardized exams . Then Bechtel and a few nongovernmental organizations stepped in , with USAID backing , to spruce up the schools for the fall . <p> Bechtel has its supporters . Some principals were satisfied . Their schools at least have a new coat of paint and water fountains , an air conditioner for the office and some new tile work . As Bechtel notes , many of the complaints were about work that was not in its mission  --  long-term jobs like sewage and groundskeeping . <p> But education officials say there were basic flaws in Bechtel 's approach . Subcontractors were unknown to the ministry and had less oversight than they would have had under the ministry or major aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to guarantee their work , and Bechtel paid their insurance . Bechtel officials noted that when the work began , banks and insurance companies were not functioning . <p> There are still signs of confusion amid groups working on the schools . <p> At a weekly meeting , representatives of the Coalition Provisional Authority , the Army , the Ministry of Education and aid groups try to decide which schools need help and who can take them on . They want to avoid duplicating efforts . <p> At a meeting last week , one aid worker told the gathering that USAID had ordered all groups to stay out of Bechtel 's schools until the firm 's work could be assessed . <p> USAID officials , not at the meeting , said later that was not true . <p> Those at the meeting groused that Bechtel does not attend the meetings . Bechtel officials said they did not know about the sessions.
