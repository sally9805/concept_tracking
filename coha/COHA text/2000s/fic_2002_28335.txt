HOORAY FOR HOLLYWOOD . Brass stars with celebrities ' names were inlaid in the sidewalk but the stars of the night were toxin merchants , strong-arm specialists , and fifteen-year-olds running from family values turned vicious . Open twenty-four hours a day , Go-Ji 's welcomed them all . The coffee shop sat on the north side of Hollywood Boulevard , east of Vine , between a tattoo parlor and a thrash-metal bar . At 3:00 A.M. , a Mexican boy was sweeping the sidewalk when Nolan Dahl pulled his cruiser into the front loading zone . The boy lacked documentation but the sight of the policeman did n't alter his rhythm ; cops could care less about inmigration . From what the boy had observed after a month , no one in L.A. cared much about anything . Nolan Dahl locked the black-and-white and entered the restaurant , sauntering the way only 220 pounds of young , muscular cop laden with baton , belt , radio , flashlight , and holstered nine-millimeter could saunter . The place smelled rancid and the aisle of deep red carpet between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settled at the rear , allowing himself a view of the Filipino cashier . The next booth was occupied by a twenty-three-year-old pimp from Compton named Terrell Cochrane and one of his employees , a chubby sixteen-year-old mother of two named Germadine Batts , formerly of Checkpoint , Oklahoma . Fifteen minutes ago , the two had sat around the corner in Terrell 's white Lexus , where Germadine had rolled up a blue , spangled legging and shot fifteen dollars ' worth of tar heroin into a faltering ankle vein . Now nicely numbed and hypoglycemic , she was on her second diluted jumbo Coke , sucking ice and fooling with the pink plastic stirrer . Terrell had mixed heroin and cocaine into a speedball and was feeling as perfectly balanced as a tightrope walker . He slouched , forked holes in his cheeseburger , simulated the Olympic logo with five flaccid onion rings while pretending not to watch the big blond cop . Nolan Dahl could n't have cared less about either of them , or the five other things scattered around the bright room . Elevator rock played @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ molasses hurried down the aisle and stopped at Nolan 's booth , smiling . Nolan smiled back , waved away a menu , and asked for coconut cream pie and coffee , please . " New on the night shift ? " asked the waitress . She 'd come from Ethiopia five years ago and spoke beautiful English with a pleasant accent . Nolan smiled again and shook his head . He 'd been working Hollywood night shift for three months but had never patronized Go-Ji 's , getting his sugar rush from a Dunkin ' on Highland recommended by Wes Baker . Cops and doughnuts . Big joke . " Never seen you before , Officer -- Dahl . " " Well , " he said , " life 's full of new experiences . " The waitress laughed . " Well , hmm . " She left for the pastry counter and Nolan watched her before shifting his blue eyes , making contact with Terrell Cochrane . Scruffy thing . Nolan Dahl was twenty-seven and had been formed , to a large extent , by TV . Before joining the force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big hats with feathers . Soon he 'd learned you could n't prepare for anything . Anything . He scanned Terrell and the hooker , who had to be a minor . This month the pimp was into coarse , oversized , insipid plaid shirts over black T-shirts , abbreviated cornrows above shaved temples . Last month had been black leather ; before that , African prince . The cop 's stare bothered Terrell . Hoping it was someone else under scrutiny , he looked across the aisle at the three transsexuals giggling and whispering and making a big deal out of eating french fries . He eased back to the cop . The cop was smiling at him . A weird smile -- almost sad . What did that mean ? Terrell returned to his burger , feeling a little out of balance . The Ethiopian waitress brought Nolan 's order and watched as he tasted a forkful of pie . " Good , " he said , though the coconut tasted like bad pina-colada mix and the cream was gluey . He was a practiced culinary liar . As a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " Delish , " along with Helena and Dad . " Anything else , Officer Dahl ? " " Not for now , thanks . " Nothing you 've got . " Okay , just let me know . " Nolan smiled again and she left . Terrell Cochrane thought , That smile -- one happy fucker . No reason for a cop to be happy ' ceptin ' he busted some rodney with no video going . Nolan ate more pie and again aimed his smile at Terrell . Then he shrugged . The pimp looked sideways at Germadine , by now nodding half-comatose into her Coke . Few minutes more , bitch , then back outside for more gravel-knee . The cop ate the rest of the pie , finished his coffee and his water , and the waitress was there right away with refills . Bitch . After bringing Terrell 's and Germadine 's food , she 'd mostly ignored them . Terrell lifted his burger and watched her say something to the cop . The cop just kept smiling and shaking his head . The bitch gave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she turned all grinny . A twenty , keep it , was the reason . Fuckers always tipped big , but this ? All that smiling , must be celebrating something . The cop looked into his empty coffee cup . Then something came out from under the table . His gun . He was smiling at Terrell again . Showing him the gun ! The cop 's arm stretched . Terrell 's bowels gave way as he ducked under the table , not bothering to push down on Germadine 's head though he 'd had plenty of practice doing that . The other patrons saw Terrell 's dive . The transsexuals and the drunken long-haul truck driver behind them and the toothless , senile , ninety-year-old man in the first booth . Everyone ducked . Except the Ethiopian waitress , who 'd been talking to the Filipino cashier . She stared , too terrified to move . Nolan Dahl nodded at the waitress . Smiled . She thought , A sad smile , what 's with this guy ? Nolan closed his eyes , almost as if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lips and , sucking like a baby , fixed his gaze on the waitress 's pretty face . She was still unable to move . He saw her terror , softened his eyes , trying to let her know it was okay , the only way . A beautiful , black , final image . God this place smelled crappy . He pulled the trigger . CHAPTER TWO HELENA DAHL GAVE ME A MOURNER 'S ACCOUNT . THE rest I got from the papers and from Milo . The young cop 's suicide merited only two inches on page 23 with no follow-up . But the flash-point violence stayed with me and when Milo called a few weeks later and asked me to see Helena , I said , " That one . Any idea yet why he did it ? " " Nope . That 's probably what she wants to talk about . Rick says do n't feel obligated , Alex . She 's a nurse at Cedars , worked with him in the E.R. and does n't want to see the in-house shrinks . But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Has the department done its own investigation ? " " Probably . " " You have n't heard anything ? " " Those kinds of things are kept quiet and I 'm not exactly in the loop . Only thing I 've heard is the kid was different . Quiet , stuck to himself , read books . " " Books , " I said . " Well , there 's a motive for you . " He laughed . " Guns do n't kill , introspection does ? " I laughed back . But I thought about that . Helena Dahl called me that evening and I arranged to see her in my home office the following morning . She arrived precisely on time , a tall , handsome woman of thirty , with very short straight blond hair and sinewy arms exposed by a navy blue tank top . The tank was tucked into jeans and she wore tennies without socks . Her face was a lean oval , well-sunned , her eyes light blue , her mouth exceptionally wide . No jewelry . No wedding ring . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thanked me for seeing her , then followed me . The new house is set up for therapy . I take patients in through a side door , crossing the Japanese garden and passing the fish pond . People usually stop to look at the koi or at least comment but she did n't . Inside she sat very straight with her hands on her knees . Most of my work involves children caught up in the court system and a portion of the office is set aside for play therapy . She did n't look at the toys . " This is the first time I 've done this . " Her voice was soft and low but it carried some authority . An E.R. nurse would make good use of that . " Even after my divorce , I never talked to anyone , " she added . " I really do n't know what I expect . " " Maybe to make some sense of it ? " I said gently . " You think that 's possible ? " " You may be able to learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Well , at least you 're honest . Shall we get right into it ? " " If you 're ready --  " " I do n't know what I am but why waste time ? It 's ... you know about the basic details ? " I nodded . " There was really no warning , Dr. Delaware . He was such a ... " Then she cried . Then she spilled it out . " NOLAN WAS SMART , SHE SAID . " I MEAN SERIOUSLY smart , brilliant . So the last thing you 'd think he 'd end up being was a cop -- no offense to Rick 's friend , but that 's not exactly what comes to mind when you think intellectual , right ? " Milo had a master 's degree in literature . I said , " So Nolan was an intellectual . " " Definitely . " " How much education did he have ? " " Two years of college . Cal State Northridge . Psychology major , as a matter of fact . " " He did n't finish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was rebellion -- our parents were heavily into education . Maybe he just got sick of classes , I do n't know . I 'm three years older , was already working by the time he dropped out . No one expected him to join the police . The only thing I can think of is he 'd gotten politically conservative , real law-and-order . But still ... the other thing is , he always loved ... sleaze . " " Sleaze ? " " Spooky stuff , the dark side of things . As a kid he was always into horror movies , really gross stuff , the grossest . His senior year in high school , he went through a stage where he grew his hair long and listened to heavy metal and pierced his ears five times . My parents were convinced he was into satanism or something . " " Was he ? " " Who knows ? But you know parents . " " Did they hassle him ? " " No , that was n't their style . They just rode it out . " " Tolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted --  " She cut the sentence short . " Where 'd you grow up ? " I said . " The Valley . Woodland Hills . My father was an engineer , worked at Lockheed , passed away five years ago . My mother was a social worker but never worked . She 's gone , too . A stroke , a year after Dad died . She had hypertension , never took care of it . She was only sixty . But maybe she 's the lucky one -- not having to know what Nolan did . " Her hands balled . " Any other family ? " I said . " No , just Nolan and me . He never married and I 'm divorced . No kids . My ex is a doctor . " She smiled . " Big surprise . Gary 's a pulmonologist , basically a nice guy . But he decided he wanted to be a farmer so he moved to North Carolina . " " You did n't want to be a farmer ? " " Not really . But even if I did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the floor . " So you 're bearing all this alone , " I said . " Yup . Where was I -- oh , the satanic nonsense . No big deal , it did n't last long and then Nolan got back to normal teenage stuff . School , sports , girls , his car . " " Did he maintain his taste for the dark side ? " " Probably not -- I do n't know why I brought that up . What do you think about the way Nolan did it ? " " Using his service gun ? " She winced . " I meant so publically , in front of all those people . Like saying screw you to the world . " " Maybe that was his message . " " I thought it was theatrical , " she said , as if she had n't heard . " Was he a theatrical person ? " " Hard to say . He was very good-looking , big , made an impression -- the kind of guy you noticed when he entered a room . Did he milk that ? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adult ? The truth is , Dr. Delaware , Nolan and I lost touch . We were never close . And now --  " More tears . " As a little kid he always enjoyed being the center of attention . But other times he did n't want anything to do with anybody , just crawled into his own little space . " " Moody ? " " A family trait . " She rubbed her knees and looked past me . " My dad underwent shock therapy for depression when Nolan and I were in grade school . We were never told what was going on , just that he was going into the hospital for a couple of days . But after he died , Mom told us . " " How many treatments did he have ? " " I do n't know , three , maybe four . When he 'd come home he 'd be wiped out , fuzzy about remembering -- like what you see in head-injury patients . They say ECT works better now but I 'm sure it damaged his brain . He faded in middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to Mozart . " " He must have been severely depressed to get ECT , " I said . " Must have been but I never really saw it . He was quiet , sweet , shy . " " What was his relationship with Nolan ? " " There was n't much of one that I could see . Even though Nolan was gifted , he was into typical macho stuff . Sports , surfing , cars . Dad 's idea of recreation was ... " she smiled --  " reading and listening to Mozart . " " Dad never had conflict with anyone . " " How did Nolan react to your father 's death ? " " He cried at the funeral . Afterward , we both tried to comfort Mom for a while , then he just drifted away again . " She pinched her lower lip . " I did n't want Nolan to have one of those big LAPD funerals , gun salutes , all that crap . No one at the department argued . Like they were happy not to deal with it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all his stuff is mine . Dad 's and Mom 's stuff , too . I 'm the survivor . " Too much pain . I backtracked . " What was your mother like ? " " More outgoing than Dad . Not moody . On the contrary , she was always up , cheerful , optimistic . Probably why she stroked out -- holding it all inside . " She rubbed her knee again . " I do n't want to make our family sound weird . We were n't . Nolan was a regular guy . Partying , chasing girls . Just smarter . He got A 's without working . " " What did he do after dropping out of college ? " " Bummed around , worked different jobs . Then all of a sudden he calls me , announces he 's graduated from the police academy . I had n't heard from him since Mom died . " " When was this ? " " About a year and a half ago . He told me the academy was a joke , Mickey Mouse . He 'd graduated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me just to let me know . In case I happened to see him drive by in a car , I should n't be freaked out . " " Was he assigned to Hollywood from the beginning ? " " No . West L.A. That 's why he thought I might see him , at Cedars . He might come in to the E.R. with a suspect or a victim . " In case I happened to see him . What she 'd described was less a family than a series of accidental pairings . " What kind of jobs did he work before he joined LAPD ? " " Construction , auto repair , crewing on a fishing boat off Santa Barbara . That I remember because Mom showed me some fish he 'd brought her . Halibut . She liked smoked fish and he had some halibut smoked . " " What about relationships with women ? " " He had girlfriends in high school , but after that I do n't know -- can I walk around ? " " Sure . " thing always came easy to Nolan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Maybe that was the problem . He was n't prepared for when things did n't come easy . " " Do you know of specific problems he was having ? " " No , no , I do n't know anything -- I was just thinking back to high school . I used to agonize over algebra and Nolan would waltz into my room , look over my shoulder , and tell me the answer to an equation . Three years younger -- he must have been eleven , but he could figure it out . " She stopped , faced a bookshelf . " When Rick Silverman gave me your name , he told me about his friend on the force and we got into a discussion of the police . Rick said it was a paramilitary organization . Nolan always wanted to be noticed . Why would he be attracted to something so conformist ? " " Maybe he got tired of being noticed , " I said . She stood there for a while , sat back down . " Maybe I 'm doing this because I feel guilty for not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get close . " " Even if you had been close , you could n't have prevented it . " " You 're saying it 's a waste of time to try to stop someone from killing themselves ? " " It 's always important to try to help , and many people who are stopped never attempt again . But if someone 's determined to do it , they 'll eventually succeed . " " I do n't know if Nolan was determined . I do n't know him ! " She burst into loud , racking sobs . When she quieted I handed her a tissue and she snatched it and slapped it against her eyes . " I hate this -- I do n't know if I can keep doing this . " I said nothing . Looking to the side , she said , " I 'm his executor . After Mom died , the lawyer handling our parents ' estate said we should each write a will . " She laughed . " Estate . The house and a bunch of junk . We rented out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce , I asked Nolan if I could live there , send him half the rent . He would n't take it . Said he did n't need it -- did n't need anything . Was that a warning sign ? " Before I could answer , she stood again . " How much more time do we have ? " " Twenty minutes . " . . . SHE 'D PARKED A BROWN MUSTANG OFF THE PROPERTY out on the bridle trial that snakes up from Beverly Glen . The morning air was hot and dusty , the smell of pines from the neighboring ravine piercing and cleansing . " Thanks , " she said , unlocking the car . " Would you like to make another appointment ? " She got in and lowered the window . The car was spotless empty except for two white uniforms hanging over a rear door . " Can I get back to you ? I need to check the on-call schedule . " Patient 's version of do n't call me , I 'll call you . " Of course . " " Thanks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She sped away and I returned to the house , thinking about the meager history she 'd given me . Nolan too smart to be a cop . But plenty of cops were smart . Other **25;99;TOOLONG , macho , dominant , attracted to the dark side -- fit the police stereotype . A few years bumming around before seeking the security of a city job and a pension . Right-wing political views ; I 'd have liked to hear more about that . She 'd also described a partial family history of serious mood disorder . A cop judged " different " by his peers . That could add to the alienation brought about by the job . Nolan 's life sounded full of alienation . So even though his sister was understandably shocked , no big surprises , so far . Nothing that came close to explaining why Nolan had sucked his gun at Go-Ji 's . Not that I was likely to get any closer to it , because the way she 'd left told me it would probably be a one-shot deal . In my business you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
