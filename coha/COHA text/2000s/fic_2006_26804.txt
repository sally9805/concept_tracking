Conrad 's Fate Chapter One When I was small , I always thought Stallery Mansion was some kind of fairy-tale castle . I could see it from my bedroom window , high in the mountains above Stallchester , flashing with glass and gold when the sun struck it . When I got to the place at last , it was n't exactly like a fairy tale . Stallchester , where we had our shop , is quite high in the mountains , too . There are a lot of mountains here in Series Seven , and Stallchester is in the English Alps . Most people thought this was the reason why you could only receive television at one end of the town , but my uncle told me it was Stallery doing it . " It 's the protections they put round the place to stop anyone investigating them , " he said . " The magic blanks out the signal . " My Uncle Alfred was a magician in his spare time , so he knew this sort of thing . Most of the time he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cathedral end of town . He was a skinny , worrity little man with a bald patch under his curls , and he was my mother 's half brother . It always seemed a great burden to him , having to look after me and my mother and my sister , Anthea . He rushed about muttering , " And how do I find the money , Conrad , with the book trade so slow ! " The bookshop was in our name , too  --  it said grant and tesdinic in faded gold letters over the bow windows and the dark green door  --  but Uncle Alfred explained that it belonged to him now . He and my father had started the shop together . Then , just after I was born and a little before he died , my father had needed a lot of money suddenly , Uncle Alfred told me , and he sold his half of the bookshop to Uncle Alfred . Then my father died , and Uncle Alfred had to support us . " And so he should do , " my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only family he 's got . " My sister , Anthea , said she wanted to know what my father had needed the money for , but she never could find out . Uncle Alfred said he did n't know . " And you never get any sense out of Mother , " Anthea said to me . " She just says things like Life is always a lottery ' and Your father was usually hard up , ' so all I can think is that it must have been gambling debts . The casino 's only just up the road after all . " I rather liked the idea of my father gambling half a bookshop away . I used to like taking risks myself . When I was eight , I borrowed some skis and went down all the steepest and iciest ski runs , and in the summer I went rock climbing . I felt I was really following in my father 's footsteps . Unfortunately , someone saw me halfway up Stall Crag and told my uncle . " Ah , no , Conrad , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I ca n't have you taking these risks . " " My dad did , " I said , " betting all that money . " " He lost it , " said my uncle , " and that 's a different matter . I never knew much about his affairs , but I have an idea  --  a very shrewd idea  --  that he was robbed by those crooked aristocrats up at Stallery . " " What ? " I said . " You mean Count Rudolf came with a gun and held him up ? " My uncle laughed and rubbed my head . " Nothing so dramatic , Con . They do things quietly and mannerly up at Stallery . They pull the possibilities like gentlemen . " " How do you mean ? " I said . " I 'll explain when you 're old enough to understand the magic of high finance , " my uncle replied . " Meanwhile ... " His face went all withered and serious . " Meanwhile , you ca n't afford to go risking your neck on Stall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the bad karma you carry . " " What 's karma ? " I asked . " That 's another thing I 'll explain when you 're older , " my uncle said . " Just do n't let me catch you going rock climbing again , that 's all . " I sighed . Karma was obviously something very heavy , I thought , if it stopped you climbing rocks . I went to ask my sister , Anthea , about it . Anthea is nearly ten years older than me , and she was very learned even then . She was sitting over a line of open books on the kitchen table , with her long black hair trailing over the page she was writing notes on . " Do n't bother me now , Con , " she said without looking up . She 's growing up just like Mum ! I thought . " But I need to know what karma is . " " Karma ? " Anthea looked up . She has huge dark eyes . She opened them wide to stare at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except it 's to do with what you did in a former life . Suppose that in a life you had before this one you did something bad , or did n't do something good , then Fate is supposed to catch up with you in this life , unless you put it right by being extra good , of course . Understand ? " " Yes , " I said , though I did n't really . " Do people live more than once then ? " " The magicians say you do , " Anthea answered . " I 'm not sure I believe it myself . I mean , how can you check that you had a life before this one ? Where did you hear about karma ? " Not wanting to tell her about Stall Crag , I said vaguely , " Oh , I read it somewhere . And what 's pulling the possibilities ? That 's another thing I read . " " It 's something that would take ages to explain , and I have n't time , " Anthea said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to understand that I 'm working for an exam that could change my entire life ! " " When are you going to get lunch then ? " I asked . " Is n't that just my life in a nutshell ! " Anthea burst out . " I do all the work round here and help in the shop twice a week , and nobody even considers that I might want to do something different ! Go away ! "
