Travel writers used to know what they were doing . Hemingway was the model : bluff and swaggering , machete for a pen , would n't be caught dead in a fanny pack . But since Papa 's time , travel writers have become either less macho or more honest or both . Now they 're our fellow road worriers : jet-lagged , air enraged , lost their laptops three changes back , their dignity sometime before that . <P> In a way , it 's a relief . Hemingway made you feel like a lazy chump for missing out on the running of the bulls in Pamplona , but the new breed of travel books gives you the oxymoronic pleasure of being both over there and back here at the same time . As Alain de Botton puts it in The Art of Travel ( Pantheon ; 272 pages ) , " We may best be able to inhabit a place when we are not faced with the additional challenge of having to be there . " As travel books go , The Art of Travel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere in particular ; it 's an extended philosophical riff on the act of traveling itself . De Botton 's specialty is the metaphysics of everyday life  --  he is the thinking lad 's Nick Hornby  --  and in The Art of Travel he takes on the how , the why and the what-it-all-means of wanderlust . Mining his own sometimes hapless experiences ( watch for a fight of Nietzschean proportions with his girlfriend in a Barbados cafe ) , De Botton encourages us to savor the small pleasures of traveling : the funny spelling on a Dutch sign , a cypress tree in Provence that 's straight out of a Van Gogh painting , or a stranger 's kitchen glimpsed from a speeding train . <P> Tom Stone 's The Summer of My Greek Taverna ( Simon &; Schuster ; 250 pages ) is concerned with pleasures of an earthier kind : food , drink , sun and sand . When a friend offers Stone a chance to run a restaurant on the tiny Greek island of Patmos , he jumps at it . He obviously has n't heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his new job is less like Zorba the Greek and more like Kitchen Confidential with ouzo . Stone has to deal with tourists who party till dawn , fishermen who want their coffee at 7 a.m. , gossipy locals who are afraid of the evil eye , and a partner who goes by the nickname O Lados ( the Oily One ) . In the end , O Lados gets his just desserts , and so do we , in the form of a generous appendix of Stone 's favorite Greek recipes . <P> And why leave home at all , when you can take it with you ? Trailer Travel : A Visual History of Mobile America ( Gibbs Smith ; 157 pages ) , by Bryan Burkhart , Phil Noyes and Allison Arieff , is a celebration of the American fascination with mobile homes . Most of the photos here are promotional shots , but that simply cranks up the kitsch an extra notch : ' 50s-era nuclear children and busty , bouffant models  --  often in full evening wear  --  grin manically from the plush interiors of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of which look as if they were designed by Buck Rogers on acid . The authors admire their subject with very little irony , but you should feel free to bring your own . Trailer Travel is a glimpse of a moment in time , unimaginable now , when mobile homes were almost cool .
