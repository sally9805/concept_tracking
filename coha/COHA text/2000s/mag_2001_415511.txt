Three moves to build legs you 'll love // TRAINER 'S STRATEGY Firm and shape your inner thighs with both isolation exercises and stabilization moves that work your muscles as you do in daily life . WHY IT WORKS Your inner thighs ( or adductors ) are small stabilizing muscles that have two main functions : to move your legs toward the center of your body and to help your body stay steady as you do things like lunging or in-line skating . By training these muscles to perform their real-life duties , you 'll improve your balance and reduce your risk of injury - not to mention tighten and tone the insides of your thighs , says this month 's featured trainer , Robin Hart . DETAILS For the basic program , do these moves twice a week , taking a day off in between . Add resistance or increase your reps every week ( see " Training Guide , " page 62 ) . After 4 weeks ( or when you feel ready ) , you can progress to the advanced program . For the basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stability ball and a small , squishy ball ( like a child 's ball ) ; the advanced program calls for 3- or 5  --  pound ankle weights . MUSCLE MECHANICS Your inner thighs , a group of five muscles ( adductors magnus , longus and brevis , the gracilis and the pectineus ) attach to your pelvis and thighbone . The adductor muscles move your legs toward and across the midline of your body , help stabilize your body as you stand , walk or climb and help the hips flex , extend and rotate . SHAPE READER MODEL Brianna Sullivan , 20 , weight trains 4-5 times a week . " I started a year ago and I started to see results pretty quickly , " she says , " I felt healthier , energized and more confident . " fine-tuning Concentrate on using your inner thigh muscles to do the work ; do n't just pull the pads with your knees . fine-tuning Focus on keeping your hips level and your torso erect ( try not to lean to one side ) . Use a smooth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you squeeze the ball , be sure to maintain proper leg alignment , keeping your knees above your ankles and in line with your hips . For an extra challenge , lift up onto your toes . stair MASTERY When climbing stairs for fitness , will skipping every other step increase the intensity of your workout ? Can you trust the calorie readouts on cardio machines ? and more ... Three times a week I walk up and down several flights of steps near the beach where I live . Is there any benefit to walking every other step ? And should I walk or run down the steps ? " I suggest that you take every step instead of every other step , " says Neil Maki , a fitness trainer in Bloomfield , Mich . Skipping a step can place too much pressure on your knees , which is the same problem that occurs when you use a step-aerobics platform that 's too high . " You 're forced to , lean forward to help yourself up , and that causes your weight to shift quite a bit forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bends less than 90 degrees , which stresses the joint . // MUSCLES WORKED Photograph You 'll be ready for short-shorts before you know it . Photograph 1 . seated adductor press Photograph 2. standing thigh sweep Photograph 3. ball squeeze // TRAINING GUIDE // A better way to increase the intensity of your workout is to run up the steps instead of walk . But do n't cheat by using the railing to hoist yourself up . Even if you run up the steps , be sure to walk down them . You wo n't increase your calorie burn very much by running down , and you place a lot more stress on your knees . Plus , you 're more likely to trip running down . Q How accurate are the calorie counters on cardio machines ? The bikes at my gym do not ask for your weight , but the treadmills and stair climbers do . Does this mean the bikes are less accurate ? Also , are machines more accurate if they ask for your gender ? A " Cardio machines can be as much as 25-30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10-15 percent , " says John Porcari , Ph.D. , a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Wisconsin , LaCrosse . The accuracy depends heavily on the equations used to calibrate the machine . " There are many different models , and they do n't all use the same equations , " Porcari says . Stationary bikes and treadmills are likely to be more accurate than stair climbers and elliptical trainers , says Porcari , because they have been around longer and studied more thoroughly . Stationary bikes do n't ask for your weight because this information is n't highly relevant to determining your calorie burn during cycling . When you pedal a bike , you are n't supporting your body weight ; you 're simply pushing the pedals . The machine can estimate your calorie burn fairly accurately simply by measuring how much work you 're doing . On the other hand , when you use a stair climber , treadmill or elliptical trainer , your weight is very relevant . " Moving a larger body takes more energy , " Porcari explains . If one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the calorie count could be off as much as 50 percent . The accuracy of weight-bearing machines also depends on your posture . If you grasp the treadmill railings or lean on the stair-climber console , you may burn 25 percent fewer calories than the machine indicates . Photograph To increase the intensity of your stair workout , run up and walk down . // Your gender does n't play a big role in how many calories you burn during the exercise . But a man will have a higher resting metabolic rate because he has more muscle . The bottom line is : Consider calorie readouts to be just a rough guideline , not gospel . Q Does working out in the morning jump-start your metabolism for the whole day and make for better results than working out at night ? A " There is a bit of an acceleration in your metabolism after you work out , but that happens whether you work out in the morning or at night , " says exercise physiologist Daniel Kosich , Ph.D. , president of EXERFIT in Denver . The additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you work out , not what time of day you exercise . Morning exercisers do tend to have more success sticking with their schedules , many trainers report , because as the day goes by , obstacles and excuses can pile up . But that 's not a hard-andfast rule . " Work out whenever it best fits into your schedule , " Kosich says . " The most important thing is to establish a regular workout pattern . " Q I keep reading that everyday tasks like gardening and cleaning the house are enough to keep you in shape . Is that true ? I find that hard to believe . I really hate gyms , so I want to know what the reality is . A " Gardening is better than nothing , but it 's not going to get you fit , " says Kosich. " if you want to get stronger and aerobically fit , you have to challenge yourself with vigorous exercise . " Research has shown that people who do activities such as gardening have lower rates of cardiovascular disease and a decreased risk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's from a health standpoint , " he adds . Fitness is different . If you want to optimize your capabilities , you have to challenge your system more . However , you do n't have to go to a gym . You can strengthen and tone your muscles using dumbbells at home , and you can boost your aerobic fitness by jogging , walking , cycling or using stepaerobics , kickboxing or countless other exercise videos .

Q At my gym there 's a long , light metal pole in the stretching area that people put behind their necks and use for sideto-side twists . Will this help trim my waist , or is it a waste of time ? A Side-to-side twists wo n't help trim your waist , but they 're great for maintaining rotational flexibility , says Camilla Callaway , a fitness trainer in Columbus , Ga. , and a spokeswoman for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life , most of us tend to do forward motions , like running or biking , " Callaway explains . " But at work , you might be sitting at a desk and then twist to answer the phone or grab something . If the muscles at your waist are tight and inflexible , you can strain your back just reaching to pick up a pen . " To trim your waistline , you need to reduce your overall body fat by eating less and combining cardiovascular exercise with strength training . Strengthening your abdominal muscles can help by improving your posture . Callaway also recommends exercises that target your lats , the middle-back muscles ; firmer , wider lats can make your waist appear smaller .
