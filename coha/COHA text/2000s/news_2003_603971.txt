<p> In Old West movies , the cavalry wears dusty uniforms and brandishes six-shooters . In NASCAR , the hard chargers riding to the rescue wear backward ballcaps and holster M players full of downloaded Kid Rock songs . <p> NASCAR 's hot new generation of 20-something drivers could n't have come along at a better time because the sport soon will face the prospect of replacing some of its best-known veterans . Dale Jarrett , Terry Labonte , Rusty Wallace , Bill Elliott , Sterling Marlin , Ricky Rudd , Mark Martin and Kyle Petty are in their 40s ; some veterans remain competitive , but none are expected to stick around for more than a few years . <p> " I 'm not saying they 're getting ready to retire or should retire , " Petty says . " ( But ) when you start looking , there are seven or eight guys who theoretically could all of a sudden at the end of the year say , ' Hey , I do n't want to play anymore . ' There 's seven open seats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming . And it may not happen all in one year , but I think it 'll happen in three or four years . " <p> If you had to pick a favorite for the 2003 Winston Cup championship , it likely would be Tony Stewart or Jeff Gordon  --  drivers in their early 30s who have enough experience to perform consistently for 10 months but are young enough to adjust to the changing nature of racing . Still , it would n't be a shock if a " young gun " jumped up to steal the title . <p> They 're certainly not lacking confidence . <p> " I feel like good fortune and championships and solid success is just right in our face and coming our way , " says Dale Earnhardt Jr. , 28 . " I 'm looking forward to this year with a lot of anticipation and feel like we 're going to run great at tracks we have n't in the past . We 've really buckled down . There is a lot more understanding amongst the ( crew ) than there has been in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other than we were in the past . We 've learned a lot over the past several years that is really going to make us a great team . I think we 're there , and I think we can do it this year . " <p> And they do n't seem to be feeling much pressure . Unlike drivers such as Martin , Marlin and Rudd , who are running out of time to win their first championship , younger drivers are n't carrying any baggage . <p> " Obviously , we 've all got time on our side , " says Kurt Busch , 24 . " The pressure 's there to win , but we 've got many years ahead of us to where we 're not putting pressure on ourselves . We finished third in the points , and I want to continue moving forward , so that gives us just a couple spots in range . " <p> Still , nothing is guaranteed for NASCAR 's up-and-coming generation . The Winston Cup points system rewards consistency , and young drivers tend to be streaky . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvick last season , a cautionary tale for Jimmie Johnson and Ryan Newman . And a proposed rules change could swing momentum back toward the veterans . <p> Why are young guns winning ? <p> The go-go economy of the mid-1990s might have provided a temporary boost to veteran drivers ' stock portfolios , but indirectly it probably ended up leaving some in the dust on the track . <p> An influx of corporate sponsorship money pushed top racing teams ' annual budgets past $ 15 million , allowing them to spend more time developing sleeker cars in the wind tunnel ; NASCAR officials measure cars with templates several times every weekend to make sure hoods and fenders conform to general guidelines , but team engineers have some freedom to refine their cars ' shapes . ( That freedom is being restricted by NASCAR 's garage boss , John Darby , who has introduced several additional templates in his second year as Winston Cup series director . ) <p> The resulting cars stuck to the track much better , but only the drivers and crew chiefs who were willing to change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to get the most out of the improvements . Before engineers took over racing , crew chiefs would work with drivers to see what suspension and tire pressure settings felt most comfortable to the driver ; today , complex computer simulations are spitting out setups designed not to make the driver comfy but to make the aerodynamics work properly . <p> Veteran drivers , however , were used to setting up their cars by seat-of-the-pants reckoning and relying on what worked in the past at each track . Jeff Burton acknowledges he has struggled to adjust and now realizes he must take a more hands-off role in his team 's technical decisions after two disappointing seasons . He is n't alone ; Bobby Labonte has struggled since winning the championship in 2000 , and Wallace is coming off his first winless season since 1985 . <p> " A younger driver and a younger crew chief may be more open to more information , whereas Rusty was looking at it and saying , ' I know how to win Rockingham . I 've won Rockingham . You 've got to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " Burton says . " Our sport has progressed so quickly that you ca n't run off of yesterday 's notes anymore . You have to be further ahead of the race rather than looking back at the last race . And that 's one of the things , in my opinion , that my team and myself did n't do very well . We did n't figure out how to adjust . " <p> Rookies such as Newman and Johnson came into the sport with blank mental slates , willing to try whatever their engineers and crew chiefs wanted . Now that they 've won races , will they continue to listen ? <p> " I think that part of the historic ' sophomore jinx ' thing is , ' Boy , I 've got it all figured out now . I know how to do it , ' " Burton says . " And there 's something to be said for ignorance . " <p> Then there are off-track commitments and distractions that a driver might not have noticed amid the excitement of his rookie year . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Earnhardt insisted that he cut his sponsor appearance schedule in half . Negotiations dragged on , but he got the concessions . <p> Harvick says the non-racing aspects of his job caught up with him last season . " From my standpoint , it was like everybody was all of a sudden coming at you in a hundred different directions , " he says . " You 're trying to please everybody . " <p> Of course , Harvick did n't make it easy on himself last season , catching the eyes of NASCAR officials with his aggressive driving style . " I think Kevin Harvick created a little of the pressure he had , " Newman snorts . " We 'll just do the same things we did last year . " <p> Many sponsors still want to project a hip image so young drivers continue to get top-level rides . The first-year success of Harvick , Johnson and Newman raised the bar for this year 's rookie crop , which includes Chip Ganassi Racing rookies Casey Mears and Jamie McMurray . <p> But if these drivers do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atwood ; after two lackluster seasons with Ray Evernham 's team , Atwood does n't have a Cup ride for 2003 . <p> " I think it 's a double-edged sword for a young driver , " Petty says . " You take Jimmie Johnson or Ryan Newman . If they had n't come out and run good last year , they 'd be on the hot seat this year . If they did n't do anything this year , chances are their career would be over with . Casey 's a good example of someone who came in , was hyped to the max , lots of expectations , he did n't get a second chance . " <p> Change in momentum ? <p> A group of veterans , headed by Wallace and Gordon , is lobbying NASCAR officials to institute a rules change it says will make racing better and , perhaps not coincidentally , might shift momentum back to experienced drivers . <p> They want to make aerodynamics less important by cutting down the height of each car 's rear spoiler and having Goodyear produce a softer tire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Two years ago Goodyear introduced a harder tire that did n't grip the track as well but did n't wear down as quickly . Veterans ran into the same problems they encountered with the more aerodynamic cars : Suspension setups that used to work well did n't work anymore , and some of them would n't listen to suggestions from team engineers . <p> When it comes to improving the racing , the veterans might have a point . There were no last-lap passes for the lead last season , and 28 of 36 races did n't have any lead changes in the final 10 laps . Wallace and Gordon blame a phenomenon called " aero push , " meaning cars that depend on aerodynamics to handle properly do n't handle as well when they 're in another car 's wake , making passing more difficult . Stickier tires might make passing easier . <p> Wallace has lobbied NASCAR officials and Goodyear and expects them to try the proposed changes sometime this season . " I 'm going at it , raising hell , " Wallace says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they know it 's the right thing to do . " <p> But with race car drivers , self-interest often is the primary motivation . <p> " Last time we did that , Jeff won 13 races , so I know why he 's lobbying for it , " says Evernham , Gordon 's former crew chief and an advocate for reducing the importance of aerodynamics because it will save teams money . " Maybe I ought to go lobby with him ; maybe my old notes will work . " <p> Do Wallace , Gordon and other veterans just want to return to the stickier tires they are used to racing with ? <p> " That 's what it sounds like to me , " Harvick says . " I 'm not by any means sitting here bashing them . I 'm just saying that . . . that 's what they 're accustomed to and that 's what they like . Unfortunately , this sport has progressed and changed through the years and it 's not the same as it used to be . That might end up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know if that 's the right way to go . " <p> Petty says any attempts to limit aerodynamics will prove futile because top teams will just spend more money to come up with new aerodynamic innovations . <p> Even if NASCAR adopts the veterans ' proposals , Newman is n't concerned that he and the other young drivers will lose the edge they appeared to have last year : <p> " I do n't think it 's going to favor any veterans or young guys  --  it 's just who 's got their stuff together .
