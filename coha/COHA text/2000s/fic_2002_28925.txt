Romancing Mister Bridgerton Chapter One Matchmaking mamas are united in their glee  --  Colin Bridgerton has returned from Greece ! For those gentle ( and ignorant ) readers who are new to town this year , Mr. Bridgerton is third in the legendary string of eight Bridgerton siblings ( hence the name Colin , beginning , with C. he follows Anthony and Benedict , and precedes Daphne , Eloise , Francesca , Gregory , and Hyacinth ) . Although Mr. Bridgerton holds no noble title and is unlikely ever to do so ( he is seventh in line for the title of Viscount Bridgerton , behind the two sons of the current viscount , his elder brother Benedict , and his three sons ) he is still considered one of the prime catches of the season , due to his fortune , his face , his form , and most of all , his charm . It is difficult , however , to predict whether Mr. Bridgerton will succumb to matrimonial bliss this season , he is certainly of an age to many ( three-and-thirty ) , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of proper parentage , and to make matters even more complicated , he has an appalling tendency to leave London at the drop of a hat , bound for some exotic destination . LADY WHISTLEDOWN 'S SOCIETY PAPERS , 2 APRIL 1824 " Look at this ! " Portia Featherington squealed . " Colin Bridgerton is back ! " Penelope looked up from her needlework . Her mother was clutching the latest edition of Lady Whistledown 's Society Papers the way Penelope might clutch , say , a rope while hanging off a building . " I know , " she murmured . Portia frowned . She hated when someone  --  anyone  --  was aware of gossip before she was . " How did you get to Whistledown before I did ? I told Briarly to set it aside for me and not to let anyone touch  --  " " I did n't see it in Whistledown , " Penelope interrupted , before her mother went off to castigate the poor , beleaguered butler . " Felicity told me . Yesterday afternoon . Hyacinth Bridgerton told her . " " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bridgerton household . " " As do I " Penelope pointed out , wondering where this was leading . Portia tapped her finger against the side of her chin , as she always did when she was plotting or scheming . " Colin Bridgerton is of an age to be looking for a wife . " Penelope managed to blink just before her eyes bugged right out of her head . " Colin Bridgerton is not going to marry Felicity ! " Portia gave a little shrug . " Stranger things have happened . " " Not that I 've ever seen , " Penelope muttered . " Anthony Bridgerton married that Kate Sheffield girl , and she was even less popular than you . " That was n't exactly true ; Penelope rather thought they 'd been on equally low rungs of the social ladder . But there seemed little point in telling this to her mother , who probably thought she 'd complimented her third daughter by saying she 'd not been the least popular girl that season . Penelope felt her lips tightening . Her mother 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do not think I mean to criticize , " Portia said , suddenly all concern . " In truth , I am glad for your spinsterhood . I am alone in this world save for my daughters , and it 's comforting to know that one of you shall be able to care for me in my older years . " Penelope had a vision of the future  --  the future as described by her mother  --  and she had a sudden urge to run out and marry the chimney sweep . She 'd long since resigned herself to a life of eternal spinsterhood , but somehow she 'd always pictured herself off in her own neat little terrace house . Or maybe a snug cottage by the sea . But lately Portia had been peppering her conversations with references to her old age and how lucky she was that Penelope could care for her . Never mind that both Prudence and Philippa had married well-heeled men and possessed ample funds to see to their mother 's every comfort . Or that Portia was moderately wealthy in her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a dowry , one-fourth had been set aside for her own personal account . No , when Portia talked about being " cared for , " she was n't referring to money . What Portia wanted was a slave . Penelope sighed . She was being overly harsh with her mother , if only in her own mind . She did that too often . Her mother loved her . She knew her mother loved her . And she loved her mother back . It was just that sometimes she did n't much like her mother . She hoped that did n't make her a bad person . But truly , her mother could try the patience of even the kindest , gentlest of daughters , and as Penelope was the first to admit , she could be a wee bit sarcastic at times . " Why do n't you think Colin would marry Felicity ? " Portia asked . Penelope looked up , startled . She 'd thought they were done with that subject . She should have known better . Her mother was nothing if not tenacious . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with , she 's twelve years younger than he is . " " Pfft , " Portia said , waving her hand dismissively . " That 's nothing , and you know it . " Penelope frowned , then yelped as she accidentally stabbed her finger with her needle . " Besides ' " Portia continued blithely , " he 's "  --  she looked back down at Whistledown and scanned it for his exact age  --  three-and-thirty ! How is he meant to avoid a twelve-year difference between him and his wife ? Surely you do n't expect him to marry someone your age . " Penelope sucked on her abused finger even though she knew it was hopelessly uncouth to do so . But she needed to put something in her mouth to keep her from saying something horrible and horribly spiteful . Everything her mother said was true . Many ton weddings --  maybe even most of them  --  saw men marrying girls a dozen or more years their junior . But somehow the age gap between Colin and Felicity seemed even larger , perhaps because ...   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
