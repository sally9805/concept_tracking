Since the late 1990s Wilbur Zelinsky 's theory of " heterolocalism " has provided human geographers and other social scientists with a new approach to analyzing the spatial patterns and ethnic identities of recent immigrants in the United States . Zelinsky 's heterolocal model suggests that , to a degree unknown in the past , new migrants in North American cities may choose to settle in widely dispersed places , rather than in more concentrated ethnic enclaves , while maintaining their ethnic identities . This article expands on and critiques prior work on heterolocalism in Oregon by examining the spatial patterns , ethnic and religious identities , and transnational relationships of two recent refugee groups in three urban areas in the Pacific Northwest . Using data from U.S. and Canadian census records , refugee resettlement agency files , survey questionnaires , structured and unstructured interviews , and participant observation with post-Soviet Russians and Ukrainians in the Vancouver , British Columbia , Seattle , Washington , and Portland , Oregon metropolitan areas , I analyze the spatial patterns and related social networks that define the identities and residential and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relating heterolocalism and transnationalism across an international boundary . <p> Keywords : Canada ; heterolocalism ; Pacific Northwest ; refugees ; transnationalism ; United States <p> Human geographers have become increasingly interested in studies of North American immigration patterns and processes during the past four decades . After the passage of new and more open immigration laws in the 1960s , the arrival of large numbers of immigrants , refugees , and asylum seekers from Latin . America , Asia , and Africa added new ethnic dimensions to geographical studies of the migration , settlement patterns , and adjustment experiences of new and ever more diverse arrivals in the United States and Canada . Of particular importance in recent years have been ongoing efforts to provide new ways of thinking about the relationship among the settlement patterns of new migrants , their adjustment and adaptation rates , and the maintenance of their ethnic identities ( see Liberson 1961 ; Jaret 1991 ; Li 1998 ; Hiebert 1999 ; Roseman , Laux , and Thieme 1999 ) .

Today , many foreignborn migrants settle in multicultural suburbs located far from downtown neighborhoods ( Portes and Jensen 1987 ; Thompson 1989 ; Zhou and Logan 1991 ; Omi and Winant 1994 ; Wright and Ellis 2000 ; Wright , Ellis , and Parks 2004 ) . <p> To add both fuel and clarity to this ongoing debate , Wilbur Zelinsky and his colleague Barrett Lee ( 1998 ) debuted a new model for the study of the geography of immigration in the late 1990s called " heterolocalism . " Three years later this new perspective on the relationship between the spatial patterns of new immigrants , and the social networks that help maintain their ethnic identities without residential propinquity , was expanded and refined in Zelinsky 's seminal book on ethnicity , race , and space . <p> To test , critique , and expand on his model , I have been engaged in a long-term analysis of the spatial patterns and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest , especially those who arrived in North America between 1990 and 2006 . This article reports on some of the findings of this ongoing study , with a focus on the experiences of two large groups of refugees and immigrants in the region : Russians and Ukrainians. ( n1 ) I pose a series of new questions about their residential patterns and ethnoreligious identities . After brief background information on the migration and settlement stories of these two related groups , I pay particular attention to the impacts of residential and religious space on the ever-shifting terrain of ethnic identity . This analysis of the U.S.-Canadian borderland in the Pacific Northwest is one of the first attempts to analyze the relationship between heterolocalism and transnationalism to map out potential social and spatial relationships , patterns , and identities at a variety of scales . Many of the ideas presented here owe their origin to a synthesis of Zelinsky 's prior work in ethnic and population geography , urban and historical geography , the geography of religion , and North American cultural landscapes . ANALYZING A WORLD IN MOTION <p> For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most effective way to analyze a world in motion brought on by the drama of international migration . A few examples of these many studies are listed here . According to some scholars , political borders are now blurred sites of flexible identities ( see , for example , Appadurai 1991 ; Bailey and others 2002 ) . In their view , it might be assumed that ethnic and national identities at the borderland dividing the United States and Canada in the Pacific Northwest region and elsewhere are rapidly becoming permeable sites of hybridity and flow . Other theorists suggest that , to accommodate and make sense out of this ongoing and often dramatic globalization process , scholars have had to construct new ways to conceptualize and write about the processes involved in immigration . <p> A great deal of work by human geographers , sociologists , anthropologists , and other scholars who formerly had little regard for the critical role of place and space in analyzing the immigrant experience has been accomplished in recent years . Chief among these studies has been work in four areas of research : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their ethnic identities ( for example , Wright and Ellis 2000 ; Wright , Ellis , and Parks 2004 ) ; segmented assimilation ( for example , Portes and Borocz 1989 ; Portes and Zhou 1993 ; Rumbaut 1994 ; McHugh , Miyares , and Skop 1997 ; Zhou 1997 ) ; studies of transnationalism and international migration ( for example , Portes 1996 ; Glick Schiller , Basch , and Szanton Blanc 1999 ; Faist 2000 ; Hyndman and Walton-Roberts 2000 ) ; and research on the social and human capital and social networks of immigrants ( for example , Bourdieu 1985 ; Granovetter 1985 ; Coleman 1990 ; Portes and Landolt 1996 ; Kaplan 1997 ; Menjivar 1997 ; Cao 1998 ; Mitchell 2000 ; Hardwick 2003b ) . <p> Human geographers interested in immigration issues have been engaged primarily in work framed by an integrated set of spatial and social questions . Few , however , have focused attention on the role of religion in shaping spatial patterns . Rather , a great deal of this research has been centered on a critique of traditional models of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the early and mid-twentieth century . This " invasion-succession " or " straight-line assimilation model " of the University of Chicago sociologists Ernest Burgess , Robert Park , and others postulated that immigrants first settle in affordable , central-city immigrant enclaves because of lower housing costs , nearness to employment opportunities , and proximity to coethnic networks ( see , for example , Park and Burgess 1921 ; Park , Burgess , and McKenzie 1925 ) . Over time , as immigrants ' wage-earning ability , English-language skills , overall move up the economic and social ladder , and familiarity with the dominant society grow , they relocate to suburban residential districts dominated by native-born , white residents . According to this view , this move outward helps escalate structural assimilation rates for immigrants by giving them access to the institutions and support structures of white U.S. or Canadian society . <p> As geographers such as Wilbur Zelinsky and others such as Audrey Singer ( 2004 ) have recently made clear , however , a great deal has changed since urban sociologists working in ethnic neighborhoods in Chicago pioneered their now-classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1965 was passed , migrants from Latin America , Asia , and Africa became the dominant groups to settle in North American cities . For many of these more recent arrivals in the United States and Canada , a racialized assimilation experience made their settlement and survival experiences dramatically different from those of earlier white European groups . <p> Coupled with changes in the races and places of origin of the majority of post-1965 incoming migrants have been changes in the morphologies and socioeconomic structures of North American cities and their regional economies . The increased costs of living in gentrified downtown neighborhoods , for example , availability of employment in the suburbs , ease of transportation from one part of the city to another , and other economic and political factors have contributed to the plethora of critiques concerning the now-dated Chicago School model and the need for a new way of thinking about the relationship between the spatial patterns of immigrants and their identities and adaptation experiences . As a result of these economic , political , social , and cultural changes , as Wei Li 's ( 1998 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illustrates , many , if not most , of today 's new immigrants are settling outside traditional , central-city ethnic enclaves , concentrating instead on residing in multiethnic or majority-white suburban neighborhoods . <p> As the life and landscape of native-born and foreign-born residents of North American cities continue to change , the search for new ways to conceptualize their settlement patterns , experiences , and impacts continues . Zelinsky and Lee 's ( 1998 ) and Zelinsky 's ( 200l ) contributions to heterolocalism made a cogent and controversial contribution to the debate . Their argument for a " new and improved " model with which to describe and analyze the settlement patterns and related ethnic identities of certain groups of foreign-born migrants drew attention to the role of a trio of related geographical concerns  --  place , scale , and networks  --  often overlooked by other critics of classic assimilation theory . Heterolocalism suggests that an ethnic community can exist with no significant residential clustering , while maintaining strong and enduring ethnic identities through participation in ethnic networks and other social and cultural ties . In the heterolocal view @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ethnic identity . RELATING HETEROLOCALISM AND TRANSNATIONALISM <p> Perhaps the most important contribution of Zelinsky 's heterolocal model is its innovative critique of traditional Chicago School studies that linked immigrant settlement patterns with land values , land use , and economic issues in U.S. cities . This classic Chicago School view of immigrant settlement argued that most foreign-born migrants settled in downtown neighborhoods where housing was most affordable . Their land-use models also predicted that immigrant groups would move outward to the suburbs only when they became more assimilated . Heterolocalism , on the other hand , argues that a whole new set of processes are now under way in North American urban areas that are changing the residential decision making of immigrant groups . As the cost of downtown housing has increased due to gentrification during the past two decades , for example , and other nongentrified parts of the inner city have become dominated by native-born minority groups , the majority of today 's incoming groups choose to settle in more affordable suburban neighborhoods rather than in more expensive or otherwise difficult inner-city districts . Mong with this increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the metropolitan area instead of in high-density ethnic enclaves , as they did in the past . Along with these changes in the residential patterns of recent immigrants have come dramatic improvements in transportation systems and communication technologies in cities . These improvements are making it possible for many newcomers to stay in close contact with their friends and family from home  --  and thus potentially maintain their ethnic identities through time despite their dispersed spatial patterns . <p> In The Enigma of Ethnicity ( 200l ) Zelinsky expanded and clarified his earlier take on heterolocalism by relating his theory to larger geographical and social questions , such as the relationship between heterolocalism and transnationalism . He also expanded his discussion of applying this new model to a variety of scales to address Richard Wright and Mark Ellis 's critique that heterolocalism , as originally conceived , failed to acknowledge that " how well immigrants fit into our society . is increasingly constructed at a regional scale " rather than only at the metropolitan scale ( Wright and Ellis 2000 , 197 ) . Zelinsky also provided a summary list of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and immediate dispersion of new immigrants within the receiving society ; residence and workplace at some distance from each other ; lack of spatial overlap between social activities , shopping districts , and residential space ; and strong community and ethnic ties that are maintained by telecommunications ( for example , cell phones , e-mail messages ) , personal visits , and other methods of communication . All of these factors point to the absence of spatial residential propinquity , one of the key tenets of the Chicago model . According to Zelinsky , " Quite a few ethnic populations appear capable of sustaining lively , interactive communities without the aid of territorial clustering . The basic notion of ' community without propinquity ' was first proposed by Melvin Webber ( 1964 ) in a seminal essay more than thirty years ago that was not specifically concerned with ethnic matters . Since then , much empirical evidence has accumulated attesting to the vigor of the phenomenon , as seen in a variety of ethnically based social and economic networks " ( 200l , 139 ) . <p> In contrast to other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterritorialized web of connections that maintains heterolocalism exists at both metropolitan and nonmetropolitan scales and may even find expression at the transnational or global scale . As Zelinsky reminds us ( 200l , 140-141 ) , inexpensive air travel and cross-border trips by car make it possible for immigrants to visit their homelands regularly ( Suro 1993 ) ; video cameras help create and sustain transnational communities and relationships ( Smith 1993 ; Sontag 1998 ) ; courier services and electronic media help sustain transnational ties across borders ( Richman 1992 ) ; and teleconferencing makes it possible , for example , for Salvadorans and other groups living in Washington , D.C. and other U.S. cities to retain their special identities and ties to home ( Farah 1996 ) . <p> I present data to test , analyze , and build on each of the key tenets of Zelinsky 's heterolocal theory , using evidence from two related groups of transnational migrants who now reside in close proximity on both sides of an international border . The United States  --  Canadian borderlands offer a unique opportunity to explore the potential relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiving societies for immigrants and refugees and their shared cultural and linguistic backgrounds . Analyzing recent immigrant and refugee arrivals to this cross-border region provides new evidence on heterocalism and transnationalism that builds on Zelinsky 's suggestion that " Also on the research agenda is the applicability . to other settler countries that have received major influxes of immigrants , most notably Canada , Argentina , Brazil , South Africa , and Australia . What relevance does the American set of models have for such places ? . Will it be necessary to contrive additional theoretical formulations , or does heterolocalism , with its transnational dimension , offer some hope ? " ( 2001,153 ) . THE POST  --  SOVIET DIASPORA IN THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST <p> Post-1990s-era Russians and Ukrainians are the focus of this analysis of heterolocalism and transnationalism for several key reasons . They reside in the study area in large enough numbers to make the results of the study significant . In both Washington and Oregon , these two Russian-speaking groups constitute the largest refugee groups ( U.S. Census Bureau 2003 ) . Significant numbers of post-Soviet Ukrainians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Vancouver and its environs . These Slavic migrants have a great deal in common on both sides of the border . Not surprisingly , all are white . Perhaps more surprisingly , almost all of the refugees on the U.S. side of the border are Protestant Christians ( Figure 1 ) . Many of their coreligionists reside in small towns near the Canadian-United States border and in Vancouver suburbs . <p> The majority of these new residents of Canada and the United States have arrived since the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s . Many lived in the same towns and cities in their homeland , and most belonged to the same church congregation prior to departure ( Hardwick 1993 , 2002 ) . These relationships and connections , as well as U.S. and Canadian family-reunification policies for refugees and immigrants , have resulted in a particularly intense type of chain migration in the study area . An overlapping network of religious , ethnic , social , cultural , and economic linkages in which many participated prior to departure for North America is sustained in their new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence on both sides of an international border , make Russians and Ukrainians ideal groups for learning more about heterolocalism in both a national context and an international one . Given their common migration paths and settlement nodes , active religious , economic , and social networks , white skin , and common ethnoreligious identity , it could be predicted that these groups of migrants should have maximum residential choices because , except for linguistic challenges , they have the potential to blend invisibly into the white , Protestant-dominated cultures and societies of this transborder North American region . HETEROLOCALISM REEXAMINED <p> The first task was to analyze a set of maps showing the residential patterns of Russians and Ukrainians in the Portland , Oregon-Vancouver , Washington metropolitan area and its hinterland in the Pacific Northwest ( Hardwick 2003a ) . However , it became clear that the factors involved in shaping the predicted heterolocal patterns of these two white , Protestant groups were more complex than anticipated . Residential dispersal of Oregon 's Russians and Ukrainians did emerge on the maps , but not as Zelinsky had predicted . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hardwick and Meacham 2005 ) . I call this new and as-yet-untested pattern " nodal heterolocalism . " <p> In 2000 , according to their distribution by census tract , a broad and wide dispersal of these groups existed , with many living in Vancouver , Washington , just north of the Columbia River . Others resided in the suburbs and small towns located east and south of Portland along the Interstate 205 and Interstate 5 corridors . Relatively high-density clusters of these two groups were found living in census tracts in city centers , suburbs , exurbs , and small rural towns . This noncontiguous pattern of heterolocal nodes was especially evident in the Greater Willamette Valley region , with Russians and Ukrainians living in pockets of high-density , linear settlements from Vancouver , Washington in the north to as far south as Eugene at the southern end of the Willamette Valley , with wide , non-Slavicized spaces of open , rural land in between ( Hardwick and Meacham 2005 ) . <p> Given that the vast majority of the 80,000-plus Russians and Ukrainians in western Oregon arrived in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were persecuted for their religious belief in the former Soviet Union , these Baptist , Pentecostal , and Seventh Day Adventist believers often arrived with their entire congregation from home . Most were sponsored by church congregations already in place in the Pacific Northwest . They preferred to reside in the neighborhood or small towns close to the churches that sponsored them or near other believers from their homeland . This makes church patterns critically important factors in helping establish residential clusters and key to understanding and interpreting nodal patterns ( Hardwick and Meacham 2005 ) . Interestingly , most of the missionaries who traveled to Russia , Ukraine , and the former Soviet Union were not from the three cities analyzed in this research . Most originated in Baptist and Pentecostal churches in the San Francisco Bay Area and Sacramento and other cities in California 's Central Valley , sites of Russian and Ukrainian Christian settlement that began about a decade earlier than it did in the Pacific Northwest ( Hardwick 1993 ) . <p> A similar pattern of religiously based nodal heterolocalism exists in cities and towns along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Washington , as in Oregon , because the majority of arrivals from the former Soviet Union continue to have refugee status , many come closely affiliated with church congregations in the United States or at home and/or are family members of antecedent migrants from their homeland . These post-Soviet-era Russian and Ukrainian migrants reside in a linear pattern along this primary transportation corridor from Vancouver , Washington in the south to the Canadian border in the north . EXPANDING THE MODEL TO A REGIONAL AND TRANSNATIONAL SCALE <p> The patterns of settlement for Oregon and Washington establish the relationship between Russian and Ukrainian residential patterns and religious and ethnic identities . Building on this U.S.-based analysis , Zelinsky 's nudge to examine heterolocalism at larger regional and even at transnational scales encouraged me to extend my work across the Canadian-United States border . Examining the same two groups of migrants in an international study in Washington and British Columbia seemed a logical next step in testing his model outside the United States . Here , in a region often called " Cascadia " and viewed as a relatively integrated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and cultural networks and relationships  --  as well as its shared physical geography  --  I postulated that the patterns and experiences of Russians and Ukrainians in Canada should be similar to those in the United States . <p> However , despite their common whiteness , language , religious beliefs , and places of origin , a host of significant differences exist between Russian and Ukrainian migrants who currently reside in the northwestern United States and those who live in Canada . These differences give substance to Jennifer Hyndman and Margaret Walton-Roberts ' argument that transnationalism " is not simply a theoretical perspective , but a nexus of social and material relationships which blur the centrality of borders " ( 2000 , 24 ) . The lack of social , religious , and material relationships linking the majority of Russians and Ukrainians in this United States-Canadian borderland region is caused by differences in the two nations ' immigration policies . Thus an examination of Russian and Ukrainian transnational patterns and experiences must include not only an analysis of their residential patterns and identities but also an understanding of the impacts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible to understand how transnationalism does or does not affect potential transborder heterolocalism  --  and vice versa . <p> These critically important differences in the political status of Russian and Ukrainian migrants currently living in British Columbia and those who have settled " south of the border " are framed by differing policies defining whether these two groups are " refugees " or " immigrants . " All of the religiously defined incoming Russians and Ukrainians in Oregon and Washington and elsewhere in the United States are still classified as refugees by the American government even though the cold war ended more than a decade ago . This classification allows them to enter the country in larger numbers than other nonrefugee groups and also requires them to have a sponsor in place before being allowed to enter the country . " Refugee status " is defined by the United States based on the Geneva Convention and the U.S. Refugee Act passed in 1980 . It grants " a permanent and systematic procedure for the admission . of refugees of special humanitarian concern in the U.S. " ( Kritz 1983 , xviii @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as persons who lived outside their homeland and were unable or unwilling to return to it because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution . Because of their religious beliefs and the government opposition to them during the Socialist years of rule in the former Soviet Union , most Russians and Ukrainians are able to enter the United States with refugee status . This guarantees housing for each family or individual , as well as monthly stipends that are paid in return for regular attendance at language and employment training during their first months of residency . According to a Russian refugee in the Seattle area : " My family could not have come here without being a part of this refugee system , you know ? They provided us with a lot of help when we first arrived . Oh sure , I do n't like it much when my children 's teachers refer to us as ' refugees , ' or other people think that we 're takers because Russia is n't Communist now . but it 's worth it to get all this support " ( Sasha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that the cold war has ended and the Russian Federation and Ukraine are presumed to be places that support basic human rights , the government no longer classifies people from the former Soviet Union as refugees , although many did arrive with refugee status before and immediately after the breakup of the Soviet Union . Instead , most enter the country as skilled workers , with some arriving as business-class migrants ( entrepreneurial class or investor class ) under the point system ( see Ley 2003 for a further analysis of economic migrants in Canada ) . This means that their numbers are much lower in British Columbia than in Washington or Oregon and that only a small percentage of incoming Russians and Ukrainians in Canada are members of the Christian groups that define the majority of those settling in the northwestern United States . But do these political and economic differences in their backgrounds result in differences in their residential patterns or the maintenance of their ethnic identities ? <p> Despite differences in their admission status , a number of more local place-based findings emerged after mapping British Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2001 ) ( Figures 2 and 3 ) and interviewing post-Soviet-era Russian and Ukrainian immigrants in southwestern British Columbia and resettlement-agency staff in the Vancouver metropolitan area . Canadian migrants who are members of Baptist , Pentecostal , or Seventh Day Adventist churches reside in two places in the region : in towns located in close proximity to the U.S. border , as shown in Figure 2 , and in neighborhoods near Vancouver 's few evangelical Christian churches in the areas of highest concentration of Russians and Ukrainians , as shown in Figure 3 . These ethnoreligiously defined heterolocal nodes closely resemble residential and religious patterns found in western Oregon and Washington despite differing political definitions or religious belief systems upon arrival in each country . This provides evidence that participation in church networks and the cohesion of religious belief systems , along with the desire to live near others from their homeland as did earlier immigrants studied by the Chicago School , all contribute to shaping nodal heterolocalism . <p> Transnational religious connections abound along the U.S.-Canadian border , linking Russian and Ukrainian Christian fundamentalists who live in British Columbia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities in places like Peaceful Valley ( Figure 4 ) - On a typical Sunday morning , rows of cars bearing British Columbia license plates fill parking lots outside Russian and Ukrainian churches and schools that host Slavic Pentecostal and Baptist services . Families routinely and regularly travel across the border to attend church in the United States . <p> This finding begs the question : Coupled with the critically important role of religious networks and refugee sponsors in resettlement decision making and the maintenance of ethnic and religious identity , how important are a host of other local-to-global political , social , and economic networks in shaping settlement processes that operate on both sides of the United States-Canadian border ? Most significantly , how does the work of resettlement agencies such as the MOSAIC in Vancouver and the Immigrant and Refugee Community Organization in Portland help create and sustain heterolocal patterns ? Their important role is easier to assess in the case of refugees , because resettlement agencies are most often centers of language and employment training and the place where monthly stipends may be picked up . But many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centers for help with language training , assistance finding medical care , and advice related to housing decisions . <p> These findings on Russians and Ukrainians in western Canada and the United States question Zelinsky 's assumption that recently arrived migrants act as free agents who independently choose whether to reside near other compatriots or in widely dispersed parts of a metropolitan area . The results of my work on Russians and Ukrainians indicate that nodal heterolocalism exists at all scales of analysis and is based on the locations of religious institutions , on the assistance of social-service providers , and on decisions made by immigrant and refugee resettlement agencies ; that the initial places of settlement for new migrants in cities like Portland and Seattle in the United States and Vancouver in Canada are no longer inner-city neighborhoods where housing in gentrified areas is too expensive or affordable housing is too dangerous ; and that even white European groups , who presumably experience minimal racial restrictions , are forming dispersed settlement clusters in some of today 's North American towns and cities , much as did the white European groups @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago . <p> Perhaps most interesting is the finding related to the close and lingering relationship between shared religious beliefs , ethnic identity , and residential patterns on both sides of the Canadian-United States border . Virtually all of the Russians and Ukrainians interviewed for this study who reside in small Canadian towns near the United States asserted that the reason they chose to live so close to the border was to make it easier for them to attend Christian churches in nearby Washington towns such as Bellingham and Kendall . During structured and unstructured interviews for this project on both sides of the border , the majority of these spiritually defined transnational migrants enthusiastically claimed Canadian national and political identity while also identifying closely with coreligionists in the United States . One respondent replied to a question about identity : " I do n't really feel like I am a Russian since my country has changed so much since I was a child . So I for sure think of myself as a Canadian already . I guess the only way to really explain it is to say that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ( Mikhail , Abbotsford , B.C. , 2004 ) . <p> Their cross-border migration experiences and residential decision making lend support to transnational theorists who maintain that international zones are increasingly fluid areas of contact and connectedness ( Appadurai 1991 ; Hyndman and Walton-Roberts 2000 ) . Not only do Russians and Ukrainians on both sides of the border share a religious belief system , they are also helping to create a Cascadia translocale  --  not unlike many other political borders in the world with transnational relationships involving capital , people , goods , and services . Meanwhile , the patterns and identities of other nonreligious migrs from the Russian Federation and Ukraine who settled in British Columbia as economic migrants reflect choosing similar heterolocal nodes in other parts of the region that are unrelated to religious institutions but near other ethnic networks of economic and-social support . This finding bears further study , for it appears that , even at a transnational , regional scale , processes much like those that shaped earlier ethnic , enclaves in downtown Chicago continue to shape immigrant settlement patterns in today 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a much larger scale . MOVING BEYOND HETEROLOCALISM ? <p> Based on the findings presented from this study of two related groups in a North American transborder region , examining the relationship between heterolocalism and transnationalism holds promise for studies by geographers and other scholars interested in ethnic identity and the spatial distribution patterns of foreign-born migrants . A number of questions remain to be pursued that build on Zelinsky 's initial foray into defining a new model of immigrant and refugee settlement : How do other factors , such as affordability of housing , the safety and security of neighborhoods , and the quality of public schools in particular areas influence the decision making of immigrants and refugees in North America ? What is the relationship between residential patterns and the places of work of foreign-born migrants ? How might heterolocal residential patterns help retard or accelerate the loss of ethnic identity in other case studies of nation-states with different immigration policies ? Additional studies of other nonwhite , foreign-born migrant groups are especially critical to sorting out racial influences on potential patterns of heterolocalism in other places , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is building on Zelinsky 's earlier work on the geography of religion in the United States and a more recent study by Laura Beattie and David Ley ( 2003 ) on the changingrole of immigrant churches in Vancouver . Their research opened the door to a renewed sense of urgency for additional studies of religious geography that " see religious landscape forms ( or map distributions ) not as unproblematic social facts but as social constructions embodying meanings to be revealed through hermeneutic method , meanings that both create landscapes and also perpetuate existing cultural values and social and political relationships " ( Beattie and Ley 2003 , 3 ) . My ongoing research on Russian and Ukrainian Christians in the Pacific Northwest provides one example of synthesizing some of the classic work on the geography of immigration , ethnic identity , and religion , with attention to more recent social theories and social relationships . As Beattie and Ley ( 2003 ) found , the immigrant church once served as the primary institution expressing immigrant needs and values . However , as the children of immigrants acculturate and move away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Religious networks can play a major role in locational decision making and the related social processes of immigrants and refugees . Membership and active participation in church congregations on the American side of the United States  --  Canadian border continue to play a key role in determining where Russians and Ukrainians in British Columbia live and work . Their attachment to these emotional , spiritual , and symbolic sites of ethnic identity not only help define their places of residence but also contribute to group cohesiveness and identity . As Ley reminds us , " emotional sites may be in geographically distant places , so that people live a kind of polycenteredness , requiring multiple site ethnographies " ( 2004,155 ) . As such , these religious sites as symbolic spaces blur national boundaries and help bond religious and ethnic identities . Religious networks , ties , and relationships help shape migration decision making and ethnic identity all along the migration circuit from homeland to new sites of residence , despite differences in the politics of place in Canada and the United States and in politically determined definitions of " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This study establishes that , despite the transborder zone of difference , relationships between refugees and immigrants who share a religious and ethnic identity exist across a variety of scales , ranging from local , to regional , to national , to transnational . <p> Many additional research questions about the changing role of immigrant and refugee religious networks and nodes at the transnational scale remain . How will changing affiliations with Russian and Ukrainian churches in the United States and Canada affect the residential patterns and the shifting ethnic identities of these and other groups in the future ? A great deal of further evidence remains to be gathered and analyzed in other places with other immigrant groups in order to test Wilbur Zelinsky 's and other scholars ' ideas and , ultimately , to understand the ever-changing new geography of immigration in the twenty-first century .
