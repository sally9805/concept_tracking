A promo that ran last week on Los Angeles ' 93.1 Jack FM consisted of a real caller yelling into the station 's voice mail that he hated the station so much , it made him want to stick a hot poker in his ears . A few weeks earlier , in New York City , an angry Mayor Michael Bloomberg said a very bad word because 101.1 Jack FM replaced his beloved oldies station . ( You 'd think the guy could afford a satellite radio . ) Steven Van Zandt of Bruce Springsteen 's E Street Band said it was like replacing the Statue of Liberty with a blow-up doll , which he meant as a negative . <P> All that passion is being aroused , oddly , by possibly the catchiest , most democratic radio format yet invented . Jack mixes up a lot of ' 80s music  --  some classic rock , a slew of one-hit wonders , a few oldies , a touch of Top 40 and a tiny bit of rap . It has surgically removed everything that is annoying about radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no weather , no traffic , no song IDs  --  and is completely automated , so there are n't even any wrongheaded DJs to endure . At 1,200 songs , the playlists are three times bigger than average , so it does n't grate with repetitiveness , and the commercial breaks are noticeably shorter . If families still sat around the radio in happy little nuclear units , they would spend the night rocking out to Jack . In the year since it was introduced in the U.S. , Jack radio has spread to 17 stations and spawned such copycats as Bob FM and Dave FM and has invented a format so widespread , it already has a name : variety hits . No concept has overtaken the nation 's dials so successfully since the morning zoo hit in the early ' 80s . <P> So why does Jack inspire all the bile ? It 's not as if it were one of those seemingly hipster products that was actually created after much consumer testing by a conglomerate . Jack has a lovable indie backstory , starting out as one guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former DJ and station manager who had moved to Connecticut to be near his wife 's aging parents , started fooling around with Internet radio . He got some cheap software that allowed him to randomize song order , causing " train wrecks "  --  ballads followed by headbangers . He put it up as jack.fm and slid in some promos revolving around a fictitious cowboy named Jack who made fun of the DJ clichs he had heard his whole life . " I started ripping in music and said , This is cool , and this is different , " says Perry , 45 . " We said we could probably sell this to some little AM station somewhere . " <P> Instead in 2002 he sold it to an FM station in Vancouver , where it got so huge , it quickly was bought by five other Canadian stations ; in April of last year , a station in Denver bought in , and Jack metastasized . Former Vancouver DJ Howie ( the Hitman ) Cogan , who voices most of Jack 's taped promos , is now repped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station consultant . " My involvement with Jack now is , ' Oh , look , the check just came in , ' " he says .
