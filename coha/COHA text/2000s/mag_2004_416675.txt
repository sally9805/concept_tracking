See also additional image in Table of Contents of same issue Movie buffs looking to build a home theater typically have four choices : traditional CRT sets , LCD displays , plasma screens and hulking rear-projection units . Some are five-digit expensive , some so heavy that it takes three linebackers to carry them into the house , and some lose brightness from any viewpoint but a small sweet spot directly in front . Even the most gigantic offer an image no bigger than about 6 feet diagonally . But conspicuously absent from this list of usual suspects is a semisecret but spectacular setup with a vastly bigger display that is often higher-resolution and less expensive than the plug-and-play boxes . It 's called front projection . I installed one in our bedroom , and the projected image is 8 feet diagonally and better than the local multiplex . Best of all , I 'm in the theater business for under $5,000 . Tickets $5 before 6 p.m. , popcorn on demand . These systems are built around powerful digital projectors of the kind originally developed to blast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chips capable of HDTV quality . So why does n't everybody have one ? Because it 's not plug-and-play . Setting up one of these systems requires a little carpentry ( projectors are typically hung from the ceiling ) and a little understanding of such things as why a trio of red , green and blue video jacks are labeled Y , PbCB and PrCR . Oh , and a spouse who can tolerate some inevitably exposed wiring . The Denon AVR-2803 receiver I used for my setup had 18 speaker posts  --  plus another 90 jacks , receptacles , connectors and terminals . So it 's not surprising that at first pass I wound up with rear-speaker sound out of the fronts and nothing out of the rears . ( " They 're not rears , " the tech rep told me when I phoned , desperate . " They 're surrounds . " ) While a video nerd could do it in an hour , the whole setup took me closer to 25 . But when I finally slid in a DVD and got a bright , sharp picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound where there had been but squawks , it was an epiphany . Hobbits were bigger than life-size , I could practically feel Seabiscuit underneath me , and Salma Hayek in Frida was ... well , let 's just say it was worth all the effort .

Screen  --  If your projector will sit on a table , use a retro-reflective screen . If it will be ceiling-mounted , use a reflective screen .  --  For the best image , use a screen that is pasted to the wall ( like wallpaper ) or has a frame to keep it taut , instead of a roll-up screen .  --  You can skip the screen and just project onto a neutral gray wall , but your image will not be as bright as it would be on a screen . Speakers  --  Mount the center-channel speaker above or below the screen  --  both spots produce similar sound . Or , for the most realistic audio , get a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put the center channel behind the screen .  --  Place rear ( surround ) speakers above ear level , either on the sides pointed toward the listener or facing forward behind the listener .
