Chapter 1 If the bodies were there , I could n't find them . Outside , the wind howled . Inside the old church , just the scrape of my trowel and the hum of a portable generator and heater echoed eerily in the huge space . High above , branches scratched against boarded windows , gnarled fingers on plywood blackboards . The group stood behind me , huddled but not touching , fingers curled tightly in pockets . I could hear the shifting from side to side , the lifting of one foot , then the other . Boots made a crunching sound on the frozen ground . No one spoke . The cold had numbed us into silence . I watched a cone of earth disappear through quarter-inch mesh as I spread it gently with my trowel . The granular subsoil had been a pleasant surprise . Given the surface , I had expected permafrost the entire depth of the excavation . The last two weeks had been unseasonably warm in Quebec , however , allowing snow to melt and ground to thaw . Typical Tempe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by another arctic blast , the mild spell had left the dirt soft and easy to dig . Good . Last night the temperature had dropped to seven degrees Fahrenheit . Not good . While the ground had not refrozen , the air was frigid . My fingers were so cold I could hardly bend them . We were digging our second trench . Still nothing but pebbles and rock fragments in the screen . I did n't anticipate much at this depth , but you could never tell . I 'd yet to do an exhumation that had gone as planned . I turned to a man in a black parka and a tuque on his head . He wore leather boots laced to the knee , two pairs of socks rolled over the tops . His face was the color of tomatosoup . " Just a few more inches . " I gave a palm-down gesture , like stroking a cat . Slowly . Go slowly . The man nodded , then thrust his long-handled spade into the shallow trench , grunting like Monica Seles on a first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grabbing the shovel . By inches ! I repeated the slicing motion I 'd been showing him all morning . " We want to take it down in thin layers . " I said it again , in slow , careful French . The man clearly did not share my sentiment . Maybe it was the tediousness of the task , maybe the thought of unearthing the dead . Tomato soup just wanted to be done and gone . " Please , Guy , try again ? " said a male voice behind me . " Yes , Father . " Mumbled . Guy resumed , shaking his head , but skimming the soil as I 'd shown him , then tossing it into the screen . I shifted my gaze from the black dirt to the pit itself , watching for signs that we were nearing a burial . We 'd been at it for hours , and I could sense tension behind me . The nuns ' rocking had increased in tempo . I turned to give the group what I hoped was a reassuring look . My lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faces looked back at me , pinched from cold and anxiousness . A small cloud of vapor appeared and dissolved in front of each . Six smiles in my direction . I could sense a lot of praying going on . Ninety minutes later we were five feet down . Like the first , this pit had produced only soil . I was certain I had frostbite in every toe , and Guy was ready to bring in a backhoe . Time to regroup . " Father , I think we need to check the burial records again . " He hesitated a moment . Then , " Yes . Of course . Of course . And we could all use coffee and a sandwich . " The priest started toward a set of wooden doors at the far end of the abandoned church and the nuns followed , heads down , gingerly navigating the lumpy ground . Their white veils spread in identical arcs across the backs of their black wool coats . Penguins . Who 'd said that ? The Blues Brothers . I turned off the mobile spotlights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed at the fragments of bone embedded in the dirt floor . Great . We 'd dug in the one spot in the entire church that did n't contain burials . Father Mnard pushed open one of the doors and , single file , we exited to daylight . Our eyes needed little adjustment . The sky was leaden and seemed to hug the spires and towers of all the buildings in the convent 's compound . A raw wind blew off the Laurentians , flapping collars and veils . Our little group bent against the wind and crossed to an adjacent building , gray stone like the church , but smaller . We climbed steps to an ornately carved wooden porch and entered through a side door . Inside , the air was warm and dry , pleasant after the bitter cold . I smelled tea and mothballs and years of fried food . Wordlessly , the women removed their boots , smiled at me one by one , and disappeared through a door-way to the right just as a tiny nun in an enormous ski sweater shuffled into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappeared beneath her veil . She blinked at me through thick lenses and reached for my parka . I hesitated , afraid its weight would tip her off balance and send her crashing to the tile . She nodded sharply and urged me with upturned fingertips , so I slipped the jacket off , laid it across her arms , and added cap and gloves . She was the oldest woman that I had ever seen still breathing . I followed Father Mnard down a long , poorly lit hallway into a small study . Here the air smelled of old paper and schoolhouse paste . A crucifix loomed over a desk so large I wondered how they 'd gotten it through the door . Dark oak paneling rose almost to the ceiling . Statues stared down from the room 's upper edge , faces somber as the figure on the crucifix . Father Mnard took one of two wooden chairs facing the desk , gestured me to the other . The swish of his cassock . The click of his beads . For a moment I was back at St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Stop it , Brennan . You 're over forty , a professional . A forensic anthropologist . These people called you because they need your expertise . The priest retrieved a leather-bound volume from the desktop , opened it to a page with a green ribbon marker , and positioned the book between us . He took a deep breath , pursed his lips , and exhaled through his nose . I was familiar with the diagram . A grid with rows divided into rectangular plots , some with numbers , some with names . We 'd spent hours poring over it the day before , comparing the descriptions and records for the graves with their positions on the grid . Then we 'd paced it all off , marking exact locations . Sister lisabeth Nicolet was supposed to be in the second row from the church 's north wall , third plot from the west end . Right next to Mother Aurlie . But she was n't . Nor was Aurlie where she should have been . I pointed to a grave in the same quadrant , but several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be there . " Then down the row . " And Agathe , Vronique , Clment , Marthe , and Elonore . Those are the burials from the 1840s , right ? " " C'est a . " I moved my finger to the portion of the diagram corresponding to the southwest corner of the church . " And these are the most recent graves . The markers we found are consistent with your records . " " Yes . Those were the last , just before the church was abandoned . " " It was closed in 1914 . " " Nineteen fourteen . Yes , 1914 . " He had an odd way of repeating words and phrases . " lisabeth died in 1888 ? " " C'est a , 1888 . Mre Aurlie in 1894 . " It did n't make sense . Evidence of the graves should be there . It was clear that artifacts from the 1840 burials remained . A test in that area had produced wood fragments and bits of coffin hardware . In the protected environment inside the church , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in pretty good shape . So where were lisabeth and Aurlie ? The old nun shuffled in with a tray of coffee and sandwiches . Steam from the mugs had fogged her glasses , so she moved with short , jerky steps , never lifting her feet from the floor . Father Mnard rose to take the tray . " Merci , Sister Bernard . This is very kind . Very kind . " The nun nodded and shuffled out , not bothering to clear her lenses . I watched her as I helped myself to coffee . Her shoulders were about as broad as my wrist . " How old is Sister Bernard ? " I asked , reaching for a croissant . Salmon salad and wilted lettuce . " We 're not exactly sure . She was at the convent when I first started coming here as a child , before the war . World War II , that is . Then she went to teach in the foreign missions . She was in Japan for a long time , then Cameroon . We think she 's in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slurper . " She was born in a small village in the Saguenay , says she joined the order when she was twelve . " Slurp . " Twelve . Records were n't so good in those days in rural Quebec . Not so good . " I took a bite of sandwich then rewrapped my fingers around the coffee mug . Delicious warmth . " Father , are there any other records ? Old letters , documents , anything we have n't looked at ? " I wriggled my toes . No sensation . He gestured to the papers littering the desk , shrugged . " This is everything Sister Julienne gave me . She is the convent archivist , you know . " " Yes . " Sister Julienne and I had spoken and corresponded at length . It was she who had initially contacted me about the project . I was intrigued from the outset . This case was very different from my usual forensic work involving the recently dead who end up with the coroner . The archdiocese wanted me to exhume and analyze the remains of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saint . But that was the point . lisabeth Nicolet had been proposed for beatification . I was to find her grave and verify that the bones were hers . The saint part was up to the Vatican . Sister Julienne had assured me that there were good records . All graves in the old church were cataloged and mapped . The last burial had taken place in 1911 . The church was abandoned and sealed in 1914 following a fire . A larger one was built to replace it , and the old building was never used again . Closed site . Good documentation . Piece of cake . So where was lisabeth Nicolet ? " It might not hurt to ask . Perhaps there 's something Sister Julienne did n't give you because she thought it unimportant . " He started to say something , changed his mind . " I 'm quite sure she 's given me everything , but I 'll ask . Sister Julienne has spent a great deal of time researching this . A great deal . " I watched him out the door , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs , tucked my feet under me , and rubbed my toes . Good . Feeling was returning . Sipping my coffee , I lifted a letter from the desk . I 'd read it before . August 4 , 1885 . Smallpox was out of control in Montreal . lisabeth Nicolet had written to Bishop douard Fabre , pleading that he order vaccinations for parishioners who were well , and use of the civic hospital by those who were infected . The handwriting was precise , the French quaint and outdated . The Convent Notre-Dame de l'Immacule-Conception was absolutely silent . My mind drifted . I thought of other exhumations . The policeman in St-Gabriel . In that cemetery the coffins had been stacked three deep . We 'd finally found Monsieur Beaupr four graves from his recorded location , bottom position , not top . And there was the man in Winston-Salem who was n't in his own coffin . The occupant was a woman in a long floral dress . That had left the cemetery with a double problem . Where was the deceased ? And who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to rebury Grandpa in Poland , and the lawyers were girding for war when I left . Far off , I heard a bell toll , then , in the corridor , shuffling . The old nun was heading my way . " Serviettes , " she screeched . I jumped , rocketing coffee onto my sleeve . How could so much volume come from so small a person ? " Merci . " I reached for the napkins . She ignored me , closed in , and began scrubbing my sleeve . A tiny hearing aid peeked from her right ear . I could feel her breath and see fine white hairs ringing her chin . She smelled of wool and rose water . " Eh , voil . Wash it when you get home . Cold water . " " Yes , Sister . " Reflex . Her eyes fell on the letter in my hand . Fortunately , it was coffee-free . She bent close . " lisabeth Nicolet was a great woman . A woman of God . Such purity . Such austerity . " Puret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's letters would if spoken . " Yes , Sister . " I was nine years old again . " She will be a saint . " " Yes , Sister . That 's why we 're trying to find her bones . So they can receive proper treatment . " I was n't sure just what proper treatment was for a saint , but it sounded right . I pulled out the diagram and showed it to her . " This is the old church . " I traced the row along the north wall , and pointed to a rectangle . " This is her grave . " The old nun studied the grid for a very long time , lenses millimeters from the page . " She 's not there , " she boomed . " Excuse me ? " " She 's not there . " A knobby finger tapped the rectangle . " That 's the wrong place . " Father Mnard returned at that moment . With him was a tall nun with heavy black eyebrows that angled together above her nose . The priest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was n't necessary to explain what Sister Bernard had said . Undoubtedly they 'd heard the old woman while in the corridor . They 'd probably heard her in Ottawa . " That 's the wrong place . You 're looking in the wrong place , " she repeated . " What do you mean ? " asked Sister Julienne . " They 're looking in the wrong place , " she repeated . " She 's not there . " Father Mnard and I exchanged glances . " Where is she , Sister ? " I asked . She bent to the diagram once again , then jabbed her finger at the southeast corner of the church . " She 's there . With Mre Aurlie . " " But , Sis  --  " " They moved them . Gave them new coffins and put them under a special altar . There . " Again she pointed at the southeast corner . " When ? " we asked simultaneously . Sister Bernard closed her eyes . The wrinkled old lips moved in silent calculation . " Nineteen eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I remember , because a few years later the church burned and they boarded it up . It was my job to go in and put flowers on their altar . I did n't like that . Spooky to go in there all alone . But I offered it up to God . " " What happened to the altar ? " " Taken out sometime in the thirties . It 's in the Holy Infant Chapel in the new church now . " She folded the napkin and began gathering coffee things . " There was a plaque marking those graves , but not anymore . No one goes in there now . Plaque 's been gone for years . Father Mnard and I looked at each other . He gave a slight shrug . " Sister , " I began , " do you think you could show us where lisabeth 's grave is ? " " Bien sr . " " Now ? " " Why not ? " China rattled against china . " Never mind the dishes , " said Father Mnard . " Please , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll walk over . " Ten minutes later we were all back in the old church . The weather had not improved and , if anything , was colder and damper than in the morning . The wind still howled . The branches still tapped . Sister Bernard picked an unsteady path across the church , Father Mnard and I each gripping an arm . Through the layers of clothing , she felt brittle and weightless . The nuns followed in their spectator gaggle , Sister Julienne ready with steno pad and pen . Guy hung to the rear . Sister Bernard stopped outside a recess in the southeast corner . She 'd added a hand-knitted chartreuse hat over her veil , tied under her chin . We watched her head turn this way and that , searching for markers , getting her bearings . All eyes focused on the one spot of color in the dreary church interior . I signaled to Guy to reposition a light . Sister Bernard paid no attention . After some time she moved back from the wall . Head left , head right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her position once more , then gouged a line in the dirt with the heel of her boot . Or tried to . " She 's here . " The shrill voice echoed off stone walls . " You 're sure ? " " She 's here . " Sister Bernard did not lack self-assurance . We all looked at the mark she 'd made . " They 're in little coffins . Not like regular ones . They were just bones , so everything fit into small coffins . " She held her tiny arms out to indicate a child-size dimension . An arm trembled . Guy focused the light on the spot at her feet . Father Mnard thanked the ancient nun and asked two of the sisters to help her back to the convent . I watched their retreat . She looked like a child between them , so small that the hem of her coat barely cleared the dirt floor . I asked Guy to bring the other spotlight to the new location . Then I retrieved my probe from the earlier site , positioned the tip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-bar handle . No go . This spot was less defrosted . I was using a tile probe to avoid damaging anything underground , and the ball-shaped tip did not pass easily through the partially frozen upper layer . I tried again , harder . Easy , Brennan . They wo n't be happy if you shatter a coffin window . Or poke a hole through the good sister 's skull . I removed my gloves , wrapped my fingers around the T-bar , and thrust again . This time the surface broke , and I felt the probe slide into the subsoil . Suppressing the urge to hurry , I tested the earth , eyes closed , feeling for minute differences in texture . Less resistance could mean an airspace where something had decomposed . More could mean that a bone or artifact was present underground . Nothing . I withdrew the probe and repeated the process . On the third try I felt resistance . I withdrew , reinserted six inches to the right . Again , contact . There was something solid not far below the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked Guy to bring the screen . Laying aside the probe , I took up a flat-edged shovel and began to strip thin slices of earth . I peeled soil , inch by inch , tossing it into the screen , my eyes moving from the fill to the pit . Within thirty minutes I saw what I was looking for . The last few tosses were dark , black against the red-brown dirt in the screen . I switched from shovel to trowel , bent into the pit , and carefully scraped the floor , removing loose particles and leveling the surface . Almost immediately I could see a dark oval . The stain looked about three feet long . I could only guess at its width since it lay half hidden under unexcavated soil . " There 's something here , " I said , straightening . My breath hung in front of my face . As one , the nuns and priest moved closer and peered into the pit . I outlined the oval with my trowel tip . At that moment Sister Bernard 's escort nuns rejoined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though it looks rather small . I 've dug a bit to the left , so I 'll have to take this portion down . " I indicated the spot where I was squatting . " I 'll excavate outside the grave itself and work my way down and in . That way we 'll have a profile view of the burial as we go . And it 's easier on the back to dig that way . An outside trench will also allow us to remove the coffin from the side if we have to . " " What is the stain ? " asked a young nun with a face like a Girl Scout . " When something with a high organic content decays , it leaves the soil much darker . It could be from the wooden coffin , or flowers that were buried with it . " I did n't want to explain the decomposition process . " Staining is almost always the first sign of a burial . " Two of the nuns crossed themselves . " Is it thsabeth or Mre Aurlie ? " asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little dance . I raised my hands in a " beats me " gesture . Pulling on my gloves , I started troweling the soil over the right half of the stain , expanding the pit outward to expose the oval and a two-foot strip along its right . Again , the only sounds were scraping and screening . Then , " Is that something ? " The tallest of the nuns pointed to the screen . I rose to look , grateful for an excuse to stretch . The nun was indicating a small , reddish-brown fragment . " You bet your a  --  . That sure is , Sister . Looks like coffin wood . " I got a stack of paper bags from my supplies , marked one with the date , location , and other pertinent information , set it in the screen , and laid the others on the ground . My fingers were now completely numb . " Time to work , ladies . Sister Julienne , you record everything we find . Write it on the bag , and enter it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  --  I looked into the pit  --  " about the two-foot level . Sister Marguerite , you 're going to shoot some pictures ? " Sister Marguerite nodded , held up her camera . They flew into action , eager after the long hours of watching . I troweled , Sisters Eyelid and Girl Scout screened . More and more fragments appeared , and before long we could see an outline in the stained soil . Wood . Badly deteriorated . Not good . Using my trowel and bare hands , I continued to uncover what I hoped was a coffin . Though the temperature was below freezing and all feeling had left my fingers and toes , inside my parka I sweated . Please let this be her , I thought . Now who was praying ? As I inched the pit northward , exposing more and more wood , the object expanded in breadth . Slowly , the contour emerged : hexagonal . Coffin shape . It took some effort not to shout " Hallelujah ! " Churchy , but unprofessional , I told myself . I teased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the object was fully exposed . It was a small casket , and I was moving from the foot toward the head . I put down my trowel and reached for a paintbrush . My eyes met those of one of my screeners . I smiled . She smiled . Her right lid did a jitterbug . I brushed the wooden surface again and again , teasing away decades of encrusted soil . Everyone stopped to watch . Gradually , a raised object emerged on the coffin lid . Just above the widest point . Exactly where a plaque would be . My heart did its own fast dance . I brushed dirt from the object until it came into focus . It was oval , metallic , with a filigreed edge . Using a toothbrush , I gently cleaned its surface . Letters emerged . " Sister , could you hand me my flashlight ? From the pack ? " Again , they leaned in as one . Penguins at a watering spot . I shone the beam onto the plaque . " thsabeth Nicolet  --  1846-1888 . Femme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said to no one in particular . " Hallelujah ! " shouted Sister Girl Scout . So much for church etiquette . For the next two hours we exhumed lisabeth 's remains . The nuns , and even Father Mnard , threw themselves into the task like undergraduates on their first dig . Habits and cassock swirled around me as dirt was screened , bags were filled , labeled , and stacked , and the whole process was captured on film . Guy helped , though still reluctant . It was as odd a crew as I 've ever directed . Removing the casket was not easy . Though it was small , the wood was badly damaged and the coffin interior had filled with dirt , increasing the weight to about ten tons . The side trench had been a good call , though I 'd underestimated the space we 'd need . We had to expand outward by two feet to allow plywood to slide under the coffin . Eventually , we were able to raise the whole assemblage using woven polypropylene rope . By five-thirty we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , toes , and faces thawing. thsabeth Nicolet and her casket were locked in the back of the archdiocese van , along with my equipment . Tomorrow , Guy would drive her to the Laboratoire de Mdecine Lgale in Montreal , where I work as Forensic Anthropologist for the Province of Quebec . Since the historic dead do not qualify as forensic cases , special permission had been obtained from the Bureau du Coroner to perform the analysis there . I would have two weeks with the bones . I set down my cup and said my good-byes . Again . The sisters thanked me , again , smiling through tense faces , nervous already about my findings . They were great smilers . Father Mnard walked me to my car . It had grown dark and a light snow was falling . The flakes felt strangely hot against my cheeks . The priest asked once more if I would n't prefer to overnight at the convent . The snow sparkled behind him as it drifted in the porch light . Again , I declined . A few last road directions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the two-lane and I began to regret my decision . The flakes that had floated lazily in my headlights were now slicing across in a steady diagonal curtain . The road and the trees to either side were covered by a membrane of white that was growing more opaque by the second . I clutched the wheel with both hands , palms clammy inside my gloves . I slowed to forty . Thirty-five . Every few minutes I tested the brakes . While I have been living in Quebec off and on for years , I have never grown accustomed to winter driving . I think of myself as tough , but put me on wheels in snow and I am Princess Chickenheart . I still have the typical Southern reaction to winter storms . Oh . Snow . Then we wo n't be going out , of course . Les qubcois look at me and laugh . Fear has a redeeming quality . It drives away fatigue . Tired as I was , I stayed alert , teeth clenched , neck craned , muscles rigid . The Eastern Townships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but not much . Lac Memphrmagog to Montreal is normally a two-hour drive . It took me almost four . Shortly after ten , I stood in the dark of my apartment , exhausted , glad to be home . Quebec home . I 'd been away in North Carolina almost two months . Bienvenue . My thought process had already shifted to French . I turned up the heat and checked the refrigerator . Bleak . I microzapped a frozen burrito and washed it down with room temperature root beer . Not haute cuisine , but filling . The luggage I 'd dropped off Tuesday night sat unopened in the bedroom . I did n't consider unpacking . Tomorrow . I fell into bed , planning to sleep at least nine hours . The phone woke me in less than four . " Oui , yes , " I mumbled , the linguistic transition now in limbo . " Temperance . It is Pierre LaManche . I am very sorry to disturb you at this hour . " I waited . In the seven years I 'd worked for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the morning . " I hope things went well at Lac Memphrmagog . " He cleared his throat . " I have just had a call from the coroner 's office . There is a house fire in St-Jovite . The firefighters are still trying to get it under control . The arson investigators will go in first thing in the morning , and the coroner wants us there . " Again the throat . " A neighbor says the residents are at home . Their cars are in the driveway . " " Why do you need me ? " I asked in English . " Apparently the fire is extremely intense . If there are bodies , they will be badly burned . Perhaps reduced to calcined bone and teeth . It could be a difficult recovery . " Damn . Not tomorrow . " What time ? " " I will come for you at six A.M. ? " " O.K. " " Temperance . It could be a bad one . There were children living there . " I set the alarm for five-thirty . Bienvenue. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
