Every Wednesday for the past 11 years , Hacene Ferhati has stood outside the downtown offices of Algeria 's Human Rights Commission to wave a picture of his brother Moustapha at people driving by . <p> He never comes alone . On a recent morning , three dozen other middle-aged men and women stood by his side , each holding faded pictures of loved ones they say were " disappeared " by government security forces during the country 's decade-long civil war that killed as many as 200,000 in the 1990s . <p> All are members of SOS Disparus , an advocacy organization which has worked for over a decade on behalf of families to draw attention to the fate of those who vanished in the war , estimated at between 6,000 and 15,000 people . <p> The group accuses the government of President Abdelaziz Bouteflika , who recently won a third term in office , of refusing to investigate what happened to their missing relatives . Instead , they say , the state tries to harass them to stop their work on the issue and offers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give us money and then just close the case , but we do n't want their money , says Mr. Ferhati , whose brother disappeared in 1998 - two years after another brother died in the fighting . " We want to investigate what happened to our families . " <p> In a region that 's been wracked by internecine conflicts from Beirut to Baghdad , the question of how a divided society reconciles after years spent peering into the abyss is an emotionally explosive one . Algeria 's efforts to find an answer have been fitful , pitting the nation 's desire to forget its troubled past against a group of families who can not let go . <p> In 2005 , the country passed a National Reconciliation Charter with the approval of a reported 97 percent of the electorate . The controversial document ended the fighting between the state and Islamist militants by granting amnesty to almost all fighters on both sides . <p> It also offered financial compensation to the families of those disappeared in the war , but also made it illegal to criticize government conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future investigations . <p> Supporters of the charter say that for Algeria to move forward , it must forget its past . But men like Ferhati are the spoilers of that vision . He says the charter gives impunity to human rights violators and robs families of their right to know the truth about their loved ones final days . <p> " In conflicts all around the world , there are victims and there are perpetrators , " says Ferhati . " We need to know who is who , and only then can we start reconciling with each other . " <p> Families seek truth before reconciliation <p> Human Rights Watch criticized the referendum on the National Reconciliation Charter , saying Mr. Bouteflika campaigned for it " on the theme that those who opposed it were the enemies of peace and reconciliation . " But despite the criticism , the accord is clearly popular . For most Algerians , the highest political priority is making sure that peace is here to stay . <p> In order to do that , the charter emphasizes that Algerians are more alike than different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa program for the International Crisis Group . It is a much-appreciated corrective to " the identity politics that led to the violence of the 1990s . " <p> " Bouteflika ' s national reconciliation discourse says , ' We are all Arabs and Berbers and Muslims - we are all Algerian and we should n't let our differences tear us apart , ' " he says . <p> " It is a positive discourse , but there is a negative element as well that says , in effect , ' We should turn the page and not seek explanations of what happened and why , " he says . " But the families of those who lost someone want to know why . They want to know the truth . " <p> Relatives want facts <p> Naseera Dutour helped found SOS Disparus after the disappearance of her 21-year-old son , Amin . She says she learned from a friend who worked as a police officer that Amin was being held in a police station in the Algiers suburb of Barake . The friend urged her to do whatever she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " He told me : ' If you are very powerful you can get your son out of their hands , but if you do n't get him out soon next week they will take him someplace where you will never find him , ' " she says . <p> At the station the police chief denied her son was there , so she went home empty-handed . She has never seen or heard from Amin since . <p> " I made a mistake , " she says , her voice trailing off . " I should have insisted . " <p> For Dutour , it is obvious who took her son . She says the legal protections provided to the state in the Reconciliation Charter make it even clearer . <p> Under Article 45 of the charter , individuals are forbidden from filing complaints against the government , police , or military for their conduct during the war . Those who do , face a five-year prison term and a fine as high as $33,000 . <p> " They say it tarnishes the image of Algeria , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . The state only wants to protect itself . " <p> ' Waste of time to investigate <p> Noureddine Benbraham is a member of parliament from the Rally for National Democracy , a party allied with Bouteflika , and the president of the Boy Scouts of Algeria . <p> He says that the civil war was " a complex situation , " and adds that many of the disappearances may have been the work of pro-government paramilitaries . <p> " Anyone could have been a policemen then - just put on a uniform and set up a checkpoint , " he says . " It was like a game . " <p> He calls the idea of an investigation into the disappearances " a waste of time , " and says families should focus on redeeming government compensation . Under the accord , they can choose between an average lump sum of $14,000 to $19,000 or a monthly stipend of $290 . <p> " Going down that road will not lead to anything good , " he says of an investigation . " No one knows who took those people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of information is the hardest part , and in its absence rumors fly . <p> Nateche Liamine , whose son Mohamed disappeared over a decade ago at age 16 , is convinced he is still alive and held in a secret prison . She has also heard rumors that police held some young men until they grew a beard - a sign of Islamist beliefs - and then killed them to inflate the terrorist body count . <p> The Monitor was unable to find any evidence that substantiated those rumors , but analysts say they nonetheless illustrate a vacuum that needs to be filled with the facts that only an investigation can yield . <p> " There were many extrajudicial arrests and executions during the war so it is very possible that these people were killed , " says Feisal Mettaoui , a journalist with the French daily El Watan . " But until the government provides some evidence of what happened to them , people will think that anything could have happened . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2009 .
