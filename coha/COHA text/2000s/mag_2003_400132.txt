Toilet World // Ivividly remember the last time I used a public restroom alone . It was in 1985 . We were on our way back home to Madison , Wisconsin , after visiting my husband Dave 's parents in Benton Harbor , Michigan . We stopped at a shopping mall halfway in between to grab a bite to eat , use the restroom , and give Jamie ( ten ) and Andy ( eight ) a chance to walk around . Jamie and I went to check out the girl 's department at Lord &; Taylor and then decided to visit the women s room . I followed Jamie in my little threewheeled scooter . She went into a regular stall and I went into the one designed to accommodate a wheelchair . I had no trouble getting onto the commode , but when I tried to stand up afterwards , I could n't . I panicked . What was I going to do ? Not this problem now ! Not another humiliating MS experience . Fighting back the tears , I tried to get a grip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't get up . I needed help . Dave would rescue me and I 'd deal with this new problem later . Jamie left me in the stall and went to find Dave to tell him what had happened . I sat on the commode waiting for them and trying desperately not to cry hysterically . When Dave and Jamie came back , Jamie checked to be sure the restroom was empty , crawled underneath my stall door and unlocked it . Then she stood guard at the entrance while Dave came inside to help me . In a matter of minutes we were out . No one in the store knew what had happened . But I did . That night , I cried myself to sleep because I knew I had lost another piece of independence forever . It 's been more than 17 years since that incident , and I have n't used a public restroom without help since that day . The challenge of finding a unisex restroom ( otherwise known as a single toilet room that can be locked for privacy ) is part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those who have the same problem or who worry that they might in the future . I recommend three steps first . 1 . Cry . Cry until you ca n't cry anymore . I cried for a week . I had to grieve this new loss . I also cried because I did n't know how I would manage . How would Dave and I leave the house for any length of time ? How much worse would I get ? Would it ever stop ? 2 . Assess the situation . When I had no more tears left , I asked myself what I was going to do . Was I going to be confined to short excursions , tethered to my home bathroom , or was I going to figure out a solution ? When I finally had the strength , I talked to Dave . 3 . Enlist allies . Dave insisted that he did n't want me to stay home all the time . He wanted me to be part of family activities . The kids were young and they needed me to be there at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dave said he was willing to help . He had just one request . He did n't want to go into a public woman 's restroom unless it was empty and someone was guarding the entrance . Okay ... I felt I could live with that . From then on , our search began ... and here 's what we 've learned . First , " building accessibility " and " restroom accessibility " are not synonymous . We both remember a trip to Maryland when we called to see if the restaurant was accessible but did n't ask about the restrooms . As we walked in , we saw a sign indicating that restrooms were in the basement . The manager assured us that we could use the " dumb waiter " to get downstairs . Now when we go to a restaurant we 've never been to before , we ask both accessibility questions ahead of time . Gas stations everywhere , both in the U.S. and abroad , have individual restrooms that are usually accessible . We stopped at one gas station restroom in Germany that had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soap dish , and fingertip towels on the rack . We thought we were in someone 's home . Recently , we 've discovered that convenfence stores that sell gasoline , and many national chains , such as Subway , Starbucks , and Einstein Bros . Bagels , have large accessible restrooms. // MARY 'S WORLD // At theme parks , zoos , museums , state fairs , and art fairs , we 've used the first-aid station or the nursery/mother 's room , designed for feeding or changing a baby . Some public facilities have locked first-aid stations that can be opened only by a security guard . Do n't be afraid to ask ! We 've found that guards will open the door even if all you need to do is use the restroom facilities . At the Kennedy Space Center , we used the employees ' restroom , which proved to us that sometimes you have to be creative and push the issue a little . Yes , explaining my problem to the young men and women who were working that day was a bit embarrassing-but I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . At some shopping centers , we 've used restrooms that were closed for cleaning . Sometimes we even put up our own sign . We carry one along that reads , " Restroom Temporarily Closed . " At malls with restrooms that are so busy they would be difficult to block off , I 'll ask a clerk at one of the stores if they have an employees ' restroom I could use . Occasionally they 'll say no ... until I explain why . We 've found that clerks and managers are willing to allow Dave and me into their backroom areas . Managers often apologize for the behind-the-scenes mess , but I enjoy the sneak-peek at the merchandise . At office buildings , exposition centers , and auditoriums , we 've asked a maintenance worker , security guard , or even a friendly-looking passer-by to stand guard while Dave helps me . Airports have offered us some of our most interesting experiences . Before the Baltimore/Washington airport built a state-of-the-art unisex restroom on the C Concourse , we used the police detention center . Of course we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would let us enter the bulletproof area . A few years ago we were at New York City 's JFK International , leaving on a midnight flight to Israel , and I needed a restroom before we boarded . There were no unisex facilities . A helpful employee suggested we go into the International Customs Center , which was closed at that hour . Dave and I were all alone at 10:30 p.m. in this large , restricted area . It was dark and sinister . But we found what we needed . Airports in Milwaukee , Nashville , Detroit , Tampa , Seattle/Tacoma and Madison , Wisconsin , all have unisex facilities that I 've used . At Chicago 's O'Hare , I 've used the Medical Center restroom . The first time we were there , we discovered that the handles on the sink were missing . When we asked why , we were told that people who are being tested for drugs try to dilute their urine samples . Now we always ask for the sink handles before we go in . We 've learned to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a facility for us . Sometimes , an isolated part of the building has a public restroom that 's rarely used . We found an out-of-the-way restroom on the top floor of a Chicago museum , for example . We 've also found that the world is filled with kind people . I try to remember that by asking for help from passers-by , employees , or business owners , we are educating people . Brookfield Square , a favorite shopping mall outside of Milwaukee , recently put in a " Family Restroom " -a large room with a sink , a toilet , and a lockable door . If those of us who search for a unisex restroom speak up about it , perhaps the next time a building is remodeled , or a building code is up for a vote , more people will remember us .
