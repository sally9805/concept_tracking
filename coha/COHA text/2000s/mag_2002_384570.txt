Constance Rossum , above , contends that her son-in-law killed himself . But last summer , her daughter , Kristin , rigs was accused of poisoning him and jailed . Photograph // Kristin Rossum is young , bright , and beautiful . She 's also been charged with murder . In this exclusive interview , Constance Rossum , mother of the accused , tells her daughter 's side of the story . By Joanna Powell Last October , Kristin Rossum spent her 25th birthday in solitary confinement at a San Diego jail . To mark the day , she got special permission to receive Holy Communion from her Episcopal priest in a nearby visiting room . Her parents , both distinguished college professors , were limited to their 30-minute weekly visit ; separated from their daughter by bulletproof glass , they communicated with her via telephone . To those who knew the defendant before her arrest last June , these were the latest in a series of unimaginable events . A petite , blond biochemist , Kristin Rossum is not your usual murder suspect . Prior to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman worked as a toxicologist for the San Diego County Medical Examiner 's office . But now she stands accused of poisoning 26-year-old Gregory T. de Villers , at their La Jolla , California , apartment on November 6 , 2000 . Her trial is scheduled to start in June . De Villers 's death was originally ruled a suicide , but after an eight  --  month investigation , Kristin was charged with his murder . Last July , at her arraignment , she pleaded not guilty and was jailed without bail . Since then , friends and family have insisted she 's innocent , even as the Deputy District Attorney depicts her as a cheating , drug-abusing wife capable of cold-blooded murder . As we went to press , a judge had finally approved bail , and Kristin was set to be released on a $1.25 million bond . The details of the case have unfolded like a Hollywood thriller . At about nine on the night Greg de Villers died , Kristin called 911 saying she could n't wake her husband and he was cold and pale . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Red rose petals were found around his body-evoking the movie American Beauty . The cause of death was ultimately ruled " acute intoxication " from the little-known drug fentanyl , a painkilling opiate far more powerful than morphine . Kristin admitted to police that she and her husband had been having marital problems and that she 'd told him she was leaving him . Kristin also admitted she was having an affair with her supervisor at the medical examiner 's office . And she volunteered that she had recently resumed using methamphetamine ( also known as crystal meth ) , which she had abused in high school . Finally , she told police that during their arguments , her husband had threatened to tell her employers about the affair and the illegal drug use . That threat , according to Deputy District Attorney Dan Goldstein , was the motive for Kristin to " tragically murder " her husband . The prosecution alleges that she poisoned him with a lethal dose of fentanyl , which she stole from the medical examiner 's office , believing she could get away with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TO KRISTIN 'S PARENTS , CONSTANCE and Ralph Rossum , and brothers , Pierce , 16 , and Brent , 22 , Kristin herself is a victim-caught in a tangle of circumstantial evidence and untruths spread by her late husband 's family . ( Greg de Villers was the son of a French count , Yves Tremolet de Villers , who worked as a plastic surgeon in Monaco and Los Angeles , with a client list that once included Princess Grace . ) The Rossums , now battling to save their daughter , claim that their side of the story has not been heard and that they have evidence that could exonerate Kristin . " Most of what people read in the newspaper is entirely from the prosecution 's perspective , " says Constance , director of a graduate program in nonprofits at Azuza Pacific University , in California . Some of the key points in the prosecution 's argument involve the accessibility of fentanyl , which is used primarily by anesthesiologists and by doctors treating cancer patients . The prosecutor points to an inventory of the medicine closet at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supply of fentanyl turned up missing . He has maintained that Kristin was in charge of a log monitoring the drug closet and was thereby able to make off with the substance . But the Rossums insist that Kristin was one of at least 30 employees who had access to the drug locker-along with their spouses , friends , and anyone who came into the office with an employee . " It was an honor system , " Constance maintains . " Anyone who was in the building could get into the drug area . " The inventory also showed some fentanyl patches missing from the office , which the prosecution initially said Kristin could have used to poison her husband . But her father , Ralph Rossum , Ph.D. , a constitutional law professor at Claremont McKenna College , in Claremont , California , who served in the Department of Justice during the Reagan administration , contends that the number of patches reported missing was too few to kill Greg . Photograph Greg and Kristin in 1998 , when they were dating : At first , her parents thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point , no one knows for sure how the fentanyl was administered to Greg . The drug is often injected . But the Rossum family maintains that the needle marks on Greg 's body have all been accounted for by the paramedics and emergency room staff who attempted to revive him . One possible explanation-which the defense will explore at the trial-involves an opaque glass of what looked like water sitting on the nightstand by the couple 's bed . " Fentanyl is colorless and odorless , " Constance says . " Greg could have taken it in the water . That glass sat there for two days while the police took pictures and searched the apartment .... They never tested the glass , " she charges . Kristin 's parents have been struggling to put on a brave face throughout this ordeal . " It 's so hard to see your daughter like this and be helpless to defend her , " says Constance , fighting back tears . " Kristin may have made some moral slips , but that does n't make her a murderess . " The courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy : Only two people know for sure what happened that night , and one of them is dead . Meanwhile , Constance Rossum is a mother consumed with loyalty and love for her troubled daughter . Recently , I met Constance at the Rossums ' home in Claremont to talk about what the media has dubbed the American Beauty case . GH : How does it feel as a mother knowing your daughter is awaiting trial for murder ? Constance Rossum : It 's always with you . If I have to give a lecture or make a presentation , I might forget for ten or 15 minutes . But I 'll see a young woman , a child , something will remind me of a moment in the past , and I get this wave of nausea . Ralph has described it as being repeatedly kicked in the stomach . We are angry , frustrated , and scared . This is like a living death for Kristin . She is 25 years old , and she could be buried alive in a cell for the next 75 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's case . Why have you decided to speak out ? Neither my husband nor I were ever contacted by the San Diego police , by the investigators , or by the prosecution before her arrest . Yet we were closely involved in Kristin 's and Greg lives for six years . We supported them financially and were the last people other than Kristin to see Greg alive I know you see a bias against Kristin that has been spread by the media . What do you think caused it ? There are a lot of inherently interesting elements to this story . Everybody wants to write a book or do a TV movie about it , so they are peddling photographs , making things up , and interviewing anybody who ever saw her walk the dog . It 's terrifying for us to see the misinformation that has been spread . One of the sensational elements in this case is that your daughter had a drug problem . Wo n't that behavior be damaging to her ? Kristin developed a problem with methamphetamine when she was in high school . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because she 'd had a serious dance injury , which was devastating to her as an aspiring ballerina . By the time she was 18 , she wanted to turn her life around so she left home and moved to San Diego to get away from the drug influence . That 's when she met Gregory Tremolet de Villers . The first day they met she told him she was trying to kick meth . He told her , " I know drugs , my father is a doctor . I 'll take care of you . " And they were together from then on . Photograph Golden girl : Kristin , above , in her high school graduation photo in 1994 , and , below , at age six // When we met Greg a few months later , we considered him our angel . He was bright , charming , and attractive . I could see he was totally in love with Kristin and wanted to protect her . She stopped taking the meth , worked very hard , went back to school to study biochemistry and physics . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't do laser research and high-powered physics if you 're doing drugs . But at the time of Greg 's death she had relapsed . Why ? It 's complicated . It happened in late October 2000 , when Kristin finally told Greg she was leaving him  --  and he refused to accept it . It muddies the picture . But it does n't change the story . The only reason the police , or anyone , knows about her drug problem is because she told them . Since she had never been arrested for drug use , there was no legal record . Another sticking point in the case is that Kristin was having an affair with Michael Robertson , her supervisor at the medical examiner 's office . When did you find out about that ? We did n't know about the affair until months after Greg 's death . And we were very disappointed when we found out . I think it 's terrible . But Kristin had decided the marriage was over in January of 2000 , seven months after they were married , and she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a separation . That was long before Kristin ever met Michael Robertson . Kristin 's intention was not to move from Greg to Michael . She wanted to build her own life . She was talking about graduate school at MIT , Stanford , or UCSD University of California , San Diego . She had graduated summa cum laude , Phi Beta Kappa from San Diego State and landed a good job . Her confidence was soaring as Greg became increasingly controlling and jealous . She respected Michael because he saw in her what Greg did n't . Where is Michael Robertson now ; He is back home in Australia . He is looking for work , and it 's been reported that he 's trying to reconcile with his wife . Even though Greg was distressed , he was still a smart young man with a bright future . Why would he kill himself ? Greg loved Kristin to the point of obsession . She was like his pretty prize . He wanted to marry her when they first met , but she was only 18 , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college first . We paid Kristin 's tuition and her rent , and Greg moved in with her over our objection . It was a five-year courtship . But the more she blossomed , the more obsessive he became . At first we were happy that a man was so head over heels about our daughter . But eventually we became concerned . Kristin 's best friend , who was supposed to be a bridesmaid , ( continued from page 132 ) felt she could n't stand up at the wedding because she was opposed to Kristin marrying Greg . He would n't even let them go to lunch together alone . My sister observed that he would literally follow Kristin from room to room . He told his superiors at work that he was n't going to travel on business because he did n't want to be without Kristin . He 'd say if Kristin loved him , she would n't want to go away either . Greg was immensely dependent on Kristin , and he was devastated that she was leaving him . And he realized he was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to be there . He 'd taken out large college loans . In addition , he now depended on Kristin to help support his mother . He was going berserk . But it was also important for him to keep up a facade . And so to the outside world , he let on nothing about his problems at home . What did you observe about Greg 's behavior in the months before his death ? There was a whole year of spiraling down . Once they were married , he went from charming to nervous and irritable . By the summer of 2000 , when we would call on weekends , she was usually crying , and he was in bed drawing inward . I said , " Kristin , do what you need to do . We 're here to support you . " She confided in her best friend that she was hoping to move out and began talking about renting a guest house owned by her friend 's mother . But in the midst of all this , Greg was keeping up the facade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and friends that he and Kristin were ready to have a baby and buy a house ! What happened on the Friday night when you last saw Greg ? There had been a week of trouble . Greg had been coming home , drinking , and staying in bed . Thursday night he found a love letter from Michael Robertson . Kristin tore it up , but Greg was intent on piecing it back together . When we arrived on Friday evening to take them to dinner-a joint celebration of their birthdays  --  we did n't know they had been arguing all week . But we could tell they were acting . It did n't feel real . Greg seemed agitated . Before dinner , I noticed a lovely red rose on the kitchen table . I said , " Oh , is n't that exquisite . " Kristin said that Costco had a sale on roses , so Greg had bought her a bouquet for her birthday . Suddenly Greg stood up in front of the table very dramatically and began gesturing and waxing poetic about the rose , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that single rose survived . " It was very strange . Later at the restaurant , he was drinking far more than usual . I asked him about his job . He began talking about how he wanted to get back at this friend of his , whom he had hired to do a marketing plan . Greg felt this guy had failed or betrayed him in some way . He ranted about his friend , saying he wanted to " ruin his life . " The evening ended so weirdly that Ralph and I went to a realtor on Saturday morning to look for a condo for Kristin . I was starting to be afraid for her . What does Kristin say happened between Friday night and Monday night when Greg stopped breathing ? On Saturday they continued to argue about her plans to leave . That night they grilled steaks that Kristin 's brothers had given them for their birthdays . Greg drank a combination of gin , wine , and beer , and threw up . He spent Sunday in bed and took several sedatives that evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his words , so Kristin called his office for him to say he was sick . Greg stayed in bed . She went to work , but came home to ( continued on page 136 ) ( continued from page 134 ) check on him several times that day . She was not particularly concerned because he 'd spent days in bed before . She spent the afternoon at work and came home around five to find him sleeping . She wrote him a note that started " Hi Sleepy , " and went on to say she was going to run some errands . She returned before eight and saw that Greg was still sleeping , so she took a long bath . About nine , dressed in pajamas for bed , she leaned over to kiss him good night and felt that he was cold and not breathing . That 's when she called 911 . The paramedics arrived about five minutes later and worked to revive him for 45 minutes . They took Greg to the hospital , where he was pronounced dead at 10:16 P.M. Photograph Constance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // When did she find the rose petals ? We have the tape of Kristin 's 911 call , which is excruciating . You hear her sobbing hysterically as the medical dispatcher tells her how to move him from the bed to the floor in order to administer CPR . When she pulls back the covers , you can hear the horror in her voice . That 's when she saw the scattered rose petals and also their framed wedding picture . It was that single rose he had gone on about on Friday night . And that was Greg 's suicide note . Some people question whether tearing up a rose is something a man would do . But Greg was theatrical and complex . It fits his personality . The death was ruled a suicide at first . But a few days later the San Diego police began an investigation after a call from Greg 's brother , Jerome de Villers . Why do you think Greg 's family pushed for an investigation ? The Tremolet de Villers family can not accept that Greg committed suitide or died accidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that they did n't know what was happening with Greg . He never let on that Kristin was about to leave him or that he was depressed . Perhaps the strongest argument the prosecution has made against Kristin is that she had a motive to kill her husband-that Greg was threatening to tell her employer about her affair and her drug abuse . Why do you discount that ? First of all , she told the police about the threats-that 's the only way they knew . If she had killed Greg , why would she have given them that information ? She shared it with the police to show his state of mind . She was finally going to leave him , and he threatened to turn her in if she did . Yes , it would have been embarrassing if he had told , but not that terrible . Kristin said to him : " I do n't care if you tell . I have other opportunities . My parents will help me out . I want to go back to school . I have leads on new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew he had nothing to keep her from going . He left her with enormous debt and no insurance . Eventually , the coroner found that Greg died from an overdose of fentanyl . How would Greg have had access to this medication ? We know that Greg had taken fentanyl before and had liked the effect . And we also know that he had independent access to the drug . The prosecution suggests that fentanyl is difficult to trace in an autopsy and that Kristin knew that . But why would a toxicologist , if she wanted to do in her husband , choose drugs ? She knew that the coroner would have eventually tested for fentanyl . It would be like drawing a ring around herself . The Tremolet de Villers family claims that Kristin had Greg 's organs donated in short order , presumably so that the autopsy would be rushed . Kristin was sitting in the hospital in shock when a nurse came up to her and said , " I see Greg had an organ donor card . Please sign here because we want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standard procedure . But it was through the autopsy that they discovered that Greg had hepatitis B , which is another big mystery . You mainly get hepatitis B from infected needles or through sexual contact . Greg could n't have gotten it from Kristin because she was inoculated against it for her job at the medical examiner 's office . We do n't know what to make of it , but it does explain why Greg had become so sickly and tired . After the murder investigation began , Kristin was fired from the medical examiner 's office . What happened then ? She quickly got another job at TriLink Biotechnologies , a cutting  --  edge company that makes synthetic DNA for research . She was doing very well there , and they were considering her for management . Her boss is convinced of her innocence and , with our family friends , has set up a fund for her defense . He is holding her job for her ; in the meantime , she is editing ( continued on page 174 ) ( continued from page 136 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Greg 's death . She went to grief counseling almost immediately . She got a dog for comfort and safety . And she moved from their apartment as soon as she could . Do you ever wish Kristin had n't been so honest with the police ? Yes , there are a lot of things I wish she had n't done . I wish she had n't had the affair . That she 'd left Greg earlier . I wish I 'd talked to Greg , or talked to his mother , or that I 'd just grabbed her out of there . What has the toll been on you and your husband personally ? We 're in the fight of our lives . It 's hard to remember to take care of ourselves , physically and emotionally . We have to remember to eat , to sleep , to exercise . Ralph and I both saw doctors for stress-related illness . My cholesterol and blood pressure went sky-high , and I became anemic . Mentally it is very hard . You think about it all the time , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up , do your work , take care of your other children , and be there for Kristin . But we have been blessed by the support of family and friends and the kindness of strangers . What is your state of mind going into the trial ? It 's frightening because it 's so wrong .
