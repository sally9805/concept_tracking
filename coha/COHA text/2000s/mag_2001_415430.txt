Ways to Raise a Can-Do Kid Q. How can we encourage our 3-year-old to be more independent ? He wo n't feed or dress himself or even wash his hands without help ! A. While some toddlers may be a little too eager to do everything without assistance before they 're able , others are more inclined to hang back and let a parent handle it all . To encourage your child to do more things for himself : BE A FACILITATOR When he says , " You do it , " consider why he may be reluctant to take on something on his own . For instance , he may find it too difficult to wash his hands in the sink because it 's too high for him . In that case , a footstool could be just the motivation he needs . DO N'T CRITICIZE If he puts on his T-shirt backward , praise him for trying and suggest that it might work better the other way around . Do n't push too hard or set unrealistic goals , and be sure to point out mistakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he 's learning a new skill . This will build his confidence and make him more eager to try things without assistance from you . PLAY GAMES Challenge him to copy you while you put on your socks and shoes , or have a contest to see who can get dressed first ( let him win ! ) . HAVE HIM PITCH IN Many kids this age love to help Mommy and Daddy with chores around the house . Give your child some simple tasks he can do , such as sorting laundry or putting away silverware . Doing jobs on his own will help foster a sense of accomplishment , which will in turn lead to independence . IF ALL ELSE FAILS , BRIBE Never underestimate the power of a little persuasion . Say , " When you finish dressing yourself , then we 'll go outside and play . " This sort of gentle push may be just the motivation he needs to try things on his own . Germy Kiss My mother kissed my kids while she had a cold sore on her lips . Could she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A kiss can be one way to pass on the herpes simplex virus , which causes cold sores . Other methods of transmission include direct contact with saliva ( such as through the sharing of eating utensils ) or other secretions from the nose , mouth , and eyes . Look for such signs of infection as sores on the gums , lips , or inside the mouth , fever , irritability , sore throat , swollen glands , drooling , and loss of appetite . In some cases , there may be no symptoms at all : The virus may lie dormant for months or even years until activated by physical stress , such as a cold or a fever ( that 's why these flare-ups are called " cold sores " or " fever blisters " ) , or a skin irritation , such as sunburned or chapped lips . If you suspect that your children have caught the virus , call your pediatrician . If they 've developed sores , give them soft , nonacidic foods , such as Jell-O or yogurt , and apply ice-or Popsicles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The doctor may also recommend acetaminophen or topical anesthetics , such as those used for teething . For severe cases , an antiviral medication , in either an ointment or an oral form , may be prescribed . Photograph // The infection should clear up in about a week or so . In the meantime , cut your kids ' fingernails as short as you can to discourage them from picking at the sores , and have them wash their hands regularly to prevent the spread of the virus to other family members and friends . Also ( this is a tough one ! ) , try not to kiss them near their mouths-or let them kiss you-until the sores have healed completely . Pumping Up Iron Q. Our 9-month-old has anemia . What causes it , and what 's the best way to treat it ? A. An insufficient amount of iron in the diet is the most common culprit behind anemia , a condition in which the blood is n't able to carry enough oxygen to the cells for the body to function properly and grow . Babies get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the womb and their bodies store up any extra , but if they do n't get enough of the nutrient after birth , they can use up these reserves by 6 to 9 months of age . ( That 's why doctors routinely check a baby 's blood between 9 and 15 months , or earlier if there are signs of anemia , such as lethargy and paleness , especially of the earlobes and lips . ) Ways to make sure that your little one gets enough iron : Breastfeed for as long as possible . A baby 's intestines can absorb 50 to 75 percent of the nutrient in breast milk , compared with less than 10 percent in infant formula or cereal . ( If bottle-feeding , choose an ironfortified formula . ) Hold off on cow 's milk until your baby 's at least 1 year old . It 's low in iron and can irritate an infant 's immature intestinal lining and cause it to bleed slightly , leading to gradual iron loss . Choose iron-packed foods , such as iron-fortified infant cereals , pureed meats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anemia is serious , your pediatrician may choose to prescribe iron-supplement drops . ( Be sure to keep them out of reach , since too much iron can be poisonous for children . ) Whether the condition is treated with dietary changes or a supplement , it should disappear in about a month .
