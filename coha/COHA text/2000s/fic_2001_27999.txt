Dear Cupid , Do you believe in love at first sight ? Seriously Smitten Dear Seriously Smitten , Absolutely ! But then I always enjoy a good fairy tale . In the real world , things take a bit longer . What appears to be love at first sight is actually a subconscious recognition of a potentially compatible mate , a premonition , so to speak , of what could be . Only time will tell if the premonition comes true . Cupid Kate needed a man . Any man . Well , maybe not any man , she amended as she glanced about the gate area of the Los Angeles airport . The businessman pacing before the window looked too edgy ; the grandfather with the armload of Disney souvenirs too old ; and the two men in the corner appeared a little too interested in each other for her purpose . What she needed was a nice , reasonably attractive sort of man . Someone friendly . Approachable . Someone with whom she could flirt . That was all . Just flirt . The last thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a serious relationship . Romance , on the other hand , was an entirely different matter . Her job required a certain amount of romance in her life , or so she 'd been informed that very morning by Gwen , the owner of Gwendolyn 's Garden , the on-line magazine that ran her advicecolumn . She still could n't believe Gwen had threatened to cancel her . She was Cupid , for goodness ' sake ! They could n't cancel Cupid . Her column generated thousands of hits a month for the e-zinc . Or at least it used to . As Gwen had pointed out , her popularity was dwindlingbecause her column simplify was n't fun anymore . Now , however , was not the time for anger or self-pity . She needed to take control , to recapture the carefree spirit she 'd somehow lost in recent years . Turning her head , she saw a new passenger stroll into the gate area . Her skin prickled with interest at the sight of him , an odd occurrence since he was n't her usual type . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits who wore power as easily as other men wore denim . That description , however , matched her ex-husband a little too close for comfort . Which made this man perfect . He had the sun-streaked hair and rich tan of someone who spent a lot of time relaxing in sunny places . The Hawaiian shirt and khaki pants gave him a casual , lived in look that surprisingly appealed to her . As for his luggage , he carried a duffel bag : an old-fashioned , army-green duffel bag . When he reached the ticket counter , he lifted his blue-mirrored sunglasses and smiled at the ticket agent . Kate 's heart did something it had n't done in years ; it gave one hard thump against her ribs . The man had a devastating smile with perfect white teeth . Generous laugh lines winged outward from his eyes , marking him as older than she 'd first thought . Late thirties , perhaps . As for his body , she could n't quite tell if muscle or flab moved beneath the baggy clothes , but the shape had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrow hips . Just looking at him made some long dormant part of her stir to life . Her smile spread as he took a seat off to himself . She 'd found her man . Now , all she had to do was catch his eye and prove she could still do what she once had done as naturally as breathing . Flirt his pants offfiguratively speaking . Mike pulled off his sunglasses and stowed them in his duffel bag as he collapsed on a hard plastic chair . Dropping the bag at his feet , he took a moment to make sure his computer disks rested safely on top . Then he sank down in the seat to wait for his flight . Exhaustion pulled his head back and closed his eyes . He was getting too old to put in these sixteen-hour workdays for weeks on end . What he would n't give to just pass out for the duration of the flight . Unfortunately , he had too much on his mind to give in to sleeplike the big gaping hole in his life where a wife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair , he let his mind drift back to the twenty-year high school reunion he 'd attended while in L.A. What a reality check that had been ! He still could n't believe his former classmates had children in college , while he had yet to even get married . One of these days , he really needed to look into doing something about his lack of a personal life . The problem was , he enjoyed his job a little too much . Make that way too much . As a special effects movie animator , he loved everything about his work ... well , except the demanding schedule that left him little time for things like dating . As his mind searched for possible solutions to the problem , a jangling thud sounded right before him . He tuned it out easily . Working on movie sets for the past twenty-odd years had taught him to tune out all manner of chaos . The bump on his leg , however , was n't so easy to ignore . " I 'm so sorry , " an anxious voice insisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes and found a woman crouched before him as she reached beneath his seat . " How terribly clumsy of me , " she said . With her head bent , her shoulder-length , coppery curls brushed his knee . Bending sideways , he saw her purse had fallen and spilled its contents at his feet . He leaned forward , intending to help her on her way as expediently as possible . " I swear , I 'm such a klutz today , " she rushed on , gathering up pens and breath mints , a paperback novel , a pair of reading glasses , some loose change , a set of keys , and several business cards . Shaking his head , he reached for a runaway tube of lipstick only to have his hand collide with hers . The lipstick tried to skitter away , but he grabbed it before it made good its escape . " Gotcha , " he said , chuckling . He lifted his head to address the lipstick 's owner and found himself face-to-face with the most enchanting woman he 'd ever seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impish nose , stubborn chin , and pouty lips that begged to be tasted . Gazing into her shamrock-green eyes , he felt his insides swirl , as if he were failing forward into a field of clovera field where a man could lie back and rest with a woman snuggled to his side as he lazily watched the clouds float by . A smile slowly turned up the corners of her lips , and he realized her eyes tipped up at the corners as well . " I really am terribly sorry , " she said in a breathy voice that reached inside him and tied his stomach into knots of pure desire . " It 's the flying , you see . " She placed a hand over her chest . " Planes makes me very ... nervous . " His gaze dropped to her hand , which rested right at the point of her V-collared red suit . He would never have guessed a woman with orange hair could look that good in red , but on her the combination staggered the senses . Or , perhaps his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From what he could see , she had great breasts . Perfect breasts . The kind of breasts that could incite a man 's lust , pillow his head . Or nurture his child . His gaze snapped back to hers . She gave him a patient little smileas if waiting for him to say something in return . Only , he could n't remember her last comment , much less form a suitable response . She laughed lightly . " Not that I 'm stingy or anything , but I really do n't think it 's your shade . " " My shade ? " he repeated , wondering what shade her breasts could possibly be that would n't suit him just fine . " No , actually that 's my shade , " she said . " As in my shade of lipstick ? " She rose slowly to stand before him . The red suit hugged the kind of figure that had been in style back in the forties : full breasts , nipped-in waist , generous hips . Staring at that body , he wondered why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anorexic clothes hangers . This was what men wanted : Woman in her most powerful , elemental form . When he continued to stare at her , she pointed to his hand . " You 're holding my lipstick . " He glanced down . " So I am . " She started to reach for it . " How gallant of you to rescue it for me . " " Not so fast . " He snatched the tube out of her reach . " How do I know it 's yours ? " She raised a brow at such an obvious ploy , but her eyes sparkled with mischief . " Now , that is a dilemma . " " Let 's see ... " He drew the words out , enjoying the game , anything to keep her near . " I suppose I could have you describe it for me . " " All right . " She tossed her head and his fingers twitched with the temptation to bury themselves deep within her fiery curls . Would her hair feel as hot as it looked ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to half-mast . " It 's round , " she said huskily . " And it 's hard . And it 's the color of passionate peaches . " All the blood rushed from his head right to his groin . God , what he would n't give to pounce on her right there in the airport . Numbly , he opened his palm and read the label on the end of the tube . Passionate Peach . " So it is , " he muttered . Her fingertips brushed his palm as she took the lipstick from him . Was that her hand trembling , or his ? " I do n't know how I 'll ever thank you , " she said . His mind conjured up a few dozen possibilities . With a final , knowing smile , she turned and walked away , her hips swaying to a seductive beat . He stared after her , determined to give her a salute of approval the moment she glanced back over her shoulder . But she never looked back . Even as she took her seat between two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He frowned , thinking it odd that such an accomplished ' flirt would leave it at that . Then he remembered the flutter of her hand , the heightened color of her skin . Either she 'd been equally affected by their game , or she was n't as bold as she pretended to be . Before he could decide , the ticket agent gave first-class passengers permission to board . He started to reach for his duffel bag , but stopped when a white rectangle on the floor caught his eye . One of the business cards that had spilled from her purse still lay at his feet . He picked up the card , hoping to learn her name , but the mug shot printed on the front proved a disappointment . The attractive blond woman who smiled back at him was not the woman he 'd just met . Although returning the card would give him the perfect excuse to speak to her again . Better yet , the phone number was for the Lake Travis area , just west of Austin , where he now lived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or knew someone who did . His mind searched for the best way to return the card as he swung the duffel bag over his shoulder and headed for the ramp . Kate pressed a palm to her stomach to still the jitters . She could n't believe she 'd dumped her purse on the man 's feet like that . Not that she 'd had much choice since merely dropping the purse had n't fazed him . Oh , but once she 'd gained his attention ... Heavens , he had gorgeous eyes , and a slow sexy smile that made her insides flutter just thinking about it . She averted her gaze to give her nerves time to settle , but from the corner of her eye , she saw the man disappear down the ramp . What was he doing boarding with first class ? One of the main reasons she 'd picked him was because he seemed so unassuming . She certainly had n't pegged him as a man with money . Not that she had anything against money . She adored all the wonderful things it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put themselves and their work before family , which put them on her bad listalong with a lot of other men . She frowned at that last thought , realizing that maybe Gwen was right . Maybe she had become too cynical to serve as the Dear Abby for the lovelorn on the Internet . Memories from the meeting that morning rushed back over her . Oh , God . She slumped forward and buried her face in her hands . How could she possibly save her job as the expert on romance when she 'd completely lost her faith in love ? And what would she do if she could n't save it ? She had no other job experience . All she had were a stack of bills to pay and a seven-year-old son to feed . " Are you quite all right , dear ? " the elderly woman seated beside her asked . " Hmm ? " She lifted her head . " Yes , I 'm fine . Thank you . " " Are you sure ? " the woman persisted in motherly concern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her color go a shade brighter . " Really , I 'm fine . " More than fine , actually . Her body positively tingled with aftershocks of attraction for the man in the Hawaiian shirt . Well , if nothing else , at least she 'd remembered how it felt to flirt . And that 's all the exchange had been . A passing flirtation . No need for embarrassmenteven if she had let the exchange become , entirely too blatant . She cringed upon remembering the phallic way she 'd described her lipstick . She was a mother , for goodness ' sake . She had no business flirting with a stranger in an airport . She shuddered to think of the impression she must have given him . Her only comfort came from knowing she 'd never have to see him again . At least not after she landed in Austin . In the meantime , she had to get on the planeand with him seated in first class , that meant she 'd have to walk right by him . She moaned again , and buried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his hand as he waited for the woman in red to board . On the back , he 'd discovered a handwritten note . Kate , Good luck in L.A. See you when you get back . Linda . The name on the front of the card was Linda Davis , so Kate had to be the woman carrying the card . Kate . A smile tugged at his lips . The name suited her . Kate with the saucy red hair and sweet green eyes . Just then she appeared through the hatch and his stomach clenched . Never in his life had he felt such an instant kick of attraction to a woman . No , it was more than attraction . It was ... a connection . He quickly slipped the card into the breast pocket of his shirt , deciding to wait until the plane was in flight to return it . That way he could go back into the coach area and talk to her rather than simply hand it to her as she passed . Still , he wanted to catch her attention so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her smile . Only , she kept her gaze fixed firmly ahead as she walked by him . Frowning , he turned in his seat and watched her move down the aisle , all the while willing her to look back . Instead , she took a seat halfway back , never once glancing his way , The longer he watched her , the more confused he became by her inconsistencies . Her stylish suit said Professional Businesswoman , but her tousled curls defied convention . As if sensing his gaze , she shifted nervously , not at all the confident woman who had flirted with him in the gate area . Could his instincts have been wrong about her ? Maybe fate had n't dropped a potential wife in his lap , Just as his doubts began to rise , she turned to the young mother who sat across from her and her whole face softened with a smile at the sight of the child in the woman 's arms . There it was , the jolt from her smile that told him she was the answer to why he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He 'd simply been waiting for her .
