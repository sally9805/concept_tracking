The town had moved the Confederate Monument from the square to the gates of Springforth Cemetery some twenty years after the War of Northern Aggression , and General Robert E. Lee  --  who stood atop the mossy marble with a scowl  --  had never quite recovered . The general was listing , slowly sinking in the boggy soil , his finger pointing no longer at the ghostly Union brigade ahead , but just down and to the left , toward the new Ideal Laundry Factory , as if to demand extra starch . The stony glare of the good general was the last thing Emma Hanley 's grandfather saw as he sat at his mahogany desk in his office , pondering a lost factory  --  foreclosure by some outfit up North was imminent  --  and an astonishing sweep of bad investments . As he swallowed the muzzle of a Colt .45 , William McCann peered at the general , who seemed to look back at him approvingly , a kinship that comes from being beaten down by Yankees . <p> William McCann 's self- inflicted gunshot on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But then , he never did have a head for business . In those days , a man was born with his fortune , and occasionally he increased it , but he never lost it . And McCann , who 'd never quite cottoned to the textile industry , had managed to lose everything , as his widow , Josephine , quickly discovered . The tree- lined estate in town went first , the family 's seasonal residences next  --  the seaside place in Charleston , the summer bungalow in the Blue Ridge Mountains  --  everything inside them auctioned off , crated , and shipped down to the pickle forks and finger bowls , how could they ? <p> They could ; they did . The wealthy in Palmetto had little sympathy for downfall brought about by a gentleman 's folly . Travel lust , for example . Seduced by the lure of far- flung jungles , perilous crags , and shimmering deserts , McCann had , for some time , been obsessed by exotic botanicals . He fancied himself a plant hunter  --  ignoring his failing business and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , appeasing her with promises of civilized travel fit for a woman upon his return . <p> A pity , many in the town noted , that shortly before her husband 's unfortunate firearm accident  --  for that is what the family thereafter referred to it as , an accident , a man simply cleaning his gun  --  Josephine McCann had already sent a steamer trunk to Paris , in preparation for a season with her daughter , Angeline , on the Continent . That voyage was canceled , the trunk recalled . Without means , the McCann women found themselves stuck in Palmetto , South Carolina . <p> The financial snarl untangled , the fortune unspooled , and the McCann women 's property shrank to a dot on the map , to a single address : Amaranth  --  a staid Victorian at the edge of town , built on a whim a decade previously , on land McCann had purchased purely for its rich , well- drained soil , fierce fecundity , and eastern light . <p> At Amaranth , the widow Josephine insisted decorum remain . Linen napkins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meals , as well as a few remaining pieces of silverware , the handles heavy as guns . In time , daughter Angeline  --  who had not been a debutante , having lost that privilege along with other trappings  --  settled for a young soldier as a husband , a doughboy . The poor soul lost his mind on the battlefields of France and never found it again . Angeline moved from her brief newlywed venture back into Amaranth with her mother . Six months later , Emma arrived , born into a house hold of women pining for escape , who continued to insist they were trapped in a decidedly lower station in life , a station from which there was no leaving the town , at least not in any sort of civilized fashion . <p> But that was going to change , finally . For on this unseasonably warm April morning nearly eight de cades after her grandfather 's firearm mishap , Emma Hanley , seventy- two , found herself just days away from embarking on a journey of a lifetime . The Trip , as her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes  --  a cruise to Europe . <p> That was the year spring rushed through the town , barely stopping . By April , a morning stroll produced clammy sweat at the nape of one 's neck  --  a sure sign of an approaching brutal summer . But this harbinger of a merciless season did not overly concern the people of Palmetto , as it would have years before , back when a cruel season made airless lint- filled mills suffocating , left crops dead , farmers unpaid , and children unfed . Now , there was central air , office jobs , and grocery stores . Cable television brought news all day and all night  --  reports that the Berlin Wall might soon fall , rumors the Japanese were buying up Hawaii , hotel by hotel . There was a rosy- cheeked president well into his seventh decade for whom Emma Hanley did not much care , though she did find some use for him : When Harold protested that Emma and he were too old to take the Trip , she reminded her husband that the Leader of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twice voted  --  was even older . <p> That was the spring when Emma 's life took a dramatically new course , and it all started that Saturday morning in April 1987 , a day when Emma was happier than she 'd been in years  --  studying her itinerary , wondering about comfortable shoes and all- weather cloaks , peering at her husband across the stack of maps and Fodor 's Guides on the dining room table , nodding pleasantly as he announced he would soon be heading to the Biscuit Basket for his daily coffee klatch . For in the last few weeks , travel plans had brought to the Hanley marriage an unexpected spirit of compromise . Nowadays , when Harold sucked his teeth or stayed too long at his breakfasts , all Emma had to do was think of the Trip , and a thrill like harp strings would thrum inside her , and she would be happy again . <p> " Look here at this mess , " Harold said now , holding up the morning newspaper . " No respect for the dead . " Emma @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign currency . CEMETERY VANDALS STRIKE AGAIN ! the headline on the front page of the metto Newseamed , and there was a picture of the general himself  --  festooned with toilet paper and what appeared to be Hawaiian leis , looking , appropriately enough , drunk and rakish . Behind the statue , streamers drooped over the rusty iron spires of Springforth . Harold studied the article . When he read silently , his lips moved . " Says here , kids done it , " he said . " Teenagers and their parties . " He shook his head . <p> " Perhaps someone at town hall will remember now to fix the memorial , " Emma said cheerfully . There had been talk about repairing the Confederate Monument for years , and restoring the cemetery , and doing something with the old mill and all the rest , but then the town would forget , and nothing happened . It was as if the people of Palmetto just stopped seeing the statues , the shuttered cotton mills , the vandalized graveyards . They drove right by , sealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nodding their heads to music . Even the McCann saga had apparently been wiped from the town 's memory . Although the old cotton factory  --  with the McCann name fading on the brick  --  remained , and there was still a McCann side street and , for a short time , a shopping center with the name , no one except Emma herself and her friends Miss Gibble and Lila Day associated the McCann name with lost fortune or with penniless women lamenting their strangled fate . Come to think of it , Emma reflected now , perhaps the town 's collective amnesia was n't such a bad thing after all . <p> " Gon na be a hot one today , " Harold said , reading aloud now the detailed weather forecast  --  complete with humidity levels and wind directions  --  in that halting way that set Emma 's teeth on edge . Tripshe thought , the Trip . <p> She smiled . " Good , it will be nice to get away . They say that London is cool this time of year . " <p> Harold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now that they had a little savings and an abundance of time , he had finally agreed to venture overseas because , as Emma reminded him , he owed her this favor . He owed her because de cades of installing appliances meant Harold had spent years in women 's kitchens , which led to having coffee with them , or iced tea and a slice of pound cake , accompanied by long talks and she did n't know what all . She did n't care to speculate . Oh , Harold had cultivated himself quite a following in Palmetto , all right , though Emma had never put her foot down . Well , perhaps a few times , many years before : knock- down drag- outs that ended with seething anger , threats of leaving , a violent clashing , damp sheets , and , nine months later , a child . Three of these battles had names : Will , Dora , and Bobby . <p> " More coffee ? " she asked . <p> " I 'll get some Sanka later . " He put on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Not with all the things I 've got left to do . " It was part of the Hanleys ' new unspoken agreement : He <p> would pretend to demand Emma come along to his morning coffee klatch with all those adoring widow women as vigorously as she would decline . With the Trip on the horizon , Emma was perfectly happy to send him off to the Biscuit Basket , and he knew it . Her interests remained elsewhere : across the Atlantic , where , according to their itinerary , they would be within a week at the dazzling Dutch Capital of Amsterdam with its quaint , cobbled streets , steeply gabled merchants ' houses , and famous museums and galleries . Yes , thought Emma , after thirty- seven years of marriage , she and Harold were enjoying some well- earned equilibrium , at least temporarily . A regular cease- fire . For what was marriage but a treaty between two warring little nations , a congress of conflicting desires and wills ? <p> " There is one little thing , before you go , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood at the door in the black jogging pants he 'd taken to wearing these days . His tan Windbreaker was zipped , the baseball cap pulled down , hiding his eyes . He was waiting to be dismissed . It was twenty after eight . In ten minutes , he 'd be out the door . You could set your watch by him . Emma 's husband was a man who 'd established times for everything  --  bedtimes , meals , and bowel movements . Daylight saving time presented a quandary every six months in the Hanley house hold , until Harold , with a shot of prune juice and a stack of Reader 's Digests , reset himself . Try to drag a man like that across the ocean and to a different time zone . <p> " Could you help get my old trunk down from the attic ? " she asked . <p> Ah , the travel trunk . One of the few possessions Emma had brought to her marriage . <p> When she 'd met Harold , Emma had still been living at Amaranth . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leonard Anderson , a jowly and coarse woman whose meaty arms waggled as she beat eggs ; she was glad to have a fine lady like Emma as a tenant , quiet and minding her own business among the cacophony of boisterous , drunken fools who swarmed the place . <p> While there were respectable rooming houses in the town for maiden ladies in 1950 , Amaranth was n't one of them . But how could Emma leave ? That place was a kind of purgatory , a parallel world that both tortured and flattered her with memories of better times . The chandelier in the foyer , stripped of its crystals , blinked dimly and swung in crooked , precarious arcs . The strips of torn cabbage rose wallpaper in the hallway waved vaguely in the drafts of cold air . The red carpet , trod upon by steel- toed work boots , offered a pink threadbare path up the stairs . <p> Emma had been teaching the lower grades for nearly a decade by then . Her grandmother was long gone , her mother , with whom she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been dead all of six weeks , and Emma found some comfort in going through her grandmother 's travel trunk daily , sorting her grandfather 's botanical sketches . She 'd kept the trunk since she was a young thing , cherishing it like a hope chest . Instead of putting away linens and finery for an impending marriage  --  prospects were too dim for that  --  Emma had stuffed the steamer with magazines , a crumpled atlas or two , and a bundle of vintage postcards from Rome , Paris , and London that she 'd happened upon once at a flea market . And there was also the small , sad worn wad of money that her grandmother had stashed there for an emergency , an occasion that , Emma reflected , not only had arrived , but also , for a very long time , never stopped . <p> In those weeks after her mother died , Emma checked the train schedules every Tuesday , taking along her emergency fund , zipped in the side pocket of her satin- lined pocketbook . A one- way ticket could take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached the station ticket window , close enough to see the bearded , weary man there talking on the black phone while eating his lunch , close enough to see the nervous , timid red- headed woman reflected back in the glass . <p> And then came the morning Emma heard an awful clatter from downstairs , and Mrs. Anderson 's hearty laughter , too . Emma closed the trunk , locked her door , and ventured downstairs to the kitchen to find out what all the racket was about , the clanging and shouts . There was a new stove being put in . The other one just upped and quit on me , Mrs. Anderson told her , no telling how old . The previous stove , white enamel , heavy as God , sat upended in the corner , its doors and pipes amputated and discarded in a pile , and it hurt Emma to look at it , to remember the legions of Christmas turkeys and Easter hams her grandmother had once cooked in it . Then , from behind the new stove , Harold Hanley stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheen of sweat glistening on his forehead , HAL stitched over one pocket of his tight dun- colored work shirt . His gaze fell on Emma , and he nodded politely , but he left those yellow eyes on her face , the heat of him shone on her and she was so alone , like freezing to death , numb and half- dead for so long  --  she had n't realized how lonely ! And scared ? Lord , she was scared , her mother not cold in her grave , and Emma herself hibernating . There were combed grooves in his black hair . Hair oil ! Only the lower- class men wore hair oil , only the workers . The room spun and left her weak-kneed , till Mrs. Anderson hobbled over with a dinette chair and said , You sit down here . Girl , you look right peaked . <p> And so it was that Emma found herself courted , quite suddenly engaged , and scolded by Miss Gibble , her supervising teacher , who taught the upper grades . Upon news of Emma 's unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You 'll be bored to tears , with your mind , " Miss Gibble warned . " What on earth will you talk about with that man ? " <p> Talk ? Talk did n't have much to do with it . Instead , Emma 's impending marriage had to do with the certain spot on the nape of her neck that Harold Hanley had discovered . Yes , there were those who said she was marrying beneath her , settling for an unschooled appliance repairman who did not even have his high school diploma . But there were those who thought the reverse , too , that Harold Hanley was marrying an old maid teacher when he could have had a levelheaded girl better at doing things like pickling peaches or ironing sheets and scrubbing the kitchen floor with Old Dutch . <p> " You 're not settling down . You 're just settling , " Miss Gibble chided , before she turned to clap the erasers over a trash can . " Now you 'll never leave this town . " <p> And what does ol ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked later , after Emma had shared her best friend 's misgivings with him . Back when Emma still shared such thoughts with Harold . What does that one know about loving ? <p> Miss Gibble did indeed know about loving , since she 'd lost her fiancT , a pilot from Mississippi , when he was shot down over Germany in the war . He 'd been a blond , handsome man with enormous red protruding ears , whose smiling photograph and lock of hair stayed in a heavy gold locket tucked behind the starched white muslin of Miss Gibble 's blouse . Occasionally , Miss Gibble would open the locket and gaze down at the diminutive grinning face there before slowly closing the cover again , as if it were the lid of a tiny coffin . I shall always be a miss , insisted Miss Gibble to the teaching faculty after the funeral . None of this silly talk about how there will be others . For there will be no one else . <p> Shortly after her marriage , Emma used the emergency fund from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officially launching Hanley 's Appliance Repair . She and Harold moved into their ' 50s split- level that was all the rage then , a spec house that went cheap when the builder went broke . By then , Emma was expecting , and could n't lift anything heavier than a teacup . They 'd hardly had any furniture anyway . As for the travel trunk , it was relegated to the attic , until this day , when Emma persuaded Harold to finally lug it down . <p> The trunk , battered and filthy , sat now in the sunny corner of their kitchen like a mysterious stranger soaking up warmth and company . <p> Harold looked warily at it from the corner of his eye while he drank a glass of water at the sink , as if he still did n't believe her claims that , no , she did n't plan to take that old thing on the Trip . What Emma had in mind was finding her grandmother 's travel journal . She was certain it was in there somewhere , and would n't that be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But she kept that wish to herself . There was no use appealing to Harold 's nostalgic side , for Emma suspected her husband did not have one . The past did not much concern a man who was content to live in the present , whose retirement days offered him so much fun . <p> " Maybe I should make Bobby get out a little this morning , " Harold said now from behind her . " On the Trip , he 's going to have to get used to doing things he do n't like . " <p> " Well , you can try , I suppose , " she said , playing along . By pretending to insist their son accompany him , Harold was clearly assuaging his own guilt about escaping to the Biscuit Basket . <p> " Bobby ? " he called . " You sure you do n't feel like a walk ? " <p> There was no reply from the living room , just the antic whirs and boing boing sounds of morning cartoons and the smoke from Bobby 's unfiltered Camels . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the groggy response . <p> Harold met her eyes , then shook his head , sadder than usual . " Well , I tried . " <p> " Do n't worry , " Emma said now . " He 's going to have to get out with us this afternoon . " After a beat , she said , " Shoe shopping , Harold . Do n't tell me you forgot ? " <p> Puzzlement did a funny little dance across his features , until resignation took hold . " No . No , I did n't forget . Guess I 'll pick up the medicine at the drugstore on the way back this morning . Reckon you better call and check to make sure they got it ready ? " <p> " All right . " <p> " The extra , too , " he said . <p> The medicine for the trip is what he meant . Bobby 's pills . The extra dose to help Bobby calm down and sleep . Was it a rebuke , Harold 's reminder about Bobby 's need for extra medicine ? Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy . But they could n't very well leave him behind with Dora . <p> Dora would insist on taking Bobby to that new church over at the Crossroads shopping center . All that talk of demons fleeing , saints suffering , and Jesus appearing just ignited Bobby 's own delusions . For days after his last visit , when Emma asked Bobby to do something as simple as taking out the garbage , she found herself competing with the voices of John the Baptist and Saint Paul . And the saints always won out . <p> " Yes , I 'll call the pharmacy . " Emma said . " I 'll see to it they have the extras ready . You 're walking ? " <p> Silly question . Harold always walked to his breakfasts . Somehow , even in sweatpants and Windbreaker and cap , he was fine-looking . Yes , she 'd have to give him that . He was slim , without the paunch most men his age acquired . And he had his own teeth and drove at night . Quite a commodity . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't resist asking . " And the McCormick sisters ? " <p> " Yeah , I reckon Betty and them will be there . " <p> " I believe she mentioned that last night . When I ran into her at Winn- Dixie . Funny  --  Betty did n't know about the Trip . I promised we 'd send her a postcard . " <p> Harold adjusted his cap in the hall mirror . <p> The evening before , when Emma had encountered Betty Snodgrass hovering over the cucumbers in the produce aisle , Betty had practically purred , Oh , your husband , that Hal Hanley , he just tickles me no end ! And Betty , whose arthritic hip gave her a gimpy sway like a drunken dancer , and whose thin lips shone like cellophane  --  lip gloss at her age !  --  whispered , in her smoker 's rasp , He keeps us in stitches . Just a darling . Emma chuckled in a way she hoped resembled fondness before reminding Betty in an offhand way that she was just frantic planning their golden honeymoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made that part up , of course . Harold would never call their impending trip a golden honeymoon , but a little lie like that was worth it just to see Betty 's crestfallen expression . <p> The truth was , Emma now lacked the patience to converse with Betty or Velma Scranton or the McCormick twins about double- coupon days and the senior citizen booth at the flea market . The McCormick sisters still dressed as if they were young things , rouged and clad in polka dots and heels , sopping up sausage biscuits and milk gravy , their dentures clacking . Velma claimed she was retired from the textile industry , though Emma knew she 'd spent thirty years sewing the crotch seam in dungarees . Not one of them was interested in the Eiffel Tower or Stonehenge or the Royal Tulip Garden ; they had made that perfectly clear . Hal 's Gals , people called them . <p> " I guess I better get a move on , " Harold said now . The stove clock read eight thirty . <p> " You go on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Biscuit Basket and your fans , she stopped herself from adding . " I 'm sure they 'll be waiting . " <p> He stepped out on the front porch and turned to close the door behind him , not bothering to hide the delight and anticipation on his face as he finally headed out . <p> It never occurred to Emma he might not return . <p> Excerpted from Secret Keepers by Mindy Friddle .
