TIME What will it mean to be the first woman Speaker of the House ? <P> PELOSI It is a sensational feeling . Women walk up to me on the street . Every place I go , they are so thrilled . It is a source of inspiration for a lot of people . What it means is , I have to uphold the highest ethical standards and to have the most open and bipartisan Congress , to do so in a way that makes women proud and makes sure that pretty soon we 'll have another woman Speaker of the House . <P> TIME Can Democrats trust President George W. Bush enough to work with him ? <P> PELOSI I think we have to start from a level of trust . On some issues where there is consensus , we can cooperate and build bridges of trust . <P> TIME Oblivious , in denial , incompetent , dangerous . Do you regret using any of these words to describe the President ? <P> PELOSI No . <P> TIME Should at least 30,000 troops be home from Iraq @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would hope at least that number would be out of harm 's way . They are viewed as an occupation force . Our presence there is a magnet for terrorists . <P> TIME If President Bush had fired Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld two months ago , would you be in the position you are now ? <P> PELOSI Yes . Donald Rumsfeld is an employee . The President of the United States makes the policy , and the more he campaigned , the better we did . <P> TIME If Bush vetoes one or two of the bills you pass in the House , will that be a sign that he 's not prepared to work with you ? <P> PELOSI No , it 's just a sign he disagrees with us . <P> TIME Will Americans see their taxes raised by Democrats ? <P> PELOSI Middle-income families in America will see their taxes reduced . <P> TIME Is it correct that you might have hearings about how Hurricane Katrina was handled , but looking forward ? <P> PELOSI Yes , exactly .

We have to address the issue of natural disasters in a way that does n't say that your survival depends on your economic well-being . <P> TIME Will your performance as Speaker have implications for Hillary Clinton if she runs for President ? <P> PELOSI I 'm not sure you would have asked a man that about another man . But since this is unusual , I will respect your question . I think it 's really important for the people of our country to see that women can wield power and success in this rarefied and high altitude of power . I do n't think Hillary Clinton , though , needs any validation from any other woman . She is an experienced Senator , articulate and a force in her own right .
