A noted Darwin historian probes the naturalist 's inner life . Psychiatrist Ralph Colp Jr . ' s favorite patient has been buried in Westminster Abbey since 1882 . Nevertheless , Colp has come to know him intimately through unpublished letters , his medical diary , and written reminiscences of his family and friends in British and American archives . The patient is Charles Darwin , about whom Colp has written many articles and the classic , 1977 book , To Be an Invalid : The Illness of Charles Darwin , which he is currently revising . After practicing surgery for five years , Colp switched to psychiatry and became a Diplomate of the American Board of Psychiatry and Neurology ( Psychiatry ) in 1965 . He served as attending psychiatrist at Columbia University Health Services until 1993 , and is now a senior associate in the Program of Human Sexuality and Sex Therapy at the New York University Medical Center and a member of the Psychohistory Forum . But it is his labor of love that has earned him a reputation as the dean of Darwin historians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colp , now 81 , about Darwin 's personality , family life , politics , and illness . NATURAL HISTORY : When did you first become interested in Charles Darwin ? RALPH COLP JR. : My father was a surgeon , and in his office were framed portraits of Darwin , Freud , Huxley , Lister , and Pasteur . As a child , I thought they were heroes of science , much nobler than my father and his colleagues who practiced medicine as a business . When I was in high school , in the 1940s , my biology teacher said , " Nobody believes in Darwinism any more , " yet she kept mentioning him . I saw that he was exerting a force , still stirring up controversies sixty years after his death . But my interest from the first , staring at Darwin 's portrait when I was a boy , was , " What was he like as a man ? " I really started taking him on seriously in 1959 , when I was thirty-five , and there were all the scientific celebrations and press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NH : How can one analyze the mental state of a person who died long ago ? COLP : Darwin 's life is extraordinarily well documented by letters , diaries , notebooks , and his own record of his health . His handwriting is often very difficult to decipher , however , and even when you do decipher it , you might find some fragment incomprehensible . It can call for a bit of scholarly sleuthing . For instance , in an 1858 letter to his wife , Emma , Darwin complains that he had been to Farnham in Surrey , and that " the Review and the confounded Queen " made him feel ill . What could that mean ? Perhaps a nasty article about the Queen had appeared in the popular magazine Quarterly Review ? I searched it in vain . But when I checked newspapers for the Queen 's whereabouts on that date , I found that she was near Farnham reviewing some troops . Now it was clear : this man who I knew loved military parades was upset by the sloppy drill described in the article @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dust . So he came alive for me there . Multiply that by hundreds of instances of figuring out the meaning of fragments . NH : How well do you feel you know him ? COLP : Probably much better than I know some of my living friends and patients . I 'm interested in physical details as well as his emotional and inner life . Even the way he walked , or worked , or the quality of his laugh-it was thin , musical , and hollow sounding , like a peal . He and Thomas Huxley liked to sit and joke and laugh for hours . Darwin lived an exemplary life as an English country gentleman , the affectionate father to a brood of seven children . Sometimes he sat on the local magistrate 's bench as ajustice of the Peace , " to help keep order in the neighborhood . " He was always kind and considerate to his servants and gardeners , and taught his children to always address them with " please " and " thank you . " NH : What are your views on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959 , I noticed that the many biographies of him had little to say about the causes and nature of the illness that dominated his life . In To Be an Invalid , I published the first comprehensive account of his illness . I showed that as a youth he suffered brief psychosomatic symptoms from transient mental stresses , and as an adult he suffered protracted psychosomatic illness-altered sensations , cardiac palpitations , headaches , and trembling-mainly from working on his controversial theory of evolution . He had told a friend that to abandon Church teachings on the immutability of species was " like confessing a murder . " He delayed writing the Origin of Species for more than twenty years , until a younger naturalist , Alfred Russel Wallace , forced his hand . His endless agonizing , guilt , and self-flagellation over writing and publishing could be described as obsessive . When his theory was accepted and he stopped working on it , his health improved . Darwin was always a sensitive individual , but after the Beagle voyage he became even more so , and two years afterward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic disease . But Darwin 's own doctors were baffled . Not until 1959 did Saul Adler , an Israeli parasitologist , suggest that Darwin 's illness was Chagas ' disease . During Darwin 's lifetime the disease was not yet known to medicine , so it is no wonder it was never diagnosed . In 1835 Darwin had recorded in his diary that he was bitten by the " Benchuca vinchuca bug . . . called the great black bug of the Pampas , " a vector of the parasitic trypanosome that causes Chagas ' disease see " In the Heat of the Night , " by Graciela Flores , July-August 2005 . Darwin appears to have had the arrested form of the disease , which can appear years after the bite and causes weakness , nausea , and flatulence for many years . NH : How did the illness affect his daily life ? COLP : He could only work for two or three hours a day , and therefore followed a regimen of alternating work and rest . Yet his dogged determination carried him through thousands of experiments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His wife , Emma , would regulate any visitors and strictly limit the time they were with him ; he rarely left home and described himself as a " semi-invalid . " But he often used his illness as a convenient excuse to avoid unwanted visitors and dinner parties . NH : Can we discuss the death of his daughter Annie , on which you 've written the article " Charles Darwin 's " insufferable grief " Free Associations 9:7-44 ( 1987 ) ? COLP : He had an enormous capacity for love , but was inhibited in expressing it . His sisters , who raised him , never talked about his mother , who died when he was eight years old . He learned to hold back his emotions , but when Annie died at the age often in April 1851 from " fever " ( which some now believe was tuberculosis ) , he was inconsolable . It was the first time anyone had seen him cry . His sister-in-law was present and wept with him . Darwin expressed his feelings in a moving tribute to Annie , containing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection . Here are some passages : Her dear face now rises before me , as she used sometimes to come running down stairs with a stolen pinch of snuff for me , her whole form radiant with the pleasure of giving pleasure . . . . She would at almost anytime spend half-an-hour in arranging my hair , " making it , " as she called it , " beautiful , " or in smoothing , the poor dear darling , my collar or cuffs , in short in fondling me . She liked being kissed ; indeed every expression in her countenance beamed with affection &; kindness , &; all her habits were influenced by her loving disposition . . . . All her movements were vigorous , active , &; unusually graceful : when going round the sand-walk with me , although I walked fast , yet she often used to go before pirouetting in the most elegant way , her dear face bright all the time , with the sweetest smiles . ... In the last days of her illness , when so exhausted that she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , &; said some tea " was beautifully good . " When I gave her some water , she said " I quite thank you " ; &; these , I believe were the last precious words ever addressed by her dear lips to me . . . . We have lost the joy of the Household , and the solace of our old age . Annie 's death seemed to him so unjust that it precipitated his loss of belief in God . NH : Did he have strong feelings on social issues ? COLP : Yes , he grew up in an anti-slavery household . The Wedgwood-Darwin family had a long tradition of Abolitionist support . A famous Wedgwood ceramic plaque shows a slave in chains with the slogan , " Am I not a man and a brother ? " In Brazil he witnessed slavery firsthand , and never forgot the screams of a tortured slave coming from a house in Pernambuco . Watching or hearing people in pain made him physically ill . That was why he could not become a surgeon himself , as his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edinburgh when he could not bear the screams of a strapped-down child in surgery-and never returned to pursue his medical career . He was against slavery not only on political and humane grounds , but also because it made him literally sick to his stomach . NH : And yet he abandoned the cause during the American Civil War ? COLP : In 1861 Union troops boarded the English mail steamer RMS Trent and seized two Confederate officials who were bound for London to seek support for the Rebels . The English declared that to be an act of war unless the pair was freed . Darwin began to fear that the provocation by the North might lead to war between England and America . So he stopped supporting the Union cause , and opined that the North should learn to co-exist peacefully with the slave-owning South . Here was the strongest political principle that he had , and he compromised it out of petty patriotism . What the hell was wrong with him ? He knew better than that . NH : Has your intimate knowledge of Darwin influenced your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I realized that there were certain similarities . Like Darwin , I grew up in the shadow of a prominent physician for a father , and was expected to follow in his footsteps to become a surgeon . Like Darwin , I rebelled against following the path that had been set out for me . Although I did practice surgery for several years , I was more interested in the mind and the emotions and became a psychiatrist . I have grown to imitate Darwin in many ways . My daily habits of early rising and then doing important writing first thing , for instance , and how I organize my day around strictly timed alternating periods of work and relaxation , of annotating and abstracting the books that I read , and of writing my first drafts on the backs of used sheets of paper-all of these habits I picked up from Darwin . He kept a diary on the early emotional expressions of his children , and I did the same when my daughters were infants . I try to be caring and helpful to my friends , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young son fell ill , Darwin drew on his own agonizing deathwatch of Annie to comfort him : " Much love much trial , but what an utter desert is life without love .
