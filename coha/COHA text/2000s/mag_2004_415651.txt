Bomber shelter or light load ? With these convertible tents , you make the call . By Michael Lanza // DO YOU OWN A HOUSE IN ASPEN , a cottage on the Cape , and a loft in Manhattan ? Then go ahead , buy a tent for every type of trip ; these days you can find specialized shelters for deserts , mountains , thru-hiking , even the tropics . But if you do n't have cash to burn , check out these five versatile tents . Each adapts to a range of climates by pitching in three different configurations-entire tent , rainfly only , canopy only . In punishing weather from Maine to Mt . Rainier , we loved the solid protection they afforded in batten-down mode . On storm-free trips , we appreciated shaving pounds by leaving the canopy or rainfly at home . The reviews follow in order of overall performance . MARMOT EQUINOX OVERALL : 4.1 Rock-solid stability and cavernous vestibules made this our favorite for stormy living . $259 ; 36 sq . ft. ; 6 lbs . 9 oz. ( fly-only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12 oz . HIGHS Strength Put off the alpine start . The sturdy , three-pole frame and taut , no-flapping pitch let us sleep late , even through whipping rain and wind on the Maine coast . The flyonly pitch is one of the test 's strongest as well , making this our top pick for unruly weather . Vestibules The Equinox has the test 's biggest vestibules-10 square feet each . Zippered portholes let you access gear stashed in them from inside the tent and keep clutter out of the doorways . And with two vestibules of equal size , there 'll be no more squabbling over your partner 's mess . Space You wo n't go stir crazy on stormbound days , thanks to twin doors , length and headroom for 6-plus-footers , and pole " knees " that push the walls outward to pump up interior volume . Ventilation Opposing doors allow you to adjust venting , and mesh in the walls and ceiling increase air movement . Condensation was never an issue , even on a soggy Rainier trek . LOWS Pitching The tent 's three asymmetrical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slower models to pitch , in all configurations . Weight The space and strength add ounces ; it 's among the heavyweights in all , modes . Features Storage pockets are limited and the doorways are small . ( 707 ) 544-4590 ; www.marmot.com . Header service #101 . THE NORTH FACE SALAMANDER 23 OVERALL : 4 No more crouched camping . This tent 's big interior lets you live large . HIGHS Space Beaucoup floor space and headroom make this our favorite for extended games of rummy 500 . The floor plan is not as long as the Duolite 's , but there 's plenty of length for 6-footers and the rectangular shape maximizes elbowroom . Pitching Color-coded grommet tabs and poles , combined with clips and a pole sleeve , make for a relatively fast pitch for a three-pole tent ( in all configurations ) , especially in dark and stormy conditions . Strength The taut , three-pole structure never rattled , even in gusty hail and rainstorms along Utah 's Green River . Likewise , the rainfly-only pitch is drum tight and strong against wind . Features @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the twin doors are at opposite corners , which makes exit/entry easier when sleeping head-to-foot . Ventilation Like other models with opposing doors and mesh panels in the walls and ceiling , there 's plenty of air flow . LOWS Vestibules You 'll have to draw straws to see who gets the good vestibule . While one is spacious enough for a pack and overflow gear , the other is a boots-only afterthought . Plus the two-zipper , roll-up door on the larger vestibule is fussy to operate . Durability In regular use , both the canopy and rainfly sustained small tears . Weight It 's almost 5 pounds in fly-only mode . ( 800 ) 362-4963 ; www.thenorthface. com . Reader service #102. $259 ; 40 sq . ft. ; 6 lbs . 10 oz. ( fly-only : 4 lbs . 15 oz. ) ; footprint : $30 ; 12 oz . L.L. BEAN DUOUTE OVERALL : 3.8 If Warren Buffett starts camping , he 'll buy this tent : solid performance , sensibly priced . $199 ; 40 sq . ft. ; 6 lbs . 14 oz. ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : $25 ; 11 oz . HIGHS Space The Duolite has the longest floor plan in the test ( 102 inches ) , with excellent headroom and decent width , giving it an amazingly roomy feel . The tent comfortably housed one tester with his wife , two toddlers , and chocolate Lab . Pitching Two poles joined by a pair of fixed hubs and attached with clips make setup in any configuration a snap . Stability The crossing pole design is impervious to wind whichever way the tent 's facing . Ventilation Four vents and opposing doors provide the group 's best air flow . Even with five warm bodies crammed in ( see above ) , there was zero condensation . Vestibufes The two vestibules , while not as big as the Marmot 's , are symmetrical and accommodate boots and overflow gear . Rainfly-only It 's the fastest to pitch and kept us dry through surprise rainstorms from New England to Canyonlands National Park . LOWS Wet exits The angle of the doors and rainfly allow rain inside the tent during stormy exits . Strength While none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . The Duolite 's flat roof collected wet snow and sagged in Oregon 's Three Sisters Wilderness . Staking The pitch is taut , but it requires a half-dozen more stakes than other models . Weight All that space makes it the heaviest tent in the test . ( 800 ) 809-7057 ; www.llbean.com . Reader service #103 . DANA DESIGN LITTLE NUKY OVERALL : 3.5 This unorthodox tepee is the lightest in the test by pounds . HIGHS Weight The Little Nuky has by far the best space-to-weight ratio in the test , because it pitches with a pair of trekking polesone for the shelter , one for the optional roll-back vestibule-instead of standard tent poles . Rainfly Not only is it the lightest in fly-only mode , it 's the roomiest as well-a third person could sleep under the spacious vestibule . But it lacks a floor ; all others pitch with a custom-fit groundclothlike footprint ( sold separately ) . Pitching Though setup is more cumbersome than others ( see below ) , the inner tent clips into the fly , which keeps the canopy drier when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's surprisingly stable for a pyramid-type shelter . It withstood a windy hailstorm in Yosemite . LOWS Space In full setup , it 's cramped for anyone over 6 feet . With one center pole , the walls lean inward , limiting headroom and dividing the floor awkwardly . Ventilation The condensation-prone pyramid has no vents . The walls were dripping after a mild night near the New England coast . Staking Good ground and careful staking are required to avoid flapping , and of course the use of trekking poles for structure means it 's not freestanding. ( 888 ) 357-3262 ; www.danadesign. com .

( fly-only : 3 lbs . 14 oz. ) ; footprint : $44 ; 12 oz . HlGHS Weight Looking for a compromise ? This is the lightest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while it 's not as svelte as the Dana , it 's considerably roomier in canopy mode . Pitching The two-pole design is fast and intuitive to set up . With color-coded grommet tabs and clips , it rivals the L.L. Bean for quickest pitch . Ventilation Opposing doors with circular zips allow you to micromanage ventilation . Doors SD 's trademark Stash doors provide gaping holes for easy entry/exit and tuck conveniently away . LOWS Space While its headroom allowed partners to sit face-to-face , its elbowroom came up short compared to the test 's larger models . Vestibules One vestibule has decent space , but the doorway let in rain during entering/exiting . The other vestibule is barely big enough for boots , and the fly is too far off the ground to keep out wind : One tester shivered through cold New England nights . Durability The vestibule zippers snagged repeatedly , an annoying hassle but also a bad omen in terms of durability . Strength The pitch is n't very taut , and a roof low spot collects water and snow . The fly-only mode , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 800 ) 635-0461 ; www.sierradesigns.com . Reader service #125 . THREE In One These versatile designs let you take only as much tent as you need . Whether it 's unruly October or benign July , these tents pitch in different configurations : full setup ; just the inner tent with poles ; or just the rainfly with poles and a footprint ( sold separately ) . Mix and match wisely , and you can reduce your shelter weight by pounds without buying three tents . Use these guidelines in deciding which parts to pack . 1 Use the rainfly-only setup when : Bugs and extreme cold are n't a worry ( autumn in many places ) , but precipitation is possible . The rainfly alone serves like a taut , easy-to-pitch tarp , and without the canopy it has extra space-enough for a third sleeper in a pinch . Just be sure to choose a site where water wo n't pool . 2 Use the canopy-only setup when : There 's no chance of rain but A plenty of mosquitoes . The tents reviewed here are good options in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesh to prevent stuffiness. 3 Use the entire tent when : Foul weather is possible anytime . In prolonged rain and cold , you 'll want the added security of a bathtub floor , the convenience of walled off vestibules , and the insulation of both canopy and fly .
