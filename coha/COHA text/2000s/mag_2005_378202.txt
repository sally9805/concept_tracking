Steven Johnson is a very intelligent man who frittered away much of his youth on TV , movies and video games . You kids out there would be wise to do the same . In Everything Bad Is Good for You : How Today 's Popular Culture Is Actually Making Us Smarter ( Riverhead Books ; 238 pages ) , the social critic and technologist ( Mind Wide Open ) makes a thought-provoking argument that today 's allegedly vacuous media are , well , thought provoking . <P> First , we should clarify what Johnson means by " good . " Unlike many critics of media  --  especially media aimed at kids  --  Johnson is not using the term in its moral or social sense . He 's not arguing whether reality TV humiliates people , video games promote violence or movies glorify sex . Instead he wants to know whether it gives the brain a good " cognitive workout . " For Johnson , pop culture is like algebra class . Whether you remember the quadratic equation as an adult is less important than whether you learned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Johnson , what matters about pop culture is not its message but whether it forces you to engage in complex thought , analysis and reasoning . <P> His conclusion : it does , and shockingly well , an impression that struck him one rainy day when he taught his nephew , 7 , the video game SimCity and soon found the kid making suggestions about industrial tax rates . Video games , Johnson notes , impel us to learn because playing them means not just following rules but also discovering what the rules are . And these rules can be staggeringly complicated . Johnson unpacks the nested objectives of just one segment of a Zelda video game with enough detail to bury the canard that it is " passive " entertainment . <P> That argument , Johnson emphasizes , " does not mean that Survivor will someday be viewed as our Heart of Darkness or Finding Nemo our Moby-Dick . " Rather , apples to apples , today 's pop media are far more challenging than yesterday 's . The Sopranos ' interlaced plots make Hill Street Blues look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and story lines than did Bambi . And supposedly mindless shows like The Apprentice are graduate seminars compared with ' 70s trash like The Love Boat , requiring us to parse webs of relationships , motives and strategies . In today 's media , says Johnson , " even the crap has improved . " <P> Today 's pop culture , he writes , builds on rules established by earlier pop culture ( as , say , The Simpsons complicated the sitcom genre ) . And new formats such as dvds make audiences more receptive to complex creations that reward repeat viewing or playing . A traditionalist could say that new media are simply good at teaching kids to use new media , but Johnson argues persuasively that they also force kids " to think like grownups : analyzing complex social networks , managing resources , tracking subtle narrative intertwinings , recognizing long-term patterns .
