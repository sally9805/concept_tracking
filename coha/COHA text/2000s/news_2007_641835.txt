<p> On a bluff at more than 11,000 feet on a Prospect Gulch mountainside , a crowd of scientists and land managers is scanning slopes where craggy piles of tailings and slouching buildings pinpoint Silverton 's mining history . <p> " Amazing , " they say again and again as they marvel at the grit of prospectors who struggled up black-diamond pitches to build and operate the Galena Queen , the Hercules , the Lark , the Henrietta and other mines perched in aeries along this gold- and silver-laden gulch . <p> But there is also a modern-day story of mettle at these mines . The fleece-swaddled crowd that recently bounced up here in four-wheel drives has helped undo the complex , toxic legacy of the mines and , in the process , made San Juan County a national model in a state where less than a third of the estimated 23,000 abandoned operations have been reclaimed or safeguarded . <p> For the past decade , government agencies and organizations along with a band of Silverton residents have worked together to clean up and close up - but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The industry put the high-mountain town of 450 year-round residents on the map in southwestern Colorado , and gave it an economic base for nearly a century . It was a blessing and a curse : The mines left it with polluted water and soil but now help fuel its tourist industry . <p> " One of the big things people come here for is these mines , " said Rod Sweet , who drives tourists up vertical hairpins to the mines for Thin Air Mountain Tours . " We would have nothing to talk about if they were n't here . " <p> On the 10th anniversary of the joint Abandoned Mine Lands program , launched by the Bureau of Land Management and the U.S. Forest Service , residents like Sweet have a lot to talk about . <p> Almost a Superfund site <p> The 145-square-mile Animas River watershed surrounding Silverton was one of several chosen in 1997 to be a national pilot project for mine remediation . The others were a watershed in Montana and , later , land in southeastern Utah . <p> But Silverton was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tailings piles , dumps and other features dotting the slopes that heave up outside the windows of every building in town . <p> The area is webbed by three large streams - Mineral Creek , Cement Creek and the upstream portion of the Animas River - and their tributaries . <p> In addition to the dangers of open shafts , tailings piles so toxic they could melt shoelaces , discarded explosives , flooded tunnels and caving structures , the water percolating through the mines and their waste was loading Silverton 's streams with acids , metals and minerals . Sometimes they flowed with what looked like orange Kool-Aid or dirty chocolate milk . Fish could n't survive . <p> It was bad enough that the Environmental Protection Agency was poised to declare the entire Silverton watershed a Superfund site . That would have brought massive cleanup and a flow of federal funding , but also a stigma . <p> Silverton would have been as well-known for toxicity as it is for the famous narrow-gauge train that chugs into Blair Street from Durango each day . <p> " I was scared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They were charging in here and saying , ' We 're going to clean up your water and tear down your mines . " ' <p> Silverton residents had already decided they would rather take on the complex responsibility for cleaning up their own home than have the federal government take over . In 1994 , three years after the last mine shut down , they formed a stakeholders group . It eventually came to include the Forest Service , BLM , EPA , U.S. Geological Survey , Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and 26 other entities that , in some cases , had already been cataloging Silverton 's problems and lobbying for change . <p> Polarized to energized <p> The group started with one primary rule : " You could n't say , ' You 're crazy , you do n't know what you 're talking about , " ' recalled Steve Fearn , a longtime mine manager . <p> Fearn said that initially , the group was split between longtime Silverton residents who believed the problem was so huge they might as well not try , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into pristine wilderness . <p> The group came together somewhere in the middle during the long winter months that sometimes leave the town cut off by avalanches . Members sorted through the crazy quilt of more than 3,000 mining claims on federal and private lands and prioritized 400 sites needing the most work . They found that 67 of those sites contributed 90 percent of the contamination that dumps into the Animas River before it cuts through Silverton . <p> They also found lead-laden soil along the river where town youngsters liked to whip up dust clouds with ATVs . They found iron-steeped bogs and open gashes - the remnants of a chimney style of drilling ore from mountainsides . They found old boardinghouses and mining cabins buckling into kindling . <p> And they found common goals . <p> " The big ticket on this whole approach was that rather than go down a litigious path , we could go about this in a more informal partnership effort , " said George Stone , BLM senior abandoned mine lands specialist . Stone came from Washington , D.C. , recently to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way in an excellent program that gets the most bang for the buck . " <p> About 50 projects have been completed , some with the aid of local volunteers and contractors . That was cause for a recent celebration that brought more than 100 people from as far away as Alaska , Montana and Washington , D.C. , for some backslapping and scientific inquiry . <p> Rivers give proof of life <p> As attendees discussed conductivity profiles , metal transports and altered bedrock , some guests of honor squiggled in a plastic tray at the Kendall Mountain Community Center . The invertebrates , dipped from a Silverton creek , were a demonstration that some of the waterways around Silverton are cleaner . Further proof : In 2005 , a healthy trout was found just downstream from Silverton . When cleanup efforts began , aquatic life was nearly nonexistent . <p> The town also has a new museum tour to show for all the efforts . The Mayflower Mill , which was a festering reminder of ore processing , has been cleaned up and declared one of 20 National Historic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducts summer tours there . <p> Tourists who venture farther and higher see , but probably do n't recognize , the very complex modern-day work that has gone on at the mines . <p> Alongside the photogenic warped buildings clinging to slopes , tailings piles have been wrapped , covered or moved . Materials have been hauled up and down precariously steep roads . Sinkholes have been filled in . Shafts have been covered , ditches lined , drain pipes installed , timothy grass planted on former waste areas . Buildings have been shored up by carpenters dangling on ropes over breath-stopping pitches . <p> The cost for all the cleanup has been about $30 million . If the area had been tagged for a federally mandated Superfund cleanup , the price tag would have been about $200 million . <p> " We do n't want to lay claim to be the gods of cleanup , " said Bill Simon , a Silverton ecologist and coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders group since its inception . " But we sure hope the process has helped . " <p> Simon pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is awaiting hoped-for federal changes in a mining law that dates back to 1872 . Changes being discussed could put more pressure on mining companies to clean up after themselves and lessen liability for groups such as the stakeholders as they do cleanup on private lands . <p> Carol Russell , former co- <p> chairwoman of the EPA 's National Mining Team , said what 's happened already is inspiring . <p> " The technical aspects of what we are doing here is similar to what was done in mines of the past , " she said . " It 's courageous . " <p> Nancy Lofholm : 970-256-1957 or nlofholm@denverpost.com <p> " We do n't want to lay claim to be the gods of cleanup . But we sure hope the process has helped . "
