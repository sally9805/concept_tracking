Look ! " Janie called out . " She 's wearing it , Mrs. Garcia . Mommy 's wearing the bracelet . " <p> Carmen Garcia glanced up from gathering the child 's shiny brown hair in a ponytail . The middle-aged woman leaned forward to get a better look at the image on the television screen . Eliza Blake , clad in a cornflower-colored blouse that complemented her blue eyes , was smiling from the set of KEY to America as she and a cookbook author demonstrated how to organize a summer barbecue . As the camera cut to a close-up of her hand rubbing a mixture of spices on the meat , the red , yellow , and blue plastic beads that encircled her wrist came into clear view . <p> " Sf . " Mrs. Garcia smiled . " Your mam likes the bracelet you made at camp very much . " <p> " How do you say ' bracelet ' in Spanish ? " Janie asked . <p> " Pulsera , " Mrs. Garcia answered . " Now , hurry . Eat your breakfast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janie , wearing navy blue shorts and a white Camp Musquapsink T-shirt , took a seat at the kitchen table while Daisy , the yellow Labrador retriever , positioned herself at the child 's feet . Janie dutifully ate the cereal and chunks of cantaloupe that Mrs. Garcia had put out for her while the housekeeper consulted the calendar hanging on the refrigerator door . <p> " It 's Native American Day , " Mrs. Garcia announced . " You have archery and horseback riding . " <p> " I know , " said Janie , making a face . " I hate archery . It 's too hard . " <p> " The more you practice , the easier it will get . Do your best , mi hija . Just do the best you can . That makes your mam happy . " <p> " Bows and arrows are dumb , " declared Janie . " But we 're going to have our faces painted . That will be fun . " The little girl 's eyes widened with pride . " And you know what else ? Musquapsink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is ? " <p> " So is Ho-Ho-Kus , " Janie reported , proud that she could teach Mrs. Garcia something . " There are lots of Native American names around here . Pascack and Hackensack and Kinderkamack . My counselor told us . " <p> Mrs. Garcia watched proprietarily as Janie tackled her bowl of cereal . She was such a healthy-looking child . A light suntan and a sprinkling of freckles covered her cheeks and straight little nose . Her blue eyes sparkled , just like her mother 's did . Her permanent teeth seemed to be coming in white and , so far , straight . Her legs and arms , which protruded from the day camp uniform , were well-toned and sturdy . <p> Feeling Mrs. Garcia 's eyes on her , Janie looked up . " What are you staring at ? " she asked . " You , mi hija . I 'm staring at you , tesoro . " " What does that mean ? " asked Janie , not familiar with the Spanish word . " It means ' treasure , ' " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tesoro . She loves you more than anything . " <p> The black van cruised slowly on the gently winding road that rimmed the pond . Passing stately colonials and sprawling ranch-style homes separated by acres of rolling lawns and lush landscaping , the driver pulled over to a carefully chosen spot between two houses , confident that the van would not be visible from inside either dwelling . He turned off the engine . <p> " How ya doin ' ? " the driver called out his open window , lifting his paper coffee cup in salute to the workman who drove past in a red truck . In the weeks he 'd been staking out this neighborhood , the driver knew the last thing that would ever look out of place here was a service vehicle . Every morning , landscapers , painters , electricians , and carpenters traveled through the quiet streets on their way to their jobs of maintaining the homes of the wealthy . The homeowners worked on Wall Street or were officers of major corporations or had successful companies of their own . They did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to spend their weekends making home improvements . They hired people to do those things . His van would n't be noted as out of the ordinary at all . In fact , in all the days he had been canvassing the neighborhood , not once had any of the patrolling police cars stopped him . The driver glanced at his watch . Anytime now . He sipped his lukewarm coffee and waited , keeping his eyes trained straight ahead at the brick Federal-style colonial way down at the end of the road . <p> " They 're late this morning , " he muttered . " Would n't you know they 'd be late this morning ? " <p> Finally , the yellow minibus came into view . " There it is , " he said , crushing the empty cup in his hand . " There 's the bus . " <p> The driver reached out to turn the key in the ignition . <p> " Hold on , " said a voice from the back of the van . " Do n't rush it . We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we want to do this thing right . " <p> The horn of the camp bus sounded . <p> Janie took a last swallow of milk , wiped her mouth with the back of her hand , and wrapped her arms around her dog 's neck for one more hug . She ran to the front door and waited for Mrs. Garcia to enter the code to disarm the home-security system . Mrs. Garcia stood guard in the open doorway until Janie had safely boarded and the bus drove away . <p> The housekeeper went back to the kitchen , cleared the bowls , cups , and silverware from the table and put them in the dishwasher . As she stood at the sink and washed her hands , Mrs. Garcia looked out the window , noticing that the geraniums were sorely in need of deadheading . She unlocked the French doors , slid back the screen , and walked out onto the slate patio . After she had separated the brownish buds from the white , healthy ones , Mrs. Garcia returned to the kitchen to drop the spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy , " Mrs. Garcia said , filling the dog 's bowl with water . " Let 's get you outside . " <p> The yellow Lab followed the housekeeper out to the rear of the property where a shingled doghouse was positioned under a canopy of leaves . Mrs. Garcia put the bowl of water on the ground and hooked a long leash , designed to provide a wide range of movement , to the dog 's collar . <p> Then , Mrs. Garcia went back into the house , pulling the screen door shut but leaving the French doors open to let in some fresh summer-morning air . <p> The black van pulled directly into the driveway , coming to rest at the side of the house . Two figures dressed in overalls and work boots emerged . They walked purposefully around to the backyard , pausing to pull latex masks over their heads . <p> " All set ? " hissed the smaller of the two from behind an Olive Oyl mask that sported beady eyes and jet black hair pulled back in a bun . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thumb . " Yep , " he said firmly . " We are n't leaving anything to chance . I 've been watching her for weeks and , on nice days , she leaves the back door open in the morning . " <p> A dog started barking from the rear of the property . The yellow Lab ran toward them but was pulled back as the leash became taut . <p> " Do n't worry . That damned dog is always barking , " said Popeye . " The housekeeper is n't going to think anything of it . " <p> Silently , Olive Oyl slid back the screen door . From inside the house , the telephone rang . Carefully and quietly , they followed in the direction of the voice that answered . <p> " Sf , Mrs. Blake . Janie got off to camp all right . " Mrs. Garcia 's voice could be heard coming from upstairs . <p> The intruders made their way to the staircase . <p> " Everything is fine here . " The housekeeper 's voice sounded louder . They climbed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you when you get home , Mrs. Blake . " <p> Mrs. Garcia put the phone back in its cradle . She finished making the bed , fluffing the pillows and smoothing the coverlet . As she straightened up , she glanced in the mirror over the double dresser and saw two masked figures approaching her from behind . <p> Mrs. Garcia lunged for the table at the side of the bed , but before she could reach the security button designed to summon help , Popeye pulled her back and threw her onto the mattress . Olive Oyl joined in , helping to pin her down . Together , they flipped Mrs. Garcia over so that she was lying with her face pressed against the coverlet , her air supply blocked . Using all her strength , the housekeeper struggled to free herself . <p> " Do n't fight me , lady , " said Popeye as he tied Mrs. Garcia 's arms behind her back . " Save your energy . You 've got a long day ahead of you . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
