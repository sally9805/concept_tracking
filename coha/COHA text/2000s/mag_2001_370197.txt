The logo for the Bloomington Early Music Festival at Indiana University features J.S. Bach in a plaid shirt standing in a cornfield next to a signpost listing the distances to Tucson , Ariz. ; Leipzig , Germany ; and Bloomington . The 14 concerts of medieval , Renaissance , baroque and classical music include works performed by adults on period instruments as well as a recital by elementary school students making a " joyful noyse " on recorders . Such whimsy has made a convert of Mia Dalglish , 16 , a student at Bloomington High School South . " Early music can be stiff and boring  --  or the most beautiful music in the world , " she says . The festival keeps prices down so that folks can enjoy baroque without going broke . An all-inclusive ticket to the festival , which runs May 19 to 28 , costs $55 to $60 , and tickets to individual events cost just $6 to $12 . <P> Other colleges in the area include the University of Indianapolis and Butler University in Indianapolis and Purdue in West Lafayette . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
