Running for the School Board // Family : // Glenn ( 53 ) , Ann ( 52 ) , Judith ( 18 ) , Rebecca ( 10 ) . // Location : // Alexandria , Virginia . // Best advice : // Relax and make learning fun . // Worst advice : // Follow the steps in The Well-Trained Mind . ( This is not to discount the many useful resources and ideas in the book ; just to say that while the theory is enticing , the practice is overwhelming. ) // Favorite quote : // " To laugh often and much , to win the respect of intelligent people and the affection of children , to earn the appreciation of honest critics and endure the betrayal of false friends , to appreciate beauty , to find the best in others , to leave the world a bit better , whether by a healthy child , a garden patch , or a redeemed social condition : to know even one life has breathed easier because you have lived . This is to have succeeded . " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Math by Hake and Saxon , Saxon Publishing . // History of US series by Joy Hakim , Oxford University Press Children 's Books . // Literature-Based Reading series , International Fair ( Grand Rapids , Michigan ) . // Critical Thinking Skills series , Remedia Publications ( Scottsdale , Arizona ) . // " Real books " from the public library . // Some people leave their public school system and never look back ; this was n't true for Glenn S. and his wife , Ann . The couple fought to keep their daughter in their neighborhood school until they finally felt forced out by bureaucratic indifference . // The family had long been at odds with their local public school administration , beginning with its push to create full-day kindergarten classes several years previously . The pervasive attitude at that time was summed up in a quote from the then head of early childhood education : " No matter how enriching the home environment , the public schools still know best how to educate your child . " Ann and Glenn thought that they , as parents , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firmly believed that a five-year-old child with a parent at home did not need to be in school all day . When the school converted to full-day kindergarten , the couple worked with a sympathetic principal and together arranged a half-day program for Rebecca within the system . // By the time Rebecca was ready to enter third grade , " some administrative personnel had changed , but the attitudes had n't , " Ann says . " Because of redistricting , many in our daughter 's rising third-grade class were slated to attend three different elementary schools in three years . " The prevailing quote now became , " Only parents are bothered by such moves ; the children adjust fine . " // After several attempts to work with the school , Ann and Glenn pulled Rebecca out of her class . " Children are not ping-pong balls , to be batted about at will , " says Glenn . " Our efforts to put some common sense into administrative decisions affecting the education of children became time consuming and frustratingly unsuccessful . It was time to go . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we could n't afford the private schools in the area . So homeschooling became our only alternative . " // Rather than simply walk away , though , Glenn ran for the school board . He felt he could n't leave without making a statement about how the city 's schools were chasing good people away and failing those who remained . // " The decision to homeschool our daughter after second grade was for her sake , " Ann says . " The decision to run for school board was for the sake of others who did n't have that option . " Glenn 's slogan was " Put children first . " His goals were to increase the administration 's responsiveness to parental concerns , to heighten the role of parents as partners  --  rather than as enemies  --  in the education process , and to awaken the community to the detrimental effects that frequent school changes have on student achievement . While Glenn lost the race , through his efforts and that of others , positive changes were made . Children in Alexandria are no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and third grades . // Ann , a freelance writer for the Washington Post , educational associations , and other clients , is now Rebecca 's primary teacher . Glenn continues in his work for the General Services Administration in Washington , D.C. , where he is a writer and editor who works on internal communications ; he also has the role of Rebecca 's history teacher . Big sister Judith , who graduated from a private school and is attending college , helps teach when she is available . // Rebecca , ten , is " the proverbial little girl with a touch of tomboy , " Ann says as she smiles . " She loves dolls and anything pink , but she says her goal is to become a catcher for the Baltimore Orioles . " Rebecca is in fourth grade of the Perky Pelican School , her self-named homeschool , complete with flag and stationery . The school song , composed by Rebecca , is sung to the tune of " You Are My Sunshine " : // I love my homeschool , // My Perky Pelican School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . // I love my homeschool // My Perky Pelican School // It 's fun , it 's cool , and it 's // Why I sing this song . // I do experiments // And I learn history // I read a lot // Which makes me glad ! // I 'm taught by Mommy , // And my sister , Judy , // And even my // Grumpy ol ' dad . // As Ann began her second year of teaching in the Perky Pelican School , her said goals remained the same as when she began . " All education should be geared to helping children become independent , lifelong learners , " she says . " Rather than memorizing a bunch of disconnected facts , children should be taught how to find any information they need and how to tell when they need more information . In addition , my job is to show my daughter the myriad of wonders that are out there ; hers is to latch on to her passion and take it as far as she can . " // Rebecca enjoys homeschool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a subject , " Ann says . " In public school she said that as soon as they got into something interesting , it was time to rush off to another activity . " // They do maintain a daily routine , however . " My daughter gets up around six A.M. on her own , so I have an assignment waiting on her bulletin board , " Ann says . " Morning homework , we call it . I 'm up by seven , and we must be dressed before the school day starts : no lessons in p.j.s . " Mom and daughter take a brisk walk to get their circulation going , and then return to " work . " This might include reading about a particular topic , doing experiments , writing for Rebecca 's monthly newsletter , or filling out work sheets . // " Work sheets have never been a learning tool that worked for me , but Rebecca loves them , " Ann says . " I 've made it a point to seek out the most challenging in various subjects . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workbooks , where the answer is found word for word in the accompanying passage . Rebecca needs to be encouraged to think and read between the lines . " // Ann has found tools such as the Literature-Based Reading series , books that base questions and activities on well-loved books at each grade level , to be a good compromise between her desire for discussion-oriented learning and Rebecca 's love of workbooks . Ann also likes the Critical Thinking Skills series . " Their exercises in comparison , analysis , and application fit in well with our goals for Rebecca , " she says . // The family enjoys playing games with an educational twist , such as Chronology , in which players demonstrate their knowledge of when things happened in history ; Made For Trade , a game about buying , selling , and bartering in colonial days ; and Chatter Matters , to help stimulate conversation on family traditions , goals , and special moments . // Rather than following a packaged curriculum , Ann assembles a variety of tools to help Rebecca grasp a concept or subject . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ research specific topics and narrow down good resources , " she says . " We belong to several homeschooling boards and find the interactions between members to be invaluable in exploring effective ways to approach any subject . " Ann also pulls resources from the library and a local teacher 's store . Virginia 's Standards of Learning serve as a guide to what is covered in each grade , but Ann thinks of them only as a guide . She uses one textbook , Saxon Math . // Many activities are hands-on , accommodating Rebecca 's visual learning style . One of her favorite parts of her language arts program , for example , is diagramming sentences . " Her writing has improved tremendously because of the way she can visualize how words relate to each other , " Ann says . " We use the Frank Schaeffer Basics First series . The exercises are clear and easy to follow . " // Instead of simply reading about geography , Ann and Rebecca use globes and maps regularly each day . " Rebecca automatically looks up places we hear or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road trips  --  whether around town , to a nearby community , or to another state , " Ann says . " One of the most enjoyable resources we used was a free ' What Do Maps Show ' program offered by the US Geological Survey in Washington , D.C. A variety of excellent maps give students experience in reading different types of maps  --  topographic , road , or relief . " // Rebecca studies Hebrew in her twice-a-week Sunday school classes . " We practice Reform Judaism and find homeschooling to be a natural extension of the faith , " Ann says . " A basic tenet of Judaism is to question in order to understand , to look at ideas from many different perspectives . We encourage our daughters to think it through to reach a genuine understanding of the subject at hand . " // " We do n't want our children to accept things blindly , " Ann continues , " but rather , as Judaism teaches , to reach for the real meaning of things . " The family studies religions other than their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fascinating to see what others believe and what binds them to their individual faiths , " Ann says . " We 've taught our daughters that the religious label one claims is not as important as the way one lives . My favorite illustration is from the Hindu philosophy , that religion is like a giant mountain . There are hundreds of paths up the mountain , all leading in the same direction , so it does n't matter which path you take . The only one wasting time is the one who runs around and around the mountain , telling everyone else that his or her path is wrong . " // One of Glenn 's passions is history , and he is very active in homeschooling his younger daughter in the subject . His schedule allows him to have one day off every other week , so he uses that day for Rebecca 's history lessons . " Glenn really makes the subject come alive , " Ann says . " He has studied extensively and has an envious ability to recall unique facts about historical figures , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people in mankind 's past . For example , rather than just talk about Longstreet 's role in the Civil War , Glenn can visually put you there with his description of the general 's hulking bear size and piercing blue eyes . " Glenn has found this descriptiveness , plus reading some of the best historical fiction , helps Rebecca grasp not only historical concepts , but the emotions , fears , and triumphs of each time period . // Ann thinks traditional history textbooks are deadly . Instead , to instill a passion for the subject in the girls , Ann and Glenn have relied on historical fiction and classics such as Johnny Tremain . They use primary sources found in local museums and collections , as well as history anthologies such as The Story of Mankind by Hendrik Willem Van Loon and a 1951 version of The Heritage of America by Henry Commager and Allan Nevins . Rebecca enjoys the writing in the History of US series by Joy Hakim . A typical ten-year-old , she likes to let her imagination flow back through time by curling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Royal Diary series . // The family spent six months studying colonial history from Roanoke up to the Declaration of Independence . " Our location in the mid-Atlantic region is a big plus , because there are countless places to go to walk in the footsteps of historical figures , " Ann says . " We have Jamestown , Williamsburg , Valley Forge , Independence Hall , the Smithsonian , National Geographic , the National Archives , and a myriad of other museums and art galleries , all within easy reach . " // During their first summer homeschooling , Ann and Glenn concentrated on visiting places that helped bring their history studies alive . Rebecca became involved with a local living history group and participated in colonial reenactment programs . Alexandria offers a living history camp , taught by two women who call themselves " The Little Maids of History . " Bonnie Fairbank , one of the partners , says , " We 're not little , and we 're not maids , but we are here to clean up after bad history . " During weeklong sessions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personalities in American history and take campers through a hands-on program that highlights the political and social activities of a particular era , including its art , music , and customs . Students enjoy walking tours around Alexandria , one day learning about the first fire engines , another learning the difference between colonial , Georgian , and Victorian architecture , and so on . // Glenn and Ann cover history sequentially . " One thing that always troubled us about the public school approach to history was its disconnected thread , " Ann says . " In Virginia , third graders study ancient Egypt , Greece , and colonial Jamestown ! Some classes cover Jamestown at the beginning of the year , others at the end . The natural flow of history is lost . We believe it 's important in the younger years to give a child a sense of continuity , how one event or period in history led to another . We may not be on the same page with our school system , but we are striving to give Rebecca an in-depth look at the causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the family 's study and activities , Ann has little problem keeping up with state regulations . " They 're very basic , no-sweat requirements , " she says . " I have a B.A. degree and that 's all the state requires . When asked what curriculum I 'd follow , I said , ' the Virginia Standards of Learning , state-mandated tests , and common sense . ' No further questions were asked . " Ann makes sure that Rebecca is tested yearly . " I need to know where she stands in relation to her grade and I think testing is an important skill for kids to learn . There will be many times when children may have to be tested in life . " // Academic skills are important , but so are socialization skills . " I always laugh when people ask about socialization , " Ann says . " The hardest part about homeschooling in our area is limiting the group activities . Between Girl Scouts , dance , a choral group , pottery lessons , and her twice-weekly classes at our temple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just finished a Toastmasters public speaking course , where she gained confidence talking in front of a group . In the spring she plays softball with a local recreation team , and in the summer looks forward to a week or two of Girl Scout camp . // Rebecca interacts with more diverse ages and backgrounds now than she did in school . " Her second-grade class was seventy-five percent low-income minority , but as hard as we tried , we could not get any real interaction after hours , " Ann says . " Groups stayed in their own neighborhoods . Now my daughter does n't see that division . Her ' school ' group is comprised of children of many different ethnic and economic backgrounds , " ranging in age from six to the teens . " // The local homeschool support groups are very casual . That 's fine with Ann , who prefers not to get into the regulation and formal structure of one particular organization . " Here in the northern Virginia area we have numerous groups who share resources and event ideas , and who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ style , ' " Ann says . " All it takes is for someone to have an idea and take the lead in organizing an event . " // With other homeschoolers , the family has attended both theatrical and musical programs at the Kennedy Center ( about ten times a year rather than the one or two Rebecca got in public school ) , nature outings , or special classes that are hard for individual parents to conduct . Home-schoolers have organized pottery classes , salamander counts , tall-ship visits , camp-outs , and study skills groups . " It 's very easy for any parent who has a particular interest to post it on the computer boards , giving others who share the interest a chance to pool resources , " Ann says . " We 're currently hoping to organize a camp-out geared to eighteenth-century living , with no modern clothing or conveniences allowed . " // One thing that has troubled Ann in her still fledgling foray into homeschooling is the drop-off in participation during long-term activities . " Because homeschooling parents tend to be free-spirited , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only to abandon it when another interest takes root , " she observes . " That may be the down side to homeschooling : not giving children a sense of commitment to a group or activitiy . Some homeschoolers ' propensity to go with the flow  --  to drop an interest the minute it 's not exciting  --  may come back to haunt those children later in life . " // To cope with this , Ann and Glenn work hard to help Rebecca make choices , and to understand her responsibility to carry out her activities to their proper conclusion . Ann says piano lessons have helped tremendously in giving her daughter the ability to stick to it even through the tedious or slow times . // Ann finds homeschool " fabulous  --  exhausting but fabulous . It 's been more than I expected . I 've been surprised at how much we accomplish in a short period . And I 've been able to help my daughter , who is very shy , to gain a sense of control and confidence . We do all the same things we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that now we have time to enjoy them . " // The homeschooling life-style can be a challenge for Ann . " One of my biggest problem areas is that I have no time for other things , like basic chores , " she says . " Fortunately , I have a very helpful husband . Also , there are times when I do n't want the responsibility , when I have doubts about doing things right . But these are short-lived when I see how well my daughter is doing and how much she has grown intellectually . We will continue to homeschool until we think it 's not working . " // For support , Glenn and Ann rely on " great friends over the past thirty years who are thrilled with our adventure into homeschooling , " Ann says . Extended family are either deceased or absent from the family 's life , but " friends and former teachers support us enthusiastically , because they know what we went through in the school system . Ironically , some of our biggest supporters are the teachers and staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mailing list for Rebecca 's newsletter , and take the time to write her encouraging notes after each issue . So far , the fact that we are homeschooling has received minimal growls , maximum applause . " // When Ann and Glenn pulled Rebecca out of public school , their lives took a very different turn . Glenn 's run for the school board was based on the hope that one voice could help change a system badly in need of repair . Instead , the school system inadvertently did the family a favor . " We never would have considered homeschooling if we had n't been pushed into it , " Ann says . //
