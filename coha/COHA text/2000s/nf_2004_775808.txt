A DAY IN COURT // * * * // " DO YOU AFFIRM to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth ? " // I had never been at a jury trial before , much less in a witness box . My conservative religious upbringing had made me wary of such occasions , and especially the swearing of oaths . The judge , in agreement with the FBI , had not merely acquiesced to my own idiosyncracy ; on that August day in 1984 all the witnesses simply affirmed their intention to tell the truth . The defendant , once a seminary student , stood accused of carrying across a state line stolen property worth more than $5,000-specifically , a copy of Nicolaus Copernicus ' De revolutionibus . // Stolen book cases are quite rare in court . Most are settled by plea bargaining , if not before a trial begins , then immediately after the prosecution has demonstrated its seriousness by impaneling a jury . But in this case the defendant held a security clearance for his job , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that essential cachet. // I had watched the process of jury selection in the Washington , D.C. , federal district court with curiosity and increasing amazement . Challenges abounded . A distinguished-looking retired black police officer was summarily dismissed despite his long service on a grand jury . A grade-school librarian was challenged . Any possible appreciators of books were eliminated . It was all too clear that the defense was hoping that a jury with the least possible education would be the most sympathetic . // What happened next threw me into near panic . The defense lawyers moved that the witnesses be sequestered . I knew the word only from the 1 newspapers : When a jury is sequestered , the jurors are locked up in hotel rooms whenever they are out of the courtroom . I did not look forward to spending the duration of the trial incarcerated in a Washington hotel . I was relieved , but also annoyed , to discover that in this case the term merely meant that the witnesses could not hear each other testify . But in the end the strategy backfired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the jury knew we had n't been allowed to coordinate our replies to the questions . // After the opening statements , which I was not allowed to hear but which I found out about afterward , I was brought in as the first expert witness . The government attorney , Eric Marcy , began by asking me , " Who was Copernicus , and why was he important ? " // I explained that Nicolaus Copernicus was a great astronomer who is sometimes considered the father of modern science . He was born in Poland in 1473 , went to school in Cracow at the same time Columbus was setting sail to the New World , but did his important astronomical work in the 1500s . His great book , De revolutionibus , argued against the common belief that the Earth was solidly fixed in the middle of the universe . Instead , he proposed that the Sun was immovable in the middle , and that the Earth went around it , along with the other planets . In other words , he proposed the arrangement of the solar system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his book , first published in the year he died , 1543 , is such a landmark and is eagerly sought by collectors . // I was teeming with a lot of news about Copernicus , and I could have kept the jury there the rest of the morning , but before I could go farther Marcy thrust Exhibit A-a copy of De revolutionibus itself-into my hands . Had I ever seen this copy before ? // I informed the jury that for more than a decade I had been engaged in a study of Copernicus ' book , and that I had personally examined several hundred copies , looking for notes written in the margins by early owners . I quickly pointed out that the pages were originally sold as loose sheets , and that each owner had the book bound to his own tastes . Unlike modern books , which are as similar as peas in a pod , sixteenth-century books were each individually bound and distinctive . A popular binding , especially in Italy and France , was limp vellum , similar to the " sheepskins " that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over oak boards , generally with individual patterns rolled onto the material under considerable pressure . In England , and on the Continent as well , calf bindings over heavy cardboard were popular , usually with some pattern or another of scored rectangles . I carefully examined the book as if I had n't seen it in years ( though the FBI had refreshed my memory by showing it to me a few hours earlier ) , and then produced a binder of typescript sheets that I had carried to the stand with me. // " This copy is bound with a paper pattern on the sides , " I pointed out , " which is very unusual . It seems to match one that is currently missing from the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia . According to my notes , it was bought from Ars Ancienne , a Swiss firm specializing in rare books , and here is a penciled note reading ' AA , ' which matches that . My description also mentions that an earlier stamp has been erased from the title page , and here you can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bookplates have been removed from inside the front cover . One of them is horizontal , which is rather uncommon . I just happen to have examples of the Franklin Institute bookplates with me. // " With a flourish I produced the two bookplates , one vertical and the other horizontal , and demonstrated that they fit the rectangular glue marks like keys in their locks . The book was handed around to the jury . // Before I could go farther , Marcy turned to Exhibit B , a small yellow bookseller 's catalog from Old Printed Word in Washington . Had I seen this before ? // " Many people know I 'm searching for every possible copy of Copernicus ' book , and so in fact three years ago , in the summer of 1981 , a friend sent me a copy of this catalog . I saw at once that it included a De revolutionibus . It jumped right out at me , because , while most of the books on the list cost $50 or $100 , the Copernicus is offered at $8,750. " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // I replied that in 1971 I had made notes on the first- and second-edition copies at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia , but when I returned four years later to recheck several details , the second edition could n't be found . The description in the yellow catalog seemed to match the copy I knew was missing from Philadelphia , so I called the librarian at the Franklin Institute and suggested that he get in touch with the FBI . // The jury was spared some of the details of what had happened next . Emerson Hilker , the librarian , called the Philadelphia FBI ; but upon learning that the book had disappeared more than seven years before , the bureau promptly lost interest . The statute of limitations had passed and with it the possibility of a criminal suit for the theft of the book . Hilker rang back with this bad news , wondering what he should do next . " Can you make 100 percent sure that the book is ours ? " he asked me. // I told him that I could call the bookstore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A few additional details might be more definitive . So I phoned the Old Printed Word bookshop to inquire about getting the book . // " I 'm sorry , " the proprietor , Dean Des Roches , responded when I called him . He explained that the bookshop did n't actually own the book but simply had it on consignment , so he could n't send it on approval . But when I learned he actually had the book in the shop , I asked him to describe the condition of the title page more exactly . He fetched the book and told me the title page had a tiny wormhole , and then he added that it looked as if an oval library stamp had been erased. // That perfectly matched my notes , which recorded both the wormhole and the oval library stamp , so I called Hilker back , saying I was now completely convinced that the book was the Franklin Institute 's missing copy . // Only later did I learn from the Washington , D.C. , FBI what had transpired after the call from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Printed Word bookshop , declared that the book was theirs , and asked for it to be sent back . This thoroughly alarmed Des Roches , for he was already suspicious of the consignor and had wondered how the book had been obtained in the first place . On the other hand , if it had been acquired legitimately , he would have been liable for some thousands of dollars if he merely mailed the Copernicus back to Philadelphia . So he called the local FBI , explained what had happened , and mentioned that the consignor , John Blair , apparently had lots of other items in his Maryland home . // Although the original theft was safely beyond the statute of limitations , the transport of stolen goods across state lines was a federal felony and presumably more recent . If so , the clock had been set running again . // Feeling sure a felony was afoot , the FBI agents posed as book buyers and paid a visit to Mr. Blair . They confiscated hundreds of small trade catalogs , once considered almost throwaway items , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still bore the stamps of the Franklin Institute Library . Of special interest was a medical manuscript written by the famous colonial doctor from Philadelphia and a signer of the Declaration of Independence , Benjamin Rush . // Furthermore , it turned out that John Blair had been an employee of the Franklin Institute . It was well known in library circles that the institute had fallen on hard times , and it was rumored that the library was in a state of considerable confusion and with low security . The trade catalogs , for example , had been tied in bundles and crowded into the aisles of the stacks , so that users simply walked over them to get to the books . Many bundles had broken open , and hundreds of catalogs were strewn randomly in the aisles . When Blair claimed that the trade pamphlets were simply being thrown out by the institute , he had a defense that was potentially highly embarrassing to the library . Nevertheless , these titles were still listed in the library catalog , with no evidence that they had been thrown out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been discarded . // In the FBI 's opinion , the case was clear except for one small detail : The bureau was n't sure precisely when the Copernicus book had crossed the state line from Maryland into the District of Columbia . But when , in the opening statement , the defense lawyers had conceded that this had happened recently , the FBI agents out in the hallway were elated . It became clear that the proposed defense would take a completely different tack . // Because the defense had listed another bookseller as a witness , the prosecution had deduced that the attorney for the defense , Andrew Graham , would try to argue that the Copernicus book was worth less than $5,000 , in which case the crime would be a misdemeanor and not a felony . Had the book been a first edition , that would have been no defense , since copies were then selling for around $40,000 . With a second edition , as in this case , the situation was more ambiguous . I had been alerted to the possibility that the value might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had called a London dealer who had a second edition on offer just to check on the current price . // Eric Marcy ended my interrogation by asking how much Exhibit A , the Copernicus book , was worth . // Graham leapt to his feet at once . " Objection ! The professor is not a specialist in book pricing ! " // " Objection overruled , " announced the judge , who was no doubt as curious as the jury concerning what price an old book might fetch . // To give an idea of the book 's value , I cited several recent auction records . At an Amsterdam sale in 1978 a second edition had fetched $6,500 , and at a Munich auction three years later a copy had brought $9,000 . A few months earlier I had personally sold a copy to the library of San Diego State University for $6,800 . Again Graham objected , saying that the current price was irrelevant to the price a few years back ( when the supposed crime had occurred ) , and again he was overruled . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price of $12,500 . The present copy was not as good as the one in London , I admitted . After all , the defense had deliberately exhibited its wormholes to the jury . Once more Graham objected on the grounds that I was unqualified to price books , and this time the judge told him to stop interrupting me . Perhaps the asking price in the Old Printed Word catalog-that is , $8,750-was a little high , I said , but it seemed generally right . // Now it was time for a cross examination . Had I been informed , asked the defense attorney , that the book had to be worth at least $5,000 for a felony trial to continue ? Yes , I knew this , I said , because I had heard the charges read at the beginning of the trial . // With the air of someone about to play his trump card , Graham then asked , " When you discussed the various auctions , you did n't mention them all , did you ? For instance , what about the price of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago ? And what about their sale on April 30 , 1979 , where the copy went for only $3,500 ? " He looked very pleased , as if he had just punctured my credibility . // That 's true , I said , but it takes two to tango . If at a particular sale there is only one interested buyer , he can walk away with a real bargain , below the actual market value . I mentioned that I had recently seen the first copy he had cited , which was in a private collection in Italy . It had very interesting manuscript annotations , and if it were offered by a dealer , the price would have been several times higher than the auction bid . As for the other copy , it was very tattered , with pages browned and water-stained , which greatly diminished its value . // Being a competent defense lawyer making the best of a difficult situation , Graham did n't blanche but bravely carried on . " Have you ever taken a course in book appraising ? " // " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I ever taken a course in the history of science , even though I 'm Professor of the History of Science at Harvard . " // " Just answer my question ! " he snapped , but it was too late . Sub voce , the judge murmered , " He 's trying to . " // I was about to step down when the prosecutor rose for a final query . Marcy asked , " Have you ever communicated with members of the defense ? Have you ever refused to help them ? " // I responded that I had indeed spoken with Mr. Graham and answered his questions . He had asked me how I was sure that the book was the one missing from the Franklin Insitute , and I explained it in detail . With that I left the stand , rather awed by Marcy 's quick-witted ingenuity in framing that parting shot . //
