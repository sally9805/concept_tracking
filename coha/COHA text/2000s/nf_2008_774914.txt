" All the Books He Could Lay His Hands On " // 1809-1825 // At six years of age , for a few weeks in the fall of 1815 , in the town of Knob Creek , Hardin County , Kentucky , the boy went to his first school , taught by a typical frontier teacher commissioned by local parents to provide children with basic skills and only sufficiently knowledgeable himself to rise modestly above that level . Teachers were in short supply on the frontier that ran along the western ridge of the Appalachians ; beyond was the sparsely settled western portion of Ohio and the territories of Indiana and Illinois ; southward , much of the states of Kentucky and Tennessee . Cash also was in short supply . Material possessions were minimal . By modern standards it was a starkly rudimentary life . // In this community of Protestants the supremacy of the Bible as the book of daily life encouraged acquiring basic reading skills . Simple arithmetic came next . " His father , " the grown-up boy later recalled , " sent him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thorough education . And what do you think my father 's idea of a thorough education was ? It was to have me cipher through the rule of three . " Beyond that , education was a luxury that neither time nor money permitted . Intellectual curiosity in a society in which it had no likely practical reward was rare , except for the occasional child who , inexplicably , without any relation to who his parents were and what the community valued , was transfixed by the power of words . // Words and ideas were inseparable in a nation in which the Bible dominated . It was given full currency as the source of the dominant belief system . It was also the great book of illustrative stories , illuminating references , and pithy maxims for everyday conduct . More than any other glue , it held the society together , regardless of differences of interpretation among Presbyterians , Baptists , and Methodists . This was a world of believers . Here and there was a deist , an agnostic , or an atheist , but even those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did so within the tribal circle and expressed themselves in small deviances , such as not attending church regularly or at all . Deistic voices from afar , from the East Coast , from the Founding Fathers , even from Europe , occasionally could be heard in the Appalachian woods and beyond . The deists rationalized religion , eliminated mystery : there is a creator , a God ; otherwise , human beings are on their own , dependent on reason and action . But rural American Protestants in the nineteenth century much preferred miracle , redemption , brimstone , the literal truth of the Bible , and the apocalypse to come . As six-year-old Abraham Lincoln began to learn to read , his household text was the Bible . // His parents were fundamentalist believers , regular worshippers . Without education and illiterate , Thomas Lincoln was also blind in one eye and had weak sight in the other , which may have perpetuated his illiteracy . To sign his name , he made his mark . To worship , he recited and sang memorized prayers and hymns . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from others and especially on his memory , which was the agent of sacred prayer and biblical knowledge . Both literate and illiterate American Christians often memorized long stretches of the Bible . And as young boys like Abraham became literate , they developed their ability to remember . From an early age , Lincoln had a tenacious memory . By modern standards , few books were available to him . Those he could recite almost by heart . // His first teacher was his mother , who had learned to read but not write . Thin , slight , dark-haired , Nancy Hanks was born in 1783 in Virginia , the daughter of Lucy Hanks and an unidentified father . In 1806 , she married Thomas Lincoln . The next year , in Hardin County , Kentucky , where they had settled , she had her first child , Sarah ; on February 9 , 1809 , Abraham ; then another son , who died in infancy . Unlike her prolific Hanks predecessors and contemporaries , she was to have no more children . // What young Abraham learned from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his later testimony to the absence of family distinction , he gave short shrift to his father 's contribution to his upbringing . His stocky , muscular , dark-haired , large-nosed father , about six feet and almost two hundred pounds , seemed a Caliban of the carpentry shop and the fields . Thomas Lincoln 's illiteracy , though , was less remarkable to his son than what the boy took to be his father 's disinterest in learning to read and his lack of ambition in general . It left him a marginal man who at an early age had fallen out of the mainstream of American upward mobility , a plodder without ambition to rise in the world . But he had not been born to that necessity . The father that the young adult Lincoln knew had been substantially formed by circumstances , though for the son the totality was subsumed into a sense of his father 's character . It was not a character that he admired . And it was one that he needed later to distance himself from . Thomas Lincoln " was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but " a piddler-always doing but doing nothing great-was happy-lived Easy-and contented . Had but few wants and Supplied these . " // Both father and son knew less than modern scholars about the paternal family 's history , mostly because Thomas Lincoln had been cut off from much of his past . He knew only that his great-grandfather came from Berks County , Pennsylvania , to Rockingham County , Virginia , where his grandfather , the Abraham he named his son after , had four brothers . Everything before was lost in the haze of illiteracy and family tragedy . Actually , the first American Lincoln , Samuel , had emigrated from England to Massachusetts in the seventeenth century . A next generation had been Quakers in Pennsylvania , where Samuel 's grandson , Mordecai , had prospered . Mordecai 's son , John , became a well-to-do farmer in Virginia . And it was one of John 's sons , Abraham , who moved in the 1780s from Virginia to Kentucky with his five children , three of whom were sons , Mordecai , Joseph , and Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed by Indians . As his body lay in the field , ten-year-old Thomas sat beside it . An Indian ran out of the woods toward him . Fifteen-year-old Mordecai , concealed in the cabin , aimed and shot the Indian in the chest . It was the eponymous story of Thomas 's life , retold many times by a man who had a gift for narrative , got along with his neighbors , and attended church regularly . // Primogeniture gave his eldest brother the family possessions . The other sons were expected to move on . Thomas was not sent to school , even to learn arithmetic . A manual laborer as a teenager , then a carpenter , and then a farmer , he managed sustenance and little more . He made rough tables and cabinets on commission , built barns and cabins , made coffins . When he eventually acquired property , it provided mostly backbreaking work and disappointment . He had bursts of pioneer energy , resettling twice . Decent in every way , he struggled through life , gave no one any trouble , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished and , as he grew older , did only the irreducibly necessary . // In spring 1806 he had a glimpse beyond Kentucky . Hired to build a flatboat for a local merchant , he took it , loaded with goods , to New Orleans via the Ohio and Mississippi rivers . As a carpenter and day laborer , he accumulated enough cash to buy , soon after his son was born , almost 350 acres in Hardin County . He still owned some of the 200 he had purchased in 1803 , on Nolin River , near Hodgenville , called Sinking Spring Farm . Then , in 1811 , he bought 230 acres on Knob Creek , northeast of Hodgenville , to which he moved his family . On each farm , he built a one-room log cabin . So , too , did everyone else of his station and means , and the small commercial buildings of the local townships were identical , at most slightly larger . Thomas Lincoln 's land transactions , including promissory notes and delayed sales , had title and debt complications . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three or so years of what he could save from his earnings . It was not inestimable , given his start , but it left a narrow margin and next to no cash . // ( Continues ... ) //
