No tents ? No problem . These Scouts built their own snow town . // It 's late winter in the Wyoming Rockies . You 're at 8,000 feet , where the weather is n't bad but the snow is deep , and you do not have a tent . Time to dig in and dig out . That 's what 70 or so Scouts from six troops in Greeley , Colo. , did last March on their outing to Chimney Park Scout Reservation near Laramie . Under the guidance of snow shelter expert Bernie Kendall , the boys set to work on the shore of a frozen lake , excavating quinzees , snow caves and trench shelters . " It 's fun , but it 's hard work , " says First Class Scout Clifford Smit . There was time to goof around with the day 's zaniest events , the chicken kick and ice-bowling . But business came first . The boys built quinzees . Athabascans of the Far North invented these shelters , essentially snow mounds each with a cave carved in it . Following @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy part was getting there . Before the fun could start the Colorado Scouts patiently constructed snug snow shelters . // Cliff and other Scouts pulled on homemade snowshoes and stomped a snowy area to serve as a foundation for their quinzee . Custom Construction Knowing four Scouts would sleep in the quinzee , they lay side by side on the foundation , as if in their sleeping bags . One Scout drew a big circle around them , leaving two feet of room on all sides . Now they knew how wide to make the structure . Next they started shoveling a mound of snow about six feet high , occasionally giving the slowly rising dome a couple of shovel swats to firm up the pile . After about an hour , the mounds met the campers ' requirements . It was time to wait for the snow to set ( See " Snow Facts " sidebar . ) When the cold stuff was the right consistency , the Scouts dug a snow shelter out of the mound 's core . In all , the boys built seven quizees that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a high drift , and its firmness was just right for snow caves . Dan Burgess , his brother , Sam , 16 and 14 respectively , and their houseguest from Nepal , Sangam Napit , 16 , a Venturer , eagerly attacked the big drift . Photograph Hey , how do you get these things off ? ask Venturer Sangam Napit and Life Scout Sam Burgess at the Chimney Park Scout Reservation gate : Their snowshoes are home- : made , using PVC , plastic ties and radiator hose clamps. // They wanted the door to be lower than their sleeping platforms in order to trap their body heat in the cave . So the Scouts dug down first , then tunneled up into the drift about three feet . Taking turns , the boys squirmed through the narrow tunnel into the drift where they worked at hollowing out a living space . Each of the " snow moles " passed the excavated snow back to the others to be removed from the tunnel . They learned that the ideal snow cave interior is a steep-sided dome . Easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would be , " says Sam . When they saw the soft , blue light of day showing through the snow , they knew they 'd dug upward as far as they should . Their roof was about two feet thick . ( Had the day been cloudy , the Scouts would have inserted a stick two feet into the top of the drift , and then dug up until they reached its tip . ) Once the room was big enough , there was the option of carving shelves into walls to hold candles or keep camping gear off the floor . In one of the really big drifts , boys burrowed tunnels between their caves , turning the little mountain of snow into a Scout warren . Instant Shelter What happens if you camp late in the day and the weather 's bad and there 's no time to build either quinzees or snow caves ? At Chimney Park , Mr. Kendall demonstrated the basic trench shelter , which takes just a few minutes to finish . Dig a snow ditch about four feet by six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anchor the tarp 's corners with buckets of snow . Crawl inside and you 're home for the night The trench shelter is not as neat or as warm as a quinzee or cave , but it works .

Photograph Ice bowling : Scouts clear a path of snow on the lake and add some pins and a 12pound ball for a fun and competitive event // Once Snowville was built , the Scouts turned their attention to having fun . Out on the lake , two bowling lanes were scraped out , and a 12-pound ball was used to knock over the pins . In the chicken kick , Scouts donned snowshoes and tried sending a rubber chicken the farthest . It was n't very far-20 feet , max-but it was fun . " I think I kicked it backward . " says Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sled race . " We were lucky to be up against a bunch of little guys , " he says . Hunkering Down Such activity makes Scouts hungry . For dinner , everyone mixed their cans of chicken-based soup , and heated it all in a big kettle for " Group Soup . " Afterward , the quinzees and caves glowed by lantern lights on the inside . It was about 30 degrees inside the snow shelters , 5 or 10 degrees warmer than outside . It was , says Sam , " a lot warmer than a tent . " More fun , too . The snow walls blocked all sound , making each shelter quiet and peaceful . The Scouts zipped up their bags and settled in for the night , satisfied with ajob well done . " It was hard work , " says Cliff Smit , " but I 'd do it again ! " Sidebar EMERGENCY SUNGLASSES Sidebar Snowblindness is not true blindness ; it just feels that way . Sidebar In tact , your eyes have been sunburned , and they are so sensitive to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At Chimney Park the Scouts wore snow goggles or sunglasses to protect their eyes . But what happens if you lose this vital protection ? Cut a piece of cardboard into eyeglass shape , then cut slits to see , They wo n't admit enough light to hurt your eyes . Tie or tape the emergency sunglasses to your head . Ugly ? Yep . " I would n't wear them to school , " says Andrew Crandall , 11 , a Second Class Scout . But wearing them is better than being snowblind . Sidebar AVALANCHE SAFETY Sidebar The Scouts learned from expert Keith Burke that snow avalanches come in different forms . A powder or " sluff " avalanche starts at a single point and fans out as surface snow slides downhill . These avalanches are not as violent as slab avalanches . Slab avalanches are very dangerous . They occur when a whole hillside of snow breaks loose in a giant slab , which then breaks into snow blocks that tumble downhill faster and faster . Being hit by a block of snow can kill you or quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , try to stay on top by swimming , If you 're buried , cover your face with your hands to keep snow out of your nose and mouth . When the snow stops moving , immediately move your head around to make yourself breathing room until help arrives . // <p>
