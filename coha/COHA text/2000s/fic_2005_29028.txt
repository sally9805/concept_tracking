Chapter One It had to be the first bare navel on the Masters veranda . Luckily it came with a shapely adorable . Could have been a bulker . All in all , she was your basic tri-state crime-spree gorgeous . Make you try to eat corn through a chain-link fence , as Cary Grant or Fred Astaire used to say , or maybe it was Grady Don Maples . Picture this : a long-haired brunette babe poured into a pair of low-hanging stretch jeans looking like the same thing as one of those halftime college showgirls . She stood between the two big trees on the veranda . Her tummy was flat as a West Texas fairway , and she was wearing the minimum legal requirement of a white knit top . This helped her display two tickets that would easily gain her admittance to the hospitality tent at any golf tournament she 'd wish to attend . I should add that she also wore a clubhouse badge for the Masters . " Screen-saver , " Jerry Grimes said alertly . " Fire in both engines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . I do n't know that there 'd been too many sights at Augusta to equal that one . Usually the veranda was a gathering of geezers in their green jackets , scads of privileged folks sitting at tables under bright umbrellas , scattered groups of serious business execs looking worried about something , and assorted media intellectuals shopping around for scoops and scandals . As a rule , the serious business execs would be talking to each other , their hands clasped behind their backs while they rocked back and forth in their FootJoys . They could be equipment salesmen , they could be the dapper officials of various golf organizations , or they could be powerful sports agents , but if they were powerful sports agents their eyes would be darting this way and that , and they 'd have a tendency to bite their nails . Assorted wives of Tour pros frequently emerged from indoors-two lookers , say , and one bulker . They would have dined upstairs on the balcony , where they 'd discussed maladies , child-rearing , exercise classes , difficult mothers-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years . I was n't around when they were all needlepoint ladies , but I 'd been around long enough to see the lookers go from stately former yearbook favorites to Barbie dolls that could actually make noises like human beings talking . We 'd walked up on the roped-off veranda after our Tuesday practice round . I 'd smiled at the two security guards who were stationed there to keep out the K mart shoppers . That 's when we spotted the shapely screen-saver displaying her finest features . She was obviously at the magnolia joint for the first time . If she was trying to arouse any of the gentlemen on the veranda , she was making a mistake . Most of the veranda gentlemen were on the high side of sixty and were more likely to be aroused by the report of a new oversized driver that would give them fifteen more yards . Jerry Grimes said , " It 's too bad that lovely thing happens to be the asshole 's mother , Bobby Joe . " " That 's no mother , " I said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Betty Crocker . " " They do ? " " Cheerios . " " Mothers look like Cheerios ? " " Detergent ... type of thing . " Grady Don Maples said , " I guess she do n't crochet a lot , but she 's still the asshole 's mother . " " Which asshole ? " I said . " I have choices . " " Scott Pritchard , " Grady Don said . " That 's old Gwendolyn Pritchard , it sure is . Scott 's mom . Right there with her steel belly and her lung problem . Kill me first , Gwen . " " That 's the child star 's mother ? " I must have blurted it out . The dapper official of a golf organization glared at me . Guy in a dark blue blazer , white shirt , striped tie , red face . Looked like he knew for a fact that I ate with my hands . Some hasty arithmetic was called for . Scott Pritchard was nineteen , our newest phenom on the Tour-there seemed to be one every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome for his own good . He came out loaded with amateur titles , an average driving distance of 324 yards , a satchel of contracts too heavy to lift , and you could add the blank stare of a young Beverly Hills valet parker . His age meant the mom must have been a tap-in under forty , but she could play younger , as evidenced by this penetrating veranda moment . " Scott Pritchard 's a big kid , " I said . " He must get his size from the lumberjack who knocked her up . " " It could have been a tight end , " Jerry said . " Naw , tight ends do n't get laid by adorables , " Grady Don said . " I was a tight end in college . Might as well be a defensive tackle . Scrap around with the meece . " We were interrupted by a media celeb . It was Irv Klar , a sports columnist for the Washington Post , as in D.C. I 'd first known Irv as an aggressive young guy working for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book with me . Me being the first golfer he 'd ever met . I 'd dusted him off . But since then , while my back was turned , he 'd become a big-shot columnist and a best-selling author . Irv 's first bestseller was Speed Freaks : The Story of How the Nazis Invented Amphetamines to Win the ' 36 Olympics . When it came out I 'd seen Irv at a tournament and said , " Irv , I thought Jesse Owens won the Berlin Olympics , and the Nazis invented speed to keep their troops awake . " " That too , " he said . I 'd read almost all the way through the first chapter . Irv Klar had written two other bestsellers since . With time , I could remember the titles . He was always working on a new book . Irv was wearing baggy shorts , frayed sneakers , faded knit shirt , and an old Brooklyn Dodgers baseball cap , to prove he was a man with a sense of history . " Hey , guys , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm taking a poll for the column . " " Ben Hogan , " I said . " Ben Hogan ? " Irv frowned . " Ben Hogan 's dead . " " You 're shitting me . " " You do n't want to pick somebody serious ? " I said , " I 'll stick with Hogan . Dead , he 's already got me four back . " Irv said , " What about you two ? Grady Don ... Jerry ? " Grady Don said , " I 'll go with old dead Sam Snead . " Jerry said , " I 'll take Jimmy Demaret . He 's dead , too , is n't he ? " Irv had spunk . He said , " I thought y'all had to win something big before you got to be assholes ? " He walked away , shaking his head . " It 's on our list of things to do , " I called after him . We turned our attention back to the shapely , or I should say the chick-babe-mom , who was dolling up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepting a drink from a waiter in a white jacket . The waiter had carried the drink on a tray from the outdoor bar that 's under an overhang near the main clubhouse door . " How come I have n't seen her before ? " I asked . " Because she did n't come out till Bay Hill , " Jerry said . " You skipped Bay Hill and Doral , remember ? " " True , " I said . " I stayed home to do something . Oh , I know what it was . Get divorced . " Gazing at the chick-babe-mom on the veranda I was reminded of the time I was taken prisoner by another showstopper in a pair of low-riding jeans and skimpy top . Only she 'd been a blonde . But Alleene Simmons , my first wife , had n't dressed like that on purpose . It had been required of her by the low-rent owner of the **25;144;TOOLONG joint where she 'd been employed as the hostess when I met her . The bucktoothed owner , Bodobber Roberts , had long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hangout for gambling degenerates in those days . Guys in Fort Worth who 'd bet on everything from ice hockey to bugs crawling up a wall to how many weekend traffic fatalities there 'd be-city , county , state , nationwide . Alleene won my heart the minute I walked in . Not only with her looks but with the first thing she said to me . As she led me to a spot at the bar , I asked her what was good tonight , meaning what was good to eat . She said , " From everything I 've heard , it 's Oklahoma , give the six and a half . " Now at the magnolia joint , still looking at the babe , I said to my pals , " You know , your teen trash and your rock sluts flash skin like that , but a mature grownup woman ought to know better . I mean , she could have asked somebody how to dress when you go to the Masters . She must be dumber than dirt . " " Yeah , maybe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I recall , you do n't fuck the dumb . " Chapter Two This was the year the former Cheryl Haney sent me to Downtown Dump City . She joined my heavy-hitting ex-wife lineup as old number 3 , falling in there behind Alleene Simmons , old number 1 , and Terri Adams , old number 2 . I do believe Alleene is the only one of my wives I ever really liked . Cheryl kicked me out of the $950,000 house she 'd made me buy two blocks from the Colonial Country Club because she said that after three years of trying to make a marriage work with an asshole who did n't aspire to do anything with his life but hit a golf ball , it was n't worth the effort . I found out I 'd missed the cut in my own home the day I came back from a California tournament and found the note that said , " You-out ! And I 'm putting a sign in the yard that says ' No More Shit-Brains Need Apply for Husband Duties Here . ' Now , asshole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road . I do n't fuck for food anymore . " What happened was , Cheryl had turned about half socialite on me . She 'd decided I did n't measure up to the kind of husband she ought to be seen with . Her a successful businesswoman now who hobnobbed with other Fort Worth rich ladies who shopped in Dallas and supported the symphony and got their hair done all the time . Never mind that those rich ladies had once worked as law firm receptionists and department store salesgirls and had only become socialites because they married rich guys . I smooth-talked my way out of having to move immediately and our split was n't finalized until another social occasion . It was the night Cheryl dragged me downtown to the Bass Hall again to hear the Fort Worth Symphony play music for animals romping through the forest . Then afterward to the black-tie dinner party at the Fort Worth Club to discuss cellos with the city 's culture lovers . I was accused of humiliating and embarrassing her all evening by looking bored , yawning , and committing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much I was in awe of his ability to read music while he waved his stick in the air . I said I did n't see how anybody could read sheet music . Sheet music looked to me like my nine-iron and sand wedge trying to climb over fences . " You 're a disgusting fuckhead , " Cheryl said , pushing me into a corner out of everybody 's hearing . I countered by quoting from an old country song : " It was n't God who made honky-tonk angels . " " You shit-heap ! " she said viciously . " Good , " I said . " Fucks and shits . Now you sound like the chick I used to know ... the one who swam across the Trinity to get out of her old neighborhood and let me introduce her to a better way of life . " Which was a cruel thing to say . I did n't judge people by their neighborhoods . Well , some people , maybe . But Terri Adams , old number 2 , had come from the wealthiest side of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd sport-fucked every happy hour sumbitch in Tarrant County before she got around to me . Cheryl was like a lot of mercenary chicks in this world . Chicks who thought that because they were born good-looking , they deserved to be rich , it was what God intended , and they were determined to become rich , even if it meant marrying a pot-bellied , bald-headed A-rab . Cheryl took up golf , same as my other wives , although it was hardly because she liked the game as much as Alleene and Terri did . It was a social move , part of her plan . So , divot by divot , she golfed her way into the heart of every well-to-do male member at one of my country clubs , Mira Vista , which I came to learn was Spanish for Take Another Man 's Wife to Lunch . If I 'd been as smart as any of those Mozart cellos I would have seen what was happening . Seen Cheryl slipping back into the life she knew before me-that of breaking up homes for sport and pleasure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto a damage-proof wealthy gentleman who owned a yacht and knew where Sag Harbor was , she 'd fall deeply in love overnight and truly believe she 'd won the ball game . One of the last things she said to me was , " Just so there 's no mistake about it , I 'm keeping the house and the BMW . " " Naturally , " I said , faking nonchalance . " Trinity River deal . " I must have hit a bull's-eye . I heard a medley of fucks and shits as I took my leave . I was back living in a townhouse near the TCU campus . I was lonely , I confess-I 'd had some good times with Cheryl when she was n't giving me shit and spending with both hands-but I was happy to be unattached for the first time in a while . Which was evidently an attitude you could chalk up to being easily distracted by the Gwendolyn Pritchards of the world . ( Continues ... )               @ @ @ @ @ @
