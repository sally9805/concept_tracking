<p> You 're watching the " Friends " finale on TV when you remember that you 're waiting for an urgent e-mail . No need to get up . You set the TV to record , switch the screen to the Internet , and respond to your message . After watching the rest of " Friends , " you switch the screen back to your computer , where you 're organizing a slide show of pictures from your Alaska vacation last summer . You pipe in a little Jimmy Buffett cruising music from your CD collection , which you have stored on the PC . <p> That 's a taste of " convergence " or " the digital home , " buzzwords that stand for having a house full of digital devices that talk to one another and easily send video , audio , or other information wherever you want them . <p> It 's an enticing prospect . " We quickly get the idea of connectivity . It does n't take much selling , " says Brian Cooley , editor at large at CNET ( www.cnet.com ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " More people want the ability to have their content available anytime , anywhere , and on any device , " says Louis Burns , a vice president of Intel Corp. , the world 's largest computer chipmaker , which has a big stake in the success of " the digital home . " <p> " They want to wirelessly transfer M files from a PC in the den so they can listen to them on their stereo in the family room ; they want to view digital photos on their big-screen TV , or to watch video content on hand-held wireless devices . " <p> To see what the convergence buzz was all about , I took a test-drive of a Gateway Family Room Media Center or FMC 901 ( $ 999 ) , a PC that runs Microsoft 's Windows XP Media Center Edition operating system . ( The Yankee Group , which watches the home electronics industry , projects that 22 percent of PCs sold in the US in 2007 are going to be media center PCs . ) Gateway let me borrow one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a sleek metallic box with cool blue lights on its controls , meant to look like a VCR , DVD player , or stereo receiver , something that belongs in your living room or den . <p> It 's actually much more . It works happily with devices like digital cameras and M players , records TV shows onto its hard drive , plays or records DVDs , pulls music off the Internet ( a one-month free trial to Napster.com is included ) , and plays video games . Many functions are controlled with a TV-type remote . With its wireless keyboard and mouse , the FMC 901 is also a all-purpose PC , capable of working on word processing or surfing the Internet . <p> So , was it wonderful ? <p> Actually , it reminded me of Longfellow 's poem about the little girl with a curl on her forehead : " When she was good/ She was very , very good/ But when she was bad she was horrid . " Once the system was set up and operating , it was a lot of fun and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did something to throw it off or it mysteriously balked on its own . <p> CNET 's Cooley suggests that users ' experiences may be determined by the world from which they approach the project . People accustomed to working with PCs , he says , " expect to have to fiddle with a system to get it to work right . " But he concedes they are in the minority . Most people still expect to bring home a piece of consumer electronics , which this is trying to be , plug in a wire or two , and use it . <p> My experience was a lot more complicated than that . Let 's start with connecting the PC to the TV . <p> My decade-old 27-inch set does n't have any of the modern inputs on the back to make the connection . At the very least , an S-video line is needed . Rather than suggesting a way to work around the problem , Gateway came up with what it called a better idea : Why not sample our 30-inch wide-screen , flat-panel LCD TV ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can do ? <p> Two more large boxes containing the TV and its own remote speakers arrived . <p> Conclusion No. 1 : Adding a piece of electronics is like buying a new carpet . It 's not long before you realize the sofa , armchairs , and drapes now look drab . It 's called " obsolescence " : You 're in danger of discovering that your stereo and TV set are considered antiques . <p> Now I needed to bring the Internet into the system . My broadband connection was in an upstairs office , where we use our computer . My cable TV box was in the downstairs family room , where I wanted to install the FMC 901 . I needed to be connected to both to make it work . <p> Running a wire between the floors was possible but complicated and expensive ( if you hired an electrician ) . Hooking them up using a wireless router ( $ 149.98 ) was hip ( look Ma , no wires ! ) - and the wave of the future ( the Yankee Group estimates that by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It also meant that other devices in the house could tap in to the network , too , such as a notebook computer ( if I had one ) . <p> My brother-in-law Tim , a tech-savvy customer service manager for a computer company , had just set up a wireless network in his house and agreed to set up mine . <p> But what , in theory , should have taken only a few minutes took hours . The signal strength was low or nonexistent . He tried changing the channel the devices used to communicate . We moved the wireless antennas around the family room , searching for a decent signal . <p> Even after we got it working , it tended to cut out from time to time for still unknown reasons ( other wireless signals in the area , such as cordless phones , can sometimes be the culprit ) . <p> Conclusion No. 2 : For most people , setting up a PC-based media center is going to involve at least two projects : ( 1 ) setting up a wireless network in your home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its video source , such as a cable box . <p> As Tim continued to help me , seemingly little things became obstacles that took minutes or even hours to figure out . A picture finally emerged on the beautiful big screen ( note to readers : Remember to turn on the TV as well as the computer ) . Hurrah ! The FMC 901 was booting up . Double hurrahs ! But wait , where was the sound ? <p> Eventually , Tim figured out it had n't been turned on yet . Later , when we tried to upgrade from the S-video to a higher-resolution RGB computer monitor cable between the TV and computer , we lost the sound again . The audio had to be piped in a different way . Another cable . " Really annoying design , " Tim muttered . <p> In all , Tim spent close to eight hours helping me . But , being a computer guy , he was n't discouraged . <p> In fact , he 'd like to get a media center - after the price comes down . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TV and my TV , " he says . " I think there is some unwritten rule that you should spend at least as much on your TV as you do on the stuff to drive your TV . " <p> Nonetheless , he says , " I definitely think this is the way we are going to be doing things . Recording a movie on anything other than a hard drive is going to seem like horse-and-buggy days . You 'll only record to a DVD if you want to bring the movie with you . " <p> But what do you do if you want to set up a family media center and you 're not a computer whiz - or know one ? There 's a " whole burgeoning market right now for people who do high-tech handyman stuff , " Cooley says . In the fall , CNET will begin offering a list of what it 's calling " home integrators " who 'll come to your house , install your electronic devices , and make sure they talk to each other properly . <p> " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Cooley says . It 's a case of marrying the worlds of PCs and consumer electronics ( TVs , stereos ) , which " have different ethics , " he says . <p> The PC industry is all about the potential of new hardware to do new things . The consumer-electronics industry is much more conservative , he says . " They 're all about ease of use . " <p> Setting some industry standards will be a part of the solution , just as when automakers agreed that a car 's accelerator pedal is always under your right foot . Whoever can make these two worlds live together comfortably will win customers , he says . " Convenience always wins . " <p> Which means , according to some seers , eventually even the wireless mouse and remote control need to give way to some sort of voice-recognition system . ( Maybe we 'll give our media centers names : " Hal , record all coming episodes of ' The Apprentice . ' " Hal , show me my new e-mails . " ) <p> We are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are going to be a lot of fun , once a few more hassles are eliminated . <p> The digital revolution : Coming to a computer near you ? <p> Today 's PC and Internet users want to share media among their digital home devices , such as DVD and CD players , computers , TVs , and hand-held wireless devices . Here is what people say they 're looking for : <p> * 39 percent of PC households are interested in installing a home network in order to view photos on any TV or PC . <p> * 33 percent are interested in downloading movies and sharing them among the devices they own . <p> * 31 percent would like to download music and share it among devices . <p> * 28 percent are interested in sending video between devices in the home . <p> * 21 percent of US households want to use their PCs for digital video recording . <p> Market researchers have estimated that 35 million devices are currently connected in home entertainment networks . By the end of 2007 , it 's expected that 183 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a compound annual growth rate of 65 percent . <p> Sources : Intel , the Yankee Group , Park Associates , CED <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
