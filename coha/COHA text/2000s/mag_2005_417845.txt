American crocodiles are in critical condition . Dr. Frank Mazzotti is working to save them . // Most doctors today do not make house calls . But Frank Mazzotti is n't like most other doctors . Crocodiles can not come to him . Instead , he goes where they live . Mazzotti studies American crocodiles . They love wetlands . So Mazzotti spends much of his time in the Everglades . That 's an area in southern Florida . It is a mix of lakes , swamps , and saw grass prairies . Crocodiles are the largest reptiles in the world . A male American crocodile can grow to be 15 feet long and weigh 450 pounds . What does the largest reptile eat ? Just about anything it wants . Crocodiles usually eat fairly small animals . They feast on birds , fishes , and turtles , for example . Crocs have lousy table manners . They gobble their meals down whole . Sometimes crocs go after large animals , such as deer . In fact , they can snack on any animal that gets too close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rip big victims apart . Like most other reptiles , crocodiles hatch from eggs . A mother lays her eggs in a nest made of trash and plants . Sometimes she lays the eggs in sand . No other animals hunt or eat crocs . Yet American crocodiles are in trouble . Only 500 to 800 of them remain in the wild in Florida . The crocs that are still around face yet another problem . They do not grow as fast or live as long as they should . What 's happening to these reptiles ? Mazzotti and other scientists are working hard to find out . What they learn may help us take better care of American crocs . The River of Grass Mazzotti says his patient is not the only species in the Everglades that 's in trouble . At least 68 endangered or threatened species live there . They include bald eagles , crocodiles , Florida panthers , manatees , and wood storks . Not just plants and animals are in trouble . The Everglades itself is shrinking . To grasp why , it helps to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today , in fact , people sometimes call it the River of Grass . The river used to be 50 miles wide and at least six inches deep . Today it is only 40 miles wide and just a few inches deep . Spongy Land The River of Grass is shrinking because people moved to the area . Few of them wanted to live near or in a swamp . They wanted dry land ! So they built canals to control the water . Today about 1,700 miles of canals keep water from flowing through the Everglades . Instead the water flows into the ocean . As a result , about half the area has dried up . Drier land has brought more people to the Everglades . They are creating farms and towns . New towns are destroying places where many plants and animals live . " That 's one of the main threats to wildlife now , " says Mazzotti . " We took the land directly from them , and we 've messed up the rest . " In this race for space , animals are often the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only about 50 of these big cats are left . The problem is that panthers need a lot of room . A male can roam across 500 square miles in a single month ! Without enough space , panthers are dying out . Let It Flow Land is n't the only problem . Wildlife and people are also competing for water . People need water for drinking , cleaning , and growing crops . That does n't leave much for wildlife . But animals may soon get more water . Lawmakers have approved a plan that would destroy many of the old canals . That means more water would flow into the Everglades . Change is slow , however . It will take 20 or 30 years to fix the problems in the Everglades . How will people even know if the plan works ? The crocodiles will tell us , Mazzotti says . If life in the Everglades gets easier , crocodiles will start growing faster and living longer . Worldwise canal : artificial waterway reptile : cold-blooded animal that has scaly skin species : type of living thing wetland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nearly 400 bird species live in the Everglades . Populations are only a tenth of what they once were . Rare Sight . Florida panthers are hard to find these days . Fewer than a hundred of these endangered cats are still around . Sidebar Price of Progress . Building houses for people means less space for animals . // <p>
