That book in this month 's recommendations , Pioneers of Wonder , is a nice reminder of the days when most sf writers were well under the age of thirty . Here now is a story from a college undergraduate-Yoon Ha Lee reports that she just survived this semester 's finals at Cornell . ( It 's curious too to note that she 's our second contributor this month from Ithaca , New York . ) Hey first story for us was " The Hundredth Question " in our Feb. 1999 issue and we 're writing now to her professors to request that they give hey more time to write lyrical space adventures like this one . <p> THEY TESTED ME AGAIN and again to ensure that the implant had properly salvaged the functions of damaged tissues . " An experimental procedure , " a doctor said once , actually volunteering information . I had learned to hoard my questions . In return , they accepted it when I chose not to say if I felt any pain here , or here , or here ; if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or my past . They were right on one count . Red Knight , they called me , like a chess piece . I tried to tell them that there was no red knight in chess , that it could never be played . They never answered . Neither the doctors nor the technicians forbade me a mirror . I knew what I was to them : a ghost given shape in metal and flesh , given silver prostheses for mobility , salvaging the wreck of what had once been a man . And inside my skull , concealed from the mirror 's eye , was the implant to coordinate the prostheses and replace irreparable brain functions . At night , I lay still beneath the dimmed lights , though I rarely required sleep . During the quiet hours that even the doctors granted me , the memories surfaced , elusive and fleeting : a warm hand on my shoulder , a woman 's inquisitive eyes meeting mine over a game of chess , a friend 's favorite song that stayed in my head . " Echoes Down an Endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by an obscure Terran composer ; I recalled neither the friend 's name nor the composer 's . Spiraling notes over a harmonica 's plaint , theme and variations unfolding like lace . The song in my head always ended too soon . Somehow I expected it to go on and on forever : more echoes , more variations , until the original theme was scattered into oblivion . The woman came and went , a ghost dressed in black and gold and always standing aloof . She seemed another dream , given warmth and breath by the drugs that hazed my human senses or the diagnostics that shut down segments of my implant . Cryptic memories suggested I should know her : black swan to my red knight . The implant disagreed . One day I woke in new quarters , woke though I had not slept , and did not question the vanished time . The woman was here , too , her fingertips resting on a chessgrid beside the bed . Only then did I realize she was not , after all , a ghost born of drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by my lack of recognition , and gestured at the chessgrid . " For YOU . " I slid my silver-edged fingers over the chessgrid 's control panels and brought the pieces into holographic life . After a while I looked away from the black and white pieces to the woman . " Who are you ? " She expelled her breath . " I am Serhana Diestes . I came to see if you were all right . How would you like to be known ? " Like everyone else , she had trouble meeting my eyes when she spoke to me , but she did try . I shrugged , and knew from her expression that I had carried out the gesture too mechanically . " I have been called Red Knight . " If I had once owned a name , it was no longer relevant . Her mouth lifted a fraction , inexplicably . " Ah . " She smiled and searched my face , then nodded , tapping the chessgrid . " Something to pass the time , if the hours grow tedious . You were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no point in affirming something she knew and bent over the controls , invoking the grid 's processor and its network links as an opponent . After a moment I heard her retreating footsteps . All my ghosts were nameless , though I hoped for a name each time one haunted me . Alas , the woman sitting across from me was no exception . She smiled , and I wondered how she would regard me if she were real . Swan-shaped earrings swayed when she cocked her head . The ghost 's earrings woke muscles , or what passed for muscles : I was smiling . The chessgrid : Once upon a death , over several slow weeks , I had reprogrammed another chessgrid and edited the source files on the ship 's computer to expand the modes of play . Pawns became scoutships , knights became destroyers armed with cannon , bishops became fleet but flimsy starhikers . And so on . Red and black , blue and black , white and black , gold and black , the blazing colors of stars in the hungry night . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 . The first time we tried the expanded mode , she said to me , I like this variant , but it bothers me . Why ? I asked , awaiting her move . Her earrings swung briefly out of sight as she glanced at the modified grid . You might not want to now , but are you sure you can put the game back the way it was ? Backups . Reset the interface . Get another grid , I suppose . A sudden grin : Could you build one from scratch if you had to ? Whether or not I had taken her up on that gambit , I had forgotten . But , thinking of her gray eyes and her smile , I contemplated reprogramming this chessgrid , too . At least , trying to create an opponent for myself by drawing on links to computers more powerful than the local processor . Even now I found something darkly satisfying about chess , a bloodless war . After a time security came for me , six men and women in dark uniforms . One swallowed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough , and avoided my gaze thereafter . I followed unprotestingly through the corridors , whose harsh lighting and sterile air only emphasized their emptiness . My feet fell into the rhythm of the guards " steps . A door swished open before us and a guard motioned for me to enter , so I did . Inside , a tactical grid 's radiance washed the walls with color ; the lights overhead were pale and pitiless . Beside the grid sat Serhana Diestes . A weary smile crossed her face as she looked up at me . I took the other chair , across from her . " I assume I was brought here for a reason . " " Of course . " She swiveled in the chair to face me . " The doctors assure me that you 've recovered . is that right ? " " They would know . " " Medical opinions are n't everything . I was hoping you were feeling well enough to resume command . " Command : Ships arrayed in shifting patterns . Lasers searing across vacuum . Instrument readings molting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nothing at all . The cacophony of voices , the silent explosions hammering against tear-blurred eyes . Command : Rotating displays lit by clusters of pinprick color . Twicecondensed reports from distant fleets . Pattern matched against pattern , both against chaos . Hours studying avenues of attack , plotting and replotting strategy . " A war , " I said slowly . " You remember that much , then . " I caught the flicker of suppressed emotion at the edge of her voice and wondered what it meant . " Command of - ? " She smoothed her sleeves , meticulously adjusting the golden buttons . " Command of Rapallion 's navy . " Serhana tapped one of the control panels . " War . " I refused to be diverted by the grid just yet . " I have rank ? " Serhana laughed . " Yes ... Admiral Knight . " " Tell me what happened . I was injured in battle ? " " Yes . " " Unless I 'm mistaken , admirals do n't risk themselves on the front lines . " Serhana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do n't . But an attack came in the middle of an evacuation . You were almost killed . " I had no reason to disbelieve her . " Attacked by the Polity of Brechai . " Doors were opening in the halls of my memory , one by one , though more waited behind them . In answer , the woman flicked one of the tactical grid 's controls . " The war goes poorly , Admiral . " Another flick , and the panel before me blinked , passing access to me . I brought up enlargements , inspected them , dismissed them . " The war is nearly lost , you mean . " Her hands tightened on the table 's edge . " Are you well enough to resume command ? " " Who has been giving orders all this time ? " " Various admirals for various fronts , but what we need is a centralized command once more . The records are available through the networks . " " Very well . " I studied her and her insignia more closely : one more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I STARTED GIVING orders though I had yet to meet any of the soldiers under my command . Names on rosters , service records , profiles that dissected psyches for the discerning eye - these would suffice , I was told . The only record that puzzled me was my own , a list of scattered accomplishments revealing little of the man I had been . The premier and her staff took my military skill for granted . I could afford no such confidence . Loosing a ferret program to retrieve the lost , locked-away data - if it still existed - would not be difficult . Giving the ferret a safe den to return to with its find was another matter . I thought of the implant , knowing it sometimes drew on the networks " databases . But somewhere a blearyeyed technician must be monitoring the implant 's activity for medical or security reasons , more likely the latter . At several points I nearly gave up the endeavor , since it seemed an unnecessary use of time . Finally , for several nights , I tampered circumspectly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chessgrid . The ferret took shape , as lean and paranoid and keen-nosed as I could make it . All the while the implant believed I was amusing myself with the chessgrid , which was partly true . Then I freed the ferret and focused on the war . No one had exploited the subtler patterns in the Brechai 's blitzkrieg strategy while I was gone . I set about remedying this . I accessed data on their culture and leaders : a splinter group of humans nearly as fierce in peacetime as in war , intent on conquest , with military technology comparable to Rapallion 's . More reports alerted me to discontinuities between different styles of playing the game called War . Other news came in daily , of citizens hounded from their homes , ships left in blackened ruins for the void to swallow , blood and fire . Piece by piece , move by move , I worked on the task they had set me . Save this colony ; sacrifice that one . If I failed to drive back the Brechai , their advancing warfleets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives , against a nation ; soldiers " souls against civilians ' ; equations without simple solutions . The implant kept track of them all . After time and painstakingly calculated defeats , I found ways to turn losses into gambits , retreats into counterattacks , casualties into exchanges that left Rapallion a piece ahead . The rhythms of war returned to me readily enough . I went over the rosters , over ships " logs that the networks obligingly released to me . At first I discovered nothing new : Enemy sighted . Engagement . Call for reinforcements . New objectives . Distress call received . I almost lost myself in the litany of orders , similar to the ones I myself relayed to the commanders and captains , to the other admirals . Gradually , I came to hear the words that lay unspoken , stillborn beneath the weight of military protocol . I learned how , after one captain perished , the battleship Fist skewed further and further into recklessness until she flung herself at a Brechai dreadnought , and won . And died . How mutiny erupted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one home among many . How some squadrons fought harder and harder , blazing like blue stars as attrition tore them down , and others collapsed into ashes . Only a little longer , I wished to tell the countless souls who had yet to fall in battle , or who had fled inward from the war 's several fronts . only a little longer while the Brechai reluctantly stepped back from the territory they had taken and paused to regroup , yielding Rapallion the older borders . Only a little longer until Until what ? I had arranged all my pieces , my soldiers , around the simple necessity of defending Rapallion and her people . Limited resources with which to pursue a limited goal . But how many lives had I spent already ? Other questions exploded , unbidden , like neglected mines - slowly , slowly , at their own merciless tempo . Was I to continue throwing soldiers at the Brechai until they had no hope of another invasion for the next ten years ? Twenty ? Hundred ? Until they sued for peace ? Or until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question like the final , ghostly chord of the trio in my head : When is this war going to end ? The ferret was still searching , and I left it to continue its quest . I toyed with the chessgrid 's controls , trying to summon more memories . Suddenly it seemed important to name my ghosts . There had been a dark-haired woman with non-regulation , swanshaped earrings : Odette . One name . Her brother Tam , who loved music , anything from Swan Lake - he had given the earrings to Odette - to aleatory concertos . Chys Keivan , who never smiled , whom I had once seen crying . other ghosts , standing aloof in the corridors of my memory .. of a dead man 's memory . Do n't you ever tire of chess ? sallow-faced Chys had asked , peering over my shoulder . Try poker , said Tam , flipping an old-fashioned chip in the air . He and his friends were playing with an old-fashioned deck , too . I raised an eyebrow . I do n't trust your cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed back her hair . Another ghost : While passing me in the mess hall , an officer had grabbed my arm . I heard you turned down another one . I shook my arm free , then stopped when I saw his face . If only we could harness gossip for intelligence , we 'd have an invincible fleet . You 're changing the subject . So I am . You 're out of line , soldier . The officer swallowed , saluted , and moved on . Only then did I regret MY words . Even now , ignorant of the incident 's cause , I found I regretted those words . More ghosts : But the ambush Wo n't be there , I had snapped , forcing the woman to look at me . If your ship leaves cover a second too soon , I wo n't need to fry you . The Brechai will do it for me . Understood ? Odette said without interrupting her system checks , How do you know that they have n't another reserve , sir ? No teasing , no camaraderie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected . Good point . Because - and I had the computer dump several scenarios to her station . They wo n't take the optimal deployment since it 's too obvious , we 're prepared for it , and it depends overmuch on individual initiative . A final ghost , nearer to me than the rest : The airlock had been only an arm 's length away , and I stared at it until my vision blurred . Stars waited outside , and icy vacuum , and the drifting remains of soldiers who had trusted me . I had , in my turn , trusted the orders given to me : a mistake . I should have looked out better for my men . The metal barrier shone blade-like , granting me my reflection . Wait for me , I said to the stars , and moved away . Someday my turn would arrive . Here in the present , alone with the chessgrid , I listened to the guards pacing outside my quarters . I had been a squadron commander ; that much was clear . I had not given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brechai directly . Serhana Diestes had spoken of an evacuation , an unexpected attack . I was beginning to doubt her . Some things came to me more slowly than they had , despite the computer in my head . Or perhaps because of it . I had learned to bow to the premier , and so I did when she entered . She , in turn , smiled and offered her hand to me . I declined the hand , looking away from the tactical grid and its drifting patterns . " A point of information , madam . " Serhana 's eyes were watchful . " Yes , Admiral ? " " Rapallion is out of imminent danger , " I said , thanking the doctors and technicians that my voice carried few inflections . " I thought it wise to reexamine the war 's objectives on our end , for the sake of planning strategy . " She nodded briskly - too briskly , after a delay . " That 's understandable . If I may - ? " I watched while she gave the grid her own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a map of bold colors against black , uncluttered by deployments and deaths . Gold for Rapallion and blue for Brechai , subtler shades of yellow and cyan for past gains or losses . " And ? " I asked . " We must be certain we 'll never be overrun again , " Serhana said . Her stiffness dropped away as fever swept through her words and she forgot who I was , what I was . " Vigilance is n't enough . Once this war ends , we have to make sure the Brechai wo n't attack us again . Secure our interests and cut away their resources . What weakens them can only strengthen Us . " Unless it weakens us too , I did not say . " The borders can be secured further . Are you suggesting a counterstrike at their heart ? " Her laugh came high and strained . " I 'm no military mind , Admiral . Yes . Yes . Do what it takes . " Unease blossomed within the parts of me that still understood unease . The premier 's career @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ border settlement that was ceded to the Brechai after a " diplomatic incident , " at a time when Rapallion bitterly acknowledged that war would ruin her . Later , Serhana Diestes surfaced in politics , appealing to those who wearied of appeasing the Brechai , of peace at any price , and now she sat before me . I imagined the girl she had been , buried beneath the years . Quietly , I said , " What of diplomacy ? " " Diplomacy lost us key industrial sectors , " she snapped . " Diplomacy taught Brechai that Rapallion would cower and let a foreign power trample her . If we hold back now , Brechai will only try again later , generations down the road . " She fidgeted with her sleeves ; the gold trim and buttons glittered sullenly . " In any case , you need n't concern yourself with foreign policy . Too late : she had already stalked out . Her footfalls joined those of the guards , then faded away . A routine checkup , they called it when the doctors and technicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protest , but said nothing : better to play along . I could n't dismiss the possibility , though , that some subtler function of the implant was influencing my reasoning . I let them drug me and dim my senses while they discussed operational parameters , and woke hours later by the count of the clock inside me . What they had taken from me , I had no way to determine . There were blurred spaces in my memory , but then , there had always been blurred spaces . " Take it easy for a day or two , " a technician said to me in a low voice before leaving . I studied the chessgrid . If only all wars were bloodless , the thought came unbidden . But I was and had been a soldier , and soldiers learned to kill . To protect . I had a responsibility to Rapallion 's fleet , Rapallion 's people . I wanted to laugh , could n't . I had sacrificed so many to defend the nation , and the implant listed them all more quickly than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why sacrifice yet more ? There had to be a better way . I closed my eyes . What had Serhana told me an eternity ago ? Unless I 'm mistaken , admirals do n't risk themselves on the front lines , I had said . They do n't . But an attack came in the middle of an evacuation . You were almost killed . She had n't lied , but played on unspoken assumptions : an elegantly constructed deceit . There had been an evacuation , and I had nearly died .... Evening , we had called it , though it followed neither station 's time nor ship 's time . Chys Keivan , dour as ever , remarked that each one must correspond to a timelocked evening somewhere in Rapallion . Poor Chys , who always looked as if he would rather sit in a comer scribbling equations instead of exchanging obscene jokes or playing games - yet he never failed to come . Evening . When we all gathered like a motley family around our ships , technically to recheck maintenance , but we always got that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bureaucrats . We were n't the only squadron , either . I hear this sector 's going critical in a matter of days , said Ivan Margraise . He was busy stroking Tam 's hair - no use getting either of those two to stand watch in case some martinet stopped by - but everyone knew the remark had been addressed to me . Scuttlebutt gets to you before it tags me , Ivan , I replied . I do n't know any more of this than you do . No , no , the trick to hacking into - Evhana , prompted either by the sudden hush or by Chys 's glower , blushed and shut up . I drew a deep breath , propping my elbow against my ship 's strut . Whole damn war 's going critical , unless the government 's holding a secret weapon - someone snorted - in reserve . Now leave me alone , okay ? An earring 's glitter caught my eye . You 're being unfair , said Odette Viantin . We 're worried . Are n't you ? well Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's human after all ! And winced when Ivan elbowed him . Scuttlebutt had been too optimistic , for once : the sector had already gone critical . If I had known more I would have been able to warn those around me , but it was too late . Matters had already been decided at the upper echelons . Alarms tore into our old routines ; spindles of fire splintered our lives . Under my leadership , a covey of squadrons covered the retreat , and yet the Brechai swarmed forth . In the strident accelerando of combat , I had found but a single way to minimize losses . Memories , memories , memories , returning despite the whisper in my head that insisted I had more pressing concerns . Hands that had cradled a woman 's fingers , sweated , tightened in pain or fury or desire . Eyes too empty for tears . Ignoring orders to turn tail so more people could pay for my survival with their own charred bones . Though I had rejected post after post , promotion after promotion , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few who retained a lower rank rather than letting their promises of glory and power seduce me . Even after they saw me send my friends to die that others might live , even after they saw that a tactical genius can lose , they wanted me . Chys Keivan , one of the few survivors of the First Massacre , where the Brechai struck without warning . Ivan Margraise , who loved wit and poetry . Odette and Tam Viantin , sister and brother . Evhana Marchiond , once a programmer . And all the others I had disciplined , smiled at in passing , beaten at chess . Serhana had n't lied . Admirals do n't risk themselves on the front lines , and I had not been an admiral during the evacuation , only after . An experimental procedure , the doctor had told me . How many times had they run this experiment ? ONCE BEFORE had I attempted this exercise , on a smaller scale : I had played to lose , and lost to Odette . This time I had no margin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Brechai . A trio . Pain and revenge were hard masters to give up , it seemed . I knew no other reason that either nation would continue war past the obvious objectives of territorial expansion or self-defense and into the cinders of ruin . I wished I could tell them otherwise , but the only voice I had was the voice of war , and their voices in reply told me they were unready to listen . Discontinuities shifted as the Brechai , hampered by using a patchwork of officers in lieu of a centralized command in the vastness of space , strove to make sense of my strategy . I parried their probing attacks , seeking to discourage , not cripple . A way of warning them , I can destroy you , if any of the Brechai strategists appreciated the deeper nuances of war . A way of asking those involved to find another way to resolve the conflict . More dangerous was the premier , whose voice grew more cold and cutting each time we met . Sometimes , when the human part of me grew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of my ghosts . Then I recognized her black-and-gold garb or her piercing eyes , and the ghosts fled . There would come a point when Rapallion , now the aggressor , could choose to destroy lives for the sake of conquest or surrender that dream for the sake of her citizens . I had engineered the war in this direction and its consequences shifted accordingly . Yet I thought of Odette and Tam , Ivan and Chys and Evhana , the millions of soldiers like them - if they had lived and were serving in some squadron among the many I commanded now , however distantly , would I give the same orders ? Who are you betraying ? I asked myself as the war 's trajectory veered toward a draw . Whether I was right or not remained to be seen . The ferret had scurried to its home after scouring the computers , and now waited for me to inspect its catch . I erased the program and tinkered with the chessgrid until it displayed the patchwork data . As I scanned the display , the implant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wondered if another " routine " checkup had just been scheduled . Still I lingered , like an orchestra spellbound by a fermata , on the chessgrid 's staticky visuals . Here he was , dark-haired and hazel-eyed : Christophe Deianda , the man I had once been . The record included the standard voice clip , in which he recited his name , rank , and so on , but the chessgrid had no playback capability . I pulled out the audio data , reconstructed it , and heard in my head a sharp , almost sarcastic voice . The psychological profile revealed latent emotional instability , an unusual capacity for creating synergy , loyalty - to his soldiers and not the government , I knew . What would Chys have said if he met me now ? Would Ivan and Tam have turned away at my approach ? Would Odette have flinched from my metal touch on her warm skin ? What had I become ? Flesh bleeds . Metal can not . Red Knight , red blood , red rust . Killed in action , claimed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I deleted the stolen data . For his sake - for all the soldiers " sakes -I would keep trying to wrest control of the war from Rapallion and Brechai , and bring this trio to a close . " You 're stalling . " Without moving away from the tactical grid , I said , " Beg pardon , madam ? " " I 'm not a fool , Admiral . " Serhana exhaled slowly . " It 's a miracle you 've wrought . Why throw it away ? " I listened to her footfalls , the sweep of her long hair , the whisper of black and gold clothing . It dismayed me that I could call these to mind more clearly than Chys 's flickering scowl or Evhana 's sly , trilling laugh ; Ivan 's deceptively mild eyes and Tam 's absentminded humming , Odette 's shy touch and Christophe 's sharp , impassioned voice . " I asked you earlier about diplomacy , madam . Surely the Brechai are willing to negotiate by now . " The premier stood in front of me now , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You think they can be trusted . " I let my hands lie still . " That 's an evasion , madam . Trusted ? I would n't know . But they are reaching a point where they have few options , and their leaders are not ones , I hope , to glory in mass suicide . " She stiffened . " is it impossible to subdue the Brechai for once and for all ? " " No , " I answered , " but at this point the losses would be unspeakable . You will have made life .. safer .. for future generations of Rapal , but those generations will be few and scattered . Look - " I manipulated the controls , changing the grid 's display to a mosaic of livid red against black . " Casualties , madam . Ours and theirs . " I thought I heard her mutter - scarcely a mutter , at that - " Not again . " Then she said , " It is war . I know the numbers . " Do you ? I wondered , reviewing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight for his land . Better that than surrender . " " A soldier 's duty , perhaps , " I murmured , " but what of those who send soldiers to die ? " More than ever , I became aware of the guards pacing the corridor outside , and plotted their paths in my head . " Have you ever been a soldier , madam ? " She had no answer . " I ask you again : is there no other way ? " I had left the premier a way out , not only for herself , but for Rapallion , since the Brechai were no longer a threat . She sucked in her breath . " Necessity - " I looked up at her resolute , sleepless face . " Necessity , " I repeated in a voice that was calm because it could not be otherwise . " War is n't chess . You sacrifice lives , not pieces . " Her eyes upon mine were cold and certain . " If you allow us to be defeated , more lives will be lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and you know it . " " There is little possibility of defeat at this point . " I met her gaze . " I remember , now , why I became a squadron commander - and stayed one . I was n't risking anonymous units ; I was risking myself and my friends . " The word almost caught in my throat . " Every time gave an order in battle I had to remember that a miscalculation on my part might result in their deaths . " They threatened to promote me again and again , put more soldiers under my control . I threatened to desert , turn traitor , kill myself anything to make them leave me alone . They had enough power-hungry officers . They never understood that the last thing I wanted was to become another one " playing games . " " Christophe Deianda 's mouth would have twisted . I could only press my fists together . " I almost lost contact with the people I was ordering around . Damned if I 'll let it happen again . Let me go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be a better way to settle this . I may not be completely human " - the premier flinched - " but I can at least try to treat soldiers as human ... the Brechai as human . " Serhana crossed her arms . " Do you think it 's that simple ? " She touched one of the gold buttons on her black sleeve . The door hissed open . " In the long run , you would destroy Rapallion . " " Destroying it is simple , " I said . " Preserving a nation is another matter entirely . " The guards had entered and surrounded me , six men and women in dark uniforms , with uniformly dark expressions . We are following orders , the six uneasy faces told me . Do not resist . I already have , I thought , wondering if I had done enough - dared enough . Serhana had turned her back to me . I bowed my head and stood , allowing the guards to escort me from the room : mate in two moves . I knew when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had defied his orders and headed back into the inferno to which he had fed his friends " lives . In the darkness I remembered an admiral who had sought again and again to salvage a war he had sabotaged again and again . In the darkness I sought to save my memories , even knowing I would fail , or worse , that I would soon cease to care .... It had promised to be a thankfully uneventful evening portside : time to relax , whatever form that relaxation might take , or time to think . I was playing solitaire chess when a hand waved in front of my eyes . Go away , Ivan , I said without looking up . If you 're a solipsist you can pretend I do n't exist , he said helpfully . I 'm not . Then you have a problem , do n't you ? I sighed , grasped his hand , and moved it out of the way - and caught sight of the newcomer hovering behind him , looking wistfully at my chessgrid . I recognized her bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry , I said to her . I 'm off-duty , too , she replied , grinning . Or shall I say , I 'm off-duty , sir ? She tapped the table . Tam told me you were looking for a chess partner . Want to give it a try ? Odette ! Tam had come up beside her and was shaking his head . Pardon my sister . Your sister ? I repeated brilliantly . She laughed and patted Tam 's shoulder . To his everlasting regret . Start over , Ivan advised me . He glanced at the woman and added , Do n't mind Sir here . He 's always in a foul mood when he 's thinking ot ways to trample tyrants , outwit evil overlords , and save Civilization As We Know It . She laughed again . I 'm Odette Viantin . As you know by now .. sir . Her hand stole toward the chessgrid , then drew back . I nodded to her and she reinitialized the game . You 're right - we 're off-duty and I sha n't quibble about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a lovely name . - White or black ? From the comer one of the poker enthusiasts said , What , Deianda 's falling for the dame ? Odette grinned at me . I raised my eyebrows at her , which prompted a round of jokes and innuendo that I affected not to hear . Across the room , I saw that Evhana 's ears were burning even as she contributed , and I chuckled . Ill take white , if you please , said Odette , touching one of her earrings . And it 's not much of a name , really . She opened with a Guinevere gambit . It 's from a ballet , Tam told me . The white swan princess . Cheer up , sis , it could 've been Odile . He misinterpreted my blank expression what was ballet ? - and said , The black swan . I gave Odette the standard response and waited . The white swan dies at the end , she said to her brother while squinting at the pieces . The story does n't say what happens to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white swan does n't . She gave me a rueful smile . Sorry . Tam and I have had this argument on and off through the years . She opened an arc of attack for one of her bishops . Maybe this time the white swan will live instead , I said , resolving to look up the story someday . Maybe . Her earrings danced . Your move ? We played on while Tam rambled about the history of Swan Lake productions . Odette and I , it turned out , were so closely matched that it hurt when I ended the duel by making the proverbial second-to-last mistake . I lost that game but gained a friend : an exchange well-made . ... And out of the darkness it ceased to matter , as did the hours at the tactical grid hounding the Brechai into destruction , the crescendo of casualty lists , the whispers of Red Knight .
