Photograph // Thanksgiving Day 's crowning glory is turkey and those special family side dishes . The meal only comes out perfect , however , if you do a little advance strategizing . Once you 've decided on your menu , think through how to cook it . If all of your dishes have to go in the oven-and at different temperatures and times-you might have trouble . Modify your menu so that you get the turkey done first ; then choreograph the rest of your prep time so that all your dishes come out together . The tips we offer will help you develop a plan , whether you 're working with new recipes such as the ones here or trusted favorites . Turkey Tricks It can take two to three days to thaw a frozen turkey . So , buy it ahead of time while the selection is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Find defrosting charts attached to the turkey , or visit www.butterball.com . After the turkey thaws , stick your hand into the cavity and pull out the neck and giblets . They 're usually wrapped in paper . If you forget this step and find these after you 've finished cooking , your turkey is still safe to eat ; just pull ' em out , enjoy a laugh , and go on . Once you remove the turkey from the oven , cover it loosely with foil to allow the bird to rest . The juices absorb back into the turkey , and it carves easily . This resting ? prime oven time for additional casseroles or dessert . For an easy roast turkey , see page 90 . Photograph // The Roasting Pan A turkey is best cooked on a rack in a shallow roasting pan . If your roasting pan is missing the rack , line the bottom with 1 inches of roughly chopped fruits and vegetables ( onions , celery , carrots , apples ) . These elevate the bird off the pan and add @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a delicious gravy . Here are some things to keep in mind when it comes to picking roasting pans . * For ease of cleanup , choose a large aluminum foil disposable pan , available at the supermarket . You may need to place it on a baking sheet for support . * Avoid deep Dutch ovens with high sides ( more than 4 inches ) , and do n't use a lid ; you 'll get a steamed turkey rather than a browned roasted one . * A good roasting pan costs from $45 to $60 . We like a stainless exterior with a dark nonstick interior and sturdy handles . In the Oven The turkey 's done . Decide whether you can fit one or two baking dishes into your oven , and position the racks accordingly . For older ovens , allow extra baking time if the oven contains more than one item . You may also need to rotate the dishes halfway through the bake time for even baking and browning . For newer ovens , the technology allows them a standard baking time , regardless of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ baked at the same time if they require the same baking temperature . When you 're selecting your menu , keep an eye on temperatures and bake times to make coordination easy . What About Convection Cooking ? Convection ovens force hot air around food and cook it about 25% faster than conventional ovens . You save time and energy with this method , and there 's the added bonus that food loses less moisture and retains most of its nutrients . Several companies combine convection and conventional options in the same oven . That 's a great choice regardless of the size of your household . No special equipment is required but it helps to know which pans work best . For best results with convection cooking , keep these tips in mind . * Use shallow , uncovered casserole dishes ( no more than 2 inches deep ) . * Use baking pans with sides no higher than an inch or so , such as cookie sheets and jelly-roll pans . * Deep roasting pans , oven roasting bags , and covered casserole dishes keep the heat from circulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Aluminum foil tents will blow off a dish from the force of circulating air . Switch to the conventional cooking method when you 're using either of these . Most manufacturers suggest one of the following options for converting cooking times and temperatures for a convection oven . * Bake at the same temperature , but for less time . * Reduce the temperature by 25 , and then bake at the same time the recipe calls for . * Bake for a little less time , and reduce the oven temperature . After you bake the first cake or cornbread and roast a chicken and vegetables , you 'll know exactly what adjustments work best with your oven . The main thing is to explore and enjoy the options . Oven Alternatives If your oven ca n't accommodate everything on your menu , consider replacing some recipes with ones that rely on a slow cooker , microwave , or cooktop . Steam vegetables or cook potatoes in the microwave , or saut fresh vegetables on the cooktop . You can also microwave hard squashes such as acorns and butternut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make sure they fit your microwave ) , and reheat them just prior to serving . When using the slow cooker , set it on a cutting board to protect your countertop from heat fluctuations that might cause it to crack . Also , make cleanup easy with new slow-cooker liners ( like a plastic bag inside your slow cooker ) available at the supermarket . Just lift the bag out of the slow cooker after the food is removed , and toss it . For smart slow-cooker recipes , see our Slow-Cooker Cornbread Dressing on page 170 , or check out how we use the slow cooker to hold mashed sweet potatoes until it 's time to eat . About Desserts Good cooks take several approaches . The first is to offer selections that can be made ahead of time , such as cakes , some pies , and chilled desserts . Other dessert items , such as cobblers and bread puddings , go into the oven just before you sit down to eat and come out hot just as you finish the meal . Either approach works .
