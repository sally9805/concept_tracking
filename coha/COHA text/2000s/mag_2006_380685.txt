While Pope Benedict XVI is busy filling the shoes of John Paul II , a quiet American is trying to do the same in Benedict 's old job . So how 's it going for William J. Levada , former Archbishop of San Francisco , whom Benedict tapped to head the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith ? " I 'm past the deer-in-the-headlights phase , " he told TIME last week in his first interview since he took office in August . <P> Good thing . The most influential U.S. prelate in Roman Catholic history , Levada is tasked with maintaining doctrine and discipline among the 1.1 billion faithful at a time when several issues threaten to divide the flock . In November the church issued a controversial Instruction on gay seminarians . To Levada , " the document is very clear . A person with deep-seated homosexual tendencies is not suited for the priesthood . " Another tricky topic : Should politicians be denied Communion if they espouse policies that contradict church teaching ? Levada would like to see that debated more but says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have to accept as part of Jesus ' gospel , " such as opposition to abortion . " Catholic politicians need to take this seriously , " he says . " Maybe they need to say , ' I 'm not able to practice my faith and be a public representative . ' " <P> A more immediate concern is the ceremony this week at which Levada and 14 other prelates will be elevated to Cardinal by the Pope . Asked how he might feel when he gets the red hat signifying that high office , Levada admits a purely sartorial worry . " Of course , " he says , " you want to make sure you have your hat on straight . "
