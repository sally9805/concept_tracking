It 's that time again . Time to turn dreams into action . Time to gear up for another memorable season on the water . You want your boat to run well and to be trouble-free . You want to go where you want and do what you want without having to worry about mechanical failures  --  and this is the time to make a concerted effort to prevent their occurrence . The extra hours that it takes to methodically inspect vital systems and to make repairs where necessary will save time spent broken down at the dock or in a boatyard . As in so many of life 's endeavors , preparation is the key to success . Do n't neglect the details . A loose connection or fastener can often lead to a major calamity . A weekend of prevention can be worth weeks of carefree cruising . And in the fall , you can pat yourself on the back . 1 Make the boat watertight . Of all the steps you take to make your boat shipshape for the coming season , the most important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begin with the most basic preventive maintenance in all of boating : keeping your boat afloat  --  which means keeping water outside , rather than inside , your hull . There are only a couple of ways that water can enter a boat . The first is through a hole or a crack in the hull . If you 've kept your boat in the water over the winter , you should be cognizant of any water intrusion . If the bilge pump has been working overtime , there 's a reason . ( A bilge pump cycle counter is a useful means of monitoring activity . Frequent pumping can result from especially rainy weather , or it can be caused by a leak . ) If your boat has been out of the water over the winter , take time to carefully inspect the hull before dropping it back in . While looking for cracks , also check for blisters . ( Not good . ) Of course , you should have new bottom paint for the coming months , or the ablative paint from last season should still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can enter and sink a boat are exhausts and through-hull fittings . An inspection of the exhaust system is sufficient to be confident that everything 's as it should be , especially if you 've never had any problems in this area . As for through-hulls , they require some attention . Before launching , inspect any and all through-hulls from the outside . Screens and grills should be free of any foreign matter , and there should n't be anything clogging the fittings . Inspect the outlets above the waterline as well as the inlets below it . Every through-hull should have a sea cock ( one with a lever that swings up and down rather than a handle that turns ) that allows water to enter ( or exit ) and also securely keeps it from entering . Spring inspection entails making sure that the sea cocks are open , which means they are set to allow water to enter . It also includes a hands-on test to confirm that every sea cock works easily and is tightly seated . Faulty sea cocks should be replaced before launching . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood plug in proximity to a sea cock is a wise safety measure . Water enters the boat through sea cocks and then takes various circuitous routes to pumps , engines , air conditioners , baitwells , washdowns , water heaters , etc . Every inch of these routes should be checked for possible or potential leaks . Hoses should be in good condition , and hose clamps should be tight and in good working order . This includes outlet lines as well as inlet hoses and pipes . Double , stainless steel , round-edged clamps are best . Your last line of defense against unwanted water intrusion is your bilge pump . Test it to make sure that it works in both manual and automatic modes . Connections should be tight , and any wire splices in the bilge ( it 's best not to have any ) should be watertight . Two bilge pumps are better than one . You can install the float switch of a second pump higher than that of the first so that it functions as a backup . A high-water alarm is also something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition and through-hulls , running gear should also be looked over and maintained before launching . Shafts and rudders should be secure and straight . Cutlass bearings should be sound ( check shaft for play ) . Running gear should be free of barnacles or any other growth . This goes for trim tabs as well . If the tabs have paint flaking off of them , or if the rudders do , some scraping , priming and re-coating is in order . Test trim tabs before launching so that necessary repairs can be made with the boat out of the water . Check the prop(s) for bent or dinged edges . If you experienced any vibration last season , your prop may be out of balance . Minor imperfections can be filed smooth , but more serious damage demands professional attention . When putting props on shafts , remember to grease the shaft . And remember the keyway , if there is one , and the cotter pin . Outboards should have fresh gear oil . Four-strokes should have fresh lube oil . Start the season with a new set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fittings , top off fluid if necessary and grease rams . Check that fishing line is n't wound around outdrive seals . Finally , check all underwater sacrificial zincs . It 's a good idea to start the season with fresh ones or ones that are almost new . 3 Get Connected . Even small boats with a minimum of gear and amenities have an astonishing amount of electrical wiring hidden beneath their smooth surfaces . Open a boat 's dashboard access panel and you 'll understand why electrical problems top the list of common onboard breakdowns . Making sense and creating order of the confusing nest of colorful wiring will go a long way toward preventing problems and making them easier to solve . At the very least , you should inspect all electrical connections and check that they 're tight and free of corrosion . Start with the battery . Its posts should be shiny . You can clean them up with emory cloth or regular sandpaper . Cable ends should also be free of corrosion for a tight connection . Anti-corrosion grease will help keep the juice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cells should be topped-off with distilled water . Next stop is the battery switch , whose terminals should also be free of corrosion . Make all electrical inspections with a can of spray-lube in your hand , and do n't be afraid to use it . Follow wiring back to bus bars , terminal strips , fuses ( make sure you have extras ) , circuit breakers ( which should be labeled ) and electrical equipment and appliances . Once again , check for tight connections and look for corrosion . A shot of moisture-displacing lube for use on electronics will retard future corrosion . Spray away , but when doing so make sure all electrical power is turned off ( some spray lubes are flammable in the air ) . When inspecting all of these connections , also eyeball the wires themselves . Look for nicks in the insulation . Wires should be well supported , neatly bundled and protected from chafing where they go through bulkheads , panels , etc. ( use grommets or protective collars ) . Check power and antenna plugs for all electronics . Test electronics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulbs . 4 Power up . Before enlisting your engine for another season 's service , check all of its external systems to make sure they 're in good shape . Fuel lines are one of the most important areas to inspect because of safety . Go over the entire fuel system , including fittings and hoses . Do n't forget fill and vent hoses . All hoses should be firm yet supple  --  not soft or brittle . Do n't forget the hose clamps . New fuel filter elements may be needed . Fuel/water separators should be clean and ready to go . You should also look for possible leaks around tanks , pumps and fittings . On sterndrives , inspect the rubber bellows for cracks and aging , especially in the folds . On all engines , inspect the condition of all belts and make sure that they 're properly tensioned . Replace any that are worn . Lubricate moving parts , such as throttle and gearcase control cable linkage . Engine drain plugs and engine zincs should be removed and replaced . Use new zincs if necessary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fuel lines should also be carefully checked . It 's a good idea to consider the condition of all cooling system impellers . Impellers can take on a " set " during hibernation . This can be just as damaging as imperfections caused by usage . If impellers have n't been changed for a year or two , this is the time to do it . Finally , make sure that all fluids are topped off , including oil , coolant and hydraulic fluid . You should also check the steering system . 5 Tight makes right . You 'll need a socket set , some screwdrivers and enough free time to work your way from stem to stern . The objective is to make sure that everything that 's fastened to your boat remains that way . Just envision having your boat become untied because the screws or bolts that secure an onboard cleat have worked loose ; or someone falling overboard because of a poorly secured stanchion . Simply check all fasteners for tightness . If they 're corroded or frozen , remove and replace them . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will impede future corrosion . Include ground tackle on your list , along with brackets for antennas and electronics , railings and all deck hardware . 6 Sweat the small stuff . Having done all of the above , you can now turn your attention to the myriad details that remain  --  so many that there 's only room here to mention some of them . First , here 's a list of items that should be in good condition and/or working well at the start of the season : dock and anchor lines ; toilets ; MSDs and holding tanks ; fire-extinguishing systems ; appliances ; locks ; snaps and zippers ; stuffing box ; sump pump ; windlass ; compass ; control cables ; alarms ; horn ; blowers ; thermostat ; air conditioner ; cushions ; shore cords ; lift rams ; life raft ; PFDs ; wipers ; dinghy ; gauges . Here 's a list of other chores and projects to consider during spring commissioning : Clean and polish or wax fiberglass gel coat and metal hardware ; inspect and service your trailer ; label all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fenders and shore cords ; re-bed deck hardware where bedding is cracked ; caulk around windows and doors ; varnish brightwork ; rejuvenate teak ; touch up paint , including the boat 's bootstripe . Finally , you should be sure to replenish all of the essential supplies for the cruising season ahead , including spare parts ( hoses , belts , impellers , fuses , bulbs , filters , etc. ) fluids , charts and first aid items . And make sure you have at least the basic tools stored aboard to make minor repairs and to service your boat . Search for Boatkeeper tips by topic at www.motorboating.com <p>
