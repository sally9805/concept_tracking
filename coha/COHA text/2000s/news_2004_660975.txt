<p> In January 2000 , US intelligence tracked two suspected Islamic terrorists , Khalid al-Midhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi , to a terror summit of sorts in Kuala Lumpur , Malaysia . Agents knew that at least one of the men - Hazmi - had a visa that would allow him to enter the US . <p> Unsurprisingly , the CIA wanted both of them followed after they left the meeting and traveled to their next stop , Bangkok . <p> But the alert to Bangkok agents arrived too late , and the suspects disappeared into the teeming city . Days later the pair flew out unimpeded for Los Angeles . They lived quietly in southern California for more than a year , preparing for an upcoming role : hijackers in the Sept. 11 plot . <p> Would the worst terror attacks in the nation 's history have been prevented if Messrs . Midhar and Hazmi had n't slipped away in Bangkok ? Maybe not . But in hindsight that moment in early 2000 , and three others in the summer of 2001 when investigators came close to nailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closest US intelligence ever came to disrupting Al Qaeda 's impending US hits . <p> Such haunting " what-ifs " have n't necessarily been the focus of the Sept. 11 commission 's work . The public hearings that have riveted Washington in recent weeks have instead been aimed at identifying systemic faults in the nation 's intelligence apparatus . Commission members are likely to recommend soon some kind of sweeping bureaucratic change - possibly the establishment of a cabinet-level intelligence czar . <p> But from staff reports and bits of testimony it is possible to piece together a vivid picture of the pre-9/11 struggles of front-line agents against an enemy they only dimly understood . That struggle failed . But seeing how close agents came to thwarting the plot , it is possible to believe that victory is achievable - that another attack is not somehow fated to succeed . <p> " It is important that the 9/11 commission provide as complete a document as possible , " says Jim Walsh , a security expert at Harvard University 's Kennedy School of Government . " These are the only people in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the documents and hear all the people testify firsthand . " <p> Besides the missteps at the time of the Kuala Lumpur meetings , agents came close to cracking the case three additional times in 2001 . After the October 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in Yemen , in which 17 US service members lost their lives , FBI investigators worked with Yemeni officials to identify the culprits . <p> The mysterious ' Khallads ' <p> One of the conspirators of the Cole attack told an FBI investigator in January 2001 that his boss was " Khallad . " That name , which means silver in Arabic , was familiar to the FBI investigator . He 'd heard about Khallad from another source , who had told both the FBI and CIA that Khallad was close to Osama bin Laden . Khallad 's name had also come up during the investigation into the 1998 bombings of the two US embassies in Africa . <p> The FBI investigator obtained a photograph of the boss and forwarded it to the FBI/CIA joint source , who confirmed that it was indeed Khallad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of this information flowed into the CIA 's bin Laden unit in the Counterterrorist Center , its officers began to wonder if Khallad was n't the same person as Khalid al-Midhar , the possible Al Qaeda operative identified at the 2000 meeting in Kuala Lumpur . <p> They sent surveillance photos of that January meeting to the same joint source . The source was not able to identify Mr. Midhar , but said he was 90 percent certain the other person in the photos was Khallad bin Attash . <p> The CIA officers by now realized that Khallad and Midhar were not only different people , but that this higher-up Al Qaeda official and foot soldier were somehow linked . Even though the FBI and CIA used the same source to identify the men in the photos , the agencies did not talk with each other and find a way to fit their separate pieces together . <p> Besides the lack of communication , there were follow-through issues as well . In May 2001 , for example , there was a huge uptick in " chatter , " intelligence jargon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CIA official who had been assigned to work with FBI agents in their international terrorism department began to speculate about where such an Al Qaeda strike might take place . <p> The 9/11 commission calls this man John . He , too , recalled the January 2000 Kuala Lumpur meeting and decided to plumb the CIA 's databases for more information . In mid-May , John and another CIA official examined several agency cables - the reports officers in the field send back to headquarters . He saw that Midhar had a US visa and that Hazmi had arrived in Los Angeles on Jan. 15 , 2000 . <p> John then held a lengthy back-and-forth with a CIA analyst to evaluate the cables . John saw the connections between the Khallads and concluded that " something bad was definitely up . " <p> But , according to the report , he focused on Malaysia . This , the staff report concludes , is indicative of the way the two different cultures operate and why it is so difficult for them to marry up . The CIA was focused more broadly on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build a case against one person . <p> " The CIA 's zone defense concentrated on where , not who , " the staff report says . " Had its information been shared with the FBI , a combination of the CIA 's zone defense and the FBI 's man-to-man approach might have been far more productive . " <p> One final opportunity to impede the 9/11 attackers arose in the summer of 2001 . John , the CIA official who 'd been detailed to the FBI , asked a counterpart , called Mary , from the FBI who 'd been assigned to the CIA to review the Kuala Lumpur material . <p> Mary began reviewing that cable traffic on July 24 . She soon discovered a cable reporting that Midhar , too , had a US visa . A week later she found one reporting that Midhar 's visa application listed New York City as his destination . Then , on Aug. 21 , she found the March 2000 cable that " noted with interest " that Hazmi had flown to Los Angeles in January 2000 . " She grasped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> Mary and Jane on the trail <p> Mary worked with another FBI analyst on the case , referred to as Jane . Together they met with an immigration official on Aug. 22 , who told them that Midhar arrived in the US on Jan. 15 , 2000 , and again on July 4 , 2001 . They also learned there was no record that Hazmi had left since January 2001 . The two decided that if the men were in the US , they must be found . They divided up the work : Mary worked with the CIA to place the two names on international watch lists , and Jane assumed responsibility for the hunt inside the US . Jane drafted a memo outlining why these two men should be found and questioned by the FBI 's field office in New York , and called an agent there to give him a heads up . But her memo was n't sent until Aug. 28 , and it was labeled " routine . " <p> The agents opened a case , but what ensued is tragic . Agents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between criminal and intelligence cases . <p> " The result , " the staff report says , " was that criminal agents who were knowledgeable about the Cole and experienced with criminal investigative techniques , including finding suspects and possible criminal charges , were excluded from the search . " <p> The report wraps up the segment on these three missed opportunities with gut-wrenching conclusions . " Both Hazmi and Midhar could have been held for immigration violations or as material witnesses in the Cole bombing case , " it concludes . " Investigation or interrogation of these individuals , and their travel and financial activities , also may have yielded evidence of connections to other participants in the 9/11 plot .
