The no-holds-barred memoir from the beloved music superstar // From the heart of one of the most beloved performers in music comes a candid memoir of professional triumph , private heartbreak , and personal victory-a coming-of-age account of a very private search for harmony and a very public rise to fame . // Coming Home to Myself is the result of that emotional journey-a song of personal discovery that taught Wynonna Judd to love not just what she does , but who she is . From a truly exceptional woman comes an unexpected memoir of survival , strength , hope , and forgiveness , filled with an exultant and empowering message certain to resonate with those who have dreamed of finding themselves , and who only needed the courage and inspiration to begin their own journey . // Do n't miss Wynonna on The Oprah Winfrey Show on September 27th. // As spring replaced winter , Ashley and I fell asleep each night to the sounds of crickets and frogs , and awakened each morning to the birds singing . Flowers bloomed , and finally that summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pick the berries , then sit on the back porch and eat them until our faces were stained blue-black . There was always something to look forward to . // Our house was so far off the beaten path that there were days that we never saw a single soul or made it into a town . We seldom ate in restaurants or went to movies . But Dad was happier than I 'd ever seen him , and it made me happy just to see him content . He 'd run a trot fishing line across the river and bait twenty or more hooks to catch fish . At night Ashley and I swam out to check them . He 'd watch as we 'd swing from vines into the river . We 'd take bars of soap and go out in the huge front yard that filled with water in places during a thunderstorm and take baths . Sometimes we 'd play in the rain . I find myself going out into the rain with my children , just to feel that same joy from such a wonderful time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Camp Wig that was defining for me . As harsh as the conditions were at times , it was also peaceful . We had very little , but we relied on one another . It felt natural for me to be there . The lifestyle was simple and the people were real . We had lots of gatherings with neighbors where people played musical instruments and sang . Dad loved the Stones , Warren Zevon and Frank Zappa , so this was where I developed a real passion for rock ' n ' roll and for my first ( s ) hero , Joni Mitchell . Mom , Dad , Ashley and I were together . And we were family . //
