The Singing Children // Let me tell you a story on Sam . Sam was always ambitious . He always knew exactly what he wanted to do . When we was very little boys , we were playing , and he had these popsicle sticks-you know them little wooden sticks ? He had about twenty of them , and he lined them sticks up , stuck ' em in the ground , and said , " This is my audience , see ? I 'm gon na sing to these sticks . " He said , " This prepare me for my future . " Another time he said , " Hey , C. , you know what ? " I said , " What ? " He said , " I figured out my life , man . " He said , " I 'm never gon na have a nine-to-five job . " I said , " What you mean , Sam ? " He said , " Man , I figured out the whole system . " He said , " It 's designed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do is live from payday to payday-at the end of the week you broke again . " He said , " The system is designed like that . " And I 'm listening . I 'm seven and he 's nine , and he 's talking about " the system " ! I said , " What are you gon na do , then , if you ai n't gon na work , Sam ? " He said , " I 'm gon na sing , and I 'm going to make me a lot of money . " And that 's just what he did . - L.C. Cooke , on his brother 's early ambitions // Sam cook was a golden child around whom a family mythology was constructed , long before he achieved fame or added the e to his last name . // There are all the stories about Sam as a child : how he was endowed with second sight ; how he sang to the sticks ; how he convinced his neighborhood " gang " to tear the slats off backyard fences , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was marked with a gift from earliest childhood on and never wavered from its fulfillment. // He was the adored middle child of a Church of Christ ( Holiness ) minister with untrammeled ambitions for his children . // Movies were strictly forbidden .

Church took up all day Sunday , with preparations starting on Saturday night . // They were respectable , upwardly mobile , proud members of a proudly striving community , but they did n't shrink from a fight . Their daddy told them to stand up for themselves and their principles , no matter what the situation was . Respect your elders , respect authority-but if you were in the right , do n't back down for anyone , not the police , not the white man , not anyone . One time neighborhood bullies tried to block Sam 's way to school , and he told them he did n't care if he had to fight them every day , he was going to school . He lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be rewarded , but he could see evidence to the contrary all around him . Their father told them that their true reward would come in heaven , but Sam was unwilling to wait . He was unwilling to live in a world of superstition and fear , and even his father 's strictures and homilies were subject to the same rational skepticism , the same unwavering gaze with which he seemed to have been born . He was determined to live his life by his own lights and no one else's. // He was born January 22 , 1931 , in Clarksdale , Mississippi , the fifth of the Reverend Charles Cook and his wife Annie Mae 's eight children ( the oldest , Willie , was Annie Mae 's first cousin , whom they took in at three upon his mother 's death ) . Charles and Annie Mae met at a Church of Christ ( Holiness ) convention at which he was preaching , and they started going to church together . He was a young widower of twenty-three with a child that was being raised by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jackson , Mississippi , in 1897 , he had been baptized into the Holiness church at the age of eight , and when the church split in two a couple of years later ( its founders , Charles Price Jones and Charles Harrison Mason , differed over the importance of speaking in tongues as certain confirmation of " spirit baptism , " with Mason declaring this surrender to a force that overcomes recognizable human speech to be a sure sign of grace ) , the Cooks remained with the Jackson-based Reverend Jones , while Reverend Mason 's followers became the better-known , more populous ( and more prosperous ) Memphis-based Church of God in Christ . // Just fourteen when she met Charles , Annie Mae was fair-skinned , round-faced , with hair she could sit on . She was sixteen when they married in November of 1923 . She had grown up in Mound Bayou , a self-sufficient all-black township founded in 1887 and known as " the negro capital of Mississippi .

She was working as a cook when she met her future husband and by her husband 's account won him over with her culinary skills , inviting him home from church one day and producing a four-course meal in the forty-five minutes between services . // They had three children ( Mary , Charles Jr. , and Hattie ) , spaced eighteen months to two years apart , before Sam was born in January of 1931 , with his brother L.C. ( " it do n't stand for nothing " ) following twenty-three months later . // Within weeks of L.C. 's birth Charles Cook was on the road , hitchhiking to Chicago with a fellow preacher with thirty-five cents in his pocket . It was the Lord who had convinced him he could n't fail , but it was his children 's education , and the opportunity he was determined to give them to get ahead , that provided the burning motivation . He had sharecropped , worked on the railroad , and most recently been a houseboy in one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord 's work as a Holiness circuit preacher-but he was not prepared to consign his children to the same fate . He was thirty-five years old at the time , and as certain of his reasons sixty-three years later . " It was to educate my children . It was a better chance up here . In Mississippi they did n't even furnish you with the schoolbooks . But I did n't put nothing ahead of God . " // Charles Cook preached his way to Chicago , " mostly for white folks , they give me food and money , " he said , for a sermon that satisfactorily answered the " riddle " of salvation , " proving that man could pray his self out of hell . " Within weeks of his arrival , he had found work and sent for his wife and children , who arrived on a Greyhound bus at the Twelfth Street station , the gateway to Chicago 's teeming South Side . // It was a whole different world in Chicago , a separate self-contained world in which the middle class mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and preachers and schoolteachers strove to establish standards and set realistic expectations for a community that included every type of individual engaged in every type of human endeavor , from numbers kings to domestics , from street players to steel workers , from race heroes to self-made millionaires . It was a society which , despite a form of segregation as cruel and pernicious as the Southern kind , could not be confined or defined , a society of which almost all of its variegated members , nearly every one of them an immigrant from what was commonly referred to as South America , felt an integral part . It was a society into which the Cook family immediately fit . // From the moment of his arrival , Reverend Cook found his way to Christ Temple Cathedral , an imposing edifice which the Church of Christ ( Holiness ) had purchased for $55,000 six years earlier , just ten years after its modest prayer-meeting beginnings in the Federal Street home of Brother Holloway . He preached an occasional sermon and served as a faithful congregant and assistant pastor while working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ selling burial insurance , before he found steady employment at the Reynolds Metals plant in McCook , Illinois , some fifteen miles out of town , where he would eventually rise to a position as union shop steward . // The family lived briefly in a kitchenette apartment on Thirty-third and State but soon moved into more comfortable surroundings on the fourth floor of the four-story Lenox Building , at 3527 Cottage Grove Avenue ( there were five separately numbered entrances to the Lenox Building , with the back porches all interconnected ) , in the midst of a busy neighborhood not far from the lake . There was a drugstore on the corner , the Blue Goose grocery store was just up the street , and directly across from the Blue Goose was a chicken market where you could select your own live chicken and have it killed and dressed on the spot . Westpoint Baptist Church was on the other side of the street , all the players hung out at the poolroom on Thirty-sixth , and Ellis Park , an elegant enclave of privately owned row houses surrounding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran between Thirty-sixth and Thirty-seventh across Cottage Grove . // The new baby , Agnes , was almost two years old when Reverend Cook , through the intervention of one of his original Jackson mentors , Bishop J. L. I. Conic , finally got his own congregation at Christ Temple Church in Chicago Heights , some thirty miles out of town . This quickly became the focus of the Cooks ' family life . // We was in church every time that church door was open . That was a must , no ifs , ands , or buts about it . Saturday night Mama would cook our dinner . Then we 'd all get up about 6:30 Sunday morning , ' cause everyone had to take their bath-seven children , one bathroom ! - so we could be dressed and be at church at nine o'clock for Sunday school . After Sunday school you had eleven o'clock service , with prayer and singing , and Papa would do the sermon for the day . Then Mama would take us to the basement and heat up our food in the church kitchen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BYPU , which is a young people 's service , then the eight o'clock service until about 10 o'clock , when we would go home . Plus Wednesday night prayer meeting ! One time Mary , our oldest sister-she was used to doing what she wanted-decided she was n't going to go to church . She said , " I know what I 'm gon na do . I 'm going to wash my hair , and then I 'm going to tell Papa , ' I ca n't go to church ' cause I just got my hair washed , and I have n't got it done . ' " Well , she washed her hair , and she told Papa , but he just said , " That 's all right , just come right on . " So she had to go to church with her hair all a mess . Papa did n't play . You had to either go to church or get out of his house . - Hattie , Agnes , and L.C.

The " seventeen " previous ministers , he told gospel historian David Tenenbaum , had been able to do nothing to increase the size or fervor of a congregation made up for the most part of workers from the local Ford assembly plant , but , Reverend Cook said , " I worked up to one hundred and twenty-five , I filled the church up . You had to be sure to come there on time if you wanted a seat . " // He was , according to his daughter Agnes , a " fire-and-brimstone country preacher " who always sang before he preached , strictly the old songs-two of his favorites were " You Ca n't Hurry God " and " This Little Light of Mine . " He took his sermon from a Bible text and was known to preach standing on one leg for two minutes at a time when he got carried away by his message . The congregation was vocal in its response , shouting , occasionally speaking in tongues , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to any of the congregation who were overcome . The Cooks did n't shout , but Annie Mae would cry sometimes , her children could always tell when the sermon really got to her and her spirit was full by the tears streaming down her cheeks . The other ladies in the congregation were equally moved , for despite his stern demeanor , the Reverend Cook was a handsome man-and despite his numerous strictures , as his children were well aware , the Reverend Cook definitely had an eye for the ladies . Annie Mae sang in the choir , which was accompanied by a girl named Flora on piano , and different groups would come out occasionally to present spiritual and gospel music programs . One group in particular , the Progressive Moaners , became regular visitors-they always got a good response-and that is what gave the Reverend Cook the idea for the Singing Children . // The Cook children were all musical , but Charles , the next-to-oldest , was the heart and soul of the family group . He was eleven , " and I had to sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sing all the time , stop me from going out in the street and playing with my friends . " He and his big sister , Mary , sang lead in the five-member quartet . Hattie , who was eight , sang baritone ; Sam , already focused on music as a career at six , sang tenor ; and L.C. , the baby of the group , was their four-year-old bass singer . // They practiced at home at first but soon were " upsetting " the church on a regular basis , taking the Progressive Moaners ' place at the center of the service and in the process reflecting as much on their father , Reverend Cook , as on themselves . They sang " Precious Lord , Take My Hand " and " They Nailed Him to the Cross " with Flora accompanying them . " We just practiced our own selves and decided what songs we was going to sing , " recalled Hattie . " Every time the church doors opened we had to be there . " // Before long they were going around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revivals in Indianapolis and Gary and Kankakee . The entire family traveled together , all nine of them , generally staying with the minister , but not infrequently having to split up among various church households due to the size of the group . Each of the Singing Children had a freshness and charm . They were a good-looking family , even the boys had pretty , long bangs , and the church ladies used to cluck over that baby bass singer who put himself into the music so earnestly , and the handsome lead singer-he was a big boy who carried himself in a manly fashion-but no one missed the little tenor singer , either , the one with the sparkle in his eye , who could just melt your heart with the way he communicated the spirit of the song . Sometimes , when he got too many preaching engagements , Reverend Cook would send them to sing in his place . " When they 'd come back , the people would tell me , say , ' Anytime you ca n't come , Preach , just send the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were proud of what they were doing , both for themselves and for their father . And their father was proud of them , not only for causing the Cook family sound ( his sound ) to become more widely known but for adding substantially to his store of entrepreneurial activities : the church , the revivals , the riders he carried out to Reynolds each day for a fee in his nearly brand-new 1936 Chevrolet , soon to be replaced by a Hudson Terraplane , and , when Charles was old enough to drive , a pair of limousines ( " Brother , I made my money ! " he was wont to declare in later years with unabashed pride ) . // But Charles , a gruff , sometimes taciturn boy with a disinclination to show his sensitivity , soon grew disenchanted with the spotlight . " Aw , man , my daddy used to make me sing too much . I used to get so tired of singing I said , I 'm gon na get up there and mess up , and he wo n't ask me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , that song would get so good , shit , I could n't mess up . I could n't mess up . But I said , if I ever get grown , if I ever make twenty-one , I 'm not going to sing for nobody . And I didn't. " // Meanwhile , Sam , the irrepressible middle child , made no secret of his own impatience for the spotlight . Even L.C. , who slept in the same room with him and appreciated wholeheartedly his brother 's wit and spark , was taken aback by Sam 's undisguised ambition . Charles could easily have resented his brother 's importunity , but instead he retained a strictly pragmatic point of view . " Well , he had such a pretty little tenor-I mean , it was kind of undescribable , his tone , his singing . But we did n't have nobody to replace him . So we would n't let him lead . We were the lead singers , my sister and I. We pretty much had the say-so . " // It was a busy life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocks west of the Lenox Building , and they were all expected to do well . Both parents checked their homework , though even at an early age the children became aware that their mother possessed more formal schooling than their father , and she would even substitute-teach at Doolittle on occasion . Reverend Cook , on the other hand , conveyed a kind of uncompromising rectitude and pride , which , in all of their recollection , he was determined to instill in his children . " He had a saying , " said his youngest daughter , Agnes , " that he would write in everybody 's course book when they graduated , and he would recite it to you constantly : ' Once a task is once begun / Never stop until it 's done / Be the labor great or small / Do it well or not at all .

' He always felt that you could do anything that you put your mind to . " //
