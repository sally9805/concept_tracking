They used to call it Black Broadway : the stretch of U Street in northwest Washington where the likes of Billie Holiday , Duke Ellington , Cab Calloway , Ella Fitzgerald , Louis Armstrong and John Coltrane performed nightly . Then , in the 1960s , the neighborhood fell victim to urban blight as riots burned down much of the commercial district and affluent blacks moved to the suburbs . But these days efforts by local families to revive the area are taking hold . The result is a lively mix of recharged African-American culture and hip new shops and restaurants  --  less than 10 minutes from the National Mall and all those K Street lobbyists . <P> Washington 's tourist routes are well trod , but U Street is n't playing to outsiders : it 's where young , creative Washingtonians go to shake off their political straitjackets . It 's also home to some of the city 's richest but oft-forgotten cultural history . Back in the U Street corridor 's heyday , the place to be on a Saturday night was the Lincoln Theatre . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a peek inside ( the theater 's been restored and again hosts performances ) , as well as offering stops at two of Duke Ellington 's childhood homes , the African American Civil War Memorial ( the museum is down the block ) and the Thurgood Marshall Center  --  a building that was the nation 's first YMCA for blacks and Langston Hughes ' home during the ' 20s . The tour costs $10 and meets the first and third Saturdays of the month at the U Street/ Cardozo Metro station at 13th and U streets . <P> The best thing about U Street is that great jazz once again grooves there . Bo- hemian Caverns , at 11th Street and U , offers nightly shows , plus food named after musical legends  --  the Miles Davis is a lamb kabob  --  many of whom performed at the dark , moody venue built to look like a cave . For an artsier scene , check out U-topia , at 1418 U Street , which has live music every night and a full menu . HR-57 , named after a congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances Wednesday through Saturday , at 1610 14th Street . The ambience is laid back ; you can bring your own beer or wine for a $3 corking fee . <P> No visit to U Street is complete without a meal at Ben 's Chili Bowl , a neighborhood institution between 12th and 13th streets . Virginia Ali , who opened the restaurant with her husband in 1958 , recommends the Chili Half-Smoke , a split-open sausage with chili , mustard and onions  --  the favorite , she notes , of Bill Cosby , who courted his wife at Ben 's . Another great eatery is Love Cafe ( 1501 U ) , a coffeehouse that gets its sweets from the bakery across the street . For dinner , try Rice , a Thai restaurant at 1608 14th Street , or Opera , at 1324 U , for upscale Italian ( Wednesday through Saturday only ) . Another fine option is one of the area 's many Ethiopian restaurants , such as Dukem , at 1114 U. <P> Before you leave U Street , take some time to wander . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Duke Ellington mural , or eye-catching , like the glassware in Go Mama Go ! , at 1809 14th Street . In fact , more than 100 businesses have opened during the past two years  --  a sure sign that U is back .
