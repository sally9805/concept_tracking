Mouse had changed . Before he announced his engagement to EttaMae he was a happy man , full of himself . It 's true that he was especially pleased when misfortune happened to someone else , but at least he kept us smiling . Life was hard back then and a good laugh was worth a month of Sundays . But just when he had a reason to be glad , Mouse turned sour and moody . He let his appearance go to seed ( he was usually a natty dresser ) and nobody wanted to be around him because when a small , rodent-faced man like Mouse got ugly , he was no company even for the harshest man . He stopped going to parties altogether . If you happened to run into him on some corner , or back alley , and asked how he was doing , he 'd say , " What the hell you think ? Here I am gon na get married in two months an ' ' tween me an ' EttaMae we ai n't got enough money for dip an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for work . All he did was get mad whenever he had to let go of a few coins . So it was no surprise that his crowd started to shun him . I mean , even if you wanted to see Mouse it was hard work because he changed apartments almost every month  --  one step ahead of the landlord , as we used to say . I did n't want to see him . Mostly because I was jealous . You see , EttaMae was the kind of woman you had on your mind when you woke up in the morning . She was big and friendly , and always knew the right thing to say . But she never lied ; Etta spoke her mind , and when she laughed it came from her heart . Everybody loved EttaMae , and she loved the only man I ever knew who did n't have a heart at all . So between me being jealous and Mouse being so taciturn , I was surprised late one Tuesday night when a racket broke out at my apartment door . It sounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself out of a deep sleep trying to think of who might be after me . I knew that it could n't be the police , they just broke the door down in that neighborhood , and I had n't seen any seriously married women in more than six months . " Hold on ! " I yelled , thinking about the back window . I was reaching for the butcher 's knife on the nightstand when he called , " Easy ! Easy ! Open this do ' , man , I got ta talk ! " " Mouse ? " " Yeah , man ! Lemme in ! " I snatched the door open with a curse on my lips but when I saw him I knew he 'd changed again . He had on a plaid zoot suit with Broadway suspenders and spats on his black bluchers . He wore a silk hat and when he smiled you could see the new gold rim and blue jewel on his front tooth . For someone who never worked , Mouse knew how to keep himself in style . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I got ta work in the mo'nin ' ! " He pushed by me saying , " That 's all right , Easy , I'ma buy some'a yo ' time this week . " A tan rucksack hung from his shoulder . I could hear the chink of bottles as it swung against his side . " We got ta talk , man , " he said . He led the way back into my apartment . All it was was a big room with a Murphy bed . He sat down on the good chair and I sat on the bed , facing him . " Mouse , what do you ... " He held up his hand , half smiling like one of those saints in the illustrated Bibles . " Easy , I have got it . " He pulled Johnnie Walker from the sack . " I have got it , " he said . " Now do you got some glasses ? ' Cause this here 's Black Label and it wo n't do to swig it from the neck . " " Man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glasses , Easy , so we can celebrate my good fortune . You the first one gon na know . " " Know what ? All I know is I got ta get me some sleep . " " Then get me sumpin ' t'drink wit ' and I will deliver you the potion of dreams . " There was no use in trying to argue when Mouse was in a preaching mood . There were glasses in the closet at the back of the room . I rinsed them in a tub I kept back there . " Jelly glasses ? " Mouse turned up his nose while he poured . " Just ... just ... what do you want ? " He lay back in my stuffed chair and put his feet on my sheets . He flashed his new gold tooth at me and drank whiskey like it was water . " You know I 'm from down Pariah , Easy . Yes , sir ! Just a country boy . " He poured another glassful . " Down home , that 's me . " I poured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his story . He was afraid that the idea would get confused unless you had all the facts . If he was to tell you about a nail in a horse 's foot he 'd start off explaining coal and iron and how they make steel . " ... an ' you know us country boys is slow to get a idee , but once we got the picture we ai n't never gon na let go .... You got a cigarette ? " " Got some papers an ' shag . " " Uh-uh , no thanks . You know I cai n't stand them leaves in my mouf . " He twisted his lips and slugged back his second glass of scotch . " I guess you know I been kinda worried with the weddin ' an ' how me an ' Etta ai n't wit ' much dough . " " Yeah , I know . " " Well , I got it all figgered out now . " Mouse smiled so satisfied that I felt good . But I said , " Com'on , man , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What ? " He looked at me real close then , like a dog does when a new smell comes by . Like he was wondering if I was food or foe or some love interest . He said , " You like Etta , do n't ya , Easy ? " " Yeah , sure I like her . " I did n't like that question , though . " Etta been hangin ' out wit ' us fo'years . " " Yeah , that 's true , " Mouse said , staring down into his jelly glass . Then he looked up at me . " But you like'er more'n just some friend . I mean , she 's a good-lookin ' woman , right ? " " She look fine . Now what 's this about yo ' stepdaddy ? " But he would n't let it go . " She look good , but that 's not what make her so fine . Etta ai n't no bow-down woman , she stand up fo ' what she want . An ' no one better be foolin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cause Etta got a strong arm . " I laughed and said yeah but I was watching Mouse then . For all my size that small man scared me . Mouse was laughing too , but his eyes were on mine . " That 's the truth , " he said . " An ' they ai n't a real man who do n't wonder what a powerful woman like that can do . ' Cause you know the first time I seen Etta sit down to a plate'a food I knew she was a hungry woman . " He ran the length of his hand down his crotch . " Yeah , that Etta will eat you up ! " I poured out a little scotch and wondered if that was going to be my last drink . He held my eye while he poured whiskey , while he drank . I could hear the house settling , it was so quiet . " Why'ont you roll me one , Ease ? You got the touch . " The pouch was on the end table , next to the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I was doing . I had to suck my tongue to get enough spit to wet the paper . " Yeah . You know Etta wring me out and in the mo'nin ' she tell me that if I wan na keep that good stuff fo'me I better do right . " He laughed . " And she knew I had plenty'a women t'buy my clothes . An ' I knew she were n't no virgin neither .... But I can understand a man , Easy . " Mouse leaned back quickly and put his hand into his pocket . I flinched and the tobacco and paper fell to the floor . " ... a man , " he continued as he came out with a red handkerchief to wipe his nose , " who run after a woman like that wit ' his nose open an ' his tongue hangin ' down . " I had been down in Galveston once when EttaMae lived there . I spent the night with her even though I knew she was Mouse 's girl . He must 've found out , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next morning all Etta could talk about was how sweet a man Mouse was and how lucky I was to have him for a friend . There I was facing a jealous fianc when Etta had glazed over me like so much meat . Mouse was smiling and I believe that he knew what I was thinking . I gave up trying to roll the cigarette ; all I could do was stare at him and try not to look concerned . Somebody might wonder why a big man like me would be scared of a small man , half his size . But size does n't count for much in this world . I once saw Mouse put a knife in a big man 's gut . I was drunk and that man , Junior Fornay was his name , was after me because he thought the girl I was with was his . He ripped off his shirt and came after me bare-fisted and bare-chested . They cleared the barroom and we went at it . But I was drunk and Junior was one of those field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He pounded me until I hit the floor and then he started kicking . I balled up to try and save myself but you know I could hear my dead mother that night : She was calling my name . That 's when Mouse strolled up . Junior waved a piece of furniture at him but Mouse just put his hand in the air . I swear he could n't reach as high as Junior 's forehead but he said , " He got his lesson , man , you got ta let him live so he can learn . " " You better git ... " was all Junior could say before Mouse had his stiletto buried , maybe just half an inch , in the field hand 's gut . I was lying between them , looking up . I could see Mouse smiling and I could see Junior 's face grow pale . Mouse quick-grabbed Junior 's neck with his free hand and said , " You better drop that stick or I'ma stir the soup , boy . " I think I would rather have the beating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I was listening to Mouse with great respect . " ... but you know , Easy , all that is past . I ai n't the type'a man to bear no grudge . Po ' men cai n't afford no grudge . Shit ! It 's hard enough for a po ' man t'get through the day . " He slapped my knee and leaned back in the chair . When he threw his leg over the armrest I knew I was safe . " S-so , what ' bout yo ' stepdaddy ? " I asked . " Yeah . " Mouse stared at the ceiling with a smile . " You got that cigarette yet ? " I started rolling again . " Yeah , my stepdaddy got a big pile'a money out on that farm somewhere . Big pile . " " He wan na give you some'a that ? " " Well , we ai n't on the best terms  --  me an ' Daddy Reese . You know he 's a farm boy down t'his nuts an ' he see everything like a farmer see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was the runt'a the litter and I should be put in a burlap sack and dumped in the river . " Mouse was smiling but he was n't happy . " Shoo , man ! Even a farmer love his chirren . " " I ai n't none'a his . My momma had me when she was still footloose an ' feelin ' good . Daddy Reese come nosin ' around later . " " So how 's that gon na help you and Etta ? " Mouse pulled up his pant leg , leaned forward , and slapped my knee again . He said , " That 's just what I been thinkin ' , Easy . How one rich ole hick gon na help me when he cai n't stand my face ? I been thinkin ' ' bout that fo ' days . I go t'sleep thinkin ' ' bout it an ' then I wake up in the same frame'a mind . " You know I went down to Galveston ' cause Etta wanted me t'see if I could get sumpin ' down on the docks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shit ! But I went down there because you got ta respect yo ' woman . " That was Mouse to a word . Children loved him and their mothers did too . " I was down on the docks eatin ' a sandwich and watchin ' the boys down there . They had this game they played . You see , in the hot day them ship rats crawl up on the top'a the pilin 's to git some sun . They just lay out in the sun an ' bake with they long nekked tails hangin ' down an ' wavin ' ' round the logs . Uh ! It 's disgustin ' . But anyway , them boys sneak up to where the rats is an ' they wait real quiet right next to the tail . " Mouse sat up straight and clapped his hands like a gunshot . " Then they grab the tail an ' swing that rat through the air till it smash on the pier ! Oh , man , that was sumpin ' ! I watched ' em do that fo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them things .... Then I caught a ride on a vegetable truck comin ' back t'Houston . I was still thinkin ' ' bout them boys , when it hit me . You know I kept thinkin ' that those boys could n't hesitate a minute ' cause that rat is ready t'bite the first thing you touch'im , an ' you know the on'y thing worse than a rat bite is a man bite . " Mouse sat back , showing his teeth . I handed him the cigarette and he lit it up . He lay back and took a deep draw . It looked like he was through talking , so I asked , " So what , man ? What you gon na do ' bout the money ? " " I'ma go up to Pariah an ' get it , that 's what . " " How you gon na do that ? " " I do n't know , Easy . All I can tell ya is that I ai n't gon na hesitate one minute . " Mouse wanted something from me , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I was too stubborn to give in to that . So he puffed on his cigarette and I fumbled around with my glass . When he 'd look at me I 'd just look back . Mouse had light gray eyes . Finally he said , " So , Easy , what you workin ' at now ? " " Gardenin ' for the Lewis fam'ly . They man is sick . " " You know how t'drive a car , right ? " " Yeah . " " I tell you what . I give ya fifteen dollars t'drive me to Pariah fo'a couple ' a days . " " Shit ! " " Yeah , man , I ai n't lyin ' . " " Let 's see it . " Mouse got that wary dog look again and said in a quiet voice , " I ai n't never asked you t'prove nuthin ' , Easy . " I knew right then that he wanted to trade ; that he 'd forget about me and Etta if I 'd drive him to Pariah for a fifteen-dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care about me and his woman ; the only thing that ever got Mouse mad was if you played with his money or caught him in a lie . This was just business , plain and simple . " What kinda car you got ? " " ' Thirty-six Ford . Drive so smooth you think you was in a boat . " " Now where you gon na get a car like that an ' you do n't even drive ? " " Otum Chenier want me t'take care of it while he gone down Lake Charles . " Mouse grinned and rubbed his chin . " Seem like one'a his folks is sick . " " And when you wan na go ? " I asked . " Maybe half hour ' fore dawn . " " Tomorrah ? " " Com'on , Ease . It 's late . I got business down south an ' I'ma pay you fo'it too . I ai n't got no time t'waste . " " I got a job , man . " " Easy , you work fo'them three weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they man is back you know they gon na put yo ' butt out . An ' I got food , an ' whiskey , an ' gas money . I know ev'ry pretty girl in Pariah . An ' , man , Etta deserve a good weddin ' , ' cause you know she sumpin ' else . " He winked at that . I wanted to go . I knew it from the minute he yelled in my door . I was a young man then , barely nineteen years old , and alone in the world . Mouse was my only real friend , and even though he was crazy and wild I knew he cared for me  --  in his way . He made me mad sometimes but that 's what good friends and family do . I was n't mad because Mouse had won Etta . I was mad because when they got married I was going to lose my friend to his wife and family . This was going to be the last time we would go running in the streets together . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IOU . " I want my fifteen dollars , man , " I said . " You know I ai n't doin ' this fo'my health . " " Do n't you worry ' bout a thing , Easy . We both git sumpin ' outta this . " Mouse was curled up in my secondhand upholstered chair like a little boy . The room was all kinds of gray from light that leaked in through the torn shades and the cracks in the door . He fell asleep as soon as the light went out , but I woke up then . I lay there in the dark thinking about the time Mouse had saved my life . I remembered Junior holding his bloody shirt and running from the bar . Then I thought of what Mouse had said when I tried to thank him . " Shit , man , I di n't save you . I just wanted to cut that boy ' cause he think he so bad .... See what he think now .... " And we never talked about it again .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
