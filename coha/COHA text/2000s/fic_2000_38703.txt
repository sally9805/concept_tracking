SHE REMEMBERED THAT IN THE STORY , the family could n't find an old house in the woods . It seemed full of meaning . And that the grandmother 's cat was named Pity Sing . <p> She was an ex-nun traveling to Macon , Georgia , because there was a story somewhere in the trip : her sister 's husband 's kin , murder , mayhem , betrayal . Louie did n't know why she had come all the way from New York City for a history that was n't hers-maybe for comparison , maybe for some kind of consolation . On the way down to Macon from Atlanta , she tried to say something like this to Jemma , tried to tell her about leaving the Sisters of Mercy , the married man she thought she was in love with , an Episcopal minister , how he kept promising he 'd leave his wife , though she now knew he never would . <p> But after a sentence or two , through which her sister only said The bastard , and never took her eyes off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents ' old house , sold nine months before , how they both dreamed about it , how they wanted to go back and buy it but never could . <p> " Have you driven by there since you 've been back ? " Jemma asked . <p> " You know , it 's funny . I did . Just the other day . I forgot to avoid the street , and when I realized where I was , I looked , and it sort of was n't there . With all the construction and landscaping they 're doing , it 's hard to find the old house in all the mess . " <p> Louie talked . Jemma was pregnant with her first child , and she had gone away somewhere inside herself , to dote on her child , protect it . These were the last weeks she would ever be alone with her baby-in two months the world would call the baby from her , and the baby would go , and if she ever tried to call him back , he might spring away in hatred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " The gray one . " But she did n't stop the car in front , and Louie thought she 'd changed her mind , that the baby told her something , Keep going , not here , little momma . They traveled slowly to the top of Spring Street-a strange , steep hillside , it seemed , in the very center of the flat plate of Middle Georgia-turned in front of the Catholic church , and headed back down . " There 's Ruth 's car . " Ruth was Jemma 's mother-in-law . " I wonder why she 's here . " <p> " Goodness , " Louie said . Hung on the middle of the hill , the house seemed huge and empty and unmoored , as if the absence of bodies inside allowed it to float . Toys littered the front porch : a Big Wheel leaned on its side , a brown rocking horse on blown springs that seemed to be nosing through the slats in the fallen porch railing , wanting to escape . Louie 's first thought was that no pregnant woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jemma 's arm as they crossed the street . <p> " Are there kids here , Jem ? " <p> Before her sister could answer , the screen door flew open and three women rushed toward Jemma , their arms held out in welcome . Ca n't wait to get ahold of you , they said , though Louie thought they looked like blind women feeling their way , their hands fluttering ahead of them in search of danger . After a few seconds , she saw the women all wore dark glasses , and something like horror froze her blood : Blind women are taking us on this tour ! But no , she realized , it was only that they were ready to go-the rain made the light a little glary , and they hated the idea of more squint-lines . <p> Louie remembered them from Jemma 's wedding , two-and-a-half years before : Ruth , who was a head taller than the others , had been warm to Louie , but always dignified , something about her a little afraid , gray eyes always looking past a person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desire to touch Jemma , bearer of her first grandchild , but she stood back , with Louie , while the other two patted Jemma 's belly , stroked her hair , took stock of her visible health . Jemma bore it patiently , as an animal would . When she called to Louie , her voice came out like lowing , baying . <p> " Lou ? Remember Aunt Mary ? And Penny ? " <p> " Hello , " Louie said . " It 's been a while . " <p> Mary and Penny unclasped themselves from Jemma and took Louie 's hands , left and right . They looked her over , for signs . They had never seen an ex-nun before . <p> " We 're so glad you 're interested in this story , " Mary said . <p> " We do n't know what to make of it , " Penny said , and Louie wondered whether she meant the story or her wanting to know it . <p> " But you 're the only one who can do it justice . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in someone 's telling of her story she had become a shadowy , exotic literary figure , and part of her welcomed the misunderstanding . She thought of herself sometimes as ex-none , so at least this fiction was a step up , more than nothing . <p> " But first , we got to go to Pete 's , " Penny said . " It 's Ruth 's birthday tomorrow , so we just got to go to Pete 's . " She turned to Louie . " I 'm just so tickled , " she said . " I found all these . " She put a thick envelope into Louie 's hands and steered her toward Mary 's car , a gold Dodge about fifteen years old . " We can all fit , " she said . " Put Jemma up front , where there 's room . " <p> They all piled in and pulled away from the gray house on Spring Street , driving north out of Macon . The car filled gradually with talk of the baby , how fast Ruth and her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of other mommas and babies , how soon it would all happen , in a heartbeat , they said , how Jemma would be happy and tired , how for the next little while she would n't know what hit her . The car grew warm as the women relaxed into one another , their soft bodies crowding around Jemma , keeping her from harm . <p> Pete 's was a barbeque joint , it took Louie until they got there to figure out . Pete himself , a huge , pale , freckled man with red hair , stood over the back wall , which was both pit and griddle . Flames shot up when he moved the great slabs of meat , or poured something from a pitcher into the fire . Ruth , Mary , and Penny ordered barbeque sandwiches and Brunswick stew , and kept their sunglasses on , as if afraid to be recognized . Jemma ate two sandwiches and two bowls of stew . The older women watched approvingly , their eyes like dark coals stuck in their heads . <p> " You got to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What if it 's twins , Penny ? " Mary said , and everyone laughed politely . Penny 's twins were twenty-four and perfect , as they had been from birth . <p> " Look out ! " Penny said . Then she pulled her dark glasses lower on her nose , peered at Jemma . " I did n't know a thing about it , " she said . " I was out cold . They do n't do that much anymore , knock the mother out cold . We were about the last ones who did n't know what was happening to us . " <p> The women nodded and ate their sandwiches , delicately , tucking stray shreds of meat back inside the bun . They drank their Co-Colas in little , silent sips . Louie had cole slaw and water . She knew if she ate a heavy meal in the middle of the day and then rode in a warm car in the rain , she would fall right to sleep . It would n't be mannerly . In a way , this whole trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , somehow , to the bosom of her family . Into the land of the living . <p> When the women had finished , Mary got up , went around to the counter , and came back with three slices of layer cake-maple , lemon , and chocolate . " For Ruth 's birthday , " she said . " Ladies ? Shall we sing ? " <p> " You certainly shall not , " Ruth said , but she looked happy in her dignified way , Louie thought . <p> Jemma kicked Louie under the table . " Remind me to get her a card , " she whispered . " I forgot . I ca n't remember anything these days . " <p> Pete came over to wish Ruth a happy birthday . " No candles in here , ladies , " he said with a high , shrieking laugh . " It 's a fire hazard . And no singing . I ca n't abide no singing , except my own . " He smiled at Jemma . " About to have another birthday , ai n't we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it was locked away inside with the baby . It seemed to have to travel miles to get to where Pete stood , and when it arrived , her whole face looked lonely . " Pretty soon , " she said . <p> " A whole tableful of mommas , " Pete said . " ' Bout to give me a fright . " He made his great , oozy body tremble in mock fear , then walked back behind the counter . <p> " Not a whole table , " Louie said , before anyone else could . " That 's all right , " Ruth said , and patted her hand . " You never know what will happen now . " <p> " We all married young , " Penny said . " And look at us . " Louie did , and the three blind-seeming women looked back , cake crumbs at the corners of their mouths . Pete 's was filling up with men in suits and ties , businessmen who traveled from Gray and Monticello and Round Oak for barbeque . They stood with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , patient , expressionless , hanging over the women like weather , the polite threat of it . <p> " The scandal is n't any secret , " Penny said . " As you can see . " <p> Louie had opened the fat manila envelope , which contained copies of articles from the Macon Daily Telegraph , December 1912 and January 1913 . KING DID NOT DIE BY HIS OWN HAND , a headline read , MRS . KING PLOTTED TO KILL HUSBAND FOR INSURANCE , KING PLANNED TO REMOVE HIS WIFE FROM TEMPTATION , and WILL MRS . KING HANG ? <p> " But what we want to know is what happened to the children . There were six of them . And then , not a trace . They 're our kin . We want to know our kin . " <p> Mary turned into the gravel drive in front of Sunshine Church . Light rain fell steadily , and when she parked the car , the five women got out and opened their umbrellas . Louie walked up three steps to the front of the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to her surprise , unlocked . <p> " Hooray , " Penny called . " Louie , you are good luck . " <p> Inside , the little church had a dark , defeated beauty , but was much bigger than seemed possible from the outside . There were twenty rows of hard-looking pews , a simple trestle for an altar , covered with a white cloth . An unadorned wooden cross hung on the wall at the far end . Though there was nothing to keep them from doing so , none of the women crossed the threshold from the vestibule into the church . Mary and Penny moved quickly to a small table in the corner . " The guest book ! " they said to each other with a strange mixture of surprise and certainty . Louie opened her notebook and pressed in next to them-she was the designated historian , after all-but as the two women scanned the names and found several Kings from Jacksonville , Florida , they moved their shoulders closer together , edging Louie out . She stepped back and looked at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first believed was a picture of Jesus holding a child on his lap . She saw then it was not Jesus but Robert E. Lee cradling the small boy . The two were reading the Bible by the light of a candle that glowed with the same garish flame used to depict the sacred heart , disembodied and yet unbearably human , fiery , blood-drenched , and still beating . <p> The opposite wall held a bookcase , a lending library of spiritual titles-The Journey , The Message , God 's Love for Little Boys and Girls , The Ten Commandments . Atop these shelves and rising to the ceiling like towers on a castle-on the Mormon Tabernacle , Louie thought  --  was a stunning array of softball trophies . <p> " Some powerful arms in this church , " Ruth said quietly . Jemma nodded and then rubbed her belly , thinking , Louie supposed , of a future that was , wherever she went , now transformed . Robert E. Lee read to her child , the books and trophies belonged to her child , her child 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacksonville , " Penny was saying . " Maybe they all went to an orphanage in Jacksonville . Mary , what do you think ? " <p> " That could be , " Mary said . <p> " Charles King . Was n't one of the children named Charles ? The baby , was n't it ? And Nina Johnson . There was a Nina . Louie , write these down . There 's addresses , too . These could be our kin , Mary . " <p> " What if they do n't want to know us ? " <p> " Why not , Mary ? For goodness sake ! How could kin not want to know kin ? " <p> Louie recorded the names and addresses , Kings and Johnsons who had visited Sunshine Church ten years before . The rain picked up  --  they could hear it on the roof , like murmuring . The pews seemed for an instant to contain row upon row of ghosts , their backs turned away , their insubstantial faces gazing steadily into the infinite . Lost or found in this world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On Jim King 's tombstone were the words a faithful sovereign at rest . <p> " What does it mean ? " Louie asked . <p> " They all say that , just about , " Penny told her . " Except somebody down there has a whole poem telling how he 'll be in every drop of rain that falls and every breath of wind that blows . " <p> " That 's nice , " Mary said . <p> Many of the headstones , Louie noticed , had been carved to look like logs , either upright , like half-felled trees , or cut and stacked . Mary explained that these deceased were Woodmen , members of a fraternal organization of insurance-sellers . It sounded sinister and ridiculous at the same time , like the Shriners or the Masons , and Louie said so . <p> " No , no , " Penny said . " They advertise in the paper and everything . " <p> Jim King 's grave had not been taken care of . The slab covering the ground below the headstone had buckled and cracked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt-or even , with all the rain , clear down to the top of the coffin . Louie thought a skeletal hand might reach out of the earth to point or beckon . " So what exactly happened ? " she asked . <p> " He was killed with his own gun by his wife 's lover . The lover was hanged , and that 's where the story ends . " Mary said this , then exchanged a look with Penny . <p> " She , the wife , was never heard from again . She escaped from prison , or someone got her out . That 's the mystery . " <p> " Does n't anybody know ? " " Mina did , Mina was the colored woman who worked for Mary 's momma . " <p> " Mina wo n't tell ? " <p> " Mina ca n't tell . She died last January . " <p> " But she said to us once-what did she say , Mary ? Tell her exact words . " <p> " She said Y'all hush up about Kate ' - that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to find out , you 'd find out . " <p> " But we want to know about the babies . Those poor babies without a momma or a daddy . They might still be alive , the littlest ones . Or their children . " <p> " We 're curious . " <p> " And they 're our kin . And see that , Louie ? " Penny pointed to the broken stone slab . " That 's Jim King trying to come out of his grave and get you to tell this story . " <p> The idea of it made Louie go cold all over . She looked for Jemma , who was walking alone at the other end of the graveyard . The land sloped downward toward her , and it appeared as if Jemma had sunk into the earth , up to her chest , and was surrounded by stacks of marble trying to look like wood . Above her , around them all , the wet spring had turned the world impossibly green . She should n't be here , Louie thought-a pregnant woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad omen ; it 's playing with fire . She wanted to carry her sister back to the car , make Mary drive them back to Macon , but she could n't tear her eyes away from the sight of . Jemma swimming , bathing in green and stone . While Louie watched , Jemma shook her hair-she had cut it into a kind of cap in anticipation of the baby 's grasping fingers-and drops of rainwater flew like beads , caught in the odd afternoon light , and turned to silver . <p> " Would there be records , Mary ? " Penny asked as they drove through Gray , Georgia , on the way to Round Oak . " Oh , let 's stop . It wo n't take five minutes to ask . " Mary kept driving , saying she could n't handle an automobile and think at the same time . But finally she pulled into a gravel drive off the highway , backed out in the other direction , and made her turn right in the path of an eighteen-wheeler loaded with plastic pipe and barreling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brace for impact . She made a low sound in her throat and said " Holy shit , " then breathed out in a cough once they were out of danger . <p> " Mary ! " Ruth said . " Careful now . You about made Jemma have that baby right here . " <p> " Sidney might like that , " Penny said . Sidney was the baby 's grandfather . " That way he could be there first . " <p> Sidney doted on Jemma , Louie knew . He was a quiet carouser , like his son , a retired hell-raiser who had taught both his boy and Jemma to fish and shoot . He took them to hunt wild boar in south Georgia , and when Jemma got hers right between the eyes with her first shot , he was so proud he refused to let anyone eat the animal . He was best man at Jemma and Sid Jr . ' s wedding , and as he took Louie 's arm to walk her back up the aisle behind the newlyweds , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer ! " Louie loved Sidney too . She thought he might be fun to have on hand right then . <p> The town square in Gray at midafternoon seemed closed down , perhaps because the fits of rain were keeping people indoors . The True Value Hardware and the Gray Diner , on either side of the courthouse , were locked up tight , but farther down the street , Louie saw a Woolworth 's with all its lights on , and a shoe store with a sale rack out front . In a tiny park a fountain sprayed , and a soldier on horseback sat as if waiting for orders . Louie tried to remember the meaning of the horse 's hooves : Was it one raised for wounded in battle , two for killed ? Did all four hooves on the ground mean the man died peacefully in his bed ? She learned this on a tour at Gettysburg , but she knew better than to bring up that sore subject . <p> She followed Jemma and Ruth into the courthouse and watched Mary and Penny conferring with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the counter . The South and its holy dead , she thought , and suddenly felt a stinging envy , recognized it , and looked for Jemma , who stood apart , outside the glass door and the metal detector , her arms crossed over her belly , and riding on top , clutched in both hands , her pocketbook . She looked like a woman waiting for the bus that would take her to church , her mind emptied of its dailiness , chores and lists and her family 's needs , purged even of bits and pieces of songs from the radio , waiting to be filled up by God . This was Wednesday of Holy Week-maybe that 's where everyone was , getting ready to kill Jesus and raise him up again . And it was real work-the costumes , the music , the outdoor altar for sunrise service , a baptismal font for the newly reborn . The Easter Bunny . Hiding all those eggs . Plans in the event of rain . So much mingling of the Christian and the pagan took time . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tug on her dress : She 'd caught the hem under her boot , and the skirt pulled away from the bodice at hip-level , right in front , revealing the stark white of her slip . Jemma saw and made a face , then pointed upstairs , to the ladies ' room . Louie made an exaggerated , comical pout and mouthed Come with me , but Jemma said , " I ca n't . " She held up her pocketbook , probably offering needle and thread , but Louie shook her head and ran upstairs to survey the damage . It was an old dress ; other parts of the hem and waist had been held together with safety pins for months . If she moved the pins around , she could fix things so nobody would notice . <p> When she came down , everyone else was outside , and Penny called to her , " We found some of Jim King 's people ! We got directions . " " And you know what ? " Penny continued when everyone was safely stowed in Mary 's car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for family records ! " <p> " A Wilburn ? " Louie asked . <p> " The lover 's name was Wilburn . Nick Wilburn . He was the one that shot Jim King . " Penny was breathless . " This fellow 's brother was married to Jim King 's oldest daughter . Is n't that something , Jemma ? Everybody wanting to find their kin ! " <p> The delight in her voice made Louie look at Jemma , her own kin , and she thought of the man in New York City who did not and never would love her . She touched Jemma 's back , and it was all she could do not to say Hold me , Jem-even though Louie was the older sister-Take this cup from me , heal up my stupid , broken heart . " Davey King was bad to drink , " Mary said . <p> " Is this the same Davey King we knew ? " Penny asked . <p> " Maybe it 's his boy . Little Davey . " <p> " Well , if it is , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school with Sid . Do n't you remember him , Ruth ? " <p> " I think I do . I never heard he was kin to Sid . " <p> The house Mary pulled off in front of was a long rectangular box , like a trailer that had been redone in red brick . It sat perfectly alone on what must have been at least ten acres . A hill rolled away behind the house and up again to the west . On the far rise sat a much larger home , the Thomasons ' , Penny said , who raised horses . It reminded Louie of Virginia , and Thomas Jefferson 's house ; that the next town over from Gray , Georgia , was called Monticello gave her a queer kind of lost , drifty feeling . There were places , she knew , where the world folded back on itself , told the same story over again , and this was one of them . Somewhere behind the house , a dog began to bark crazily , strangling a little , as if it would risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property . <p> " I do n't know , Penny , " Ruth said suddenly . " What if they do n't want us here ? " <p> " Let me just go see . I 'll go . And if it 's all right , I 'll give you the sign " - she scooped her hand toward herself , beckoning- " and you all come on . " <p> Penny went , and they heard her call , say her name , then saw her open the screen door and slip inside . At that moment , a young man  --  maybe a boy ; it was hard to tell-came around the side of the house and stood staring at them . He was dressed in a dark-blue , long-sleeved T-shirt and muddy jeans and wore a brace around his neck . Strawlike hair hung below his ears . <p> " Whiplash , " Ruth said . <p> " Looks like it , " Jemma said back . <p> The man had an air about him of danger and sadness both , the two properties canceling each other out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which had managed to stay stunningly white . <p> " It 's like his head came off , " Jemma said , her voice dreamy and slow , " like it 's just floating there . " <p> " This is making me nervous , " Ruth said to Mary . " Jemma 's got her baby to think about . " <p> " I 'm all right , " lemma said . " I 'm not afraid . Look . There 's Penny . She 's giving us the sign . " <p> They all got out of the car and walked to the house . The boy with the neck brace did n't move , and lemma made a trancelike loop away from the front path in order to pass near him . <p> " She wants to see if his head really has come off , " Louie whispered to Ruth , and they both stopped to watch . But when lemma got close , the boy reached out his hand to touch her belly , snarling , his head bobbing above the white collar . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't your house ! " and she sprang away from him as if she 'd been burned . She was breathless and pale when she got to the screen door , her arms crossed . <p> Penny stood just inside , holding the hand of an older woman like they were dear friends . " This is Dorothy Virgil , " she told them . " She knows just where Kate 's house used to be . She says you can just see the chimney that 's left . The road is next door to Mr. James Thomason 's house . And he 's kin to Jim King . He 's Mr. King 's sister 's son . " <p> " Turn right past the mailbox , " Dorothy Virgil said . She spoke with the last traces of an English accent , which made her sound important , reliable , the truest guide they 'd had . <p> " I remember it now , " Penny said . " We drove out there with Sid last year , Mary . We saw it . We saw the plum bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know , " Mary said . <p> " Oh , you do too . It 's inside a lot of woods , and the road is bad . " <p> " Bad to drive , " Louie said , because she liked that turn of phrase , but no one seemed to hear her . <p> " Mr. Thomason is in a nursing home , " Dorothy Virgil said , " but his second wife is there . Nina . " <p> " Nina ? " Penny asked . " Who 's she kin to ? " <p> " Nobody , " Dorothy Virgil said . " She 's from New York . " <p> At the Thomasons ' , Penny told them " Remember what to do , " and then it was just the same : The four women watched while Penny introduced herself and then disappeared into the house . Three minutes later she was back outside , rowing them in with both arms , calling , " Come on , y'all . " <p> Nina Thomason was a gracious , pleasant woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , girlish voice that seemed at odds with the slowness of her speech . Her hair was dyed a chestnut-brown that made her look younger . She appeared to be profoundly elated about something that could not possibly have been her unexpected company . <p> " I just got in , " she said . " I tried to go see Mr. Thomason at the nursing home , but there 's some flooding up near Macon , and I could n't get through . " She laughed , and Louie saw that her breathless elation was relief . She had no desire to see Mr. Thomason . He was ninety-six , she said . <p> So she was the younger , rich almost-widow . She could n't wait . She was counting the hours . <p> " He collected clocks , " Nina Thomason was saying . " There 's over a hundred clocks in this house . " <p> They all stopped to listen . Sure enough , the house fluttered with ticking . Tick , tick , tick , irregular , so many at once that they sounded like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least fifty clocks in that one room , most of them running , all-at least that she could seetelling the wrong time . <p> " We want to know about Kate 's children , " Penny said , and just as she spoke the last syllable Louie heard a clock go off , cuckoo , cuckoo , in the next room . No one else seemed to notice , let alone assign it any meaning . You must get used to this , Louie thought , so that it does n't register . It must happen all night long , too , getting into Nina Thomason 's dreams . <p> " Now , just last year , " Nina began slowly , closing her eyes to see the past more clearly , " a woman came up from Jacksonville . " Penny looked triumphant . She took Mary 's hand and gave it a squeeze , then did the same to Jemma and Louie . <p> " That 's where we think they might have gone , " Penny said . " The children . After their father was killed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor little orphans . " <p> " But , " Nina Thomason went on , " I do n't recall her name . " " Was it King ? " Mary said . " Or was she Nina Young ? " <p> At the sound of her own name , Nina Thomason look confused . " I do n't know , " she sighed sweetly , her laughter a trill running into a cuckoo , cuckoo , from the next room . " I ca n't recall . " <p> " But it was Jacksonville , was n't it ? " Penny asked . <p> " I believe so . But you know , my daughter will remember . She lives in Spartanburg now , but you can speak with her when she comes for the summer . " <p> " Yes , we will , " Penny said . Louie could see she was disappointed , though not crushed . <p> " But since you 're here . . . " Nina Thomason smiled brightly . " . . . would you like to see my dolls ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It had been a long day , a lot of driving , and still they had to make the rainy trip back to Atlanta . Louie would offer to drive , but she knew Jemma would n't let her , believing she 'd fallen too far out of the habit in New York . Fallen out of the habit . She held her hand to her mouth , and tears filled her eyes . It 's not a joke , Louie told herself , though she had long believed God had a sense of humor , that His creatures amused Him , even when they made hideous mistakes . He understood what was going on even when they did n't . Once during the year she knew him , her minister had quoted C. S. Lewis : Imagine yourself a living house . God comes in to rebuild that house . At first , perhaps , you understand what he is doing ... getting the drains right and stopping leaks in the roof . But soon he starts knocking the house about in a way that hurts and does not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to ? The explanation is that he is building quite a different house from the one you thought of . . . . He is building a palace . He intends to come and live in it himself . He had looked at her in the mirror-he was adjusting the white collar he always wore , even when they met secretly . He was trying to explain her life , and Louie wanted to find that consoling , but she could n't . They were just words , nothing to hold on to-thin air , empty as a promise . As a vow . <p> She followed the other women to see Nina Thomason 's handiwork . In a way , the dolls were the most frightening thing they 'd seen all day , even more garish and alarming than Jim King 's broken grave , and Louie again had the sense that no pregnant woman should look upon them . They seemed dead , lying in rows against the pillows in each of the four bedrooms , dressed as brides , as babies , as Bo-Peeps and Red Riding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her baby in her arms . Louie could see dust on their faces , and she imagined the cloud of it rising slightly and settling back down as Nina Thomason closed each bedroom door behind them . There were no clocks in these rooms , Louie noticed , and the silence was terrible . She knew that soon Jemma would stand just outside a bedroom door , listening for breath , waiting , watching the baby 's eyes flutter closed . <p> The road was exactly what Dorothy Virgil described and Penny remembered , almost like a secret passage into the trees , even though the first quarter-mile was paved . It wound through the woods , circuitous , uphill and down , following no logical path , thickets of pine , sycamore , and just-blooming dogwood stretching endlessly on both sides . All five women peered anxiously left and right , looking for any sign of previous habitation , but there was none . After another quarter-mile , the road turned to gravel and then narrowed to less than one lane over a creek swollen and roiling from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be a wildfowl preservation area . <p> " He 'd gone out to shoot partridge when Nick Wilburn got him with his own gun , " Mary said slowly , a strange happiness in her voice . " It happened somewhere along here . " <p> " Look , there 's the plum bushes we talked about ! My goodness . That 's close to the road for trysting , " said Penny . <p> Louie stared into the woods on the downhill side , imagining the trees churning with men and dogs searching for Jim King and his killer . The rain and wind caused the new green leaves to quiver and make a kind of mist or fog , a ghostly thickening of the air . Louie half-expected the entire drama of Jemma 's in-laws to take place before their eyes . Mary drove on , the big car lurching through gullies in the road , rising and falling like a ship at sea . Jemma put her head back and held tightly to her door 's armrest . Every hard jolt shook a little groan out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I believe we 're going to induce labor if we go any farther . " <p> " It 's just a little ways on . I know it is . Go slow , Mary . Do n't bottom out so much . " <p> " Do you want to drive ? " Mary 's tone was even as always . She took off her dark glasses and put them on again . Louie did n't know how she could see anything in this light , how any of them could . <p> Ruth began to talk , then , oddly , disconnected as in sleep , telling a story about Sid Jr. , though Louie soon realized it was actually about Ruth as a young mother . " I remember the strangest feelings would wash over me , like a bath , like a big wave in the ocean , feelings I never had before . I loved that baby . " She laughed then , a merciless Ha . " You think you know something about that when you get married . You have your husband , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised , and she could see by the way Jemma held her head up and still that she was , too , shocked even , to hear her dignified mother-in-law speaking this way . " But then you see that little baby , and you say to yourself , Lordy , was I wrong . ' And the other thing was killing . You would kill for that baby . Any hour of any day . You would . " She held up her thumb and index finger to make a gun . " Bang . " <p> " I wonder what happened to all those King babies , " Mary said then . " Five of them . Just disappeared off the face of the earth . " <p> " Tired , Jemma ? " Louie leaned forward to pat her sister on the shoulder . <p> " Getting there , " Jemma said . But she did not take her eyes ofF the scenery . The late-afternoon light canted in at them from somewhere back beyond all the trees , from a distant country , undiscovered . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , desperately , as if she were out alone in these woods , in the rain , calling , Jemma , Jemma , where is it ? searching for the remains of their childhood home . <p> All at once there was a little cry , an explosion of air as Penny clapped both her hands over her mouth . Her face turned bright red , and she squeezed her eyes shut . " Mary , " she whispered , stagy , mock  --  horrified , " you better stop and turn around . It 's not this road . I just remembered . The road we want is in Round Oak . " <p> This is the place , Louie thought , where the cat , Pity Sing , would leap out of the basket , and Mary would wreck the car , Jemma would go into labor , and a murderous cretin would appear to kill them all . But none of that happened . Instead , Mary found a safe place in the road , nosed her car through a perfect three-point turn , and carried them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outside Macon , she removed her sunglasses and glanced in the rearview mirror , straight at Louie , who saw the puckered scar under Mary 's right eye . Louie remembered the story , how Mary had caught her husband with another woman and he 'd come at her , right up out of their bed , with a knife , hollering that he 'd fix her so she 'd never spy on him again in this world . <p> The drive back to Atlanta would be long-the rain had caused a forty-car pileup on I-75 just south of the city , with smaller wrecks starting fifteen miles north of Macon . Jemma did n't want to bet any of it would be cleared away by the time they got there , so they started north on Highway 41 , running parallel to the interstate . <p> " I do n't know what it is about weather , " she said . " People ca n't adjust . It 's the same thing with snow . Not that we get much , but you see it in people 's faces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skid on this stuff , so I might as well do it now and get it over with . " <p> Louie remembered that kind of recklessness : 1 know I 'm going to break my vows-poverty , chastity , obedience . What her married man said : 1 know we 're going to get caught , so 1 might as well tell my wife . She shook her head , made a shuddery noise in the back of her throat . <p> " What ? " Jemma said . <p> " Whatever happened with Mary and her husband ? " <p> " Well , they got divorced . He married the woman she caught him with . And you know what ? He killed her a few years later . Shot her . He 's in jail somewhere , I guess . " <p> " Can she see out of that eye ? " <p> " Pretty well . She was driving OK . She told Sid once that she sees stars at the bottom of her vision when she 's tired . Kind of funny , stars at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sunglasses on for her ? " <p> " I did . It 's nice of them . " <p> They drove in silence for some minutes . Highway 41 felt like an exhalation of breath after traveling through the woods in search of Jim King 's place . Louie looked across at Jemma and laughed . <p> " I was born in the backseat of a Mazda truck , rolling down Highway 41 , " she sang . <p> " Do n't even joke like that , Lou . Anyway , there is no backseat . " " You could do it , though . If you had to . " <p> " People can do a lot of things if they have to . " " So.what do you think I should do ? " " You ? Hire a hit man . Take the guy out of circulation . Eventually his wife would thank you . " <p> " When did you get so tough ? " <p> " About seven months ago , I think . " Jemma patted her belly , paused . <p> " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was really sad , Lou . That was the only house I ever knew . I could n't believe I was getting so sentimental over a damn house . I cried about it every day . And then I just told myself to stop . It was n't like somebody died . There are a lot more important things to think about . <p> " Then Sid and I had this stalker for a while . Out of nowhere . He 'd pull up to the house at all hours of the night and rev his engine . Sid tried to reason with him . I 'd wake up and hear these philosophical discussions about property and who owned the sidewalk . He 'd yell at Sid , You do n't own anything . There never should have been property . It throws everything off balance . ' " <p> " A guy you did n't even know ? " <p> " A perfect stranger . It scared us . So Sid bought me a little gun . I carry it all the time . " <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " I 'd be afraid . I 'm so afraid of everything these days . " <p> " You 'll be all right . You will . Hey , are you hungry ? You 've let yourself get so thin . Let me buy you a Quarter Pounder with cheese . Let me feed you , Lou . " <p> They stopped at a McDonald 's twenty miles from Gray and Round Oak and Monticello , parked close because the rain was still coming down in sheets , and went in the side door-Louie first , Jemma right behind her . When Louie came around the corner , she was facing the counter , about twenty feet back . There was something strange about the place ; the air seemed to have been sucked out of it , she thought later , or else it was as if the figure at the counter exerted a massive gravitational pull . It was a man , dressed all in black , standing with his back to Louie and Jemma , his legs spread apart . Louie saw his blond hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neck brace , the look of his head floating above his shoulders , and she recognized it all , but not in a way that made sense . The uniformed crew stood absolutely still , staring at him . He seemed to be speaking to them in a low voice . Louie heard a cash drawer click open . Then the man turned toward her , smiled , and slowly raised the gun to aim at her head . <p> " Bad luck , sister , " he said . <p> Then there were two explosions behind her , and the man was knocked backward onto the floor . Louie saw blood fly into the air and across the face of a woman employee , who screamed and dropped out of sight . Louie turned , and there was Jemma , her pocketbook spilled onto the floor , the small black handgun on top , where she had let it fall . Louie began to cry her sister 's name , over and over , until Jemma stepped closer and put her finger to Louie 's lips . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just slightly , so she could walk past her to the man on the floor . She bent to look , and the man moaned ; then she dropped to her knees and lowered herself awkwardly so that she was sitting sideways next to him . She lifted the man 's head and held it . When Louie got close enough , she could see he was n't a man at all , but a boy , probably no more than seventeen . There was a wound in his chest-near his heart ; Louie thought , because the blood pulsed out regularly through his shirt . Jemma 's belly was covered with blood , but still she held the boy and touched his hair . Her lips moved , and as she spoke , a piteous singing seemed to come from the boy 's throat , and then he was silent . Jemma was saying , " My baby , my child , " and Louie did not know which one she meant , the one in this world or the one still outside it , but then Jemma fell silent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louie noticed that the boy was also bleeding from the throat , just above the stark white of his neck brace , which had been pushed down into his shirt so that it resembled a clerical collar . What Louie saw before her was the ancient scene , Pieta , mother and wounded , dying child , the very picture of her faith and also its undoing , and she understood and was consoled . <p>
