<p> When he was a young man , John Dean writes , the GOP was led by conservatives of unassailable integrity , such as his political hero , the late Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater . But today 's GOP leaders , says Dean in this essay based on his new book Conservatives Without Conscience , twist the truth and howl like a lynch mob . Dean was White House counsel for President Richard M. Nixon . <p> Idiscovered Sen. Barry Goldwater 's political thinking during my college years , when , like countless other college students of the early 1960s , I read his book The Conscience of a Conservative and experienced a political awakening . The senator made conservatism respectable , unlike the witch-hunting Sen. Joe McCarthy and the screwball absurdities of the John Birch Society . Sen. Goldwater 's conservatism was sensible and straightforward , and therefore appealing . Given the influence he had on my thinking , as well as my admiration for him , it is not surprising that I still consider myself to be a " Goldwater conservative " on many issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not changed significantly in the past 40 years , the Grand Old Party to which I once belonged has moved so far to the right that on the contemporary political spectrum I now often fall to the left of the Republican center . <p> It was not Sen. Goldwater 's politics , however , that prompted me to call him after the 1994 midterm elections , when the Republicans won control of Congress for the first time in 40 years . I called to solicit his thoughts and to talk to him about the conservatives who were so aggressively promoting , and buying into , false history . " Conservatives seek the wisdom of the past , not the worst of it , " Goldwater snapped . " I was talking with former Arizona Republican congressman Johnny Rhodes , just a few days ago . He 's still got the ear of the House Republican leaders . I asked him to tell those fellows back in Washington that I do n't go along with their incivility . I told them they should back off on their attacks on Hillary Clinton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If they do n't , I 'm going to blast them . They 're driving decent people out of public service . And they 're turning off voters . It 's dirty politics , and it should end . " <p> My conversations with Sen. Goldwater evolved into a plan to write a book together about so-called social conservatives . We would attempt to understand their strident and intolerant politics by talking with people like Chuck Colson , Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell . We would learn more about their thinking , and try to determine whether they appreciated what they were doing to conservatism and to Republican politics . We would title our book Conservatives Without Conscience , an obvious allusion to Sen. Goldwater 's classic . But we had not progressed very deeply into our work before I realized it could become a burden for the senator , whose physical health was rapidly failing . I slowed the project down and soon had to place it on the shelf , hoping to resume when the senator felt better . Sadly , that did not happen , but because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wanted to understand why these so-called conservatives acted in such a conspicuously unattractive manner . What caused their aggression and the hostility that was changing the nature of politics ? The serious deterioration and disintegration of conservative principles under President Bush and Vice President Cheney , in all branches of the federal government , with the striking shift toward a very un-American type of authoritarianism , compelled me to complete the project I had begun with Sen. Goldwater . <p> Frankly , when I started writing this book I had a difficult time accounting for what had become of conservatism or , for that matter , the Republican Party . I went down a number of dead-end streets looking for answers before finally discovering a true explanation . My finding , simply stated , is the growing presence of conservative authoritarianism . Conservatism has noticeably evolved from its so-called modern phase ( 1950 to 1994 ) into what might be called a postmodern period ( 1994 to the present ) , and in doing so it has regressed to its earliest authoritarian roots . Authoritarianism is not well understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , yet it now constitutes the prevailing thinking and behavior among conservatives . Regrettably , empirical studies reveal , however , that authoritarians are frequently enemies of freedom , antidemocratic , antiequality , highly prejudiced , mean-spirited , power hungry , Machiavellian and amoral . They are also often conservatives without conscience who are capable of plunging this nation into disasters the likes of which we have never known . <p> Conservatives without conscience do not have horns and tails ; if they did they would be easier to identify . Many of them can be quite pleasant , but at heart they are tough , cold-blooded , ruthless authoritarians . They are limited in their ability to see the world from any point of view other than their own , and they are narrow in their outlook . George W. Bush and Dick Cheney are prototypical conservative leaders without conscience . The excessive and authoritarian-style secrecy of the Bush administration , in particular , was apparent even before the 9/11 terrorist attacks , but because the mainstream media ignored this issue , I wrote about it myself in Worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Unlike the consequences of Nixon 's secrecy , those of Bush and Cheney have been lethal . Realizing that only a partisan would remain silent , I wanted to make people aware of what was happening , for I recognized that this was a dangerous presidency . In Worse Than Watergate , I did not analyze Bush and Cheney 's behavior , because I was not sure then what was driving them . However , after studying the matter , I believe that one can reasonably conclude that how they think , their policies and their style of governing are based to an alarming extent on their own authoritarian personalities , which tolerate no dissent , use dissembling as their standard modus operandi , and have pushed their governing authority beyond the law and the Constitution . <p> Conservatism is not inherently moralistic , negative , arrogant , condescending and self-righteous . Nor is it authoritarian . Yet all of these are adjectives that best describe the political outlook of contemporary conservatism . I make these observations not as an outsider , but as a conservative who is deeply troubled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been co-opted by authoritarians , a most dangerous type of political animal . <p> Social psychologists have spent sixty years studying authoritarianism . Since the " authoritarian type " was first introduced in 1950 , the question of the relationship of authoritarianism to ideology has been an ongoing investigation . Extensive research , and overwhelming evidence , shows " that authoritarianism is consistently associated with right-wing but not left-wing ideology . " What follows is a summary of types of traits typically found by social scientists in social dominators ( the authoritarians who are leaders ) and right-wing authoritarians ( those who are the followers )  --  based on extensive testing . Although these collations of characteristics of authoritarians are not attractive portraits , they are nonetheless traits that authoritarians themselves acknowledge . <p> SOCIAL DOMINATORS  --  LEADERS <p> - Typically men <p> - Dominating <p> - Opposes equality <p> - Desirous of personal power <p> - Amoral <p> - Intimidating and bullying <p> - Faintly hedonistic <p> - Vengeful <p> - Pitiless <p> - Exploitive <p> - Manipulative <p> - Dishonest <p> - Cheats to win <p> - Highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mean-spirited <p> - Militant <p> - Nationalistic <p> - Tells others what they want to hear <p> - Takes advantage of " suckers " <p> - Specializes in creating false images to sell self <p> - May or may not be religious <p> - Usually politically and economically conservative/Republican <p> Right-wing authoritarian  --  followers <p> - Men and women <p> - Submissive to authority <p> - Aggressive on behalf of authority <p> - Conventional <p> - Highly religious <p> - Moderate to little education <p> - Trust untrustworthy authorities <p> - Prejudiced ( particularly against homosexuals , women , and followers of religions other than their own ) <p> - Mean-spirited <p> - Narrow-minded <p> - Intolerant <p> - Bullying <p> - Zealous <p> - Dogmatic <p> - Uncritical toward chosen authority <p> - Hypocritical <p> - Inconsistent and contradictory <p> - Prone to panic easily <p> - Highly self-righteous <p> - Moralistic <p> - Strict disciplinarian <p> - Severely punitive <p> - Demands loyalty and returns it <p> - Little self-awareness <p> - Usually politically and economically conservative/Republican <p> As distasteful as these qualities may appear , for authoritarians they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While these traits may , or may not , be found in all persons who are social dominators or right-wing authoritarians , they are characteristics of those who test high . People who test low tend to have fewer of these traits , but it is not possible to say which ones they do possess . Although most authoritarians will deny they are such , often failing to recognize these qualities in themselves , low testers may , in fact , be justified in their denials . The good news is that when some high-testing right-wing authoritarians do become aware of their characteristics they actually do work to change their outlook and behavior . Social dominators , however , do not seem able to make such adjustments . Authoritarianism is not a pathology , nor is the term pejorative , for it is descriptive . <p> However one views authoritarians , their behavior is not without significance , for they have played a major role in developing the contemporary conservative movement , and now they are taking conservatism increasingly toward political authoritarianism . Many are appropriately described as conservatives without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad news . But there is some good news , because while authoritarians have little self-awareness , a few of them , when they learn the nature of their behavior , seek to change their ways . <p> Reprinted by arrangement with Viking , a member of Penguin Group ( USA ) Inc. , from Conservatives Without Conscience by John Dean .
