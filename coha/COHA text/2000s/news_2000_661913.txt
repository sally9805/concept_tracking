<p> Mike and Judy Tuchman , both federal employees from Fairfax , Va. , are nearing retirement and have taken to calling themselves " future Floridians . " And the recent mess with the presidential election has n't dampened their enthusiasm . <p> If anything , the couple now feel a sense of mission about their planned move . <p> " The state needs us , " said Mrs. Tuchman , festooned like her husband with enameled pins for trading at Disney 's EPCOT . " I 'm sorry . Perception is 90 percent , and the perception right now is this is a state of clowns . " <p> The theme parks do n't quite say that Florida wants to be all things to all people - just all things that are good . " The Sunshine State . " " America 's Sunporch . " " Where Summer Spends the Winter . " <p> But every so often , the veneer cracks , and the rest of the country sees beyond the neon and pastel and fiberglass facades to the Florida that 's just as flawed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does , it 's all the more shocking , says Miami historian and author Arva Moore Parks . <p> " When you build your image around being some kind of paradise ... paradise is not supposed to have any problems , " says Parks . <p> Still , as a state with 92 million citrus trees , Florida has become adept at making lemonade from its lemons . <p> " I remember when ( the television series ) ' Miami Vice ' came around ... and a lot of chamber of commerce types thought , ' Oh my God ! If we connect Miami with drugs , people are going to stay away , " ' says author and journalist John Rothchild . " And , in fact , it was the biggest boon for tourism we ever had . And , somehow , I think the Florida mayhem thing will make Florida even more of an attraction . " <p> " The rules are different here . " <p> -A short-lived slogan in Miami-Dade County . <p> Say what you will about Florida , the state continues to grow at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown despite the hurricanes and wildfires , the racial tensions of the 1980s and the tourist shootings of the early ' 90s , the ever-present drug problems . <p> But this year it out-Florida 'd itself : <p> First , the custody fight over Elian Gonzalez . <p> From its shipwreck start to its federal-raid ending , TV endlessly chronicled a new set of Florida characters and spotlighted divisions between Cuban exiles and Anglos , and within the Cuban-American community itself . Sipping thick , sweet coffee in Miami 's Domino Park , an exile will tell you with a straight face that he thinks Communist leader Fidel Castro calls the shots in Florida . <p> All-Elian-all-the-time gave way to The Election that Would Not Die . <p> Warring officials . Armies of lawyers . Twenty-five tantalizing electoral votes . <p> Florida 's elderly population , the largest in the nation at 18 percent , has always been the butt of jokes . But the election brought the derision to new heights , with images of Palm Beach retirees too addled to read their ballots or too feeble to punch all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're in the petri dish , under the microscope , " says Marilyn Roberts , an assistant dean and professor of political advertising at the University of Florida . <p> Political messes are nothing new to Florida . <p> Ballot fixing in Dade County helped hold up the 1876 presidential election for nearly a month . Two years ago , the courts overturned the Miami mayoral election because of widespread cheating . <p> " Florida 's No. 3 industry , behind tourism and skin cancer , is voter fraud , " satirist Dave Barry , a Miamian , joked in a recent column . <p> Rothchild says Florida has an uncanny ability to turn even a mundane event like an election into a soap opera . <p> " We had Elian . We had the Mariel boatlift ( the 1980 flotilla that flooded south Florida with thousands of Cuban refugees - some of them convicts ) . We even have O.J. Simpson living in the neighborhood ( Miami-Dade County ) , " he says . " It 's sort of business as usual as far as I 'm concerned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was purely a victim of circumstance in a very close national election . But he says the upheaval is somehow emblematic of the state . <p> " There 's always this kind of conniving underbelly to whatever happens down here , " he says . " That 's one of the things I love about living in Miami . There 's all this wonderful free entertainment every day . <p> " If you give up the idea of trying to reform anything , which I gave up a long time ago , then you can sort of sit back and enjoy the show . " <p> But some Floridians are getting tired of BEING the show . <p> " We 're from Florida ( do n't hold that against us ) " <p> - Sign held up by a couple in Rockefeller Center during a recent " Today " show broadcast . <p> Shirley Krueger left Minnesota for Florida more than 15 years ago . But lately , she 's found it more convenient to fall back on her northern roots . <p> " I do n't even admit I 'm even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm tired of the whole thing , " says the 54-year-old school secretary from Volusia County , focus of one of the election disputes . <p> " It makes us look kind of hokey , " grouses Ken Richards , a state employee from Tallahassee . " I think something of this magnitude , it 'll stick . " <p> As usual , columnist Barry goes further : " It would n't surprise me if , after this is all over , we get voted out of the union . " <p> Why not , says Jack " Santa Claus " James , over in the town of Christmas . <p> " If the rest of the United States do n't care about us , we 'll secede from the union , " he quipped during a break from answering letters from children . <p> James , 76 , who has been playing Santa for 32 years , worked the polls in his home county of Orange on Election Day . He made his voter lists and checked them twice , and he can tell you why things did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ones in Palm Beach that could n't read and understand how to vote are Yankees , " he says . " Damn Yankees . " <p> Shrimper Dwight David Bates of Port Canaveral agrees . <p> " The counties in south Florida I do n't think are a true representation of Florida , " he says as he supervises the mending of nets on the deck of the Capt . Walter B. <p> A Tennessee native who made Florida home in 1981 , he adds defiantly : " I 'm not embarrassed to tell anybody I live here . " <p> " How many are mad that Ponce de Leon even discovered Florida in the first place ? " <p> - " Tonight Show " host Jay Leno . <p> Tourism is a $47 billion-a-year industry in Florida , accounting for about 20 percent of the state 's economy . Last year , about 60 million people visited the state , which has more than 660 miles of beaches and six of the nation 's 10 largest theme parks . <p> People come to Florida " to visit , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state 's tourism marketing office . <p> All those newscasts ? Free advertising , he says . <p> " One certainly positive part of the whole thing has been when you see what appears to be unending television coverage of reporters in their shirt sleeves standing in the sunshine in front of palm trees when so many other parts of the country perhaps do n't have the same kind of nice weather , " he says . <p> Roberts , the advertising professor , expects some kind of spin control from the state to counteract the negative press : " Some public service announcements , some tourism messages . " <p> In the end , though , says Linda Hon , who teaches public relations at Florida , the image that attracts visitors to Florida is not elections . " Certainly the lines at Disney World would n't suggest that it 's having any effect , " she says . <p> Rothchild has even come up with a new slogan . <p> " Instead of , ' Come to Florida and get away from it all ' - ' Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' <p> " Flori-DUH ! " <p> - Bumper sticker making the rounds . <p> One Floridian for whom this snafu might be more difficult to wave off is Gov . Jeb Bush , who was supposed to deliver the state giftwrapped to his brother , George W. <p> On Nov. 30 , Jeb Bush came out of semi-hiding to watch the launch of the space shuttle Endeavour . He used the high-tech event to try to take some of the heat of the state 's low-tech election system . <p> " There 's a lot of attention on Florida over the last couple of weeks , " he said to laughs from controllers . " But I want to tell you that the best of Florida is right here . Not what is being depicted on television , but what just happened right now . " <p> A week later , Kenneth Reed parked himself in a lawn chair in Cape Canaveral 's Jetty Park for the launch of an Atlas rocket carrying a top-secret satellite . <p> " There 's nothing wrong with Florida , " said the retiree from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's not Florida . " <p> Al Burt , author and former Miami journalist , agrees . But if there 's one thing the state 's good at , he says , it 's recovering from a beating . <p> " That 's been the history here , " he says . " A hurricane rolls in , it calms down , and we start rebuilding . We 'll have to do that again this time . " <p> EDITOR 'S NOTE : Allen G.
