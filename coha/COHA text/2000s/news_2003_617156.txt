<p> Manchester , N.H.  --  It is the eve of his 60th birthday and John Kerry , decorated war hero , U.S. senator , candidate for president , is reflecting on what he says is one of his few regrets in life : his face . <p> " I wish I had less of a serious look , " Kerry says as his campaign bus , the Real Deal Express , rumbles through the snow-covered countryside of New Hampshire . " People see this face and they think I 'm serious all the time , that I never laugh . See ? " He presents his profile , sticking out his chin . <p> " Looks like the Old Man of the Mountain , does n't it ? " he says , laughing heartily . <p> Kerry is talking about the famous rock pile in New Hampshire that stood for centuries as a testament to the state 's flinty Yankee character and the resolve of its independent and serious-minded people  --  so much so , it was featured on the state 's commemorative quarter . <p> " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the darkened bus window next to him . " Looks like the Old Man of the Mountain . " Then he adds wryly , " Before it fell . " <p> " The Great Stone Face , " as Nathaniel Hawthorne once called the natural wonder , disappeared in a rock slide last spring . It had been a tourist attraction since 1850 , and restoration efforts are under way . <p> Likewise , efforts are under way to restore the Kerry presidential campaign to the front-runner status it enjoyed in the media earlier this year . With just over a month left before the 2004 presidential primary voting begins , Kerry has sunk from a comfortable polling lead to a double-digit deficit behind fellow New Englander Howard Dean . <p> But on this day of campaigning , Kerry is relaxed , reflective , confident , even a bit amused . His wife , Teresa Heinz Kerry , has joined him for the day , and he is clearly pleased to have her aboard . " She 'd make a great first lady , " he gushes at one point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was divorced , with two daughters . She was the widow of Sen. John Heinz ( R-Pa. ) , and heir to the Heinz food fortune . <p> It seems an improbable match , but among the " best days " of his life , Kerry recounts during the interview , was " falling in love and getting married , " surpassed only by " the days my daughters were born " and " the day I came home alive " from Vietnam . <p> Throughout this day of campaigning , Kerry has joked with supporters traveling on the Real Deal Express and others who have shown up at senior citizen centers and firehouses for his speeches and free chili . <p> He ends a bullhorn-powered speech with a faux college cheer : " Go Wildcats . " He points out the chili stains on his shirt and says , " I 'll get it right eventually . " <p> " I 'm turning 60 , and if you ca n't laugh at yourself by the time you are 60 , you are in trouble , " Kerry says later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've learned in life . " <p> Anti-war leader <p> The quick-to-quip candidate is a far cry from the Kerry who made his public debut in the spring of 1971 . <p> Then he was one of the most serious-minded 27-year-olds in America  --  an embittered Vietnam veteran with three Purple Hearts , a Bronze Star and a Silver Star who had organized a huge anti-war march on Washington . <p> In an impassioned speech to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , he asked the question that hastened the end of the conflict in Vietnam and earned him a place on President Richard Nixon 's enemies list : " How do you ask a man to be the last man to die for a mistake ? " <p> His celebrity led to a profile on the CBS-TV program " 60 Minutes " in which he was asked for the first time whether he wanted to be president of the United States . " No , " he replied with a chuckle . <p> One of his favorite mementos of those days is a photograph of him with ex-Beatle John Lennon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Capitol Hill . Lennon had asked Kerry to introduce him to the crowd . <p> " It was a thrill , hanging with John Lennon , " Kerry recalled . " It seems so long ago . We chatted about where his head was at , about the war and how to end the thing . He was kind of wry , a quick sense of humor , very observant , a little shy , at least there and then . It 's one of my favorite photographs , because it caught a moment , an honest , innocent moment . " <p> Kerry was , in many ways , an unlikely person to carry forward the anti-war message . Not only had he been decorated for heroism , but he was an Ivy Leaguer , a graduate of Yale , with deep establishment roots : His mother , Rosemary Forbes Kerry , was descended from John Winthrop , who helped settle Boston in 1630 . <p> That , though , was the start of the long public career that has led Kerry to his campaign for the 2004 Democratic presidential @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed congressional campaign in his home state , Massachusetts , followed by a stint as a prosecutor , election to the lieutenant governorship in 1982 , election to the U.S. Senate in 1984 and re-election in 1990 , 1996 and 2002  --  the last time without GOP opposition . <p> The Kennedy effect <p> He was destined for a public service career , he believes , long before he became a Nixon era celebrity , largely through the influence of his parents and his first political hero , John F. Kennedy . <p> His father , Richard , volunteered as a pilot in the Army Air Corps in World War II and later became an American diplomat in Europe , where Kerry spent part of his childhood . His mother was a born organizer , serving 50 years as a Girl Scout leader , joining a health planning board and promoting recycling when " ecology " was still a radical word . <p> " My parents introduced me to a very big world with some big ethics and values , " Kerry says . " They cared about making the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that obviously had an influence on me volunteering for Vietnam . And my mother gave me a larger sense of global responsibility and involvement . " <p> But it was Kennedy and his New Frontier that ultimately moved Kerry toward politics . " I was attracted to the excitement of his challenge to us to pursue our ideals , " Kerry says . <p> Kerry detractors have long suggested that the first JFK  --  Bostonian , Catholic , naval war hero and politician  --  was more than an inspiration for John Forbes Kerry  --  Bostonian , Catholic , naval war hero and politician . Kerry even affected the Kennedy accent in his younger days , they say , and until recently , let everyone assume , incorrectly , that he was of Irish descent . <p> Kerry says his greatest admiration now , though , is reserved for the men who made up his crews on the two patrol boats he captained on counterinsurgency missions in the Mekong Delta . " The guys on my crew , they are the best , " he says . " They are steady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't have any doubt about it . " <p> The feeling is mutual . <p> " He 's one of those you 'd follow anywhere , " says former crewman Drew Whitlow of Huntsville , Ark . <p> Kerry 's wartime experience is central to understanding him , perhaps even the key to determining what kind of president he would be . But Vietnam " does n't run me , " he emphasizes . " You have to move on , and I moved on long ago . But the lessons are valuable . And they extend to other things in life . Being there for people when they are in need is the most important thing you can do . " <p> During his congressional career , Kerry has taken a special interest in veterans ' issues , such as compensation for those affected by Agent Orange . He also led the Senate investigation in the 1990s to determine whether any POWs or MIAs were still alive in Vietnam . And he spearheaded efforts on behalf of the Clinton administration that led to the normalization of diplomatic relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Capitol Hill in the shadow of Massachusetts ' senior senator , Ted Kennedy . But with Kennedy focusing on such domestic issues as health and education , Kerry has been free to build up foreign and defense policy credentials that some experts believe are sorely lacking in the Democratic Party today . <p> " I subscribe to the quaint notion that when somebody runs for the president of the United States , they ought to be qualified for the job , " former Sen. Gary Hart of Colorado recently told reporters during a conference call arranged by the Kerry campaign . " John Kerry has all the qualifications , foreign and domestic . " <p> " Nuanced " or " squishy " ? <p> Kerry 's war experience and foreign policy expertise , combined with a liberal voting record on most economic and cultural issues , was supposed to be a winning combination as he sought the Democratic presidential nomination . But his vote in favor of the war against Iraq and his subsequent criticism of the president 's handling of the war has enhanced Kerry 's reputation for being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways . <p> His recent use of a profanity in a Rolling Stone magazine interview to describe President Bush 's handling of Iraq struck some as a desperate attempt to cast himself as a hard-line war opponent . Kerry 's campaign has refused a White House request for an apology . <p> Allies defend his stand on Iraq as " nuanced . " <p> " He 's very complex , " says former Sen. Max Cleland of Georgia , a Vietnam veteran who is promoting Kerry 's candidacy . " The issues are complex . The world 's not black and white , and he knows that . " <p> It 's not the first time Kerry has seemed to switch positions . Early in his career , when he followed his unsuccessful House run as a liberal by becoming a law-and-order prosecutor , many of his earlier supporters were confused . Kerry now cites the experience to show he is n't a dogmatic member of the left . <p> Democratic voters , however , appear unwilling to embrace his shades of gray . Polls show Dean , an opponent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ among voters who have expressed a preference . <p> But Bill Shaheen , a former federal judge in New Hampshire who is one of the key activists in the Kerry campaign , is unconcerned . <p> " The leader in this race right now is not Howard Dean , " Shaheen says . " The leader in this race right now is ' undecided . ' " <p> His argument is that in the coming weeks , the undecided voters will choose Kerry , an argument Kerry also makes between campaign stops in the December darkness . <p> " This is a critical time for the country , " Kerry says . " The stakes are just enormous . We need a president , frankly , who has the kind of experience that I 've had : of being in a war , understanding its downsides but understanding the nature of threats in the world . " <p> Even so , Kerry considers himself " just a regular guy " in a lot of ways . He rides motorcycles and windsurfs , not for the thrill of speed , but for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and connected to the world around you . " <p> And playing the guitar , his newest hobby , is " just a relaxation , putting your head somewhere else , a complete diversion . You 're not thinking about anything else but hitting the right notes . " <p> Not that he has trouble relaxing . <p> " I can veg in 10 seconds , " he says . " I can lay on the couch and watch football games all day  --  give me some good guacamole and a beer , and I can crash a whole Sunday afternoon . I do n't get enough time to do it right now , of course , but boy , can I veg . I can sit there and do nothing for quite a while and be very happy .
