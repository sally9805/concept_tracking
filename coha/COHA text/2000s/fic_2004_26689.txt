Chapter One Abandon Remember , I told myself only minutes before we discovered the body , this was supposed to be fun . I had thought I would enjoy carrying a heavy pack up fifteen thousand vertical feet of uneven stony trail . Now I was too miserable to laugh at my own idiocy . Every step prompted a jolt of pain from the infected blisters on both heels , and my brittle knees ached and popped like a sputtering motor . My pack straps had carved a pair of red furrows into my back , each one filigreed by an itchy fungal infection . I had a nagging headache , shortness of breath , and nausea , a textbook case of low-grade altitude sickness . But what really made the whole situation unbearable was my traveling companion 's attitude . " Is n't it fantastic ? " Gavin said , as I trudged behind him . " It 's just extraordinary . I 've been looking at it for three days now and I never get bored of it . " The it in question was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that surrounded us , and even in my irritable state I could n't argue with his superlatives . Every time I looked around I felt like I had stepped into a fairy tale . But I would have preferred to appreciate its grandeur from the window of our lodge , preferably while eating momos and drinking an entire pot of lemon tea , rather than following Gavin to inspect the abandoned village . He had browbeaten me into coming with him , knowing that I did n't have the mental strength to argue . Probably thinking that I would thank him later . I 'll thank him with a two-by-four , I thought . I 'll show him my gratitude with a ball-peen hammer . Even without my pack , which I had left back at the lodge , each motion felt like a sacrifice . Step , breathe , step , breathe , stop , breathe , repeat . " Acute mountain sickness , my foot , " Gavin said . " I feel fantastic . I 've never felt better in my life . I think I 'm suffering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , " I muttered . " Paul ! Is that snow ? " I looked up from my feet . Gavin pointed excitedly at the shadow cast by a tall boulder , where a thin layer of the morning 's frost had not yet thawed . He was from South Africa , and never in his well-traveled life had he seen snow up close . I was originally from Canada and found the idea of a snowless existence nearly incomprehensible . " No , " I said . " Sorry . Just frost . " " Oh . Pity . " We moved on . The abandoned village was located on a ridge that jutted out above the Marsyangdi river valley like a peninsula . A few dozen low , small buildings of dark roughhewn stones welded together by frozen mud . It seemed insane to me that people had lived up here . It seemed insane that anyone had ever even considered living up here . Not even the yaks came this high . Nothing grew but lichen , a few particularly stubborn strands of grass , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceaselessly , numbing my exposed skin , and even with the sun at its midpoint I could still see my breath . And the effort required to quarry those hundred-pound stones , probably from the Marsyangdi riverbed far below , and bring them up to this godforsaken overlook  --  mad , I thought , absolutely barking , as the Brits on the truck used to say . Gavin hemmed and hawed over one of the buildings , inspecting its joints and shining his Maglite flashlight inside , while I stood behind and tried to catch my breath . I had been trying all day , and I was beginning to fear that it had gone for good . " Imagine being born here , " he said , and I tried but failed . Some cultural gaps are simply too wide to jump . He led the way through the village . We must have gone right past the body without noticing it . For a little while we stood on the edge of the cliff , which dropped a hundred sheer feet before easing off a little and tumbling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now we were accustomed to precipices . I had lost track of how many times during the previous week I had scrambled across steep drops on narrow and treacherous trails . Eventually I grew bored of contemplating my own mortality and turned around , intending to return to our lodge . Then I saw him . A fellow backpacker , sitting with his back against one of the village buildings , facing us . Even from a hundred feet away and with the cold , dusty wind in my eyes I could tell there was something badly wrong with his face . " Whoa , " I said , and narrowly prevented myself from taking a fatal step backward in surprise . " What the hell ? " Gavin turned to look , and said , " Fucking hell . " We advanced without really thinking about it . About halfway there I realized that the man was dead . Not just dead . Killed . Unless he had thrust a pair of matching Swiss Army knives into his own eyes . The red handles protruded from his eye sockets like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midtwenties , typical backpacker , wearing a blue jacket over a thick green sweater , jeans , and battered hiking boots . There was n't much blood , but I could smell it in the air like iron . Most of it was pooled on top of his head , dark brown muck filling a dent so large and misshapen that his thick dark hair did not conceal it . The liquid congealed on his cheeks was pale , almost transparent . Gavin muttered something astonished in Afrikaans . I looked around . Nobody there but the two of us and the cold wind and the mountains . We could see the trekking trail about half a mile away , and the two Gunsang lodges facing one another across it , but they seemed as deserted as this long-abandoned village . I felt newly vibrant , energetic , ready for action . The sight of the dead man had cued adrenaline to wash through me like some kind of mythical cure-all ... Continues ...                  @ @ @
