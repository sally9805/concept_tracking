<p> Daisy Davidow promised her son two things before he left  --  that she would n't worry or call to check in . <p> OK , so maybe she lied about the worrying part . <p> Her 15-year-old son is touring Italy this week with his class at Notre Dame Academy in Duluth . The eighth-graders , who left during the weekend , are doing research for a report on Rome . <p> And Davidow is a little on edge . <p> " I 'm a little concerned only because of terrorism , " she said . And then there is Billy 's age . " I would have felt more comfortable if he did this trip in high school rather than in eighth grade , but the kids won me over . It comes to the point you have to trust them ... and the school . " <p> Over the next three months , thousands of metro Atlanta moms and dads will be temporarily signing away their parental obligation to supervise their children so that schools can take their kids away on class trips . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids , it can be like slow torture for parents . The worry , the wait , the lack of control over what happens off their watch . <p> Whether the trip is just a break from the institutional walls of a classroom or part of the school curriculum , parents have the same basic concern : Just how safe is my child going to be ? The answer to that question can determine whether a kid stays home or goes along for the ride . <p> A new focus on security and new technologies are both changing the way class trips operate . Administrators rent satellite cellphones . They hire security guards . They blog and post digital photos . <p> Twice a day , Julie Derucki , assistant principal of Notre Dame Academy , will use her Blackberry to send updates to parents from Italy . She will be their eyes and ears . <p> To travel with Derucki , eighth-graders have to be equally prepared . They must carry international travel essentials  --  phone cards , extra copies of their birth certificates and passports should they misplace them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get separated from the group . Chaperones who accompany her undergo a criminal records check . <p> " This is not a vacation , this is work , " she tells parents . " My job does n't end until the plane touches the ground and my students have arrived safely back home . " <p> Cellphones , e-mail and Web sites give families a way to keep up with their traveling children in near real-time . <p> When Gillian Gansler 's daughter took a class trip to Israel last year with the Epstein School of Sandy Springs , e-mail helped bring reassurance the students were safe . <p> The class trip was carefully planned so the eighth-graders never took public transportation and only visited safe destinations . <p> The school posted a map and instant digital class photos on its Web page so students studying Israel  --  and worried parents  --  could follow the path of the class trip from home . <p> " They sent e-mails when they got there , they sent e-mails when they moved cities , " said Gansler , who works as a parent coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . " They were very good about communicating with us . " <p> Greater Atlanta Christian parents will be resting easy this week while the senior class travels to Orlando . They know school officials will be packing old technology  --  masking tape . <p> They do n't use it on the kids  --  it 's for hotel room doors at bed check time . <p> " You take a piece of masking tape and you stretch it between the door frame and the door , " explained Donna Strickland , who is traveling with more than 100 seniors from the Norcross private school to Universal Studios . " If the child was to open the door and go out of the room then that tape is going to be disturbed . " <p> For added precaution  --  and the benefit of parents  --  the school hires security guards , Strickland said . At night , chaperones rest and the trained policemen stand vigil over hallways . <p> " It 's a fun trip , " Strickland said , but kids must follow the rules . <p> What if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home , " Strickland says , " at the parents ' expense . " <p> In 20 years of organizing the trip , Strickland said she has only sent one student home . <p> Preparing for the worst is part of staying on top of things . Schools review emergency plans with parents before they allow their children to leave on class trips . And since the terrorists attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 , they also make it their business to check travel advisories . <p> Wesleyan School in Norcross canceled a trip to Venezuela one year after learning the State Department was recommending against travel there . <p> " We choose trips that are n't risky  --  driving on Interstate 285 presents a greater risk , " said Brad Mauldin , missions coordinator and history teacher at Wesleyan . <p> Even with all the precautions , the parents and students decide who goes on a trip and who does n't . Organizers say a class trip is a reward for a student , not a class requirement . It is a chance for them to taste freedom . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . <p> Daisy Davidow did n't travel abroad until she was in high school , but she says she 's confident her son Billy will return home safe  --  and wiser . <p> " It 's a valuable experience , " she said . " He 's getting to see the world is larger than Alpharetta . " <p> THE ABCs OF CLASS TRIPS <p> Before sending children away on a class trip , parenting experts at Parent Coach Company of Atlanta recommend these precautions : <p> * Determine if they are mature enough to handle an overnight class trip . Are they a discipline problem ? Have they been away from home overnight before ? Did they get homesick ? <p> * Decide whether the trip is necessary . Is it a fun trip with no real agenda or is it a trip with an itinerary that relates to their education ? The difference can help decide whether it is worth the money . <p> * Check the family budget . Is the trip affordable ? Is the school offering a payment plan that wo n't bust the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Make sure a child knows what to do if they lose their passport , identification or money . Planning ahead can help them handle a difficult situation without you . <p> * Get to know the chaperones . Find out who they are and get contact numbers for them . Make sure they have your contact information . <p> Source : Parent coaches Tracey Bankhead and Gillian Gansler of the Parent Coaching Company of Atlanta .
