Chapter One Anthony 1953 Elsewhere That winter of 1953 , stenciled glass-wax decorations appeared on nearly every window in the Bronx , and Uncle Malcolm was sent to jail for stealing stamps and office equipment from his last new job . My parents were so busy fretting over Aunt Floria - who looked like a widow because she was married to Uncle Malcolm - that they got impatient whenever I told them how much I wanted a stencil kit . " Not now , Anthony , " they 'd say , and they would n't even glance at the commercial of the girl and her mother who opened their kit , pulled out stencils of comets and bells and Christmas trees that were cut from thick transparent paper . While the mother held a stencil against the window , the girl soaked a sponge in pink glass wax , dabbed it against the stencil , and they both smiled at the comets and snowflakes they 'd created . " All the other kids got stencil kits , " I lied on the drive to Aunt Floria 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cautiously in the icy rain that pelted our Studebaker . " Floria is my sister , after all , " he said . My mother tapped one painted fingernail against the St. Christopher medal that was glued to the dashboard . " Maybe you need to figure out who the hell your real family is , Victor . " " And what is not real about my sister ? " " Do n't tempt me . Please . " " We already got glass wax for cleaning windows , " I reminded her as we passed beneath the Third Avenue El . " So we only need to buy a stencil kit . " " Quit skutching , Anthony . " " Kevin has a stencil kit . " " Kevin always has everything you 're trying to get . And when I check with Mustache Sheila , it 's not true . " My mother was always making up names that fit people just right , like the three Sheilas in our neighborhood , Pineapple Sheila , Bossy Sheila , and Mustache Sheila . Pineapple Sheila was Jewish ; Bossy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin O'Dea 's mother . " But all the kids have stencil kits . " " Basta ! You know I detest it when you skutch . It 's always the same . First you try getting what you want by being charming . Then you skutch . " I slid close to the wing window behind her , propped myself on the armrest to be tall . Inside my left mitten was Frogman , green and hard , and I curled my fingers around him . Frogman was a prize from a box of cereal I hated , but Kevin had finally traded Frogman for my two favorite baseball cards , Phil Rizzuto and Yogi Berra . Kevin lived in the building across from ours on Creston Avenue , next to the back wall of the Paradise , where movies were airconditioned and movie matrons shined their flashlights into your face if you talked . Summer evenings , when it was too hot and sticky to be anywhere else , our families would be at the Paradise , no matter what was playing as long as it was n't banned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie chart was tacked to the wall of the vestibule : A-1 was morally suitable for all audiences ; A-2 was morally suitable for all , with reservations ; B was partially condemned ; and C was condemned . Though we took pledges against condemned movies - not just to stay away from them , but also to boycott theaters that had shown them - Father Bonneducci still screamed from the pulpit that it was a mortal sin to see a condemned movie , and I could hear his voice inside my head whenever I passed the Ascot and tried not to glance at the posters of the condemned movies . Next door to the Ascot was a Hebrew school , and I wondered if the rabbi screamed at the boys about not looking at the posters . I liked the Swedish posters . Especially Summer with Monika . I wished we had enough money to go to the movies every day , but at least Kevin and I could stand in the polished recess by the ornate ticket booth of the Paradise and feel the cold air , and retell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Outer Space ; Invaders from Mars ; and , most of all , Beast from 20,000 Fathoms . We 'd roar like the beast - " uuuughhh " - as it burst from the ocean near Baffin Island with its huge lizard teeth and lizard arms - " uuuughhh " - getting ready to squash Wall Street and the Ferris wheel at Coney Island . One day the movie matron came out and yelled , " Scat , you noisy kids , or I 'll call your mother . " Some afternoons we 'd spread Kevin 's old quilt on his roof , and we 'd spy on communists who might walk down Creston Avenue . So far we had n't seen any , but we knew how to spot communists because they were mean and wore red uniforms . That 's why they were called reds . They carried Jell-O boxes so they could find each other and trade secrets about the bomb . While Kevin and I waited , we 'd read our Tarzan and Bugs Bunny comic books , or we 'd scrape with Popsicle sticks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heat . Some tar would get on our skin , our clothes , but we 'd pretend we were getting a tan at Orchard Beach , even though we could see the Empire State Building from up here . " I was talking about helping Floria too much while Malcolm is Elsewhere , " my mother was telling my father . Elsewhere meant anything from jail , to England , to being on the run . Elsewhere meant never staying in one place for long because you 're moving outside the law . My father stubbed out his cigarette . " And who decides what too much help is ? " " You think you 're just like Jesus walking on water . You think you can do anything without getting your feet wet . " " Feet ? Jesus ? " " Well , let me tell you that Jesus got his feet wet . Plenty wet . " Feet wet . Wet feet . Feet cold . Cold car . Our car was so freezing cold , I could barely smell the leftover trays of veal scaloppine and eggplant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the golden anniversary my father had catered , and he 'd covered them with white towels that had the name of his business , Festa Liguria , stamped on them . " What am I not understanding here about wet feet ? " he asked . " Forget it . " " No , no . Educate me . Me and the boy . We both may learn something from you that we 've missed at mass . " I stared past our Palisades Park decal at the White Castle , gray now in the rain , where the twelve-cent hamburgers were as thin as Uncle Malcolm 's playing cards ; and as I thought of him being Elsewhere again , I pictured him running , his lanky body tilted into the wind , one of his hands holding on to the green accordion he 's strapped to his chest , the other to his ginger-colored hat . " I find it enlightening , Leonora , how you only quote the Bible to point out my shortcomings . Somehow I doubt the Bible was written for that purpose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Malls , lit them both , and stuck one between my father 's lips . " It means ... whenever you help Floria , you deprive your own . " " And are you my own then ? " Though he grinned at her as if trying to joke her out of her mood , his voice was harsh . " Are you then , mia cara ? " She snatched a folded newspaper page from her purse . " If you 're like that , I 'll do my crossword puzzle . " She could n't sit still , my mother . Invariably , one crossed leg would bounce , or her hands would fidget for something to move . That 's why she was too skinny , Aunt Floria had said to my father at my seventh birthday party a few weeks ago . " I wonder if that 's why Leonora ca n't hold your babies . Thank God she carried Anthony almost full-term . " I 'd seen my mother hold plenty of babies and carry them around , but when I told Aunt Floria so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she yelled , " Dropping a double litter does not make you superior . " But Aunt Floria yelled right back . " My twins are not a litter . At least I 'm not starving my body to fit into a size six . " " That 's the truth , for sure . If you quit eating macaroni for a year , you would n't get down to a size sixteen . " My aunt reached back and turned her black collar inside out . " I want you to check this label . Fourteen , Leonora . And I did not sew this dress . I bought it at Alexander 's . Size - " Quickly , my father turned on WNEW . " Listen ... Frank Sinat - " " Size fourteen . See ? " " You just sewed in a smaller size tag . " " Alexander 's keeps getting bigger , " I said , " just like - " " Anthony - " My mother looked startled . " Do n't you - " " You told me Alexander 's keeps getting bigger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing like that , " my mother lied . " Floria - " But my aunt was running up the stairs of my grandparents ' house , and my mother was chasing after her . " Floria , please - " My grandfather reached into his pocket . " How about a peppermint , Antonio ? " Just like the nuns at school who could whisk holy cards and erasers from their sleeves , my grandfather could produce whatever I might need from his pockets : rubber bands , money for paper candy or Nik-L-Nips , cat's-eye marbles , a whistle , peppermints , kite string . As a boy in Italy , he 'd won a kite flying championship . Riptide Grandma complained that his pockets were always stretched out of shape , and the one thing he 'd get angry about was when she cleaned them out . I slipped his peppermint into my mouth . " The Alexander people keep knocking down apartment buildings to make their store even bigger . " " At home in Italy , people preserve old buildings instead of knocking them down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkey bars in the playground ? " " In St. James Park ? They 're not allowed to build there . " " Promise ? " I followed him into his music room below the stairs to the second floor . It smelled good in here from when it used to be a closet . On the floor lay wood specks that bugs had chewed from the beams . " Promise . That park belongs to the city . Which means it belongs to you . " " Really ? " " To you and every child who plays there . " The window to the alley was on one wall of the music room , and on the other walls my grandfather had mounted candle-shaped lamps from his job at the salvage yard and a small picture of himself as a boy with a kite . " I think it 's funny when Americans talk about their historical buildings . " He started cleaning a record with a folded undershirt . " Eighty years , Antonio ? A hundred ? Two hundred ? " Though he was a big man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if it had to fight its way out , and I was sure that 's why he loved opera so much , those big voices that came through the woven fabric in front of his golden-brown Victrola . " In Liguria , we talk about thousands of years . " His fingers curled a bit toward his palm , and he motioned with that hand as if asking me to come closer , to go way , way back with him , maybe a thousand years . " When I was a boy in Nozarego , a little younger than you , I helped my father in his vineyard that had belonged to his father and his father 's father and so on ... centuries of Amedeos , Antonio , before your time and mine . " " I almost got squashed at Alexander 's . " He sat down on the wider of the two chairs . " Oh Dio . How did that happen ? " Upstairs , my mother and aunt were screaming at each other like opera divas , even though my mother had told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always screaming , and it takes them half an hour to say , ' Come into my embrace , ' or to recognize a long-lost brother . Then they scream the same thing again , and you ca n't even understand the words . " My grandfather had listened closely , just as he always did , without rushing you , even though my mother went on and on , and when she 'd exhausted herself and said she admired drama that relied on the power of words , the power of silence , my grandfather had smiled and said , " I like silence , too . " I climbed on his knees . " The Alexander people had their birthday sale and Mama and I were waiting for the doors to open but firemen were guarding them and people started shoving and squashing me . " " How awful . " " Some people got pushed through the windows and cut and mannequins got knocked over and then I heard sirens . I do n't like Alexander 's . " He nodded . " Have you considered trading time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You could ask her if , for every ten minutes in Alexander 's , she 'll give you ten minutes in the toy department . " " And for every hour in Alexander 's I get one hour at the five and ten ? " " You could ask , Antonio . " " At Kress , not Woolworth , because it 's bigger and next to Gorman 's hot-dog stand . " For a while , the quarrel above us continued , but later that same evening , my mother and Aunt Floria danced to Make Believe Ballroom on WNEW , the way they liked to at family parties , my mother - despite high heels - not nearly as tall as my aunt , who had delicate ankles although the rest of her body was solid , like my father 's . By far the best dancers in the family , my mother and aunt took pleasure in each other 's grace and skill as they went spinning and dipping past us . And if there were words that passed between them , they must have been gentle . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoked and watched the women - including Riptide Grandma and Great-Aunt Camilla - do the rumba and the fox-trot and the tango . That evening , Uncle Malcolm was n't Elsewhere yet . Sweating and laughing , he accompanied the radio by pumping long , shimmering breaths from his accordion as though he were part of Count Basie 's orchestra . Uncle Malcolm was the only one in my family who was n't Italian , and he seemed exotic to me because of that . His pale hair was damp , and his eyes chased Aunt Floria , who became girlish and light as she danced with my mother . When my grandfather stepped next to Great-Aunt Camilla and whispered something in Italian , she laughed and , gently , pushed him away with her palm against his chest . " It 's true , " he said , " even if I were a woman , I 'd still rather touch women than men . " " That 's brave of you , Emilio . " He sat down on the couch . " You go , Antonio . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aunt Floria opened one side of their dance for me , and I rushed into the warm knot of their bodies , spinning with them . Spinning and dipping long after my father and Uncle Malcolm joined my grandfather on the couch , slumped toward him as if to make a triangle , and took the customary nap . Afterwards , in the kitchen , Aunt Floria and my mother washed the dishes and argued , but we were used to them being quick-tempered with each other and then confiding and dancing as if they were the closest of friends .
