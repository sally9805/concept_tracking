<p> When David Gockley made his first local appearance in February after being named the new general director of the San Francisco Opera , he showed up for a news conference at the War Memorial Opera House wearing a San Francisco Giants cap . It was a lark , an offhand joke  --  but it was also a compact little symbol of everything San Franciscans needed to know about the new guy in town . <p> First of all , the allusion to baseball was a reminder that Gockley  --  a lifelong sports aficionado  --  views opera as a populist form of entertainment , one that should be made available to the widest possible audience . The gesture was there to emphasize that a city 's cultural institutions are no less central to its identity than its athletic franchises . <p> By trumpeting his new loyalties , Gockley was also acknowledging the shock of seeing him anywhere but in Houston . No other opera administrator in the past quarter-century has been so closely identified with his company as Gockley has been with the Houston Grand Opera , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a minor provincial company into a national byword for innovation , artistic excellence and financial solidity . <p> Then too , the prankish aspect of the gesture , underscored by his boyish smirk as he took the podium , signaled Gockley 's willingness to shake things up in pursuit of a good time . No one who 's dealt with Gockley has ever doubted his seriousness or passion for opera , but they also testify to a childlike , silly streak that matches his physical presence . At 62 , he has the wide eyes and unblemished demeanor of a man half his age , and although his impish side is often kept under wraps , it 's not hard to glimpse the goofiness lurking just below the surface . <p> And finally , the baseball paraphernalia conjured up the image of an athlete just itching to get into the game . Renowned for his energy and all-encompassing grasp of every aspect of opera management , from commissioning to singing to fundraising to executive governance to video technology , Gockley seemed like a man who could n't wait to get started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'm ready to play . <p> Gockley officially took the reins of the San Francisco Opera at the beginning of the year , and the challenges he faces are by no means minor league . The company 's finances , though on the mend , remain worrisome ; the effects of consecutive multimillion-dollar deficits and an underfunded endowment are still being felt . The five-year tenure of his predecessor , Pamela Rosenberg , has been an invigorating but also polarizing chapter in the company 's history , and it remains to be seen what kind of detente can be forged between the admirers and detractors of her theatrically daring brand of operatic production . Competition for top singers is always fierce , and like all arts organizations , opera companies have to find a way to distinguish their product from the host of entertainment options vying for patrons ' dollars . <p> Yet if there is anyone on the contemporary opera scene equipped to handle these challenges , it is Gockley . With his dual training in music and finance , he harks back to such old-style impresarios as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bing , leaders who made it their business to oversee in detail the entire operation under their aegis . And he 's lost no time in familiarizing himself with the complex workings of a $50 million company . <p> During a recent conversation , Gockley tossed off an extensive list of projects that are already under way . He 's instituted a department-by-department review of the company , trying to ascertain which are operating at full speed and which need remedial work . He 's made it a priority to improve the company 's testy relations with the unions . He 's planning to reduce the number of empty seats at the War Memorial Opera House by offering more productions with fewer performances apiece . He continues his quixotic search for a smaller theater in San Francisco where more intimate or unusual productions can be staged . <p> Changes in programming are further down the road because of the long lead time involved in operatic planning . The coming season , 2006-07 , was designed by Rosenberg , and Gockley has left that mostly intact  --  the one prominent alteration being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lucia di Lammermoor " with a revival of Verdi 's " Rigoletto . " <p> Beyond that , Gockley promises a mix of " the slurpy traditional stuff and the ascetic new stuff . " That means lush , ultra-Romantic showpieces like Ponchielli 's " La Gioconda " and Giordano 's " Andrea Chenier " together with projects like the long-overdue San Francisco premiere of John Adams ' " Nixon in China "  --  which HGO premiered in 1987 . A controversial and expensive co-production with the English National Opera of Berlioz 's epic " Les Troyens " has been axed . Plans are afoot for a new production of Wagner 's " Ring " cycle , to be co-produced with the Washington Opera and unveiled here beginning in 2008 , and Gockley is feeling out composers such as Philip Glass , Mark Adamo ( " Little Women " ) and Stewart Wallace ( " Harvey Milk " ) for new commissions . <p> To converse with Gockley is to be kept perpetually off balance . He can unleash long and ostentatiously considered monologues while gazing off at the horizon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interlocutor with a gimlet stare and deliver a quip or a personal remark . <p> " He 's very enigmatic , " says conductor Patrick Summers , the former music director of the San Francisco Opera Center , who has worked closely with Gockley since becoming the Houston Grand Opera 's music director in 1998 . " Even with people who know him well , which I think I do , he 's always doing something unexpected . He does not do the normal and the expected thing . He ca n't . It 's not where he lives . <p> " Yet at the same time , he is enormously pragmatic and practical . He exists at the extremes of the spectrum and nowhere in the middle . He can be incredibly inspiring and visionary , and at the same time childlike and bawdy . You can not say you 've met anyone like David Gockley . " <p> Those closest to Gockley describe him as sentimental and easily moved  --  especially by a good operatic performance . His guarded manner , they say , serves to mask a fundamentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often puerile , and even the jokes offered publicly tend to be puckish and offbeat , and delivered with a bewildering deadpan . " He has so much going on in his brain that the humor comes out in unique ways , " says soprano Patricia Wise , the first of Gockley 's three ex-wives . " He 'll come out with these incredibly corny puns , or something that has this long , long , long thread where at the end people will either think , ' That guy 's weird ' or ' Damn , that 's funny . ' " <p> At times Gockley 's unpredictability can make him difficult to work for . " He 's a very mercurial personality , " says Houston Chronicle music critic Charles Ward . " Employees never know which David is going to walk in the door at any moment . Yet despite that , he engenders enormous commitment and loyalty in the people who work for him . " <p> One reason , his associates say , is the sense that self-aggrandizement is nowhere in Gockley 's list of priorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ classic music business , David has the least amount of personal ego , " Summers says . " But he does have an enormous ego investment in the company  --  first Houston , and now San Francisco . And people who have worked for him would do anything for him because they know he 's motivated by the right things . He 's not invested in constantly being right  --  he 's fabulous about acknowledging when he 's wrong  --  but in the company doing well . " <p> Composer Carlisle Floyd , a close friend for more than 30 years , remembers the time Gockley was named one of the Ten Outstanding Young Men of America by the Junior Chamber of Commerce . " His whole response was , ' I 'm very happy for the Houston Grand Opera . ' I said , ' David , for God 's sake , take the credit for yourself  --  you 've earned it . ' " <p> By all accounts , Gockley is a straight shooter , for better or worse . " You always know where you stand with David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Houston Grand Opera Studio before embarking on an international career . " It can be difficult and abrasive , but in the end you know exactly what the expectations are and what you need to do . " <p> " He has a charming mien much of the time , " says Ann Holmes , the former arts writer for the Houston Chronicle who covered Gockley 's career from the beginning . " But he also has a rough way of doing business sometimes , and he can hurt the feelings of people who are loyal supporters , either by seeming to ignore them or by not supporting their efforts . " <p> Stage director Francesca Zambello , who has worked with him frequently and also directed in San Francisco , says Gockley 's truthfulness and intimate involvement with the creative process have combined to make Houston a great place to work . <p> " A lot of what I consider my best work in the States has been done for him , " she says . " He knows how to manage , which means that when he says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' you know that 's true . At many companies people say you can have this or you can have that , and you know it 's never going to happen . <p> " He 's also a very hands-on producer . With a new piece , he often functions as a kind of dramaturg and he is able to articulate story ideas before they get to the composers . And in production , he often has very constructive notes , where he is pushing you to dig deeper  --  he 'll say , ' the narration is n't clear here ' or ' the audience wo n't get that . ' There 's a room in Houston I always called the ' No ' room , where we met after rehearsals to bat around ideas and get notes , and where David would say ' No ' to things . But I have often seen shows that were really good make the transition to great because of his intervention . " <p> In Houston , Gockley 's artistic vision was conjoined with a prodigious gift for fundraising . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an opera company is the difference between what it costs to do stuff and what you get out of the fare box , " says Mick Seidl , former president and chairman of the Houston Grand Opera board . " And taking someone out to dinner and explaining how he needs help is not something he finds onerous . " <p> Jim Ireland was the managing director at the Houston Grand Opera for 21 years , and saw Gockley in action . " He 's such a risk-taker , such an entrepreneur , " he says . " He had these wild-ass crazy ideas , and I 'd say , ' My God , how are we going to do that ? ' He 'd say , ' Well , tell me how much it 's going to cost , ' and then he 'd go out and find the money . He wanted to build a modular stage for outdoor performances , or put in surtitles , or have video screens hung in the hall where there were seats with obstructed views of the stage , and when David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happen . It 's much more exciting when you 're behind a speedboat than a canoe ; the ride is scary as hell , but that 's what art is all about . " <p> Gockley grew up in Wayne , Penn. , a middle-class Philadelphia suburb set amid the wealthier areas of the Main Line . His father , an athletic coach , inspired his love of sports ; from his mother , a trained pianist and organist who sold real estate , he inherited a passion for music . The family often sang together around the piano , a tradition he 's continued with his children . <p> " We loved the old standard songs and the show tunes , " he recalls . " We also used to watch ' The Voice of Firestone ' on television  --  that was when you could still get a sense of the classical singing voice in prime time . I remember watching Jan Peerce and Robert Merrill and Roberta Peters and Leonard Warren performing on a Sunday night . There was even an opera singer once in a while on Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choral singing and musicals through high school , and it was n't until he went to Brown as an engineering major that he began to think seriously about opera . The spur came from his professor , the conductor Erich Kunzel , who suggested that his voice might be suitable for opera . So Gockley  --  who had never heard an opera before  --  hightailed it to Boston for a performance of Offenbach 's " Tales of Hoffmann , " conducted by Sarah Caldwell with a cast led by Beverly Sills and Norman Treigle . Soon afterward he made his first visit to the Metropolitan Opera in New York , and he had caught the bug for good . He spent summers at Tanglewood and appeared in undergraduate productions of Stravinsky 's " The Rake 's Progress " and Kurt Weill 's " Threepenny Opera . " <p> After college , Gockley moved to New York to study , supporting himself as chorus director and head of music at a private school in Livingston , N.J. He spent three summers in the apprentice program at the Santa Fe Opera , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickly took off , with a contract at the New York City Opera , but Gockley struggled . Singing became increasingly difficult for him technically  --  he suspects now it had to do with gastric reflux , a condition about which little was known at the time  --  and one day his teacher , the famous pedagogue Margaret Harshaw , told him , " I think you need to take a break from this . Maybe a long break . " <p> " Whatever I was doing to try to get better vocally was working against me , " Gockley says . " Perhaps I was too analytical about it . I was forgetting the joy of singing and making music , and instead I was putting quarters on my tongue to keep my tongue down . It was like dissecting a butterfly and then trying to put it back together . <p> " When I finally put it behind me I felt a great relief , because I knew singing should be easier than that . I could remember when singing was not a chore but a joy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could just wake up in the morning and sing . I missed being able to do it really well and effortlessly and expressively , but I did not miss it being a trial . It 's hard when you have to admit that you ca n't do what you thought you were going to do  --  to tell people you 're not going to be a singer after you 've said you 're going to be a singer  --  but privately I was relieved , and ready to get on to the next thing . " <p> " David has this tremendous ability to reinvent himself , " Wise says . " When he felt this was n't working , he thought , ' I 'm going to move on , ' and he chose the right path . The career he chose and followed for all these years has put him on the map . He covered over the wound very quickly and just went on , which I think is very Protestant of him . " <p> Gockley decided to pursue a business degree , starting with night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies at Columbia as a finance major . But midway through the program , he felt the pull of the arts , and knew that he did n't want to go to work for Citibank or Scott Paper . So he switched his focus to nonprofit management and began sending his resume around to institutions on the East Coast . He worked briefly at Lincoln Center , but soon the call came from Houston with an offer to join the company as business manager . Gockley was 27 . <p> The 15-year-old Houston Grand Opera had been founded by Walter Herbert , a German-born conductor and impresario . Herbert arrived in the United States in 1938 and , after a brief stint producing operas in San Francisco , became the first general director of the New Orleans Opera in 1943 . By 1955 , says writer Ann Holmes , Houston " was a city of so much energy , with everything popping , and people could feel it in the air . And along came Walter Herbert and saw that this would be a great place for an opera company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first season of Strauss ' " Salome " and Puccini 's " Madama Butterfly " and a budget of $20,000 . By the time Gockley arrived on the scene , the company was staging five operas a season with a budget of more than $200,000 . Herbert , in the meantime , had gone on to found the San Diego Opera , and was dividing his time between the two cities . Gockley was brought in as heir apparent , and two years later , in 1972 , he became general director . <p> Gockley wasted no time in putting his stamp on the company by shaking up its reliance on traditional repertoire and straightforward productions . In his first season , he created an uproar by proposing a production of the Tim Rice-Andrew Lloyd Webber rock opera " Jesus Christ Superstar . " That one never came off , but in 1975 the company made history by giving the first staged production of Scott Joplin 's opera " Treemonisha , " a production that traveled to the Kennedy Center in Washington and then to Broadway . A year later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stage Gershwin 's " Porgy and Bess , " in another touring production that won both a Tony and a Grammy . <p> At the same time , Gockley began an ambitious commissioning program that would ultimately lead to an unprecedented string of more than 25 world premieres . " The Seagull , " Thomas Pasatieri 's operatic treatment of the Chekhov play , premiered in 1974 , and soon the roster had grown to include works by John Adams ( " Nixon in China " ) , Leonard Bernstein ( " A Quiet Place " ) , Philip Glass ( " The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 " ) , Meredith Monk ( " Atlas " ) , Jake Heggie ( " The End of the Affair " ) and four operas by Carlisle Floyd . <p> " There was an opportunity for someone with an entrepreneurial instinct to make a name for the opera and the city , " critic Charles Ward says . " Gockley had that . And one characteristic of this city is that there 's no old money , and none of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston or San Francisco . So it 's open to people with new ideas if they can prove themselves . Gockley arrived at a good time in a city that would not automatically exclude him because he was a newcomer . " <p> Gockley 's initiatives went far beyond programming . He oversaw the creation of Texas Opera Theater , a touring company designed as a counterpart to San Francisco 's Western Opera Theater . In 1977 , together with Floyd , who was teaching at the University of Houston , he created the Houston Grand Opera Studio , the prestigious training program that has produced such operatic stars as Denyce Graves , Susanne Mentzer and DiDonato . He instituted a range of low-cost performances in English intended to bring in first-time operagoers . And he guided the aesthetic direction of the company toward a more vibrant , theatrically savvy style of production . <p> All of these initiatives were shaped by a desire to make opera into the populist art form it can be  --  a goal inspired at least in part by his early experiences at the City Opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opera , I loved watching what was happening with theatrically oriented stage directors like Frank Corsaro and Tito Capobianco , " Gockley says . " Without going crazy , there would be a novel and fresh approach to the idea of stage direction , and it gave me the idea that it was not the kind of stand-and-sing art form that I had seen very often at the Met . I got Frank to Houston very often in my time there . <p> " As for the English-language productions , Santa Fe in my time was all in English . I remember Lotfi ( Mansouri ) directing productions of ' The Barber of Seville ' and ' Cenerentola '  --  or rather ' Cinderella '  --  and how great it was to see an audience really getting it and being right there with it and guffawing at all the right times . So in Houston we would do two casts of an opera  --  one cast in the original language , and the other in English singing for an audience that was basically paying half price . It was onerous on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night and two days later the English opening night , and the chorus and some of the cast in smaller parts had to go both ways . But there was always that wish to popularize the form , either through price or venue or repertoire , and to get it out beyond the typical European opera in a foreign language done for high society . And there are still people who come up to me and say that was their introduction to opera . " <p> In the meantime , Gockley 's marriage had broken up as Wise 's career in Europe took off . He married a second time , to a local singer named Adair Lewis who had served a brief stint with the San Francisco Opera Chorus before moving back to Houston . They had three children  --  Meredith , 26 , a preschool teacher ; Lauren , 24 , a pastry chef ; and Adam , 18 , a high school senior  --  and Gockley remains a devoted family man , speaking of all three with obvious pride and affection . <p> At Houston Grand Opera , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supertitles were installed in 1984 . In the mid-1980s , in the face of a withering economic downturn in the oil market , Gockley campaigned for the creation of the Wortham Theater Center , the company 's current home , which comprises both the 2,330-seat Brown Theater and the more intimate 1,065-seat Cullen Theater . <p> " He 's very persuasive about his vision of what a company can be , " Floyd says , " and confident in his ability to persuade people of what he wants to do . I remember talking to him once in the early ' 80s when he was first thinking about the Wortham Theater , and he told me , ' I feel that if I do n't get the two theaters , I ca n't stay in Houston . ' And I said to myself  --  though not to him  --  ' Dream on . ' But the next thing we know there 's the Wortham Theater . " <p> Gockley 's populist streak led to the invention of Plazacasts , in which performances inside the Wortham are simulcast onto a huge video @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ free by audiences in the Fish Plaza outside . <p> " When you think that Cecilia Bartoli is singing in there in the theater , and people can just pull up a chair and see the whole thing that people inside are paying hundreds of dollars for , it 's thrilling , " Holmes says . <p> In the early ' 90s , Gockley realized that the company 's relationship with the Houston Symphony was becoming problematic and that the company would need to create its own orchestra to keep performances at a respectable level . The result was the establishment of the Houston Grand Opera Orchestra and the hiring of Summers as music director . <p> " Christoph Eschenbach had come on as music director at the Symphony , and when he conducted , all the first-chair players who ordinarily did not want to play opera would play because they were currying favor with him . But when you 're not playing for your employer , it 's a different story . And then because of Christoph 's desire to conduct and record and tour , the Symphony told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the seven or eight productions in the season . And that 's when things began to deteriorate . It was not a good time economically in Houston in the early ' 90s , and a lot of the freelance players that we called upon just could n't cobble together a living , so they would drift away . It was one step away from a pickup band . I went to the Symphony and said either you are or are not our orchestra . " <p> Lanny Martin , a former Houston Grand Opera board president , has high praise for Gockley 's diplomacy in handling the organizational breakup . " The audience just loved the arrangement , and a lot of the major philanthropic people in town , including the corporate people , thought it was a great collaboration . But then David came forward and said , ' It 's not working . We need to develop our own orchestra . ' There was some concern about that , but he laid out a five-year plan for the transition , giving everyone time to adjust and get ready , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tenure in Houston stretched into decades , and as his name became increasingly synonymous with that of the company , it began to look as though he would spend the remainder of his career in the job where he began . The company was producing eight operas a season on an annual operating budget of more than $20 million . When vacancies arose at other opera companies  --  most notably at the San Francisco Opera after Mansouri 's retirement in 2001  --  <p> his name was routinely raised , but he never seemed to wind up on the short list of candidates . <p> In the meantime , though , Gockley had gone through a series of life-changing episodes . His second marriage , by all accounts a tempestuous one , ended . He underwent open-heart surgery to replace a faulty cardiac valve . A third marriage , entered into after a whirlwind courtship , broke up after only 18 months . When San Francisco finally came calling , Gockley was as surprised as anyone to realize that he was now in the market for a change . <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it put me in a position to make a run for this particular opportunity in my life . I was a free agent . If my wife had been employed in a career in Houston that could n't be moved  --  well , that 's a hard one . It would 've been more difficult to say , ' Sure , I 'll go . ' Because I 've never been one to say ' me first . ' But after all those years in Houston , I was glad to get this jolt  --  and believe me , it was a jolt . " <p> Since the fall , Gockley has been living in a small , immaculate condo in Sausalito . The unit is perched on a hillside overlooking the bay , with a deck where he can make calls and read budgets while gazing eastward toward the Bay Bridge . The decor is spare , although the living room is adorned with three William Wegman photographs in which the artist 's trademark Weimaraners are dressed up as opera characters  --  Tosca in one , Boris Godunov in another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eats his meals in restaurants . Photographs of his children and of himself as an undergraduate chorister are piled in the study , awaiting placement in a suitable frame or album . But otherwise Gockley may have fewer memorabilia than any of his colleagues  --  no framed letters from famous composers , no pictures of himself with great divas . <p> As that Giants cap demonstrated , he 's making a good-faith effort to switch his loyalties to the local sports teams  --  not an easy task for a man who has lived and died with the Astros for so long , and who made sure to watch every game of the World Series . " It took me 15 years to cut the Phillies loose , " he says  --  " and they were easy to cut loose . " <p> But Gockley also exudes the self-assurance of a man who knows that he has little to lose in tackling his new assignment . Whatever may happen here , his legacy in Houston is secure ; and after expecting to spend the remainder of his career in the same place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like San Francisco 's is a pure bonus . " I have every expectation that I 'll be able to make this work . But at some point the board will evaluate me on the job I 'm doing , and if I 'm not doing it well enough , they 'll be right to let me go . I 'd be perfectly happy in retirement .
