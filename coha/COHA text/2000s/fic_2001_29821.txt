Departing Poughkeepsie June 1960 She stands by the door , a tall , elegant woman with a soft brown color to her skin ( southern Italian ? a Mediterranean Jew ? a light-skinned negro woman who has been allowed to pass by virtue of her advanced degrees ? ) , and reviews the empty rooms that have served as home for the last eighteen years . Now in the full of June , the attic is hot . Years back , when she earned tenure , the dean offered her a more modern apartment , nearer to the campus . But she refused . She has always loved attics , their secretiveness , their niches and nooks , where those never quite at home in the house can hide . And this one has wonderful light . Shafts of sunlight swarm with dust motes , as if the air were coming alive . It is time for fresh blood in this old house . On the second floor , right below her , Vivian Lafleur from the Music Department is getting on in years and going a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortissimo , her foot heavy on the pedal . Her older sister , Dot , has already retired from Admissions and moved in with her " baby " sister . " Come quickly , Viv , " she sometimes hollers from her bedroom . The music stops . Could this be it for Dot ? On the ground floor , Florence from History has been called back from her retirement after the young medievalist from Yale stumbled into a manhole and broke her ankle . " I 'm so grateful . " Flo cornered her one day downstairs by their mailboxes . " I was beginning to go batty in that cottage in Maine . " She herself is worried about the emptiness that lies ahead . Childless and motherless , she is a bead unstrung from the necklace of the generations . All she leaves behind here are a few close colleagues , also about to retire , and her students , those young immortals with , she hopes , the Spanish subjunctive filed away in their heads . She must not let herself get morbid . It is 1960 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying alarming , wonderful things about the new patria they are creating . The Dalai Lama , who fled Tibet last year on a yak with the Chinese at his heels , has issued a statement : One must love one 's enemies , or else all is lost . ( But you have lost everything , she thinks . ) This winter she read of an expedition to Antarctica led by Vivian Fuchs . Sir Vivian has asked the world to agree not to dump its nuclear waste there . ( Why dump it anywhere ? Camila wonders . ) But these are positive signs , she reminds herself , positive signs . It is not a new habit of hers : these efforts to rouse herself from a depressive turn of mind she inherited from her mother . Of course , sometimes the bigger picture is rather grim . So ? Use your subjunctive ( she reminds herself ) . Make a wish . Contrary to possibility , contrary to fact . Most of her things have already been sent ahead , several trunks and boxes , years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the essentials . She is taking only her suitcase and the trunk of her mother 's papers and poems carried down just now by the school grounds crew to the waiting car . To think that only a few months ago , she was consulting those poems for signs ! She smiles at the easy gimmick she thought would resolve the big question in her life . Now , playfully , she imagines the many lives she has lived as captioned by the title of one or another of her mother 's poems . How should this new life be titled ? " Faith in the Future " ? " The Arrival of Winter " ? or ( why not ? ) " Love and Yearning " ? The horn honks again . It will probably be titled " Ruins " if she does n't get downstairs soon ! Marion is impatient to go , red-faced and swearing , jerking the steering wheel as she turns the car around . " Lady driver , " one of the men mutters under his breath . Marion and Les , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move . ( Marion 's companion of ten years finally proposed marriage . ) Now the two best friends will head down to Florida in a rental car . Les has already been deposited ( Marion 's verb ) in New Hampshire at his daughter 's door , so that Marion and Camila can have this last trip together . All the way down to Baltimore and Jacksonville and on to Key West and her ferry to Havana , Marion will try talking her out of her plans . " Everyone who is anyone is getting out . " " Well then , I 'll have no problem . ' I 'm Nobody -- Who are you ? ' " She loves to quote Miss Dickinson , whose home she once visited , whose fierce talent reminds her of her own mother 's . Emily Dickinson is to the United States of America as Salom Urea is to the Dominican Republic -- something like that . One of her nieces -- is it Lupe ?  - -  loves those analogies in the game books Camila takes them when she goes to visit . But she herself always feels nervous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong . Look at my life , she thinks , hither and yon , hither and yon . But now --  " Shall we have a drumroll , shall we blow the trumpet , and pipe a ditty on the flute ? " Marion teases -- she is heading home , or as close to home as she can get . Trujillo has made her own country an impossible choice . Perhaps it will all turn out well , perhaps , perhaps . " You are not nobody , Camila , " her friend scolds . " Do n't be modest now ! " Marion loves to brag . She is from the midwestern part of the country , and so she is easily impressed by somebodies , especially when they come from either coast or from foreign countries . ( " Camila 's mother was a famous poet . " " Her father was president . " " Her brother was the Norton Lecturer at Harvard . " ) Perhaps Marion thinks that such reflected importance will stem the tide of prejudice that often falls on the foreign and colored in this country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cross burning on her front lawn that long ago summer Camila visited the Reed family in North Dakota ? " You need a hand with anything else , Miss Henry ? " one of the burly janitorial crew calls up . Her name is Henrquez ( " accent on the i " ) , she has told them more than once , and they have repeated her name slowly , but the next time she requires their assistance , they have forgotten . Miss Henry , Miss Henriette . Beyond them on College Street , in their pastel shirtwaist dresses , a group of young graduates hurries by on the way to some last gathering . They look like blossoms released from their stems . One of them turns suddenly , a hand at her brow , shielding her eyes from the sun , a flag of red hair . " Hasta luego , Profesora , " she calls out to the flashing attic windows . She could n't possibly see me , the professor is thinking . I am already gone from this place . Before she leaves , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has not been able to shake since her mother 's death sixty-three years ago . In the name of the Father and of the Son and of my mother , Salom . Her aunt Ramona , her mother 's only sister , taught her to do this . Dear old Mon , round and brown with a knot of black hair on top of her head , a Dominican Buddha but with none of the bodhisattva 's calm . Mon was more superstitious than religious and more cranky than anything else . Back then , it was a habit to kiss each parent 's hand and ask their blessing before leaving the house . La bendicin , Mam . La bendicin , Pap . ( The American girls made faces in class when she told them about this old tradition . " What a drag , " the plump , freckled girl from Cooperstown said , lifting one corner of her mouth as if the old-world practice had a bad smell . ) When her mother died , Mon thought up this way for her to ask for Salom 's blessing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year became less and less real until all that was left of her mother was the story of her mother . Sometimes the phrase is part prayer , part curse -- as now when she hears the loud , rude honk from down below and mutters it under her breath . Marion will be the death of Dot yet . The two sisters have always been kind to their quiet upstairs neighbor , that condescending kindness of natives toward foreigners who are not frightening . Dot knits her awful matching accessories every winter that she must wear once in a while to show her appreciation . Another loud honk , then the call , " Hey Cam ! Did you have a coronary up there or what ? " She peers down from the back window and waves to her friend that she will be right down . Marion stands beside her rental car , a Caribe turquoise Oldsmobile . They have debated the color . ( She is from the Caribbean , and she has never seen that color blue , she argues . But the manual Marion whipped out from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands at her hips , her baggy trousers , and paisley scarf tied around her neck ( can she really be from North Dakota ? ) , Marion could be the drama coach at the college , barking at the girls up on the stage . Years of teaching physical education have kept Marion fit and trim , and her hardy midwestern genes have done the rest . She is warm-hearted and showy , kicking up a storm wherever she goes . " Are you Spanish , too ? " people often ask , and with her dark hair and bright eyes Marion could pass , though her skin is so pale that Camila 's father often worried that she might be anemic or consumptive . They have lived through so much , some of which is best left buried in the past , especially now that Marion is a respectable married lady . ( " I do n't know about the respectable , " Marion laughs . ) In her politics , however , Marion is as conservative as her recently acquired husband , Lesley Richards III , whose perennial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were being preserved for posterity . He is rich and alcoholic and riddled with ailments . She should not think so unkindly . By the door hangs the chart her student helper drew up when they were sorting through the family trunks . Camila found the scrap of paper when she was cleaning up , no doubt inadvertently left behind . She was so amused by this young girl 's vision of her life , she tacked it up on her bulletin board . She considers taking it down , then decides to leave this curious memento for the next tenant to ponder . The car honks again , another shout of summons . It will be a long ride to Florida . She has measured the route on the large atlas at the library using her fingers to figure out the distance . Each finger a day on the road . Five fingers , a handful , with Marion singing old campfire songs and driving too fast , especially with Salom 's trunk tied to the roof of the car . On the passenger 's side , Camila clutches the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't run into a rainstorm , hopes and prays that Marion will not try to talk her out of her decision by reminding her that she is sixty-six , alone , and should be thinking about her pension , should be thinking about her future , should be thinking about moving into a comfy bungalow just down the road from Marion , at least until things settle down at home in those hot-tempered little islands . " In the name of my mother , Salom , " she says to herself again . She needs all the help she can get here at the end of her life in the United States . Somewhere past Trenton , New Jersey , to keep her restless friend from further distractions ( " Light me a cigarette , will you ? " " Any more of those chips left ? " " I sure could use a soda ! " ) , she offers : " Shall I tell you why I have decided to go back ? " Marion has been pestering Camila ever since she arrived a few days ago to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That 's what I want to know . What do you hope to accomplish with a bunch of ill-mannered , unshaven , unwashed guerrillas running a country ? " Purposely , she believes , Marion mispronounces the word so it sounds like gorillas . " Guerrillas , " Camila corrects , rattling the r 's . She has been afraid she will sound foolish if she explains how just once before her life is over , she would like to give herself completely to something -- yes , like her mother . Friends would worry that she had lost her wits , too much sugar in her blood , her cataracts blurring all levels of her vision . And Marion 's disapproval would be the worst of all , for she would not only disagree with Camila 's choice , she would try to save her . Marion has turned to face her . Briefly , the car weaves into the left lane . A honk from an oncoming car startles Marion , and she pulls back over just in time . Camila takes a deep breath . Perhaps the future will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all ears , " Marion says when they have both recovered . Camila 's heart is still beating wildly -- one of those bats that sometimes gets trapped in her attic apartment so that she has to call the grounds crew to come get it out . " I have to go back a ways , " she explains . " I have to start with Salom . " " Can I confess something ? " Marion asks , not a real question , as she does not wait for Camila to answer back . " Please do n't get your feelings hurt , but I honestly do n't think I would ever have heard of your mother unless I had met you . " She 's not surprised . Americans do n't interest themselves in the heroes and heroines of minor countries until someone makes a movie about them . Up ahead a man on a billboard is smoking a cigarette ; behind him a herd of cattle waits until he finishes it . " So , what 's the story ? " Marion wants to know . " As I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means at the birth of la patria , since they were both born about the same time . " Her voice sounds strangely her own and not her own . All those years in the classroom . Her half brother Rodolfo calls it her teacher 's handicap , how she vanishes into whatever she 's teaching . She 's done it all her life . Long before she stepped into a classroom , she indulged this habit of erasing herself , of turning herself into the third person , a minor character , the best friend ( or daughter ! ) of the dying first-person hero or heroine . Her mission in life after the curtain falls to tell the story of the great ones who have passed on . But Marion is not going to indulge her . Camila has not gotten past the first few years of Salom 's life and the wars of independence when her friend interrupts . " I thought you were finally going to talk about yourself , Camila . " " I am talking about myself , " she says -- and waits until they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afloat on its aluminum sides -- before she begins again .
