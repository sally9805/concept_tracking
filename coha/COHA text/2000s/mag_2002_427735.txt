Surf for the Spirit Because of the spiritual tools I have found on the Web , I now go to Mass more often , I receive the sacrament of Penance on a regular basis , and I am now working with a spiritual director . " I ENJOYED READING " NET GAINS : HOW THE INTERNET IS changing the church " ( October ) by Renee M. LaReau , and I wanted to share a few thoughts . Like many of your readers , I stay away from chat rooms , but I regularly surf the Net for news , information , and resources to enhance my faith life and education . I am disabled , so this invaluable tool has helped me when I could n't physically go places to do research . Last Lent I started visiting Sacred Space , which has helped me immensely . When I am stressed out , I visit this site and find an oasis of prayer and quietude . Also , I am now in my sixth week of the 34-week online Ignatian spiritual exercises retreat through Creighton University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Web , I now go to Mass more often , I receive the sacrament of Penance on a regular basis , and I am now working with a spiritual director . Between my online and off-line prayer , I 'm spending more time with God than I ever have in my life . I am finally experiencing what it means to be in the presence of God all day long . I view the Internet as a tool and a jumping-off point . It is not a replacement for real community . I use the fruits of what I receive online in my parish community and in my personal relationships . Paula Zimmermann San Francisco , Calif . My favorite Catholic Web sites , Ecumene , Catholic-Center , Mirlo , GoddeWords , Illuminare , and VaticanII-Doc , all at yahoogroups.com , have provided me with an experience opposite to what LaReau has written . Contrary to the style of Web sites that list link after link to documents , articles , and meditations , these sites are people-oriented with the e-mail conversational format . While friendships are made among individuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communities , as most , if not all , members are already involved in their own churches . All of the groups have fostered the educational spirit of the Catholic Church with questions , discussion , insights , and opinions offered by members with ample time for reflection . People who come to these groups are not looking for spirituality . They are already spiritual people who deepen their faith and broaden their minds with the interested support of other Christians through theology , Bible study , ecumenism , and the general study of the Catholic Church . Through the Internet , I have learned more about the church in three or four years than I have in my earlier four decades through my parish or diocese . Anne Malcolm Middlefield , Conn . Building bridges Once again Tom McGrath has hit the nail on the head in his November The Examined Life ( " What do you do with such pain ? " ) . We must be building bridges rather than burning them . Find those who perpetrated the foul deeds of September 11 and bring them to justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that McGrath describes so eloquently and that will only be lose-lose situations . Hate consumes us like a cancer if we let it . If we truly follow Jesus , we will love our enemies , we will build bridges with Islam , we will build relationships that are right , since " right relationships " is another ( better ) translation of the Greek word in Paul 's letters that is often rendered as " righteousness . " The triune God , in whose image we are made , calls us into relationships . Will we respond to that call ? Or will we deny our cross , act out of pain , rather than live and love through it ? Patrick Jurd Melbourne , Australia I am a mother of two children , and I live in Cape Town , South Africa , where we have also been victims in recent years of indiscriminate bombing by supposed Muslim extremists . My parish priest and local Catholic paper have always called us to task about laying blame at the feet of all Muslims and in fact called us to admire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have needed these reminders to prevent me from labeling all Muslim people . Photograph // We live in an information age . People can be reached by newspapers , magazines , radio , television , film , and the Internet . Those responsible for disseminating information through the media have a responsibility to ensure that a spiritual message is relayed . We need to hear these messages at least in balance with all else that is thrown at us by these media . I would have liked to have seen more religious leaders from around the world on CNN giving their responses to the tragedy that we witnessed in horror . As a Roman Catholic , I wanted to see and hear the pope , and I would have definitely been very interested in hearing from Muslim and Jewish spiritual leaders . Name withheld via e-mail See you in heaven " Will Catholics be lonely in heaven ? " , the September cover story by Robert McClory , is something I often think about . The first Bible study I attended in a home was an interdenominational one , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were always welcome . I believe that God is present to all who seek him . I do n't believe we 'll be lonely ; I think we 'll meet many other people there , and I will be happy to see them . Shirley Noel via e-mail These are my cups ... The question the September Glad You Asked article ( " Why drink from the cup ? " by Jim Dinn ) does not address is : Why drink from one cup ? I have heard liturgists speak about the powerful symbolism of drinking from a single cup and its faithfulness to the way it was done at the Last Supper , but so what ? They also apparently ate from a single loaf of bread . But we do n't bother with that symbolism at Communion time . The real issue becomes one of priorities : Is it more important to hold on to the one-cup rule in spite of all we learn and teach about hygiene , or is it more important to have people drink the Precious Blood ? Does anyone really think that as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people will be more likely to drink from that single cup ? Why not learn from other Christian churches and use their idea of individual cups to foster greater participation ? We are encouraged by documents from the Second Vatican Council to remember that " full participation " should be a very high priority and may need to take precedence over history and symbolism . L.A. Reinhart Reno , Nev . Does Dinn 's article provide an answer ? I do n't think so . In fact , it does a great disservice to those faithful Catholics who have chosen , for whatever reason , not to drink from the cup . It makes them feel that their participation in the Eucharist is not as full as it could be , or should be . And the implied statement that they are receiving the legal minimum , rather than the fullness of Christ 's Body and Blood , is blatantly false . This kind of sophism can only lead to the creation of two classes of recipients . Will one receive more grace than the other ? Charles N. Marrelli Irvine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
