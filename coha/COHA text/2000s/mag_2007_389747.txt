Headnote Here 's how to distinguish some of nature 's harmless and potentially harmful look-alikes . The trail I was hiking skirted a popular picnic area , and as I passed a family having lunch the mother suddenly shrieked : " Sara ! Get down from that fence ! It 's covered with poison ivy ! " The little girl , about 5 years old , leapt to the ground and stared at the accused leafy monster , her eyes wide with alarm . I winced . Clearly the vine curling over the fence was n't poison ivy , but Virginia creeper , a somewhat similar-looking-and entirely harmless-plant . A case of mistaken identity had needlessly frightened the youngster and sullied a carefree family outing . Ironically , as I glanced at the scene again , the mother was standing , open-sandaled , in a patch of actual poison ivy . There are many look-alikes in nature , and while most pose little urgency , its important to know how to tell hazardous flora and fauna from similar-looking safe species . In most cases , me knowledge simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry ; in others , it can make the difference between safety and personal risk . BEES &; WASPS VS . FLOWER FLIES Bzzzzt ! Watch out for that fuzzy , yellow-and-black striped ... fly ? A variety of harmless insects fool bug-gobbling predators by wearing the same watch-out-I-sting gang colors as bees or wasps . The most common are syrphid ( or flower ) flies , a large family of imposters that are startlingly convincing . But the truth is , they do n't have stingers and could n't hurt a ... well , you know . Many syrphids buzz just like their ouch-instigating counterparts , and can be alarmingly bold . The yellowjacket hover fly has a habit of buzzing up to a person and hovering there for a moment , as if to say , " Boo ! " At least a dozen other flower flies resemble yellowjackets , while many others mimic honeybees , bumblebees , carpenter bees and all manner of wasps . Syrphid flies are important pollinators , and the larvae of many species are voracious predators of plant-sucking aphids . The next time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick to hit the panic button . POISON IVY VS . LOOK-ALIKES They are the terrible trio of American flora : poison sumac , oak and ivy . Fortunately , the former is limited to swampy terrain in the East and Midwest . And though poison oak is common along the West Coast and in sandy soils in the lower East and Midwest , its oaklike leaves and typically shrublike posture are comparatively easy to spot . Poison ivy , though , hides . It 's not just the mosquito of the botanic world ; it 's the chameleon . It can be a vine , a shrub or treelike . It creeps , climbs and stands on its own . Its leaves can be green , yellow or red ; oval or lance-shaped ; toothed , lobed or smooth-edged ; light or dark ; shiny or dull . Botanists ca n't even agree on how many poison ivy species exist . Most agree there are two main kinds of poison ivy ; the eastern type tends to climb as a vine and the western tends to be shrubby-but neither is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermingles with look-alikes . We 've all heard the old saw , " Leaves of three , leave it be , " and poison ivy does indeed bear leaves in groups of three . But so do many innocent plants , such as wild strawberry , jack-in-thepulpit , blackberry , raspberry , box elder and hog-peanut . You 'd have to stay home to steer clear of them all . Other plants only vaguely resemble poison ivy , but share similar growth habits . Virginia creeper has five leaves , not three , and those leaves are distinctly toothed , while poison ivy 's are not . But like poison ivy , its spring greenery is triangular and glossy ; it climbs fences and trees as a twining vine , and in the fall its foliage changes from green to scarlet . How , then , can you avoid poison ivy ? First , learn to recognize the plant in all its forms . But beyond that , keep a wary eye out not only for the plant itself , but also for signs that it may be hiding nearby ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In the United States , there are two groups of venomous snakes : pit vipers , which include rattlesnakes , copperheads and cottonmouths , and coral snakes , which are comparatively rare . Pit vipers get their name from the tiny , heat-sensing ( and thus prey-detecting ) pit located on each side of the head , between the eye and nostril . Obviously , if you see a snake with rattles you know it 's venomous . This makes identifying a dangerous snake easier in the West , where rattlesnakes are the only pit vipers . ( Keep in mind , however , that rattle-snakes can lose their ratdes . ) In the eastern United States , rattle-less cottonmouths and copperheads complicate matters . Both bear markings similar to those of many harmless species . To distinguish a pit viper from a look-alike , look ( from a distance , ideally using binoculars ) for the telltale distinctions listed on Page 30 . Snakes with large bodies and distinct patterns , such as rat snakes , corn snakes and hog-nosed , are easily misidentified . It 's especially easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they share physical features and similar habitat . With copperheads , look at the snakes pattern . Its hourglassshaped crossbands are narrow in the center of the back and wide along the sides . On water snakes , they 're the opposite-fattest along the snake 's center and narrow at the sides . Cottonmouths vary in color from solid brown , black or olive , to patterns of these colors . Body language and behavior can be more important clues for distinguishing them from water snakes . On land , cottonmouths are poor climbers and are more likely to form a tight circular coil on a stump or log just above water level . Water snakes usually hang draped over a branch in a tree or bush . In the water , a cottonmouth swims with its head held well above the water 's surface ; water snakes swim totally immersed . Habitat and range are critical , common-sense considerations , too . Cottonmouths , for instance , inhabit only the South and lower Midwest . Even if you live in one of those regions , you can rest a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they favor . A good field guide will tell you which snakes actually live in your area , and the kinds of places they tend to call home . Compared to pit vipers , coral snakes are relatively small-usually no more than 2 feet long-and mild-mannered . They spend most of their time underground or beneath forest litter , and their primary prey is other snakes . But when coral snakes do bite , they pack a dangerous punch . Members of the same deadly family as cobras , their venom is exceedingly potent . Fortunately , a coral snakes bright bands of yellow , red and black make it easy to spot . But you might be looking at one of its harmless near-twins , the scarlet snake and scarlet kingsnake , both of which occupy part of the coral 's southern coastal range , from North Carolina to east Texas . A simple saying to help tell the snakes apart is , " Red touch yellow , kills a fellow ; yellow touch black , safe for Jack . " The rule of thumb applies for both U.S. species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western ) coral snake . It 's not always reliable for similar snakes south of the border , though . And in the Sonoran coral 's range , south-central Arizona to southwestern New Mexico , nonvenomous shovel-nosed snakes wear adjacent red and yellow bands , too . Scientists are n't sure whether the scarlets are mimicking the coral , or the other way around . For years they thought the impostors had adapted the coral 's colorful bands as a survival strategy . Predators that learned the hard way to avoid coral snakes would avoid them , too . But wait a minute : a coral snake 's bite is not a learning experience . Almost invariably , the victim dies . Perhaps , instead , the coral snake has taken on the harmless snakes ' color as a sort of sheep 's clothing . For safety 's sake , steer clear of all brightly banded species wherever corals roam . GRIZZLY VS . BLACK BEARS In the West , where black and grizzly bears share habitat , knowing one from the other is serious business . Black bears have evolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fight-offense is their defense . In a surprise encounter with a black bear , most experts advise to stand your ground and , if necessary , shout and wave your arms to scare it away . But if it 's a grizzly , they suggest , that behavior might provoke an attack . Instead act nonthreatening . Avoid eye contact and back away slowly . But figuring out which bear you 're dealing with can be difficult . Coat color is n't a reliable distinction , because some grizzlies can have near-black fur , and many western black bears wear brownish fur akin to that of lighter-colored grizzlies . There are distinctive differences between the two species , but no one feature is defining . You have to put together all the clues ( see the list above ) to reach a reasonable conclusion . Experts advise looking at the head first-the relative size of ears , the facial profile , the shape . Remember , too , that the safest strategy is to avoid bears , period . Like all wild animals , black bears and grizzly bears are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and armed-tooth and claw . When it comes to bears , consider them all members of a single species : Respectimus maximus . FAMILIARITY IS THE KEY Knowing what to look for-and what not to worry about-is the key to distinguishing safe from potentially harmful species . Studying field guides is a great way to familiarize yourself with the safe-or-sorry plants and insects in your area . Nature centers and zoos offer you an opportunity to get to know animals such as snakes and bears safely . But ultimately , of course , the best teacher of all is experience in the outdoors . The more time you spend outside and the more familiar you become with the flora and fauna around you , the more you can enjoy the natural world .
