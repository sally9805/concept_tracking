<p> Gary Barnett will be reinstated as the University of Colorado 's head football coach and athletic director Dick Tharp will remain in his job after both agreed to reforms addressing CU 's recruiting scandal , sources said late Wednesday . <p> Tharp 's status was decided Wednesday night after CU- <p> Boulder chancellor Richard Byyny presented Tharp with a series of conditions that would be required of him to remain in his job . Some of those conditions would curtail Tharp 's authority . <p> Two of the changes Tharp was told to expect , according to sources : that he would report to CU provost Phil DiStefano instead of Byyny and that athletics will be overseen by a new governing board whose members will include faculty leaders . <p> While Tharp agreed to the terms , his powers are so sharply curtailed that some sources questioned whether he would choose to remain in the job for long . <p> Today , CU president Betsy Hoffman and Byyny are expected to announce those reforms and others suggested to them this month by the Boulder Faculty Assembly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final personnel decisions . <p> Hoffman is expected to characterize her reforms as a call for sweeping change throughout college athletics . <p> In a meeting Tuesday night , Hoffman asked Barnett to agree to certain new conditions of his employment , sources said . The coach , whom Hoffman suspended with pay Feb. 18 , agreed to the new terms , the sources said . <p> As Hoffman herself has predicted would happen , advance word of Barnett 's reinstatement elicited a mix of elation and outrage Wednesday . <p> ' It 's absolutely good news , ' said Patty Klopfenstein , whose son , Joe , is a CU tight end . ' It 's wonderful news . ' <p> Others disagreed , calling Barnett 's reinstatement a return to the status quo . <p> ' I worry about what this means for women who are going to be raped in the future by anybody high-profile on campus , whether it 's a football player or a faculty member or anything else , ' CU sociology professor Joanne Belknap said . <p> The controversy springs from federal lawsuits filed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sexual assaults during a 2001 recruiting weekend . In all , nine women have reported being raped by CU football players or recruits since 1997 . <p> ' It 's no surprise , ' said Regina Cowles , a spokeswoman for the National Organization for Women in Boulder . ' It seems to me that the regents and the president have been aiming for this moment since day one . ' <p> Barnett 's players said they looked forward to welcoming their coach back to the team . <p> ' I feel like he was never gone , ' junior running back Lawrence Vickers said . ' I 've seen him around . He was jolly . Everybody needs a break , and that 's all it was , a break . ' <p> But Barnett could be returning to a climate very different from that of most Division I football programs . <p> At a Big 12 Conference meeting in New Mexico this week , DiStefano said he expected to see some of the faculty 's proposals put into action , including his new supervisory role , the establishment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CU student-athletes . <p> In its final report last week , an independent CU commission that investigated the recruiting scandal incorporated the faculty 's proposals . <p> For weeks , supporters of CU football have been asking Hoffman to let them know whether she remains committed to competitive football in Boulder . <p> ' Just getting Gary back is the first step , ' Klopfenstein said . ' Then we move on to what this team is going to look like , if it 's going to be competitive . ' <p> The meetings Byyny and Hoffman had with Tharp and Barnett this week were needed to ensure their commitment to change , CU Regent Susan Kirk said . <p> ' Clearly there will be changes , and she 's presenting them with her scenario to see if they can live with the changes , ' Kirk said . ' If you 're going to institute significant changes , you have to get the players ( Barnett and Tharp ) on board or change the players . ' <p> Barnett , his attorney and Tharp all declined to comment . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision to keep all of its personnel in place was worrisome <p> ' They should have some fresh air in there , ' said commission member Jean Dubofsky , a former Colorado Supreme Court judge . ' But I do n't know if Hoffman 's really capable of firing anyone . ' <p> Dubofsky said it would have been more difficult to fire Barnett than Tharp . Barnett has a contract with CU , worth roughly $ 1 million a year , that the school would have had to pay out for three more years , even if he were fired , she said . Tharp has no contract . <p> Dubofsky and other members of the now-disbanded commission say they thought their report , which accused Tharp of ignoring Byyny 's demands for reform and of maintaining ' plausible deniability ' when it came to recruiting weekends , gave Hoffman sufficient ammunition to replace him . <p> ' I fully expected , maybe even desired , that the president would keep Barnett as coach , ' said Phillip Porter , a Pentecostal bishop and member of the university-appointed commission . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tharp on . ' <p> Peggy Lamm , one of the commission 's co-chairwomen , predicted that no matter what is announced this week , Byyny and Tharp will be allowed to resign ' gracefully ' within a year . ' I will be surprised a year from now if all of these people are still in their positions , ' she said . <p> CU did not get the commission 's message on Tharp , Porter said . <p> ' I thought we all had a consensus that he would go , and I thought that was clear enough in the report , ' he said . ' Boy , oh boy , we spent a lot of money , a lot of time , a lot of anxiety , and nothing accomplished , ' Porter said . <p> The commission spent more than $ 200,000 during its nearly three-month inquiry , records show . <p> A task force of investigators led by state Attorney General Ken Salazar , whom Gov . Bill Owens appointed as a special prosecutor in the case , also is looking into the matter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former football recruiting assistant and three prostitutes , who say were hired by the assistant to have sex with young men . <p> Pete Steinhauer , chairman of the CU Board of Regents , said that after exhaustive investigation , Barnett and Tharp have been cleared of any wrongdoing . <p> ' We 've had the investigative panel . We 've had the special prosecutor . We 've put all these things together and we 've used our thoughts on it too , ' he said . <p> ' In the long run , they 've done what they believe is the best thing for the university , ' he said . <p> John DiBiaggio , the past president of three universities who was hired to help Byyny and Hoffman study the culture of the athletic department , said that because the investigative panel failed to show that Barnett knew of or condoned the parties , he could understand Hoffman 's decision , ' as long as there are checks and balances put in place , ' DiBiaggio said . <p> DiBiaggio declined to comment on Tharp . <p> Barnett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scandal , which erupted in late January with the release of depositions from one of the lawsuits in federal court . <p> In the following weeks , other women - including Katie Hnida , a former CU place-kicker and the first-ever female member of the team - came forward to say they had been sexually assaulted by CU players or recruits . <p> When asked by reporters about Hnida 's charge , Barnett said he supported Hnida and encouraged her to report the name of the player to help investigators . <p> But he also told reporters asking why other players resented Hnida 's presence on the team that Hnida had been a ' terrible ' kicker . <p> Staff writers Chris Dempsey , Howard Pankratz and Adam Thompson contributed to this report . <p> Staff writer Jim Hughes can be reached at 303-820-1244 or jhughes@ denverpost.com .
