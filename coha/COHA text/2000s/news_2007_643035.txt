<p> WHEN you sit down to do your taxes , you remember that very generous birthday gift from your wealthy aunt , and wonder how , and where , you report it , or if it 's taxable at all . <p> The short answer is that you do n't have to report it , because it is n't taxable  --  at least not to you . And what about your aunt : If she gave you more than $12,000 , she must fill out a gift tax form , a step that Sidney Kess , a lawyer and accountant in New York , says is " not a big deal . " <p> She may have to pay gift tax , but only if she has been extremely generous , because the first $1 million in reported gifts over a lifetime does not activate the tax . <p> Anyone who gave more than $12,000 to any one person other than a spouse last year is required to file Form 709 , the gift tax return . Each Form 709 must list the amounts reported on previous years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the million-dollar threshold . <p> Actually , though , it 's possible to give away much more than $1 million before any tax is due , because many gifts need not be reported and are not added into the calculation that establishes the $1 million lifetime exemption . A gift or a series of gifts that add up to $12,000 or less to any one person from any other person in any given year does not have to be reported . For example , a plethora of , say , $10,000 gifts to many different people does not mean the tax will be imposed . <p> In fact , it is possible to transfer huge sums of money in just a few weeks , Perry A. Shulman , a certified public accountant in East Rockaway , N.Y. , explained . He gave the example of a married couple who give money to a child and the child 's spouse . " If each parent gives the child and the spouse $12,000 each , that 's $48,000 . If that gift is made in December , another $48,000 can be given in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total of $96,000 , " he said . <p> Money paid for someone else 's medical care or directly to a school or college for someone else 's tuition is also exempt from reporting , regardless of the amount . <p> The definition of educational institution is " very broad , " said Randi A. Schuster , a lawyer at Holtz Rubenstein Reminick , an accounting firm in New York City . " It can be for nursery school , private grade school , not just for what we normally think of in gifts  --  paying for college tuition . " <p> Many wealthy people are using the education-funding exemption as " a pretty savvy way to reduce an estate "  --  and thus the estate tax due at death , Mr. Kess said . He said that the I.R.S. advised a taxpayer in a private-letter ruling last year that she could pay tuition for six grandchildren years in advance and all at once , and the gifts would be exempt . <p> A private-letter ruling applies only to the taxpayer who requested it , but it " gives you an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . He said that " private schools and colleges are seeing a lot more people using that strategy " to minimize taxes , and are encouraging prepayments . <p> There is a caveat . Proud ( and wealthy ) new grandparents can not prepay an infant 's four years at Harvard , because if the child does n't go to Harvard , the money is not refundable . But under that private-letter ruling , prepayments for college or even for an entire grade-school and high-school private education could be made as soon as a child is admitted to a particular school , he said . <p> Julian Block , a lawyer in Larchmont , N.Y. , explained , " What people misunderstand is that if you give more than $12,000 in one year to one person , yes , you have to file , but for most people it 's a formality . They do n't actually incur any gift tax liability " because of the gift they made . <p> Mr. Block used the example of a father who gave a son $50,000 last year ; $38,000 is subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up  --  and leaves the father $962,000 for use against future gifts . Gift tax liability  --  where a check has to accompany the Form 709 , " is incurred only by people who are obscenely wealthy , " he said . <p> In fact , Mr. Block and his wife , Zelda , will have to file gift tax returns this year , because they gave their daughter , Nadine Block , and her husband , Patrick Vennebush , a gift to help them buy a house in Falls Church , Va. , a Washington suburb , last year . <p> But Mr. Block does n't ever expect to approach the point where gift tax will be due . " I 'd love to become affluent enough to have to pay the gift tax , " he said . " That 's unlikely to happen . " <p> His daughter , a policy analyst and researcher for a trade association in Washington , said that she and her husband were aware that , as recipients , they did not have to report the gift . Ms. Block and her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , prepare their own return , then give it to her father to review , she said . " I rely on his knowledge , " she said  --  adding that he usually finds deductions she has overlooked . <p> When a gift is exempt from the gift tax because it is for someone else 's education or medical care , it is vital for the payment to be made directly to the educational institution or health care provider , said Martin M. Shenkman , an estate-planning lawyer with offices in New York and Teaneck , N.J. <p> He said that many people mistakenly think that they can give their child money for a grandchild 's college tuition without regard to the gift tax limits . " That 's a very common mistake " he said , and it can activate the requirement to file a gift tax return , and in some situations , to pay gift tax . <p> The only exception to the giver-pays rule involves a donor 's nonpayment of gift tax that is due , despite the various exemptions , including the $1 million lifetime exclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ donor " does not pay the tax , the person receiving the gift may have to pay . " <p> Mr. Shenkman said that " in all my years , I 've never seen that happen " except , rarely , as part of a prearranged plan among family members . It is unlikely that a donor would inadvertently incur the gift tax in that way , he said . " If you 're giving away a million bucks , " you probably have top-notch legal and accounting advice , he said . <p> There can be gray areas involving gift taxes , however . Disputes can arise over whether the money or property was a gift . " Was it for services rendered ? " Mr. Block asked . If that is the case , it 's taxable to the recipient , he said . <p> Gifts that exceed the threshold should be reported each year to the I.R.S. on Form 709 . Copies should be kept with filers ' permanent tax records , because the executors of their estates will need to refer to those forms to determine whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a small fraction of estates . <p> Gift taxes that were paid by anyone who leaves a taxable estate can reduce estate taxes , said Diane Giordano , a C.P.A. and certified financial planner at Marcum &; Kliegman in Melville , N.Y . <p> Any part of the $1 million credit used on the gift tax forms reduces the amount of the credit available to an estate , which is $ 2 million this year , Mr. Shenkman said . <p> " You have $1 million to give away during life , " Ms. Schuster said . " At death you have a total of $2 million to give away . If you 've given away a million worth of taxable gifts , at death you 'll have only a million left to give away . " <p> There is no Form 709 equivalent of the joint income tax return . If both spouses have to file gift tax returns , each must do so separately . The reporting requirements for joint gifts from a husband and wife are a little trickier . If they agree to split gifts , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without having to file a Form 709 . <p> There is no income tax deduction for gifts to individuals , as there is for gifts to charities . If a charitable gift is tax deductible , there is no need to report it on a gift tax return , Ms. Schuster said , except when the donor gives less than the entire interest in a property  --  as is sometimes the case with a trust . Political contributions also do not fall under the gift-tax rules . <p> There are separate , more complicated tax rules for what are known as generation-skipping transfers , which are usually to grandchildren . <p> The gift tax rules can confuse even some reasonably financially savvy people . Some donors have been led astray by discussion of a proposed elimination of the estate tax , Ms. Giordano said . " Some people believe there 's been an elimination of the gift tax as well , " she said . Others think that recent changes to the estate tax apply to the gift tax , but , she counsels them , " there 's been an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ANOTHER point of confusion , Mr. Kess said , is the value of a noncash gift . If someone gives away stock or other property that has gone up in value since the donor bought it , its value when it was given away is the amount reported on the gift tax return  --  even though the lower amount becomes the recipient 's basis for figuring profit or loss when that property is sold . <p> Ms. Schuster said that some people were becoming confused about the regulations for 529 college savings plans . A contribution to someone else 's 529 plan is a gift , subject to the $12,000 exclusion rule . Under a special tax-law provision , a donor can give up to $60,000 to such an account at once and use up five years ' worth of $12,000 annual exclusions . <p> But then the donor can not legally make any more exempt gifts of any size to the recipient for five years  --  not even a birthday gift . " Just a card , " she said. ##
