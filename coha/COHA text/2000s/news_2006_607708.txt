<p> On Sunday night , when they take on the Phoenix Suns in Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference semifinals , the Los Angeles Clippers will try to continue their remarkable transformation from one of the most ridiculed franchises in professional sports into a winner . <p> With every game they play this postseason  --  their first playoff appearance since 1992-93  --  the Clippers seem to set a handful of franchise records , much to the pleasure of fans , players and coaches . <p> " It 's great to be part of the history books , and making this tradition , " said Elton Brand , Los Angeles 's softspoken star , at a recent practice . " We 're very proud , and we know that the organization is , too . " <p> After all , these are the Clippers , a team that until recently was synonymous with ineptitude . The championship banners and retired jerseys that hang from the rafters here at Staples Center , all of them belong to the city 's celebrated franchise , the Lakers . Former players do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ part , their tenure with the franchise is something they would rather not be associated with . <p> The history of the Clippers is one that most people would rather forget , or simply know nothing about . <p> " There really has n't been a history , " said Los Angeles Coach Mike Dunleavy . <p> But there has been . Not only that  --  some of that history is worth remembering , particularly for one of the players who helped make it . <p> On Sunday night from a condominium in Norwich , Conn. , 3,000 miles away from Staples Center , Randy Smith will be watching . He has been watching Los Angeles ever since the team reached the postseason , and he likes what he sees . <p> " I just love the whole team , " he said earlier this week in a telephone interview . " They play well together . They remind me of Detroit , where everybody has a role , and they play it well . . . . I would n't be surprised if they went all the way to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quiet 57-year-old , has faded into virtual anonymity . The front desk operator at the Mohegan Sun Casino , where Smith now works as the director of player development , was unaware he had been in the NBA . <p> " There 's a Randy Smith here , " said a woman who identified herself as Lenore . " I do n't know if he was a professional basketball player or not . " <p> He was that , and more . With the exception of Bob McAdoo , his teammate for five seasons with the Buffalo Braves ( the first incarnation of the Clippers ) , Smith is the greatest former player ever to have played for the team . <p> From a statistical standpoint , it is no contest . The Braves ' former No. 9 is the franchise leader in 10 categories , including points ( 12,735 ) , steals ( 2,018 ) , assists ( 3,498 ) and games played ( 715 ) . <p> This is not simply a function of being the only player to stay with the Clippers for an extended period of time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the MVP of the 1978 All-Star Game , coming off the bench to collect 27 points , 7 rebounds and 6 assists in the East 's 133-125 win over the West . " Greatest game I played in my life , " he said . <p> Born in North Carolina , Smith grew up on Long Island and was an all-American in track , soccer and basketball at Buffalo State College . Nevertheless , he was a virtual unknown , selected by Buffalo  --  an expansion team  --  in the seventh round of the 1971 NBA draft , and then , only as a token gesture to the community . <p> Those first few years were hard ones for Smith and the rest of Braves , marked by the same futility that characterized Clippers squads of recent memory . But from 1974 to 1976 , led by McAdoo , Smith , and Hall of Fame coach Jack Ramsay , Buffalo jelled , reaching the Eastern Conference semifinals for three consecutive seasons . <p> " We got some young players , and then the chemistry started to come together , " Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our way to at least being respectable . " <p> So was Smith . Given a chance to start in 1972 , he made the most of his opportunity , and quickly became known for his feathery shooting touch , eye-popping 360-degree dunks and unsurpassed speed on the floor . <p> " He 's been probably one of the most athletic guys , and definitely the fastest guy that I have ever played with , " said McAdoo , now an assistant coach with the Miami Heat . " Foot speed , forget it . He was the fastest that this league has ever seen . Period . " <p> For 12 years , Smith never missed a game , and until the 1997 season , when he was passed by A.C. Green , he was the NBA 's ironman , having played in 906 straight contests . He was one of the few players who traveled from Buffalo to San Diego with the franchise , when it became the Clippers . <p> He is the kind of player a team would be proud to call its own . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to know who Smith is . <p> Asked which former players come to mind , Brand answered : " Benoit Benjamin . Danny Manning . " He paused before recalling Norm Nixon . " He played with the Lakers , and played with the Clippers . " <p> Twenty-year-old Shaun Livingston , a guard for Los Angeles , mentioned McAdoo , but admitted not knowing much about the team 's history . " Last time they won a series , I was n't even born . " Even Dunleavy , who played against the very Buffalo teams that Smith played on , did not make the connection . <p> " I do n't spend much time on history , " he said . " Basically , this is a sport of the present and future . " To be fair , the franchise , rather than current players and coaches , seems largely to blame . <p> Smith has not been contacted by Los Angeles one time in the more than two decades since he set so many team records . He made efforts to get in touch with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past all-star game . Nothing came of it . <p> A Clippers spokesman declined when asked to comment about whether the team had made any effort to connect with past players . <p> " I 've even tried going back , because they were my team , " Smith said . " I would talk to a few people in management there , but to no avail . So I just stopped . " <p> Has Smith been surprised by Los Angeles 's lack of interest in him ? <p> " Totally , " he said . " I mean , it was my contention that you can never go anywhere unless you know where you 've been . Every team has a history . We moved , but you 'd think that the team or the city would go back and get all the history from where they came from , and obviously , blend that in . Because that 's education for the team , and plus , the players can identify with other players like Bob McAdoo and myself . Because we were good players , back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Famer McAdoo , a former NBA MVP and three-time scoring champion , is bitter about being overlooked . <p> More than anything , they see themselves as casualties of an unstable franchise , a place that until recently , Smith said , was " a graveyard for most of the young players coming out of college . " <p> " Only thing you can say is , ' Hey , that 's the way the ball bounces , ' " said McAdoo , who was honored this season with a halftime ceremony and commemorative Buffalo Braves jersey . ( His No. 11 remains active , however . ) Here , in the present , Smith is relishing the team 's success . <p> " The Clippers have been struggling for a long time , " he said . " It 's great to see that the team has turned around , and hopefully has some new direction now , and hopefully it can stay on top for a while . " <p> If Los Angeles called him , would he come to a game ? <p> " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start anything . As I said , I 'm a little disappointed because it should have happened years ago . " <p> A little later , Smith revealed how he really felt . <p> " I 'm looking forward to meeting them sometime down the road , " he said .
