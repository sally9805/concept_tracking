Chapter One Sarah Whenever Sarah thought back to that morning twelve years ago , she remembered the chick . She cracked open an egg , but instead of a yolk , a bloody chick embryo fell into the bowl . She stared at its alien eyes and gaping mouth , and the hair rose on her arms and neck . The maimed chick felt important somehow , a sign of how bleak and bad things had become . Sarah sensed that this was an omen , but she could n't imagine for what or how to prepare herself . The chick  --  in addition to giving Sarah second thoughts about buying free-range eggs at the local farmers ' market  --  made her remember the robin 's nest she 'd found the day before in the apple tree . There had been four eggs , pale and delicate , like the sugar-dough decorations on the wedding cakes she was known for . Sarah looked at the chick in the bowl and wanted to make sure the robin eggs were all right . She knew that this need was irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springtime in Ohio with the rain running in sheets down the window , and the robin certainly did n't require her assistance . Sarah knew she had more pressing things to focus on  --  she had to cater Thai red seafood curry for twelve today , she needed to start production on a wedding cake , and she was supposed to be developing recipes for a " salads as whole meals " spread for Food &; Wine , whose deadline was rapidly approaching . Sarah mentally inventoried these obligations , but she slipped out the back door anyway . She jogged across the sodden ground and stepped onto the bench under the tree . At the sight of Sarah 's gigantic head , the mother robin shrieked and fluttered to a higher branch . Sarah peered down at the nest , dry and cozy even in this downpour , and the eggs that , to her relief , still sat there like jewels . Four perfect eggs . Nothing but promise and potential ahead of them . She 'd once felt that way about her own family . The eggs and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been given in her grief support group two years ago , back when Roy , her husband , died . The counselor had told her to find three things each morning for which she felt grateful . The counselor told her not to count her two children  --  they were " givens . " The robin screeched at her in urgent , one-note cries , and Sarah tried to think of something that inspired gratitude . Weariness and regret weighed her down , but she stubbornly shoved them away . She could do it , damn it ; she could come up with three blessings . She scanned the yard , appraising it , as if it were a property she 'd never seen . She looked at the old sandbox the boys used to play in and at her garden , its recently tilled earth as dark as Black Forest cake . One of these days , if the rain ever stopped , she would plant . The mother robin hopped to a lower branch and continued the staccato warnings . Sarah felt bad prolonging the bird 's worry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , she reached for a branch , for balance , and in a flash the robin dove at her . Sarah jerked her hand away , but not before she felt the stab of beak and the surge of adrenaline at the attack . The robin flew one more swipe at Sarah before settling defiantly back onto her nest . Sarah examined the wound . A drop of blood welled on the back of her hand but washed away in the rain . More blood rose from the tiny puncture when she clenched her fist . The entire hand throbbed , and the slight pain felt almost good . This was pain from outside , not from within . And not only did her hand ache , but she shivered , aware of how wet and cold she was , skin tight with goose bumps , nipples erect . She felt something . She was alive . There . That was a blessing . She looked up at the tree , wanting to thank the bird for this sensation . This apple tree belonged to her younger son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted trees for both sons , in the ancient tradition that the branches from the trees would later be used for the chuppahs at their weddings . Danny used to be as sweet and cheerful as the tree 's early-April bloom , but a crab apple tree might have suited him better lately . He 'd changed . They 'd all changed . And Sarah did n't know how to stop it , how to go back to the family they 'd been before . Sarah walked across the yard , through the rain , to Nate 's dogwood tree and touched the trunk . This tree was planted nearly seventeen years ago . Now it stood taller than Nate . Thank God , Nate 's suspension from school was over  --  that would be the second blessing of the day . He 'd already been suspended twice this year for truancy ; once more and he 'd be expelled . Actually , this was the second for which he 'd been caught . She knew he 'd skipped more than that , because she 'd seen him in the middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grave at Temple Israel cemetery , she 'd been outraged to see someone sitting on Roy 's stone , smoking , but when she recognized Nate , she 'd slunk away before he saw her . She 'd never told him she 'd seen him there , never scolded him for cutting class . And from the cigarette butts that accumulated at the grave , she knew he went frequently . She never mentioned the butts , for fear he 'd cover his tracks , and she took comfort in knowing some small thing about his life . Plus , her approval of the visits might make him stop . Everything she said to Nate these days seemed only to insult and anger him . That 's why she was making his favorite burritos this morning . She hoped they could be a peace offering . The back door opened , and Nate stood at the screen . " What are you doing ? You 've been standing out there forever . " Continues ...                 @ @ @ @
