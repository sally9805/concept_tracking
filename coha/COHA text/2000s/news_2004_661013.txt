<p> An abusive stepfather , poor self-esteem , a drive to excel , a tendency to self-destruct . An affair that rocked a marriage - with America watching his every move . And , finally , therapy that , in his eyes , brought new insight , vitality , and peace . <p> With his new memoir , " My Life , " former President Bill Clinton has sprinkled his 900 pages with revelations from religious , marital , and family counseling - and brought America 's gaze , once again , to the growing role of psychotherapy in private lives and popular culture . <p> Unthinkable a few decades ago , Mr. Clinton 's talk of counseling , his " private struggle to hold the old demons at bay , " and the ways in which his unconscious shaped his life and presidency , is a barometer of just how widespread and acceptable therapy has become . <p> In some ways , Clinton is the ultimate emblem of an Age of Therapy - an era in which the rich and powerful , as well as the lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help . The phenomenon has been lionized in popular culture , from " The Sopranos " to Dr. Phil , and is giving rise to a whole new lexicon . Just think " closure . " <p> " It 's certainly a sign of where we 've come by the end of the 20th century , that these kinds of psychological variables are part of ... a politician 's self-disclosure , " says Stephen Hinshaw , chair of the psychology department at the University of California , Berkeley . " It 's revealing of just how psychology-minded we have become as a culture . " <p> To many , it 's a positive movement - a more honest reckoning with oneself and a more genuine approach to others . But not all of America is on board . To some , all those hours in an easy chair create problems where none exist - hence the pejorative term , " Woody Allen syndrome , " for the wealthy and neurotic who dash to psychologists over a lost toothbrush or a bad date . <p> There are vast cultural differences , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging through the past , warts , wounds , and all . Even therapy advocates worry that cultural forces popularizing it can " both present a reality and also trivialize and distort some of what we know about the mind 's workings , " according to Professor Hinshaw . <p> In politics , as in society at large , it was n't so long ago that any discussion of mental illness or depression was strictly taboo - or worse , a death knell for careers . Former President Nixon carefully hid the fact that he underwent psychoanalysis after his impeachment . In 1972 , Sen. Thomas Eagleton saw his spot as the vice-presidential candidate on George McGovern 's ticket demolished by revelations that he 'd had electric shock therapy . Even in 1988 , Democratic presidential contender Michael Dukakis fought rumors that his wife had been hospitalized for mental illness . <p> " What 's changed is that people who are high up , presidents , corporate officials , and others , now feel they can talk openly about their psychological difficulties and their willingness to go into therapy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State University of New York , Albany . " Until recently , it was seen as a sign of weakness ... Now , if anything , it 's seen as a sign of strength . " <p> Yes , detractors have criticized Clinton for minimizing personal failings , blaming them on his childhood , or portraying them as factors beyond his control . But the fact remains that Americans use therapy - and talk about it - more than ever . <p> According to a Harris Interactive survey released in May , some 27 percent of Americans - or 59 million people - have received mental-health treatment in the past two years . Although about half of them were treated solely with drugs , some 15 million went into therapy each year . <p> " A cynic would say the nation is becoming more screwy , " says Jo Colman , publisher of Pychology Today , which cosponsored the survey . " An optimist would say we 've always had these issues , but now more people are getting help . " Online , too , the therapy culture is booming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ directory of some 2,500 therapists . Launched a year and a half ago , the site gets 100,000 hits each month . <p> Experts trace the shift to several factors : the introduction of more effective antidepressants , which are often used in conjunction with counseling ; the availability of more therapists , especially in urban areas ; the willingness of many insurance companies to pay for certain types of counseling ; and a growing population of satisfied clients who talk about therapy 's benefits , thereby lessening its stigma and encouraging more people to go . <p> There are more subtle reasons , too , beyond the reach of drugs , HMOs , or water-cooler conversations . As American culture has grown more secular , Hinshaw says , the notion of mental illness as a sign of the devil 's grip has all but vanished . As neuroscience has advanced , a focus on flawed parenting has given way to discoveries of faulty genes - a movement , he cautions , that invokes its own stigmas , branding the sufferer with " bad wiring " and qualitative flaws . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness have transformed in the past decades . Though often lacking the nuance of real-life illness and treatment , they 've come a long way from the days of " Nightmare on Elm Street " to portrayals of depression and schizophrenia in " A Beautiful Mind , " the omnipresent Dr. Phil , or therapy sessions on " The Sopranos . " <p> That makes therapy not only more accessible , but acceptable to a far broader crowd . " If you see someone like fictional mob boss Tony Soprano being treated effectively , it carries the message that even tough guys can benefit , " says Danny Wedding , a clinical psychologist and director of the Missouri Institute of Mental Health . <p> Perhaps it was to be expected as the baby boomers aged and the angst-ridden generation of the 1980s drama " Thirtysomething " hit their midlife crises , had their own kids , and sent them to therapy , too . It 's a generational shift that features prominently in recent cultural criticism : Michael Barone 's new book , for example , " Hard America , Soft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competition and accountability , and a " soft " world that leans toward ( or on ) social safety nets . In the hard/soft scale , Clinton - who spent a year 's worth of weekly sessions with his wife following the revelations of his affair - may epitomize the soft baby boomer , while the first President Bush , straight from a generation of World War II veterans , emphasized the harder virtues of self-sufficiency and steely resilience . <p> But if that divide has changed and grown , and if attitudes toward therapy have shifted , so has therapy itself . The old emphasis on Freudian analysis and long-term treatment has faded : Now , for many , the approach is far more focused on behavioral strategies , sometimes eight sessions ' worth , rather than eight years . <p> The shift is partly driven by insurance companies demanding accountability and looking to lower their bills . But to many , it 's the pragmatism of a peculiarly American brand of therapy . " You go for a short period of time , you 're helped , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for all the change in attitudes , more serious mental illnesses often retain their stigma . Schizophrenia , for example , is hardly " in vogue , " Hinshaw points out . When attitudinal surveys ask people how close they 'd like to be to various groups , he adds , they put those with mental illness at the very bottom , comparable to rankings for people with leprosy a few generations ago . <p> " People who are stars or politicians or in the news are willing to talk about getting help , " he says . " The next step would be for such people to admit having schizophrenia or a bipolar disorder ... We 're still a long way away from that .
