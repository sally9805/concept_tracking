President-elect Barack Obama set out on Tuesday to reassure Americans that he intends to restrain spending despite the staggering bills for financial rescues and emergency government spending that seem to mount by the day . <p> " We are not going back to business as usual when it comes to our budget , " Obama said in naming Peter Orszag , director of the Congressional Budget Office , as his White House budget chief . " Budget reform is not an option . It 's a necessity . " <p> As bailouts and nasty economic news pile up , Obama has been putting flesh on the lofty but vague " change " mantra of his campaign with each appearance and appointment since his election . <p> For the liberal former senator from Illinois who seldom strayed from the party line , it turns out that change means a tough and deliberate pragmatism . <p> " This is n't about big government or small government , " Obama said . " It 's about building a smarter government that focuses on what works . " <p> With Orszag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over an ideologue or a political crony to fill a key economic position , stressing a " best and brightest " approach for his economic team . <p> Obama also named Rob Nabors , staff director of the House Appropriations Committee , as Orszag 's deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget . <p> Obama ' s idealism has n't disappeared . But rather than the sort that excited liberals and terrified conservatives during the campaign , it is a post-partisan idealism that Obama went out of his way to stress Tuesday by noting that his rival in the presidential campaign , Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz. , won 47 percent of the vote . <p> " Wisdom is not the monopoly of any party , " Obama said . " In order for us to be effective , given the scope and scale of the challenges we face , Republicans and Democrats are going to have to work together . And I think what the American people want more than anything is just common-sense , smart government . They do n't want ideology . They do n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action and they want effectiveness . " <p> Obama is facing the worst economic landscape since at least 1981 and possibly the worst since the Great Depression in the 1930s . The government said Tuesday that consumer spending plummeted over the summer by the largest amount in 28 years . <p> The economic crisis promises to consume Obama ' s presidency and define its success . And while providing opportunity to enact bold programs in the name of recovery , all the spending , both already undertaken and yet to come , will leave a monster budget hangover that could imperil future prosperity . <p> If Obama succeeds in leading the economy out of the recession in a way that minimizes the dangers of building a massive federal debt , he might be hailed as a savior . If he fails , he could be doomed to one term . <p> " You can not and you should not worry about deficits in the current environment , " said Stan Collender , a longtime budget expert and managing director at Qorvis Communications , a Washington public relations firm . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems is going to exacerbate the deficit to levels never before previously imagined , even by science fiction writers . " <p> There is wide agreement among economists that the times demand extraordinary measures . A deep recession could prove far more costly than government efforts to alleviate it , as tax revenues plummet and job losses mount . <p> " We 're going into the worst global recession for sure that that we 've ever seen , or seen since World War II , " said Simon Johnson , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund . " Are we going into something like the Great Depression ? Yeah , we could be , if they do n't act decisively and in the right direction . There 's a huge amount at stake here . " <p> At the same time , deficit projections for this fiscal year have already topped a breathtaking $1 trillion and with a large new fiscal stimulus could reach $1.5 trillion or more . That does n't count hundreds of billions of dollars in cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> On Monday and Tuesday alone , Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson announced another $20 billion injection in banking giant Citigroup , along with backing for more than $300 billion in toxic assets , and a new $800 billion program by the Federal Reserve to backstop mortgages , auto loans and other consumer debt . <p> Obama has not put a number yet on his stimulus plan , but it is estimated to be in the $500 billion range . Democrats in Congress are already pushing it to $700 billion and higher . <p> " We ca n't keep adding $100 billion to the intended stimulus every week , right , there is a limit , " Johnson said . He added that when he recommended a $450 billion stimulus package to the Senate Budget Committee just last week " there was a kind of a murmur , and now they 're talking , what , $800 billion ? " Such a sum would be difficult to spend effectively , he said . <p> Huge debts will hamstring Obama ' s other goals once the economy recovers . He began Tuesday to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm programs in the Senate , he cited a new Government Accountability Office report that 2,702 farmers earning more than $2.5 million a year nonetheless received $49 million in federal payments from 2003 to 2006 . Obama said such spending " is a prime example of the kind of waste that I intend to end as president . " <p> While advocating aggressive measures to arrest the economic decline , economists warned that these should not permanently expand government spending , which is already headed off a fiscal cliff with $66 trillion in unfunded commitments to entitlement programs , mainly Medicare but also Social Security , veterans benefits and other automatic payments to individuals . <p> Better , they said , are one-time capital investments that expand the nation 's productive capacity . They include such things as improving infrastructure or developing alternative energy sources . Obama cited investments in education to improve competitiveness and in health care to reduce long-term costs . <p> Sen. Judd Gregg , a New Hampshire Republican who played a big role in getting the $700 billion financial rescue passed and has been an ardent advocate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Obama is saying all the right things . <p> " The proof will be in the pudding , but at least in the choice of Peter Orszag they 've sent a fairly strong message by picking a guy who first understands the depth of the problem , and secondly has worked positively to take on the issues in entitlements , " Gregg said in an interview . " It 's good to have somebody of his stature and philosophy in that slot . You could have ended up with somebody who does n't care at all about this . He cares deeply about the long-term fiscal responsibility of the government . " <p> Find Documents with Similar Topics Help Below are concepts discussed in this document .
