Confederacy of Survivors Not long ago , down on Castro Street , a stranger in a Giants parka gave me a loaded glance as we passed each other in front of Cliff 's Hardware . He was close to my age , I guess , not that far past fifty-and not bad-looking either , in a beat-up , Bruce Willis-y sort of way-so I waited a moment before turning to see if he would go for a second look . He knew this old do-si-do as well as I did , and hit his mark perfectly . " Hey , " he called , " you 're supposed to be dead . " I gave him an off-kilter smile . " Guess I did n't get the memo . " His face grew redder as he approached . " Sorry , I just meant . . . it 's been a really long time and . . . sometimes you just assume . . . you know . . . " I did know . Here in our beloved Gayberry you can barely turn around without gazing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Having lost track of him in darker days , you had all but composed his obituary and scattered his ashes at sea , when he shows up in the housewares aisle at Cala Foods to tell you he 's been growing roses in Petaluma for the past decade . This happens to me a lot , these odd little supermarket resurrections , so I figured it could just as easily happen to someone else . But who the hell was he ? " You 're looking good , " hesaid pleasantly . " Thanks . You too . " His face had trenches like mine-the usual wasting from the meds . A fellow cigar store Indian . " You are Mike Tolliver , right ? " " Michael . Yeah . But I ca n't quite- " " Oh . . . sorry . " He thrust out his hand . " Ed Lyons . We met at Joe Dimitri 's after the second Gay Games . " That was no help at all , and it must have shown . " You know , " the guy offered gamely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . " The circle jerk ? " " Ah . " " We went back to my place afterward . " " On Potrero Hill ! " " You remember ! " What I remembered-all I remembered after nineteen years-was his dick . I remembered how its less-than-average length was made irrelevant by its girth . It was one of the thickest I 'd ever seen , with a head that flared like a caveman 's club . Remembering him was a good deal harder . Nineteen years is too long a time to remember a face . " We had fun , " I said , hoping that a friendly leer would make up for my phallocentric memory . " You had something to do with plants , did n't you ? " " Still do . " I showed him my dirty cuticles . " I had a nursery back then , but now I garden full time . " That seemed to excite him , because he tugged on the strap of my overalls and uttered a guttural " woof . " If he was angling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The green-collar job that had stoked his furnace had left me with some nasty twinges in my rotator cuffs , and I still had podocarps to prune in Glen Park . All I really wanted was an easy evening with Ben and the hot tub and a rare bacon cheeseburger from Burgermeister . Somehow he seemed to pick up on that . " You married these days ? " " Yeah . . . pretty much . " " Married married or just . . . regular ? " " You mean . . . did we go down to City Hall ? " " Yeah . " I told him we did . " Must 've been amazing , " he said . " Well , it was a mob scene , but . . . you know . . . pretty cool . " I was n't especially forthcoming , but I had told the story once too often and had usually failed to convey the oddball magic of that day : all those separate dreams coming true in a gilded , high-domed palace straight out of Beauty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ line of middle-aged people standing in the rain , some of them with kids in tow , waiting to affirm what they 'd already known for years . And the mayor himself , so young and handsome and . . . neat . . . that he actually looked like the man on top of a wedding cake . " Well , " said Ed Lyons , stranger no more , now that I 'd put a name to the penis . " I 'm heading down to the bagel shop . How ' bout you ? " I told him I was headed for my truck . " Woof ! " he exclaimed , aroused by the mere mention of my vehicle . I must 've rolled my eyes just a little . " What ? " he asked . " It 's not that butch a truck , " I told him . He laughed and charged off . As I watched his broad shoulders navigate the stream of pedestrians , I wondered if I would find Ed 's job-whatever it might be-as sexy as he found mine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make me want it , make me buy that two-bedroom condo ! That Century 21 blazer is so fucking hot ! I headed for my truck ( a light-blue Tacoma , if you must know ) , buzzing on a sort of homegrown euphoria that sweeps over me from time to time . After thirty years in the city , it 's nice to be reminded that I 'm still glad to be here , still glad to belong to this sweet confederacy of survivors , where men meet in front of the hardware store and talk of love and death and circle jerks as if they 're discussing the weather . It helps that I have Ben ; I know that . Some years back , when I was still single , the charm of the city was wearing thin for me . All those imperial dot-commers in their SUVs and Hummers barreling down the middle of Noe Street as if leading an assault on a Third World nation . And those freshly minted queens down at Badlands , wreathed in cigarette smoke and attitude , who seemed to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regular attendance at Queer as Folk night . Not to mention the traffic snarls and the fuck-you-all matre d 's and the small-town queers who brought their small-town fears to the Castro and tried to bar . . .
