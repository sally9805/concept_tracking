" . . . In the widening circle of global freedom , the U.S. must commit to taking the long view of its role in the world . That will require strong and imaginative leadership , coherent policies , and responsible politics and government . " HISTORIAN Arnold Toynbee wrote that the common characteristic of the world 's great civilizations has been the creative response to extraordinary challenge . He contended that civilizations " break down and go to pieces if and when a challenge confronts them which they fail to meet . " That historic cycle of challenge and response always has played to the strengths of the U.S. Today , however , the nation is in danger of failing to meet an extraordinary challenge . . . maintaining America 's competitive position in the world . Our nation is undermining its vital interests by not paying attention to the big issues . In Thomas L. Friedman 's book , The World Is Flat : A Brief History of the 21st Century , the author captures the new challenges facing the U.S. and its ability to compete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for more people than ever to collaborate and compete in real time with more other people on more different kinds of work from more different corners of the planet and on a more equal footing than at any previous time in the history of the world-using computers , e-mail , networks , teleconferencing , and dynamic new software . " The post-World War II Bretton Woods system , global trade regimes , and multilateral institutions helped lead the world into an age of prosperity . Decades of investment in geopolitical security , economic stability , innovation , and productivity have resulted in a 21st century diffusion of economic power . Today , there is no great competition to paralyze world politics like during the Cold War ; nations across the globe are reforming and opening their markets ; and the explosion of scientific discovery and new technology is changing every aspect of our lives . The scale and rate of this change and global competitiveness is increasing faster than the ability to calibrate it or adjust to it . Just 20 years ago , China , Russia , Eastern Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . World exports went from $58,000,000,000 in 1948 to almost six trillion dollars in 2001 . Tariffs dropped from an average of 40% to four percent in the same period . Standards of living rose wherever barriers to trade and commerce fell and investments in education and research and development grew . Technology has spread throughout the world . This confluence of progress is unprecedented . Meeting the challenge of maintaining the U.S. 's competitive position will require leadership that is capable of creating a national consensus , as well as prioritizing our interests and a clear evaluation of our inventory of challenges and plans to fix them . Deficit spending , health care , energy , entitlements , education , savings , trade , immigration , and infrastructure all are difficult and complicated issues that will affect the future of our country and our competitive edge in the world . If the U.S. is to succeed , our political system can not continue to bog down in the mire of partisan gamesmanship , appealing to the lowest political common denominator on issue after issue . The race to win the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claim victory at any cost has squeezed out our ability to see beyond the immediate to the larger historically defining challenges of our time . We too often have allowed government policies and our democracy to become captive to marginalized politics , paralyzing the very system that has helped the country prosper . This especially is dangerous because today 's issues are so large and complicated that there is little margin for error in addressing them . Leaders must stop this zero-sum game of political destruction . Institutions can not function without the essential currencies of trust and confidence . We must work to build back that trust and confidence or we will be incapable of any bipartisan effort to provide solutions . Well-financed and well-organized special interests that threaten , bludgeon , and intimidate increasingly are playing dominant roles in setting the U.S. 's agenda and priorities . Elected leaders must show courage in fulfilling their constitutional responsibilities for protecting the general interests of our country and citizens . Who lobbies for the general good of America ? Who is looking over the horizon and seeing large economic storm clouds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to govern ? Governing requires making tough choices , looking at the big picture , and developing a consensus of purpose . There always will be a legitimate debate over the role of government . This is critically important for the vitality and validity of a democracy . However , that debate must be held in an environment that moves the nation toward a purpose of progress and achievement . Respect for other 's opinions , tolerance , fairness , and listening are the building blocks for consensus . We will fail our nation if we carelessly and unwisely stay on this current path of political paralysis and destruction . The next generation will bear a heavy burden and pay a high price for this historic failure . I believe that the citizenry will not allow this to happen . Americans will demand that leaders address their concerns and the nation 's challenges . These difficult new issues will require consensus , creative thinking , and committed leadership . A bipartisan agreement to get control of our runaway spending is the first priority for the president and Congress . Our budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.S. can not sustain the current spending trajectory that it is now on . It will weaken our country , diminish our economy , and result in a very uncertain future for our children . The Fiscal Year 2005 Federal budget deficit is in the $400,000,000,000 range . The Congressional Budget Office projects that 62% of Fiscal Year 2006 's $2.4 trillion budget will be obligated to mandatory spending . That number will rise to 64% in FY2007 . Most of that amount is mandated for entitlement programs-Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid . Moreover , $177,000,000,000 of our mandatory spending is for interest on our national debt . Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan has warned the Senate Budget Committee that the Federal budget is on an " unsustainable path . " He cautions that , " At some point , these deficits would cause the economy to stagnate-or worse . " // Moreover , former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin observes , " Almost all economists agree that sustained deficits will crowd out private investment , increase interest rates , reduce productivity , and reduce growth . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose confidence , we will be headed for a crisis . He further notes , " A sound fiscal policy , which can engender confidence in U.S. economic policy and the long-term prospects for our economy , is the best antidote . " Our spending habits are adding up . The Federal debt is more than 38% of gross domestic product . According to former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker , " What holds it all together is a massive and increasing flow of capital from abroad , running to more than $2,000,000,000 every working day-and growing . " Fifty-three percent of our publicly held debt is in the hands of foreign investors-half of that by Japan and China . While it is in their interests to continue to lend us this money , we are putting an immense amount of leverage in the hands of these governments . This also is a matter of national security . We can not be assured of political and economic stability in these nations , and risk whether they will continue to invest in an American economy with a government unable to impose any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts deficit is almost $666,000,000,000-nearly six percent of GDP . America is losing market share in all sectors of trade , and there is a dangerous protectionist streak developing in both political parties . Trade has been the engine of growth , innovation , wealth , and job creation for the U.S. and the world since World War II . Staying competitive in a global economy requires maintaining America 's leadership in free trade . Trade is not a guarantee-it is an opportunity . It clearly is in the U.S. 's interest to strengthen its commitment to free and fair trade . That means supporting multilateral institutions such as the World Trade Organization and initiating free trade agreements . As the Fed Chairman cautions , " Protectionism , some signs of which have emerged in recent years , could significantly erode global flexibility and , hence , undermine the global adjustment process . " The U.S. 's current accounts deficit , however , is a challenge too big and persistent for a gradual market correction . Volcker maintains that , " as a nation , we are consuming and investing about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This seemingly comfortable pattern ca n't go on indefinitely . " Our continued deficit spending is being compounded by an aging population . The U.S. currently has an unfunded entitlements liability of 44 trillion dollars . We have no idea where we are going to get that money to meet future obligations . As columnist Robert Samuleson relates , " We 're mortgaging workers " future pay gains for baby boomers ' retirement benefits . " The report of the Social security and Medicare Trustees demonstrates that , by 2030 , the estimated costs of those programs alone easily could consume one-third of future workers ' wage and salary increases . Social Security is not in crisis now , but we need to respond to the underlying structural problems before it gets to that point . Pres. George W. Bush is right with his urgent focus on reforming Social security . In March , I introduced the first comprehensive Social Security reform bill in the Senate . Medicare and Medicaid soon will be in trouble if they are not reformed . We must deal with these challenges now so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing in a far more competitive world than exists today . To leave future generations in this predicament would be an irresponsible and colossal failure . There are other obligations that are bearing down on us as well . When the American Society of Civil Engineers issued its annual report card , it gave our national infrastructure a grade of D. It estimated that more than 27% of the nation 's bridges are deficient or obsolete and that the commuters spend some 46 hours a year stuck in traffic . The power blackout that hit the Northeast , Midwest , and Canada in 2003 was a serious warning that our electric power grid is severely outdated . This is a systemic problem for all publicly regulated and maintained utilities and infrastructures . These deficiencies will erode our global competitiveness further , but with the Federal budget so committed to mandatory spending , it is unclear how we are going to deal with this challenge as we fall further and further behind in addressing these situations . We need to think creatively . Capital accounts budgeting , for example , is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United Kingdom to bring more accountability and reality to government spending and investment in public infrastructure . We need to explore these kinds of new initiatives . Last year , U.S. companies reported to the Department of Commerce that , by 2010 , as much as 90% of their research and development and manufacturing could shift to places such as China and India . The reason ? They are having difficulty finding a qualified American workforce . Friedman says the problem boils down to three " gaps " - ambition , education , and numbers . I believe he is right . Our schools are not turning out enough motivated students with the skills that will prepare them for tomorrow 's global challenges . A competitive 21stcentury workforce must have the education to understand the complexity of today 's markets and the training to stay on the leading edge of a competitive world . The Council on Competitiveness has concluded that U.S. students are better at math and science than most of their peers in other advanced nations in the fourth grade , but are not competitive by the 12th grade . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in engineering , math , and science . In 2002 , 58% of all degrees awarded in China were in engineering and physical sciences ; in the U.S. , 17% . Shirley Ann Jackson , president of the American Association for the Advancement of Science , calls this a " quiet crisis . " One that could " jeopardize the nation 's preeminence and well-being . " For leaders , that means we must be out there , visiting schools and students , seeing for ourselves what is happening and underscoring the importance of a good education . We must ensure that the necessary resources are available , including inspired teachers and incentives for change and new initiatives . As leaders and parents , we need to be paying attention and sending a message that education is a lifelong endeavor . Everyone who has lost a job in the new global economy knows this . Protectionist measures will not save jobs ; enhanced skill levels and the education to qualify for these 21st century positions is the real response to this challenge . In addition to the growing gap in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the quantity of workers . With falling birthrates , it will be increasingly difficult to fill available jobs in this country . Adding to the size of our workforce through immigration historically has given the economy and society a positive boost . Today , however , the U.S. unintentionally is working against its own interests with a contradictory and punitive immigration policy that makes no sense . Obviously , border restrictions are critically important for our national security . However , with our current stance , we are saying , " not welcome " to students , professionals , workers , and others of the world 's next generation-and with limited improvement to the security of our borders . Rule of law , labor , capital , natural resources , and the free market all are basic elements of our flexible economy . However , there also is a large intangible that has been a core building block for our prosperity and security , and that is the U.S. 's leadership in the world . We have brought together friends and allies in common cause , addressing common challenges with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Today , though , we widely are perceived as turning away from that successful post-World War II multilateral approach . If this world perception becomes permanent in the eyes of a new global generation , it will be very difficult for our nation to stay secure and competitive . We will become isolated in a complicated and dangerous world . American leadership is a heavy burden , and one that will give us no quarter in the coming years . Yet , it also is a tremendous opportunity . It will require an enlightened foreign policy of principled realism that remains true to our highest ideals and seeks to build coalitions and strengthen alliances . We have no other course , if for no other reason than we will be economically , militarily , and diplomatically incapable of sustaining unilateral policies . If the world believes the U.S. is inclined to go it alone and is absorbed with its own purpose , then we are less likely to get the international cooperation and support we need for important global objectives and actions . A renewed commitment to public diplomacy will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken hold all over the world . Pres. Bush has said he is committed to this and the Congress strongly will support his efforts and leadership . However , it will be the U.S. 's deeds and policies-rather than its words-by which the success of this effort will be measured in the eyes of the world . While a lack of international support will affect the U.S. 's ability to achieve foreign policy goals , it also will add burdens to the economy . Acting as the world 's policeman is costly ; it means spending hundreds of billions of dollars that will not be available to support infrastructure , education , research and development , health care , and other national priorities . It means investing human capital in police and military work around the world . For the U.S. to remain globally competitive , it must balance its responsibilities , resources , relationships , and priorities . U.S. foreign policy must inspire trust in America 's purpose . During World War II and the Cold War , there was little question as to which power represented hope and offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living through a dynamic global generational shift . This new generation does not see the world and the U.S. role in it the same way as its parents . We are losing the battle for hearts and minds across the globe , especially in the Islamic world . That means the U.S. could lose the future . The world needs to see a 21st century American purpose worthy of its 21st century power . The U.S. is not the only nation with burdens and challenges . Nations of Europe and Japan are facing aging populations , low birthrates , high-cost programs , and other governmental , societal , and economic challenges . We acutely are aware of the explosive economic growth of India and China , but they too have heavy loads to carry . India has a fast-rising middle class , estimated to be more than 200,000,000 people , but it also has more than 300,000,000 individuals below a very low poverty line . China has a similar population challenge , as well as an authoritarian political system that fundamentally is incompatible with its booming economy . All nations inventory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strengths is its flexible economy . That flexibility thrives in a dynamic society . It does set America apart from other nations . We recall in the 1980s the fears about Japan 's economy , productivity , and disciplined structure dominating the U.S. As MIT scholar Richard Lester notes , " At the beginning of that decade , America 's industries were widely thought to be in decline . Yet , by the end of the 1990s , not only had the U.S. economy recovered , but it was unarguably the strongest in the world . " The laws of " comparative advantage " and " supply and demand " always will prevail . The U.S. tends to forget the consequences of those laws or ignore them . They need to be reinserted into the nation 's global economic thinking and policymaking . When the U.S. has required the best from its people , it has harnessed the vitality and innovation of the private sector with the structure and power of government to form publicprivate partnerships . The World War II Manhattan Project and the recent intelligence review commissions are two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Project-type commission should be established to address our long-term energy challenges . The president and Congress should come together and develop these partnerships by structuring panels to assess , analyze , and provide recommendations on how we can fix our long-term problems . Prs . Bush has empaneled a Tax Reform Commission , but I believe we must go further . Tax reform is just one element of government policy that affects our economy . National Entitlements and Health Care commissions should be established to assist the president and Congress with the difficult reform decisions that will be required to keep entitlement programs solvent and health care advancing , accessible , and affordable . A wider and deeper review of these problems will be required to evaluate them legitimately and recommend integrated , complete-picture solutions to fix them . We can not correct long-term economic difficulties by adjusting or changing only one or two components of the economy . We must seek to lower the cost of how Americans operate and compete in the world . A complete review of government regulation is long overdue in all economic sectors . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that should not make us complacent . We will need every fiber of that adaptability to maintain our competitive advantage in this new and developing global economy . Economic power is the one power that allows a nation flexibility , options , and opportunities . It supports all other powers ; it is the power base of a nation . Former General Electric CEO Jack Welch once said that , " If the rate of change on the outside exceeds the rate of change on the inside , the end is near . " That applies to nations as well as businesses . The new global economy , which this country has done so much to build , is both a challenge and an opportunity to our civilization . Now , we must respond , just as Toynbee observed . The dynamism produced from a free society is the engine of all change . It is part of America 's culture . It is who we are . In his State of the Union address in 1990 , Pres. George H.W. Bush proclaimed : " America , not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people , everywhere . As this new world takes shape , America stands at the center of a widening circle of freedom : today , tomorrow , and into the next century . . . . But dreams alone wo n't get us there . We need to extend our horizon , to commit to the long view . " Fifteen years later , those words ring like a Churchillian gong with new urgency and meaning . Today , in the widening circle of global freedom , the U.S. must commit to taking the long view of its role in the world . That will require strong and imaginative leadership , coherent policies , and responsible politics and government . My generation has enjoyed 60 years of expanding prosperity , security , and national prestige . This was a legacy passed on to us by our parents and every generation of Americans . We owe it to them and to our children to pass on an enhanced inheritance to future generations . This is the 21st-century Toynbee challenge .
