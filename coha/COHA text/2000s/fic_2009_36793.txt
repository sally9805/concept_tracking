It was the kind of day when even the lost believed . When possibilities were larger than reason , when potential was grander than circumstance , when the long , dark days of doubt were suddenly cast off and laid to rest . Brushed away with a smile and a certainty . And in this moment , from this place , you knew the real magic could happen . <br> It was exactly this kind of day at the edge of a town in a southern place called Echo , Florida . Lying safely on the state 's northern border , Echo was first brethren more to its Alabama cousin than to the Gulf Coast . The land rolled by in rural peace and contentment , not given over to the moods of saltwater tides and open horizons but to the soft singing of wind in the pines , of roosters calling in the early morning light , of small cornfields and freshwater fishing holes . <br> The firstborn leaves of March had sprouted into the tiniest sea of baby green . The world was breathing in and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on due course , with a gentle , four-edges-of-the-earth kiss . The birds had filled the trees , rumbling from their winter 's sleep , and here they were now , glorious and in full song . Squirrels scampered , quick and unseen , beneath banks of dried loblolly pine needles , then ran up the trees so fast they left nothing but a trail of falling bark . <br> Down at the edge of the powdery dirt road was Mullet Creek , running quietly , steadily throwing off stars of light <br> from its surface . You could hear the airborne fish breaking the bonds of water , then falling with a plop back into the chilly green of the creek . <br> Within all the living things  --  the dirt , the water , the cloudless sky , the pine trees long and whispering  --  was the <br> expectation of something coming . Something full of light and wonder . <br> When the expectation had stretched as far as it could , had built a crescendo into a feverish pitch , a peculiar wind <br> appeared . Only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something delicious and unique . A whirl began to take shape , collecting dirt from the dry bed of the middle of the road and spreading it upward into a spiraling funnel of substance . For a moment it appeared to be an errant breeze that caught the dirt and gave it a twirl , a bit of a dance , before it would settle itself to the nothing it once was . But the dance did n't settle . Instead , it climbed higher and higher , pulling a streamof sandy soil , twisting it to and fro , as if something was shaping it with a manner of something in mind . <br> At first , there was only the wind , the dust , the dirt , but then , shifting in and out of visible , were two well-worn and traveled boots . <br> The dirt traveled higher , faster , revealing two trousered legs and then a waist , a chest , two arms with hands , until finally a head and on that head , a hat well lived in.The image presented a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> For a time the man and the whirlwind were one and the same . Man and whirlwind . Whirlwind and man . But after a long moment , but still only a moment , the man stepped straight out of that wind , and without the least bit of tussle he planted his boots on solid ground . And in this exact manner , on this kind of a day , the man was born feetfirst onto the earth . <br> He adjusted himself , pulling the clothes about his body , arranging the pants , the shirt , the jacket just so.He was a million miles roamed and completely at home . King to the subjects who might demand , but simple statesman to the orphan clan . <br> He removed the hat and ran one hand through his thick white hair and surveyed the territory before him . Then , after careful and appropriate consideration , he replaced the hat and pulled a watch from the left pocket of his pants . He opened the cover and music began to play . Music so sweet , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each note and left it hanging there in the air . " Right on time , " he declared aloud and then launched himself forward in a southern direction on the road that had given him life . <br> He traveled only a rock 's throw toward the creek , and there just before the edge of the trees thatmade up a plot considered the woods , he paused and contemplated a house . Just a small white house of little consequence . A small shelter from the storms of life . There was an old mailbox by the road on which a yellow vine crawled and encircled its wooden post . Green bushes bloomed with early white gardenias on both sides of a little porch where there was a swing . In the swing sat a small hen of a woman . <br> The man drew closer , almost but not quite visible , as he watched her from the north side of the pine tree woods . <br> The woman stood slowly and went to the porch railing , leaned out as far as she could , and peered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrapped her arms about herself . She pursed her lips , pulled them up to one side , listening to that spring breeze singing through the pine needles and thinking . <br> Then she spoke to her husband , dead now a year . It was an odd , comforting habit she 'd taken up . It kept her lonely voice from rusting . <br> " Did you feel that ? That shift in the air ? Well , what can I tell you , Joe ? It changed . It was one way , then it was another . " <br> She paused , looked out toward the tree line . " And somebody 's out there standing just beyond the trees . " She called out , " Who goes there ? " and waited amoment for a reply.There was no answer , but that did n't move her . She was certain that she was right.That someone was watching , waiting just beyond her line of sight . <br> Continues ...                 @ @ @ @
