Australia 's Anglican leader urges acceptance of gay relationships <p> PERTH , Australia ( AP ) - The new head of the Anglican Church of Australia has said Christians should treat same-sex relationships as " committed friendships , " but stopped just short of openly condoning gay marriages . <p> Archbishop Peter Carnley wrote in the Bulletin magazine that same-sex relationships would be less likely to fail if the church accepted them . He said that , in the future , acceptance might include allowing homosexual couples to seek formal church approval through ceremonies similar to marriage . <p> In Carnley 's opinion , the Bible has no clear teachings about homosexual behavior and the few mentions appear to target promiscuity . He said the church should focus on the homosexual friendships as vehicles for " love , joy , peace , forgiveness , gentleness , mutual respect , care and steadfast loyalty .

Under the proposed change , First Baptist would grant full membership to transfers while requiring immersion only for those undergoing first-time baptisms . <p> Baptism " is not a prerequisite of salvation , " said the church 's minister for pastoral care , Donna Forrester , " so what 's most important is the faith response .
