The analysis covers Year 1 ( January 1998-June 1999 ) and Year 2 ( July 1999-June 2000 ) of the program , and results indicate that most non-BIA ( Bureau of Indian Affairs ) schools serving American Indians applied for the E-Rate program .

BIA schools greatly increased their E-Rate use between Years 1 and 2 , and all BIA applicants were funded . Total commitment to BIA schools in Year 2 topped $6 million .
