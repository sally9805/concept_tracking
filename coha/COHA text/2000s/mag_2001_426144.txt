IT TOOK 100 YEARS TO CONNECT THE FIRST BILLION PEOPLE BY PHONE AND ONLY 10 YEARS TO CONNECT THE SECOND BILLION . // Little orange flags have sprouted along the sidewalks in Bethesda , a Maryland suburb just over the line from Washington , D.C. I have seen seen enough of these flags to know that they fly for the diggers . Someday soon the diggers and their backhoes and their flashing warning lights will arrive to tear up the roads and slow down traffic so they can bury something . But what ? Not far from my home I caught up with Martin J. Droney , who was running a crew of telephone company workers . Martin introduced me to the rewiring of the world . It is a world of cables buried on land and in seabeds , a world of cascading e-mail messages and a burgeoning Internet , doubling in size every year , spewing information on a scale unprecedented in history . And it is a world with a " digital divide " that separates the connected people from people so unconnected that hundreds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call . Those orange flags mark the trails of fiberoptic diggers . " Orange means communications - fiber- optic these days , " Martin said . This morning the crew was stringing , not digging . Fiber-optic cable would go overhead on utility poles for a stretch and then dive underground , joining my phone company 's eight-millionmile nationwide fiber-optic network . The pencil-thin cable spins off its reel and flows into a black duct stiff enough to provide a pathway , whether the cable goes aerial or into the ground . It contains dozens of glass fibers , each thinner than a human hair . They are called dark fibers until they go to work , transmitting pulses of laser-generated light . Carried within the light are digitized voices , videos , computer signals , or anything else that can be made of bits . Each fiber can itself become a tiny cable capable of hauling even more signals . The capacity of a fiber is measured in the number of bits sent per second . Megabit ( a million bits ) defined the capacity of early fiber-optic cables . Next ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , and now comes terabit ( a trillion ) . The latest transatlantic cable is rated at 2.4 terabits . In one second , that cable can transmit a hundred hours of digital video or 30 million phone calls across the Atlantic . An estimated 35 million miles of fiber lace America . But some 90 percent of the land cables are dark . Telecommunications executives , swept along by the booming Internet , vastly overestimated demand . Martin sketched a diagram to show how my home phone 's copper wire has to go through various telephone-system way stations before it reaches the kind of fiber-optic cable his crew was installing . If I make a call to , say , London , my connection might be through the Fiberoptic Link Around the Globe ( FLAG ) , a 51,600-mile network that stretches from its London base to the rest of the world . Until a few years ago my call probably would have gone to London via satellite . Now satellites orbit an Earth whose nations are increasingly tied together by submarine cables . To trace the likely path @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train and taxi reached a little Cornwall town named Porthcurno , at Land 's End , the westernmost tip of England . Cables have been rising from the sea here since the Victorian age , when words of commerce , diplomacy , and war poured in and out of Porthcurno , the cable capital of the British Empire . Today the new 2.4-terabit Atlantic cable passes invisibly from a tranquil bay to a trench beneath a patched , gorse-lined Porthcurno lane . Entrenched cables carry the transatlantic traffic along roads and highways to London , where it enters what is commonly called a " telehouse . " Links between cable and consumer , telehouses have popped up in cities throughout the world , coddling cables with air-conditioning , protecting them with high-tech security , and connecting them to local networks . London 's Telehouse Docklands is a gleaming six-story building on Coriander Avenue . Nearby streets are named Oregano , Rosemary , and Nutmeg , recalling the days when these were the spice docks . To get in , I had to consent to a physical search and pass through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vincent Alder , I entered a building that had few people , much space , some metal boxes sprouting colored wires , and rows of empty racks waiting for more " magic boxes , " as Vincent calls themthe servers , routers , and other equipment needed for the Internet . " It 's like watching a supernova , " Vincent said , his hands sweeping through the emptiness . " No one knows how it 's going to end . " The first wiring of the world began in 1850 , only six years after Samuel Morse demonstrated the reality of telegraphy . British engineers made a copper-wire cable , insulated it with gutta-percha ( a rubberlike Malayan tree sap ) , and laid it across the English Channel . Soon came a cable across the Atlantic . On August 16,1858 , Queen Victoria sent a hundred  --  word message to President James Buchanan . Some of the royal words reached Washington that day ; the rest came through on the 17th . Agonizingly slow and chronically unreliable , the cable went dead after three weeks . The problem was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had found the solution , engineers tried again , this time with the world 's largest ship , the Great Eastern . In July 1865 she set out from England with a crew of 500 , a dozen oxen for hauling , a cow for fresh milk , a herd of pigs for bacon-and a thickly insulated 2,800-mile cable that weighed 5,000 tons . They had almost finished laying it when the cable snapped . The next year they succeeded . Cable laying continued through the 19th century and into the 20th . Words were humming along at more than 200 a minute , compared with 12 a minute in 1866 . But cable met competition when wireless telegraphs , in 1901 , and commercial telephone calls , in 1927 , began crackling across the Atlantic on radio waves . Not until 1956 did a telephone cable span the Atlantic . Then in 1965 the first Early Bird Satellite went into orbit , and again cable became a has-been . But by the mid-1990s , thanks to fiber optics , cable was making a comeback , carrying most telephone calls between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pulsing with Internet data packets , cables connect more than 80 nations , carrying far more telephone calls than satellites or mobile phones . But those mobile phones and satellites are bridging the digital divide , using wireless networks as a way to connect the unconnected . Maps of the rewired world vividly show the divide . One wide swath , from North America to Europe , is dense with communications , while vast areas , such as the African and South American continents , are blank . When the connected world reaches those blank spots , the people in them begin to prosper , says Vinod Thomas , vice president of the World Bank Institute , created in 1999 to serve as a knowledge bank for developing countries . He handed me a chart that compared South Korea and Ghana , which both had about the same level of poverty in 1962 . Then , while the average income level stagnated in Ghana , South Korea 's income started to soar , aided by that nation 's investment in communications . " Distance learning , " through satellitebeamed videoconferences @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Virtual University , for example , has a faculty of North American and European professors whose lectures are televised and sent to students in 16 African countries . The virtual university also offers computer courses to African teachers lucky enough to have computers in their classrooms . I did a little distance learning myself in a World Bank Institute videoconference classroom . Through its satellite network the institute connects learning centers in some 30 countries . Discussions range from health care to preventing corruption . I looked at myself projected on a large screen , along with squares occupied by images of African entrepreneurs who run computer centers in Senegal , Cote d'Ivoire , and Ghana . The centers serve as paths to the connected world 's information highway . People get their first look at the Internet , send their first e-mails ( Gregory looks for lost relatives ) , speak up in chat rooms ( " .. I did n't come here to bandy words with you " ) , and learn how to sign up for distance-learning university courses . Many countries , such as China and Brazil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationwide telephone lines by leapfrogging over copper wire and setting up cellular phone systems . Shanghai , for instance , with a population of 17 million , has more than 3 million mobile phone users . It took a hundred years to connect a billion people by wire . It has taken only ten years to connect the next billion people . The Internet gave cable a new set of customers . A round-trip satellite signal takes a quarter of a second , an endurable delay during a phone conversation . But for the connected on the Internet , delay is intolerable and time is measured in nanoseconds . Internet facts and foibles move along fiber-optic cables at nearly the speed of light . The Internet seems to be neither here nor there . In the rewired world , as hackers say , the world is one big wire , and distance is dead . * MORE ON OUR WEBSITE Connect to our forum on connecting the world at nationalgeographic.com/ ngm/0112 .
