<p> BOURBONNAIS , Ill.  --  Bears running back Thomas Jones can be as elusive off the field as on it . <p> Chances are you can find him in the weight room most days , before and after practice . Or you can find him breaking down film in the running backs ' meeting room at Halas Hall . Jones keeps his own counsel and rarely reveals his inner feelings . <p> He 's one of the most underrated players on this or any Bears team . The New York Giants ' Tiki Barber is the only NFL player who has produced a larger percentage of his team 's offense over the last two seasons . Last year , Jones became the only Bears running back other than Walter Payton to eclipse 1,300 yards in a season , pulling off the feat against eight- and nine-man fronts designed to stop him . <p> Jones is entering the third year of a four-year , $10.5 million deal and lost his starting job to Cedric Benson , ostensibly because Jones did n't show up for the offseason workout program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allowing others to lay out the case of why he should be starting , Jones gave an exclusive interview to the Sun-Times this week in which he revealed his love of the Bears , his desire to remain the starter and his belief that the so-called running back battle has been " ridiculous " and " a distraction to my team . " <p> Q. There is an old adage in the NFL that you do n't lose your job to injury , which apparently means you should n't be the starter when Cedric Benson returns from his shoulder injury . But how do you lose your job in the offseason ? <p> A. I did n't do anything to lose my job . I did n't come to the offseason program because I chose to work out with my own trainer . Then I come back for minicamp , and I 'm running with the second team . You lose your job by performance . You do n't lose your job by not showing up for the offseason program . Coaches make decisions based on what they think , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? <p> A. No , not really . I showed up , and I was running with the second team . Well , with the first team and the second team , but Cedric was going first . It was n't really explained to me . It was just like , I was n't there in the offseason program , and he felt like he had to do something as far as rewarding the guys who were there . <p> Q. Did you find that strange ? <p> A. It 's weird because in my position for the last two years , I feel like I have been a very important part of the offense and the team . I 've earned my stripes  --  not only in this league , but definitely in Chicago with this team . To me , if you lose your job because you decided to work out with someone else to get better for the team , that 's something I do n't understand . But that 's not my decision . Lovie made the decision . I 've never been the kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a coach or a teammate . <p> Q. You have been a loyal teammate . Is it hard to keep that up ? <p> A. I love being here in Chicago . It 's a great city , great fans , great football city , just a great place to play football . I try to worry about what I can control . My mind-set is that I am a starting NFL running back , whether I am on the Chicago Bears or any other team . I know the offense . I know the game . I am experienced . I am smart on the field and off the field . I work really hard in the offseason . I work really hard during the season trying to take care of my body . I am a starter in the NFL . My numbers say that . <p> Q. You rushed for 1,335 yards last year . What should that say for your status on this team ? <p> A. In my eyes , I am no different than Olin Kreutz or Brian Urlacher or Wale Ogunleye . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the core players here , and I feel I have proven that over the last two years . I 'm not the kind of guy that is going to come out and say something bad about coaches or other running backs . I come out here and do what I am asked to do and let things happen the way they happen . Of course , you ca n't come out and say everything you want to . I 'll just make sure I am ready . <p> Q. Why is it that Rex Grossman is n't competing for a job but you are ? Is there a hypocrisy in that ? Should n't everybody who has a job either keep his job or compete for his job ? <p> A. Obviously , you know a lot of reasons for that . I do n't like to say anything . I just know you do n't lose your job because you did n't come to an offseason program , especially me . I am a workout warrior . I work out every day . I work out on Saturdays and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of my body , and No. 2 , it 's going to make me the best football player I can be and last the whole season . <p> So I 'm not here for the offseason program  --  which is voluntary ; it 's not mandatory . The team is here , granted . But I felt like I would benefit more by working out with my own trainer . Meanwhile , I come back in the best shape you can possibly be in , and I 'm told I lost my job . You do n't lose your job because you did n't show up for a voluntary program . I say that over and over because it just baffles me sometimes that people do n't understand that . You do n't lose your job because you do n't show up to an offseason program , especially after the good production . <p> Q. No one knows why you were upset in the offseason . Did anyone say anything to you about having to battle for your job with Benson ? Did you want a trade ? Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they feel like are best for the team . It 's sort of a messed-up league because one minute you sign a contract , yeah , but you are outplaying the contract . You are playing like one of the top guys in the league , but you are not getting paid for what you are doing . It 's frustrating for the player , but at the same time , a guy will play really good and he 'll deserve a roster bonus in his contract , but they will cut him because they wo n't play him . It 's definitely not a system set up for the players . <p> Q. Is it a flaw in the system that rookies drafted in the top 10 command more money than proven players , and then teams are forced to get them on the field to justify the pick ? <p> A. It 's tough how it 's set up , but that is something as players we ca n't control . We just have to hope the organization respects your work , respects your effort and pays you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that I am a starting running back regardless of what else might be going on . I do n't get into saying anything about Cedric . He did what he had to do to get drafted . I 'm a guy who has been around and knows the offense . <p> Q. Do you feel the Bears have been disloyal to you ? <p> A. I feel like by being here , I finally had an opportunity to do what I was supposed to do in Arizona . People who do n't play the game do n't understand how hard it is when you do n't have a passing game and the defense is game-planning to stop you . It 's tough because the whole game there are not going to be holes because the offensive line ca n't block everybody . My first year we went through four different starting quarterbacks . If defenses do n't respect the receivers , then they are not going to back up . I do n't have an opportunity to make a lot of guys miss because they are on me whenever I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start making plays . And then game in and game out , you are the only guy really making plays . The next year they bring another guy in as if you are not the answer , and you were really the only bright spot that whole season . But that is the NFL . It 's a business . They have their own agenda and what they feel they have to do . Then last year , I went through what I had to go through to get some yards . <p> Q. It was said the Bears brought you in because of your cutback skills . The St. Louis Rams wanted you , too , as a replacement for Marshall Faulk because they believed you were perfect for that style of offense . When that offense failed here and Terry Shea was run out , maybe it made sense to draft a power runner for Ron Turner 's scheme . Could it have been as simple as that ? <p> A. I feel like I can be in any offense and run it . I can run outside or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass . You can line me up in the slot and you put me one-on-one against a linebacker , and nine times out of 10 , I make that play . You can line me out wide , and I 'll run any route a receiver can run . Once you get labeled , it 's kind of hard . People like to label guys , but in the end , it 's football . I can understand Warrick Dunn is not a power back . He 's 180 pounds . I 'm 215 pounds . <p> Q. You have n't done much talking , but Cedric said from Day 1 it was going to be his job . Did it bother you that he was predicting he 'd take your job nearly from the moment he signed ? <p> A. Honestly , that 's something I do n't even want to get into . Cedric is a young guy . To me , it 's simple : You do n't produce the way I have produced and be an integral part of this team and a good teammate and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a starter ? Why ? I try not to say a lot , but you have people saying things like you ca n't lose your job to injury . Was it really your job in the first place ? <p> Q. The defense seemed to be making a statement in your favor by taking an extra shot at Cedric here and there . Is that the way you saw it ? <p> A. It 's practice . You are going to get hit , but getting hit in practice is just getting thudded . In a game , they are trying to take your head off . When you get thudded , that 's the only way the defense can get better , to hit . If they do n't hit you in practice , then when they get in a game , a guy might miss tackles . They have to hit you . They have to thud you . In the game , it 's totally different . There is not going to be any control , and they are really coming after you . <p> Q. Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is my group . I 'm the oldest running back here . I am the veteran of the group , and I feel like I have to be a mentor . If I see someone do something wrong , anyone , then naturally  --  whether it 's P.J. Pope or Adrian Peterson , even if it 's Cedric  --  I 'm going to say : ' That safety is coming up on the back side there , and you should watch out for him . He might not show that he 's coming until the last minute . ' Me and running backs coach Tim Spencer are tight . He knows I understand what he understands  --  not just what I am supposed to do , but why I have to do it . I understand all that stuff . I watch it on film . I study it . I take a lot of pride in it . <p> Q. Did it bother you that people thought you were faking the hamstring injury ? <p> A. I did n't listen to any of that . The thing is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did here . Wale Ogunleye came down on the weekends and we worked out together , and he said that . When I got here for camp , I was up at 7 o'clock in the morning for a physical , and I did n't know I had to run . I thought I was going to run after the team meeting . I could have stretched out and warmed up , jumped in a hot tub . I did n't , and I tweaked my hamstring . <p> Q. Has the so-called running back competition been a distraction ? <p> A. It 's ridiculous . I feel like there is no question who the starter is , who the guy is . Everyone knows . It should n't be an issue . I am the starting running back . I look at it like this is my offense . He laughs . I mean , this is my offense . <p> mmulligan@suntimes.com Photo : Richard A.
