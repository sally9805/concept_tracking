<p> Patriot Act endangers American freedoms <p> Editor  --  Having the Justice Department waste its time doing fishing expeditions on the library , video rental or credit-card records of any private citizen without just or probable cause , while letting al Qaeda terrorist cells roam free and plan terrorist attacks here or abroad , is not my idea of keeping this nation or the world safe . <p> Please reject the current version of the Patriot Act that curtails ( instead of protects ) freedom until those objectionable provisions attacking all of our civil rights are removed from that bill . <p> LAWRENCE WONG <p> San Francisco <p> Letting lifers out <p> Editor  --  Last Sunday 's editorial ( " When justice and politics collide , " Dec. 11 ) about parole was a sad story both for Phillip Jay Seiler and the taxpayers of California . Surely , no one can seriously believe Gov . Arnold Schwarzenegger 's laughable statement that Seiler is an unreasonable public-safety risk . <p> The governor is clearly not serious about promoting rehabilitation when he overturns two-thirds of the parole board 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sentences were not meant to be given life sentences . What are the conditions under which a murderer can be considered rehabilitated , if not in this case ? <p> The facts of Seiler 's case are clear . As a California taxpayer , I can see far better uses of the money we are spending on his incarceration , and I would be happy to see him given the opportunity to begin life as a contributing member of society while he is still young enough to learn skills , work and make the transition to life on the outside . <p> KATHY GRAYSON <p> RICHARD SHANKMAN <p> Oakland <p> Chevron responds <p> Editor  --  Regarding " Oil and cancer in the Amazon " ( Insight , Dec. 11 ) : <p> Chronicle readers and Chevron Corp . were done a disservice by " Oil and cancer in the Amazon , " a distorted and inaccurate look at issues that are at the heart of a lawsuit filed against our company in the country of Ecuador . <p> The author , whose work was included in an exhibit sponsored by Amazon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court , which completely dispels the notion that Texaco Petroleum was responsible for environmental damage . <p> She failed to mention that independent epidemiologists and physicians have concluded the health studies promoted by the plaintiffs are flawed , biased and inconclusive . She ignored the dismal environmental record of Ecuador 's state oil company  --  the sole operator of the oil fields for the last 15 years . She offered no factual basis for linking plaintiffs ' health claims to our subsidiary 's operations , but merely perpetuated the same baseless inferences and innuendo made by plaintiffs . <p> We welcome an honest discussion of these important issues , and that is why we offered to meet with senior Chronicle editors to provide factual information . Instead , The Chronicle chose to publish a piece that had no sense of fairness or balance , and ignored important scientific data demonstrating Texaco 's responsible environmental record in Ecuador . <p> RUSS YARROW <p> Manager , External Relations <p> Chevron Corp . <p> San Ramon <p> Amazon Watch 's view <p> Editor  --  At Amazon Watch , we read " Oil and cancer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monitoring the lawsuit against Chevron and working closely with local indigenous groups for several years . Details of the campaign are available at chevrontoxico.com . <p> The trial is at a critical phase . Water and oil samples show that every rain-forest site tested has illegal levels of toxins , in some cases exceeding EPA standards by 2,500 times . Even 97 percent of Chevron 's own water samples have exceeded Ecuadorian norms . <p> Now , the atmosphere around the trial has taken a sinister turn . Intimidation , including a kidnap attempt against the 9-year-old daughter of one of the plaintiffs ' leaders and a death threat to one of their lawyers , has prompted the intervention of the United Nations . Meanwhile , Chevron has lobbied Congress to interfere with the judicial process . <p> These disturbing developments highlight how untenable are Chevron 's denials of wrongdoing . This historic trial should run its course without interference . Instead of spending millions on lawyers , lobbyists and PR experts , Chevron should live up to its rhetoric of corporate responsibility by financing health care for the Ecuadorians whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SOLTANI <p> Executive Director <p> Amazon Watch <p> No ' protection ' at all <p> Editor  --  Whether the San Francisco voters ' ban on handguns is thrown out by the courts or not , San Franciscans ( and all of us ) should know that in homes with a gun ( of any kind ) , the risk of a homicide ( not a legal self-defense shooting ) increases threefold , and the risk of a suicide increases almost fivefold compared to homes without a gun . These are well-established facts , confirmed by a number of studies . <p> Because so many people now recognize these risks , annual sales of handguns in California have plummeted by 71 percent , from 433,822 in 1993 to 126,233 in 2003 . <p> My son was killed unintentionally by his good friend in part because his friend 's father had been convinced by the gun industry and his buddies in the gun culture to keep a handgun loaded and unlocked next to his bed for " protection . " <p> But this kind of " protection " is no protection at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shooting is 22 times more likely to be a family member , friend or relative than an intruder . <p> That 's something to think about when you are deciding how to protect your family . <p> GRIFFIN DIX <p> Kensington <p> Lefties and the troops <p> Editor  --  I do n't understand why Cynthia Gair ( Letters , Dec. 11 ) wants the troops to come home from Iraq . It seems to me that anti-military lefties would want the troops to stay as far away from San Francisco as possible . <p> RICHARD LEWIS <p> Alamo <p> The other Tom Egan <p> Editor  --  No embarrassment in being a liberal , it is a wonderful part of democracy ( Letters , " Those liberals , " Dec. 15 ) . If the writer ( Tom Egan ) needs relief from liberalism , I suggest a move to Burma . <p> TOM EGAN <p> San Francisco <p> Making culture Editor  --  I offer this in reply to your article by Lawrence Ferlinghetti ( Insight , " If you do n't like the culture , go out and make your own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not aphids <p> despite your DDT <p> Are there still not rednecks <p> who torture for a spree <p> dark homes engulfed <p> black bullets buzzing high <p> in the jungle <p> reserved for us <p> the excess Third World people <p> who dare not eat your peach . <p> WINTERTON GARVEY <p> New York <p> Editor  --  I was dismayed while reading the article by Lawrence Ferlinghetti regarding the National Book Foundation 's new award category . <p> The author notes the following : " The absence of Third World authors from this canon , writers of color , is shocking , but no one even thought of that back then , in the last White Century . " <p> What ? " No one " ever thought of it ? I am sure that plenty of people of color thought of it , not just on how this narrow view is reflected in literature , but in most published works of that era that purport to reflect on the human condition in the United States and the rest of the world . They were thought about by many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a few . <p> Your attempt to critique those of the " White Century " carries with it the same assumption : Whites ( or more specifically , those whites making decisions that affect everyone ) are the world ; everyone else is a " no one . " Either that , or you must mean that no one in that narrow , small group that doled out elitist recognition ever thought about it back then , in the White Century . <p> Let 's put those actors in their proper perspective . Your intentions were good ; please try again . <p> ROCHELLE A. FORTIER <p> San Francisco Illustrations by Bill Russell / The Chronicle
