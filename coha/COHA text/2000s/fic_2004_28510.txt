Chapter One She was born the night the Witch Tree fell . With the first breath she drew , she tasted the power - the richness of it , and the bitterness . Her birth was one more link in a chain that had spanned centuries , a chain that was often gilded with the sheen of folklore and legend . But when the chain was rubbed clean , it held fast , tempered by the strength of truth . There were other worlds , other places , where those first cries of birth were celebrated . Far beyond the sweeping vistas of the Monterey coast , where the child 's lusty cry echoed through the old stone house , the new life was celebrated . In the secret places where magic still thrived - deep in the green hills of Ireland , on the windswept moors of Cornwall , deep in the caves of Wales , along the rocky coast of Brittany - that sweet song of life was welcomed . And the old tree , hunched and gnarled by its age and its marriage to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a mother 's willing pain , a new witch was born . Though the choice would be hers - a gift , after all , can be refused , treasured or ignored - it would remain as much a part of the child , and the woman she became , as the color of her eyes . For now she was only an infant , her sight still dim , her thoughts still half-formed , shaking angry fists in the air even as her father laughed and pressed his first kiss on her downy head . Her mother wept when the babe drank from her breast . Wept in joy and in sorrow . She knew already that she would have only this one girl child to celebrate the love and union she and her husband shared . She had looked , and she had seen . As she rocked the nursing child and sang an old song , she understood that there would be lessons to be taught , mistakes to be made . And she understood that one day - not so long from now , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for love . She hoped that of all the gifts she would pass along , all the truths she would tell , the child would understand one , the vital one . That the purest magic is in the heart . There was a marker in the ground where the Witch Tree had stood . The people of Monterey and Carmel valued nature . Tourists often came to study the words on the marker , or simply to stand and look at the sculptured old trees , the rocky shoreline , the sunning harbor seals . Locals who had seen the tree for themselves , who remembered the day it had fallen , often mentioned the fact that Morgana Donovan had been born that night . Some said it was a sign , others shrugged and called it coincidence . Still more simply wondered . No one denied that it was excellent local color to have a self-proclaimed witch born hardly a stone 's throw away from a tree with a reputation . Nash Kirkland considered it an amusing fact and an interesting hook . He spent a great deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and things that went bump in the night were a hell of a way to make a living . And he would n't have had it any other way . Not that he believed in goblins or ghoulies - or witches , if it came to that . Men did n't turn into bats or wolves at moonrise , the dead did not walk , and women did n't soar through the night on broomsticks . Except in the pages of a book , or in the flickering light and shadow of a movie screen . There , he was pleased to say , anything was possible . He was a sensible man who knew the value of illusions , and the importance of simple entertainment . He was also enough of a dreamer to conjure images out of the shades of folklore and superstition for the masses to enjoy . He 'd fascinated the horror-film buff for seven years , starting with his first - and surprisingly successful - screenplay , Shape Shifter . The fact was , Nash loved seeing his imagination come to life on-screen . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devouring popcorn while the audience caught their breath , stifled screams or covered their eyes . He delighted in knowing that the people who plunked down the price of a ticket to see one of his movies were going to get their money 's worth of chills . He always researched carefully . While writing the gruesome and amusing Midnight Blood , he 'd spent a week in Romania interviewing a man who swore he was a direct descendant of Vlad , the Impaler - Count Dracula . Unfortunately , the count 's descendant had n't grown fangs or turned into a bat , but he had proven to possess a wealth of vampire lore and legend . It was such folktales that inspired Nash to spin a story - particularly when they were related by someone whose belief gave them punch . And people considered him weird , he thought , grinning to himself as he passed the entrance to Seventeen Mile Drive . Nash knew he was an ordinary , grounded-to-earth type . At least by California standards . He just made his living from illusion , from playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took in being scared silly . He figured his value to society was his ability to take the monster out of the closet and flash it on the silver screen in Technicolor , usually adding a few dashes of unapologetic sex and sly humor .
