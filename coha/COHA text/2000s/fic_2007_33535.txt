Early Saturday Morning March 21 , 1981 Paul had always been a creature of the night . We both were . When we were children , our nocturnal habits were permissible only during Jubilees . We looked forward to staying up past midnight , and as the morning hours grew in number we watched the dim light collect itself at the edges of the sky . It was an innocent intoxication-that sleepless fatigue that comes while waiting for the tide . A strange disorientation took hold when I no longer had a night 's sleep to separate one day from another . We were n't the only ones awake . The cities were quiet on both sides , but the world along the water was a place of constant motion . Twelve hundred freighters passed through the narrow shipping channel every year on the way to the state docks up the Mobile River . The shipyards and factories , the gantries and cranes , the tall stacks that smoked up the sky day and night-these were our skyscrapers . Even in those early hours , the lights at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included . Even when I was n't close enough to see the mill , sometimes I could smell it . As a child , I thought there was no stench worse than the sulfur fumes from the paper mill . The only people who could n't smell itwere those closest to it . All the mill workers had nasal fatigue , when the fumes were so overwhelming that the nose could no longer detect them . Paul said that after a while the odor did n't bother him , but I could still smell it on his work clothes whenever he walked through the door . My brother started working in the paper mill when he turned fifteen . Mr. Davie from across the street had worked for the mill for twenty years , and he was one of the first black supervisors . We had been in Mr. Davie 's Boy Scout troop when we were young . I think some guys only joined because they knew he gave summer jobs to neighborhood boys he thought would make good workers . Most everybody wanted a plant position where they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burgers at McDonald 's or stocking shelves at TG &Y.; Paul liked his pay better than the $3.35 minimum wage my father paid me . I had asked for an even $4-would have settled for $3.50-but he said no . " You need to understand how hard some folks have to work for a dollar , " Daddy had said . He liked to lecture me on the big picture . Claimed that I 'd appreciate all I stood to gain . All this would be mine , he had said once , standing in a room full of caskets . I had never received a paycheck with a signature other than my father 's , but Paul had never had to rely on him for money . He 'd always known how to hustle for a dollar-paper routes , mowing lawns , cleaning gutters-or any of the itemized tasks listed on the " Paul Deacon Enterprises " flyers he stuffed in the neighborhood mailboxes . " Anything that you wo n't do , I can do for a dollar or two . " Before he even started working at Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our uncle Parnell had a Mercury pickup , something like the one Lamonte drove on Sanford &; Son . For ten years , it had been sitting in his backyard , where the paint had oxidized and the tires had rotted . Paul offered him $300 for it , way too much , considering . Mr. Davie had already promised Paul a job when he turned fifteen , but getting Mr. Davie 's approval was only the half of it . He still needed our parents to say okay and sign the work permit . Paul tried Mama first . " Your father and I 'll have to talk about it , " she told him . Most times that meant no , especially since Daddy thought that the paper mill was somewhere other people 's children worked , those without the benefit of a good education , middle-class upbringing , or a family business that was over a century old . He was n't the kind of man who looked down on people , but he did n't make a habit of looking up to folks either . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he had said . " Some people do it because they have no choice . Either by their own doing or by the world being what it is . There 's more to working hard than sweating for somebody 's wage . " At that time , the sign in front of the funeral home read " Six Generations in the Service . " As far as Randall Deacon was concerned , the seventh generation was a done deal . Before he had even heard about Paul 's career aspirations that summer , he had already signed us up for the certification classes at Bishop State College . He even taught the field study courses at the funeral home and hoped we 'd be among his students as we prepared to run the funeral home one day . Since I was thirteen , I had worked with my father , running errands , typing death notices , and whatnot . As soon as I got a license , I was driving the family cars I 'd spent years washing . There was never a moment when I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I was already doing it . More and more , I 'd heard my parents speak of what they planned to do in their retirement . Trips they would take , hobbies they looked forward to . The expectation seemed clear that soon after college , Paul and I would be responsible for the business . My father thought those odd jobs would be good training for the back-office side of things , but Paul was buying time . It was more than a phase . My brother had already told me that he had no intention of joining the business . " I 'll be damned if I ever drain blood from a body , " he said . My father had hopes of seeing Paul and me work in the funeral home together . Sometimes while I was there working , Daddy would slip and call me by my brother 's name . The firstborn had always worked in the business , and my father had no idea things would be any different . Eventually , it would all come to a head when Paul worked up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything at first ; he just worked that stare into Paul , waiting for him to explain .
