Danger in the Cafeteria Vicki Byrne saw me flash . A knife , she thought . Her friend Janie turned and screamed as a girl approached with the crude object . " I 'm sorry , Darla , " Janie whined . " I 'll get you the stuff today . Tomorrow at the latest . " " You wo n't be gettin ' me anything , " Darla snarled . " You 're goin ' down . " Janie scooted under the lunch table and Out the other side . Now only Vicki separated Janie from harm . " I got no problem with you , Byrne . Outta the way . " Janie hunkered down behind Vicki , She knew the damage a homemade shank could do . " I do n't have a problem with you either , Darla , " Vicki said . " Put that away . We can settle this without anybody getting hurt . " " I said I 'd make her pay if she stiffed me again . " Vicki looked for a guard . Darla had waited for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't stiff you ! " " Shut up , Janie , " Vicki said . She turned to Darla . " What if she gives your money back ? Then everything 's square , right ? " Janie tapped on Vicki 's shoulder and whispered , " I do n't have it . " " That 's it , " Darla yelled , pushing past Vicki and lunging toward Janie . Vicki grabbed Darla 's arm and pulled her down as a sharp pain invaded Vicki 's side . Someone screamed . A whistle blew . Shouting . People crowded around , looking at her . A guard pushed people away . " She 's bleeding ! " Janie yelled . Vicki felt woozy . The room spun . Something warm ran from her side . The guard shouted , " Leave the knife in ! You 'll do more damage if you take it out ! " * * * Judd passed the security gauntlet at Nicolae High . There were more Global Community guards this year . Mrs. Jenness , the principal , kept watch at the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Speeches he had heard during the most tumultuous year in history left him hollow . If he had the chance , he would use the opportunity to give a speech his classmates and their parents would never forget . Judd had never had to work for good grades . But his newfound faith had encouraged him to study the Bible like never before , and the discipline helped in other areas . Before the disappearances , several students had been ahead of him academically . Many of them had vanished . The rest he could pass with straight A 's . He set his mind toward the goal . But Judd had problems . His father 's money was quickly running out . The monthly bills , the trip to Israel , and the expense of the Underground had drained the account . If he did n't come up with an answer soon , he would be forced to sell the house . Throughout the summer , Judd and the others had written Vicki . When she wrote back , she seemed hopeful , but Judd could read between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pastor Bruce Barnes told Judd and the others to keep praying . He was working on a plan . Between his many trips overseas , Bruce had put the Young Tribulation Force through a rigorous discipleship program . Ryan called it Bible Boot Camp . Judd could n't believe how much they were growing and learning . And it was fun . Each new insight and memorized verse made him feel stronger . He had once seen the Bible as difficult to understand . Now each passage was a challenge , a truth waiting to be uncovered . When Bruce was away , Chloe Steele took them through their daily paces of study and memorization . Her friendship had meant a lot to Lionel and Ryan as well . Nothing could stop the pain of losing Vicki . They had no idea when or if she would ever return . " Thompson , in my office , " Mrs. Jenness said . " Now ! " The last time the two had been face-to-face , Judd was in a police station under suspicion for involvement with the Underground . As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your friend , Coach Handlesman , is continuing his reeducation with the Global Community . He probably wo n't be back . At least not here . " " What does that have to do with me , ma'am ? " Judd said . " If the coach really was behind the underground newspaper as he claimed , that little problem should disappear . " " And what does that have to do with me ? " Judd said without blinking . " Maybe nothing , " she said , studying him . " Just listen carefully during the assembly . The new directives from the Global Community apply doubly to you . " * * * Vicki awoke to searing pain and cried out . " Lie still and I 'll get you something , " the nurse said . Blood stained the sheets . A bandage stretched across her wound . Vicki was afraid to look at it . " You 're lucky , " the nurse said . " Did n't hit any vitals . But we had to stitch you up and give you a shot for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The nurse left as Mrs. Weems came in the room . She was a large woman whose presence was felt anywhere she went . " Care to tell me your side ? " Mrs. Weems said . " I 'm fine , thank you , " Vicki said . Mrs. Weems snarled , " You 're a strange kid , Byrne . You 're different . " " Thank you , " Vicki said . " I hate different . To survive here you have to learn to get along . " " That 's what I was doing , " Vicki said . She explained what had happened . " That was Janie 's last chance , " Mrs. Weems said . " She did n't do anything . " " She was selling drugs , " Mrs. Weems said . " She 'll be shipped downstate to an adult facility . " Vicki had heard the hard juvenile cases were being treated as adults , but she did n't want to believe it . " And me ? " " Come to my office as soon as you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed . " " Papers ? " Vicki said . " When you can walk , you 're out of here . " " I 'm going downstate too ? " Vicki said , but Mrs. Weems was already out the door . * * * The fieldhouse was full . Incoming freshmen were required to sit in the front . Most hung on Mrs. Jenness 's every word . Several times Lionel turned around and looked at Judd . Lionel rolled his eyes each time . Mrs. Jenness welcomed students and introduced key faculty members . To her right were Global Community guards in uniform . " Looks like they 're stepping up security , " John whispered . " Why do they need eight guards ? " Mark said . " It is our hope , " Mrs. Jenness said , " that when you look back at Nicolae Carpathia High School twenty years from now , you will think of a time of unprecedented peace and learning . " In six years , I wo n't be thinking about this place at all , Judd thought . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus , " Mrs. Jenness said . " He is no longer with us . We are grateful that the Global Community peacekeeping forces have been given the power to enforce the new rules . " Mark caught Judd 's eye . " Sounds like trouble , " he said . " Belief is a private matter . Individuals must come to their own conclusions . Our new policies include zero tolerance for those who push their beliefs on others . Any student , faculty member , or other employee doing this will suffer quick and severe punishment . " Judd saw several freshmen look at each other . They had to wonder what Mrs. Jenness was talking about . " Students will be expelled , their records destroyed . Hopes for higher education will be lost . Those involved in any divisive activity like last year may be sent to a Global Community reeducation facility . " John leaned over and whispered , " Are these just threats ? " " See all the extra cameras in the hallway ? " Judd said . A freshman raised a hand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time for questions . Now I want you to see another move toward school unity . " Two students , a boy and a girl , walked on stage and stood by the podium . The boy wore black pants and a gray shirt . The girl wore a black skirt and a gray top . On the left shoulder of both shirts was a dove , the new mascot of the school . " I liked it better when we were the Prospect Knights , " John said . " It 's hard to root for a football team called the Doves . " Judd stifled a laugh . " Beginning tomorrow , " Mrs. Jenness continued , " you may purchase these uniforms in the school bookstore . Those who object to our symbol of peace may opt to wear this . " She held up the same style of shirt , but in place of the dove was a huge red X. * * * Vicki winced with each step , but she had to know what Mrs. Weems was talking about . Blood oozed from her wound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have listened to me , " Mrs. Weems said . " You should n't have run away from the foster family . " " I did n't , " Vicki said . " When I became friends with their disowned daughter , I knew they would n't let me stay . " Mrs. Weems leveled her eyes at Vicki . " Everyone in here is as innocent as Anne of Green Gables . Learn , from this , Byrne . Don t get sent back here a third time . " Mrs. Weems shoved a stack of papers toward her . " Sign . " " What are these ? " " Adoption papers . " " What ? " " It 's your choice . If you 'd rather stay here " " No , " Vicki said . " I 'll sign , but " " You want to know where you 're going ? " " Exactly . " " You 'll find out tomorrow .
