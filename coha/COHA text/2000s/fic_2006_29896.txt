The Deadliest Denial By Colleen Thompson Dorchester Publishing Colleen Thompson The worst day in Claire Winslow 's life started early , with a banging at the front door that began at five A.M. Predictably , the three-legged Sheltie Spence had brought home last year barked her fool head off , so Claire 's first impulse was to chase the brown-and-white hairball to the condo 's living room and stop the noise before it woke the neighbors . Her second was to stare in horror at the door as a wave of dizziness broke over her and her body trembled like the most damaged of her patients at the rehabilitation center . Spence was due home from his shift this morning . But her husband would never bother knocking . Instead , he would try to steal in silently - a real feat , considering Pogo 's joyful histrionics whenever she spotted her master returning to the fold . On those occasions when he managed to slip past their sleeping pet , he would remove his badge and holster , then rouse his wife of four years with kisses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd done that up until his friend Dave Creighton 's death back in October . When the hammering repeated , she let go of the wriggling Sheltie and switched on the nearest lamp against the predawn gloom . Bursting into motion , Claire trotted back into her bedroom and grabbed her robe , her mind stumbling through the thought : If Spence 's dead , I 'm not letting them tell me while I stand there in one of his old tee shirts . If Spence 's dead ... God , no . She pulled the robe around her tighter and told Pogo , " If your dad 's just forgotten his keys , I 'm going to chew his ears off . " It would serve her husband right , too , for scaring her to death . Every cop knew his wife worried , even if it was the proverbial elephant in the living room they both tiptoed around , the big dread neither dared to speak of - especially in the past five months . And now it 's gone and happened anyway , she thought as her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to the door and her traitorous hand fingered the deadbolt . Pogo quieted , then crouched expectantly on her single foreleg , her body quivering with the need to either bark or wag , depending on who stood behind the still-closed door . A memory tumbled through Claire 's mind : her husband 's reminder only last week that this was San Antonio and not her goddamned **35;1479;TOOLONG and she 'd end up dead as Dave if she did n't watch herself . He 'd been furious at the moment , but it was the absolute terror shining in his blue eyes that made her hesitate now , leaning forward to peer through the peephole , her lips moving in a silent prayer : Be Spence , be Spence , be Spence . It was n't . With a cry , she fumbled through unlatching the chain and releasing the locks , then threw open the door and asked the two uniformed men , " Is he dead ? Or in the hospital ? Has someone shot my husband ? Why are you here - tell me . " Pogo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though mismatched both in terms of uniform and appearance , the men stood shoulder to shoulder , their backs as straight as steel spikes and their hats held in their hands . Claire 's gaze bored into the smaller and darker of the two , the newly-divorced sergeant she and Spence had had over for dinner just last Sunday . Claire had invited him out of sympathy , but she 'd gotten the impression he had accepted to see how Spence was behaving around her . To make sure what was happening at work had n't leached into their home life . Now , Raul Contreras shook his head before releasing a long breath through his nose . He looked hard at her , his deep-set brown gaze so sorrowful that she was reminded of the doctor who had told her , years before , that her sister Karen 's cancer had spread to the brain . Claire 's pulse thumped wildly . She was going to die , she thought . Her heart was exploding in her chest . She wished for a split second that it would hurry up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told her . " Spencer has n't been killed , and he 's not hurt either . " At first , she simply stared , unable to move or speak or draw breath . Had she heard him right , or had her mind manufactured the words that she most needed ? Hoping for some clue , she looked to the taller man , whose tan uniform stood out in contrast to the dark blue of the San Antonio PD . His hair was thick and golden brown and long for law enforcement ; his features were strong , his shoulders wide and heavily muscled , as if he 'd spent his youth alternating between football fields and weight rooms . But he had n't . Claire knew that because she knew him - a fact that shocked her . What was Joel Shepherd from her hometown doing here , at her front door ? " Spence is n't dead ? " she asked both men . She needed that confirmation more than she needed answers - or even air to breathe . " He 's not dead , " Joel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes a golder shade of green . But his expression remained as grim as the day they 'd buried Karen - the girl he should have married instead of Lori Beth Walters , one of her sister 's classmates . " I swear it . " Closing her eyes , Claire whispered , " Thank God . Thank God . Thank God . " Anything else she could handle . Anything else she could survive . But she did n't understand that there were worse things . Possibilities too dark to fathom . Possibilities she first heard in the raw emotion of Sergeant Contreras 's and Joel Shepherd 's questions . " May - may we come in ? " her husband 's supervisor asked . " Can we call someone to be with you ? " Joel added , and for the first time she noticed he wore a sheriff 's badge , not a deputy 's , as he did the last time she had heard . " How ' bout your daddy , maybe , or a friend ? " He was laying on the good old boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way that jolted forks of fear through her midsection . Shaking her head , Claire backed up , pausing only to snatch up the fifteen-pound dog and press her lower face into the thick warmth of Pogo 's fur . All the better not to scream , Claire thought as the two men entered her living room . Joel closed the door softly , but he did n't lock it . Perhaps he felt safe with his gun in its holster , or perhaps he realized , as Claire was beginning to , that the worst had come already . " Why do n't you sit down ? " Contreras asked her . Lifting her chin from the dog 's warmth , Claire felt her temper boil to the surface . " And why do n't you quit patronizing me and tell me right out - where the hell is Spencer ? Why are you two here instead of him ? " The sergeant took another deep breath . " Last night , your husband was arrested . " " He 's bein ' held in Little Bee Creek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My jail . " Claire 's knees loosened , and the miniature collie yelped in surprise as she was dropped , then tucked her tail between her legs and hop-bounced to escape into the bedroom . Before Claire understood what was happening , the two men grabbed her arms and steered her to an armchair , where they planted her . Shrugging off their hands , she cried , " That 's a lie . Why would you say such - such - Spence ca n't be in Little BC . He was on patrol last night down by the River Walk . Right here in San Antonio . " She saw the two men 's glances touch , saw how troubled both looked . When neither answered , she said , " Damn you . Damn you both - did my husband put you up to this ? If this is some sick joke , it 's not funny . " Joel sat on the sofa 's edge and angled his long legs in her direction . Those green-gold eyes skewered her , reminding her of the cougars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This is serious , Claire , and so am I. You 're going to need somebody with you . Tell me now so I can call . And then we 'll explain it to you . " She flipped her red-brown hair free of her robe 's collar . " All of it ? " When both men nodded solemnly , Claire relented . " Call my father . Please . He 's number two on my speed dial . " Number one was the entry she really wanted . Spence 's number . If she could talk to him , he 'd clear up this mistake in no time . But Joel got up to call her father , then took the telephone into her bedroom and closed the door behind him . She tried to listen , but a buzzing in her ears overwhelmed the distant murmur of his voice . " My dad 's a criminal attorney , and he lives in Little BC , " she told Sergeant Contreras . " He 'll know how to fix this . He 'll probably drive over to the jail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Spence in there . You 've told me yourself , Spence is a really good cop . He would n't be arrested . " The sergeant took the spot where Joel had been seated and looked at her from beneath the shaggy overhang of his brows . Like his hair and his thick mustache , they were salted with white strands , the only clue the man had recently celebrated his fiftieth birthday . " I know this is hard , " he said . " It 's damned hard for me , too , first losing Dave and now ... The truth is , Claire , Spencer has n't been himself lately . You know that as well as I do . " " He saw a twelve-year-old shoot down a fellow cop . " Claire heard the strain in her own voice , the bitterness that bubbled through her words - but there was nothing she could do to stop the torrent . " My husband watched his best friend die over a forty-nine-dollar video game . " Mall security , who had called police once they caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they had n't searched his clothes for weapons . When the two uniforms came in , the kid had panicked , whipping a little .38 out from under his untucked shirt , killing Dave and wounding the store detective before Spence shot the boy dead . " How can you expect him to snap right back like it was nothing ? " Claire demanded . " Aside from losing a close friend , Spence loves kids . And now he 's killed one . " There had been knee-jerk outrage in the Hispanic community , since the boy was Mexican and Dave , Spence , and the store detective all white , but the store 's video surveillance tape had cleared her husband of wrongdoing . Still , he 'd asked Claire over and over - sometimes waking her up in the middle of the night - if there was anything , anything , he could have done to save either his friend or the kid . Every time , she 'd told him no , then wrapped her arms around a body made unfamiliar by its tension . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of counseling , " Contreras told her . " And I was keeping a careful eye on him , believe me . " " Not careful enough , it sounds like . Not if he really did leave his patrol to drive over an hour to Buck County last night . I still do n't buy it . " She expected her husband 's big frame to fill the doorway any moment , expected to hear Pogo 's cheerful barking to see her master - the man who had once lifted her from a busy street , where he had found her matted and bone thin , with one front leg mangled from a run-in with a car . " He did n't work last night , Claire . He called in sick before his shift . " The shock of it went through her , and she wanted to scream , Impossible . Would have screamed , if she could speak . Because she 'd kissed Spence goodbye last night and watched him leave wearing his uniform , his badge ... his gun . His gun . " What did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small voice . " We believe he killed a man in Little BC . " She blinked in surprise at Joel Shepherd , who was standing in the bedroom doorway . Sheriff Shepherd . She had n't noticed him come back from calling her dad . But it was his words and not his presence that made her mouth go dry . " No , " she told him , shaking her head . " Of course he did n't do that . Why would Spence kill anyone up there ? I mean , that 's where we have our - " She clamped down on the thought . This could n't have anything to do with the Little BC property she and Spence had just purchased and the horse therapy center she had been planning , organizing , and raising funds for over the past two years . This had nothing to do with her dream - The dream that Spence had asked her to put on hold in the days following Dave 's shooting . She 'd told him no , she could n't . She 'd tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that if they did n't close on the acreage before Mrs. Hajek moved into the nursing home , her heir would be sure to stop the sale . Already , her realtor nephew - who had n't bothered visiting his aunt in years - had accused Claire of taking advantage of a dying woman . If Mrs. Hajek herself had n't rallied and threatened to disinherit the grasping little snot , Claire was sure the whole thing would have ended up in court . And if the woman 's long-missing daughter , Gloria , had finally turned up ... " We are n't sure what this is about , " Joel said as he crossed the room to stand beside her . " But we do know this . Adam Strickland was n't the only person - " " Adam - Adam who ? " The name struck her as familiar , but Claire could n't seem to place it . " Adam Strickland , " Joel answered , pausing only to clear his throat , " was n't the only person your husband wanted dead . There was someone else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still trying to make sense of this - or find the key that would unlock this awful nightmare and let her wake up in her bed . From the bedroom , she heard her alarm go off , an alarm meant to begin her last day at the rehabilitation center , where she had worked for the past five years as an occupational therapist . This is no dream , she told herself as Joel Shepherd knelt before her . No dream , the thought echoed as he took her ice-cold hand in his . " It was you , " Joel told her . " Your husband , Spencer Winslow , was planning to kill you . " ( Continues ... ) by Colleen Thompson
