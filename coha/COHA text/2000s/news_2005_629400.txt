<p> When The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , The Witch and the Wardrobe opens Friday , no one will be surprised if the first in line are devout Christians . C.S. Lewis ' fantastical tale of wee British children who pass through a wardrobe into a magical parallel kingdom has long been beloved by the faithful , and no wonder . It is a world drawn with vivid moral clarity . <p> In marketing the film , Disney has worked hard to court church groups without antagonizing nonbelievers - who do n't necessarily read a religious message into Narnia 's dichotomous battles between evil , embodied by a White Witch , and good , personified by a lion who dies for the sins of others and later is resurrected . Undue emphasis on Aslan 's status as an uncompromising ( if unusually large and feline ) Christ figure might turn off secular movie goers , or so the thinking goes . <p> Frankly , from the standpoint of history , such squeamishness is more than a little baffling . Whether symbolic or overt , whether epic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of movie real estate . It has never had a problem selling tickets . <p> The old studio moguls knew what they wanted from a crowd - cash - and how to get it : lure fannies into seats with proven formulae . Boy meets girl , man rides horse , cop shoots robber . The Technicolor epic ( The Greatest Story Ever Told ) , the inspirational hagiography ( Joan of Arc ) , the sugar-dolloped spiritual fable ( It 's a Wonderful Life ) , the metaphysical sports flick ( Chariots of Fire ) , the sci-fi allegory ( Star Wars , The Matrix ) and the singing-nuns revue ( Sister Act , The Sound of Music ) are all standards of cinema , and no matter how mystical they look , studies made them for the money . <p> So , no , William Wyler probably was n't interested in saving souls when he made Ben-Hur , and you wo n't find statistics listing all the hearts turned to Jesus by Nicholas Ray 's King of Kings . These films and others of a spiritual bent walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or seeming to promote ) the faith itself : They 're stories , not creeds . <p> By contrast , a number of recent books and movies ( the Left Behind series , Diary of a Mad Black Woman , The Gospel ) use story as a vehicle for creed : Fiction carries dogma into the welcoming arms of belief . <p> But filmmakers ca n't always serve both God and mammon , especially when mammon has his eye on opening-weekend box office - and they ca n't often serve both religious and secular audiences simultaneously . The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , as a fantasy with take-it-or-leave-it religious subtext , may well be one of the few films to court the secular and the sacred in equal measure . To succeed , it must respect the concerns of Christian audiences without making non-Christians feel they 've been cracked over the head with a Bible . <p> And this may be the rub . Any discomfort parsing the imagery of Narnia may have more to do with intent than content , with that tingly fear of being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fear of merely seeming to proselytize - than with the resurrected Aslan himself . <p> Such was the cause of the hand-wringing that anticipated The Passion of the Christ and the shock that greeted its success . Mel Gibson 's beliefs as a Catholic traditionalist were already controversial when the film 's Jewish portrayals drew a firestorm of criticism . The idea that he might be using his Passion as a bullhorn to trumpet an anti-Semitic reading of the gospels only amped up the outcry . <p> Yet it became a sensation ( thanks , in part , to church-group appeals not unlike Disney 's efforts with Narnia ) and was embraced by many viewers as a reverent re-enactment of Christ 's last days . <p> Compare this reception to the outrage caused by Martin Scorsese 's The Last Temptation of Christ , in which Jesus is tempted to climb down from the cross to raise a family . Like Lewis ' books and Gibson 's movie , it was created from a point of faith ; Scorsese , a nonpracticing Catholic who nevertheless claims to believe in the divinity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incarnation ( human , God , or human and God ? ) with a seriousness that few other movies have attempted , and it is in many ways a more ambitious and artful film than Gibson 's stage-bloodied literalism . But it was lambasted . <p> Which , in the storied history of religion at the movies , is n't all that surprising . The faithful do n't take offense at classic , square-jawed biblical pageants or blow-by-blow accountings of the Passion . The problem lies with films that wrestle at eye level with belief . <p> One such grappler : Kevin Smith 's Dogma , a holy-hipster parable that features God as a woman and potty-mouthed avenging angels on a rampage against idolatrous consumerism . These were n't dapper angels , like Cary Grant in " The Bishop 's Wife " , pretty , or angels full of wistful yearning , like Bruno Ganz in " Wings of Desire " or Nicolas Cage in its remake , " City of Angels " . Smith may be a man of faith , but his film was attacked as heresy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salvation , and it raised , once again , the issue of religion in film . How much faith is too much faith ? Can a film be too reverent - or not reverent enough ? Films that take the Creator lightly are n't quite anathema at the box office , as " Bruce Almighty " or the " Oh , God ! " movies clearly indicate . <p> The spirituality they present is nonspecific but inevitably Christian - if only because Judaism prohibits icons and Islam forbids all depictions of Muhammad or Allah . <p> Yet Moustapha Akkad worked his way around the Muslim injunction with 1976 's " Mohammed : Messenger of God " ( aka " The Message " ) , which was shot from the prophet 's point of view and relied on nonsacred characters talking directly to the camera . <p> Beyond such heroic efforts , many films depict the lives of religious characters : " Gandhi " ( Hinduism ) , " Kundun " ( Buddhism ) , " Ushpizin " ( Jewish Orthodoxy ) . But none aim to proselytize ; none thump a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to " The Chronicles of Narnia " . How Christian are these books ? Was Lewis evangelizing ? And how delicate is the Christian viewers ' sensibility - or the sensibility of everyone , believer or not , who read the books as kids and merely regard them as ( gulp ) stories ? <p> You need n't be a Christian to read " The Chronicles of Narnia " any more than you need to own a wand to enjoy the Harry Potter catalog . But there is a difference : Lewis wrote his works from a point of faith as an exercise in faith , whereas J.K. Rowling is not , by any known account , a practicing witch . <p> Of course , Lewis ' books are easily enjoyed for their plucky juvenile characters and lively swashbuckling , just as his science-fiction trilogy can be enjoyed outside of their cosmic battles with Satan . When Lewis first imagined the " Narnia " books , he pictured images : a faun , a queen , a lion . But once he started writing , the Christian element " pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lewis wrote , " is an invention giving an imaginary answer to the question What might Christ become like , if there really were a world like " Narnia " and He chose to be incarnate and die and rise again in that world as He actually has done in ours ?

" It 's something simpler and more powerful , something you can always find at the movies : a fairy tale . <p> ... <p> For a listing of holiday films , see Page F25 <p> CORRECTION-DATE : December 8 , 2005 <p> CORRECTION : <p> CORRECTION : A photo caption that accompanies this story misidentifies the film " Constantine , " starring Keanu Reeves . 1 .
