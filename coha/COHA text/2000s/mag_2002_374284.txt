In Clinton , Miss. , the headquarters of WorldCom rises out of the moonscape of Waffle Houses and Pizza Huts like a dark steel mother ship . It is rather shocking to turn the corner and see it there , lurking behind the freeway as if it had been teleported into this tiny town . In 1999 WorldCom founder Bernie Ebbers moved the company here , to his old college town , and everything changed . Employees started wearing their badges around town as a sign of their achievement . A Wal-Mart Supercenter sprang up . And millions of Ebbers ' dollars went to making over Mississippi College . When friends came to visit Cynthia Cooper for lunch , she would give them a tour of the facility . This is the town where she had grown up , and she was proud of this company that knew no bounds . Cooper too had ridden the wave , becoming vice president of internal audit of what was , for a time , the 25th biggest company in the country . <P> Last June , Cooper told the audit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing dirty with its accounting practices . She knew as she said it what would happen . Within days , the company fired its famed chief financial officer , Scott Sullivan , and told the world that it had inflated its profits by $3.8 billion  --  the largest accounting fraud in history . The number has since grown to $9 billion , and counting . Her colleagues have been placed in handcuffs and led past TV cameras . Shareholders have lost some $3 billion since the news broke , and soon at least 17,000 WorldCom employees will have lost their jobs . In December , the company put a FOR SALE sign on the hangar that stored its corporate jets in Mississippi . <P> Cooper , meanwhile , still drives to the desolate Clinton headquarters every day . She had spent her career trying to get the higher-ups to take her internal-auditing division seriously ; it is only now , in bankruptcy , that WorldCom is finally doing so . Cooper , 38 , a petite blond , has been given more money and twice as many staff members . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And it is quite obvious that she is heartbroken . " There have been times , " says Cooper , a woman not given to intense displays of emotion , " that I could not stop crying . " <P> Cooper went home to Clinton in 1991 , leaving a career and a failed marriage in Atlanta . She had a 2-year-old daughter and needed a job fast . So she just picked up the phone and started calling CFOs . She got a job at WorldCom  --  then named LDDS  --  as a contract employee making $12 an hour . After a brief stint at SkyTel , a paging company that would later be acquired by WorldCom , she returned to LDDS in 1994 to start the internal-audit department . The company was precocious and growing fast , and founder Ebbers and his team had little interest in the kind of financial nitpicking her division represented . But Cooper prepared to win them over . " These guys were entrepreneurs . There was a need to prove ourselves and the value of internal auditing , " she remembers . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be . We were moving and shaking and acquiring companies . "
