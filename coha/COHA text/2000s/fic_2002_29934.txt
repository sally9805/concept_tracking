There were three watchers , two men and a boy . They were using telescopes , not field glasses . It was a question of distance . They were almost a mile from their target area , because of the terrain . There was no closer cover . It was low , undulating country , burned khaki by the sun , grass and rock and sandy soil alike . The nearest safe concealment was the broad dip they were in , a bone-dry gulch scraped out a million years ago by a different climate , when there had been rain and ferns and rushing rivers . The men lay prone in the dust with the early heat on their backs , their telescopes at their eyes . The boy scuttled around on his knees , fetching water from the cooler , watching for waking rattlesnakes , logging comments in a notebook . They had arrived before first light in a dusty pick-up truck , the long way around , across the empty land from the west . They had thrown a dirty tarpaulin over the truck and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rim of the dip and settled in , raising their telescopes as the low morning sun dawned to the east behind the red house almost a mile away . This was Friday , their fifth consecutive morning , and they were low on conversation . " Time ? " one of the men asked . His voice was nasal , the effect of keeping one eye open and the other eye shut . The boy checked his watch . " Six-fifty , " he answered . " Any moment now , " the man with the telescope said . The boy opened his book and prepared to make the same notes he had madefour times before . " Kitchen light on , " the man said . The boy wrote it down . 6:50 , kitchen light on . The kitchen faced them , looking west away from the morning sun , so it stayed dark even after dawn . " On her own ? " the boy asked . " Same as always , " the second man said , squinting . Maid prepares breakfast , the boy wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inch by inch . It jacked itself higher into the sky and pulled the shadows shorter and shorter . The red house had a tall chimney coming out of the kitchen wing like the finger on a sundial . The shadow it made swung and shortened and the heat on the watchers ' shoulders built higher . Seven o'clock in the morning , and it was already hot . By eight , it would be burning . By nine , it would be fearsome . And they were there all day , until dark , when they could slip away unseen . " Bedroom drapes opening , " the second man said . " She 's up and about . " The boy wrote it down . 7:04 , bedroom drapes open . " Now listen , " the first man said . They heard the well pump kick in , faintly from almost a mile away . A quiet mechanical click , and then a steady low drone . " She 's showering , " the man said . The boy wrote it down . 7:06 , target starts to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to happen while she was in the shower . How could it ? They lowered their telescopes and blinked against the brassy sun in their eyes . The well pump clicked off after six minutes . The silence sounded louder than the faint noise had . The boy wrote : 7:12 , target out of shower . The men raised their telescopes again . " She 's dressing , I guess , " the first man said . The boy giggled . " Can you see her naked ? " The second man was triangulated twenty feet to the south . He had the better view of the back of the house , where her bedroom window was . " You 're disgusting , " he said . " You know that ? " The boy wrote : 7:15 , probably dressing . Then : 7:20 , probably downstairs , probably eating breakfast . " She 'll go back up , brush her teeth , " he said . The man on the left shifted on his elbows . " For sure , " he said . " Prissy little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drapes again , " the man on the right said . It was standard practice in the west of Texas , in the summer , especially if your bedroom faced south , like this one did . Unless you wanted to sleep the next night in a room hotter than a pizza oven . " Stand by , " the man said . " A buck gets ten she goes out to the barn now . " It was a wager that nobody took , because so far four times out of four she had done exactly that , and watchers are paid to notice patterns . " Kitchen door 's open . " The boy wrote : 7:27 , kitchen door opens . " Here she comes . " She came out , dressed in a blue gingham dress that reached to her knees and left her shoulders bare . Her hair was tied back behind her head . It was still damp from the shower . " What do you call that sort of a dress ? " the boy asked . " Halter , " the man on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halter dress , goes to barn , the boy wrote . She walked across the yard , short hesitant steps against the uneven ruts in the baked earth , maybe seventy yards . She heaved the barn door open and disappeared in the gloom inside . The boy wrote : 7:29 , target in barn . " How hot is it ? " the man on the left asked . " Maybe a hundred degrees , " the boy said . " There 'll be a storm soon . Heat like this , there has to be . " " Here comes her ride , " the man on the right said . Miles to the south , there was a dust cloud on the road . A vehicle , making slow and steady progress north . " She 's coming back , " the man on the right said . 7:32 , target comes out of barn , the boy wrote . " Maid 's at the door , " the man said . The target stopped at the kitchen door and took her lunch box from the maid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side . She paused for a second . Her skin was pink and damp from the heat . She leaned down to adjust her socks and then trotted out to the gate , through the gate , to the shoulder of the road . The school bus slowed and stopped and the door opened with a sound the watchers heard clearly over the faint rattle of the idling engine . The chrome handrails flashed once in the sun . The diesel exhaust hung and drifted in the hot still air . The target heaved her lunch box onto the step and grasped the bright rails and clambered up after it . The door closed again and the watchers saw her corn-colored head bobbing along level with the base of the windows . Then the engine noise deepened and the gears caught and the bus moved away with a new cone of dust kicking up behind it . 7:36 , target on bus to school , the boy wrote . The road north was dead straight and he turned his head and watched the bus all the way until the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mirage . Then he closed his notebook and secured it with a rubber band . Back at the red house , the maid stepped inside and closed the kitchen door . Nearly a mile away , the watchers lowered their telescopes and turned their collars up for protection from the sun . Seven thirty-seven , Friday morning . Seven thirty-eight . Seven thirty-nine , more than three hundred miles to the north and east , Jack Reacher climbed out of his motel room window . One minute earlier , he had been in the bathroom , brushing his teeth . One minute before that , he had opened the door of his room to check the morning temperature . He had left it open , and the closet just inside the entrance passageway was faced with mirrored glass , and there was a shaving mirror in the bathroom on a cantilevered arm , and by a freak of optical chance he caught sight of four men getting out of a car and walking toward the motel office . Pure luck , but a guy as vigilant as Jack Reacher gets lucky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police cruiser . It had a shield on the door , and because of the bright sunlight and the double reflection he could read it clearly . At the top it said City Police , and then there was a fancy medallion in the middle with Lubbock , Texas written underneath . All four men who got out were in uniform . They had bulky belts with guns and radios and nightsticks and handcuffs . Three of the men he had never seen before , but the fourth guy was familiar . The fourth guy was a tall heavyweight with a gelled blond brush-cut above a meaty red face . This morning the meaty red face was partially obscured by a glinting aluminum splint carefully taped over a shattered nose . His right hand was similarly bound up with a splint and bandages protecting a broken forefinger . The guy had neither injury the night before . And Reacher had no idea the guy was a cop . He just looked like some idiot in a bar . Reacher had gone there because he heard the music was good , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band and ended up on a bar stool watching ESPN on a muted television fixed high on a wall . The place was crowded and noisy , and he was wedged in a space with a woman on his right and the heavyweight guy with the brush-cut on his left . He got bored with the sports and turned around to watch the room . As he turned , he saw how the guy was eating . The guy was wearing a white tank-top shirt and he was eating chicken wings . The wings were greasy and the guy was a slob . He was dripping chicken fat off his chin and off his fingers onto his shirt . There was a dark teardrop shape right between his pecs . It was growing and spreading into an impressive stain . But the best barroom etiquette does n't let you linger on such a sight , and the guy caught Reacher staring . " Who you looking at ? " he said . It was said low and aggressively , but Reacher ignored it . " Who you looking at ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they say it once , maybe nothing 's going to happen . But they say it twice , then trouble 's on the way . Fundamental problem is , they take a lack of response as evidence that you 're worried . That they 're winning . But then , they wo n't let you answer , anyway . " You looking at me ? " the guy said . " No , " Reacher answered . " Do n't you be looking at me , boy , " the guy said . The way he said boy made Reacher think he was maybe a foreman in a lumber mill or a cotton operation . Whatever muscle work was done around Lubbock . Some kind of a traditional trade passed down through the generations . Certainly the word cop never came to his mind . But then , he was relatively new to Texas . " Do n't you look at me , " the guy said . Reacher turned his head and looked at him . Not really to antagonize the guy . Just to size him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day he would come face to face with his physical equal . With somebody who might worry him . But he looked and saw this was n't the day . So he just smiled and looked away again . Then the guy jabbed him with his finger . " I told you not to look at me , " he said , and jabbed . It was a meaty forefinger and it was covered in grease . It left a definite mark on Reacher 's shirt . " Do n't do that , " Reacher said . The guy jabbed again . " Or what ? " he said . " You want to make something out of it ? " Reacher looked down . Now there were two marks . The guy jabbed again . Three jabs , three marks . Reacher clamped his teeth . What were three greasy marks on a shirt ? He started a slow count to ten . Then the guy jabbed again , before he even reached eight . " You deaf ? " Reacher said . " I told you not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about it ? " " No , " Reacher said . " I really do n't . I just want you to stop doing it , is all . " The guy smiled . " Then you 're a yellow-bellied piece of shit . " " Whatever , " Reacher said . " Just keep your hands off me . " " Or what ? What you going to do ? " Reacher restarted his count . Eight , nine . " You want to take this outside ? " the guy asked . Ten . " Touch me again and you 'll find out , " Reacher said . " I warned you four times . " The guy paused a second . Then , of course , he went for it again . Reacher caught the finger on the way in and snapped it at the first knuckle . Just folded it upward like he was turning a door handle . Then because he was irritated he leaned forward and headbutted the guy full in the face . It was a smooth move , well delivered , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been . No need to put a guy in a coma , over four grease marks on a shirt . He moved a pace to give the man room to fall , and backed into the woman on his right . " Excuse me , ma'am , " he said . The woman nodded vaguely , disoriented by the noise , concentrating on her drink , unaware of what was happening . The big guy thumped silently on the floorboards and Reacher used the sole of his shoe to roll him half onto his front . Then he nudged him under the chin with his toe to pull his head back and straighten his airway . The recovery position , paramedics call it . Stops you choking while you 're out . Then he paid for his drinks and walked back to his motel , and did n't give the guy another thought until he was at the bathroom mirror and saw him out and about in a cop 's uniform . Then he thought hard , and as fast as he could . He spent the first second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does that mean he can see me ? The answer was yes , of course he can . If he was looking the right way , which he was n't yet . He spent the next second mad at himself . He should have picked up the signs . They had been there . Who else would be poking at a guy built like him , except somebody with some kind of protected status ? Some kind of imagined invulnerability ? He should have picked up on it . So what to do ? The guy was a cop on his own turf . And Reacher was an easily recognizable target . Apart from anything else he still had the four grease spots on his shirt , and a brand-new bruise on his forehead . There were probably forensics people who could match its shape to the bones in the guy 's nose . So what to do ? An angry cop bent on revenge could cause trouble . A lot of trouble . A noisy public arrest , for sure , maybe some wild gunshots , definitely some four-on-one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the station house , where you ca n't fight back without multiplying your original legal problem . Then all kinds of difficult questions , because Reacher habitually carried no ID and nothing else at all except his toothbrush and a couple of thousand dollars cash in his pants pocket . So he would be regarded as a suspicious character . Almost certainly he 'd be charged with attacking a law officer . That was probably a big deal in Texas . All kinds of witnesses would materialize to swear it was malicious and completely unprovoked . He could end up convicted and in the penitentiary , easy as anything . He could end up with seven-to-ten in some tough establishment . Which was definitely not number one on his wish list . So discretion was going to be the better part of valor . He put his toothbrush in his pocket and walked through the room and opened the window . Unclipped the screen and dropped it to the ground . Climbed out and closed the window and rested the screen back in its frame and walked away across a vacant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on walking until he was hidden by a low building . He looked for buses . There were n't any . He looked for taxis . Nothing doing . So he stuck out his thumb . He figured he had ten minutes to find a ride before they finished at the motel and started cruising the streets . Ten minutes , maybe fifteen at the outside . Which meant it was n't going to work . It could n't work . Seven thirty-nine in the morning , the temperature was already over a hundred degrees . It was going to be impossible to get a ride at all . In heat like that no driver on the planet would open their door long enough for him to slide right in , never mind for any long prior discussions about destinations . So finding a getaway in time was going to be impossible . Absolutely impossible . He started planning alternatives , because he was so sure of it . But it turned out he was wrong . It turned out his whole day was a series of surprises . * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman . They were an out-of-state professional crew , based in Los Angeles , contactable through an intermediary in Dallas and a second cut-out in Vegas . They had been in business ten years , and they were very good at what they did , which was take care of problems anywhere in the Southwest and survive to get paid and do it over again as many times as anybody asked them to . Ten years , and never once a hint of a problem . A good team . Meticulous , inventive , perfectionist . As good as it gets , in their strange little world . And perfectly suited to it . They were bland , forgettable , white , anonymous . To see them together , they looked like the branch office of a photocopier company on its way to a sales convention . Not that they were ever seen together , except by their victims . They traveled separately . One always drove , and the other two flew , always by different routes . The driver was one of the men , because invisibility was their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still slightly more memorable than a man . The car was always rented , always at LAX arrivals , which had the busiest rental counters in the world . It was always a generic family sedan , a mud-colored nothing car . The license and the credit card used to obtain it were always real , properly issued in a distant state to a person who had never existed . The driver would wait on the sidewalk and then line up when a busy flight was spilling out into baggage claim when he would be just one face among a hundred . He was small and dark and had a rolling duffel and a carry-on and a harassed expression , same as everybody else . He did the paperwork at the counter and rode the bus to the rental compound and found his allotted car . He dumped his bags in the trunk , waited at the exit check , and drove out into the glare . He spent forty minutes on the freeways , driving a wide aimless circle around the whole of the metropolitan area , making sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Hollywood and stopped at a lock-up garage in an alley behind a lingerie salon . He left the motor running and opened the garage door and opened the trunk and swapped his rolling duffel and his carry-on for two big valises made of thick black nylon . One of them was very heavy . The heavy valise was the reason he was driving , not flying . It contained things best kept away from airport scanners . He closed up the garage and rolled east on Santa Monica Boulevard and turned south on 101 and hooked east again on 10 . Squirmed in his seat and settled in for the two-day drive all the way out to Texas . He was n't a smoker , but he lit numerous cigarettes and held them between his fingers and flicked ash on the carpets , on the dash , on the wheel . He let the cigarettes burn out and crushed the butts in the ashtray . That way , the rental company would have to vacuum the car very thoroughly , and spray it with air freshener , and wipe down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trace of him later , including his fingerprints . The second man was on the move , too . He was taller and heavier and fairer , but there was nothing memorable about him . He joined the end-of-the-work-day crush at LAX and bought a ticket to Atlanta . When he got there , he swapped his wallet for one of the five spares in his carry-on and a completely different man bought another ticket for Dallas-Fort Worth . The woman traveled a day later . That was her privilege , because she was the team leader . She was closing in on middle age , medium-sized , medium-blond . Nothing at all special about her , except she killed people for a living . She left her car in the LAX long-term parking , which was n't dangerous because her car was registered to a Pasadena infant who had died of the measles thirty years previously . She rode the shuttle bus to the terminal and used a forged MasterCard to buy her ticket , and a genuine New York driver 's license for photo ID at the gate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting his second day on the road . After his second stop for gas on the first day , he had made a detour into the New Mexico hills and found a quiet dusty shoulder where he squatted in the cool thin air and changed the car 's California plates for Arizona plates , which he took from the heavier valise . He wound his way back to the highway and drove another hour , then pulled off the road and found a motel . He paid cash , used a Tucson address , and let the desk clerk copy the Arizona plate number onto the registration form . He slept six hours with the room air on low and was back on the road early . Made it to Dallas-Fort Worth at the end of the second day and parked in the airport long-term lot . Took his valises with him and used the shuttle bus to departures . Took the moving stairs straight down to arrivals and lined up at the Hertz counter . Hertz , because they rent Fords , and he needed a Crown Victoria . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bus to the Hertz lot and found his car . It was the plain-jane Crown Vic , in steel blue metallic , neither light nor dark . He was happy with it . He heaved his bags into the trunk and drove to a motel near the new ballpark on the road from Fort Worth to Dallas . Checked in with the same Illinois ID , ate , and slept a few hours . He woke early and met his two partners in the fierce morning heat outside the motel at exactly the same moment Jack Reacher first stuck out his thumb , more than four hundred miles away in Lubbock. * * * Second surprise after the cop showing up was he got a ride within three minutes . He was n't even sweating yet . His shirt was still dry . Third surprise was the driver who stopped for him was a woman . Fourth and biggest surprise of all was the direction their subsequent conversation took . He had been hitching rides for the best part of twenty-five years , in more countries than he could easily recall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticking out his thumb and climbing into a car he could remember . As a mode of transportation , hitching rides was dying out . That was his conclusion , based on a lot of experience . Commercial drivers had insurance problems with it , and private citizens were getting worried about it . Because who knew what kind of a psycho you were ? And in Reacher 's case , it was worse than the average , especially right then . He was n't some dapper little guy , neat and inoffensive . He was a giant , six-five , heavily built , close to two hundred and fifty pounds . Up close , he was usually scruffy , usually unshaven , and his hair was usually a mess . People worried about him . They stayed away from him . And now he had the fresh new bruise on his forehead . Which was why he was surprised about the three minutes . And why he was surprised about the woman driver . There 's usually a pecking order , based on some kind of subconscious assessment of risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a ride from an older man easiest of all , because where 's the threat in that ? Although now , with some of the young girls turning into scam artists wanting a hundred bucks in exchange for dropping fake molestation claims , even that is getting harder . And whatever , right down there at the bottom of the list is a big scruffy guy getting a ride from a neat slender woman in an expensive coupe . But it happened . Within three minutes . He was hurrying south and west of the motel strip , stunned by the heat , hard to see in the jagged morning shadows , his left thumb jammed out urgently , when she pulled over at his side with the wet hiss of wide tires on hot pavement . It was a big white car and the sun on the hood dazzled him . He turned blindly and she buzzed her far window down . Seven forty-two , Friday morning . " Where to ? " she called , like she was a cab driver , not a private citizen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly . It was a dumb thing to say , because to have no specific destination usually makes things worse . They think you 're some kind of an aimless drifter , which makes them suspicious , and makes them worried they might never get rid of you . Makes them worried you 'll want to ride all the way home with them . But this woman just nodded . " O.K. , " she said . " I 'm headed down past Pecos . " He paused a beat , surprised . Her head was ducked down , her face tilted up , looking out at him through the window . " Great , " he said . He stepped off the curb and opened the door and slid inside . The interior was freezing cold . She had the air roaring on maximum and the seat was leather and it felt like a block of ice . She buzzed the window up again with the button on her side as he swung the door shut behind him . " Thanks , " he said . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . Just made some kind of all-purpose dismissive gesture away from him as she craned to look over her shoulder at the traffic stream behind her . People have their reasons for giving rides , all of them different . Maybe they hitched a lot when they were younger and now they 're settled and comfortable they want to put back what they took out . Like a circular thing . Maybe they have charitable natures . Or maybe they 're just lonely and want a little conversation . But if this woman wanted conversation she was in no kind of a hurry to get it started . She just waited for a couple of trucks to labor past and pulled out behind them without a word . Reacher glanced around inside the car . It was a Cadillac , two doors , but as long as a boat , and very fancy . Maybe a couple of years old , but as clean as a whistle . The leather was the color of old bones and the glass was tinted like an empty bottle of French wine . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back seat . The pocketbook was anonymous and black , maybe plastic . The briefcase was made from weathered cowhide , the sort of thing that already looks old when you buy it . It was zipped open and there was a lot of folded paper stuffed in it , the sort of thing you see in a lawyer 's office . " Move the seat back , if you want , " the woman said . " Give yourself room . " " Thanks , " he said again . He found switches on the door shaped like seat cushions . He fiddled with them and quiet motors eased him rearward and reclined his backrest . Then he lowered the seat , to make himself inconspicuous from outside . The motors whirred . It was like being in a dentist 's chair . " That looks better , " she said . " More comfortable for you . " Her own chair was tight up to the wheel , because she was small . He twisted in his seat so he could look her over without staring straight at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Altogether a small person . Maybe a hundred pounds , maybe thirty years old . Long black wavy hair , dark eyes , small white teeth visible behind a tense half-smile . Mexican , he guessed , but not the type of Mexican who swims the Rio Grande looking for a better life . This woman 's ancestors had enjoyed a better life for hundreds of years . That was pretty clear . It was in her genes . She looked like some kind of Aztec royalty . She was wearing a simple cotton dress , printed with a pale pattern . Not much to it , but it looked expensive . It was sleeveless and finished above her knees . Her arms and legs were dark and smooth , like they had been polished . " So , where are you headed ? " she asked . Then she paused and smiled wider . " No , I already asked you that . You did n't seem very clear about where you want to go . " Her accent was pure American , maybe more western than southern . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her fingers . There was a slim wedding band , and a platinum thing with a big diamond . " Anywhere , " Reacher said . " Anywhere I end up , that 's where I want to go . " She paused and smiled again . " Are you running away from something ? Have I picked up a dangerous fugitive ? " Her smile meant it was n't a serious question , but he found himself thinking maybe it ought to have been . It was n't too far-fetched , in the circumstances . She was taking a risk . The sort of risk that was killing the art of hitching rides , as a mode of transportation . " I 'm exploring , " he said . " Exploring Texas ? They already discovered it . " " Like a tourist , " he said . " But you do n't look like a tourist . The tourists we get wear polyester leisure suits and come in a bus . " She smiled again as she said it . She looked good when she smiled . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of elegance . An elegant Mexican woman , wearing an expensive dress , clearly comfortable with talking . Driving a Cadillac . He was suddenly aware of his short answers , and his hair and his stubble and his stained shirt and his creased khaki pants . And the big bruise on his forehead . " You live around here ? " he asked , because she 'd said the tourists we get , and he felt he needed something to say . " I live south of Pecos , " she said . " More than three hundred miles from here . I told you , that 's where I 'm headed . " " Never been there , " he said . She went quiet and waited at a light . Took off again through a wide junction and hugged the right lane . He watched her thigh move as she pressed on the gas pedal . Her bottom lip was caught between her teeth . Her eyes were narrowed . She was tense about something , but she had it under control . " So , did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Buddy Holly statue . " He saw her glance down at the radio , like she was thinking this guy likes music , maybe I should put some on . " You like Buddy Holly ? " she asked . " Not really , " Reacher said . " Too tame for me . " She nodded at the wheel . " I agree . I think Ritchie Valens was better . He was from Lubbock , too . " He nodded back . " I saw him in the Walk of Fame . " " How long were you in Lubbock ? " " A day . " " And now you 're moving on . " " That 's the plan . " " To wherever , " she said . " That 's the plan , " he said again . They passed the city limit . There was a small metal sign on a pole on the sidewalk . He smiled to himself . CITY POLICE , the shield on the cop car had said . He turned his head and watched danger disappear behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crown Victoria , with the tall fair man driving to give the small dark man a break . The woman sat in the back . They rolled out of the motel lot and picked up speed on I-20 , heading west , toward Fort Worth , away from Dallas . Nobody spoke . Thinking about the vast interior of Texas was oppressing them . The woman had read a guidebook in preparation for the mission that pointed out that the state makes up fully seven percent of America 's land mass and is bigger than most European countries . That did n't impress her . Everybody knew all that standard-issue Texas-is-real-big bullshit . Everybody always has . But the guide book also pointed out that side-to-side Texas is wider than the distance between New York and Chicago . That information had some impact . And it underlined why they were facing such a long drive , just to get from one nowhere interior location to another . But the car was quiet and cool and comfortable , and it was as good a place to relax as any motel room would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after all . * * * The woman slowed and made a shallow right , toward New Mexico , then a mile later a left , straight south , toward old Mexico . Her dress was creased across the middle , like maybe she was wearing it a second day . Her perfume was subtle , mixed into the freezing air from the dashboard vents . " So is Pecan worth seeing ? " Reacher asked , in the silence . " Pecos , " she said . " Right , Pecos . " She shrugged . " I like it , " she said . " It 's mostly Mexican , so I 'm comfortable there . " Her right hand tensed on the wheel . He saw tendons shifting under the skin . " You like Mexican people ? " she asked . He shrugged back . " As much as I like any people , I guess . " " You do n't like people ? " " It varies . " " You like cantaloupe ? " " As much as I like any fruit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Texas , " she said . " And therefore , in their opinion , in the whole of the world . Also there 's a rodeo there in July , but you 've missed it for this year . And just north of Pecos is Loving County . You ever heard of Loving County ? " He shook his head . " Never been here before . " " It 's the least-populated county in the whole of the United States , " she said . " Well , if you leave out some of the places in Alaska , I guess . But also the richest , per capita . Population is a hundred and ten souls , but there are four hundred and twenty oil leases active . " He nodded . " So let me out in Pecos . It sounds like a fun place . " " It was the real Wild West , " she said . " A long time ago , of course . The Texas and Pacific Railroad put a stop there . So there were saloons and all . Used to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as a town . A verb , and also a place . To pecos somebody meant to shoot them and throw them in the Pecos River . " " They still do that ? " She smiled again . A different smile . This smile traded some elegance for some mischief . It eased her tension . It made her appealing . " No , they do n't do that so much , now , " she said . " Your family from Pecos ? " " No , California , " she said . " I came to Texas when I got married . " Keep talking , he thought . She saved your ass . " Been married long ? " he asked . " Just under seven years . " " Your family been in California long ? " She paused and smiled again . " Longer than any Californian , that 's for sure , " she said . They were in flat empty country and she eased the silent car faster down a dead-straight road . The hot sky was tinted bottle-green by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a hundred and ten degrees outside and sixty inside . " You a lawyer ? " he asked . She was puzzled for a moment , and then she made the connection and craned to glance at her briefcase in the mirror . " No , " she said . " I 'm a lawyer 's client . " The conversation went dead again . She seemed nervous , and he felt awkward about it . " And what else are you ? " he asked . She paused a beat . " Somebody 's wife and mother , " she said . " And somebody 's daughter and sister , I guess . And I keep a few horses . That 's all . What are you ? " " Nothing in particular , " Reacher said . " You have to be something , " she said . " Well , I used to be things , " he said . " I was somebody 's son , and somebody 's brother , and somebody 's boyfriend . " " Was ? " " My parents died , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not a great line , he thought . She said nothing back . " And I do n't have any horses , " he added . " I 'm very sorry , " she said . " That I do n't have horses ? " " No , that you 're all alone in the world . " " Water under the bridge , " he said . " It 's not as bad as it sounds . " " You 're not lonely ? " He shrugged . " I like being alone . " She paused . " Why did your girlfriend leave you ? " " She went to work in Europe . " " And you could n't go with her ? " " She did n't really want me to go with her . " " I see , " she said . " Did you want to go with her ? " He was quiet for a beat . " Not really , I guess , " he said . " Too much like settling down . " " And you do n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two nights in the same motel gives me the creeps . " " Hence one day in Lubbock , " she said . " And the next day in Pecos , " he said . " And after that ? " He smiled . " After that , I have no idea , " he said . " And that 's the way I like it . " She drove on , silent as the car . " So you are running away from something , " she said . " Maybe you had a very settled life before and you want to escape from that particular feeling . " He shook his head again . " No , the exact opposite , really . I was in the army all my life , which is very unsettled , and I grew to like the feeling . " " I see , " she said . " You became habituated to chaos , maybe . " " I guess so . " She paused . " How is a person in the army all his life ? " " My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ military bases all over the world , and then I stayed in afterward . " " But now you 're out . " He nodded . " All trained up and nowhere to go . " He saw her thinking about his answer . He saw her tension come back . She started stepping harder on the gas , maybe without realizing it , maybe like an involuntary reflex . He had the feeling her interest in him was quickening , like the car . Ford builds Crown Victorias at its plant up in St. Thomas , Canada , tens of thousands a year , and almost all of them without exception are sold to police departments , taxicab companies , or rental fleets . Almost none of them are sold to private citizens . Full-size turnpike cruisers no longer earn much of a market share , and for those die-hards who still want one from the Ford Motor Company , the Mercury Grand Marquis is the same car in fancier clothes for about the same money , so it mops up the private sales . Which makes private Crown Vics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see one that is n't taxicab yellow or black and white with Police all over the doors is to think it 's an unmarked detective 's car . Or government issue of some other kind , maybe U.S. Marshals , or FBI , or Secret Service , or a courtesy vehicle given to a medical examiner or a big-city fire chief . That 's the subliminal impression , and there are ways to enhance it a little . In the empty country halfway to Abilene , the tall fair man pulled off the highway and headed through vast fields and past dense woodlands until he found a dusty turn-out probably ten miles from the nearest human being . He stopped there and turned off the motor and popped the trunk . The small dark man heaved the heavy valise out and laid it on the ground . The woman zipped it open and handed a pair of Virginia plates to the tall fair man . He took a screwdriver from the valise and removed the Texas plates , front and rear . Bolted the Virginia issue in their place . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four wheels , leaving the cheap black steel rims showing . He stacked the wheel covers like plates and pitched them into the trunk . The woman took radio antennas from the valise , four of them , CB whips and cellular telephone items bought cheap at a Radio Shack in L.A. The cellular antennas stuck to the rear window with self-adhesive pads . She waited until the trunk was closed again and placed the CB antennas on the lid . They had magnetic bases . They were n't wired up to anything . They were just for show . Then the small dark man took his rightful place behind the wheel and U-turned through the dust and headed back to the highway , cruising easily . A Crown Vic , plain steel wheels , a forest of antennas , Virginia plates . Maybe an FBI pool car , three agents inside , maybe on urgent business . " What did you do in the army ? " the woman asked , very casually . " I was a cop , " Reacher said . " They have cops in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Military police . Like cops , inside the service . " " I did n't know that , " she said . She went quiet again . She was thinking hard . She seemed excited . " Would you mind if I asked you some questions ? " she said . He shrugged . " You 're giving me a ride . " She nodded . " I would n't want to offend you . " " That would be hard to do , in the circumstances . Hundred and ten degrees out there , sixty in here . " " There 'll be a storm soon . There has to be , with a temperature like this . " He glanced ahead at the sky . It was tinted bottle-green by the windshield glass , and it was blindingly clear . " I do n't see any sign of it , " he said . She smiled again , briefly . " May I ask where you live ? " " I do n't live anywhere , " he said . " I move around . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He shook his head . " What you see is what I 've got . " " You travel light , " she said . " Light as I can . " She paused for a fast mile . " Are you out of work ? " she asked . He nodded . " Usually . " " Were you a good cop ? In the army ? " " Good enough , I guess . They made me a major , gave me some medals . " She paused . " So why did you leave ? " It felt like an interview . For a loan , or for a job . " They downsized me out of there , " he said . " End of the Cold War , they wanted a smaller army , not so many people in it , so they did n't need so many cops to look after them . " She nodded . " Like a town . If the population gets smaller , the police department gets smaller , too . Something to do with appropriations . Taxes , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a very small town , " she said . " Echo , south of Pecos , like I told you . It 's a lonely place . That 's why they named it Echo . Not because it 's echoey , like an empty room . It 's from ancient Greek mythology . Echo was a young girl in love with Narcissus . But he loved himself , not her , so she pined away until just her voice was left . So that 's why it 's called Echo . Not many inhabitants . But it 's a county , too . A county and a township . Not as empty as Loving County , but there 's no police department at all . Just the county sheriff , on his own . " Something in her voice . " Is that a problem ? " he asked . " It 's a very white county , " she said . " Not like Pecos at all . " " So ? " " So one feels there might be a problem , if push came to shove . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She smiled , awkwardly . " I can tell you were a cop , " she said . " You ask so many questions . And it 's me who wanted to ask all the questions . " She fell silent for a spell and just drove , slim dark hands light on the wheel , going fast but not hurrying . He used the cushion-shaped buttons again and laid his seat back another fraction . Watched her in the corner of his eye . She was pretty , but she was troubled . Ten years from now , she was going to have some excellent frown lines . " What was life like in the army ? " she asked . " Different , " he said . " Different from life outside the army . " " Different how ? " " Different rules , different situations . It was a world of its own . It was very regulated , but it was kind of lawless . Kind of rough and uncivilized . " " Like the Wild West , " she said . " I guess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first and foremost to do what needed doing . The rules came afterward . " " Like the Wild West , " she said again . " I think you liked it . " He nodded . " Some of it . " She paused . " May I ask you a personal question ? " " Go ahead , " he said . " What 's your name ? " " Reacher , " he said . " Is that your first name ? Or your last ? " " People just call me Reacher , " he said . She paused again . " May I ask you another personal question ? " He nodded . " Have you killed people , Reacher ? In the army ? " He nodded again . " Some . " " That 's what the army is all about , fundamentally , is n't it ? " she said . " I guess so , " he said . " Fundamentally . " She went quiet again . Like she was struggling with a decision . " There 's a museum in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West museum . It 's partly in an old saloon , and partly in the old hotel next door . Out back is the site of Clay Allison 's grave . You ever heard of Clay Allison ? " Reacher shook his head . " They called him the Gentleman Gunfighter , " she said . " He retired , actually , but then he fell under the wheels of a grain cart and he died from his injuries . They buried him there . There 's a nice headstone , with Robert Clay Allison , 1840-1887 on it . I 've seen it . And an inscription . The inscription says , He never killed a man that did not need killing . What do you think of that ? " " I think it 's a fine inscription , " Reacher said . " There 's an old newspaper , too , " she said . " In a glass case . From Kansas City , I think , with his obituary in it . It says , Certain it is that many of his stern deeds were for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The Cadillac sped on south . " A fine obituary , " Reacher said . " You think so ? " He nodded . " As good as you can get , probably . " " Would you like an obituary like that ? " " Well , not just yet , " Reacher said . She smiled again , apologetically . " No , " she said . " I guess not . But do you think you would like to qualify for an obituary like that ? I mean , eventually ? " " I can think of worse things , " he said . She said nothing . " You want to tell me where this is heading ? " he asked . " This road ? " she said , nervously . " No , this conversation . " She drove on for a spell , and then she lifted her foot off the gas pedal and coasted . The car slowed and she pulled off onto the dusty shoulder . The shoulder fell away into a dry irrigation ditch and it put the car at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put the transmission in park with a small delicate motion of her wrist , and she left the engine idling and the air roaring . " My name is Carmen Greer , " she said . " And I need your help .
