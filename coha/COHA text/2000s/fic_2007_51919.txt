S. L. Gilbow 's first published work of fiction was " Red Card " in oui Feb. 2007 issue . In this second story of his , he displays again a deft hand at the sort of social extrapolation that has been one of this magazine 's mainstays for fifty-odd years . ( And long may that trend continue . ) <p> MR . HUDSON IS ON THE Moon , and he knows why he is there-he has lived too long . He is ninety-four . His heart is strong ; his lungs are clean ; his kidneys work just fine . There are no lumps on his skin or tumors in his bowels . His hair is full ; his sight is keen ; his teeth are straight . He is , according to four befuddled geriatricians he has left behind on Earth , in perfect health , and there is little he can do about it . So now he is on the Moon , threading his way through a cluster of tourists down Corridor Fourteen . A bead of sweat crawls down his nose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Dallas assured them maintenance was working overtime to fix the heating problem , but the crowd still grumbles , with an occasional comment on what real service used to be like . Mr. Hudson stops , throws back his head , and reads a banner beaming proudly above him : LUNACY PARK - WHERE GOOD THINGS HAPPEN . " Come along , Daddy , " snaps Laura . She stretches her thin neck forward , plows her way through a mass of stalled travelers and covers thirty more feet of the Moon . " I 'm trying , " calls Mr. Hudson , but Laura does n't hear him . A large man , six-foot-four in his prime , he struggles with the unsettling change in gravity . The compensating boots and belt are useless , but he still manages to gain control of his footing and slip around a meandering couple holding hands - honeymooners he guesses . As he starts to pick up speed , as he begins to think he is getting used to the gravity and the boots and the belt , he loses his balance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pink dress . An old woman , almost as old as Mr. Hudson , she flies backward and hits the ground like a dropped fork . " I 'm - I 'm so .... " hot blood flows to Mr. Hudson 's ears . His breath is short , his face numb . He stands there , gazing at the old woman - her arms outstretched , her legs spread at forty-five degrees , posed as if to make snow angels . Weary tourists have stopped to watch , stopped to glare judgmentally . One jumps back while another , hovering over the old woman , scolds Mr. Hudson : " Look what you 've done . " Laura , now far ahead , has no idea of what has happened . " Daddy , come on ! " " Are you all right ? " asks Mr. Hudson , looking down on the old woman like some ancient giant . The woman in pink wiggles , raises her head , and pushes herself to a sitting position . " What are you doing ? " " Maybe we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am a doctor , " says the old woman , touching the back of her head with two thin fingers . " I 'm fine . " " Are you sure ? " " There 's nothing wrong with me , " she says adamantly . Mr. Hudson offers a large , dark hand , which the old woman reluctantly accepts . He pulls her to her feet , slowly , carefully . He smiles an awkward , self-conscious smile into stern , brown eyes . She is small , but not frail . Her skin is olive and her hair the color of ice . " I 'm sorry , " says Mr. Hudson . " You should be , " says the old woman simply . " Daddy , I 'm not waiting . " Laura , an echo in the distance , has lost all patience . Mr. Hudson nods an ambiguous nod that not even he understands and takes off down the corridor to catch up with Laura . As he dashes away , he hears the old woman , her words faded and incoherent except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Should he have stayed longer ? Should he have been more help ? Should he have asked her name ? By the time he catches up with Laura , his head is spinning with questions . " We would n't be so far behind if we had gotten better seats on the shuttle , " says Laura , stopping at an intersection . A sign points right toward Lunacy Park while another points left to Smooth Passing Incorporated . Mr. Hudson looks to the right . He would love to go to Lunacy Park . He has n't been to a park in thirty years , and now here one is , one simple right turn away . An excited little girl sporting blue curls , her sliver of a hand grasping the cuff of her mother 's coat , hurls herself down the corridor toward Lunacy Park . " Hurry , " she squeals . The mother stumbles after her . " This is where we turn , " says Laura . " Left , I assume , " says Mr. Hudson . " You 're so silly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Danny ? " Danny , Laura 's husband , is far behind them now , almost out of sight , a gray smudge in the distance . Perched on his toes , he looks out at the lunar landscape through one of the small , high , thick windows that dot the corridor . Mr. Hudson glances at a portal nearby and , for the first time , realizes he is almost completely underground . " Danny will catch up , " says Laura . " He always does . " LUNACY PARK has siphoned off most of the visitors ; only a thin ribbon of wandering souls remains . The fast movers are gone now , all except for Laura and Mr. Hudson who spin around a kink in the corridor and come to a sudden stop in front of an enormous holographic sign : SMOOTH PASSING-WE MAKE THE NEXT STEP EASY . Laura , not to be slowed , dashes through the " Easy . " Mr. Hudson , less comfortable with walking through solid-looking objects , slips sideways through the " Make " and steps out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artificial breeze of Smooth Passing Incorporated . Mr. Hudson pulls a tri-fold brochure out of his hip pocket and taps a picture in the center panel . " Welcome to Smooth Passing , " says the brochure as the picture - the very view in front of him - jumps to life : the Smooth Passing Visitors Center in all its splendor ; the reception desk of polished stone ; the modest garden ; The Moonwalk Caf . Golden beams shoot up the dome to support a circular viewing platform near the very top . The platform is crowned by massive dark windows looking out onto the surface of a black Moon . Mr. Hudson finally realizes what the brochure has been trying to tell him , what he has refused to believe : this is one fine place . To the left , a small company of guests lounge around a circle of fountains as two toddlers chase a squirrel up a tree . The squirrel is mechanical and the tree metal , he guesses . It is hard to be sure . Bushes , probably real , emit a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hudson doubts that there are any real birds here , but he looks around to be sure . He does n't see a single one , but he does see the Smooth Passing hallmark display , familiar to anyone who has ever seen a Smooth Passing advertisement . It is an animated poster of a family - a father , mother , and three children - gently hugging a white-haired matriarch . They hug her over and over and over again - about four seconds per hug - and will do so for eternity . Scribed under the poster are the words " We will miss you . " Mr. Hudson wonders if he will get the hugs . " Daddy ! " Laura is ahead of him again . " Go , " he says . " I 'll catch up . " He wishes he had said that sooner . As he takes in the view , a few stragglers filter in , filling up vacant space . To his right , he catches a flash of pink . It is the old woman again . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how sorry he is , to explain that he really is n't a jackass - at least not much of one - at least not the one she thinks he is . But he does n't say anything . He just mouths " I 'm really sorry , " then turns , makes his way past the guests who have moved ahead of him , and joins Laura , already giving the receptionist fits . " I 'm sure it 's there , " barks Laura . " I made the reservations myself . " " Let her look , " says Mr. Hudson , but Laura has never listened to him . " I hate wasting time , " she says . The receptionist , her jaw tight , her face tense with patience , slides her hands over the counter , searching one data-file after another . She is dressed in a red jumpsuit like the ones worn by the early colonists and wears a button on her collar that says , " Making the Next Step Easy . " She flips a strand of limp hair away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , " she finally says . " Severs , right ? " " Three rooms , " says Laura . " You 're here for one passing ? " " Are you having a sale ? " asks Mr. Hudson . Laura jabs him in the side . It is not a playful jab . " That 's right , " she says . " Do you have the passing form ? " Smooth Passing is very clear about filling out the paperwork before you arrive . " Yes , " says Laura , in a bit of a panic . " My husband has it . " Mr. Hudson scans the crowd and sees Danny stepping through the Smooth Passing sign . " Hurry up ! " shouts Laura . Danny does n't hurry ; he never has , not as long as Mr. Hudson has known him . " They need the form ! " calls Laura . Danny ambles to the counter . " You 're always in such a rush , " he says , reaching into the inside pocket of his green jacket . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the receptionist . " We need to review the form , " says the receptionist , her face expressionless . " It 's good , " says Laura . " It 's recommended that I read it aloud . " " We all signed it on Earth , " says Danny . " As a family , " adds Laura proudly . " I still have to ask a few questions , " says the receptionist , following strict protocol . " Have you sought medical assistance on Earth ? " " Oh , yes , " says Laura . " We 've been to four doctors . None of them could find a thing wrong . " " And you 're sure this is what you want . " " We have all talked about it , " says Laura . " Have n't we ? " Mr. Hudson and Danny nod in agreement ; they have indeed talked about it , talked it to death . " It 's what we want , " she says . " Does the document accurately reflect your wishes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Mr. Hudson is startled by the question , but even more startled by the eye-contact . " No , " he wants to say . " I want to ride the Monster Slide into the largest standing pool of water on the Moon . I want to eat Zongo Bars in Lunacy Park till I vomit red goo . " But he does n't say that . He nods and says , " Yes , it 's what I want . " The receptionist turns to Danny . " Do you affirm that the form accurately reflects your wishes ? " She has asked this question a thousand times . Laura glares at Danny . Her eyes close to slits and her chin juts forward . She does n't want any complications now . " I guess I do , " says Danny . The receptionist annotates the form . " Perform the verification then , " she says . Mr. Hudson lays his right hand on a small , ceramic plate . " It looks good , " says the receptionist . Laura and Danny repeat the action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted tomorrow night , " says the receptionist , handing the form back to Danny , who folds it and slips it back into his pocket . " Well , I do n't understand why we have to wait a day , " says Laura . " None of us are going to change our minds . " " It 's official policy , " states the receptionist . " The porter will show you to your room . " An androporter , human looking in torso and head but pragmatically metal and wheels from the waist down , whirls out from behind a bush , signals for them to follow , and leads them to another corridor . Laura , Danny , and the androporter drop Mr. Hudson off at the door to his room . " Get some rest , old man , " says Danny , handing him two pills . Mr. Hudson looks at the pills , a little puzzled . " They 're for nausea , " says Danny . " The gravity change could start to bother you . " Mr. Hudson puts the pills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts to close the door behind him , Laura sticks her thin head between the narrow crack in the open door . " I hope you realize how hard this is on my schedule , " she says . " I do , " says Mr. Hudson . " Now get some sleep , " says Laura . " Tomorrow is a busy day . " Mr. Hudson undresses in the dark , crawls into bed and tries to feel sorry for Laura . But all he can think about is the old woman he ran over , the old woman who will always think he is a jackass . One New Year 's morning , Laura , up earlier than usual , called a family meeting . This was becoming an annual tradition in the Severs household , so Mr. Hudson was n't surprised when he heard his daughter hollering from the kitchen . " Come on , Daddy ; we 're waiting for you . " " I do n't know why we have to do this , " said Danny , poking a skillet of scrambled eggs with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the highlight of Mr. Hudson 's week . " I think I 'm ready to vote , " said Danny . Laura was not amused . " You need to take this seriously , " she snapped . " Daddy 's turning ninety-four next month , and the longevity tax is going to go up another two percent . " " Happy birthday to me , " said Mr. Hudson , shuffling into the kitchen . He took a seat at the kitchen table as Danny set a plate of eggs in front of him . " It just is n't getting any easier , and it 's time we really talk about this . And I do n't mean just joking around like you two always do . " She dropped a canvas bag onto the kitchen table and pulled out a handful of pamphlets . " Here are some Smooth Passing brochures I think we should all look at . " This was new to Mr. Hudson ; Laura did n't usually bring handouts to family meetings . She passed a brochure to Danny and another to Mr. Hudson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Welcome to Smooth Passing , " said the brochure . Laura muted the sound and held the brochure at chest level as if she were holding a prayer book . She cleared her throat , arched her back and began to read : " Smooth Passing Incorporated encourages all families to review their passing plans every year . " She paused to look at Danny and Mr. Hudson , giving it that personal touch . " With the increasing cost of living , not to mention the needless drain on scarce resources , there comes a time when you need to say you ca n't , and probably should n't , live forever . " She paused to let the words sink in . She had obviously rehearsed . " Smooth Passing encourages every family to review their plans at the beginning of each year . After all , you 're already making resolutions . " " My resolution is to live to be one hundred , " said Mr. Hudson . " You 're not getting any younger , Daddy , " growled Laura , pumping her arms up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ digging holes with some invisible shovel . " Do n't you understand ? " " Yes , " whispered Mr. Hudson . He felt bad for joking around after Laura had warned him not to . " I think it 's time , " said Laura , holding the brochure out for Danny to take . " His good years are gone , and I think we all know that . " " I do n't , " said Danny . Mr. Hudson did n't say a word . The whole thing was beginning to wear on him , making him dread every New Year 's Day - no - making him dread every day . He had tried to cooperate . He had been to doctors , four different doctors , only to get the same disappointing response : " Really , he 's fine , there 's nothing we can do . " Laura hated hearing that . " Jack , what do you think ? " asked Danny . " I do n't know anymore , " said Mr. Hudson . " Maybe it 's time . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seizing the opportunity . " We can take him to the Moon where you do n't have to go through all the trouble you do down here . " Laura laid the form out on the table . It was a standard form printed on electronic parchment , official-looking , yet elegant , certainly suitable for framing . " Jack , you do n't have to do this , " said Danny . " He 'll sign , " said Laura . " Daddy 's always had common sense . " " Damn it , Laura , I do n't think it 's time . " " We can at least apply , " pleaded Laura . " Smooth Passing does n't take these things lightly . They wo n't even accept the application unless it 's the right thing to do . " " I 've never heard of them rejecting anyone , " said Danny . " Of course they do , " said Laura . " They carefully review every application . They actually take fourteen factors into account . It says so in the brochure . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to Danny in the most soothing tone he could muster . " And it 's not only age they consider , Daddy , " said Laura , as intense and eloquent as Mr. Hudson had ever seen her . " Age is just one small consideration . They 'll look at a lot of things . They 'll study records from your whole life . And you can cancel at any time . If we all sign , any one of us can cancel . Even on the Moon . " " All right , " said Mr. Hudson . Laura handed the form to Danny . " You need to be part of this too , " she said . " Everything 's always on me . " Danny took the form . " What do you really think , Jack ? Because if you 're not sure .... " Danny 's voice trailed into nothingness . " Let 's get it over with , " said Mr. Hudson . Danny took the form , pulled a pen out of his pocket , and began to write , slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the form and authenticated it by placing his thumb on a tiny stamp next to the signature block . He handed the form to Mr. Hudson who signed it without question . " Well , let 's not draw this out all day , " said Laura . Danny laid the form in front of Laura and pointed to the block for her to sign . She whipped off a quick signature . A metallic block at the bottom of the page flashed red three times and then turned a steady green . " Looks like it took , " said Danny . " Good , " said Laura . " We should have an answer within a few days . " " I 'm not real happy about this , " said Danny . " I do n't care , " said Laura , storming out of the room as Danny folded the form into a neat square and slipped it into his shirt pocket . MR . HUDSON is on the Moon , and he knows why he is there-he has lived too long . It 's not his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to ninety-four . For sixty years he smoked a pipe , three bowls a day of a rich Cavendish tobacco , but that was before he moved in with Laura and Danny . He used to drink too - mostly scotch and brandy . He has had no organ replacements or bodily enhancements . He has never exercised for more than a couple of weeks at a time . He ca n't remember having ever taken a vitamin . But here he is , almost a century old , still plugging along . One more day . One more day on the Moon . Mr. Hudson wakes at eight o'clock , lunar time . Across the room an oval mirror with an antique frame hangs above a sink no more than one large step from the foot of his bed . He had n't noticed how small the room was the night before , but now it seems little more than a tight box . The bed itself takes up a third of the space . Mr. Hudson rises , steps to the mirror , and gazes at his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he says , applying shaving lotion to his whiskers . He watches the stubble melt away , then rinses the film from his face . Mr. Hudson 's suitcase , delivered sometime during the night , stands next to the sink , but he puts on yesterday 's clothes and dons the gravity-compensating boots and belt . He takes one more long look into the mirror and sets out to explore Smooth Passing . Many guests are already up , some moving with purpose down the corridor , others just milling about , looking at faded pictures of the Moon hanging on the walls . Mr. Hudson moves with purpose , now barely aware of the gravity change . As he reaches the end of the corridor , Laura shouts from behind : " Daddy , it 's good to see you . " She rushes to his side . " This is your big day . " " Big day , " says Mr. Hudson . " Danny and I are going for a Moon tour . Do you want to come ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But he is n't ; he is n't tired at all . " We 're going to see where Neil Armstead first stepped on the Moon , " says Laura . " I think I 'll stay around here . " " You should come , " says Danny , joining them . " We should spend this day together . " He lays his hand gently on Mr. Hudson 's shoulder . " Go on , " says Mr. Hudson . " I 'll be fine . " " We would stay with you , Daddy , " says Laura , " but I may never get to the Moon again . " She gives her father a big hug . " We 'll spend some time together tonight . I promise . " " Wonderful , " says Mr. Hudson . " Do be careful , " says Laura , looking around . " There are a lot of people here I do n't trust . " After Laura and Danny leave for their tour , Mr. Hudson steps into the lobby . He follows the perimeter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few androwaiters are laying out breakfast servings . " I 'm looking for a woman , " says Mr. Hudson . " Are n't we all ? " says an androwaiter . Mr. Hudson winces . " I mean a specific woman . " " What is her name ? " " I do n't know , " says Mr. Hudson . " What is she wearing ? " " I 'm not sure . It could be a pink dress . " " How old is she ? " " About ninety or so , I would guess . " " That limits the selections to thirty-four . Would you like to have a porter show them to you ? " " No thanks , " says Mr. Hudson . " I 'll just look around . " Mr. Hudson circles the dome several times , studying every face he meets . Occasionally , he cuts through the heart of the dome to make sure he has left no recess unsearched . He finds a lot of women , several women in pink , and even one old woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is about to go back to his room when he looks up . Mr. Hudson follows " Viewing Platform This Way " signs to a set of stairs beside an elevator . He climbs the stairs faster than any ninety-fouryear-old man should and finally comes to a large deck , bordered by guard rails on one side and an enormous , dark window on the other . Mr. Hudson looks out the window . He knows he is looking onto the surface of the Moon but ca n't make out much except a few blurred shapes . In front of the window , planted in a long trough , grows an immaculate row of small , yellow tulips protected by a glass shell . Between the tulip and the window , scrolls a banner : Smooth Passing is proud to honor Karen fenkins , Gary Falmouth , Amett Jones , and Sarah Birdsong . " So , what do you think ? " asks a voice from behind . Mr. Hudson turns and sees the woman in pink , only she is n't wearing pink now ; she is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be ? " she asks . Mr. Hudson wants to speak , but his tongue is dead and his lips are frozen . The old woman steps to Mr. Hudson 's side and stares out the window . " There they are , " she says with fascination . " Hard to see them , " says Mr. Hudson , finally forcing a few words out . " If you 're having trouble , look away from the glass , " says the old woman . " At least that 's what the brochure says . " Mr. Hudson looks down at the tulips ; one is marred by an orange blemish on one petal . Suddenly four urns pop into focus on the surface of the Moon . They are carved out of stone , tastefully lit by aimed spotlights , and spaced with plenty of room for more urns later . " So what do you think of them ? " asks the old woman . " Who are they ? " " Today 's honorees . " " On the Moon forever ? " asks Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad ? " asks the old woman . " It seems a little out of the way , " says Mr. Hudson . Laura had described the Smooth Passing interment policies to him , but they had n't seemed real until now . " Think of it more as a quiet , secluded spot , " says the old woman . " By the way , my name is Susan , Susan Weiss . " " I 'm Jack , " says Mr. Hudson , and then adds , without even thinking about it , " but I 'm not a jackass . " Susan looks at Mr. Hudson , puzzled . " Did I say you were ? " she asks , considering the possibility . " You did , " says Mr. Hudson , " yesterday . " " Oh , yes , " she says with recognition . " I 'm usually right about those things . I think I 'll need more proof than just your word . " Mr. Hudson lays his hand on the glass shell above the fragile tulip with the blemish . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I really am , but they are hard to get to . " " That 's for protection , " says Susan . " From radiation ? " " From tulip pluckers ; the radiation is n't bad here . " Susan gently strokes the glass shell with one finger . " Besides , you would n't want to pluck these tulips . " " I would n't ? " " They 're special . Called Janet 's Tulips . Named after Smooth Passing 's first customer . " " Lucky her , " says Mr. Hudson . " She brought them with her . I used to plant this kind every fall on Earth . " Susan tugs at the brochure sticking out of Mr. Hudson 's hip pocket . " Did n't you study up before you came ? " " Never got past the opening picture , " says Mr. Hudson . " I was afraid it might spoil the surprises . " " Well I hope you know the ending or you 're in for a real shock . " " I do know the ending , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Hudson is on the Moon , and he knows why he is there - he has lived too long . So has Susan . They descend the stairs and stroll to the garden where , beside copper trees and robotic squirrels , they talk all morning . At noon they eat Crater Salads at The Moonwalk Caf . After sharing an order of apple slices for dessert , they walk some more . They really do n't know where they are going , - they are just going , walking slowly . " How will it happen ? " asks Mr. Hudson . " You mean tonight ? " " Yes . " " I do n't know , " says Susan . " Kind of a trade secret . " " Of course , " says Mr. Hudson . " It wo n't hurt . The form guarantees that . " " I did n't read the form , " says Mr. Hudson . Susan takes Mr. Hudson by the hand . " Come with me , " she says , leading him down a corridor to a set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , unpainted , unvarnished . " What is this place ? " asks Mr. Hudson . " The sign on the door says it can be either a church , a temple , or a pub , " says Susan . " We can go in for fifty an hour . For a hundred you get drinks . " Mr. Hudson searches his pockets . " This should last us for a while , " he says , pulling out his last coin and handing it to Susan . " Make it with drinks . " Susan slides the coin into a slot and presses a button marked " pub . " The sign on the door flashes PLEASE WAIT five times and then changes to a steady ENTER . The pub is a dark , narrow room with a bar on one end and three stark , wooden tables on the other . Short , plump , human-looking figures sit on benches at two of the tables . Four of the figures look like men and three like women , but they all look sad and grotesque , hunched over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " whispers Mr. Hudson . " I guess they 're androdrunks , " says Susan . " Probably for atmosphere . " Mr. Hudson slips by the shortest , ugliest figure and makes his way to the bar where an androtender waits for him , dishtowel draped neatly over one arm . " I 'll have a scotch , " says Mr. Hudson . " On the rocks . " The androtender pours the drink , sets it down in front of Mr. Hudson , and says , " O Grave , where is thy victory ? " " Excuse me ? " asks Mr. Hudson . The androtender puts down the bottle of scotch , picks up a cracked glass , and washes it . " What did you say ? " asks Mr. Hudson . The androtender looks into Mr. Hudson 's eyes . " Earth to earth , " he says . Mr. Hudson turns to Susan . " Should n't he be saying things like " What 'll it be " and " Nice weather we 're having ' ? " " Looks like the wrong soundtrack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last coin . Ca n't even step out and reload the bar . " " Is the drink any good ? " asks Susan . Mr. Hudson sniffs the scotch then sucks a drop onto his tongue . " It 's excellent , " he says . " Then it 's okay , " says Susan , turning to order a gin and tonic . The androtender makes Susan 's drink without a single wasted motion . " I will fear no evil , " he says . Susan takes her drink and sits down at the vacant table where Mr. Hudson joins her . " To health , " says Mr. Hudson , raising his glass . " And long life , " laughs Susan . Susan sips at her drink and stares at the bar . The androtender is back to washing glasses . " Do you fear evil ? " she asks , turning to Mr. Hudson . Mr. Hudson has never been asked this question before , at least not in this way . He thinks about it for a moment and then replies , " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Susan . Early afternoon slips into late evening . Mr. Hudson and Susan have moved all the androdrunks to their table . They are not really programmed for conversation , but they make wonderful listeners with a few appropriate comments : " Ah , yes , I see what you mean - Do go on - I always thought so myself . " " Do you think we have drunk too much ? " asks Susan . " That depends , " says Mr. Hudson . " On what ? " " Do you still think I 'm a jackass ? " Susan considers the question . " Does it really matter ? " she asks . " It does , " he says . Susan thinks for a moment and raises her glass . " To jackasses . " " To jackasses , " toasts Mr. Hudson , " and tulips .

" We 've been looking for you , Daddy , " she says . " It 's getting late , " says Danny . " You probably have n't even had dinner yet . " " I 'm not hungry , " says Mr. Hudson . And he is n't ; he is n't hungry at all . " I think it 's time for Daddy to go to bed , " says Laura . " Just a little longer , " says Mr. Hudson . " We were toasting .

Laura and Danny walk Mr. Hudson back to his room . " How are you feeling , Daddy ? " asks Laura . " I 'm tired , " he says . It is true ; he is tired . " Then you should get some sleep , " says Laura . " I 'll see you in the morning , " he says , without thinking . " No , you wo n't , " says Danny . " You understand that , do n't you ?

He knocks on the door , but there is no answer . " Danny ! " he calls . Nothing . " Danny ! " Nothing . Laura 's room , next to Danny 's , is vacant too . An androporter , busily making his early morning rounds , whizzes by . " Help , " says Mr. Hudson . The androporter slides to stop and turns around . " I 'm looking for Mr. Severs , " pleads Mr. Hudson . The androporter makes quick calculations and , without a word , takes Mr. Hudson to the stairs leading to the viewing platform . At the top of the stairs , Mr. Hudson finds Danny , motionless , looking out a dark window onto the surface of the Moon . " Danny , " says Mr. Hudson , his voice weak and lifeless . " Old man , " says Danny , without turning around . Mr. Hudson moves closer . " It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach out and touch Danny , but he does n't . " What did n't work ? " asks Danny . " Smooth Passing made some kind of mistake , " says Mr. Hudson . " Smooth Passing does n't make mistakes , " says Danny , staring intensely at his own reflection . " I do n't understand , " say Mr. Hudson . " Did you know there were tulips up here ? " asks Danny . " Yes , " says Mr. Hudson , looking down at the perfect row of yellow flowers . Five urns snap into focus on the surface of the Moon . The scrolling banner behind the tulips matches names to urns : Smooth Passing is proud to honor Harold Davis , Philip Gilbert , Susan Weiss , fackie Halloway , and Laura Severs . Mr. Hudson sways , dips low , and almost falls . " Are you all right , old man ? " asks Danny reaching out to catch him . He holds Mr. Hudson tight , straining to lift his enormous bulk . Mr. Hudson stabilizes himself in a crouch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't what she wanted , " he moans . " She signed the form , " says Danny . He loosens one hand from under Mr. Hudson 's left arm , pulls the sheet of electronic parchment out of his pocket , and hands it to Mr. Hudson . Mr. Hudson unfolds the form and reads Laura 's name immaculately printed on a line labeled " Honore . " " You put Laura 's name on the form ? " asks Mr. Hudson . Danny says nothing . " Did she ever know ? " Mr. Hudson can remember Laura signing the form ; it seems clear , as clear as if it has just happened . But did she read it ? For some reason he ca n't remember that . But they had reviewed the form since arriving on the Moon . Had n't they ? " Did she know ? " Mr. Hudson asks again , trying to sort the scattered thoughts spinning around in his head . " Smooth Passing reviews every application , " says Danny , echoing Laura 's words . " They would never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . " Mr. Hudson stands up , steps away from Danny and moves close to the window . He stares out onto the bleak landscape and forces the center urn , Susan 's urn , into focus . It seems a little larger than the others . " Was that your friend from last night ? " asks Danny . Mr. Hudson stares at the delicate flowers carved into the stone urn and says nothing . " She seemed nice , " continues Danny . " She wanted to grow tulips , " whispers Mr. Hudson . " We should grow some tulips when we get home , " says Danny . " If you want to . " " That would be nice , " says Mr. Hudson , turning to stroke the glass above the blemished tulip . " I wonder who brought tulips to the Moon ? " asks Danny . Mr. Hudson turns to look out the window one last time as he and Danny descend the stairs . Mr. Hudson is on the Moon , and he knows why he is there .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
