NO JOE , NO GO What kind of barbarian goes into the woods without being well stocked with tea or coffee ? You suggest we should ( Body Language , December 2000 ) .

Pull up your upper-body clothing to clean your midsection , and so on for the rest of your body . I can wash like this with just a quart of water and a well-worn washcloth , which I also use to pat myself dry .

Decherd , TN THE RULE OF 3S I wish it were true , but I do n't think you can go without food for 3 months ( Body Language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " usually mentions you can live for 3 weeks sans food . Ken Hubbs Boston , MA The information in " The Rule of 3s " originally appeared in the Wilderness Medical Society 's newsletter .
