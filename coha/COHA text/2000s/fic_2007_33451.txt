New Orleans , Louisiana January 1842 " Send a husband for me , I pray , most Holy Mother . Intercede in this matter , if it be thy will , for I have desperate need . " Juliette Armant gripped her fingers tightly together as she stared up at the benign carved face of the statue of Our Lady before her . The prayer bench 's hand rail , polished by countless hands over endless years , felt cold under her wrists , and the chill of the knee rest penetrated her thick skirts of gray cord du roi . The emptiness of the cathedral echoed around her while the scents of ancient dust , incense and smoke from the prayer candles burning on their wrought-iron stand nearby wafted about her face . The fluttering of the flames on their wicks was loud in the stillness . She had knelt here a thousand times before , yet everything seemed strange this morning . " I do n't ask this boon for myself , " she went on with a brief but decided shake of her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To be dedicated to the church at birth was my fate and I accepted it in all humility , truly I did . But now all is changed . I lack the beauty or skill at flirtation to attract a husband and there is no one to arrange a match for me . My mother has not the will -- but you know her trials . I must wed without delay or all will be lost . " Was she doing the right thing ? Juliette wondered . She had tried diligently to find another way out of her peculiardilemma , but nothing that sprang to mind seemed likely to be of use . How had it come down to this when everything should have been so different ? " Oh , Holy Mother , make this husband you will send kind , if it pleases you , yet not too gentle of spirit . He must have strength and a will of steel for he will surely need them . Intelligence would be useful , and diplomacy as well . I do n't ask that he be attractive , still it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon for the sake of our future children . " She closed her eyes with a small moan and went on hurriedly , " No , no , forget I said that . You who know all things must surely understand what is required . Only send a man to me soon , I beg , as quickly as may be possible . " Juliette crossed herself , touched her fist to her lips and heart in quick succession , then pushed to her feet . She could not linger here in the sacred quiet . They would miss her at home , and she had no desire to explain where she had been or why she had left the house without even a maid as chaperone . She might perhaps fob off her mother and twin sister with some tale , but prevarication was not something that came easily after all her years with the nuns . To leave the cathedral , she had to pass the bank of prayer candles glimmering on their stand near the heavy front doors . The draft of her passage seemed to make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the corner of her eye . As she turned her head in that direction , her gaze caught the bright flame from the taper she had set burning just before she knelt to pray . It sprang tall and strong on its wick , many times more brilliant than the rest . Dazzling in its intensity , it bloomed and danced before her like a stalwart golden star . Juliette came to a halt with her breath trapped in her throat . She was not so superstitious as her mother , who had a thousand beliefs , prohibitions and proverbs that ruled her life -- still she could not prevent the frisson that moved over her from the top of her head to the tips of her toes . Was this an omen ? Could it mean her prayer would be answered ? She closed her eyes tightly , crossing herself again . Then she moved on . As she quitted the church her steps were lighter and hope burned as bright in her heart as the candle set aflame for her prayer . Pausing on the stone paving outside , Juliette took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inside her sleeve before searching out a coin for her candle . She had almost forgotten them . How aghast her mother and Paulette would be if she were to be seen on the street with bare hands . Such things had not mattered only two weeks ago . At the convent it had been more important to have willing hands rather than perfectly kept ones . A wry smile touched Juliette 's lips before she sighed and began to tug on the gloves of lavender kid borrowed from her sister . The day promised to be fine . Already , the rays of the rising sun poked shining fingers through the river fog beyond the levee , and the air was soft , almost warm . The steam whistle from a departing river packet moaned , setting off the screaming of monkeys and squawking of parrots from the shop of the birdman down the street . A light breeze brought the odors of mud flats , fish , fermenting molasses and overripe bananas from the dock area , along with the stench of refuse in the gutter that centered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of roasting coffee from the market where vendors were opening their stalls , making ready for the morning shoppers who would soon amble forth with baskets on their arms in search of fresh bread , brioche and croissants . Juliette 's stomach rumbled slightly at the thought , and she wished she dared purchase a few of the goods she could smell from the nearby bakery . That would not do , of course , since it would give away her early-morning outing . Just then , a high-pitched shriek ripped through the morning air . Shrill , desperate , it came from no parrot or monkey , but from a living child somewhere behind her . Juliette swung in a swirl of heavy skirts . She was just in time to see a young boy fling around the corner of the cathedral , running flat out . Hardly more than three years of age , he was slight of body , with a mop of black curls and black eyes blared wide with terror . His short legs churned , his arms pumped and his mouth was wide open as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pavement behind the child . A man burst into view then , racing after him . Of superior height and width of shoulder , his long legs covered the ground with great strides . His face was grim with determination as he gained on his quarry , stretching out a hand to snatch at the back of the boy 's ragged , flapping shirt . The child swerved , evading capture by a hairs-breadth . His new path took him straight toward Juliette . Dodging to one side , he caught a handful of her full skirts as he sped past , spinning her halfway around before taking refuge behind their crinoline-supported width . The gentleman skidded to a halt then lunged to the left around Juliette as she struggled to face him . The boy jumped back the other way , jerking her nearly off her feet . His pursuer feinted to the opposite side . The boy dodged back again . " Stop it ! Cease this at once , " Juliette cried , grasping her skirts to keep from being hauled around yet again . " Stop it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she used to quell young female pupils at the convent school . The effect was gratifying . The child stood still , his narrow chest heaving . The gentleman paused , then straightened to his full height . For an instant , the three of them were silent , sizing up each other with wary regard . The boy 's pursuer recovered first . Sweeping off his beaver hat , he executed a bow of consummate grace . " Your pardon , mademoiselle . I only require to lay hands on that imp of Satan behind you . " His voice -- deep , rich and almost musical in its cadences -- affected Juliette in the oddest way . She could almost feel it wrapping around her , invading her senses , vibrating deep inside her chest . A slow and disturbing heat bloomed in her midsection and spread throughout her body . It was a most peculiar sensation , one she had never before encountered . She stood quite still for a bemused instant , her gaze on the gentleman before her . That he was masculine beauty personified was without question . Lustrous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runaway , covered his head in dense waves that dipped forward onto his brow in an errant curl . His eyes were richly black and edged with thick lashes , which curled at the tips . Dark eyebrows with satanic arches , straight Roman nose and mouth almost sinful in its full and perfect contours formed such a perfect collection of features that Juliette was strongly reminded of engravings she had seen of fallen angels done by Italian masters . She should know him , she thought in distraction , though she was sure they had never been introduced in a formal way . She went about so little on her rare visits home from the convent , mainly to the entertainments given by the family or their friends , that her circle of acquaintance was small . Still some dim memory teased her . The gentleman returned her gaze , his own darkly appraising as he allowed it to drift over her face , then flick downward over the curves of her shoulders and breasts under their dull covering . It was done so quickly that she might not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent upon him . Still , she felt it like a tingling caress , felt the peaks of her breasts tighten as if with chill , though she was sure the effect was merely the unusual nature of that regard . Most men of her acquaintance would have been well aware of how inappropriate such a thing was where she was concerned . Or that it had been until recent events , she reminded herself . Noting , perhaps , the fresh wave of hot color across her cheekbones , the gentleman turned his attention back to the boy who still clung to her , taking a step toward him . " Non , mais , non , " the little one cried out , dragging her from her reverie with his lisping protest . " I not go wit ' you ! " " You will if you know what 's good for you , " the gentleman said grimly as he resettled his hat on his head . " Non , non , non ! " " I 'll give you a bonbon --  " " You gi ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy 's voice rose to a hysterical edge . The gentleman feinted to one side of Juliette , then plunged to the other with a lithe twist of his body . He grabbed for the boy 's thin arm , and would surely have had him if he had not shrieked and plunged backward , falling on his small bottom . " Monsieur , " Juliette said with force as she stepped in front of the child , " it will be very much better if you try the effects of reason instead of frightening your son . " " What will be better is if you step aside . " The gentleman barely glanced at her as he bent down , snatching at the boy 's legs as he scooted backward . " Do n't let ' im get me , do n't , do n't , do n't ... "
