<p> NEW YORK  --  Some of the media ownership rules now under review at the Federal Communications Commission might strike consumers as technical and remote . <p> But everyone agrees that one decision regulators plan to make this spring could dramatically affect the quantity and quality of some of the most important TV programming : local news , public affairs and sports . <p> The agency must figure out what to do with a rule that bars owning TV stations that collectively reach more than 35% of the 106.7 million U.S. television homes . <p> The decision could be a kind of Gettysburg in a long-running civil war between major TV networks , which also own stations , and their independently owned affiliates . For more than a decade , they 've fought about everything from the networks ' payments to stations to affiliates ' right to refuse to air certain programs . <p> Disney 's ABC , Viacom 's CBS , News Corp . ' s Fox and General Electric 's NBC want the 35% cap raised  --  or killed  --  so they can buy more stations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play , possibly even survival . Stations are where the money is in TV . <p> The major networks  --  which have lost market share to new broadcast and cable rivals  --  want the high margins stations can generate and greater economies of scale . <p> " If I ca n't grow , yet all my costs grow , how do I compete ? " asks Viacom Television Stations Group CEO Fred Reynolds . " I have shareholders who expect a good return . Yet , this is free , over-the-air television . You do n't have to spend a dime to see the Super Bowl , CSI , ER or coverage of the Columbia tragedy . " <p> The issue is immediately vital to Viacom and News Corp . They 're over the 35% limit and would probably have to sell stations if the cap is n't raised . <p> But the networks face a diverse army of foes . Independent station owners have been joined by Hollywood producers , advertisers and consumer advocates . They say that previous decisions that allowed networks to buy additional stations have given their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If networks win the freedom to buy even more , these critics say , they 'll limit viewers ' programming choices , ignore local tastes , and raise ad prices . <p> " There 's a deep and well-founded concern that the networks , at 35% , have enough power , " says the National Association of Broadcasters Executive Vice President Jeff Baumann . <p> The networks even get a pie in the face from comic Jerry Lewis , whose annual Labor Day Telethon raises money to fight muscular dystrophy . Since few network-owned stations carry the telethon , letting networks buy more big stations would force him to " move the show to smaller independent stations , something that would devastate our audience and income , " Lewis wrote to FCC Chairman Michael Powell . " This loss would mean fewer clinics , less research and far less hope for ' my kids . ' " <p> The FCC , however , is in a tough spot . While the agency itself set most of the limits it 's reviewing , Congress raised the station cap to 35% from 25% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that law , also required the FCC to review media ownership rules every other year and to modify or throw out the ones it ca n't justify . <p> Last year , a federal appeals court ruled the FCC had failed to justify the 35% cap and ordered it to do so . <p> " If we do nothing , the court is going to vacate the rules  --  they blow them up , " says FCC Media Bureau Chief Ken Ferree . " The court seems to be demanding that we have plausible evidence to back up the theory . " <p> Specifically , if they want to keep a station ownership limit , regulators will have to demonstrate that whatever limit they set best serves local communities . The result might not be a fixed number like today 's nationwide 35% . <p> " There might be a different path , " Ferree says . " We may well adopt a different rule . " For example , Powell is intrigued with the idea of creating an index that would determine , market by market , whether a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase <p> However the decision is structured , the smart money is betting the FCC will , in effect , raise the cap to about 45% . That has interested some investors in potential sellers , including Belo , E.W. Scripps , LIN and Hearst-Argyle . <p> Those who support the current cap say any sort of relaxation will make localism its first casualty . <p> " The networks have to protect their program schedule , the programs  --  because they usually own a piece of them  --  and international sales , " says Post-Newsweek Stations President Alan Frank . " We have a local license to be responsible for what goes on the air . " <p> The difference in priorities results in frequent skirmishes . For example , the NAB says : <p> * NBC affiliates objected in 2000 when the network insisted they air the first game in baseball 's American League Division Series instead of the first presidential debate between George Bush and Al Gore . NBC backed down . <p> Local owners also objected when NBC insisted that they broadcast its XFL football games live , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also a concern with the 2002 Olympics . <p> More recently , stations objected to what they saw as sexist promotions for Fear Factor and Dog Eat Dog , violence in the crime drama Kingpin and a short-lived plan to air liquor ads . <p> * CBS stations cried foul last fall when the network wanted to air the Victoria 's Secret Fashion Show at 8 p.m. , a time lots of kids typically watch TV . The network moved it to 9 p.m . <p> The stations also are in an ongoing battle about whether they or CBS should control the slot occupied by its low-rated The Early Show . <p> * ABC has had similar fights . It scaled back the nudity and obscenities in NYPD Blue after affiliate protests when the show premiered in 1993 . Stations have also questioned whether the network kept its low-rated Once and Again on the air to accommodate Disney , which produced the show . <p> Hollywood producers have entered the fray because they 're afraid of being frozen out if network clout grows . Independent studios provided just 17 hours of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearly 47 hours a decade ago , before the federal government allowed broadcasters to own shows they air . <p> Producers fear that if the networks own more stations , they 'll simply run a lot of their parent company 's homegrown productions in the hours under station control , particularly the late afternoon and early evening . <p> That could be devastating . Producers ' real profit from sitcoms and dramas comes from selling reruns to local stations in the syndication market . <p> " We run the risk of eliminating small businesses , " says Tom Fontana , who produced St. Elsewhere , Homicide : Life on the Street and Oz . " We run the risk of limiting original thought and the freedom of expression . I 'm no prophet , but to me , these risks are far too great . " <p> Some journalists also worry that networks will further trivialize local news by pushing stations to air more entertainment and celebrity stories or pieces based on themes introduced in their primetime shows . <p> An analysis of networks ' morning national newscasts by the Project @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " We saw a tendency at all the networks to promote their own company 's products over others , " says Amy Mitchell , associate director . " For example , CBS is more likely to promote a Viacom product than a Disney product . And the disclosure was slim to none . It certainly raises the question of what happens if there 's further consolidation . " <p> Networks scoff at the suggestion that they 're remote Goliaths trying to crush local Davids . They say large and equally remote media companies  --  including Tribune , Gannett ( parent of USA TODAY ) and Cox  --  own the most desirable independent stations . <p> As for affiliate independence , they say they ca n't twist the arms of such powerful companies  --  and would be crazy to even try . A popular affiliate can demolish a network 's ratings and ad sales by switching sides . For example , CBS says it 's still recovering from when it had to scramble in 1994 to replace 15 big affiliates that switched to Fox . <p> " No network is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon itself in that period by not maintaining productive business relationships with its affiliates , " says CBS Executive Vice President Martin Franks . <p> Nor , the networks say , can they afford to alienate viewers by ignoring local concerns . If anything , they say , they serve local interests better than most affiliate owners . They cite an FCC study finding that network-owned stations in 2000 aired more local news and beat affiliates in journalism awards . <p> " We feel very strongly about news , " Reynolds says . " We give ( our ) stations the resources and all the tools they need . I have no interest in commercializing news . " <p> Along the same lines , he points to a network-commissioned study that found that their stations pre-empted network primetime programming almost as much as affiliates do . And they say the extra time that affiliates take often goes to paid programming and telethons  --  not local public affairs . <p> As far as the independent producers go , the networks say it 's not their fault that so many are out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocked to reality shows such as Fear Factor and The Bachelor . Reality programs hold four spots out of the 10 most popular shows in the TV season that began in September . <p> Top independent producers would n't touch reality shows , the networks say , because there 's virtually no opportunity to sell reruns . Critics say the networks like the shows because they 're cheap , but networks face the same economics in producing the shows . Audience demand is the main driver for the reality craze . <p> " It is estimated that only two of the four major networks and neither of the two new broadcast networks ( UPN and WB ) made a profit on their primetime schedules in the just completed 2001-2002 broadcast year , " says CBS ' chief researcher David Poltrack . What those who want to limit network clout " characterized as a ( reality ) windfall has turned out to be merely self-preservation . " <p> Those who want to keep the restrictions do n't buy the doomsday talk . <p> " It may not be boom time for broadcasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research . " There 's nothing to support the idea that they 're going to go under . " <p> But some analysts agree that the network giants , at least as we know them , could collapse without more help . <p> " It 's now or never , " says UBS Warburg 's Lee Westerfield . " If rules do n't change in 2003 , the risk is that free , over-the-air television fades into non-existence in five to 10 years . The issue is n't broadcast networks vs . TV stations . It 's broadcasting vs. pay television . "
