<p> In midsummer , the northern Gulf of Mexico , where the Mississippi River empties into it , may shimmer like any other swath of sea . But a few score feet below , bottom-dwelling fish and other creatures struggle just to breathe . <p> This area - one of the world 's biggest coastal " dead zones " - is rapidly being joined by a growing number of " hypoxic , " or oxygen-depleted areas around the world . At least 146 such zones have been documented through 2000 - from the northern Adriatic Sea to the Gulf of Thailand to the Yellow Sea , according to a United Nations Environment Program ( UNEP ) report released in March . And their number has been doubling every decade since 1960 , it adds . At risk : coastal fisheries near the most populous regions . <p> A handful of efforts are under way that could mitigate the effects . But because of lag times involved , the problem is likely to get worse before it gets better . <p> " I 'm convinced this is going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the 21st century , " says Robert Diaz , a marine biologist and professor at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science , who coauthored the study undergirding the UNEP report . " It wo n't take too much for these annual lower-oxygen events to expand throughout the year and actually eliminate fisheries . " <p> Dead zones often grow where populations grow . But the real driver is the spread of nitrogen , many observers say , caused by runoff of nitrogen-based fertilizers , sewage outflows , and nitrogen deposits from burning fossil fuels . Some waters remain oxygen-depleted year-around . In other waters , the problem appears periodically . <p> In the northern Gulf of Mexico , one of the best-known and best-studied dead zones , hypoxia occurs seasonally from April to September . The zone 's size depends on the weather and how much flow the Mississippi brings each year . Its waters are laden with fertilizer runoff from farms and lawns across the Midwest . Sewage and fossil-fuel emissions exhaust ( from power plants and autos ) are also factors , says a 1999 University of Alabama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combined with placid summer weather results in an oxygen-poor bottom layer of water . The process works this way : In the top layer , the nitrogen and sun feed phytoplankton , which grow rapidly , then die and fall to the bottom . As they decay , they consume oxygen . Called eutrophication , the cycle depletes oxygen in isolated bottom waters . In 2002 , one of the worst years since it was first documented in the 1970s , the northern Gulf 's hypoxic zone reached more than 7,700 square miles . Despite its size , the problem is largely hidden from view , except to the trained eye . <p> " I see massive schools of stingrays , bottom dwellers , moving on the surface . Even shrimp come up 20 feet or so off the bottom trying to get to oxygen , " says Nancy Rabalais , a marine biologist at the Louisiana Universities Marine Consortium in Chauvin , La . Only because they are desperate to breathe do such bottom-dwelling creatures flee upward , risking becoming easy prey . <p> More mouths to feed <p> Such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As populations grow , nitrogen and phosphorous-caused eutrophication will more than double in coastal areas by 2050 , predicts a 2001 study published in Science magazine . <p> " There 's been a big increase in these hypoxic zones that correlates strongly with increased use of nitrogen fertilizers , particularly in the ' 60s and 1970s , " says Robert Howarth , a coauthor of the Science study and professor of environmental biology at Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y . " About half of the nitrogen fertilizer used on Earth in all of history has been used in the last 15 years . " <p> One positive trend : Total global fertilizer use seems to be growing more slowly than in the past few decades . It plateaued in 1990 then declined after the collapse of the Soviet Union . In the mid- ' 90s , global growth resumed , but much more slowly . For the decade , nitrogen fertilizer rose only slightly from 79 million to 82 million tons . <p> Still , scientists say it takes time for a rise in fertilizer use to harm coastal ecosystems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that falling levels of dissolved oxygen in coastal waters lagged 10 to 20 years behind increased chemical fertilizer use beginning in the 1940s . That lag effect is worrisome , he says , because fertilizer use has more than quadrupled globally since 1960 . <p> The use of nitrogen has increased , too . Nitrogen fertilizers were 37 percent of all fertilizers used in 1961 , but grew to 60 percent by 2001 , according to Fertilizer Institute data . " If you look globally at what humans are doing to the nitrogen cycle , we 're increasingly making nitrogen available to the environment , " Dr. Howarth says . " Almost 75 percent of the increase is through fertilizers . " <p> The fertilizer industry in the US has been working with farmers to reduce fertilizer overuse and resulting runoff since the 1960s . But pressure from the Environmental Protection Agency in the ' 90s also has pushed the industry toward new technologies . Global positioning satellite technology , linked to fertilizer applicators on tractors , permits " precision farming " in which each acre gets specific chemicals according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't necessarily get more crop , and farmers understand that it 's not good for their bottom line , " says Rino Maddalena of the Fertilizer Institute in Washington D.C. <p> Even so , several farm authorities say it is not uncommon for farmers to use more nitrogen and other fertilizers than they need as a modest insurance policy . Better to slightly overfertilize than underfertilize and underproduce , the thinking goes . <p> To address this concern , the American Farmland Trust ( AFT ) , a nonprofit group that attempts to protect cropland , has developed a new form of crop insurance . The risk-management program encourages farmers to apply less nitrogen fertilizer . In this scheme , a farmer agrees to use a lesser amount of nitrogen fertilizer , based on nutrient management advice . If the farmer 's output falls below the output of a test plot on his land that has the maximum nitrogen fertilizer applied to it , then he receives the difference in cash . <p> So far , 27 pilot projects are under way in Minnesota , Wisconsin , Ohio , and Illinois @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Innovation Center . In three years , the project has seen a 24 percent reduction in nitrogen use among the farmers . Only a handful saw yields fall . They were paid the difference , about $ 6 per acre . <p> It pays to use less <p> One participant , Burley Hall , a farmer with 2,100 acres north of Urbana , Ohio , now uses some 35 pounds less nitrogen per acre of corn - a reduction of more than 20 percent . That reduction saves him money . And once , when his crop came in a fraction of a bushel less than his test strip , he got reimbursed $ 900 . But his enthusiasm for the program runs deeper than economics . <p> " We 've got creeks that run through our land , " Mr. Hall says . " We live here and drink the water . If I 'm buying this stuff nitrogen , I do n't want to see how far down the stream I can run it . You 've got to watch out for the environment by all means and this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high-tech idea in the works would take another big whack at nitrogen use - but from the other end of the equation . Arcadia Biosciences in Davis , Calif. , is working to make corn and other plants more efficient users of nitrogen already in the soil . For example , using genetic engineering , it has modified canola with a gene found in barley . The effect is to activate the plant 's roots to absorb nitrogen more aggressively than before . <p> " We 've grown the same yield as a conventional crop of canola using less than half as much nitrogen , " says Eric Rey , the firm 's president . <p> Arcadia has conducted three years of tests for the US Department of Agriculture . But the first commercial canola and rice seeds wo n't be ready until 2008 or 2009 , Mr. Rey says . He acknowledges , too , current concerns over genetic engineering . On the other hand , farmers cut costs and use less fertilizer , he adds . " So the environment is improved by farmers making more money . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monitor
