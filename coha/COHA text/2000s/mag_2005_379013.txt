Now that every branch of the U.S. military sponsors a stock-car team , the armed services are looking to NASCAR for more than just a recruiting vehicle . Some of the techniques and equipment perfected on the tracks could easily benefit the Pentagon 's trucks and aircraft . For starters , Carlson Technology , which advises teams on how to shave seconds off pit stops , and Roush Industries , which manages nine teams  --  including one sponsored by the Army National Guard  --  have shown the Army 's National Automotive Center , near Detroit , how to reduce significantly the time it takes to change out the engine on a humvee . The Army could also use transponders similar to the ones NASCAR installs in cars to track their positions in a race , so military commanders can monitor all their vehicles on the battlefield . And amid an Army investigation into a recent spate of rollovers in Iraq that may have been caused by tacked-on , top-heavy armor , the service hopes to build on NASCAR engineering to reduce rollovers for the next generation of vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NASCAR ingenuity already deployed in Iraq : the layers of clear plastic sheets on the front of race-car windshields , which crews can quickly tear off each time oil or grit obstructs the driver 's view . Similar Mylar sheets are now used on Black Hawk helicopters , whose windshields in the past had to be routinely replaced after getting pitted by desert sand . A set of layered sheets , which costs $1,100 , is a lot cheaper than the $15,000 windshields . Could an invasion of flashy logos be far behind ?
