In the Hand of Dante By Nick Tosches Time Warner Nick Tosches , Inc . LOUIE PULLED OFF HIS BRA AND THREW IT down upon the casket . There was residue on his hands . He hated that . He held forth his hand to the one bitch who ws still on her knees . She closed her eyes and licked the scum from his hand . As he stood over her , he could smell her hair , which had the same dirty cloying stench of that coconut-oil shit those fucking Haile Selassie cabbies used inside their taxis . And he could feel the sticky grease of whatever cheap shit she wore on her lips . He withdrew his hand from her . Downstairs , on West Twenty-sixth Street , he stood awhile in the night . It was the dead of August , that time in New York when the daylight sky was an oppressive lowlying glare of white , and the dark of night was a haze of starless ashen pallor . Louie felt at one with it . He lighted a cigarette and drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Humidity and his own sweat began to gather on his skin . He looked at the moist glistening amid the hair of his bare forearm . He looked longer at the hand that held the cigarette . He did n't know which was worse , the traces of his own detested bodily fluid or the slime of that bitch 's tongue . This would clean him , he told himself , feeling the gathering of humidity and sweat increase . All he needed now was a good breeze from the river . That would be nice . He began to walk . He had not tucked his shirt into his trousers , and he had not buttoned his shirt , and he did not do these things now . He carried his jacket of fine , fine cotton and fine , fine silk , the one that he had paid two grand for in Milano . It had been made for him , by whatever the fuck his name was . It was the color of the deep blue-green sea , and was almost weightless ; but as he carried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one pocket . It was his favorite jacket . It was like wearing nothing , and you could wear it with anything , and only a guy with class would see it for what it was . And it was the color of his eyes . Broads loved his eyes . Even now , even now that he was an old fuck , the broads still loved his eyes . Some were scared of them , but some loved them . Louie paused a moment when he reached the corner of Sixth Avenue . He lighted another cigarette . He turned downtown . He kept on walking . Yeah , sixty-three fucking years old last May . And here he was , walking down the avenue like a kid . He liked to walk , at night , alone , even in this heat . It was nice . These nigger punks passing him by in the street : they got nothing on me , he told himself . It was true . It really was . It was like the man said . You 're only as old as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : that broad with no arms . He thought of that job in St. Louis : that son of a bitch would not go down . May . April . March . February . January . December . November . October . September . August . Well , ai n't that a fucking pisser . He was conceived in this fucking weather . Who the fuck would fuck in this weather ? Without even no fucking air-conditioning ? Jesus Christ . But what the fuck was he talking about ? He used to fuck in this fucking weather . Without no fucking air-conditioning . Yeah . He remembered those smacking sounds , that puddle of sweat in what's-her-name 's belly , him coming down on her hard and fast , endless fucking hours , his own sweat-drenched gut coming up from that pool in her belly with a loud fucking smack , again and again , faster and faster , harder and harder , louder and louder , like the suction blast of a goddamn force-cup plunger unclogging a fucking toilet bowl . Yeah , maybe he was getting old , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why he did n't mind this heat , this stillness of dead , heavy air that others could not take . Yeah . Conceived in August . Sixty-three years ago . No . Sixty-four years ago . What the fuck had he ever conceived ? It had all ended up on his right hand or in some cunt 's yap . Dead-baby juice . And now it was too late . Born alone , die alone . He was better off that way . Shit , knowing him , he 'd pay some broad to hold his hand when he died . Money bought anything . He made it to Fourteenth Street before he knew it . More niggers , more spics . Shit , in the old days you would n't see a nigger below Fourteenth Street . Then the basketball courts , the Jew cunts who go for the dark meat ; next thing you know , it ai n't a fucking neighborhood , it 's a fucking nigger dumping ground . But he did n't blame the fucking niggers . Who would n't rather fuck some kike bitch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a goddamn nigger broad ? Who would n't rather be here than there ? The trouble was , these days , here was there . But , no , he did n't blame the niggers . He blamed these white motherfuckers who had come in from the sticks with their nigger-loving ways . They deserved what they got . And he blamed it on the cops . He remembered when the neighborhood kids had taken pipe-cutters to those basketball poles . He remembered when the neighborhood kids had taken baseball bats to those nigger skulls . In the old days , the cops would have covered for them . But these cops now , they were different . They were n't from here . They were from those fucking cop suburbs , and they did n't know shit about nothing . They did n't even know where the fuck they were . They were worse than the niggers. fuck them . Now that there were no more neighborhoods , no more neighborhood ways , no more neighborhood people , fuck these white assholes . He was with the niggers . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt good . No , fuck them all . He was n't with nobody . He kept walking . There was a pang of pain in the groin muscle that he had pulled more than a year ago . It was like it had never really healed right . It hit him every once in a while , like a knife , on the inside of his right thigh , just below his crotch . You get older , things do n't heal fast . He crossed Bleecker Street to Carmine Street . The humidity and his sweat were heavy on him now . He made the sign of the cross on his forehead with his thumb as he passed Our Lady of Pompeii , and the humidity and sweat on his forehead felt like holy water to his thumb . He ambled to the other side of the street , to a shit restaurant with an ugly paint job . It was closed , and the kid was inside by himself , sitting at a table with some paperwork and a drink . Louie rapped on the door . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came fast to unlock the door . " Makin ' the rounds , my friend ? " the kid said . His voice and manner lay between deference and fake casual cheer . He was about thirty-five , with beady eyes and a moustache . " Do n't call me that . " At these words , the fake casual cheer faltered for a moment , and Louie let it falter in silence . He turned away from the kid and strode to the table where the kid had been sitting . He draped his fine , fine jacket over a chair , then he sat , pushed aside some of the paperwork , and lighted a cigarette . " Give me a drink and an ashtray . " The kid went behind the bar . The fake casual cheer had returned to his manner , but it was more subdued . " We got this new grappa . It 's great . " He raised some stupid-looking fancy-ass tall tapered bottle for Louie to see . " fuck you . Save that shit for the suckers . Just give me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fuck the ashtray . I 'll use the floor . " The kid came to him with the drink and an ashtray . He set them before Louie , and he sat with him . " How 's life ? " the kid said . Louie stared at the kid 's moustache . The kid must have grown it in the year or so since he had seen him last . " Back in the old days , when I was a kid , the old-timers used to say the bigger the moustache , the bigger the man . " The fake casual cheer again grew unsettled . " Now , these days , I see a guy with a moustache , I figure he 's either a cop or a faggot . Or both . " " I guess I better shave it off then , huh , Lou ? " he said with what remained of his unsettled fake casual cheer . " Nah . " Louie waved his hand and shrugged with a grimace . " Leave it . Your father 's a cop , right ? Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suits you . The moustache . " The kid said nothing , for there was nothing that he could say . Being Louie had its privileges , and Louie indulged them often . He crushed out his cigarette , drank , and spoke again . " You know , your uncle 's a real fuck-up . I mean , do n't get me wrong . You 're a fuck-up too . But you 're small change . Your uncle , he 's a real fuck-up . He had this joint , did good for a while , pissed everything away gamblin ' . He comes cryin ' to my friends . They help him out . He keeps fuckin ' up . He 's runnin ' cryin ' to the bank over here to cover his checks to Con Ed every third time he gets a shut-off notice . My friends do n't like that . Your uncle is one sick stupid fuck . And that is all that he is . " Louie looked at the kid 's paperwork , which was mostly racing charts and scribblings . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigarette , smiled faintly . " Now that I think of it , he 's got a moustache too . Maybe God did n't give him that walk of his for nothin ' . " He drank . " Anyway . " He pulled the weight from his pocket and laid it on the table : a Walther PPK nine-millimeter semi-automatic pistol in a sealed plastic sandwich bag . The kid saw a black gun about six inches long in what appeared to be a crumpled evidence bag . " Do n't you think you ought to put that away ? " he said . " What if some cop walks by and looks in ? " Louie sneered . " When 's the last time you seen a cop walk ? They do n't walk no more . They go to the gym like the rest of these fruits , but they do n't walk . Shit , the last cop I seen walkin ' a beat , it was a broad . About five foot two , this butch haircut that came up to my belly-button ; looked like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little bumps on her face and everything . New York 's finest . Like your old man : a worthless ugly little c-t . " The kid no longer looked Louie in the eyes . No one knew Louie , not really , except maybe Louie and except maybe his boss , but everyone knew not to fuck with Louie ; and everyone , except maybe Louie and except maybe his boss , feared him without really knowing why . " Anyway . My friends , they figure that if I throw a scare into this piece-of-shit uncle of yours , maybe he 'll get the message . " The kid nodded uneasily , and he offered to get Louie another drink . " Take it easy , " Louie told him . " It 's like the great Buddha said : Moderation in all things . The Eightfold Path . " He sneered at the kid 's moustache . " You ever take it up the ass ? You ought to try it sometime . Might make a man out of you . " He looked at the kid 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes that had never been there before . But he was getting tired , and enough was enough . He looked at the cigarette he was smoking . There were a few drags left , and he took them . He ground out the cigarette . " So , " he said . It was more like a heavy , weary sigh than a sound of any meaning . " Like I say , you and your uncle , you 're two of a kind . Two little lyin ' degenerate cocksuckers . And I know you been robbin ' him , sellin ' the stock to other joints , a few bottles here , a few bottles there . Chickenshit stuff . Nickels and dimes . But , then again , you 're a chickenshit little cocksucker . You rob just like your father , who 's another chickenshit little cocksucker . " He paused , drank the last of his drink . The melting ice felt good on his lips . " Your mother , God rest her soul " - he wiped at his lips with the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a very good one at that . " He looked for anger in those beady eyes , but that anger was occluded by fear . Louie tilted his head slightly , studying the rest of the kid 's face . " You 're funny-lookin ' , you know that ? How 'd you get a broad to marry you ? She must be a worse fuckin ' loser than you . I never seen her . Your kids neither . I never seen them . You got a picture ? " The kid withdrew his wallet . Louie snatched it from his hand . He removed the money that it held-it was not much-and he stuck it in his own pocket . " Is this her ? " The kid nodded . " We love each other , " he said , as if he meant it . Scared people say the stupidest shit . Louie glanced at the picture . " Yeah . She 's funny-lookin ' too . Yeah . You look like one of them , what do you call them , one of them things that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , yeah , one of them ferrets . And she looks like a pig . Can she suck cock at least ? I mean , any better than your mother could ? " He looked at another picture , a picture of a young boy and a younger girl . He seemed to ponder it . " You cross a donkey and a horse , you get a mule . I guess this is what you get when you cross a ferret and a pig . How old 's the little girl ? " " She 'll be ten next month . " " Like I said , I never met them , your wife , your kids . Maybe I should take a ride out to Jersey one of these days and pay my respects . I could find out if your wife sucks cock any better than your mother . And what did you say , the girl was ten ? You know , it 's funny , the older you get , the younger you like your meat . " He drew phlegm from his lungs into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he drew more phlegm from his lungs , and he spat into the face of the kid . The kid began to cry as he wiped the phlegm from his face with a table napkin . " What is it you want me to do ? " he said . " Two things . First-and like the arresting officer says : think about this before you answer , because it may be the most important answer you ever give in your life-how much money is in this shit-hole right now ? " " Just the take from tonight . About twelve hundred . " " That 's pathetic . " " It 's all credit cards these days . " " How much of this twelve hundred did you already dip into ? " " You took it . " " Empty your other pockets too . " The kid put about a hundred and eighty dollars and some coins on the table . Louie took it and put it in his pocket . " Now , where 's that twelve hundred ? " " In the kitchen . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid rose . The kid began walking , to the left of the bar , to the narrow passage that led to the kitchen . He could feel Louie close behind him : very close behind him . On the kitchen wall , there was a cheap ugly picture in a cheap ugly frame : one of those Virgin Mary things that these kitchen spics went for . " How come they call all these shit joints Italian restaurants ? " Louie snorted . " I mean , you ca n't find a wop in any one of these fuckin ' kitchens . They 're all fuckin ' Dominicans , Ecuadorians , this , that , the other fuckin ' thing . These ai n't fuckin ' Italian restaurants , none of them . They 're fuckin ' spic joints . Who eats this shit , anyway ? Jews ? " The kid raised his arm and reached behind the picture and removed an envelope and turned to give it to Louie , who held in his right hand the gun in its plastic bag , and who with his left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket . The kid did not ask about the second of the two things that Louie wanted him to do . " Now , remember what we were talkin ' about-about makin ' a man out of you ? Get on your fuckin ' knees . " " Lou , please , I 'll do anything you want me to do , but- " " Then just fuckin ' do it . " Continues ... by Nick Tosches Excerpted by permission .
