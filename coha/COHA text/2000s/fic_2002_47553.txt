DREAMA WO N'T VISIT NOW on account of the accident part . That bitch . So on visitors ' afternoon I just watch dirty shadows the window bars make across the wall of my cell . There 's voices all over the prison , penitentiary they call it , all the whispers . The sun 's a fire , we know that . It 's the dragon , and Lord , I love it , but not from here . <p> They caught me because I had to watch . It 's like somebody snatched me around and said , " You ca n't look away , you ca n't leave . " Under the streetlight , why did n't somebody else look like a burner ? I shouldn't 've lit the church where I was working , I know , shouldn't 've kindled up my own nest , but every day I wondered what shape the flames would make . They caught me quick . They did n't even wait a minute to click their silver-colored cuffs on my wrists . I could n't feature that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Arsonist " : that 's their word . <p> She got the waitress job at Howard Johnson first , day shift , and I stayed home studying Regis and Oprah , but I had the itch to get out . West Virginia was weeks and miles behind me , an empty warehouse on the edge of town , a bad memory I was growing past , a habit I was free of . I sat on a hill by the railroad ravine on that last Wheeling evening and saw the useless wood burning up to heaven . I had a job washing filth from cars on a lot . I bought her the scarf so red it could have beat a fire truck . It all comes back to that . She packed us up , slamming things around , and said , " You could n't stop yourself . I understand . Next time , Elton , you got to keep telling yourself , ' I wo n't , I wo n't . ' " She 'd tickle me and make me laugh . She might 've almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed somebody to remind me : Old warehouses are a trap wanting to be big hawk-feather flames , waiting to lure me in . <p> When she found me , I was living in bins . My brother stuck a candle in the mule 's skull and tapped on my window . Scared me to death . Travis in the paint store paid me a dollar to touch his thing . That was bad . Fire jumped in flower colors , daffodils and violets , in our gas heater that hissed . Behind the glowing shields , the dragon was keeping us from freezing . Tommy and Dub Stevens said pissing on the volt fence would make you feel good . When I arced my water , a light knocked me unconscious . I was scorched . My daddy never spared the strap . When Mama hit a rattlesnake with the push mower , bits went all over like sparks . How I stepped on a fang nobody could tell , but I upchucked and went into fevers . Mama put the onion on it , then ice , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lawyers say . Fire is free and nobody beats it , so I lit out , lived on my own till she came along . <p> Dreama 's manager , Mike Brattle , set it up , the Last Chance Baptist Church needing a night cleaning man after the choir practice and prayer meetings , the youth groups and mission committee and Bible study . I liked all that . I wore the orange coveralls like somebody hunting , working in the woods and being safe from rifles . My name on the pocket . People coming in said " howdy , " but I mostly had the place to myself , and I could make it shine . The colored glass sometimes caught light that made it look afire already , the polished hardwood near about yellow . That kept the bad seed in my mind . <p> I liked him , though , Deacon Mike . He showed me the closet with mops and cleaners , all the rags I 'd ever need . Linseed , bleach , Comet . When he wrote down what solutions went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He liked the " cleanliness next to godliness " thing and said it a lot , but he never tried to save me from anything but goo and strong liquids that 'd eat your skin off like an alien movie . So I was sorry for him . <p> I took a nap back where they kept the hymnbooks and old broke-up furniture till it was late . I already had my plan , the matches , the picture of a fire like an arch inside my head . I had to spill my coal oil along the hall and into the office . I had to control things and get the heat high before anybody could see through a window that a wrong light was running , free as starlings , through the pews and up to the altar . I never knew he was still in there . They said in court he 'd stayed late to talk to some grieving lady in the basement , but that makes no sense to me . I ca n't be responsible . I lit it up . Red leaped like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the voice of the dragon roared . I gave it to her on Christmas , and when we went out , the wind caught it up . What a dance it could make , silk tips like a snake tongue fluttering , an angel wing . <p> The smart part of me ran from the first licks of fire , slipped along an alley in the back , then circled , kept low in the dark , all crouched . The smoke was white against the sky . I never like the sirens . They spoil it some . When the crowd commenced to cluster , I stole in among them , feeling blessed . That was when a man outline appeared on the porch , all trimmed in fire . He was dancing , shake and shimmy , a man-shaped flame . That 's what they mean , " all robed in holy light . " That lawyer said they had to bury him in a closed coffin . They made me carry the blame . There in the street somebody from the choir pointed me out , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Just a boy , I set my first one in a cornfield . The ears already picked . It would 've been harmless , but it caught the woods and spread faster than any dragon I had ever seen . It made my skin prickle up . It was mine . <p> Anyway , that 's why she wo n't come , the church all soot and smolder , the man turned into a crispy angel . I never meant that , but now all I 've got to talk to is shadows moving up the wall . They could be smoke . When I close my eyes and picture the first time , Conder 's woods , all those pines gone to stalks of fire , it still gets me . I like to remember back , to feel how it was hackling on my neck , the goose bumps all along my arms . I ca n't unlove the thought of torching things to beauty , but in this crazy place of cold walls and strangers who 'll spit in your food or jab you with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got me , you know , they believe they do , but I smell something sleeping under all this cement and rebar , something like the dragon . I 'm getting the itch again , and I always know where to get a match . <p> Author Affiliation
