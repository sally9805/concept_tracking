<p> Two years ago , Kim Frankwick was hunting for the college of her dreams . But unlike her friends , she decided not to use the popular US News &; World Report " America 's Best Colleges " rankings to help her choose . Instead , she used a small guidebook called " Colleges That Change Lives " - and ended up at Beloit College in Wisconsin . Today , the sophomore Russian major is happy - especially that she did n't rely on rankings . " The quality of the teaching and learning here is incredible , " she says . " I do n't know if I would have found Beloit through those rankings . " She is not alone in wondering about such things . Each fall , as some college presidents preen over their school 's hot new ranking , many others grouse that rankings based on measures such as the size of the campus library fail to answer the question at the heart of choosing any college : What are students on campus actually learning ? That concern has not slowed what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princeton Review , Yahoo ! ( the nation 's " most wired " institutions ) , Time , Newsweek , Kiplinger , and Mother Jones have all jumped into the rankings game in the past decade . Along with US News , they funnel such factors as retention rates , faculty-student ratios , and graduation rates into their own formulas to calibrate " the best . " <p> But interest is growing in alternative ways to measure an institution 's strong points . Some observers worry the " best " may really just be the biggest or richest or oldest . Lost in the rankings snapshot may be important information about the educational quality of students ' experience . Indeed , some institutions are becoming more vocal in their opposition to the traditional rankings approach . Certain colleges , like St. John 's College in Annapolis , Md. , do n't report to US News anymore - and say applications are up anyway . <p> A new approach Now arrives a new entrant that 's not a ranking at all - but could one day turn the rankings game on its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not external data points . The new National Survey of Student Engagement , released yesterday , queried 63,000 students at 276 universities and colleges last spring . The focus : how much time they spent in activities that research has shown cause students to learn . For instance , it asked seniors and freshmen on each campus how much time they spent discussing , analyzing , synthesizing . It tracked how often they collaborated with friends , and how many books they read on their own and how many they were assigned . It sought information on how many reports of 20 pages or more students had written . It asked if they had given a class presentation , and if so , how frequently ( see chart , left ) . " This is unveiling a dimension of educational quality not revealed by the usual rankings , " says Russell Edgerton , director of the Pew Forum on Undergraduate Learning , a sponsor with the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . " A lot of people think quality is measured by selectivity in admissions , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed , George Kuh , director of the NSSE at Indiana University , Bloomington , calls it a chance to peer inside " the black box . " " All colleges say they are in the business of learning , " he says . " In many cases evaluating quality is a matter of measuring time devoted to task . The more students write , the better they become at expressing themselves in the written word . " They are quick to acknowledge that because this is only the first year of the survey , it does n't yet include many top-ranked four-year institutions . But a number of prestigious schools , such as Rice University , the University of Virginia , and George Mason University , participated . NSSE hopes to greatly expand the list each year . Much research has examined learning in classrooms and disciplines . But the NSSE measures a broader swath , looking across the surveyed institutions in five areas : academic challenge , active and collaborative learning , student interaction with faculty , enriching experiences , and supportive environment . " This allows us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the college in teaching and learning , " Dr. Kuh says . " This is information that has not been publicly reported before . " <p> What students had to say Among the surprises extracted from the 276 institutions , from doctoral universities to liberal-arts colleges : * Almost a fifth ( 19 percent ) of all first-year students " never " made a class presentation . * Most first-year and senior students ( about 90 percent ) say they at least " occasionally " work harder than they thought they could to meet instructors ' standards . * Almost half ( 49 percent ) of first-year students and three-fifths ( 62 percent ) of seniors " often " or " very often " got prompt feedback from teachers . * About four-fifths ( 79 percent ) of all students say their institutions emphasize spending significant time on studying . Yet less than 15 percent of full-time freshmen and seniors spent 26 or more hours a week outside of class studying . About half ( 47 percent ) spent 6 to 15 hours a week , far less than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such contradictory findings could help institutions take action to remedy the " mismatch " between what they say they want in terms of studying and the level of performance to which they actually hold students accountable , the report says . " These students who study little are not flunking , " Kuh says . " If students can get by with this little effort , can we be satisfied with the quality of the educational experience ? This is kind of staggering . " <p> Who 's at the top ? The NSSE also revealed another point of interest : three of four best-performing institutions in the survey were small , little-known liberal-arts colleges with fewer resources than large doctoral institutions . A reader of US News &; World Report rankings of " America 's Best Colleges " would eventually find Beloit College , Elon College , Sweet Briar College , and Centre College . Centre and Beloit were ranked 42nd and 47th , respectively , among the top 50 US liberal-arts colleges . Sweet Briar was in the second tier . Elon ranked 11th among " Southern Universities . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting attention they might not otherwise receive - because they were the only schools scoring in the top 20 percent of all five of NSSE 's key categories . " It 's nice to be on the list of top schools , but it 's even better to have it based on serious research and not just reputation , " says William Flanagan , Beloit 's dean of students . " It affirms that what we think is important is being felt by students . " Little of the information parents and students use in their college research reveals factors like the amount of writing on campus , he says , or the real level of connection with faculty , or contact between students of different cultures . But while the NSSE survey does those things , it reports them by institutional group only . NSSE had to promise not to release individual school results unless permitted . <p> Asking for results Still , parents and students can find out which schools were surveyed in the report ( www.indiana.edu/ nsse/ ) and see if their prime choices are included - then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some participants would like to see NSSE results made public in some sort of ranking . " I would be thrilled if somebody took a stab at saying , this is what students say about going there , " says John Roush , president of Centre College in Danville , Ky . " There are a lot of state and other institutions claiming they 're individualized and intimate , with classes of 200 to 400 students - the truth is they 're not . " Legislators pushing for accountability may demand survey results from state schools . Experts also say the NSSE is just in the vanguard of a new wave of reports exploring college quality . Later this month , a new study will offer a 50-state report card using many measures not currently in most rankings . " There 's relentless pressure for this information , " says Patrick Callan , director of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education , which is producing the report card .
