All We Have Tuesday , 4 July 1809 Chawton , Hampshire I came into my kingdom today at half-past two -- or so much of one as shall ever be granted me on this earth . Four square brick walls , half a dozen chimneys , a simple doorway fronting on the London to Gosport road , and a clutch of outbuildings behind : such is our cottage in Chawton . " Lord , Jane , " my mother breathed as she surveyed the unadorned facade of her future abode from the vantage of our hired pony trap , " I should not call it charming , to be sure -- but beggars can not be choosers , you know , and we must admit ourselves infinitely obliged to your excellent brother . Observe , a new cesspit has been dug , and the privy painted ! I declare , is nothing forgot that might contribute to our comfort ? " I did not reply , for tho ' the raw mud near the new plumbing works looked dismal enough , my mother could not hesitate to approve the generosity Edward has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heir of our distant cousins the Knights , my brother chuses to reside at his principal estate of Godmersham , in Kent -- but has given us the use of his late bailiff 's cottage here in Hampshire . If a former alehouse , fronting the juncture of two highways overrun by coaching traffic , with rough-hewn beams , low-ceilinged rooms , and cramped stairs , may be considered a luxury , then we are bound to be grateful to Edward ; he has saved four women the expence of lodgings , and for a household of strict economy and perpetual dependence , that cost must be a saving indeed . There are some among our acquaintance who would hint that , in possessing the freehold of every house in Chawton village , my brothermight have done more for his widowed mother , and done it years since ; but I will not join my strictures to theirs.1 My heart rises to smell the good earth again , and rejoices to think that my mornings will never more be shattered by the bustle of a town , and all the noise of commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one is broken-hearted , like the healing balm of the country ! " I shall plant potatoes , " my mother declared briskly , " and if we are fortunate , we shall gather them by late September . The cottage 's aspect might be softened , Jane . It requires only a flowering vine , I think , to grow romantickly across the door . " "  - -  And to complete the picturesque , it ought to be sagging in its casements . It is too much to hope for a shattered roof or a tower crumbling into ruin ; we must contrive to be satisfied with a building that is only ample , sturdy , and in good repair , Mamma . " The house 's position at the fork of Chawton 's two principal roads must be adjudged an evil -- but outweighing this are the broad meadows to north and east , the stout wood fence and hornbeam hedge enclosing the grounds , and the delightful promise of birdsong from the thriving fields . Mr. Seward , the late bailiff , maintained a shrubbery and an orchard , but Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must and shall be worked . Syringas , and peonies , and the simpler blooms of mignonette -- all these we shall have , and Sweet William too . While the carter jumped down to secure his horse , I studied the distant view of the privy and banished the idea of a water closet , soon to be installed in brother Henry 's London house ; such ostentation has no place in a country village . It is not for Jane to repine . I had found no love or joy in the habitation of cities -- I had rather witnessed , in first Bath and then Southampton , the gradual erosion of nearly every cherished dream I held in life . It was time I made a trial of rural delights ; it was they that had formed my earliest vision of happiness . " The man will want something for his pains , " my mother urged in an audible hiss as the driver helped her to descend . " See that he shifts the baggage before he deserts us entirely . And do not go spoiling him with Edward 's coin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She moved with determination in the direction of my brother 's improvements , her gait marked by the stiffness of rheumatism . I stepped down to the rutted surface of the road and prepared to be -- if not happy , then content . We had set out from Castle Square in late April , bidding farewell forever to the glare and stink of a town . We made for Godmersham , where we tarried six weeks in the pleasant Kentish spring , tho ' the place and all who live in it are remarkably changed from what they once were . My brother Edward 's wife Elizabeth is dead now nearly a year and my sister Cassandra resident in the household , supplying the want of a mother ; she is careworn but steady in her attachment to the little children , and a prop to Fanny , who at sixteen must now fill Elizabeth 's place . Tho ' the chuckling of the Stour was as sweet as I remembered , and the temple on the hill beckoned with serenity , I could not stomach the climb to its heights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times I had sat in that very place with Elizabeth beside me -- and once , looked up from my pen to find the tall figure of a silver-haired man climbing the grassy slope -- Edward has not yet learned to endure his Lizzy 's passing . Indeed , he has come to see in it a deliberate blow of Divine Judgement : that having loved his wife too well , and delighting in the gift of every luxury and indulgence her fair form desired , he incurred the wrath of Providence -- Who despised Edward 's attachment to things of this world so much , that He tore from my brother 's bosom the one creature he cherished most . " Were it not for the children , " Neddie observed bitterly as we sat together before the bare grate in the stillness of Elizabeth 's drawing-room , " I should have gone into the grave with her , Jane . I should not have hesitated at self-murder. " "  - -  Tho ' the very act should damn you to Hell ? " " It is Hell I endure at present . " I could not assure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not add my misery to his own , as he sat glaring at the waste of all that constituted his happiness . Edward knew nothing of the Gentleman Rogue , beyond a passing acquaintance with one who had called briefly at Godmersham several years before , and had long since been forgot . I could not explain that I , too , must submit to all the agony of bereavement -- with the added burden of suffering in silence . Never having been Lord Harold Trowbridge 's acknowledged love , I must be mute in misery before the world he deserted so abruptly last November . As I studied my brother 's countenance -- grave , where it had once been gay ; worn , where it had formerly appeared the portrait of inveterate youth -- I concluded that there was at least this relief in public grief : one was not forced to shield the feelings of others . The Bereaved might be all that is selfish in their parade of unhappiness . Whereas I was continually chafing under the daily proofs of inconsideration , imperviousness , high animal spirits , and insensibility that surrounded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at an end . When the Rogue expired of a knife wound on the fifth of November , some ten months ago , it was as though a black pit yawned at my feet and I trembled on the brink of it for days together without being conscious of what I said or did . I know from others that his body was fetched back to London in the Duke of Wilborough 's carriage ; that Wilborough House , so lately draped in black for the passing of the Rogue 's mother , remained in crepe for this second son ; that nearly five hundred men followed the cortege first to the Abbey church at Westminster and then , on horseback , to the interment in the Wilborough tomb . It was said that no less than seven ladies of Fashion fainted dead away at the awful news of his demise , and three fell into a decline . All this my mother read aloud from the London papers , offering comment and opinion of her own . Murdered by his manservant , so they say , Jane , a foreigner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll wager that fellow knew a thing or two of Lord Harold 's unsavoury affairs ! It is a nasty end , Jane , but no more than he deserved . I always said he was a most unsuitable tendre for a young lady such as yourself , and quite elderly into the bargain ; but nobody listens to me , I am always overruled . Still , it is a pity you did not get him when you could -- you might have been the Relict of a lord ! And now all his riches will go to Wilborough 's son -- who will find no very good use for them , I 'll wager . The Marquis is a rakehell and a gamester , so they say . Kinsfell has taken a page from his uncle 's book , and will undoubtedly prove as disreputable a character . We must impute it to the Dowager Duchess 's French blood , and habits of parading onstage . . . . Four days after the murder I took up my pen to compose a few paragraphs of explanation and regret that ought to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Countess of Swithin . That lady , despite her lofty position in Society and the cares attendant upon her duties as a mother , has been narrowly concerned -- as much as a woman could be -- in Lord Harold 's affairs , and loved him more dearly , I suspect , than she did her own father . It seemed imperative to me that the Countess be in full possession of the facts of his lordship 's death -- of the bravery with which he embraced it , and his determination not to submit to a form of treachery that might imperil His Majesty 's government -- so that no scandalous falsehood put about by his enemies among the ton should shake her faith in his worth . From what I knew of Desdemona , I doubted that anything could . Her answer was brief , correct , and exceedingly cold . I knew not whether she regarded my letter of commiseration in the light of an impertinence ; or whether she charged me with having precipitated her uncle 's death . Perhaps she merely judged his attentions to a woman so clearly beneath his touch as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's brevity cut me to the quick . I have had nothing from her since . Only Martha Lloyd , who in Cassandra 's absence has become as dear as a sister to me , understood a little of the pain I suffered . Tho ' Martha referred to my grief as a chronic indisposition , she was quick to order me to bed , and leave me in silence with a pot of tea during the long grey winter afternoons . My brother Frank , who had witnessed the Rogue 's death in company with myself , was a considerable comfort . Tho ' he no longer shared our lodgings , his occasional visits afforded the opportunity to unbend -- to speak openly of what we both knew and mourned in his lordship 's passing . Even in Frank 's silence I felt sympathy , and in his accounts of his naval activities -- he oversaw the landing in January of the remnant of General Sir John Moore 's Peninsular army , a tattered band of harried soldiers deprived too soon of the leadership of that excellent man -- I felt some connexion to the greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forced to go on living , however little we relish the interminable days . In April , Frank quitted home waters for the China Station and we devoted ourselves to the activity of household removal . My mother 's querulous demands and persistent anxieties regarding the packing provided diversion enough ; so , too , did the necessary farewells to naval acquaintance , the last visits to the little theatre in French Street , and a final Assembly endured at the Dolphin Inn . I even danced on that occasion with a black-eyed foreign gentleman too shy to enquire my name . But I had no joy in any of these things . The coming of spring mocked me with a promise of life I no longer shared . At the moment of our descent upon Edward 's house in Kent , I had determined I should never feel hopeful again . There is no remedy for the loss inflicted by death except remembrance . And so I tried to recollect what his lordship 's dying words had been . Promise me . . . you will write . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All we have . . . Jane . He was wont to speak the truth , no matter how harsh its effect . It was one of the qualities for which I esteemed him : his unblinking gaze at the brutality of existence . But I could not keep my promise . What are words and paragraphs in comparison of what might have been ? A cold solace when love is forever denied . I had written nothing in the long months that followed Lord Harold 's headlong flight from this world but stilted letters to Cassandra , remarkable for their brittleness of tone and the forced lightness of their jokes . Before quitting Castle Square , however , I had gone so far as to enquire of Messrs . Crosby and Co. , of Stationers Hall Court , London , whether they ever intended to publish the manuscript entitled Susan , which I had sold to them for the sum of ten pounds six years previous ; but their answer was not encouraging . I was impudently informed by Mr. Crosby himself that he did not chuse to publish my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he should most vigourously prevent its appearance ; and in conclusion , that I might have the manuscript returned for the same figure he had laid out for it . Being hard pressed to command so considerable a sum as ten pounds , I was forced to let the matter drop ; and was dissatisfied enough with the scant consideration offered prospective Authoresses , as to ignore the burden of Lord Harold 's dying breath . Now , as I stood in the dusky heat of a Hampshire July , lark song rising about me , I felt the first faint stirrings of life . Feeble , yes -- and a hairsbreadth from guttering out ; but stirrings all the same . I unknotted my bonnet strings and bared my head to the sun . Lord Harold 's gaze -- that earnest , steadfast look -- wavered before my mind 's eye ; I blinked it away . Perhaps here , I thought , as I opened the door of the cottage and stepped inside its whitewashed walls , perhaps here I might begin again . Chapter 2 An Indifferent Welcome 4 July 1809 , cont @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as though the windows had been too long shut up , and I recollected that although the workmen had been busy about the house some weeks , Mrs. Seward had quitted the place full four months previous . I hesitated in the entry hall , my gaze taking in the uneven floorboards , and was reminded inevitably of my childhood home at Steventon Parsonage , where my brother James now lived . Just so had the spare rooms been whitewashed , the low ceilings crossed with beams .
