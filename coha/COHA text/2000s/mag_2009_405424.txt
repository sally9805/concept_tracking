IN THE WAKE OF A SCANDAL LINKING HER HUSBAND TO ANOTHER WOMAN , KATE GOSSELIN OF THE HIT TV SHOW JON &; KATE PLUS 8 TALKS ABOUT THE RUMORS , THE REALITY AND WHAT THIS MEANS FOR HER FAMILY 'S FUTURE . This is not the Mother 's Day weekend Kate Gosselin had planned . Rather than celebrating with her brood of eight children , she sits in a Manhattan hotel suite , sipping a cup of coffee and holding a tissue in her hand . " It 's hell , " she says of her life the past few weeks , twisting the tissue until it begins to shred into pieces . Her world , too , has seemed on the verge of disintegrating . Best known as the hyper-efficient matriarch on the hit TLC reality show Jon &; Kate Plus 8 , Kate and her husband , Jon , are raising twin girls ( Cara and Mady , 8 ) and sextuplets ( Alexis , Aaden , Collin , Leah , Hannah and Joel , 5 ) while cameras record every tantrum and time-out . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves : On April 19 , when Kate was out of town promoting her latest book , paparazzi snapped her husband leaving a local bar at 2 a.m. with a 23-year-old woman , Deanna Hummel , whose brother later claimed she 'd been having a months-long affair with Jon . Subsequent photos showed Hummel sunbathing , with others , at the Gosselins ' 24-acre spread in Wernersville , Pa . Though both Hummel and Jon vehemently denied any infidelity ( see sidebar ) , Jon did acknowledge that his nights out while his wife was away were the result of " poor decisions and bad judgments " and said he was " sorry for putting my family in this awkward position . " That apology might be too little , too late . The couple are now at a point where they will not even be interviewed together , and Kate says she and her husband have been privately struggling for months . " I do n't know that we 're in the same place anymore , that we want the same thing , " she says quietly . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this person ? ' for a while . I remember where I was the first time I heard her name . It 's one of those things where you can try to make it go away , but there 's blaring , red flashing lights . " It 's a long way from the relatively simple life Jon and Kate used to lead , when their biggest problems were simply making ends meet for the massive family . Married when Kate was 24 and Jon just 22 , they found sudden fame after a documentary about their life with multiple babies became an instant hit . Now over 4 million viewers tune in to their show ( season 5 begins May 25 ) . Though Kate , 34 , previously worked as a nurse and Jon , 32 , was a network engineer , they now devote their time exclusively to the show , which films year-round in their home . " We do n't have a backup plan anymore , " says Kate . " We 're caught , because this is our job . " That job is lucrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't divulge specific amounts , but estimates range from $25,000 to $50,000 per episode ) , thousands more have been earned through DVDs , and the family receives perks such as free trips and products . Kate also regularly travels for paid speaking engagements and has authored two books about life with multiples . Yet it 's just this success , Kate says now , that has driven a wedge into her marriage . " I have always made more money than Jon , " she explains . " That does n't bother me at all ; it all goes into the same pot . But it obviously , at this point , really matters to him . He hates to speak , he does n't write , he does n't do public appearances -- all those things I love . And now he 's resenting me for it . My point is I could care less if this all died tomorrow , for my sake . It 's for my kids . I feel if we put ourselves out there , it 's got to be worth it , for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just on different pages , we 're in different books . But now I think we 're in different libraries . " That Kate and Jon disagree is no surprise to fans of their show , in which Kate is often shown nagging , berating or snapping at Jon for failing to perform one task or another . But for all the times she 's been shown as abrasive , Kate says she 'd been doing her best to support her husband as he grew disenchanted with their increasingly high-profile life . " I 've walked through this with him for six months , " she says . " First he said he 's unhappy , he needs a career . ' Great , ' I said . ' Go get a part-time job . Volunteer at the girls ' school , at our church , do whatever you want . ' Never happened . So I said , ' Go back to school ! You wanted to finish your degree ? Now is the time ! ' Yeah , that never happened . Originally , we 'd speak together on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't like to speak , you do most of the speaking anyway , why do n't you just go ? ' So I started carving him off engagements so he could stay home with the kids . That worked well , for a while . But then it was , ' Well , I need help . ' Okay , we found a lovely girl and she started helping . And then it was , ' I ca n't live in this neighborhood anymore . ' So right around that time , we moved . Every complaint he 's had I 've tried to fix . But the bottom line is , choose happiness or do n't . Nobody can make you happy except yourself . And I do n't really feel he is happy . " Of course the one option that has n't been tried is walking away from the show . " Everybody says , ' Oh , quit and go away , ' " Kate says . " But I 'm hesitant to do that , because I do n't think that 'll make Jon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs of my kids . I have a huge weight on my shoulders . This needs to go on because I need to be able to provide for my kids . " Especially since she feels she may soon have to do it on her own . " Possibly , " she says . " I 'm not going to rule it out , I 'm not going to rule it in . All I know is I need to be set to do it . " For a woman who has referred to her husband as " my balance , my strength and my stability , " to now consider a future apart has been heartbreaking but not impossible . " You ca n't imagine yourself in a certain position when all this first happens , but you can do it over some months , " she says . " It 's a lot like when I was first pregnant with the babies , and it was pure shock and denial . But over time I imagined six cribs in my house , and six car seats . When your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any number of scenarios . " Including the possibility that , despite his denials , her husband 's actions may not have been entirely innocent . Asked if she believes her husband 's claim that he did not cheat , Kate falters for a moment and looks away for a long time . Finally , peering through her shock of blonde hair , she says carefully , " I do n't think I know if I believe him . I do n't think that I know the whole truth , and to be very honest , I do n't know that I ever will . My gut instinct says he 's mad that he got caught . There was n't a whole lot of thought that went into all that behavior . " Jon has explained that his partying was due , in part , to the long days he spends as a stay-at-home dad while Kate travels . But Kate is quick to point out that even when she 's not at home , she 's in constant contact with her children . " I 've been doing major emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the spare time I have , I am talking to my kids on the phone . They 're all pretty oblivious to what 's been going on . Which is a huge blessing . They attend a school where nobody really cares about the tabloids , so I do n't feel like any of this is going to impact them ... not yet , anyway . " But she has spent far less time talking to Jon , whose name she rarely even utters . " I have to do it carefully , " she says of any discussions . " He has a lot of anger . I have a lot of anger too , and sadness . But I have to keep it in check , for the sake of our kids . " Kate , a self-professed " control freak , " must now cope with a life that is thoroughly out of control . " I was powerless to stop this , " she says of her husband 's descent into behavior better suited to a fraternity pledge once she left town . " I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doing ? Where are you going ? I do n't understand . ' But I 'm not there ; I do n't have a say . Do I prefer that he was feeding them pizza instead of the organic meals I prepared in advance ? No . Do I prefer that these people I do not know are at my house ? No . It 's a huge disappointment to me . I 'm really suffering . He 's made bad choices . Things that I would never ever choose for the father of my children to do . Going out late , being in bars with women until 2 in the morning , buying a car without even talking to me about it . " Given that Kate notoriously lost her cool in one episode when Jon failed to use a coupon , one can only imagine the havoc wreaked by splurging on an automobile . But Kate noticeably bristles at any suggestion that her tightly wound temperament somehow drove Jon to act out . " Oh , it 's still my fault , for heaven 's sake , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's like , ' No wonder ! Look at her ! ' and they show the most horrendous clip . But everyone is responsible for their own actions , no matter what . I did not cause this . It 's ridiculous , really , it 's pathetic . Are you kidding me ? I drove him to that ? Please . I 'm not going to say I 'm perfect . My horrible moments , I 'm not proud of those . But even so , I should not be blamed for the decisions that he 's made . " Those decisions are what she continues to struggle with as she contemplates what lies ahead . " I 've screamed out loud . I 've wanted to strangle him , " she says . " What makes me the most angry is that all of these choices he made , they 're going to affect our children 's future . I do n't want them to look back and see him as this person . I just feel like he 's a different person , like he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he changed his focus . I do n't know why , " she says , her voice tinged with sadness . " Because my focus has n't changed . " But the show must go on , and when Kate returned home for the sextuplets ' birthday , taping for the new season continued . She is resigned to the fact that some of her family 's struggle will be televised . " I do n't know how this will play out , " she says . " We 'll show what we think will be safe for the kids to see 5 or 10 years from now . Every second of every day will not be filmed . Never has been . We do need our privacy . " Especially since public scrutiny of their relationship is likely only to intensify . Tabloids have recently begun questioning whether Kate has a romantic relationship with Steve Neild , a bodyguard who frequently travels with her . " Already the allegations they 're making about me are disgusting , unthinkable , unfathomable , and I am horrified , " she says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worked this hard to take myself down . " And she 's not done fighting for her family . " We do n't know where anything is going right now , " she says . " There is hope . I will never stop hoping that every member of our family can be absolutely happy again . Every day I have moments where I cry and I say , ' It 's too much , I do n't want to go on . ' And then I think , ' Well , you have two choices . Your choices are laying on the floor or moving forward for the sake of your kids , your marriage , for everything you believe in . ' And so I pull myself together and I keep going . " PULLQUOTE " I DO N'T THINK THAT I KNOW THE WHOLE TRUTH , AND TO BE VERY HONEST , I DO N'T KNOW THAT I EVER WILL " " IT 'S A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT TO ME . HE 'S MADE BAD CHOICES . THINGS I WOULD NEVER , EVER CHOOSE FOR THE FATHER OF MY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BOARD The sextuplets were born at nearly 30 weeks and in good health . HARD WORK " I 've fought through a pregnancy where every minute was a battle , " says Kate ( of the sextuplets ) . " I will not fail my kids . " WEDDING DAY The couple married on June 12 , 1999 HOME SWEET HOME Much of the show was filmed in a smaller house , but " People were taking pictures on our porch , watching our kids play , " says Kate . The family recently moved to this far-larger farmhouse . FAMILY FIELD TRIP The whole gang often travel together with cameras in tow . " It 's small sacrifices now for huge payoffs later , " Kate says of their hectic schedule . SIDEBAR WHAT JON SAYS Jon Gosselin wanted to leave home this weekend , and then he remembered he 's a reality show star , paparazzi target and a married man suspected of infidelity . " I just wanted to take my car out , listen to music and calm down , " he says . " But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look ? " Things have n't been looking great for Jon ever since reports about him stepping out on his wife began to surface in February . Jon denies cheating on Kate but admits , " I 've been hanging out and partying with friends , perhaps a bit too much . But that 's all it ever was . " According to Jon , he was poorly prepared for all the attention that comes from fame . " In the beginning I was having fun , " he says . " It 's really becoming work now . " And the stay-at-home dad would just like a break from his job once in a while . " I 'm Jon Gosselin , not Jon &; Kate Plus 8 , " he says . " I got married at 22 , had twins at 23 and the sextuplets at 27 . I would n't have it any other way but I never went out in my 20s . " Now it seems he might not be getting out much in his 30s either . " I 'm not going to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be extra careful about how I spend my time in public . " That change upsets the self-described " extreme extrovert , " but Gosselin knows his priorities : " I will do anything to protect my family . "
