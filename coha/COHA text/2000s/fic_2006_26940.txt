The Free Stuff Room My name is A.J. and I hate school . There 's only one room in Ella Mentry School that I really like . It 's the lost and found room ! The lost and found room is right near the office . It is the coolest room in the history of the world because there is lots of free stuff in there . Me and my friends Michael and Ryan call it " the free stuff room . " You can get just about anything you want , and you do n't even have to pay for it . So if I feel like getting a new baseball cap or a pair of sunglasses , I do n't have to go to a store . I just go to the free stuff room at school . It 's awesome ! So this one morning the bus got to school a little early , and I went to kill some time in the free stuff room . I saw a really cool black T-shirt with a lightning bolt across the back . It was way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my shirt off and put the cool one on . It fit perfectly . I stuffed my old , boring shirt in my backpack . It was almost time to pledge the allegiance , so I went to class . The kids were putting their backpacks and lunch boxes in their cubbies . Our teacher , Miss Daisy , was n't there yet . That was weird . She usually gets to school before any of us . " Where 's Miss Daisy ? " asked Neil , who everybody calls " the nude kid . " He actually wears clothes , but we call him " the nude kid " anyway . It 's a long story . " Maybe she got lost , " Michael said . Suddenly the door opened . We all looked up . But it was n't Miss Daisy . It was Andrea Young , this really annoying little Miss Perfect girl with curly brown hair who I hate . She 's such a nerd . She even keeps a dictionary on her desk in case she ever has to look up a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her equally annoying crybaby friend , Emily . " I was worried that you were sick . There 's something going around , you know . " " I was n't sick , " Andrea said . " I had to go to Mr. Klutz 's office . " " Oooooh ! " we all went . Mr. Klutz is the principal of the school . He also has no hair . Kids get sent to his office when they do something bad . " Did you do something bad ? " asked Emily , all concerned . " Of course not ! " Andrea said . " Mr. Klutz called me in to say I 'm going to be in the gifted and talented program ! " Oh man ! That figured . The gifted and talented program is for dorks , dweebs , nerds , and know-it-alls like Andrea who are perfect in every way . We all took some dumb test a few weeks ago , and Andrea probably got the best score in the whole school . " Is n't that fabulous ? " Andrea said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's your talent ? " I asked her . " Being annoying ? " Some of the kids laughed . Andrea gave me one of her mean looks . " I like your shirt , Arlo , " she said . " Where did you get it ? " " None of your beeswax , " I told her . I hate when Andrea calls me by my real name . " Oh yeah ? " she said . " Well , I think it is my beeswax , because that 's my shirt ! " What ? ! " That shirt fell out of my backpack last week , " Andrea said . " I was wondering where it was . " Everybody started giggling . I thought I was gon na die . I was wearing a girl 's shirt ! Not only was I wearing a girl 's shirt , but it was Andrea 's shirt ! Her girl cooties were crawling all over me ! It was disgusting . I thought I was gon na throw up . " Oooooh ! " Ryan said . " A.J. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love ! " " When are you gon na get married ? " asked Michael . If those guys were n't my best friends , I would hate them . Continues ...
