<p> COMBAT ROCK <p> Julien Temple 's new documentary explores the life of the Clash 's Joe Strummer . <p> - - - <p> In addition to serving as a moving portrait of an extraordinary human being and an impressive account of his accomplishments on album and onstage , " Joe Strummer : The Future Is Unwritten , " Julien Temple 's new documentary about the leader of the Clash , stands as one of the most fascinating films ever made about the struggle between art and commerce in the world of rock ' n ' roll . <p> Proclaiming themselves " the only band that matters , " the members of the Clash were as notable for their idealism , humanism and heartfelt political convictions as their peers in the Sex Pistols were famous for their sneering anger and deep-seated cynicism . And Temple , who came of age in London during the same explosive period that gave birth to punk rock , has now made the definitive movies about both groups . ( His Sex Pistols film , " The Filth and the Fury , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the much-loved 1986 feature , " Absolute Beginners . " ) <p> " I actually ca n't see the Sex Pistols and the Clash as black and white , " Temple says . " They overlap , and the Clash came out of the Pistols  --  it 's like Adam giving Eve the rib or whatever . There are a lot of positive things about the Pistols and a lot of negative things about the Clash , although everyone says the Pistols were just negative and the Clash were just positive . I do n't see it like that at all . I think the Clash were show business , but I think show business is a subversive art form if you so desire it to be  --  or at least an oppositional , educational outlet as well as entertainment . " <p> If the Clash had one of the most impressive early careers in rock history , the way they petered out was just dramatic and memorable in a truly awful way . The unflattering , shorthand take holds that the optimistic idealism of the band 's early tours and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1977 ) and the phenomenal double album " London Calling " ( 1979 )  --  were replaced by a much more hollow and conventional kind of rock stardom and lust for " filthy lucre " ; witness the 1982 single " Rock the Casbah " ( Strummer was later horrified to learn that American pilots painted that title on the bombs they dropped on Baghdad ) or the sad final album , " Cut the Crap " ( 1985 ) , by which point Strummer had unceremoniously booted his former mate Mick Jones from the band . <p> " I knew the Clash before they signed their first deal , and you could tell the struggle with ' selling out ' was there even then : The allure of that orange CBS label was very powerful right from the beginning , " Temple says . " I 'm also doing a film now about Christopher Marlowe , who was the guy who wrote about that Faustian pact , based on his own experience of selling out to an extent . Marlowe invented the theater that Shakespeare took on , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' or whatever you want to call them . It 's interesting that Marlowe is the first figure in English history of this kind , and right at the beginning he wrote the Faustus story , which is about selling his soul . <p> " I think Joe was freaked out at a certain point by realizing that he 'd lost every thing he 'd set out to do with the Clash by becoming so distanced from the audience physically in these stadiums . It was a very depressing thing for him . ... But he was n't just the sort of guy who could admit his mistakes ; he 'd turn them over and over in his mind and try to learn from them and try to make sure he did n't do them again . He actually went through the flaws and the contradictions in himself as a kind of creative motor  --  he did n't sweep them away and pretend they did n't exist ; he tried to use them . Most rock stars try to pretend they 're perfect , and once they have too many guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of believe it . " <p> " The Future Is Unwritten " does n't flinch from examining where Strummer went wrong and began to believe his own mythology . But it also ends on a high note  --  with Strummer returning to his hippie/communal roots and reconnecting with his muse via the new band the Mescaleros after a long self-imposed exile from the music scene  --  at least until his untimely and unexpected death in December 2002 , the result of a congenital heart defect that had long gone undiagnosed . <p> " It 's a film about a friend as much as anything else , or a film about friendship , " Temple says . " Rather than seeing it as a kind of rockumentary  --  and I just hate the very concept of that  --  the emotional , narrative drive was a crucial thing for me to try to access , and to get away from this kind of music-documentary ghetto . " <p> Temple certainly succeeded in this goal , in part because the movie 's subject , who was born John Mellor , the son of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; there 's a memorable scene where a Japanese fan just ca n't stop hugging Strummer , and she does n't even seem to know why . The film is also helped by the fact that the director came up with the perfect device for framing the many interviews with rock luminaries , friends and relatives : Toward the end of his life , Strummer , who idolized Woody Guthrie , was fond of holding court with friends and fellow musicians around a big bonfire , and Temple conducted almost all of his interviews in the same setting . <p> " That came about for various reasons . The fundamental thing was that it was a big part of Joe 's last few years ; it was a very important thing for him , and I spent many hours with him around a campfire . ... Another reason is that when people are interviewed , they tend to clam up and not say what they really feel because they 're so self-conscious . Around a fire , you 've got the camera hidden behind the flames in the darkness , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversational exchange with the interviewer . So that was all good , and then the last thing is that I thought that people are going to get annoyed or confused if I open the film with a lot of people talking about this punk-rock warlord while sitting around a campfire , which is sort of a hippie thing to do . It was a good kind of punk connection with the audience , to start them off thinking , ' What the hell is going on here ? ' " <p> After completing his film on Marlowe and another project about Australian opera , Temple says he has one more great rock story he 'd like to film : the tale of the Kinks , focusing on those famous battling brothers , Ray and Dave Davies . <p> " That one will have a bit of ' Rashomon ' to it , " Temple says , " because every event has two very different perspectives .
