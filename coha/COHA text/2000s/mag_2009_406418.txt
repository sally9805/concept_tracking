To be philanthropic in these times is to find  --  and spread  --  happiness . WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN , my parents wisely told me : Money comes , and money goes . The key is to be prepared to take care of yourself and those you love and to be in the service of creating a better world . Above all , count your blessings , invest your money , name and educate your successors , and prepare for a lifetime of change and transitions . Everyone has been touched by the current financial crisis , which demands exactly the lessons imparted by my parents . We have watched our peers and relatives lose jobs , reputations , life savings and homes . Meanwhile , nonprofits that we love and support require more leadership and money than we have available . It 's humbling , but this decline presents an opportunity for a better future . As an inheritor who was guided by engaged parents , I saw firsthand the keys to success in transferring wealth : discuss family values and expectations , practice a philanthropy that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will assume responsibility as it is passed from one generation to the next . For thirty years I 've been advising my peers about philanthropy and the intergenerational shift of leadership and wealth through my book , Inspired Philanthropy , and as a guest lecturer ; lately , though , I 've heard stories that are revealing of our hard times . " In a world that taught us not to show our cards or talk about money as we built our fortunes , I did n't know which fire to try to put out first , " said a sixty-two-year-old female antiques collector and philanthropist from Atlanta . " Within weeks , two of my kids lost their jobs . Due to a slashed income , another would have to give up the new apartment into which his growing family had just moved . We were not sure our mother 's investments would carry her into her final years . We 'd invested significantly in hedge funds and retired early , and we had multiyear , million-dollar pledges I knew we could not deliver on . I had never imagined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifetime earning . " That is just one tale in which the prevailing fear is that the unraveling will continue . When I spoke to Marian Moore , a social-venture-capital adviser in Minneapolis , she was devising an antidote to such worries . " Because I knew my kids would be hearing about the economic downturn , I decided to talk to them about money to give context to the climate of fear and contraction , " said Moore , whose late father was Paul Moore Jr. , an Episcopal bishop and the leading liberal Christian voice for a decade in New York City . " The kids are twenty , seventeen and thirteen . I treated them as I would a board of directors . I told them how much money I had inherited and how I had changed over the years from someone living off inherited investments to someone who learned how to earn money . I shared the level of my assets and what they stand to inherit . And I told them what I think is of most value during these times : community and caring for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal relationship to it , the more able we will be to identify what is important in our lives . This is what I call the upside of the downside . " Family-foundation leaders are also challenged . Lisa Parker is an adviser to families as well as president of the Lawrence Welk Family Foundation ( see page 125 ) , in Santa Monica , California , established by her grandfather the late television bandleader . " The paradox is that in economic times like these , the opportunities for our humanity to flourish are abundant , " she stresses . " Philanthropy , literally translated , is ' the love of humankind . ' Our foundation 's assets have declined steeply . Our instinct is to hold on to what we have . As philanthropists , we must ask ourselves , ' Does the integrity of our portfolio trump our commitment to the individuals served ? ' I would say , give boldly . This is our opportunity for heroism , and it will make more of an impact now than ever before . " Parker adds : " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neighbors losing their homes . Just a few hours spent as a family , volunteering at a community center , made us feel , dare I say it , joyful . Yes , feeling valued and helpful is joyful . The great challenge for many of us who are working and parenting and juggling is how to incorporate these opportunities and discussions into the day to day . Fortunately , there are good resources out there , among them the Acme Sharing Company acmesharing.com and YouthGive youthgive.org . " In difficult times , there are those who step forward to lead . The assets of the Bill &; Melinda Gates Foundation were down by more than 20 percent last year , and yet the Gateses decided to increase their giving of trust assets from 5 percent to 7 percent . In his annual letter , Gates said that he would not back off from his commitments . Phil Cubeta , who occupies the Sallie B. and William B. Wallace Chair of Philanthropy at the American College , in Bryn Mawr , Pennsylvania , says : " How much a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partly a matter of its philosophy of what a good life is and partly one of calculating how much is needed to sustain a given lifestyle . With thoughtful priority setting and good financial , tax and legal counsel , a family can do great things as a leader . Passing on that kind of legacy can be the greatest inheritance of all . " Self-proclaimed " thrillionaire " Ruth Ann Harnisch , of the Harnisch Foundation , based in New York City , says : " If you are blessed enough to have surplus , be as generous as you can . Some of my best investments of the past decade were in philanthropic venture capital that paid off in improved lives and conditions . I know that investing in philanthropy was more rewarding in many ways than investing elsewhere . It 's up to us to define the ' new normal , ' and sometimes the young inheritors , such as those in the Resource Generation network resourcegeneration.org , are ahead of their elders in defining resourcefulness more broadly . It 's time for families to tap the wealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " HELPING OUT IN HARD TIMES * Begin with what you want to change or preserve . Do the organizations to which you 've been giving match your values ? * Consider what local agencies might now require for support . * Assign percentages to different categories of your giving budget . * Call agencies early in the year if you have been a sustaining donor or volunteer and will be reducing your gifts or engagement . * Recruit friends to join you in giving . * Meet with your financial advisers to see if you can make a legacy gift , or consider a charitable trust . * Call those leaders and organizations that you respect and count on to build a better world , and unleash your resourcefulness . Three ways to say no ( nicely ) to requests to donate if you have n't got the goods to give : * " We are focusing our giving more narrowly this year and have chosen other priority areas . We regret not being able to support your worthy cause and impressive leadership . " * " I love your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be attending your event , perhaps over lunch I could help you think of others to invite who might help you . " * " We have half as much to work with this year , but we care twice as much . What if I join the development committee and propose other prospective donors who might meet our giving level of the past ? "
