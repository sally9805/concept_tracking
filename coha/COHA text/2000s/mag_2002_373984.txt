A lot has been made of George Bush 's victory last week . But while controlling the White House and both houses of Congress is impressive , there was an additional triumph to savor : driving a stake through the Clinton era . Although he was n't running , Bill Clinton was a major presence , raising funds , campaigning for candidates and generally trying to help his party regain its mojo . Tuesday 's vote was a repudiation of his efforts . What 's more , last week 's rout may well quiet critics who continue to suggest that with help from his brother and the Supreme Court , Bush had stolen the 2000 election from Al Gore . This is Bush Country now . <P> Clinton compounded his problems at the infamous memorial service for Minnesota Senator Paul Wellstone . There he was , his face blown up on the Jumbotron , cheering and swaying as if he were at Woodstock IV , showing no disapproval then or later over the booing of Republican Senator Trent Lott , who had come to pay his respects . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offense and , with impunity , order flags flying at half-mast to be raised early , you know it was unsavory . Here 's how Congressman Tom Davis , chairman of the Republican Congressional Committee , summed it up : " Nothing gets Republican voters more hyped up than seeing President Clinton on the tube ... it got our base ginned up . " <P> Coattails ? Not on Bill . During the primaries , association with Clinton proved toxic . Three of his former Cabinet members lost . His intervention to help shore up black support for his wife in the New York State primary by getting his former Cabinet Secretary , Andrew Cuomo , out of the race led to one of the most impressive losses of the election . Comptroller Carl McCall lost to Governor George Pataki by 16 percentage points . In North Carolina , former Clinton chief of staff Erskine Bowles would n't even let the former Chief Executive visit . Where Clinton did go , candidates like Maryland 's Kathleen Kennedy Townsend and Massachusetts ' Shannon O'Brien lost . In Florida , where Clinton went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance of Governor Jeb Bush , the ex-President failed decisively to get out the vote . Turnout actually dropped 17% from 1994 , the last Democratic gubernatorial win . <P> Clinton was n't , of course , the primary reason the Democrats lost , but there 's no reason to think he would accept responsibility if he were . At a postelection dinner in his Harlem office , Clinton , his voice hoarse after three red-eye flights , said only that you ca n't beat a party with a message with a party without one , ignoring the fact that he is the master of blurring the differences , of shaking down the same wealthy donors as the opposition in exchange for a similar nonthreatening agenda .
