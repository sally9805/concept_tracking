Just because they really are out to get you does n't mean you are n't paranoid . If they 've been after you long enough , paranoia can become a reflex . Interesting things , reflexes : if you pay attention to them , you 'll stand to learn some interesting things about yourself . This is one reason I avoid paying attention to my reflexes . But sometimes I ca n't help it . Let me pick an example at random : I awoke almost instantly from a sound sleep to active stillness , and before reaching for a weapon , or dodging from a possible attack , or even opening my eyes , I reached out , mentally , psychically , for contact with my familiar . My mind to his , I said , " What 's going on , Loiosh ? " At that instant , all I knew was that something had happened to wake me up . I did n't even remember where I was , though one patch of ground in the wilderness is much like another , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clue that there might be a problem came when he did n't make any wisecracks . Instead there was moment of mental silence , if you 'll excuse the expression , and then Loiosh said , " We may have been hunted down , Boss . " " Well , " I said , " that would n't be good . " Pretending to be calm to my familiar helps me to actually be calm . Loiosh accepts this as part of his job , and does n't give - me grief about it , much . In the meantime , without any conscious decision on my part , I was holding a neat , slim stiletto in my hand . Reflexes again . I remained still , counting on Loiosh to tell me if and when I ought to move . While I waited , I contemplated my **25;811;TOOLONG , the sharp , nasty stone that had insinuated itself onto the ground between my shoulder blades . I had a thick layer of darr skin between me and the ground , and a thin layer of chreotha fur between me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loiosh ? " " Brigands come in bands , Boss . Whoever this is , there 's only one of him . " " So the Jhereg is more likely . " " Or something else entirely . " I heard Rocza shift , caught the faint psychic whispers of Loiosh telling her to stay still . Just to fill you in on the basics , in case we have n't met before , Rocza is Loiosh 's mate , which I 'm sure must answer every question you have . " Coming closer , Boss . " " Do I have a target , yet ? " " No . " " Do you have any suggestions ? " " No . But I 'm not worried , Boss . I 'm sure you 'll come up with a plan . " Reptiles are cold blooded ; a reptilian sense of humor will naturally display the same characteristics . This , in spite of being hunted and hounded by a massive and murderous criminal society that wants nothing less than the destruction of my soul , is probably the greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , ignoring his remark . " Fly as silently as you can away from whoever it is , and circle around . As soon as you see " I was interrupted by the ostentatious clearing of a throat , followed by someone saying , " I beg your pardon for disturbing you at such an hour , Lord Taltos , but I 'm certain you must be awake - by now , and I 'm afraid if I come any closer you might do something I 'd regret . " I sat up , the knife poised for throwing . " You ca n't be who you sound like , " I said . " I am , though . " " It 's not polite to lie . " She laughed . " Nor to accuse a friend of lying . " " You ca n't be " " It is , Boss . " " Well , " I said after a long moment . " I 'll be skinned for a norska . " " Probably , " said Loiosh . " But not by her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now see her , but I ca n't see as well at night as he can . " Do n't feel bad , Boss . We ca n't all have adequate vision . " " At least both of my eyes face forward , scavenger . Mind if I make a light ? " I said . " Please do . " I stood up slowly , put my knife away , and found my firekit close at hand . I lit a candle and held it up and away so we would both be illuminated . There was , fortunately , little wind . I saw her standing before me , looking very beautiful and incredibly out of place . She gave me a courtesy , and I bowed in response . " Lord Taltos , " she said . " Lady Teldra , " I replied . " Welcome to the wilderness . " She looked around . " Yes . Well , shall I start , or should it wait until morning ? " " If it is urgent enough to track me down in the middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wait until morning ? " " It can , Lord Taltos . My urgency was to find you before you moved on , thus making the search more difficult . Again , I apologize for disturbing you . " " Not to worry . Did you bring any blankets ? " " I . . . " " I know how difficult this must be for you , Lady Teldra , and I ca n't wait to hear about what brought it all about , but , believe me , we 'll both be better off if you let me handle things for tonight . I 'd prefer it that way . Please . " " Very well . " " Did you bring any blankets ? " " No . " " Is anyone following you ? " " No . " " Are youforgive meare you certain ? " " Yes . " I studied her face . Lady Teldra was worried about something . She was worried enough about something that she had allowed it to appear on her features , and something was wrong enough for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more startling than her sudden appearance in the forest between Appertown and Ridge . Startling . Yes . When one knows an Issola , such as Lady Teldra , one gets so used to the grace , elegance , and manners of the House that one forgets its other side . The issola is a beautiful white bird . I 'd seen several during my recent travels . One usually saw them standing , graceful and lovely in the early morning or late evening , in swamps or the shallow banks of rivers . They stand as if their only reason for being was to look lovely and graceful . And then the issola would be holding a fish in its beak , and you 'd never see it strike . And then the fish would be gone in a single swallow , and the issola would be standing on one leg , looking lovely and graceful . Lady Teldra looked lovely and graceful . I felt plain and clumsy . On the other hand , now that the adrenaline was no longer coursing through my system I realized that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . " You can share my furs , as long as you do n't get forward with me . " " My lord " " I 'm kidding . Climb in . " I blew out the candle . It had been a long time since I 'd slept curled up with a warm bodyit brought back memories that I 'd been trying to suppress , and the fact that she was n't human did little to help me forget . There had been a time when , every night , I had gone to sleep next to a woman I loved , and , even better , woken up with her . Those days were over and beyond recall , and allowing myself to dwell on them could take from me the edge I needed to stay alert and alive .
