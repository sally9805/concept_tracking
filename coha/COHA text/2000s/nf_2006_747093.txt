A random sample of 562 students completed a questionnaire including demographic data ; 20 questions testing knowledge ( right answers scored 1 and wrong answers 0 ) ; and 20 exploring attitudes ( ' yes ' , ' not sure ' and ' no ' ) . Overall , students scored 0.49 for knowledge and 2.30 ( of a maximum 3 ) for attitude . Knowledge scores were classified into high , average and low , and attitudes grouped according to those involving importance , applying and resources . Analysis using Student 's t-test found significantly higher mean scores for females in high knowledge , attitude to importance and overall attitude ; for 18-23 year olds vs. 24-29 year olds for attitude to importance ; for ' science ' colleges vs. ' literary ' colleges for all categories except high knowledge ; for training for attitude to resources ; and for study for all categories except low knowledge . One-way ANOVA across years of university attendance showed no significant difference . Individuals were grouped into those with excellent , medium and poor knowledge and one-way ANOVA performed across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The results showed a close correlation between knowledge and attitude . More training and coursework in first aid at Kuwait University appears to be warranted , with males and those in ' literary ' colleges especially targeted . <p> A basic knowledge and understanding of first aid can be invaluable for individuals to be able to provide emergency care in the event of an accident , possibly saving lives and minimizing injury . It may on occasion obviate the need to visit a hospital or clinic , not only providing convenience for the individual but lessening demand on medical facilities . <p> Many experts believe that even a limited understanding of first aid would be an invaluable service to individuals who find themselves in emergency situations . For example , Sibbald ( 1999 ) reports that the medical profession in Canada has encouraged the teaching of cardiopulmonary resuscitation ( CPR ) to secondary school students in the public schools . Teaching CPR in a school setting allows a way of reaching hundreds of students over a period of time . Glendon , McKenna , Blaylock and Hunt ( 1987 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is probably cost-effective in terms of saving lives . They also recommend that first aid be taught within schools . <p> Engeland , Roysamb , Smedslund and Sogarrd ( 2002 ) studied the implementation of training of first aid to junior high students . The researchers measured the implementation of the program by teachers and the attitudes and knowledge of their students . They discovered that students whose teachers implemented the program enthusiastically had better attitudes toward first aid implementation and were more knowledgeable in first aid . These students also demonstrated higher self-efficacy scores , i.e. , a higher degree of confidence that they could be effective in terms of their skills ( Engelande et al. , 2002 ) . <p> Thornburg ( 2002 ) suggests that , if student athletes are provided with first aid training , this will most likely reduce the extent and severity of injuries that these athletes experience . He promotes students learning techniques to identify their injuries and identify how they should treat them effectively . Consequently , he says , these students have a more positive attitude toward taking care of themselves and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even students who have some level of disabilities are capable of learning basic first aid procedures ( Gast &; Winterling , 1992 ; Marchand-Martella &; Martella , 1992 ) . <p> Research shows that first aid training must be repeated periodically in order to maintain adequate levels of skill and expertise ( Berden , Willems , Hendrick , Pijls &; Knape , 1993 ) . However , this research focuses upon adult training . There is no research to demonstrate whether training in college might be more effective in terms of long-term understanding and retention . College courses require higher levels of study and retention since this type of education and training results in a grade . Thus , students may be more motivated to learn such skills at this level . <p> Adults ( Lester and Donnelly , 1997 ) and the elderly ( Heart Disease Weekly , 30 March 2003 , pp. 25-26 ) have also been investigated as to their knowledge and attitudes to first aid . However , there have been no investigations into the training of college students in first aid practices . This lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level could provide extensive training in first aid procedures , with potential benefit to emergency treatment . <p> Before the last war on Iraq started , Kuwait 's government prepared the people by providing them with first aid training sessions and seminars in schools , colleges , ministries and in different institutes , in addition to information carried in the mass media . Many volunteers helped the government in this campaign and many of them were students either in colleges or in high schools . Basics of first aid were only included in the science curriculum of the fifth grade and in one elective industrial course of a high school . There are also two elective courses in the College of Education which provide some knowledge of first aid . <p> The objectives of this study were , therefore , to discover : the extent of first aid knowledge of Kuwaiti college students as a result of these exposures ; the attitude of college students towards first aid ; factors that have influenced student knowledge and attitudes to first aid ; and any correlation between students ' knowledge and attitudes Methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kuwait University in the 2003 academic year participated in the study . <p> Procedure <p> All participants were given a questionnaire in three parts . <p> The first part asked for specific demographic information , including gender , age , nationality , College attended , attendance at first aid training sessions , and course study of first aid . <p> The second part was a twenty item multiple choice ( three options per item ) test that measured the individual 's knowledge of first aid procedures . Wrong answers were scored zero and fight answers one . <p> The third part was a twenty-item questionnaire measuring attitudes toward first aid , in terms of ' yes ' , ' not sure ' or ' no ' responses to the questions . <p> The questionnaire was constructed by the researcher and has face validity . The reliability was calculated for each of the overall knowledge and attitude variables using Cronbach 's Alpha , giving values of 0.5 for knowledge and 0.66 for attitude , which are within the acceptable range of reliability . <p> Results of the knowledge test were categorized into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals were classified as having poor ( mean score &lt; 0.5 ) , middle ( mean score 0.5-0.7 ) or high ( mean score &gt; 0.7 ) knowledge on the basis of overall scores . <p> The attitude responses were classified into four groups : ' attitude towards importance of first aid ' ; ' attitude towards teaching and applying first aid ' ; ' resources of knowledge in first aid ' ; and ' overall attitudes towards first aid ' . <p> An independent sample t-test was applied on the four knowledge groups and the four attitude groups with respect to gender , age , college , training and studying , while one-way analysis of variance ( ANOVA ) was used to check for correlation between knowledge and attitudes . Results <p> Demographics <p> Of 562 participants , only 165 ( 29.4% ) were male , while 397 ( 70.6% ) were female . Two hundred ( 35.6% ) of the students were first year , 144 ( 25.6% ) second year , 104 ( 18.5% ) third year and 114 ( 20.3% ) fourth year . 92.5% of participating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 93.8% came from Kuwait . The scientific Colleges ( Science , Applied Health , Engineering and Medicine ) with 267 ( 47.5% ) students , and the ' literary ' Colleges ( Education , Social Science , Administrative Science , Art or Literature , Sharia and Law ) with 295 ( 52.5% ) were fairly evenly represented . Eighty seven ( 15.5% ) of participants had attended some first aid training sessions and 230 ( 40.9% ) had studied first aid . <p> Students ' Knowledge <p> Table 1 shows that a high percentage of students had knowledge of first aid procedures in some areas ( e.g. , electric shock ) but very few were knowledgeable in others ( e.g. , unconsciousness with normal pulse ) . <p> Students ' Attitudes <p> In general , students had a positive attitude toward first aid , with a mean score of total responses of 2.30 . However , as shown in Table 2 , responses were uneven towards different statements , varying from a score of 2.79 for ' Hospitals , nurses and ambulances are needed even if everyone knows about first aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first aid procedures for the protection of my family and myself ' . <p> Factors that influence knowledge and attitudes of students <p> As shown in Table 3 , female students were not more knowledgeable than males overall but scored significantly higher in the areas in which students as a whole were more knowledgeable . They were also significantly more positive in their attitudes overall and in their attitude to the importance of first aid . <p> The only significant difference between the two age groups was that students in the younger group were more positive in their attitude to the importance of first aid . <p> Students from ' science ' colleges had significantly higher mean scores in all categories of knowledge and attitude except for ' high knowledge ' . <p> Mean scores of students who had attended first aid training sessions were significantly higher for ' average knowledge ' and attitudes to resources . <p> Students who had undertaken course study in first aid had significantly higher mean scores in all categories except ' low knowledge ' . <p> A one-way ANOVA analysis of results by scholastic year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ categories ( data not shown ) . <p> As shown in Table 4 , mean scores in all the various knowledge and attitude categories increased progressively from the poor knowledge level group to the excellent knowledge level group , suggesting a correlation between knowledge and attitudes . This was explored in a one-way ANOVA analysis ( Table 5 ) , which confirmed the correlation . Discussion <p> Educating even a few people in first aid improves the safety of everyone they come in contact with . Also , a person trained in first aid is more motivated to avoid personal injury , because their first aid training gives them a greater appreciation of the potential serious consequences . Moreover , some trained in first aid can be taught to appreciate the importance of safety , prevention and risk reduction , making them ideal advocates for spreading safety awareness ( First Aid:Ch14Sec4Education  --  Wikibooks , 2004 ) . <p> Knowledge of first aid was not widespread among students at Kuwait University , though the extent of knowledge varied widely among different procedures . This was despite a generally positive attitude toward first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lack of information and training . <p> That the educational establishment is failing in this respect is borne out by the fact that the students indicated the mass media , books and magazines and their own experience of accidents as their main sources of information on first aid , with their field of work or study and their school or college relatively insignificant . That the University is making little contribution is shown by the fact that students ' knowledge and attitudes showed no significant change with their length of attendance at the University . <p> This is unfortunate because both attendance at training sessions and undertaking course study in first aid were found to improve both knowledge and attitudes . It may be , of course , that those with more positive attitudes are more likely to undertake such training or courses . <p> A strong correlation between knowledge and attitudes was found for all categories of knowledge and attitudes . Whether this indicates that attitudes improve with increasing knowledge or that those with positive attitudes are more likely to seek and absorb the knowledge was not explored . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitudes toward giving and learning first aid were important for giving and acquiring knowledge . It is probable that a positive feedback mechanism exists between the two factors . <p> Females scored higher in both knowledge and attitudes than males . This may be due to the ' macho ' ethos of young males that is evident in Kuwait as much as elsewhere . Whether the fact that Kuwaiti government schools are sex-segregated may exacerbate this effect is unclear . What is clear is that it may be necessary to target males to achieve a more widespread knowledge of first aid . <p> However , it is encouraging that younger students ( male and female ) have a more positive view of the importance of first aid . <p> Whether the higher scores in both knowledge and attitude of students in ' science ' colleges as against ' literary ' colleges is due to the mindset of students or staff , or simply due to a greater likelihood of students being exposed to first aid principles is unclear but suggests that a greater effort may be needed to introduce first aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In summary , despite generally positive attitudes , student knowledge of first aid in Kuwait University is only average . Greater access to training sessions and course work in first aid would largely remedy this situation but efforts at improving attitudes of both students and teachers toward first aid would be necessary for maximum benefit . Males and students in ' literary ' colleges should be especially targeted and the areas of weakness of knowledge found in the questionnaire emphasized .
