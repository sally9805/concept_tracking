On stage in the cavernous jazz club below Montreal 's street level , a crimson-lipped singer drawled into the microphone about the cruelty of love . Although her sultry voice was pleasant enough , the lyrics about blood and pain and pleasure clearly heartfelt , Nikolai was n't listening . He wondered if she knew  --  if any of the dozens of humans packed into the intimate club knew  --  that they were sharing breathing space with vampires . <br> The two young females sucking down pink martinis in the dark corner banquette sure as hell did n't know it . <br> They were sandwiched between four such individuals , a group of slick , leather-clad males who were chatting them up  --  without much success  --  and trying to act like their bloodthirsty eyes had n't been permanently fixed on the women 's jugulars for the past fifteen minutes straight . Even though it was clear that the vampires were negotiating hard to get the humans out of the club with them , they were n't making much progress with their prospective blood Hosts . <br> Nikolai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paid for the beer he 'd left untouched on the bar and headed at an easy stroll toward the corner table . As he approached , he watched the two human females scoot out of the booth on unsteady legs . Giggling , they stumbled for the restrooms together , disappearing down a dim , crowded hallway off the main room . <br> Nikolai sat down at the table in a negligent sprawl . <br> " Evening , ladies . " <br> The four vampires stared at him in silence , instantly recognizing their own kind . Niko lifted one of the tall , lipstick-stained martini glasses to his nose and sniffed at the dregs of the fruity concoction . He winced , pushing the offending drink aside . <br> " Humans , " he drawled in a low voice . " How can they stomach that shit ? " <br> A wary silence fell over the table as Nikolai 's glance traveled among the obviously young , obviously civilian Breed males . The largest of the four cleared his throat as he looked at Niko , his instincts no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he was a far cry from civilized . <br> The youth adopted something he probably thought was a hardass look and jerked his soul-patched chin toward the restroom corridor . " We saw them first , " he murmured . " The women . We saw them first . " He cleared his throat again , like he was waiting for his trio of wingmen to back him up . None did . " We got here first , man . When the females come back to the table , they 're gon na be leaving with us . " <br> Nikolai chuckled at the young male 's shaky attempt to stake his territory . " You really think there 'd be any contest if I was here to poach your game ? Relax . I 'm not interested in that . I 'm looking for information . " <br> He 'd been through a similar song-and-dance twice already tonight at other clubs , seeking out the places where members of the Breed tended to gather and hunt for blood , looking for someone who could point him toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't easy finding someone who did n't want to be found , especially a secretive , nomadic individual like Yakut . He was in Montreal , that much Nikolai was sure of . He 'd spoken to the reclusive vampire by phone as recently as a couple of weeks earlier , when he 'd tracked Yakut down to inform him of a threat that seemed aimed at the Breed 's most powerful , rarest members  --  the twenty or so individuals still in existence who were born of the first generation . <br> Someone was targeting Gen Ones for extinction . Several had been slain within the past month , and for Niko and his brothers in arms back in Boston  --  a small cadre of highly trained , highly lethal warriors known as the Order  --  the business of rooting out and shutting down the elusive Gen One assassins was mission critical . For that , the Order had decided to contact all of the known Gen Ones remaining in the Breed population and enlist their cooperation . <br> Sergei Yakut had been less than enthusiastic to get involved . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal clan to protect him . He 'd declined the Order 's invitation to come to Boston and talk , so Nikolai had been dispatched to Montreal to persuade him . Once Yakut was made aware of the scope of the current threat  --  the stunning truth of what the Order and all of the Breed were now up against  --  Nikolai was certain the Gen One would be willing to come on board . <br> First he had to find the cagey son of a bitch . <br> So far his inquiries around the city had turned up nothing . Patience was n't exactly his strong suit , but he had all night , and he 'd keep searching . Sooner or later , someone might give him the answer he was looking for . And if he kept coming up dry , maybe if he asked enough questions , Sergei Yakut would come looking for him instead . <br> " I need to find someone , " Nikolai told the four Breed youths . " A vampire out of Russia . Siberia , to be exact . " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul-patched mouthpiece of the group . He 'd evidently picked up on the slight tinge of an accent that Nikolai had n't lost in the long years he 'd been living in the States with the Order . <br> Niko let his glacial blue eyes speak to his own origins . " Do you know this individual ? " <br> " No , man . I do n't know him . " <br> Two other heads shook in immediate denial , but the last of the four youths , the sullen one who was slouched low in the booth , shot an anxious look up at Nikolai from across the table . <br> Niko caught that telling gaze and held it . " What about you ? Any idea who I 'm talking about ? " <br> At first , he did n't think the vampire was going to answer . Hooded eyes held his in silence , then , finally , the kid lifted one shoulder in a shrug and exhaled a curse . <br> " Sergei Yakut , " he murmured . <br> The name was hardly audible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his vision , he noticed that an ebony-haired woman seated at the bar nearby heard it too . He could tell she had from the sudden rigidity of her spine beneath her long-sleeved black top and from the way her head snapped briefly to the side as though pulled there by the power of that name alone . <br> " You know him ? " Nikolai asked the Breed male , while keeping the brunette at the bar well within his sights . <br> " I know of him , that 's all . He does n't live in the Darkhavens , " said the youth , referring to the secured communities that housed most of the Breed civilian populations throughout North America and Europe . " Dude 's one nasty mofo from what I 've heard . " <br> Yeah , he was , Nikolai acknowledged inwardly . " Any idea where I might find him ? " <br> " No . " <br> " You sure about that ? " Niko asked , watching as the woman at the bar slid off her stool and prepared to leave . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass , but at the mere mention of Yakut 's name , she seemed suddenly in a big hurry to get out of the place . <br> The Breed youth shook his head . " I do n't know where to find the dude . Do n't know why anyone would willingly look for him either , unless you got some kind of death wish . " <br> Nikolai glanced over his shoulder as the tall brunette started edging her way through the crowd gathered near the bar . On impulse , she turned to look at him then , her jade-green gaze piercing beneath the fringe of dark lashes and the glossy swing of her sleek , chin-length bob . There was a note of fear in her eyes as she stared back at him , a naked fear she did n't even attempt to hide . <br> " I 'll be damned , " Niko muttered . <br> She knew something about Sergei Yakut . <br> Something more than just a passing knowledge , he was guessing . That startled , panicked look as she turned and broke for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her . He weaved through the thicket of humans filling the club , his eyes trained on the silky black hair of his quarry . The female was quick , as fleet and agile as a gazelle , her dark clothes and hair letting her practically disappear into her surroundings . <br> But Niko was Breed , and there was no human in existence who could outrun one of his kind . She ducked out the club door and made a fast right onto the street outside . Nikolai followed . She must have sensed him hard on her heels because she pivoted her head around to gauge his pursuit and those pale green eyes locked on to him like lasers . <br> She ran faster now , turning the corner at the end of the block . Not two seconds later , Niko was there too . He grinned as he caught sight of her a few yards ahead of him . The alley she 'd entered between two tall brick buildings was narrow and dark  --  a dead end sealed off by a dented metal Dumpster and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . <br> The woman spun around on the spiked heels of her black boots , panting hard , eyes trained on him , watching his every move . <br> Nikolai took a few steps into the lightless alley , then paused , his hands held benevolently out to his sides . " It 's okay , " he told her . " No need to run . I just want to talk to you . " <br> She stared in silence . <br> " I want to ask you about Sergei Yakut . " <br> She swallowed visibly , her smooth white throat flexing . <br> " You know him , do n't you . " <br> The edge of her mouth quirked only a fraction , but enough to tell him that he was correct  --  she was familiar with the reclusive Gen One . Whether she could lead Niko to him was another matter . Right now , she was his best , possibly his only , hope . <br> " Tell me where he is . I need to find him . " <br> At her sides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ braced slightly apart as if she were prepared to bolt . Niko saw her glance subtly toward a battered door to her left . <br> She lunged for it . <br> Niko hissed a curse and flew after her with all the speed he possessed . By the time she 'd thrown the door open on its groaning hinges , Nikolai was standing in front of her at the threshold , blocking her path into the darkness on the other side . He chuckled at the ease of it . <br> " I said there 's no need to run , " he said , shrugging lightly as she backed a step away from him . He let the door fall closed behind him as he followed her slow retreat into the alley . <br> Jesus , she was breathtaking . He 'd only gotten a glimpse of her in the club , but now , standing just a couple of feet from her , he realized that she was absolutely stunning . Tall and lean , willowy beneath her fitted black clothing , with flawless milk-white skin and luminous almond-shaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strength and softness , her beauty equal parts light and dark . Nikolai knew he was gaping , but damn if he could help it . <br> " Talk to me , " he said . " Tell me your name . " <br> He reached for her , an easy , nonthreatening move of his hand . He sensed the jolt of adrenaline that shot into her bloodstream  --  he could smell the citrusy tang of it in the air , in fact  --  but he did n't see the roundhouse kick coming at him until he took the sharp heel of her boot squarely in his chest . <br> Goddamn . <br> He rocked back , more surprised than unfooted . <br> It was all the break she needed . The woman leapt for the door again , this time managing to disappear into the darkened building before Niko could wheel around and stop her . He gave chase , thundering in behind her . <br> The place was empty , just a lot of naked concrete beneath his feet , bare bricks and exposed rafters all around him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his neck as he raced deeper into the darkness , but the bulk of his attention was focused on the female standing in the center of the vacant space . She stared him down as he approached , every muscle in her slim body seeming tensed for attack . <br> Nikolai held that sharp stare as he drew up in front of her . " I 'm not going to hurt you . " <br> " I know . " She smiled , just a slight curve of her lips . " You wo n't get that chance . " <br> Her voice was velvety smooth , but the glint in her eyes took on a cold edge . Without warning , Niko felt a sudden , shattering tightness in his head . A high-frequency sound cranked up in his ears , louder than he could bear . Then louder still . He felt his legs give out beneath him . He dropped to his knees , his vision swimming while his head felt on the verge of exploding . <br> Distantly , he registered the sound of booted feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ males , vampires all of them . Muted voices buzzed above him as he suffered out the sudden , debilitating assault on his mind . <br> It was a trap . <br> The bitch had led him there deliberately , knowing he 'd follow her . <br> " Enough , Renata , " said one of the Breed males who 'd entered the room . " You can release him now . " <br> Some of the pain in Nikolai 's head subsided with the command . He glanced up in time to see the beautiful face of his attacker staring down at him where he lay near her feet . <br> " Strip him of his weapons , " she said to her companions . " We need to get him out of here before his strength returns . " <br> Nikolai sputtered a few ripe curses at her , but his voice strangled in his throat , and she was already walking away , the thin spikes of her heels clicking over the field of cold concrete underneath him . <br> <br> Chapter Two <br> <br> Renata could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roiled . A cold sweat popped out along her forehead and down the back of her neck . She craved the fresh night air like her last breath , but she kept her stride even and strong . Her fisted hands held rigidly at her sides were the only outward indicator that she was anything but calm and collected . <br> It was always like this for her  --  the aftermath of using her mind 's crippling power . <br> Outside now , alone in the alley , she gulped in a few quick mouthfuls of air . The rush of oxygen cooled her burning throat , but it was all she could do not to double over from the rising pain that was coursing like a river of fire through her limbs and into the center of her being . <br> " Damn it , " she muttered into the empty darkness , rocking a bit on her tall heels . Taking a few more deep breaths , she stared at the black pavement under her feet and focused simply on holding herself together . <br> Behind her came the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the warehouse . The sound drew her head up sharply . Forced a look of cool apathy over the hot tightness in her face . <br> " Careful with him , " she said , glancing at the slack bulk of the big , nearly unconscious male she 'd disabled , and who was now being carried like felled game by the four guards working with her . " Where are his weapons ? " <br> " Catch . " <br> A black leather duffel bag came sailing at her with barely a warning , heaved toward her by Alexei , the appointed leader of tonight 's detail . She did n't miss the smirk on his lean face as the heavy duffel full of metal crashed into her chest . The impact felt like the pounding of a thousand nails into her sensitive skin and muscles , but she caught the bag and swung the long strap up over her shoulder without so much as a grunt of discomfort . <br> But Lex knew . He knew her weakness , and he never let her forget it . <br> Unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Breed , all of them . As was their captive , Renata had no doubt . She 'd sensed as much when she 'd first seen him in the club , a suspicion confirmed by the simple fact that she was able to take him down with her mind . Her pyschic ability was formidable , but not without its limitations . It only worked on the Breed ; the more simplistic human brain cells were unaffected by the high-frequency blast she was able to mentally project with little more than a moment 's concentration . <br> She herself was human , if born slightly different from basic Homo sapiens stock . To Lex and his kind , she was known as a Breedmate , one of a small number of human females born with unique extrasensory skills and the even rarer capability to successfully reproduce with those of the Breed . For women like Renata , ingesting Breed blood provided even greater strength . Longevity too . A Breedmate could live for some long centuries with regular feedings from a vampire 's nourishing veins . <br> Continues ...   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
