Chapter One She had lived a life of terror . A life of deprivation . A life in which nothing had been free or easy . She had learned how to get along in the world any way she could . But she had never been as frightened in her life as she was now . Because the moment was almost here - unless her pounding heart exploded inside her chest , and she died first . " You thought you knew what you were getting into , " she murmured . " But you were only fooling yourself . " Over the past months she had come to understand that the people holding her captive had placed an impossible burden on her shoulders . They had trained her in the skills they said she would need . They had crammed a foreign language and a million facts into her head . They had made her spend hours in the gym , honing her body into a fine-tuned machine . They had hardly given her a moment to herself . But now that the time for departure was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alone , she sat in the molded-plastic chair encased in her tight-fitting one-piece suit . Underneath that layer of protective clothing , her stomach was churning and her heart was racing . She pressed her booted feet to the cement floor and looked at the metal door , waiting for one of them to come get her for the final trip to hell . Her pep talk from Angelo that morning echoed in her head . At first he had sounded almost kind , which was a departure from his usually harsh and frightening tone . " You are tough , " he 'd said . " You are smart , and you are as well prepared as a human being can be . But I can not emphasize enough what I have told you so many times . You must rely on your own skills . You can trust no one . " " But what if I need help ? " " The enemy will try to stop you . Trust no one . They may even be waiting for you . " " How ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went wrong the other times , " he 'd said in a grating voice . The voice she remembered so well . The Angelo she remembered . She might have tried to run away . But there had been no place to go . And she knew Angelo would only hunt her down and punish her for her failure of nerve . So she was here . Waiting for the end of her life as she knew it . Hermosa Harbor was the perfect town for murder , Max Dakota thought as he breathed in a draft of the sea air , then glanced from his fishing line to the pink-and-orange-tinged sky . Well , at least for a murder investigation . He was here on the Atlantic coast of central Florida , in a veritable tropical paradise , with nothing to do but figure out who had dumped Jamie Jacobson 's body in the marshland outside of town . The killers had tried to make it look like an accident . A drunken man falling facedown in the swamp and drowning in a few inches of water . The local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Jamie 's mother was paying the Light Street Detective Agency to solve the murder . Max hoped she was n't going to hate the final report , because he was just getting to the good part . And it was n't pretty . His small boat drifted along one side of the channel leading from the ocean to the harbor . It was n't a particularly good spot to catch smallmouth bass . But it was an excellent vantage point to watch traffic on the fifty-foot-high drawbridge over the channel . Probably some of those vehicles were moving drugs from a storage point to dealers who were going to take the stuff north . Max had been in town for a month , and as far as anyone knew , he was just a guy who 'd pulled out of the dot-com bubble before it burst . Since then , he 'd been enjoying his early retirement . Of course , his last name was n't really Dakota . He had been born Maxwell Daniels , although he had n't actually used that name in a long time . Max @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his spy career . After stowing his fishing gear , he started the outboard motor , then steered toward the bridge , heading back to the marina at a slow pace because this was a high-traffic area . He 'd already learned that Jamie was n't the only poor jerk who had cashed in his chips in Hermosa Harbor in the past few months . A federal agent had been found floating facedown in the harbor . And a local fitness instructor had taken a dive off his high-rise balcony . Max was pretty sure Sheriff Bert Trainer was helping to protect the Hermosa Harbor drug trade . At the least , he was willing to look the other way when shipments moved in and out of the community - probably through Nicki 's Paradise , the favorite nightspot in town . If the owner , Ms. Nicki Armstrong , was n't using the club as a storage depot for pot shipments from the Caribbean , Max would eat his baseball cap . So Max was playing it cool . He 'd spent what looked like an indolent afternoon fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lazy . There was something hanging heavy in the humid air . An unsettled feeling of expectation . Unable to check himself , he looked quickly toward shore . All he saw were small waves lapping against the weeds and a blue heron looking for dinner in the shallows . He should have been reassured , yet he could n't shake the feeling of being in the crosshairs of somebody 's scope . Getting shot in cold blood was unlikely , he told himself . The other recent murders were all set up to look like accidents . Still , he knew something was making the skin prickle on the back of his neck . It was like the tension in the atmosphere as a storm was about to break . It was n't just a feeling in the air . He was picking up an unpleasant smell , too . Taking a deep breath , he tried to place the odor . Ozone . As though lightning had struck something metal nearby . But he had n't seen a flash of light . He was about to chalk up his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd eaten for lunch , when a deep rumbling sound made him jump . Then in front of him , a wavering pattern of light crackled across the darkening sky .
