When Hurricane Ike struck Galveston , a full-time fundraiser went from house-proud to homeless in just hours . I had never thought of furniture floating , but last year , on the evening of September 12 , as Hurricane Ike 's storm surge began flooding my condo in Galveston , I queasily watched as my late aunt 's enormous antique Chinese sandalwood chest lifted from the floor and began an aquatic pas de deux with my great-grandmother 's 19th-century steamer trunk . Clearly , it was time to head for high ground , in this case the windowless hallway between the upstairs units of my vintage 1874 building . As the water streamed under the doors of my first-floor loft , I was able to save only a few treasured possessions : a whimsical MacKenzie-Childs bedside table , a pair of Prada boots . In the eighteen hours that followed , three friends and I listened from above to the ominous banging below and the banshee wails of wind outside as the water rose to almost seven feet in my home . Visualizing the destruction , I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a five-and-a-half-inch speckled trout swam at my feet . When the flood subsided enough that I could venture downstairs , it took only a glance inside my place to confirm that I had indeed lost almost everything I owned : both things I could eventually replace with insurance money , like kitchen appliances and workout clothes , and things I never could , like family photos , my grandmother 's college scrapbooks , paintings and prints I 'd collected over the past thirty-five years . They all drowned in a murky soup of saltwater , bay-bottom silt and diesel fuel from the ruptured gas tanks of boats plucked from the harbor two blocks away and slammed against buildings .

After Vassar , I migrated to Austin for graduate school at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I learned to love the quirky barrier island an hour south . A cross between Savannah and a scaled-down New Orleans , Galveston became my favorite weekend retreat . In 1994 my then husband and I made it our home . Friends who 'd been born on the island ( known locally as BOIs ) warned me that I was taking a risk when I bought my loft in January 2006 . The condo was on the ground floor and , as my pricey flood-insurance policy noted , only nine feet above sea level . But the building was a mile from the beach and protected from the gulf by the ten-mile-long , seventeen-foot-high seawall erected there after the devastating hurricane of 1900 inundated the island , killing more than 6,000 of its residents . My building 's masonry walls were eighteen inches thick ; the floor was polished concrete . Besides , the developer had been sparing with the renovation of the structure , so the price was below market . I could afford to buy the place and fix it up the way I wanted , adding extras like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and a wildly colored metal screen by Houston sculptor Gertrude Barnstone . The nineteen-foot ceilings prompted visions of mezzanines , of space defined by height and function , rather than by solid walls . I went to the bank and went to town . Ten months later , I moved in . Giddy with housepride , I threw a holiday party for 200 and beamed when the Galveston Historical Foundation picked my loft for its annual homes tour . Then , on September 9 , 2008 , Hurricane Ike , originally predicted to come ashore south of Corpus Christi , began turning toward Galveston . At the sprawling campus of the University of Texas Medical Branch there , where I work in the development department raising gifts of $50,000 and up , increasingly urgent notices arrived in our e-mail boxes . Over the course of the next two days , the university 's hospital evacuated all 450 of its patients ( combined with lost revenue , UTMB would end up incurring approximately $710 million in costs related to the storm ) . On Thursday , September 11 , Mayor Lyda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like 15,000 of my neighbors , I disobeyed . I figured I would be safe . The path of the storm was still bending north , toward the Louisiana border . Besides , my building had withstood the 1900 storm and every hurricane since . But despite the seawall , Hurricane Ike , a monster at 400 miles across , pushed the gulf up into Galveston Bay and across the city from the bay side , flooding 75 percent of the island 's structures . Still , except for not being able to reassure relatives and friends that I was okay ( cell-phone towers were down ) , I was glad I stayed . Witnessing the march of the eye across the island made the destruction of most of my belongings easier to accept . With no electricity , no running water and no way to control the flourishing mold , my friends and I left two days after Ike hit . In the Honda Element that one of our crew had had the wit to secure high up in a bank 's parking garage , we threaded our way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we lived like gypsies , staying with a succession of friends and relatives . By the time we were allowed to return to the island , eleven days later , the loft into which I had poured so much money and creative energy was a mucky mess , the drywall stripped out between my unit and the one next door , my furniture and belongings reeking in a pile that stretched from the living room to the back hall . That 's when the grief really hit . Wearing latex gloves and a face mask , I sorted through to rescue my mother 's Lenox Ming dinnerware here , my pearls there . I found an Imari bowl shattered but not even a shard from my favorite piece of art glass . It had been stolen , along with one of my bathroom sinks , a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and a silver serving tray that had been in my family for three generations . Over the ensuing months , I experienced many acts of kindness , however , ranging from the young demolition worker who helped me recover every piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family and friends who gave me shelter in San Antonio , Austin , Houston and higher parts of Galveston . Within a few weeks of the storm , just shortly after electricity was restored to her own house in Houston , a friend sent out an all-points bulletin to her network of girlfriends , calling for handbags and for clothes and shoes in my sizes . Stored in the closet off my mezzanine-level guest room , my cocktail and evening dresses were high and dry , but my business and weekend clothes , as well as my shoes , bags and lingerie , had been ruined . The flood had also inundated my beloved white-over-yellow Mini Cooper . I had lost the essentials I needed to function . Ironically , the generosity of these friends-of-a-friend , women I did n't know , has left me more fashion forward than I was before , my Coach purses replaced by Cartier and Fendi , my Ferragamo pumps with BCBG . I never would have bought that skirt with the asymmetrical hem or those cropped pants in an abstract print , but I love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We thought we 'd be back in our homes by Christmas . Now some Galvestonians are camping out , with one functioning bath and no kitchen , while others , myself included , dream of being back by summer . But no matter : today I have a deeper appreciation of the importance of people and relationships and the relative unimportance of possessions , even heirlooms . And being on the receiving end of largesse has given even me , a professional fundraiser , a new perspective on philanthropy . Whatever the form , whatever the size of a gift to strangers , at the heart of the impulse is empathy , a concern for others that , yes , fills a practical need and helps realize a vision but more essentially connects us to our common humanity . I wear reminders of that every day .
