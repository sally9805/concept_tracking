<p> To get around the chronic labor shortages hampering this traditional textile center and in other industries across Romania , Sorin Nicolescu , who runs a clothing factory , came up with an original solution : import 800 workers from China . <p> " The explanation is very simple , " said Mr. Nicolescu , general manager of a Swiss concern , the Wear Company . " We do n't have any Romanian workers because they have all left to work " in Western and Central Europe . <p> Foreign investors have been attracted to Romania , a poor Balkan country , because of its low wages and , since Jan. 1 , its membership in the European Union . At the same time , those low wages and freedom of movement through Europe , which is now easier , have been fueling a wave of emigration that threatens to slow an economic boom in recent years in Romania . <p> " This was happening before we joined the E.U. , " said Ana Murariu , a production manager at Wear . " Now it 's even worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( and declining 0.2 percent annually ) , received 9 billion euros , or about $12 billion , in foreign direct investment last year . That helped the economy grow last year as much as 7 percent , with an unemployment rate in January of 5.4 percent  --  well below the European Union average . <p> But with monthly wages averaging around $375 after taxes , roughly two million people , or more than 8 percent of the population , have left since the Stalinist government of President Nicolae V. Ceausescu fell in 1989 , according to analysts ' estimates . <p> Italy and Spain are the most popular destinations for Romanian workers , where they usually perform manual labor , legally and illegally , and generally for lower wages than local people . <p> Mr. Nicolescu said he decided to look for workers in China because he had contracts there , and those companies had put him in touch with an employment agency . Those who are hired pay about $2,000 for transportation and the employment agency 's fee , according to one worker . <p> Once they reach Bacau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ northeast of the capital , Bucharest , they go to work in a large , inconspicuous warehouse on the outskirts of town . <p> Inside , about 170 Chinese women operate sewing machines attached to tables stacked with finished and unfinished garments . Most of the tables , arranged in long rows , are empty . The plant expects 500 more Chinese workers by the end of May . <p> The factory is clean , freshly painted and well lighted . The only sound is the rapid , repetitive thud of the sewing machines as the workers stitch together previously tailored pieces of garments . They make mostly sportswear for a range of brands , including Prada and Carrefour . All the production is for export . <p> Mr. Nicolescu said he paid the women about $347 a month after taxes . The legal minimum wage is 132 euros a month ( $176 ) after taxes . <p> The company operated with Romanian workers until 2003 , when operations were suspended because the work force had dwindled to 200 . Mr. Nicolescu said the company had posted hundreds of job offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " It 's very difficult work , and it 's not well paid , " Mr. Nicolescu acknowledged . He said the industry found it hard to attract young workers to replace the current ones , most of whom are nearing retirement . <p> " I 'm not very pleased about working with foreign workers because I have to provide them food and housing " on top of their salaries , Mr. Nicolescu said . That amounts to $130 a month for each employee , he said , in addition to more than $500,000 he has spent building worker dormitories . <p> Critics say the company would find Romanian workers if it offered better wages . But Mr. Nicolescu replied that higher wages would make his products uncompetitive internationally , pointing out that textile manufacturers had already left much of Europe in search of lower costs in regions like China . <p> Cornelia Barbu , deputy director of the Bacau County employment agency , said inspectors had thoroughly inspected conditions for the Chinese workers . " They are treated very well , " she said . " They have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than most of the Romanians living abroad . " <p> Xiu Xian Hong , from Fujian Province , who came here last July , described life as better than in China . <p> " It is quiet here , and the air is much cleaner , " she said through a translator who worked at the plant . " The work is the same , but the pay is more . " But she said she missed her 3-year-old daughter and her husband back home . <p> Ms. Xiu said she had come to Romania because it was the only place being offered when she sought work at an agency in China . She said she planned to stay at least three years , hoping to save enough money to start a business , perhaps a shop , when she returned . <p> Although the city center is easily accessible by public transportation , the workers spend most of their free time in five-bed dormitory rooms in the factory complex , playing cards , reading books and watching Chinese satellite television . <p> Few local residents have seen the workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon said that they had learned about their new neighbors from newspapers and television . <p> " Our people have gone to the West and all over the world , so we need others to replace them , " said Dumitru Padure , a retired aircraft factory technician . <p> Andrea Grigoras , a translator , sitting with her toddler daughter , expressed the view that the Chinese workers received better pay than Romanians and would probably be more focused than Romanian workers . " I know a lot of Romanians who would do the work for less , " she said , adding : " I 'm not worried . But I 'd get worried if there were many foreign workers coming here . " <p> A variety of intra-European transportation links here illustrates the scale of emigration . A discount Romanian-based airline , Blue Air , offers six direct flights a week from Bacau to Italy  --  two to Turin and four to Rome . A bus company , Atlassib , one of many , runs 10 buses daily to Italy from Bacau . <p> The population of Romania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million , by 2050 , according to the Population Reference Bureau in Washington . Villages and towns outside Bucharest have been hit especially hard . <p> Ms. Barbu of the Bacau employment agency suggested that wages would need to reach levels about three-quarters of those in the West for Romanian workers to return . <p> " We have to get used to it because the E.U. means greater mobility , " she said . " Just as we have left , others will come here . " ##
