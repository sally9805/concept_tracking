Chapter One He was the handsomest man in the bar , and he could n't keep his eyes off her . It was all Erin MacNamera could do to keep her own coffee-brown eyes trained away from him . He sat on the bar stool , his back to the multitiered display of ornamental liquor bottles . His elbows were braced against the polished mahogany counter , and he nonchalantly held a bottle of imported German beer in his hand . Against her will , Erin 's gaze meandered back to him . He seemed to be waiting for her attention , and he smiled , his mouth lifting sensuously at the edges . Erin quickly looked away and tried to concentrate on what her friend was saying . " ... Steve and me . " Erin had n't a clue as to what she 'd missed . Aimee was in the habit of talking nonstop , especially when she was upset . The reason Erin and her co-worker were meeting was that Aimee wanted to discuss the problems she was having in her ten-year marriage . Marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a good long while . She was focusing her energies on her career and on teaching a class titled Women in Transition two evenings a week at South Seattle Community College . With a master 's degree clutched in her hot little hand , and her ideals and enthusiasm high , Erin had applied to and been accepted by the King County Community Action Program as an employment counselor , working mainly with displaced women . Ninety percent of those she worked with were on public assistance . Her dream was to give hope and support to those who had lost both . A friend to the friendless . An encourager to the disheartened . Erin 's real love , however , was the Women In Transition course . In the past few years she 'd watched several women undergo the metamorphosis from lost and confused individuals to purpose-filled adults holding on tight to a second chance at life . Erin knew better than to take the credit or the blame for the transformation she saw in these women 's lives . She was just part of the Ways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eldest daughter was destined to become the next Florence Nightingale and Mother Teresa all rolled into one tenacious , determined , confident female . Casey MacNamera was only partially right . Erin certainly did n't see herself as any crusader , fighting against the injustices of life . Nor was Erin fooling herself about finances . She did n't intend to become wealthy , at least not monetarily . Nobody went into social work for the money . The hours were long and the rewards sporadic , but when she saw people 's lives turned around for good she could n't help being uplifted . Helping others through a time of painful transition was what Erin had been born to do . It had been her dream from early in her college career and had followed her through graduate school and her first job . " Erin , " Aimee said , her voice dipping to a whisper , " there 's a man at the bar staring at us . " Erin pretended not to have noticed . " Oh ? " Aimee stirred the swizzle stick in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the room , her eyes studying the good-looking man with the imported ale . Her smile was slow and deliberate , but it did n't last long . She sighed and said , " It 's you who interests him . " " How can you be so sure ? " " Because I 'm married . " " He does n't know that , " Erin argued . " Sure he does . " Aimee uncrossed her long legs and leaned across the minuscule table . " Married women give off vibes , and single men pick them up like sonar . I tried to send him a signal , but it did n't work . He knew immediately . You , on the other hand , are giving off single vibes , and he 's zeroing in on that like a bee does pollen . " " I 'm sure you 're wrong . " " Maybe , " Aimee agreed in a thin whisper , " but I doubt it . " She took one last sip of her drink and stood hurriedly . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what happens . My guess is that the minute I 'm out of here he 's going to make a beeline for you . " She paused , smiled at her own wit , then added , " The pun was an accident , clever but unintentional . " " Aimee , I thought you wanted to talk .... " Erin , however , was n't quick enough to convince her friend to stay . Before she 'd finished , Aimee had reached for her purse . " We 'll talk some other time . " With a natural flair , she draped the strap of her imitation-snakeskin handbag over her shoulder and winked suggestively . " Good luck . " " Ah ... " Erin was at a loss as to what to do . She was twenty-seven , but for the majority of her adult life she 'd avoided romantic relationships . Not by design . It had just worked out that way . She met men frequently , but she dated only occasionally . Not once had she met a man in a bar . Cocktail lounges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd probably been inside one only a couple of times . Her social life had been sadly neglected from the time she was in junior high and fell in love for the first time . Howie Riverside had asked her to the Valentine 's Day dance , and her tender young heart had been all aflutter . Then it had happened . The way it always had . Her father , a career navy man , had been transferred , and they 'd moved three days before the dance . Somehow Erin had never quite regained her stride with the opposite sex . Of course , three moves in the next four years - unusual even for the navy - had n't been exactly conducive to a thriving relationship . They 'd been shuffled from Alaska to Guam to Pensacola and back again . College could have , and probably should have , been the opportunity to make up for lost time , but by then Erin had felt like a social pygmy when it came to dealing with men . She had n't known how to meet them , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor had she acquired a number of the other necessary graces . ( Continues ... )
