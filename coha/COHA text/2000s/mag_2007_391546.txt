Headnote A New Film Documents a Corrupt but Lucrative International Conspiracy Diver and filmmaker Rob Stewarts plans started going to hell in 2002 , while he and his film crew were steaming toward Costa Rica aboard the Ocean Warrior , a ship captained by Paul Watson , founder of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society . Stewart could n't wait to get underwater and film sharks in high-definition cinematography at the incomparable marine reserves of Costa Rica 's Cocos Island and Ecuador 's Galapagos Islands . The Toronto-born " shark geek " and former chief photographer for the Canadian Wildlife Federation magazines wanted to show movie audiences that sharks are tentative toward humans , easily spooked , rather than Jaws-like man-eaters . What he did n't plan to uncover in his new documentary , Sharkwater , is the fact that humans are the far more deadly predators . While in Guatemalan waters , the Warrior came across a fishing boat , Varadero , illegally " finning " sharks-a process in which a shark 's fins are sliced off and the hacked body , usually still alive , is tossed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which means trailing monofilament lines up to 100 miles in length with up to 8,000 baited hooks set on each line . " These fishing boats are death traps , " says Watson . " They have no anchors , no life-saving equipment and no firefighting equipment . These guys are lost at sea all the time and no one cares . They 're just as expendable as the sharks . " Captain Watson radioed the Varadero , ordering that it immediately stop processing sharks . But the fishermen defied him . The confrontation resulted in the Warrior and Varadero colliding rails , after which the fishing captain surrendered . " We hauled him in for arrest under the instruction of the Guatemalan government , " recalls Watson , whose agents sank the bulk of Iceland 's whaling fleet in 1986 . The Warrior is customized with " can openers , " metal spikes extending out from her lower bow that can peel open another ship 's hull , and its operations are credited with ending pirate whaling in the Atlantic . Watson might have claimed the cooperation of the Guatemalan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received word via radio that a Guatemalan gunboat was on its way-to arrest him and his crew . " The Varadero crew accused us of shooting at them , which we did n't do , " says Watson . " Obviously what had happened is bribes had passed hands . We were doing the government a favor and , next thing you know , we were the bad guys ... I got charged with eight counts of attempted murder . " Watson and his crew were put under house arrest aboard the Warrior , docked in Puntarenas , by the Costa Rican government . " This happened despite the fact that the president of the country had invited us there , " says Stewart . For weeks , the Warrior sat in port as the crew awaited prosecution . Stewart 's underwater filming dreams were crushed , replaced by a nightmare of international legal wrangling . Until he realized he was in the middle of a fascinating story . To find out why the Costa Rican judicial system was pinning an attempted murder conspiracy on them , Stewart absconded from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip that the Taiwanese mafia ( the " Shark Fin Mafia " ) was running an underground operation in the private dock area of Puntarenas , outside the scrutiny of public port inspectors . Shark fins all over Asia were being traced back to Costa Rica , where the Taiwanese land and process their catch . This was allegedly sanctioned by certain Costa Rican officials between 2002 and 2006 , when former President Abel Pacheco was in office . Stewart was able to film " factory after factory " with thousands of fins drying on the roofs before being chased away by gun-wielding goons . When Stewart re-boarded the Warrior , Watson decided to flee the country and the bogus charges . With the Costa Rican Coast Guard pursuing and threatening machine-gun fire , the Warrior made it out into international warriors . The ship moved on to the Galapagos , where Stewart was anxious to film hammerhead sharks . More disappointment waited . " Instead of finding hammerheads in all their majesty underwater , I found hundreds of them dying on 60 miles of illegally set longlines , " says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , even in the most protected areas on the planet like the Ecuadorian National Park and a World Heritage Site , sharks are being killed . I realized I needed to get this story out there , because people just do n't know what 's happening . " The Varadero incident helped create international media attention and public outcry . Thousands of Costa Ricans rallied against shark finning in the streets . Even so , foreign industrial vessels , mostly Taiwanese disguised under different flags , continue to land shark fins in Costa Rica and other pockets of Central America . But there have been recent gains , owing to a new Costa Rican government that is open to legal reforms put forth from locally based nonprofit groups , including Mar Viva and PRETOMA . " Of 50 international flag vessels that landed shark fins in Costa Rica between 2002 and 2005 , now less than 10 land per month , " says Randall Arauz , president of PRETOMA , a marine conservation organization working to promote sustainable fisheries policies in Central America . Costa Rica is now leading a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring sharks into port with their fins still attached . Says Arauz , " Most of these vessels have moved to other nations such as Guatemala and El Salvador to land their products , and that 's why it 's important to get the fins-attached requirement as a regional and global policy . " The multibillion-dollar shark industry is alive and well , controlled by Taiwan but fueled by China-where shark fin soup is considered a delicacy and a status symbol worth up to $400 a bowl . The fins are worth 100 times more by weight than simple shark meat in Asian markets . Worldwide , scientists estimate that 100 million sharks are killed for their fins annually . But Stewart , who spent four years making the film , shooting in 15 countries , has witnessed change in Asia . " Young people are n't into shark fin soup at au . It 's mostly the older people , " he says . " There 's a big movement on the ground in China against shark finning and against the production of shark fin soup . There are " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars such as Jackie Chan and other big Asian celebrities are speaking out against it as well . " <p>
