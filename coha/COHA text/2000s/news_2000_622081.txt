<p> Whether they 've been on the bruising end of his fury or just watched it from a safe corner , those who know Morris Engelberg say it 's no mystery why the flamboyant lawyer is fighting to keep Joe DiMaggio 's name off a playground in San Francisco . <p> He never flinches from an ugly fight . <p> And he gets in a lot of them . <p> He has battled DiMaggio 's friends , relatives of his own clients , entire cities  --  basically , anyone who gets in his way . Or more accurately to his way of thinking , in the way of his clients . <p> And if there is one thing that defines his life , it is a consuming adulation of DiMaggio , whose estate he serves as executor . He may be suing to block the Yankee Clipper 's name from going on North Beach Playground , but he named his own office complex after him , has DiMaggio 's name on his license plate , and when he pitches DiMaggio 's memorabilia up for auction , he blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Some call it obsessive . Engelberg calls it love . <p> " I 'm not a villain , not the big wheel here . Joe is the commander-in-chief , " the 60-year-old Engelberg said in an interview from Hollywood , Fla. , where he lives next door to the house where DiMaggio , who died of cancer in March 1999 , spent his final years . " And let me tell you , I loved that man like a father . I 'm just carrying out his orders . " <p> If it were up to him , he would n't have a single headline about the whole playground flap , Engelberg said , voice rising to an insistent , stentorian shout . " I 'm a low-key guy , just like Joe was . He pumped his own gas , he never turned down a child 's request  --  he was a simple man , and I am even simpler . <p> " He would turn over in his grave if he knew this was happening . I 'm not bringing down his name . I 'm protecting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can think of a lot of words to describe what Engelberg is doing to DiMaggio 's name , but protect is not one of them . <p> David Singer of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce got into a nearly identical flap with Engelberg last year when he proposed that the city name its biggest traffic circle after DiMaggio . <p> " I was met with almost universal excitement and glee by everyone else in the community , " Singer said . " And then in the middle of it all , we all got this threatening letter from Engelberg  --  City Council , chamber board , everyone  --  saying we were using the DiMaggio name and the family did n't want this , threatening to sue us . <p> " I 've never seen anything like this , where such a good-natured , well-intentioned thing that could only honor the person and the city was met with such a nasty threat . " <p> THREATS OF COURT ACTION <p> He said he has his theories for why Engelberg is so confrontational , but , " I should n't say , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the guy . " <p> It 's an oft-voiced fear . Few who have fought with him actually want to go on the record attacking him . <p> Those who have bowed to his will include New York Gov . George Pataki , who was persuaded by Engelberg not to name a road after DiMaggio , and the daughter of one of his other famous clients , Madame Bee Alexander . <p> The dollmaker 's will upon her death in 1990 left most of her $12 million estate to daughter Mildred Birnbaum , but Engelberg argued for an earlier version that named him executor with a fee of about $200,000 . Eventually , he settled out of court for an undisclosed amount . <p> Foremost among Engelberg 's jousting partners is the Yankee Clipper 's last surviving brother , Dominic " Dom " DiMaggio , legendary in his own right as a diamond star . <p> Dom visited his dying brother regularly during Joe 's final months , helped move him home from the hospital and flew in a doctor for a second opinion , his attorney said . But by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who became DiMaggio 's manager in the 1980s and controlled virtually all the information coming from him . <p> HOSPITAL ARGUMENT <p> When it became apparent to Joe DiMaggio that he had cancer , Engelberg said , the slugger told him to keep his condition secret  --  which he did , even to Dom , leading to an ugly argument in a hospital corridor . <p> Dom DiMaggio filed court papers this week recounting how the brothers learned baseball on the playground Engelberg has never seen and refuses to have renamed , and he insists that Joe would have " loved to have his name on it . " He is so tired of fighting with Engelberg that he recoiled at the mention of his name . <p> " I do n't really care to discuss Mr. Engelberg , " he said quietly in an interview from his Massachusetts home . <p> A similar sentiment comes from Barry Halper , memorabilia collector and part owner of the New York Yankees , who was a pal of DiMaggio 's for 25 years . When Halper wrote a New York Daily News column @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cease and desist " letter telling him DiMaggio was " never your friend , he only tolerated you . " <p> Those in Engelberg 's corner admire his spunk . <p> " He 's tough and firm , but he does his job , " said Frank Sacco , who has known Engelberg for several years as the head of the chain that runs Joe DiMaggio Children 's Hospital in Florida . " That 's what I would expect from an attorney in his position . <p> " People have it all wrong about him . He 's not like some of them say . " <p> A GOOD FRIEND <p> Jeffrey Herman , the Miami lawyer assisting on the lawsuit to block the renaming of the playground , said there is no better friend to a man in need than Engelberg . <p> " He 's willing to go out on a limb for you , " Herman said . " He 's a real fighter . " <p> Engelberg , for his part , ticks off a list of complaints about the way San Francisco and the media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contention that he never called the North Beach Playground " a dump " or said it was unworthy of Joltin ' Joe 's name . <p> He accuses city leaders of waiting for an election year to name something after DiMaggio and of angling for their own interests . One of the idea 's biggest boosters , Supervisor Gavin Newsom , owns properties near the playground , Engelberg said , and would prosper from the naming . <p> Newsom 's properties , which include the Balboa and Plump Jack cafes , are actually far from the playground : The field is at Mason and Lombard streets , and the restaurants are 14 blocks away on Fillmore . The same self-interest accusation , about Dom 's property at Fisherman 's Wharf , was attributed to Engelberg  --  but the lawyer now says his words were twisted . <p> " That 's just amazing , " chuckled Newsom when informed of the accusations . " He 's sinking very low . " <p> No matter about the details , Engelberg says . The nut of the matter is still true . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't want his name on it , " Engelberg said . " It 's cement ! Pick a nice little grammar school in an underprivileged section , or a hospital for underprivileged kids , and we 'll talk . " <p> BIOGRAPHER 'S SUPPORT <p> Actually , not just Dom , but Richard Ben Cramer , whose biography of DiMaggio is due this fall , says DiMaggio grew up playing on that field . " There 's no question but that Joe had a special fondness for that playground and pointed it out to several friends , " said Cramer . Engelberg " is , as usual , misinformed , " he added . <p> Considering the sphinxlike reputation DiMaggio acquired , tightly controlling his group of friends and refusing to support his name going on much of anything , anywhere  --  including his birth town of Martinez , where he was a no-show for naming ceremonies on a street and ball fields in the 1980s  --  Engelberg may actually be just the right lawyer for the Clipper . <p> Engelberg had built a solid practice as a tax lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved there from San Francisco for tax advantages . <p> Engelberg soon became his manager and good pal , making DiMaggio godfather to one of his grandsons . He named his office complex " Yankee Clipper Center , " stuffing it with DiMaggio memorabilia , and got a license plate reading " DIMAG5 . " Of both homages : " He loved it , " Engelberg said . <p> As manager , he acquired a reputation for zealously controlling who got to talk to the star , and for just as industriously guarding his money interests . This included helping DiMaggio make the most of the booming sports memorabilia and autograph-signing market . <p> That marketing work is still going strong , and Engelberg maximizes its worth to the estate . <p> FLAP OVER JERSEY <p> He recently sold one of DiMaggio 's jerseys to Upper Deck , the card manufacturer , and when critics ripped him because the company intends to shred the cloth into card-package shards , he was quoted as saying , " Joe would have cared if he was still alive , but he would n't care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that his offerings for auction at Christie 's East were overpriced this spring , Engelberg angrily responded that the items did n't sell because the auction house offered them too late in the day , when " the bidders were out of money . " <p> And now comes the fight over the playfield . Engelberg filed suit this month in federal court in Miami to block the naming , and its next hearing date is Tuesday . <p> The whole thing has DiMaggio 's old friends in San Francisco aghast , but Engelberg says that just proves they were n't really his friends . Otherwise they would understand , he said . He said he is working the case at no cost to the estate or to DiMaggio 's heirs . <p> To this , DiMaggio pals like restaurateur Ed Moose say : " Phooey . " <p> Moose said a decade ago he was in a steam room with DiMaggio and mentioned that North Beach Playground was already referred to as DiMaggio field , and he was met with a smile . He took that as tacit approval , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as he watches the court fight ramp up , he is taking his own action . <p> " We have a fund , and we 've raised $13 so far , to send Mr. Engelberg on a vacation anywhere except San Francisco , " Moose said . " He 's a beautiful villain , given us a lot of laughs . "
