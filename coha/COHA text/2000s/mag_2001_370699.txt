Chinese citizens celebrated wildly on Tiananmen Square  --  even the normally dour police force whooped it up  --  when Beijing won the 2008 Olympic Games . But it did n't take long for dissidents , whom China does n't tolerate well , to raise objections . " They will tear down our homes , waste our water and charge us high taxes , just so they can host a stupid event to look good for the rest of the world , " wrote a disgruntled resident in an online chat room . Liang Congjie , top environmental adviser to the Beijing Olympic bidders , shares those concerns . " My greatest worry is that the committee will focus on making Beijing into a showcase city with water-wasting stretches of grass , " he says . Other fears are that work on improving wastewater treatment and mass transit will slow as the city shifts its construction funds to building competition venues . Beijing has seven years to prove otherwise . <P>  --  Reported by Hannah Beech/Beijing              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
