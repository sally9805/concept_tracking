The truncheons seemed excessive . Marta Manojlovic was already on the ground  --  helpless and bleeding from a head wound  --  when the Serb cops worked her over with the hard rubber batons . As she faded into unconsciousness , the cops started in with the kicks , as if her midsection was an errant soccer ball . Manojlovic is 17 , and small for her age . But she disturbs the security men who are responsible for keeping Slobodan Milosevic jammed into power . <P> Given a choice , Manojlovic would like nothing better than to be like other teenagers . A fan of Guns N ' Roses , she enjoys history and wants one day to teach . But even if she had a degree , she says , there are n't any jobs . Her once prosperous family lives in a crumbling , communist-era apartment on the edge of Belgrade , while her father , formerly a banker , peddles Nikes door to door . " I deserve better  --  we all deserve better , " she says . She turns to show a welt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this country is going to change until people realize that they have to take personal risks . " <P> Manojlovic has been taking extreme risks . She is one of a growing number of young Serbs  --  30,000 by the latest estimates  --  who have joined the movement known as Otpor , Serbian for resistance . Virtually unknown until a few months ago , the group is generating as much anti-Milosevic heat as anything since the end of the NATO campaign a year ago . Otpor has few leaders , relying instead on an informal web of student connections . And unlike the country 's traditional opposition groups , which spend more time jockeying for power than pushing for change , Otpor has no political ambitions , according to its supporters , just a desire to be a catalyst . <P> The government is taking notice . Senior officials have charged the group with terrorism and with being " paid lackeys " of the West . Hundreds of members have been arrested and released . Officials even shut down universities to prevent gatherings . Says an Otpor spokesman wryly : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The movement 's tactics include harshly humorous " actions . " Over Easter , members handed out eggs symbolizing the regime , saying to recipients , " It is hard , but it will break . " Slacker slogans such as " Bite the system ! " are everywhere . At a smoke-filled gathering recently , members debated how to sabotage the official opening of an apartment block . " Let 's send guys up on the rooftops and shower people with leaflets , " suggested a member . Not good enough , rejoined a frail girl : Spray the building with graffiti the night before ! The mischievous atmosphere evaporated , however , when someone 's mother called to say her son had been arrested . " It 's the third time this month , " said the girl . " We have to get him out . " For Otpor , getting out of jail is becoming an increasingly necessary habit . <P>  --  Reported by Dejan Anastasijevic/Belgrade
