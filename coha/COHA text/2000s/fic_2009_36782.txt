Cambridgeshire , 1885 <p> It had been no marriage at all . <p> Mariah crossed the well-groomed park as she had done every day for the past few months , her walking boots leaving a damp trail in the grass . Tall trees stood alone or in small clusters , strewn about the park in a seemingly random pattern that belied the perfect organization of the estate . <p> Donbridge . It was hers now . Or should have been . <p> No one will ever know what happened that night . <p> The maids had blushed and giggled behind their hands the next morning when she had descended from her room into the grim , dark hall with its mounted animal heads and pelts on display . She had run the gauntlet of glassy , staring eyes , letting nothing show on her face . <p> They did n't know . Neither did Vivian , the dowager Lady Donnington , for all her barely veiled barbs . Giles had left too soonsuspiciously soon . But no one would believe that the lord of Donbridge had failed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did he sense something wrong ? <p> She broke off the familiar thought and walked more quickly , lifting her skirts above the dew-soaked lawn . She was the Countess of Donnington , whether or not she had a right to be . And she would play the part . It was all she had , now that Mama was gone and Papa believed her safely disposed in a highly advantageous marriage . <p> Lady Donnington . In name only . <p> A bird called tentatively from a nearby tree . Mariah turned abruptly and set off toward the small mere , neatly oblong and graced by a spurting marble fountain . One of the several follies , vaguely Georgian in striking contrast to the Old English manor house , stood to one side of the mere . It had been built in the rotunda style , patterned after a Greek temple , with white fluted columns , a domed roof and an open portico , welcoming anyone who might chance by . <p> A man stood near the follya shadowy , bent figure she could not remember ever having seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But there was something very odd about him , about the way he started when he saw her and went loping off like a three-legged dog . A poacher . A gypsy . Either way , someone who ought not to be on the estate . <p> Mariah hesitated and then continued toward the folly . The man scuttled into the shrubbery and disappeared . Mariah paused beside the folly , considered her lack of defenses and thought better of further pursuit . <p> As she debated returning to the manor , a large flock of birds flew up from the lakeshore in a swirl of wings . She shaded her eyes with one hand to watch them fly , though they did n't go far . What seemed peculiar to her was that the birds were not all of one type , but a mixture of what the English called robins , blackbirds and thrushes . <p> She noticed at once that the folly seemed to have attracted an unusual variety of wildlife . She caught sight of a pair of foxes , several rabbits and a doughty badger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the foxes was remarkable in itself , but that all should be congregating so near the folly aroused an interest in Mariah that she had not felt since Giles had left . <p> Kneeling at the foot of the marble steps , she held out her hands . The rabbits came close enough to sniff her fingers . The badger snuffled and grunted , but did n't run away . The foxes merely watched , half-hidden in the foliage . Mariah heard a faint sound and glanced up at the folly . The animals melted into the grass as she stood , shook out the hem of her walking skirt and mounted the steps . <p> The sound did not come again , but Mariah felt something pulling her , tugging at her body , whispering in her soul . Not a voice , precisely , but  --  <p> Her heart stopped , and so did her feet . You 're imagining things . That 's all it is . <p> Perhaps it would be best to go back . At least she could find solace in the old favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants would leave her alone . <p> But then she would have to endure her mother-in-law 's sour , suspicious glances . You drove him away , the dowager 's eyes accused . What is wrong with you ? <p> She dismissed the thought and continued up to the portico . There were no more unexpected animal visitors . The area was utterly silent . Even the birds across the mere seemed to stand still and watch her . <p> The nape of her neck prickling , Mariah walked between the columns and listened . It was n't only her imagination ; she could hear something . Something inside the small , round building , beyond the door that led to the interior . <p> She tested the door . It would n't budge . She walked completely around the rotunda , finding not a single window or additional door . Air , she supposed , must enter the building from the cupola above , but the place was so inaccessible that she might almost have guessed that it had been built to hide a secret a secret somebody did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where her prodigal husband stored the vast quantity of guns he must need to shoot the plethora of game he so proudly displayed on every available wall of the house . <p> But why should he hide them ? He was certainly not ashamed of his bloody pastime , of which she 'd been so ignorant when she 'd accompanied him to England . <p> Defying the doubts that had haunted her since Giles 's departure , she searched the portico and then the general area around the folly . Impulse prompted her to look under several large , decoratively placed stones . <p> The key was under the smallest of them . She flourished it with an all-too-fleeting sense of triumph , walked back up the stairs and slipped the key in the lock . <p> The door opened with a groan . Directly inside was a small antechamber with a single chair and a second door . The room smelled of mice . <p> That was what you heard , she thought to herself . But she also detected the scent of stale food . Someone had eaten in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that man she 'd seen loitering about the place with such a suspicious air . <p> But why ? <p> She stood facing the inner door , wondering if the key would fit that lock , as well . <p> Leave well enough alone , she told herself . But she could n't . She walked slowly to the door and tried the key . <p> It worked . Though the lock grated terribly and gave way only with the greatest effort on her part , the door opened . <p> The smell rolled over her like the heavy wetness of a New York summer afternoon . A body left unwashed , the stale-food odor and something else she could n't quite define . She was already backing away when she saw the prisoner . <p> He crouched at the back of the cell , behind the heavy bars that crossed the semicircular room from one wall to the other . <p> The first thing Mariah noticed was his eyes black , as black as her husband 's but twice as brilliant , like the darkest of diamonds . They were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair , true silver without a trace of gray . And the face <p> It did n't match the silver hair . Not in the least . In fact , it looked very much like Lord Donnington 's . Too much . <p> She backed away another step . I 'm seeing things . Just like Mama . I 'm <p> With a movement too swift for her to follow , the prisoner leaped across the cell and crashed into the bars . His strong , white teeth were bared , his eyes crazed with rage and despair . He rattled his cage frantically , never taking his gaze from hers . <p> Mariah retreated no farther . She was not imagining this . Whoever this man might be , he was being held captive in a cell so small that no matter how he had begun , he must surely have been driven insane . A violent captive who , should he escape , might strangle her on the spot . <p> A madman . <p> Her mouth too dry for speech , Mariah stood very still and forced herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whipcord muscle ; the tendons stood out on his neck as he clutched the bars , and his broad shoulders strained with tension . He wore only a scrap of cloth around his hips , barely covering a part of him that must have been quite impressively large . Papa , for all his talk of her " starting a family , " would have been shocked to learn that she knew about such matters , and had since she first visited Mama in the asylum at the age of fourteen . <p> The prisoner must have noticed the direction of her gaze , because his silent snarl turned into an expression she could only describe as " waiting . " <p> " I beg your pardon , " she said , knowing how ridiculous the words sounded even as she spoke them . " May I ask do you know who you are ? " <p> Anyone else might have laughed at so foolish a question . But Mariah knew the mad often had no idea of their own identities . She had seen many examples of severe amnesia and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tossed back his wild , pale mane and closed his mouth . It was a fine mouth above a strong chin , identical to Donnington 's in almost every way . Only his hair and his pale skin distinguished him from the Earl of Donnington . <p> Surely they are related . The prospect made the situation that much more horrible . <p> " My name , " she said , summoning up her courage , " is Mariah . " <p> He cocked his head as if he found something fascinating in her pronouncement . But when he opened his mouth as if to answer , only a faint moan escaped . <p> It was all Mariah could do not to run . Perhaps he 's mute . Or worse . <p> " It 's all right , " she said , feeling she was speaking more to a beast than a man . " No one will hurt you . " <p> His face suggested that he might have laughed had he been able . Instead , he continued to stare at her , and her heart began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said , the words out of her mouth before she could stop them . <p> The man 's expression lost any suggestion of mirth . He touched his lips and shook his head . <p> He understands me , Mariah thought , relief rushing through her . He is n't a half-wit . He understands . <p> Self-consciousness froze her in place . He was looking at her with the same intent purpose as she had looked at him studying her clothing , her face , her figure . <p> She swallowed , walked back through the door , picked up the chair and carried it into the inner chamber . She placed it as far from the cage as she could and sat down . It creaked as she settled , only a little noisier than her heartbeat . The prisoner stood unmoving at the bars . <p> " I suppose , " Mariah said , " that it wo n't do any good to ask why you are here . " <p> His lips curled again in a half snarl . He did n't precisely growl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I understand , " she said , swallowing again . " I can leave , if you wish . " <p> She almost hoped he would indicate just such a desire , but he shook his head in a perfectly comprehensible gesture . Ah , yes , he certainly understood her . <p> The ideas racing through her mind were nearly beyond bearing . Who had put him here ? <p> There are too many similarities . He and Giles must be related . A lost brother . A cousin . A relative not once mentioned by anyone in the household . <p> Insane thoughts . It was her dangerously vivid imagination at work again . <p> And yet <p> This prisoner had obviously not been meant to be found . And with Donnington gone , she could n't ask for an explanation . <p> Dark secrets . It did n't surprise Mariah that Donbridge had its share . <p> This man is not just a secret . He 's a human being who needs your help . <p> She twisted her gloved hands in her lap . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do you think you can answer a few simple questions by moving your head ? " <p> His black eyes narrowed . Indeed , why should he trust her ? He was being treated like an animal , his conditions far worse than anything Mama had ever had to endure . <p> She examined the cage . It was furnished with a single ragged blanket , a basin nearly empty of water and a bowl that presumably had once contained food . <p> " Are you hungry ? " she asked . <p> He pushed away from the bars and began to pace , back and forth like a leopard at the zoo . She had an even clearer glimpse of his fine , lithe body : his graceful stride , the ripple of muscle in his thighs and shoulders , the breadth of his chest , the narrow lines of his hips and waist . <p> Heat rushed into her face , and she lifted her eyes . He had stopped and was staring again . Reading her shameful thoughts . Thoughts she had n't entertained since that night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , waiting for Donning-ton to make her his bride in every way . <p> " Shall I bring you food ? " she asked quickly . " A cut of beef ? Or venison ? " <p> He shook his head violently , shuddering as if she 'd offered him dirt and grass . But the leanness of his belly under his ribs told her she dared not give up . <p> " Very well , then , " she said . " Fresh bread ? Butter and jam ? " <p> His gaze leaped to hers . <p> " Yes , " she said . " I 'll bring you bread . And fruit ? I remember seeing strawberries in the conservatory . " <p> Hope . That was what she saw in him now , though he moved no closer to the bars . Who saw to his needs ? She had no way of knowing and had every reason to assume the worst . <p> " You also require clothing , " she said . " I 'll bring you a shirt and trousers . " His eloquent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit you very well . " <p> Because he and Donnington were as close to twins as any two men Mariah had ever seen . <p> The Man in the Iron Mask had always been one of her favorite stories . The true king imprisoned , while the brother ruled in his stead <p> " Your feet must be sore , " she went on , her words tripping over themselves . " I can bring you shoes and stockings , and undergarments , as well . Blankets , of course , and pillows . What else ? " She pretended not to notice how ferociously focused he was on her person . " A comb . Shaving gear . Fresh water . Towels . " <p> The prisoner listened , his head slightly cocked as if he did n't entirely take her meaning . Had he been so long without such simple comforts ? Yet his face lacked even the shadow of a beard , his hair was not unclean , and his body , though not precisely fragrant , was not as dirty as one might expect . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the estate knew every detail of this man 's existence , and she intended to find the jailer . <p> She resolved , in spite of her fears , to try a new and dangerous tack . " Do you do you know Lord Donnington ? " <br> Continues ...
