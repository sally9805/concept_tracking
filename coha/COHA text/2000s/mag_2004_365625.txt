When BRITNEY SPEARS got hitched in January , it was a quickie ceremony in Vegas that stunned her family and ended in annulment . After eight months of personal growth , Spears , 22 , walked down the aisle again , on Sept. 18 , in a quickie ceremony in Los Angeles that stunned her family and got hung up by a prenup . To evade paparazzi , she exchanged vows with backup dancer KEVIN FEDERLINE , 26 , at what was to have been their engagement bash , a month before the planned nuptials . " I was like , ' What are we waiting for ? ' " Spears told PEOPLE . But when they said I do , one detail was amiss . Lawyers advised the couple , who opted for a prenup agreement and signed a marriage license , to wait a grace period after inking the prenup . They have not filed the signed license , which , Federline told PEOPLE , they 'll do this week . So , Mama Spears , there 's still time for intervention .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
