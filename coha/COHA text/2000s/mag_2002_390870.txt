AYURVEDIC CUISINE HELPS HOW YOU FEEL AND HEAL Photograph Fresh vegetables and fruits , left , plus a variety of grains and spices are the components of Ayurvedic cooking . // When Eileen Keavy Smith first read about Ayurveda several years ago , she was amazed to learn that what you eat can affect how you feel . Smith was so intrigued that she began to study this ancient Indian system of healing . She learned that imbalances in any of the three doshas-Voto , Pitto and Kapha ( see sidebar , p. 57 ) - that govern all living things can affect health , and that diet can help restore balance , and with it , health . Ayurveda made intuitive sense to her . For the first time , she understood why she had severe sinus congestion every spring , even though repeated tests found no allergies , and why she had heartburn in the summer , but at no other time during the year . She began experimenting with what she ate and found that by changing her diet in the spring , she could control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the wonderful ripe tomatoes from her garden in the summer , the heartburn completely disappeared . Books about Ayurvedic nutrition often feature Indian cuisine , which is not surprising given Ayurveda 's Indian roots . But many recipes , with their emphasis on fresh , wellcooked and carefully seasoned foods , are time-consuming to prepare . Smith , a librarian in Tallahassee , Florida , quickly discovered that having to cook every meal from scratch ; using fresh , locally grown organic ingredients ; and carefully adjusting seasonings and ingredients in each dish for individual doshas was not compatible with a full-time job . So she began looking for ways to adapt quick and easy family favorites to meet Ayurvedic guidelines , recognizing she could not always find fresh , locally grown produce or avoid leftovers and frozen foods . With advice from dietitian friends , she modified the US Department of Agriculture 's Food Pyramid for each dosha to show which specific foods in each category-oils and sweeteners , dairy foods , seasonings such as black peppercorns and fresh ginger , protein foods , vegetables and fruits and grains-help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down what she was doing . So she did . The result is The Quick and Easy Ayurvedic Cookbook , an easy guide to help understand how to use this ancient system to improve one 's own health . " It was written for people like me who work full-time , ca n't afford a cook and ca n't afford the luxury of cooking everything from scratch , " she says . Translated from Sanskrit ( ayur means life and veda means science ) , Ayurveda means " science of life , " or " the knowledge of life , " and is based on maintaining balance among the doshas that govern each living being . Ayurveda has its roots in the 3,000- to 5,000-year-old Indian traditions , which show how to achieve perfect health , something the ancient sages considered a natural and normal state . According to their teachings , anything less indicated an imbalance . By heeding the intelligence of nature , which is within each individual , each person has the ability to achieve perfect health . The teachings of the ancient vedic physicians were followed for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when India was under foreign rule . The teachings were rediscovered after India 's independence by vedic scholars who recognized that , for thousands of years , there had been a natural , effective approach to health . The tradition was introduced to the West largely through the efforts of Maharishi Mahesh Yogi , better known as the founder of Transcendental Meditation . He recognized that while modern medicine might treat disease , it did not necessarily lead to health . The Maharishi has been a leader in the current effort to revive Ayurvedic knowledge and have it verified by modern science . Photograph // While diet is only one component of an Ayurvedic lifestylemeditation , massage , the practice of yoga are others-the essentials of the ancient , Ayurvedic approach to nutrition can be readily incorporated into a modern lifestyle , as Smith 's and other cookbooks show . Debunking the Myths A variety of misperceptions about the Ayurvedic diet need to be dispelled . The first is that Ayurvedic and Indian cooking are the same . Though much Indian cooking adheres to the principles of Ayurveda , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be adapted to accommodate the native cuisine of any culture . Another misperception is that the Ayurvedic diet is strictly vegetarian . While it is ideal for vegetarians , Smith says she could find nothing in the literature that prohibits the use of meat . But , in The Ayurvedic Cookbook , author Amadea Morningstar explains , " Ayurveda has been a predominately vegetarian form of healing for centuries due to the religious practices and perspectives of the vast majority of its Hindu practitioners . " Yet another stumbling block is how to figure out your own doshic constitution . Self-tests are a staple in books about Ayurveda , but tests often do n't provide the same results , which can be confusing . An accurate assessment should be made by a qualified Ayurvedic practitioner . Glen Crowther , who teaches nutrition at the Ayurvedic Institute in Albuquerque , New Mexico , thinks people who want to follow an Ayurvedic diet often are trapped by the idea that they must structure a diet according to whichever dosha predominates . However , all three doshas are present in every being , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as time of day , season , age of life and environment . That 's why Crowther suggests a more straightforward approach , emphasizing moderation , fresh foods and nothing that is extreme in flavor , rather than trying to identify the needs of a particular doshic makeup . He suggests some basic guidelines for an Ayurvedic diet : Place an emphasis on fresh , locally grown , organic foods . This means eating foods that are in season and avoiding processed foods . Foods should be eaten the day they are prepared , which discourages the use of leftovers and prepackaged foods . Foods should be " hot , " or thoroughly cooked . This reflects the Ayurvedic emphasis on good digestion , considered more fundamental to health than the actual foods consumed . Cooking helps predigest foods-especially important with the rice and legumes that are staples of the Indian diet . Smith 's dosha-modified food pyramids suggest foods to favor or to avoid to help balance your doshas . But focusing on the six tastes that , according to Ayurvedic tradition , ought to be included in each meal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six tastes include : sweet , such as bread , milk and honey ; sour , such as vinegar , yogurt and lemons ; salty , such as salt and soy sauce ; bitter , such as mustard greens and rhubarb ; pungent , such as hot spices , chilies , garlic and ginger ; and astringent , such as lima beans , apples and pomegranates . These tastes help determine whether a food is " heating " or " cooling . " Generally , sour , salty and pungent tastes are heating , whereas sweet , bitter and astringent are cooling . For balancing , it helps to know that Vata tends to be balanced by foods that are sweet , salty and sour but elevated by those that are bitter , pungent or astringent ; Pitta is balanced by those which are sweet , bitter and astringent but elevated by sour , salty or pungent tastes ; and Kapha is balanced by pungent , bitter and astringent tastes , but elevated by sweet , sour or salty tastes . Photograph // In practice , this means someone with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curries that would be useful for a Kapha or Pitta , who , in turn , might be wise to avoid the pickles , ice cream or yogurt that appeal to Vata . Certain spices-ginger and black pepper in particular-are useful for balancing all three doshas . There is more to Ayurvedic nutrition , however , than the food , flavors or tastes . As Crowther points out , while one aim of Ayurveda is to follow a diet that brings your unique constitution into balance , your diet can be perfectly balanced in every way and still not produce the good health you desire if you eat and live in a stressed environment and you do n't digest your food properly . It should be obvious that the principles of Ayurvedic nutrition run counter to today 's tendency to ingest fast , heavy , fried and junk foods , and " eating on the run , " all of which tend to create or exacerbate imbalances . Accordingly , Ayurveda places great emphasis on when and how food is eaten . A regular schedule is important , and meals should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an interval of four to six hours . Heavy meals should be eaten at noon , and sweets should begin , not end , a meal . Ideally , food should be lovingly prepared and slowly eaten in a relaxed setting . While Ayurvedic physician Jack Ebner explains that Ayurveda does not lend itself to " soundbites , " the experiences of Smith and others show that you can follow the principles and still prepare quick meals that , eaten in the right setting , might lead to better health . The following simple recipes show how different combinations of sauteed fresh vegetables , tossed with pasta , can meet individual doshic needs.Working with ingredients recommended for balancing each of the doshas , you are limited only by vegetables that are available according to season-and by your imagination-so feel free to experiment , especially with the many seasonings that can brighten meals .

Sidebar What 's Your Dosha ? Sidebar The term " dosha " has no equivalent in the English language , but any discussion of Ayurveda must include the three doshas-Vata , Pitta and Kapha . The goal of Ayurveda is to establish balance in each of these three doshas.When they are in balance , according to Ayurveda , health is optimal . But , just as there is no good synonym for " dosha , " there is also no quick and easy definition . Jack Ebner , an Ayurvedic physician who practices in Seal Beach , California , explains , " it is hard to give soundbite answers . " The doshas represent several fundamental combinations of elementsair , water , heat , ether and earth-present in all living things , a concept fundamental to the philosophy and practice of Ayurveda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misleading . Every individual has elements of all three , but in a unique doshic composition , much like a fingerprint . Using the three primary colors as an analogy , Ebner explains that , like the colors of a rainbow , the number of possible combinations is infinite . To complicate the explanation even further , doshas are influenced by time of day , seasons , age and a host of other factors . Here are the basic properties of the three doshas , signs of imbalance and steps that help bring them back into balance . * 1ata , a combination of air and ether , represents motion.The primarily Vata individual is tall and lean with an alert , imaginative mind and active body.Travel , worry , cold , dry and windy weather tend to imbalance Vata , leading to erratic sleeping and eating , weight loss , mood swings , dry or chapped skin , muscle spasms , cramps and excessive anxiety , fear and worry.Vata increases with age , and is most prominent in autumn.Vata is balanced by regular eating habits ; warm , heavy and oily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raw and undercooked vegetables , cold foods and drinks , dry , light and crispy foods and snacking between meals should be avoided . * Pitta combines fire and water and is responsible for metabolism . The Pitta individual is of Sidebar medium height and build , has reddish , thin hair that grays early and hazel eyes . This individual needs regular meals and does n't tolerate hot weather well.The Pitta individual also is energetic , intelligent , assertive and organized , but tends to be demanding and critical . Skin rashes , inflammation , temper tantrums and excess sweating are symptoms of imbalance , which is highest in hot summer weather or can be brought on by sunburn , hot and spicy foods and infrequent meals . Pitta is balanced by sweet , bitter and astringent tastes , eating at regular times , cool foods , salads and sweet fruits . The Kapha individual , water and earth , typically is big boned , has thick hair and big eyes , walks and talks slowly and gains weight easily . In balance , the Kapha individual is calm and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Signs of Kapha imbalance include sinus congestion , headcold or bronchitis , letharagy , weight gain and mild depression , imbalances that often occur in late winter and early spring or may be brought on by heavy meals , cold food and drinks and too many rich foods or sweets . To balance Kapha , try pungent or spicy , bitter , and astringent tastes , warm foods and drinks and plenty of exercise .
