FANS GATHERED TODAY AT the Los Angeles grave of dead rocker Tom Paine on the twenty-fourth anniversary of his death . Paine , lead singer of the Seventies group Commonsense , has been called The First Goth . The fans , who left black roses and paperback copies of Dracula , were a mix of aging baby boomers and newer acolytes , like this young gothette : <p> What is it about Tom Paine that attracts your generation ? <p> Blond girl , black garb and eyeliner , long blond hair . <p> " I speak only for myself . " <p> What draws you ? <p> " His death . " <p> What ? Pathetic and broke ? Of a heroin overdose in a cheap motel ? <p> " The vampires did n't get him . " <p> Johnny Goldberg ( former rhythm guitarist , Commonsense ) : We were so sincere then . Naive . <p> When we said , like The Who , that we hoped we 'd die before we got old , we meant it . We were so afraid of winding up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we realize that they were the Heroic Generation , who survived the Depression and sacrificed in World War II - But when we were growing up , all we saw was the conformity , the repression , the hypocrisy . <p> Paine did it . He died before he got old . <p> 500 AlI Time Greatest Rock Albums , number 462 ; Rites of Man , Tom Paine and Commonsense . This fusion of hard rock , blues , and off-the-wall mysticism rocked to 6 on the Billboard chart , where it stayed for seven weeks in 1972 . Songs " Sunrise Blues " and " The Vampire 's Wife " reached 8 and 13 respectively on the singles chart that year . Singer/songwriter Paine never equaled this success , but the band continued until 1974 . Their triumphant concert finale is considered one of the most dramatic shows of the decade and paved the way for acts like Kiss and Ozzy Osborne . Paine died in 1976 of a drug overdose . <p> Joe Dearth ( Former rock critic , The Haight Ashbury Love Standard ) : This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know where the whole vampire thing came from . Back then , if you were into vampires you were some geek who collected Famous Monsters of Filmland and watched Dark.Shadows after school . Or stayed up late to catch Bela Lugosi and Christopher Lee on Creature Features on Saturday night .... You know , dateless wonders . I always preferred the big monster flicks . There was this one where a giant octopus attacks San Francisco and tears down the Bridge and the Ferry Building . It was lame . Victims had to actually run up to a pier and volunteer to get smashed . <p> Guiseppi Scapellini Assistant Professor , Contemporary Music History , San Francisco State University ) : In the terms of the youth culture of the day , vampires symbolized either the older generation , attempting to suck the life of rebellious youth , or controlling women . Tom Paine took the metaphor and ran with it . <p> Johnny Goldberg : We were really distant cousins-in-law . That was when he was still Emanuel Lipinsky . We met at a bar mitzvah in the Valley - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both listened to this station that only came in late at night , XERB I think it was , that played delta blues . We were big Buddy Holly fans too . Everyone else we knew was listening to surf music , or Paul Anka . <p> When the Beatles came over , we grew our hair in cute little moptops and formed a group . The Rubber Band . We thought that was a great name , real witty . <p> We played in the Los Angeles All City Junior High Battle of the Bands . Every school had a Rubber Band . <p> We lost . We were awful . <p> Andy Shipp ( former roadie and later drummer , Commonsense ) : Were we at Woodstock ? No way , man . <p> Altamont ? We did n't play , but we went to the show . You know when Many Balin starts yelling at the Angels to stop trashing people ? That was me they were beating up . Yeah . Well , I think . We all dropped acid and it 's kind of a blur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't know . Got a smoke ? <p> Last song , last concert : Tom Paine caressing the guitar strings , then pausing to sing . <p> " Never gon na get old , <p> Never gon na die . <p> Never gon na get old , <p> Never gon na die . " <p> Guiseppi Scapellini : If you simply look at the way a person plays guitar , it says a lot about him , and the image he wishes to project . The old bands - the surfers , the British invasion - they held their guitar here , in front of their chests . It gives good control over the instrument and it also makes them seem almost cute , like they 're cuddling something they cherish . <p> The bad boys , the rockers who thought they were dangerous , started dropping the guitar further and further , until it seems to sprout out of the crotch like an erect phallus . Now , in fact , a proper guitar is slung so low that the player has to slump or bend at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tradition to hold the guitar up high , like McCartney . Otherwise he could n't have played those phenomenal blues riffs . <p> I predict that the greatest cause of disability in future rock guitarists will be sciatica , not heroin . <p> Andy Shipp : Peoples ' Park ? Yeah , we were there . I had a van , you know , so I got to hang out with the band and meet girls ' n ' stuff . Oh , and I scored the grass . <p> Peoples ' Park . Yeah . I got beat up by the cops . <p> Concert at Peoples ' Park , Berkeley , 1969 : Five earnest looking boys in colonial garb , playing folk rock . Tom Paine and Johnny Goldberg , wearing tricorner hats over powdered hair , play electric guitar . Covers of Dylan , Ritchie Havens , Country Joe and the Fish , and a final almost inspired rock version of " We Shall Overcome . " <p> Johnny Goldberg : We were at Berkeley , and really got into the student protest thing . End the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Women 's Lib ? No way , man . They were still just chicks then . <p> We were in this band where we took revolutionary names . I was Johnny Tremayne , because I was a physics major and did n't know a lot of history , but I remembered the movie . We did the Sons of Liberty song . The Disney lawyers learned of it , and took out an injunction . But no one had actually heard of us , we were totally obscure except on campus , so I 'm told they sued Paul Revere and the Raiders . They were the band that played for Dick Clark on Shindig . They wore costumes too , and were probably dumbfounded when the Disney machine went after them . Or this may have just been one of Andy 's paranoid raps . Memory , you know ? <p> He actually got his name legally changed to Tom Paine . Good move . Emanuel Lipinsky is not a babe-magnet name . And Tom was a magnet . <p> The rest of us ? Well , rhythm section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Paine 's sister Flower , you know ? Judith . I had n't seen her since high school , and she shows up one day with this long blond hair like the girl on Mod Squad . Man , I just worshipped her . Forever . <p> Andy Shipp : They were gods to me . See , I was a music major and I had no talent whatsoever . I knew all this history and theory and I could babble criticism with the A students , but I was entirely uncreative . And here 's Tommy , this guy who 's a philosophy major , and he 's got this ability to sing and write and marry chords that never had even shaken hands before . <p> My roomie was their first drummer . I hung around and just sort of became their roadie . I had the VW microbus . We painted it paisley which seemed cool , but it made the cops always suspicious and they 'd pull us over .... <p> I started learning drums , figuring you did n't need a lot of talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dorm said I was bothering them , and beat me up . <p> This is one of those new music clubs , the New Beat on Irving , where today 's youth come to drink espresso and listen to new rock bands , who can only dream of the day when they may be big enough to play at the Fillmore . <p> Hippies and weekend hippies at the table . Band barely seen through the smoke and old videotape . Tom Paine on lead , Johnny Goldberg on rhythm , both in denim pants and jackets , long hair , Goldberg with an almost rabbinical beard . Paine 's sister Flower in a long tie-dyed gown , hunched over her electric bass , back to the audience . A disheveled , obviously drunk drummer . <p> A dark-haired woman in sunglasses sits alone at a table in front , stirring a cup of coffee . Three other untouched mugs sit before her . She watches Paine intently . <p> Andy Shipp : I knew this guy who had this house in the upper Haight , and everyone decided to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we got in on their lease . It was one of those spooky old narrow Victorians with bay windows that survived the Earthquake and Fire . It creaked a lot . Maybe that 's when Tommy got into all the mystic stuff . <p> Anyway , he was a philosophy major and the job market is n't exactly crying out for those , so he decided to become a rock legend . We starved , man . We had these hopeless little gigs and played parties and dealt some grass on the side , and survived on brown rice and vegetables that Flower cooked . <p> Johnny Goldberg : I graduated with honors in physics , and realized that if I went to grad school I 'd either wind up teaching or working for the military industrial complex , so like Leary said , I turned on , tuned in , dropped out . I could do it because I did n't need the student deferment . I was 4F for acne . Honest . If you had really bad acne on your back , they were afraid it would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had to go for another physical at the draft board , I 'd quit screwing and eat a lot of chocolate for a couple weeks . <p> Paine thought he was going to wind up in Vietnam , so it was live fast and have a good time before you die young . He was like a candle trying to bum out before it gutters , you know ? Then the draft lottery came in and he was like number 360 or something , and it was a reprieve . He started concentrating on the music again , and we got better gigs . We became house band for this place on Irving that was owned by an old Beatnik poet , who felt all we hippies were his kids or something . Just doted on us . <p> It was down from the UC Hospital on Parnassus , and medical students would come by . Some of thegirls had been science majors with me at Berkeley and it was funny . There they never liked me but now they could n't wait to get involved . Free love and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flower but she was still a virgin , can you believe it ? And these chicks were like practically flinging themselves at us . I was n't nuts , you know . <p> Guiseppi Scapellini : There are two ways to think of it . The first is that the Sixties ended early , with Altamont and the Chicago riots , with the assassinations of Bobby Kennedy and Martin Luther King , each new tragedy another stake in the heart of idealism . <p> In actuality , the Sixties lingered on until Nixon left office and the Vietnam War ended . Four years of slow death - of aging , moral compromise , and growing self-centeredness . <p> By the time Commonsense got to San Francisco , the Summer of Love was barely a memory . The Haight-Ashbury was no longer a dichotomy of straight and cool . It had become a world divided between the predators and the victims . <p> Johnny Goldberg : So we 're playing , and our drummer - this guy named Beechnut , honest - was always stoned and that night he 'd taken something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting slower and slower and Flower is like whispering and nudging him but something weird is happening . <p> There 's this woman who came to the place at least three nights a week . She 's got long black hair and is very pale , wears black . Very beatnik , I guess , and she was old . At least thirty . Back then it was Never trust anyone over thirty . Now , I 'm like Never trust anyone under thirty and I 'm getting to the point where I 'm getting suspicious if you 're less than forty . But she was gorgeous . <p> Anyway , she always sits in the front row of tables with coffee cooling in front of her , rebuffs anyone who comes near , and stares at Paine . He 's interested - who would n't be , in a Mrs. Robinson sort of way ? But she intimidates us . <p> So this night , Beechnut gets slower and slower and then he sort of wilts over his drum set and slides to the floor , and it 's kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then it 's real noisy as the cymbals get pulled over on top of him . <p> We 're looking at him and for once there are n't any med students or interns in the audience . Then this woman - Sage , that was her name  --  stands up and walks over . She bends over and examines him , then beckons to Andy our roadie and says , " Take him outside and call an ambulance . Too many barbiturates . He needs to go to Casualty - to an emergency room . " <p> She 's commanding . The sort of compelling attitude that makes you follow generals into battle or preachers into mass suicide . And she 's got this upper-class English accent . And any English accent , of course , just makes you unbearably cool . <p> Paine says , " Wow , thanks , like are you a nurse or something ? " There were a few women doctors back then , but it did n't occur to you . <p> She just says , " I 'm a drummer . " Frankly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a doctor . Women in rock groups sang and played maybe a tambourine , except there was one all chick band - Ace of Cubs or something - playing the Haight , and it did n't really matter if they were any good , just that they did it . I think Samuel Johnson said that . I 've gotten into literature now that I 'm older . We were strange enough that we had Flower on bass . <p> Oh yeah , Velvet Underground had a girl drummer . But that was New York and they were trying to be as weird as they could . <p> Then Sage lifts Beechnut , granted he was a speed freak and real skinny and no teeth either , and puts him in Andy 's arms , and starts to reset the drum kit . So we let her sit in , and she was good . Not flashy like Ginger Baker , just solid , held a beat , knew when a little snare or cymbals were called for . <p> After the last set we went home and she just came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's bedroom with him . The walls were thin , and I did n't get much sleep until she left , right around dawn . <p> Joe Dearth : I lived in North Beach , but I had a girlfriend in the Sunset . Okay , she was just a kid but I 'd go over when her parents were away . The Sunset is this completely boring district built on sand dunes , south and west of Golden Gate Park . The streets are alphabetic north/south , and numbers east/west , until you run into the ocean . It 's gridlike and boring and bourgeois , except for this area where my girlfriend lived in the Funstan hills , where the perpendicular streets bent and twisted and intersected . It was like the Twilight Zone , and I 'd always get lost and just drive around in the fog till I saw her street . I called her my demon lover and sometimes I 'm not really sure the whole thing was n't some Poe fantasy , except I ran into her recently at a comedy shop and she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sometimes she 'd sneak out and we 'd go to the coffee shop . I was n't all that impressed by Commonsense . They were , well , an okay cover band with delusions of grandeur . Paine wrote some nice stuff , but it was uninspired , like a bluesy Jim Morrison without clinical insanity , and they just were n't good enough musicians to carry it off . I had a crush on Flower 's back - who did n't ? - but then they got this incredible , hot new drummer named Sage . It was like the band suddenly had a backbone . Like they were crawling up out of the sea to evolve . <p> Andy Shipp : Sage was wonderful . She like exuded sex appeal . I did n't try anything because now she was Tommy 's old lady . She thought it was amusing that I wanted to be a drummer , despite having no talent , and she would give me lessons . Only at night . We never saw her before sunset and she always left before the sun came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work on my drumming in the middle of the night . Well , I 'd drum and she 'd come down in a robe , hair all messy-you knew they 'd just finished some bang-up sex - and she 'd show me another riff to Team and go back into the house . Knowing what they were up to while I was pounding the drums - man , it was inspiring . It 's probably why I 'm as adequate as I am . <p> Sometimes you could still hear me from the street , and the cops 'd come by and beat me up . <p> Joe Dearth : The band kept getting more and more interesting . Not just because they now had the sexiest rhythm section in the history of-the world . <p> No , their blues sound got harder , and the lyrics were mystical and romantic yet death oriented . Not like the teen death songs of the early sixties - Last Kiss , Teen Angel , Tell Laura 1 Love Her . It was like Death is some higher plane that will make our love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drummer . Flower kept her innocent hippie virgin look , and their rhythm guitarist , I ca n't remember his name , he always looked like a Hasidic science nerd stoned on pot . Even later , when they were the big act and wore costumes , he wore this Victorian suit and looked like , I du n no , Professor Van Helsing 's rabbi . They started singing a version of Sunrise Blues back then , still primitive . <p> Let 's make the night last , because every morning you die , and every morning I die without you . <p> Johnny Goldberg : There may be something else in nature more dramatic or pathetic than a young man hopelessly in love for the first time , but I do n't know what it might be . The Black Plague , maybe , or the last passenger pigeon , or continental drift . You got me . <p> Andy Shipp : One night she 's late . Sage does n't show , and we start the first set without her , Flower trying to carry the beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sage walks in with this tall skinny English guy in , honest to God , a tweed suit . He seemed ancient to me . He must have been forty or something . <p> Have you noticed how people then looked older ? I mean , you look at Bogart or those guys from the old movies , when they were forty they looked ancient . I do n't think it 's just me getting older . It 's better nutrition and less tobacco and antibiotics , something prosaic like that probably , but this guy , he seemed timeless . <p> Sage drags him up on stage and says , " This is Gage . He wants to sit in . " Tom gets all huffy . I think we all realized that this dude was , not her husband , her master or something . She was his mistress . That was cool then , a guy practically owning a girl . Real cool . What bothered us was that he seemed so old . <p> But his suit was son of old fashioned and he 's got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I du n no , Mr. Chips auditioning with the Stones . Some weird discrepant glitch in reality . Rod Serling about to narrate . <p> " Give him your axe , " she says , so Tommy does . <p> Joe Dearth : The drummer arrived late with an older man who took Paine 's guitar . He hit the strings , tuned one or two with this unnerving sneer . " Crossroads , " he says . <p> We all thought , this guy is completely straight . Back in the Sixties , straight meant not hip . It had nothing to do with sexual orientation . Though , of course , everyone 's parents pretty much are always straight . ) What can he do ? <p> And he does Clapton riffs . Perfect single string blues like B.B. King . Dropdead quality string-slamming Townsend . Even a touch of Hendrix wa-wa . It was like you go to the Twin Peaks Elementary School Christmas Pageant , and Pavarotti steps on stage . <p> Flower is the first to enter in , turning around for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this guy as she plays . Worshipping him . Then the rhythm guy joins in , and Sage on drums . Paine is clenching his fists - this guitarist is so good , it 's clear he 's not really needed . So he sings . <p> Johnny Goldberg : It was incredible . Everyone cheered . The old guy says , " Statesboro Blues , " so we play that . <p> Then Paine says , " Okay , enough , I want my Fender back . " <p> The old guy grins . " Sunrise Blues , " he says . So of course Paine has to sing it , and it achieves , I do n't know , heights of passion and sorrow . Because it 's about a guy whose girl leaves him every morning for her husband or whatever , and now those two lovers are fighting it out on stage . <p> At the end of that , even Paine realized the dude had to stay . He could hate him all he wanted , fear him , but now we were going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I came back every night I could , and never wrote about it . Word of mouth was already making it hard to get in . It was a small club . <p> The show was almost as good as the music . The lead guitar and the singer were fighting over the drummer on stage . They 'd be leaning in toward her , addressing solos and lyrics directly at her . Grinding against the guitar , caressing the microphone , God ! At times it was almost pornographic . <p> Andy Shipp : It was crowded , and people might get rowdy waiting for the band . I was doubling as a bouncer , like coffee houses needed bouncers . " I 'm sorry , sir , you 've had enough cappuccino , I 'll have to call a cab . " <p> I was a lousy bouncer . I got beat up a lot . <p> Come on baby , do n't you weep . <p> You 'll see your husband when you sleep . <p> Tonight is just for you and me . <p> A night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wife , " Tom Paine , Rites of Man . <p> Guiseppi Scapellini : It 's odd . I was at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame when they had the exhibit of early blues . There was an old photograph from the Thirties of Robert Johnson and some other doomed blues pioneers . A tall white man was standing with them , half turned away from the camera . The caption identified him as " Picadilly Slim . " <p> When I next saw the film of Commonsense 's last concert , I looked at the guitarist and said , " My God . It 's Picadilly Slim . " <p> Of course , it could n't be . There was a thirty-five year gap between the photograph and the film . But it looked awfully like him . <p> Johnny Goldberg : Paine was my buddy , man . We 'd been best friends since we were thirteen . We shared everything - except the chicks , and even some of them . Never Sage , though . <p> So now we 're growing apart . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the band , and I 'm fading into the background , not even going to be a Trivial Pursuit question like the backup guys in the ) imi Hendrix Experience . It 's that he 's obsessed . He 's spending all day writing this incredible music and practicing guitar - like he wants to be able to fight it out with Gage in some musical duel . <p> Gage always leaves right after the show , so Sage comes home with us . One day the old guy looks at Flower and beckons to her . <p> Paine grabs his sister and holds her by the arm . <p> Gage says - and his voice is even more quiet and commanding than Sage 's , only menacing too - " You have my woman . You must lend me one of yours . " <p> It was all very melodramatic . Andy , our roadie at the time , makes a run at the old guy , who just knocks him down . I was going to be next , but Flower holds out her hand to him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want to enjoy her innocence and naivety , to inhale the scent of the bloom before it fades . " <p> And I hate to say it , she really did blossom . She started wearing black too , with plunging necklines , and sticking her tongue between her teeth all pensive-like as she fondled the bass , and sort of writhing instead of just being one of those comatose bass players like before . I was so jealous I could have died . <p> But we were getting lots of groupies then too , so it was n't like I was hard up or anything . <p> Joe Dearth : My girlfriend became pregnant and was sent off to a home for unwed mothers in the midwest . I kept going to The New Beat , and one day I saw Bill Graham there . Between sets he went up , handed his card to Paine , said something . <p> Shit , I thought . Here goes my secret spot , the hidden club that is so cool only the cognoscenti know about it . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there 's a sax , a piano , a standup bass and a drummer who sticks to brushes . I was so depressed . <p> Andy Shipp : They 're going to audition for the Fillmore . Man , it 's like this old movie with I think Judy Garland or Mickey Rooney , and they put on a show and Flo Ziegfield is in the audience . Or did I dream that ? Anyway , we go home and we 're all , even Gage , hitting the wine . And Sage and Tommy go into his bedroom , and after a while Gage picks up and follows them . <p> I 'm thinking , Whoa , cool , universal love and three way sex , man . We 'll all be rich and famous , even me the roadie , and have group sex too . It 'll be like heaven . <p> Or else Gage 'll try to kill him and I 'll get beat up again . I keep drinking - we were celebrating , we bought Boone 's Farm Apple Wine which was 95 cents for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out on the cushions . <p> I want to spend the night with you , <p> And dream away the sunrise blues . <p> - " Sunrise Blues , " Tom Paine , Rites of Man <p> Johnny Goldberg : I wound up in bed with Flower , which was very nice , but her heart was n't really in it . It was almost like she 'd been asked , no , told to keep me occupied . We never made love again . After that it was just groupies for the both of us . Yeah , there are male groupies but they 're generally called musicians or journalists . <p> Next afternoon , when we get up , we 've like got to get ready for the audition . But Paine 's still in bed , and Gage and Sage too , one presumes . We wait , and finally ca n't wait anymore and knock on the door . <p> The rooms like a disaster . Well , it always was , but there 's sheets and stuff all over , and it 's clear a good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked , alone . <p> " Come on , man , get dressed . We got a gig , " I say . " Where 's the others ? " <p> " They 're gone , " he says . " They wo n't be coming back . " <p> " Son of a bitch ! " I scream . " What 'd you do ? We were gon na be stars ! " <p> I grab him by the pits and haul him up so I can berate him face to face . I can only think about how he 's pissed off the important part of the band , and we 're nothing without them . <p> " I gave her my soul , " he says . " And he took my talent . " <p> " Whiny asshole , " I say , and let go . And he falls down like he 's an empty sheet : <p> Rolling Stone , Sept 1971 . Singer Tom Paine of the San Francisco cult band Commonsense was hospitalized at University of California Medical Center with severe anemia , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Fillmore . Assistants to impressario Bill Graham issued this statement : " We Il still let him audition , if he survives . " <p> Andy Shipp : They gave him four units of blood and kept him in the hospital three weeks . They did every test they knew , looked everywhere the sun do n't shine , but never found out what caused it and it did n't come back . <p> He was real depressed , would n't move or talk . <p> They called in a shrink who decided Tommy 's fascination with vampires and the occult had led him to drain his own blood . They were going to transfer him to the mental hospital , but we busted him out . <p> I knew some roadies for the Dead . They were on tour but let us stay up at their ranch at Forest Knolls , over in Marin , while Tommy recuperated and we practiced . He 'd really improved on the guitar , and I could fake the drumming okay , so we got the Fillmore gig . We were good , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others . I do n't know why they left . We would 've been , I do n't know , immortal . It would've.been , like , Hendrix , Dylan , the Beatles , the Stones , and Commonsense . Man . <p> Guiseppi Scapellini : Tom Paine 's Commonsense played seven weeks in a row at the Fillmore . Their first album , Rites of Man , came out soon after , in ' 72 , earning them a place in rock history for their meteoric rise and brief anticlimactic career . They simply never repeated their early success . The subsequent albums were still fine quality music , but they never advanced . <p> Joe Dearth : If you 've heard one Commonsense album , you 've heard them all . And Paine 's attitude was , well , a drag . I mean , I 'd seen his girlfriend , I knew how hot she was , but let it go ! Instead , it 's album after album of " undead bloodsucking woman ruined my life , took my soul . " Give us a break , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public likes the same old thing over and over . That 's why Gunsmoke lasted twenty years . The first album was surprising and innovative , the sort of thing now that critics love and only a few people buy , except in the sixties everyone was open to exciting new stuff . <p> But then they kept doing the same thing over and over . Their albums sold steady if not sensational , and they toured with black capes and special effects and all . So they were n't only the first goth band , like they 're called now , they were the first mass market sellouts . Well okay , not really . But I 'd seen them from the beginning , so I took it personally . <p> Audio tape , recording session , Tom Paine and Commonsense third album . You Put a Stake through My Heart . <p> Loud , messy guitar ri ff . <p> Voice of Tom Paine : Shit ! <p> Voice of Johnny Goldberg : It 's cool man , try again , you 'll get it . <p> Paine : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all shit . It 's going to be alI shit . <p> Goldberg : Not this again . Come on man , maybe you ought to take that Elavil . <p> Paine : They did it to me . <p> Goldberg : Or grass . Anyone got some grassy Shipp , you 're always holding . <p> Voice of drummer Andy Shipp : Huh ? 1 was n't listening , man . <p> Goldberg : For God 's sake , Paine . She left you . Grow up already . <p> Shipp : I need a doobie , man . Flower ? Cool . Tommy , Johnny , call us when you 're ready again . <p> Sound of door slamming . <p> Paine : You do n't understand . They were vampires . <p> Goldberg : And they took your blood and left you heartbroken . Give me a fucking break , 1 am sick of this . <p> Paine : They took my talent . <p> Goldberg : Bull . You 're incredible , man . You write , you play . Get a grip . <p> Paine : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . See , the un dead ca n't create . They ca n't dream and innovate and aspire . They can only take . So they took my dreams and my innovation . Yeah , I 'm good . But I 'm never going to get any better . It 's like I 'm frozen . <p> Goldberg : Shit , we got to get back to this song ... Look on the bright side , okay ? You 've been bit by a vampire , so you 'll live forever , right ? <p> Paint : I said to them , at least make me a vampire too . They just laughed at me . We only replace ourselves , they said . One of us world have to die first . <p> Flower : Hey you guys , come quick , There 's some reggae band out here and they ie beating up Andy . <p> Guiseppi Scapellini : Even now , in the days of holograms and digital sound and computer effects , nothing can equal the final show of Commonsense for sheer kitsch bravura and bad taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious special effects , a sort of Gotterdammerung Meets Dracula . <p> The film is , I believe , a favorite with Beavis and Butthead . <p> Film : Tom Paine 's Commonsense , The Farewell Tour . The stage set is an expressionistic castle out of the first Universal Frankenstein . Bats swoop and soar randomly overhead , manipulated by stagehands . <p> Dry ice periodically fogs the stage . <p> Paine is dressed in black leather pants and boots , with a lace-fronted shirt that he rips off early in the performance . He struts back and forth , thrusting with guitar and pelvis . The other bandmembers are in black also , Flower in a seductive slinky gown , Goldberg in a suit that largely makes him invisible . <p> " Drink my blood , take my life , <p> I 'll give it all to the vampire 's wife . Of <p> Johnny Goldberg : They were there . In the audience . I saw them , and pointed them out to Paine . I could n't believe it . He sends some roadies to bring them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " Hey , these guys were with our band before we made it . " He 's drunk or stoned or something , we all were . He just was n't holding it as well anymore . Everyone cheers . They were all drunk or stoned or contact high ; they would have cheered if he 'd announced the end of civilization . <p> So Paine kisses Sage . Gage , ever the gentleman to appearances , he walks over to Flower and kisses her hand . <p> " Let 's have them sit in for a number , shall we ? " Paine shouts , and of course the audience shouts back yeah . <p> " Paine , I do n't think that 's a good idea , man , " I say . But he grabs my guitar and hands it to Gage , and Sage takes over from Shipp at the drums . " Crossroads , " Paine says , and they do it . It was incredible . <p> Film , final concert : The tall gray man plays guitar like a dream . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toms . Flower stares down at her bass , as if afraid to move . Paine clutches the microphone with both hands and bellows the lyrics , then points to the guitarist to solo . <p> The man bends over his instrument , concentrating . Paine stalks back and forth , swinging the microphone , in a Who tribute perhaps , then throws it down in a haze of feedback and pulls off his guitar . In another burst of meaningless sound he smashes the guitar onto the stage . The body separates from the neck . <p> The crowd goes wild . The solo continues , unmindful . The woman at the drums , though , looks suddenly frightened . She rises , and Andy Shipp slides back in with barely a missed beat . <p> Paine stands , arms raised to the ceiling , Fender neck in his hand , strings dangling . Then he turns , and lunges at the guitarist . <p> The dark-haired woman flings herself between them . The wooden guitar neck seems to enter her between her breasts , to stake her . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 's gone . <p> Paine slumps onto his knees . <p> The tall man flings down his own guitar and screams . Then , eerily , he rises off the stage and hovers , staring intently . <p> The man floats back down . He grasps Paine by the hair and hisses something at him . Then he reaches out one hand toward the bass player . <p> As in a dream , Flower goes to him , and they leave . <p> Paine rolls onto his back , pounding the stage with both hands , and screams . And screams until it fades to black . <p> Joe Dearth : A classic . I just do n't get it . <p> Johnny Goldberg : We canceled the rest of the tour , never got together again . I tried to be there for Paine , but we 'd burned a lot of bridges over the years . You ca n't stay best friends forever , especially when you 're always expected to be the quiet supportive guy in the background and do n't get anything in return . Paine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything , with the help of his entourage and the groupies , had every form of VD known to God and man and was losing his liver . He wound up staying in Shipp 's basement . <p> Andy Shipp : I 'd been sending lots of money to my big brother , who wanted a shoe store of all things , and it went national chain so I was comfortable . I moved to Santa Barbara and learned how to surf and got married to this girl who was like into pots . No , she was a potter . You know , ceramics ? <p> So one day in ' 76 Tommy shows up and he 's dead broke and strung out . I let him stay . Then one day when I 'm on the beach , he makes a pass at my wife and I punched him out . I guess I feel bad about it . Beat myself up over it . It was only a few weeks later he was found floating at the bottom of the pool , needle still in his arm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know ? <p> Johnny Goldberg : I went into seclusion in a commune in Sonoma , the Russian River , for a while , until I realized everyone there was leaching off my fame and money , so I moved to this cabin in Alaska . After a couple years I decided it was time to get back to civilization , plumbing and electricity and all . An old friend from Berkeley turned me on to the Macintosh 128 , and we started messing around with it and now we have this business where we design software for musicians and artists and stuff . Animators , mostly . Every time you see a dinosaur wink , that 's my algorithm . Not blinking , that 's someone else . <p> Algorithm and blues , that 's going to be my epitaph . Except I only listen to classical now . Except Mozart . Mozart , man , he reminds me too much of Paine . <p> I married this Eskimo girl I 'd sent through Juilliard , and we 're on our way to having a string quartet . My mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about stuff like , is whale blubber kosher ? <p> Joe Dearth : In a way , I 'm glad it ended as it did . There 's nothing sadder than all these almost elderly rock stars going on tour , flashing their sexagenarian pets and strutting around like they 're still cool . At least Commonsense had a good ending . It died before it got old . <p> Johnny Goldberg : Weirdest thing . I thought I 'd go down this year to the cemetery and watch all the dorky fans put flowers on his grave . No , honey , I was n't trying to see if I had any groupies left . <p> It was so weird . There was this blond girl there , they were interviewing her for TV . She looked just like Flower , man . Like she had n't aged a day . <p> I wanted to go talk to her , but my wife 's the jealous sort . And you do n't want a jealous Eskimo on your hands , right , honey ? <p> IMG     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
