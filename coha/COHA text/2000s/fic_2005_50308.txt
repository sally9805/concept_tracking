When last we saw Harry Challenge , back in out May 2003 issue , we mentioned that Mr. Goulart was at work on his Comic Book Encyclopedia . That book has now been published , as you already know if you read Charles de Lint 's column in this issue . But did you know that Mr. Goulart 's book on the adventure comic strips , The Adventurous Decade , is being reissued soon ? And we 'd be remiss if we neglected to mention that Mr. Goulart 's latest mystery novel , Groucho Marx , King of the Jungle , is slated for publication this July . But enough about Groucho already-we want Harry . And here he is , investigating another gaslit supernatural mystery . <p> THE PORTLY MAGICIAN , frowning , abruptly stopped talking . Leaving the rigid blonde young woman in the flowing white gown floating just five feet above the stage , he hurried over to the gas-lit footlights . Pointing up at a shadowy box seat with his ivory-tipped wand , the Great Lorenzo shouted , " Harry , my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain to see me after the show . " He adjusted his top hat and returned to the floating lady . " As I was saying , " he resumed , " I acquired the power of levitation well over a decade ago while studying with certain obscure holy men in a remote and especially mystical region of far-off India . Now , my dear , be so kind as to continue your heavenward journey . " The magician made a few circular motions with the wand . The robust blonde rose , slowly , upward until she achieved an altitude of about ten feet . There was a large flash of yellow lightning and she vanished entirely . The Great Lorenzo 's crimson-lined cape swirled outward as he bowed toward the audience in the London theater . As he straightened up , smiling broadly , the several hundred enthusiastic patrons applauded . Harry Challenge skirted the huge gilded cabinet that Lorenzo used in his Famous Oriental Escape Illusion and made his way through the backstage area toward the door of his friend 's dressing room . He was a lean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height . He wore , since his father felt it helped the image of their agency , a conservative dark business suit and a bowler hat . He also wore a shoulder holster containing a .38 revolver . Harry was an American private inquiry agent who now and then handled an occult case . It was late in May of 1899 and he was spending a few days in London prior to heading to Ruritania to consult with a client who suspected that his recently inherited castle contained a ghost . The star attached to Lorenzo 's door was large and lopsided , looking as though it had been cut out of a sheet of yellow wrapping paper and glued there . Someone had penciled the word Great over the typed name Lorenzo on the small name card . " Come in , Harry , " called the magician after Harry knocked . He entered , grinning . " You 've changed the act , " he said , settling into the listing Morris chair . " Yelling at me is n't usually part of it . " The heavyset man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , making certain he 'd removed every trace of stage makeup . " That was an authentic warning , my boy , not a diversion for my adoring audience . " " You knew I 'd drop in after the show , " Harry reminded , taking one of his thin cigars out of his case . " There was no need to - " " As you are aware , Harry , I am , pure and simple , an illusionist , " Lorenzo told him as he turned his chair to sit facing him . " However , now and then I am visited with what I deem a true premonition , a vision of what 's to come . Some of them have in the past , as you may recall , helped you to avoid serious trouble . " " Yep , that 's true , " agreed Harry , lighting his cigar with a wax match . " So I take it you 've had another glimpse into my possible future ? " The magician fluffed his ample sideburns , nodding . " Exactly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Is n't her name Delphine ? " " This is an entirely different blonde , Harry , and one that is a good " fifteen pounds heavier than the departed Delphine . " " It 's a good thing , then , that you learned levitation in India , " observed Harry , exhaling smoke . " What sort of premonition about me did you have ? " The Great Lorenzo sighed . " Just as I was about to send Olivia onward and upward , I experienced severe pains in my chest and stomach , " he explained . " A sure sign of either indigestion or an oncoming vision . seconds later , I beheld a very clear and sharp picture of you . I was exceedingly disturbed , because .... " " Because what ? " In a lowered voice Lorenzo answered , " You were dead . " Harry leaned forward . " Details ? " " As you know , Harry , some of my peeks into tomorrow are partially symbolic , " he said . " At any rate , my boy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Egyptian mummy case . There were several Egyptian artifacts in the background , and plunged into your heart was a wicked-looking dagger with a great golden beetle engraved on its hilt . " Harry took a thoughtful puff of his stogie . " That 's it ? " The Great Lorenzo nodded . " I was so unnerved that I interrupted my act to warn you at once . " " So what exactly should I be avoiding , Lorenzo ? Trips to Egypt ? Sleeping in mummy cases ? What ? " Frowning , the plump magician answered , " Surely you 're working on a case here in London ? Something involving Egyptology perhaps . It occurred to me that you were investigating what the newspapers have been referring to as The Curse of King Ibis the second 's Tomb . ' " " Yellow journalism . " " Two of the men who opened the tomb in the Valley of the Jackals in 1896 have been murdered and robbed within the past three weeks , " amplified the magician . " You were n't hired to investigate this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you 've had considerable experience - " " I am simply spending a few days in London before I catch a boat train and then sail to Ruritania , " said Harry , grinning . " Fellow who inherited a castle near Zenda suspects he may be haunted . " The magician 's frown deepened . " This is most odd , Harry , since I seldom get all the details wrong in one of my .... Ah , perhaps this is it . " He nodded at the closed door to his dressing room . Someone knocked politely . " Come in , my dear , " he invited . The erstwhile floating blonde , wearing a checked flannel robe , entered . There was a cablegram envelope in her hand . " This was just delivered at the stage door for Mr. Challenge . Good evening , Mr. Challenge , I 'm Olivia Claybrook . " He accepted the cablegram . " Thanks , Miss claybrook . " She glanced at the magician . " Are we still having a late supper , Lorenzo ? " " Quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved to the doorway . " I was most pleased to meet you , Mr. Challenge , " she said and exited . Harry opened the message . It read : DEAR SON : INSTEAD OF STAGGERING AROUND LONDON WITH THAT DISSOLUTE MAGICIAN , GET TO WORK . SlR LlONEL DANVERS WANTS YOU TO INVESTIGATE A POSSIBLE CURSE . See HIM TONIGHT AT 11 P.M. AT THE LONDON MUSEUM OF EGYPTOLOGY . HE 'S FILTHY RICH AND THIS MEANS A LARGE FEE FOR THE AGENCY . YOUR LOVING FATHER , THE CHALLENGE INTERNATIONAL DETECTIVE AGENCY . Taking a couple puffs on his cigar , Harry handed the cablegram to the magician . After reading it , Lorenzo said , " Ah , as I foretold , Egyptian trappings . Are you going to accept the case ? " " Sure . " " I 'd accompany you to the museum , since it 's only a short walk from Piccadilly Circus here , " he said apologetically , " but , as you know , I promised to dine with the fair Olivia . Later in the evening , I tentatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's okay , Lorenzo . " Harry consulted his pocket watch , then stood up . " Now that I 'm forewarned , I wo n't get into any mummy cases or let anyone get near me with a golden dagger . " The magician rose up . " I 'm serious , Harry , " he said . " You must be very careful . " " That 's one of my policies , " Harry assured his friend . They did n't have daggers . The three large hooded men who came charging out of the thick night fog were armed with cluhs . Harry judged he was less than a half block from the London Museum of Egyptology when the figures materialized from out of the chill mist . " Stay away from the bloody museum , Challenge , " suggested the first lout as he swung his gnarled cudgel at Harry 's head . Dodging the blow , Harry dived to his left . His shoulder slammed hard ; against a high wrought-iron fence that blossomed out of the gray fog . The impact knocked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward him , brandishing a stout bludgeon . Yanking his pistol out , Harry fired at the wide man . The slug hit the man in the thigh . He howled , causing his dark silken hood to billow out . He went stumbling backward and was swallowed by the fog . Standing wide-legged and alert , revolver in hand , Harry watched the surrounding mist . He could n't spot either of the other two thugs . Then suddenly a rough scarf was jerked around his neck from behind . As it tightened , he began to choke , making harsh hacking sounds in his throat . Harry tried to fire his gun back over his shoulder to hit the strangler . But then a club came swinging out of the mist to swat his gun hand . The .38 fell to the pavement . He did n't seem to be able to take in any air at all , was growing dizzy , started seeing zigzag bursts of fuzzy-colored light in the thick night fog . " That 's quite enough of that , you rowdies , " commanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pistol shots followed . Harry heard someone cry , " You 'll regret this , Zuleika . " He passed out . As Harry gradually returned to awareness , he had the initial impression that a baboon was chastising him . In critical , and somewhat nasal , tones , the three-foot high creature was saying , " ... highly , one might say extremely , disappointed in the manner of your advent , Challenge . I mean to say , one of our guards noticed you staggering up the steps of the museum in a state that can only be classified as extreme drunkenness . No sooner had he admitted you than you passed out completely , nearly damaging an exhibit case of rare polychrome unguent vessels . Your conduct thus far , I need hardly point out , fails to add anything in the way of luster to the reputation of the Challenge International Detective Agency . " " Whoa now , " said Harry in a fuzzy , croaking voice . He coughed twice , tried again to speak . " I 'm not drunk . I always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vision had been clearing and he was now able to discern that the baboon was a life-size quartzite statue resting atop a refectory table near the armchair in which he had awakened . " A rather feeble explanation , " remarked the small almost bald man behind the desk facing Harry . He was pale and thin , about sixty years of age , wearing a rumpled Norfolk jacket . " I am relying on you , after all , to investigate a most puzzling case , involving as it does murder and the possibility that an ancient Egyptian curse is being fulfilled . If you 're not up to remaining in control of your faculties , Challenge , perhaps the museum had best contact the Pinkerton agency or perhaps Burns or some other - " " C'm on , Professor Danvers , " cut in Harry , " you know damned well that Pinkerton or Burns ca n't tackle anything that smacks of the supernatural . In fact , Burns would hide under his desk if anybody so much as mentioned an Egyptian curse to him . " By pushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got , wobbling some , to his feet . " However , if you 're going to be a stubborn , pigheaded - " " Sit down , old man , " suggested Danvers . " Perhaps I 've been a bit offensive . It is , I am told , an unfortunate habit of mine . I 'm well aware of the excellent reputation of your father 's detective agency in matters of this - " " We 're equal partners , " corrected Harry , settling back into the chair . " Of course , forgive me . " Leaving his chair , Danvers moved toward a small claw-footed table that held a bottle of wine and four glasses . " Might I offer you a glass of sherry ? I find it helps clear one 's head after any - " " Nope . " The professor 's office was large , lit by two hanging lamps and shadowy around the edges . It was oak-paneled and rich with wall cases that held Egyptian artifacts such as alabaster chalices , gold amulets , pendants of gold and turquoise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall was a gold-overlaid wooden coffin lid taken from a tomb . After Professor Danvers poured himself a glass of sherry , he returned to his desk . " Now to the business at hand , " he said after sipping his wine . " It involves a curse ? " " That I am not altogether certain of , old man , " said the Egyptologist . " Which is one reason why I sought the help of the Challenge International Detective Agency . As you may be aware , I was one of those leading an expedition to Egypt four years ago . " " I 'm aware of that , yeah , " said Harry . " You and your colleagues discovered the tomb of King Ibis the Second in the Valley of the Jackals . There was supposedly a curse that threatened anyone who defiled the tomb . " Danvers nodded . " That 's a common factor associated with such excavations , " he said . " We thought little or nothing of it at the time . However , just a month ago , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed in a most gruesome manner . That was poor Sir Rodlow Coddington , who was found brutally stabbed in his town house in Bloomsbury - quite near to our museum . The motive , Scotland Yard decided , was burglary , since quite a few valuable pieces from the tomb of Ibis the second were stolen . " " How come Sir Rodlow had stuff like that around the house ? " asked Harry . " Were n't you fellows obliged to turn everything over to the museum here , since they financed the excavation ? " " We had a special agreement , which allowed all six of us to split up a small percentage of the findings . " " Was there something specific in what he had that burglars might 've been after ? Or were they simply gathering loot ? " Danvers hesitated , sipped his sherry . Shaking his head , he answered , " No specific item , to the best of my knowledge . " " Sir Rodlow is n't the only one of the six who 's died , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Only two weeks since Malcolm Tubridy , at seventy-four the oldest of our group , was bludgeoned to death at his country estate in Somerset near the village of Dowlish Wake . Again mostly artifacts from the tomb of Ibis the second were stolen . " " What 's Scotland Yard say about the second killing ? " " They believe , in both instances , that they 're dealing with a gang of art thieves , Challenge , " he answered . " As you may know , some of the more sensation-minded London newspapers have already suggested that the curse is to blame for the two deaths thus far . For myself , I am not at all certain . " He stood up again . " I would , I assure you , very much like to prevent further deaths - whatever their cause . " Harry took out his cigar case , extracted one of the thin cigars he favored but did not light it . " I want names of the remaining members of your party and their addresses . " From beneath an alabaster vase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here are the three others besides myself . " " All of them reside in or near London , " said Challenge after studying the list . " Does Scotland Yard have men watching all of you ? " The professor replied , " They have not taken me into their confidence , Challenge . Nor am I certain that they believe that the rest of us are in danger . " " I 'll talk to somebody I know at Scotland Yard and see what precautions they 're taking , " said the detective . " I can contact a local agency we work with and have them keep an eye on you fellows if need be . " He opened the cigar case again , put the stogie away . " You do n't actually believe there 's a curse , do you ? " " Frankly , I do not completely accept the notion , " admitted Professor Danvers . " Still , I 'd like someone with your occult experience to make absolutely certain . " " Outside of theft , what other reason can you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , Challenge , " said Danvers . " That 's why I 'm paying the Challenge agency a nearly outrageous fee to find out exactly what 's afoot here . " Harry folded the list of names twice , slipped it into the breast pocket of his coat . " Do you know anyone named Zuleika ? " Danvers frowned , eyes narrowing . " My wife , sir , happens to be named Zuleika . " " No , I was thinking of a younger woman who might - " " My second wife is considerably younger than I am , " he said evenly . " Why , may I ask , are you - " " Nothing important . " He stood up . " Who did you tell you were hiring me ? " " Only my colleagues from the expedition . " " Not your wife ? " " Certainly , since I believe in sharing my concerns with my wife . Are you implying that - " " I 'm implying that somebody knew I was coming to call on you tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . " Somebody - who apparently wanted to discourage me from working on this case . " " Yes , that had n't occurred to me earlier , " he admitted . " I am , alas , at a loss to account for it . " " That 's one more thing I 'll have to find out . " Harry grinned , very briefly , and took his leave of the professor and the museum . THE LARGE POISONOUS SNAKE had apparently grown restless . It came slithering out from under the four-poster canopy bed just after Harry tugged on his night shirt . It did n't wait until he was in bed and asleep to attempt an attack . Executing what was , considering the circumstances and the amount of massive furniture crowded into his second floor hotel room , a very graceful back flip , Harry put a greater distance between himself and the serpent . From atop the heavy mahogany bureau he grabbed his .38 revolver and , half-turning , fired at the snake . He missed and , producing an annoyed hiss , the reptile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Harry urged himself , firing again . This time he successfully decapitated the snake . " I say , " shouted the tenant of the room next to his , " it 's a bit late for that sort of thing , do n't you think , old man ? " Shrugging , Harry kept his pistol gripped in his hand and approached the remnants of the snake . " Looks like an imported viper , " he decided . " That indicates that somebody resourceful has taken an interest in doing me in . " He was contemplating the dead creature when the balcony window snapped open , the heavy brocaded drapes flapped and fog came spilling in from the chill night outside . Harry pivoted , his revolver aimed at the window . " I have reason to believe , Mr. Challenge , " announced the handsome young woman who stepped in off the balcony , " that another attempt will be made on your life this evening . " " In addition to the snake ? " She glanced down in the direction he was pointing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the snake I was anticipating , " she said . " If my hansom cab had n't been overturned after a collision with a beer wagon , I 'd have been here a good quarter of an hour ago . " She nodded her approval . " You 're apparently more competent than I had reason to believe . " Harry refrained from mentioning that it had taken him two shots to dispatch the damned snake . After returning the gun to the bureau top , he put on a robe . " Why exactly are you trying to be my bodyguard , Mrs. Danvers ? " She pursed her lips . " So you 're aware of my identity . I suppose , " said Zuleika Danvers , " that 's because you 're a detective . " Harry seated himself in one of the bedroom 's several fat Morris chairs . " I heard your voice when you shot at that trio of louts near the museum , " he told her . " I heard those would-be assassins call you Zuleika and later your husband mentioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Zuleika was a tall handsome woman in her late twenties . Blonde , with a Burne-Jones look , she was wearing riding breeches , boots , and a heavy mariner 's sweater . " That 's another reason why I wished to talk to you , " she said , sitting down on a candy-striped love seat . Finding a thin cheroot in the pocket of his robe , Harry lit it . " You know more than your husband does about these murders , " he suggested , exhaling smoke . " You ought not to smoke , Mr. Challenge , " said Zuleika . " Not only is it an offensive habit , but it undoubtedly affects your health . " He ground out his cigar in a stoneware ashtray . " The murders ? " The handsome young woman looked directly at him , her hazel eyes bright . " My husband is a highly intelligent man , much respected in the field of Egyptology , " she began . " He is also , regrettably , nearly sixty years of age and far from his prime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger fellow ? " Lowering her head , Zuleika sighed . " I fear that it does , " she admitted . " Although I was not aware of it when I began the affair , he is one of the most dangerous men in London . I would list him third , close on the heels of Professor Moriarty and then Dr. Grimshaw , in the ranks of criminal masterminds . Once I learned his true nature , I severed the relationship . " " His name ? " In a lowered voice she answered , " Ambrose Winward , who passes himself off as a decadent illustrator in the manner of Aubrey Beardsley . In actuality he is a practitioner of the black arts as well as a thief and a murderer . " " And you did n't know this when you took up with the guy ? " " Alas , no . Have you heard of him ? " " Rumors only , " answered Harry . " He heads a secret organization called the Brotherhood of Anubis , an outfit that mixes worship of assorted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crimes . The law has n't been able to bring Winward to book as yet . " " Ambrose is cunning as well as , I must admit , charming . " " Okay , so what has this got to do with the attacks on your husband 's cronies ? " Standing , the booted young woman began , as best she could in the cluttered bed chamber , to pace . " When Ambrose and I were still meeting secretly - all that ended nearly two months ago - he asked me to tell him many details of the King Ibis the second expedition , which the professor had outlined to me in great and sometimes tedious detail . " She paused , resting a hand on the back of Harry 's fat chair . " Ambrose was very much interested in that expedition to the Valley of the Jackals . He was also gratified to hear that the six leaders of the excavation had kept some of the loot for themselves . " " Loot in general or something specific ? " She replied , " Ambrose was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious about a half dozen scarabs , each made of green jasper and set in gold . " " Why ? " " He never specified the reason for his keen interest in them , Mr. Challenge . " " Who ended up in possession of the scarabs ? " " Each of the six leaders took one . " She returned to the love seat . " I am very much afraid that Ambrose Winward is determined to possess all six of those Egyptian scarabs . " " Or maybe he only wants one and does n't know which fellow has it , " he said , leaning forward in his chair . " Now explain how come you knew three thugs were going to jump me . " She folded her hands in her lap , sighing again . " I met a disgruntled member of his Brotherhood of Anubis at a literary salon near Russell Square this afternoon and he revealed their plans to me , knowing that my husband had hired you . " " Who exactly were those unsuccessful assassins ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you - at least not until you shot one of them , " said Zuleika . " All three are members of a group that Ambrose uses to do his dirty work and unpleasant chores . They call themselves the Limehouse Assassins . " " Any bunch that give themselves a name like that probably meant me no good from the start , " he told her . " How come one of them knew your name ? " " I met some of them , in their unmasked state , while attending some of Ambrose 's rather decadent parties at his London townhouse , " she said . " I 'm not certain which one it was who recognized me . " " What 's the name of the disgruntled fellow who tipped you off ? " " That will do you no good , since he was planning to take the boat train earlier this evening and is probably on his way to Calais by now . " Harry rose up off his chair . " Looks as though I 'll have to gather up the rest of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to swiping the damn things . " " You must be very careful , " she warned . " He 's an extremely dangerous man . " " So am I , " Harry assured her . Harry looked up from his breakfast coffee when a large cloud of pale green smoke rose up and engulfed the empty chair across the marble table from him . This unexpected manifestation caused considerable murmuring , and some complaining , among the other guests enjoying breakfast at the surrounding tables in the hotel 's dome-lit restaurant . " Good morning , Lorenzo , " said Harry , returning his attention to his cup of coffee . As the smoke dissipated the portly form of the Great Lorenzo , clad in a nubby tweed suit and a deerstalker cap , could be discerned standing beside the chair . The magician bowed to his left , then to his right . " The Great Lorenzo , appearing nightly at the Crown Royale Theatre , " he announced , fluffing his side whiskers . " Credited by all astute critics of the day as being the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stages in England and the Continent . Tickets still available for all of the remaining dozen performances . " He sat down . " Deuced bad taste , " muttered the white-mustached , decidedly military old gentleman at a nearby table . " Good morning , my boy . " Lorenzo plucked a scone from the silver serving dish . He gestured and a thick dab of marmalade appeared upon it . " You caused me a rather sleepless night . " Picking up his fork , Harry turned his attention to the kipper upon his plate . " Another vision ? " The magician nodded . " I saw you trapped within an ancient pyramid , " he explained between bites of scone . " A large horde of voracious greenish beetles were making a meal of you . " " Scarabs , huh ? " Harry , thoughtfully , set his fork aside . " What else did you see ? " " As I 've often stated , Harry , I make no claims as to the authenticity of my visions . " He wiped a scatter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next favored with the image of a longtime London acquaintance of mine , the illustrious Madame Tandofsky . " " That fat lady who 's been working the fake spiritualist dodge over in a flat near the Embankment ? " " Rebecca Tandofsky is a very respectable charlatan , " the magician said in her defense . " The point of this particular premonition is , I truly conclude , that she is also an extremely erudite scholar of the occult arts . " " So ? " " As I tossed and turned in my bed - or rather the bed of a by-this-time moderately annoyed duchess - as I tossed and turned , a voice spoke to me . " " The duchess 's husband ? " His narrowed left eye and scornful expression indicated what Lorenzo thought of Harry 's remark . " This voice told me , quite distinctly , " Madame Tandofsky can reveal to Harry Challenge the secret of the scarab . ' " He leaned back in his chair , smiling . " Am I correct in imagining that this mysterious nocturnal message from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your hunches have been helpful in the past , " he said . " Including the stuff about assassins last night . " " Ah , I was wondering about that . Tell me what - " " Eventually , " promised Harry . " First , though , yeah , I am interested in a bunch of scarabs . They tie in with this new case . " The Great Lorenzo smiled again . " Judging that such might well be the case , my boy , I telephoned Rebecca and arranged for us to call on the gifted lady at one o'clock this very day , " he informed Harry . " Does that meet with your approval ? " " It does , " Harry said . " I am very fond , " said Madame Tandofsky , " of owls . " " So I suspected . " Harry seated himself in one of the bentwood chairs in the medium 's jasmine-scented parlor . Atop the dark wood bookcases that covered two of the shadowy room 's walls sat eleven owls . At least ten of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after patting the heavyset Madame Tandofsky fondly on the shoulder , settled onto a purple ottoman . " You are looking , Rebecca , as fetching as usual . " " I 've gained another three stone since last we met , Renzo , " she said . " But then , there are those who find fat ladies fetching . " She weighed close to two hundred and fifty pounds and was wearing a voluminous , shapeless gown of dark velvet along with a rather dusty headdress composed of bedraggled peacock feathers and one yellowed ostrich plume . " True , you 're not exactly svelte , dear lady , and yet - " " Since you 're Renzo 's friend , Challenge , I 'll only charge you double my usual fee . " The padded rocker she filled creaked and quivered when she turned toward Harry . " She usually charges three times her mediumistic fee for occult research , " explained the magician . " Two guineas . " She extended a pudgy palm toward Harry . Fishing coins out of his vest pocket , he leaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What can you tell me about the six scarabs found in the tomb of - " " The sacred scarabs of King Ibis the second , ah yes . " She held out her other hand . " Renzo , my dear . " Rising from the ottoman , the magician helped the large medium get to her feet . " At your service , dear lady . " Waddling slightly , the hem of her dark gown brushing at the faded Persian carpet , she made her way to one of the bookcases . " Are you still feeling peaked , Oskar ? " The third owl from the left made a raspy hooting noise , fluttering his wings . " Oskar , I fear , is suffering from the pip . " Madame Tandofsky , grunting some , tugged a thick , leather-bound book from a shelf , sending motes of dust spinning . The owl sneezed . Wheezing a bit , the medium returned to her rocker and set the book on the wobbly table in front of her . " This is the infamous suppressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sorcery &; How to Apply It to Great Advantage Without the Risk of Eternal Damnation . All save three copies of the first edition were burned over two centuries ago at the order of the then-Pope . " When Madame Tandofsky patted the book , dust rose up from its cover . " For untold centuries , long , long before the sacred resting place of Ibis the second was defiled , it was known among certain adepts that one of the half dozen carved beetles buried with him was the key to a significant mystical secret . This scarab came to be known in sorcery circles as the Blazing Scarab and it is said to bestow the gift of eternal life on whomsoever uses it in the proper manner . " Harry was skeptical . " Why did n't Ibis the second use it for himself ? " " He already believed he was going on to glory , to the Egyptian equivalent thereof , " she answered . " If , as dear Renzo informed me , that black-hearted scoundrel Ambrose Winward is gathering together the scarabs , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the fabled Blazing Scarab . " " Why 's it called blazing ? " She grunted again in opening the book of sorcery . Finding the page she sought , wheezing more pronouncedly , Madame Tandof sky poked a pudgy finger at the paragraph on the foxed page . " When the proper scarab of the six is inserted into a certain spot upon the lid of the sarcophagus of King Ibis the second , it will glow with an intense crimson flame . That 's according to the nefarious Count Monstrodamus , who , keep in mind , Challenge , had nothing in the way of firsthand knowledge in this matter . After the scarab flares crimson , a secret compartment in the lid will slide open to reveal a parchment upon which will be found the secret of eternal life . " Rubbing his hands together , Lorenzo observed , " Perhaps I can incorporate something like this into an amazing illusion . " For the first time on any stage in the entire world , the Blazing Scarab Illusion , which - ' " " Is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell which scarab is the right one ? " She shook her head . " Only by placing it in this proper slot , " she replied , pointing to a wood engraving on the page of the ancient book . " They are otherwise identical and that is why Winward is gathering up the entire half dozen of the things . " Getting up from his chair , Harry studied the drawing . " I intend to gather the rest of them ahead of Winward . " She gave him a sympathetic glance . " Opposing him will be very dangerous , young man , " she warned . " Even so , " he said . Things went fairly smoothly until Harry arrived to collect the fourth and last of the remaining scarabs . It was the evening of the day of his illuminating visit to Madame Tandofsky . Rain was falling heavily as the hansom cab dropped him off in front of the three-story stone house in the small square off Euston Road . He went sprinting across the sidewalk toward the wrought-iron gate that guarded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his left wrist was a venerable attach case holding the three other scarabs that he had , with the help of letters and phone calls from Professor Danvers , already gathered up today . The black gate hung partially open , creaking slightly as the rain-laden wind brushed at it . Slowing , Harry approached the front steps more cautiously . The heavy carved oaken door was partially open . The pale gaslight from the wall lamps in the corridor beyond spilled out to illuminate a constable 's helmet that had fallen on its side atop the worn welcome mat . Sliding his .38 from his shoulder holster , Harry moved carefully up the wide brick steps . Above the sound of the heavy night rain hitting on the gabled roofs of Sir Nigel 's house , Harry became aware of a low moaning . When he reached the topmost step , he stood listening . He heard another , weaker , moan from within the house . He booted the door open , then pressed back against the porch wall . Harry allowed nearly a half minute to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Blotching the sylvan carpet designs were several fresh muddy footprints . They led along the empty corridor toward the open door of the darkpaneled study . Inside the gas-lit room , sprawled on the thick carpet , was the body of a gaunt man . He was face down , in his fifties , bald , wearing a silk smoking jacket . This was , judging by the description he 'd been given by his client , the body of Sir Nigel Marshwood . There were two exit wounds in his back and he 'd apparently died while Harry was making his way along the hall . Books had been swept from shelves . A large glass case , its top smashed , lay on its side near the corpse of the Egyptologist . Straightening up after kneeling beside the remains of Sir Nigel , Harry said aloud , " Looks like they got themselves another scarab . But at least I have three of the damned things . " " Not for long , old chap , " observed the hooded man who appeared in the study doorway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I presume . " The thickset man gestured with the Luger in his gloved left hand . " Drop your gun down beside the dear departed , Challenge , and back up against the bookcase , if you please . " Harry did n't comply . Instead , he dived suddenly toward the right , the attached attach case flipping out to knock a three-foot high alabaster statue of Osiris off its stand . Harry fired at the hooded assassin while he was midway between his upright position and the floor . His slug caught the man in the left arm . The man 's gloved fingers went splaying out . The Luger dropped , hitting the fallen display case and shattering more of its glass panels . Harry rose , his gun aimed at the wounded man . " Looks like my collection of scarabs , " he said , " is going to grow by one more . " " I do n't believe , " said Sir Lionel Danvers , " that you 've met my wife , Challenge . " " I have n't , nope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrist . He set it upon a workbench in the center of the large , lofty work room of the London Museum of Egyptology . " A pleasure , Lady Danvers . " Wearing an opened dark cloak over an off-white and low-cut evening gown , the young woman was standing beside the ornate quartzite sarcophagus of King Ibis II that rested on a sturdy pine pallet . " It 's a pity , " she said , " that you were n't able to gather together the entire six scarabs , Mr. Challenge . " Danvers cleared his throat . " I took the liberty , " he said , " of telling Zuleika your theory that one of the half dozen scarabs we found in the tomb might be the allegedly magical Blazing Scarab . " Opening the attach case , Harry extracted the chamois pouch that contained the four scarabs he 'd spent the day collecting . " If we 're lucky , one of these may be the right one , " he said . " And it 's not my theory , but that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently believe in the notion or they would n't have been after the scarabs . " " You have no idea , " asked the professor , " who 's been murdering my colleagues and committing the thefts ? " Harry shook the scarabs out of the bag into his hand . " Some notions , but no proof as yet , " he answered . " But the Limehouse Assassin I caught at Sir Nigel 's may eventually provide an answer . He 's being detained by Scotland Yard at the moment , though not yet in a talkative mood . " " Dreadful that poor Nigel was also murdered , " said Danvers , sighing . " Bit of a bore , but otherwise a very decent chap . " " The assassin slugged the constable who was keeping an eye on the place , trussed him up and tossed him in the shrubbery , " said Harry , approaching the sarcophagus with the quartet of beetles clutched in his fist . " We found the butler in a similar state in the parlor and I found the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cheap watch . " " So much death , " said Zuleika quietly , backing away from the sarcophagus . " It causes one to believe there may well have been a curse in effect . " She stopped in the shadows near two upright wooden mummy cases that were propped against the buff-colored wall . Engraved on the lid of the sarcophagus were two hawks , facing each other , beaks almost touching . Between the tips of the beaks was a concavity the size of a scarab . " According to the engraving in the count 's account , " explained Harry , " this is where the Blazing Scarab has to be inserted in order to do its job . " " On with it , young man , try them out , " urged Professor Danvers , moving closer to him . Selecting one , Harry fit it in the depression . Nothing happened . After waiting a full minute , he pried it free and auditioned a second green jasper beetle . Again nothing happened . " Perhaps , " commented Danvers , " this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Harry tested the third scarab . The heavy sarcophagus lid produced a faint grating sound . Then , dimly at the outset , the scarab began to glow . It turned from green to red , flaring more brightly . " Jove , the Blazing Scarab , " exclaimed Professor Danvers in an awed whisper . The sarcophagus rattled , made a chattering noise , and then a small ornamental panel , also inscribed with two hawks , popped open . " That 's it . " Harry reached toward the emerging compartment . " This , I very much fear , is going to be awfully frustrating for you , Challenge . But then , anticipation is often much more pleasing than gratification . " One of the gilded mummy cases had swung open with a whining creak and a tall , pale , moderately overweight man of about forty , built roughly along the lines of Oscar Wilde , stepped into the workshop . He held an ornately filigreed dueling pistol grasped in his hand . " It 's Winward , " gasped Zuleika , bringing her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow who 's been gathering scarabs , " said Harry , his hand poised near the compartment . " I 've read of him . " Danvers scowled at the intruder . " He 's a wastrel and a decadent reprobate . " " Yes , the newspapers do tend to flatter me . " Winward waved Harry back from the sarcophagus with his gun hand . " In actuality , dear professor , I am a satanic sorcerer and vicious master criminal . " " And a second-rate artist , " added Harry , backing a few paces . " That good , do you think ? " Winward 's pleased smile broadened . " Now then , Challenge , old man , if you 'll move even farther away , I 'll collect the papyrus that I 've been seeking . I must admit that I 'm rather eager to learn the secret of eternal life . " Professor Danvers asked , " You killed three men for that ? " " I 'm merely following one of the basic principles of our imperialist British diplomatic policy , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You kill a batch of your inferiors so that you yourself may thrive . " Gun aimed at Harry , Winward thrust his free hand into the open stone compartment . " Once I decipher this ancient ... damme ! " He yanked back his pale , plump hand , grimacing , shaking it violently . The tip of his forefinger was bleeding . " A poisoned needle , I 'll wager , " said the professor . Windward turned to him . " One of the few occasions when you 've ever been right about .... " He shuddered , swayed , fell against the sarcophagus and then dropped to the parquet floor where his body twitched for about ten seconds . The fallen dueling pistol had gone skittering toward Zuleika . She ran to the fallen man , cloak swirling . " Ambrose , " she said , genuflecting beside him . Kneeling next to her , Harry reached out to take hold of Winward 's wrist . " No pulse , " he said , standing up . " I 'll go to your office , professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very carefully , Danvers crouched and squinted into the compartment . " This is totally empty , " he said . " If there ever was a document inside , it was removed centuries ago and the poisoned needle installed . " " There 's probably a lesson here for us all . " Harry crossed to the doorway . As he started down the shadowy museum hallway , he heard the professor ask his wife , " How is that you addressed this scoundrel by his first name , my dear ? " <p>
