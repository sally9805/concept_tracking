Chapter One Thursday My life used to be simple . All I needed : a good book and my fluffy fleece blanket . Then everything changed with the Trinvasion . Since Trin Adams moved here and took over our lives , my best friend Harmony and I have never been the same . Sure , I 'm glad Trin talked us into being a rock band . I 'm a real drummer now . But I do n't like being out front , even though I can do it . Thankfully , I wo n't have to worry about that for a while . Now summer 's here , school 's over , and my only scheduled gig is going to Surf &; Sand City , where Harmony and I spend a week every year - huge cliffs overlooking the ocean , tons of cute boys , and time to read and do a whole bunch of nothing . But best of all , no band , no work , and no Trin ... * * * I had just rolled into my softest fleece throw and shuffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone rang " La Bamba . " " Harmony ? " " Hello , Mello ! " Harmony 's voice blasted out at me . " Are you packed ? " " Packing . " " I knew it . Are you ready for some serious fun-o-rama ? " " I 'm ready for some rest-o-rama , Harmony - picking out a novel as we speak . " I could practically hear her rolling her eyes . " You 've got to be the only teenager in Southern California who thinks a retreat at Surf &Sand; City is about resting , " she accused . " You can do whatever you want , " I answered . " You 'll know where to find me . " " On your favorite cliff , reading a book , " she said in her most disgusted voice . I closed my eyes and pictured it . I could almost smell the ocean and feel the breeze . " Definitely . " " I ca n't believe we leave tomorrow . One o'clock , just like last year ? " " Definitely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? " " Definitely . " " Hasta maana ! " I punched the End button on my phone . Before I even put it down , it rang again . But it was n't " La Bamba . " " Hello ? " " May I please speak to Mello McMann ? " " This is she , " I answered . " Mello , this is David Karuthers . You know that I 'm coordinating this year 's retreat . Today I 'm pulling together last-minute details at the office . Are you coming to choir practice tonight ? " he asked in his bouncy voice . " Yes , " I answered , trying to figure out what choir had to do with anything . " Do you think your friend Harmony could come with you ? And maybe you could come early ? I 'd like to speak to the two of you about the trip . " I paused before I answered . Was this about last year 's retreat ? The speaker 's shoes hot-glued to the ceiling ? Or the toothpaste on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he needed to talk to Harmony , not me . Maybe it was n't the best idea to invite her to join my youth group on this trip every year . I said , " I think so . I 'll call Harmony . " " Great . Meet me at the youth center at six thirty . " * * * " If I was going to get in trouble for that stuff , do n't you think it would have happened last year ? " Harmony whispered as we walked up the church sidewalk . I shrugged . " Maybe they found out something new . Maybe someone just now complained . How should I know ? " " So why do you have to be here ? All you did last year was read . " I threw an arm around Harmony 's shoulder . " I guess I 'm guilty by association , " I said with a groan . We found Mr. Karuthers inside the youth center . He did n't look mad at all . He smiled real wide , bounced over to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Here , girls , have a seat , " he said . " Thanks for coming . " I looked at Harmony , and she raised her eyebrows . So far , so good . " Mello , Harmony , I want this retreat to be a special time for everyone who attends . I know it 's a good time to relax , but I think it should be more than that . " Harmony shot me a look . I felt like saying , " I do n't think he 's talking about pranks and water-balloon fights . " " Last night I went down the list of students who will be attending , " he continued . " When I got to your names , I knew I had the answer I 've been looking for ! " My heart started beating out a warning . I did n't want to be anyone 's answer to anything . I wanted to hide on my cliff and read . He smiled at us and asked , " How would the Chosen Girls like to do an outreach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frijoles ! " Harmony said , probably as much from relief about not being in trouble as from excitement about the concert . I tried to process . One concert would n't be such a big deal . I would only lose one evening of downtime . But I would have to bring my drums . And Trin . It was n't what I had planned on . Mr. Karuthers talked on and on about how all the campers could pass out flyers Friday . Loads of people would come . He said the concert would be a great opportunity for people to hear the positive message our band loved to share . I started simmering inside . I do n't care if those people hear our message , Mr. Karuthers . I want to read my book , not do a concert . But I smiled and said , " Definitely , Mr. Karuthers . We 'll check with Trin , but I 'm sure she 'll say yes . Can our soundman come too ? " * * * Lamont agreed immediately , offering to help with more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Sand City . And Trin definitely said yes . Actually , she screamed , " Ohwow ! Yes ! Sweet ! I ca n't wait ! What should I pack ? " I knew Trin had been feeling left out since Harmony and I had planned to go without her . I finished packing and spent the rest of the night chatting online . Trin : ohwow - it 's right on the beach ? Harmony : s. muy bonita. bring sunscreen . Trin : sand volleyball ? Me : n surfi ng lessons , horses , mountain biking Harmony : LOL ! like mello ever did any of that b4 ! ! ! but u will luv it , trin - just wait til u c the cabins . way cute Trin : i ca n't wait . i just have 2 learn 2 surf ! Lamont : i have n't been on a board in months Me : thx for the warning - we 'll stay out of ur way Trin : how many pairs of shoes r u bringing ? Me : 2 Lamont : what does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i packed 5 Trin : i think i can make it with 8 Lamont : we 're only there a week . why do u need 8 pairs of shoes ? Trin : did n't some1 tell u 2 b quiet ? I could see Harmony was psyched about Trin 's going . Now she 'd have someone to hang with . I should have been happy for her , since I just wanted to kick back . But instead I felt irritated . * * * Friday Morning Friday morning we met early at the shed behind my house . Harmony and I had used the shed as a playhouse for years , but now it serves as a studio . We needed to run through the songs and make sure we were all cool with the plan . Lamont joined us , since he lives right next door . I did some rolls on the snare to warm up . Harmony got out her bass , and Trin started tuning her electric . I asked what song we should start with . Trin looked past me , smiled her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imagine pounding to the edge of a cliff on the back of a black stallion , overlooking the Pacific Ocean - " " Just do n't run over Mello . She 'll be sitting on that cliff , reading , " Harmony said . I shook my head . " If we do n't get started , I 'll never get to chill . We 'll be practicing the whole time . " " Should I bring the camera ? " Lamont asked . " I can tape the concert . " " A concert on the beach ! " Harmony said . " It might be our biggest one yet . S , tape it ! " " But in order to do a concert , we 'll have to know what song we 're opening with , " I reminded them . " Which brings us back to why we 're here this - " " Are we changing to superhero suits halfway through ? " Harmony interrupted . " Wait ! I forgot to pack mine ! " Trin said , already walking across the room . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right now . " She packed her guitar into the case . " And I forgot bracelets ! I so am not good with last-minute packing . " " You definitely should do the super suits , " Lamont said . " That 's your trademark . It 's what makes the Chosen Girls stand out . Either super suits or chicken suits . " Harmony whirled to face him . " The chicken disaster is over . Do not mention the chicken suits , the chicken concert , or the chicken jingle unless you want me to practice my newest karate move on you . " Lamont shut his mouth , but he started humming the tune for Chik'n Quik / Chicken on a stick / It 's so yummy for your tummy /Everybody loves Chik'n Quik . Harmony put her guitar on the couch and raised her arms to fighting position . " You did n't say I could n't hum ! " Lamont cried , crossing his arms in front of his face in self-defense . " What about our practice ? " I asked Trin . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 'll have to do it when we get there , " she said as she ran out the door . " See you at one ! " Harmony put her arms down , and Lamont sighed in mock relief . She grabbed her bass , put it in the case , and fastened the latches . " Know what ? I forgot my new bracelets too ! " she said . " And I think I should take my purple flip-flops . " She moved toward the door . " Harmony , " I whined . " I do n't want to spend the whole time we 're there practicing for the concert . " She looked back at me . " Do n't worry , Mello . We 'll be fine , " she said . Then she left too . I looked at Lamont . " Please do n't tell me you need to pack bracelets or flip-flops , " I begged him . He shrugged . " Nope . But I do need to get my camera and the charger and - " " Fine ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked toward the door and said , " Mello , the concert will be great . The Chosen Girls can do this with their eyes closed . What 's wrong with you ? " I shook my head . I did know one thing - now that the Chosen Girls were officially involved , this retreat would be anything but downtime. (
