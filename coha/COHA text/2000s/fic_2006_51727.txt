MARY HAD HAD IT . The kids-kids ? ! Seth was forty and Stefani was fortyone-had been fighting since San Cristobol . " You are . " " I am not . " " Yes you are . " Sitting in the back seat of the cramped rental car , Mary translated their backand-forth invectives into Spanish for the softness , the quick prettiness of the language , but her pulse still beat with impatience and her stomach churned and curdled . " Would you both knock it off ? " she said at last . " This is supposed to be a fun trip . " <p> " Mother , " Stefani warned . Mary shrugged and turned her hearing aid off . Seth had a large gray mole on the back of his neck that trembled when he shouted , she noticed , and Stefani flipped her hair around like a horse swatting flies . They had been a beautiful couple when they first married , but they were a haggard , adulterous , materialistic twosome now . It was not her fault . Not her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read Seth 's lips as he turned in profile , mole bobbing- You need a fucking U-Haul And Stefani , equally unimaginative , replied , What I need is a man who is n't a fucking miser . <p> If we did nothing else right , Mary thought , Stefani 's father and I knew how to fight . Did n't Stefani know that Seth got a deal on this rental car ? Did n't Seth know that Stefani shopped ? Mary sat jammed among garden urns , a wrought-iron wine rack that had somehow been torched to look rusted , a pile of woven rugs , three hammocks , and several extremely sharp-edged tin mirrors that , stacked in the seat beside her , reflected her face upside down , making her slight double chin a triple monster and all the hairs on it long as silver boar bristles . She regarded her reflection , remembering the handsome old boatman who had given her a wink as he oared her and the kids through a lake strangled with floating lilies . <p> She turned to the window . The mountains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The air outside , she thought wistfully , probably smelled of that smoke-blue woodsmoke from dinner fires , small good dinners of roasted corn and chicken marinated in limes and chilies ; she 'd never breathe in those smells because Stefani insisted on keeping windows up , AC on . Speeding , Seth swung around stocky Mayan women in embroidered blouses walking single file along the edge of the forest , dark-faced men bicycling back to their villages . Every now and then a few shacks appeared and disappeared . Mary waved to the children standing in their dusty yards with their dogs and their pigs , but they did n't wave back-why should they ? Just another old American lady passing by . <p> Her stomach gave a decided lurch . " I 'll need a bathroom soon . " She could never tell how loud her voice was with her Telex off ; not very loud now , apparently , because neither turned to acknowledge her , though Seth , scowling , waved toward the scenery as if to say : No gas stations , no towns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and around , into the clouds . Mary rubbed her belly and sat back . She had always loved car trips ; she was a good traveler . San Cristobol had been her favorite city so far , and her favorite place its cathedral , where , kneeling , she had celebrated the Feast of the Assumption that morning with beautiful brownskinned women in brocaded huipils , men in pink scrapes , businessmen in polyester shirts , teenage soldiers , children , and a vanload of chatty French tourists . But some fruit she had bought from one of the shawled vendors on the cathedral stairs was not setting right . She could feel a dark evil fluid start to burble inside her . " I 'm getting sick , " she announced . <p> I told you not to eat those plantains . This was Stefani , mouthing . They were fried in pig fat . But oh no , you had to have them . <p> " They were delicious , " Mary explained . Stefani winced and sat back , and Mary , hand pressed to her abdomen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They had been green and greasy , and she had eaten them only to spite her knowit-all daughter who had eaten nothing but PowerBars since Merida . She had been an idiot to bring Stefani and Seth to Mexico . Just because she had had the happiest years of her childhood here-years ago-did not mean that they would enjoy what she enjoyed : the soft warmth of the mountain sunshine , the earth colors of the sky at dawn . She smiled , remembering the lively community of expatriate artists her parents had reared her in . It was a childhood of flowers and fountains and fiestas , and she would trade it for nothing . She snapped her hearing aid back on and leaned forward , hoping to distract the kids with a story of her happy early life , but a new stomach cramp stopped her . <p> She pursed her lips and pressed her buttocks together , trying to suppress an insistent fart , but it exploded anyway , and she watched as Seth and Stefani turned to accuse each other , and then , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altogether and flood her jeans and the scratchy woven rug she 'd been forced to sit on for lack of room . Horrified , she tipped her head back and closed her eyes . <p> " She 's dead ! " Stefani cried . <p> Oh honestly . <p> Still , it was a good idea . Mary kept her eyes closed . <p> " The smell ! " Seth swerved so that one of the mirrors tipped and scratched Mary 's arm . " I ca n't take the smell . " <p> " My mothers dead and all you can think about is the smell ? " <p> " I do n't like the smell of dead people , OK ? Is that OK with you ? It has nothing to do with your mother , per se . " <p> " Per se ? Excuse me ? This is my mother we are talking about ! " <p> " Well , what do you want me to do ? What are we going to do ? Tell me what to do . " <p> " We have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I do n't know ! We need to find some Mexican and ask for help . " <p> " We do n't speak Spanish . Only your mother speaks Spanish . " <p> " Only my mother spoke Spanish . " Tears . Then , " We 're in the middle of nowhere . " <p> " I really can not stand the smell . " <p> Brakes . Seth throwing up by the side of the road , Stefani begging him to pull himself together . Mary opened her eyes . It was dark . She was surprised . She was n't aware that much time had passed . Maybe she really was dead . But no , she could smell herself . It was n't that bad . Just natural human shit . It did n't feel that bad either , cooling around her ass and thighs like a mud bath in a spa . Still , it was humiliating . As old age was humiliating . As being in the backseat with children in charge was humiliating . <p> " I ca n't drive with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We are not going to leave my mother-who paid for this trip in the first place , if you will recall-dead by the side of the road . " <p> " I was thinking , " Seth mumbled , " we could strap her to the top of the car . " <p> " Do what ? " <p> " Wrap that rug around her and strap her on top . Until we get to a phone . " <p> Silence . <p> " Until we find a hospital . " <p> Silence . <p> " It 's the only way I 'll be able to drive , honey . " <p> Mary opened her mouth to scream a protest but nothing came out . Stunned , she made herself still and stiff as the corpse she was supposed to be while , nagging and gagging , the two people she had once loved more than anyone in the world wrapped her in the rug , hoisted her up , and strapped her to the roof with rope from one of the hammocks . When they got back inside the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared up at the stars . She could smell the smoke now and the deep smell of the pines and feel the cold fresh wind . She had never felt so free , so lonely , so invisible , or so angry . Below she knew her daughter and son-inlaw would still be fighting . They had fought over the house she had bought them , the dental work she had paid for , the debts she had settled . They did n't mind fighting . They liked it . They probably even liked each other . I 'm the one they do n't like , Mary thought . I 'm just an inconvenient old lady with a convenient bank account . She began to cry , then let herself once again be taken by the beauty of the night sky above her ; and eventually , despite the irregular jolt of the car beneath her , she fell asleep . <p> When the car braked , she awoke . Struggling to lift her head , she saw they had stopped before a dusty little outpost sitting all by itself at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with green and red bulbs . She heard the kids dash out of the car and run toward it . She would wait until they returned and then she would confess and tell them the truth , and they could all fly home and put this nightmare behind them . <p> But minutes went by . And more minutes . And more . Finally Mary untied the hammock ropes and sat up . The front of the tienda was stacked with the same bright woven tapestries Stefani had been looking for . She 's shopping ! Mary thought . Damn her . She 's shopping , and Seth is haggling , and they 'll be in there for hours . She slipped down the side of the car and into the driver 's seat , pulled the extra set of keys from the glove compartment , started the engine , and drove off . She did not permit herself to laugh for miles , but once she started , she could not stop . She could picture the kids when they came out and found the car gone . They 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead body on top . They would start to argue about whose fault it was . <p> Mine ! Mary thought , exultant . Mine , all mine ! <p> She 'd give anything to see their faces . But that was the trouble with being dead : You could n't hang around and enjoy things . She 'd just have to head back to the resort with the lily lake , clean herself up , buy some pretty clothes , and find that good-looking boatman . Then she 'd call her lawyer back in the States , get her will changed , buy a house up here in the mountains , and settle down at last to the life she had always meant to live . <p> Author Affiliation
