ONE <p> I could smell him  --  or rather the booze on his breath  --  before he even opened the door , but my sense of smell is pretty good , probably better than yours . The key scratched against the lock , finally found the slot . The door opened and in , with a little stumble , came Bernie Little , founder and part owner ( his ex-wife , Leda , walked off with the rest ) of the Little Detective Agency . I 'd seen him look worse , but not often . <p> He mustered a weak smile . " Hey , Chet . " <p> I raised my tail and let it thump down on the rug , just so , sending a message . <p> " I 'm a little late , sorry . Need to go out ? " <p> Why would that be ? Just because my back teeth were floating ? But then I thought , What the hell , the poor guy , and I went over and pressed my head against the side of his leg . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , the way I like . Bliss . How about a little more , down the back of the neck ? I hunched my shoulders a bit , giving him the idea . Ah , nice . Very nice . <p> We went outside , me and Bernie . There were three trees out front , my favorite being a big shady one just perfect for napping under . I lifted my leg against it . Wow . Had n't realized I was that close to desperation . The night filled with splashing sounds and I zoned out a little , listening to them . I managed to stop the flow  --  not easy  --  and save some for dampening the rock at the end of the driveway and the wooden fence that separated our property from old man Heydrich 's next door , plus a squirt or two between the slats . Only doing my job , but do n't get me started on old man Heydrich . <p> Bernie was gazing up at the sky . A beautiful night  --  soft breeze , lots of stars , lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A new tennis ball on the lawn . I went over and sniffed it . Not one of mine , not anyone 's I knew . <p> " Wan na play fetch ? " <p> I pawed the thing . How did it get here ? Cooped up all day , but I 'd kept an ear cocked ; except for when I dozed off , of course . <p> " Bring it here , Chet . " <p> I did n't want to , not with this stranger 's smell on it . <p> " Come on . " <p> But I never said no to Bernie . I gave the ball a lick or two , making it mine , then took it over to Bernie and dropped it at his feet . Bernie reared back and threw the ball up the canyon road . <p> " Uh-oh  --  where 'd it go ? " <p> Where 'd it go ? He really could n't see it ? That never failed to surprise me , how poorly he saw after the sun went down . I tore after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plain sight , got my back feet way forward and sprang , totally airborne , snaring it on the short hop , the way I like , then wheeling around in one skidding motion and racing full speed , head low , ears flattened by the wind I was making , and dropped it at Bernie 's feet , putting on the brakes at the last moment . If you know something more fun than this , let me in on the secret . <p> " Got it on the short hop ? Could n't tell from here . " <p> I wagged my tail , that quick one-two wag meaning yes , not the over-the-top one that wags itself and can mean lots of things , some of which I 'm not too clear on myself . <p> " Nice . " He picked up the ball and was rearing back again when a car came slowly down the street and stopped in front of us . <p> The window slid down and a woman leaned out . " Is this thirteen-three-oh-nine ? " <p> Bernie nodded . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " You found him . " <p> She opened the door , started to get out , then saw me . " Is the dog all right ? " <p> Bernie stiffened . I felt it ; he was standing right beside me . " Depends what you mean . " <p> " You know , is he safe , does he bite ? I 'm not that comfortable around dogs . " <p> " He wo n't bite you . " <p> Of course I would n't . But the idea was planted in my head , for sure . I could tell by all the saliva suddenly pooling in my mouth . <p> " Thanks . You never know about dogs . " <p> Bernie said something under his breath , too low for even me to hear ; but I knew I liked it , whatever it was . <p> She got out of the car , a tall woman with long fair hair and a smell of flowers and lemons , plus a trace of another smell that reminded me of what happens only sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be like , having it turned on all the time ? Probably drive you crazy . I glanced at Bernie , watching her , patting his hair into place . Oh , Bernie . <p> " I 'm not sure where to begin . Nothing like this has ever happened to me . " <p> " Nothing like what ? " <p> She wrung her hands . Hands are the weirdest things about humans , and the best : you can find out just about everything you need to know by watching them . " I live over on El Presidente . " She waved vaguely . <p> El Presidente : Was that the one where the sewer pipes were still going in ? I was bad on street names  --  except our own , Mesquite Road  --  but why not ? I did n't need them to find my way . <p> " My name 's Cynthia Chambliss . I work with a woman youhelped . " <p> " Who ? " <p> " Angela DiPesto . " <p> Mercy . I remembered endless nights parked in front of motels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , me and Bernie , never even accepted any in the old days . But now we were having cash-flow problems , as Bernie put it . The truth was , I did n't really know what " cash-flow problems " meant , but whatever they were , they woke Bernie in the night , made him get up and pace around , sometimes lighting a cigarette , even though he 'd worked so hard to stop . <p> Bernie did n't commit to anything about Angela DiPesto , just gave one of those little nods of his . Bernie was a great nodder . He had several different nods I could think of off the top of my head , all very readable once you knew what to look for . This particular nod meant : strike one . <p> " The fact is , Angie spoke of you highly  --  how you stuck it to that creep of a husband . " She gave herself a little shake . I can do that way , way better . " So when this happened , and you being practically in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She rocked back and forth slightly , the way humans do when they 're very nervous . <p> " When what happened ? " <p> " This thing with Madison . She 's disappeared . " <p> " Madison is your daughter ? " <p> " Did n't I say that ? Sorry . I 'm just so upset , I do n't know what I 'm ... " <p> Her eyes glistened up . This was always pretty interesting , the crying thing ; not the sound  --  I could relate to that  --  but the waterworks , as Bernie called them , especially when Leda was on the producing end . They get upset , humans , and then water comes out of their eyes , especially the women . What is that all about ? Bernie gazed down at the ground , shuffled his feet ; he did n't have a handle on it , either , although I 'd once seen water seeping out of his own eyes , namely the day Leda had packed up all Charlie 's things . Charlie was their kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Leda except for visits . We missed him , me and Bernie . <p> This woman  --  Cynthia ? Chambliss ? whatever her name was  --  the truth is , I have trouble catching names at first , sometimes miss other things , too , unless I have a real good view of the speaker 's face  --  took a tissue from a little bag she carried and dabbed at her eyes . " Sorry . " <p> " Nothing to be sorry for . How long has Madison been missing ? " <p> The woman started to answer , but at that moment I heard something rustling in the bushes on the far side of the driveway . The next thing I knew , I was in the bushes myself , sniffing around , maybe even digging , but only the littlest bit . Some kind of smell was in the air , frog or toad , or ... uh-oh : snake . I did n't like snakes , did n't like them at  --  <p> " Chet ? You 're not digging in there , are you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Bernie . Oops  --  my tail was down , tucked back in a guilty manner . I stuck it right up , high and innocent . <p> " Good boy . " He patted my head . Thump thump . Ah . <p> The woman was tapping her foot on the ground . " So you 're saying you wo n't help me ? " <p> Bernie took a deep breath . His eyes looked tired . The booze was wearing off . He 'd be sleepy very soon . I was feeling a bit sleepy myself . Plus a little taste of something might be nice . Were there any of those rawhide chew strips left in the top drawer by the kitchen sink , the ones with that Southwestern flav  --  <p> " That 's not exactly what I said . Your daughter did n't come home from school today . That makes her gone , what , not yet eight hours ? The police wo n't even open a missing-persons file till a full day 's gone by . " <p> Eight hours I had trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from when the sun rose over the hills behind the garage to when it went down behind the hills on the other side . <p> " But you 're not the police . " <p> " True , and we do n't always agree , but I agree on this . You say Madison 's a sophomore in high school ? So she 's what ? Sixteen ? " <p> " Fifteen . She 's in the gifted program . " <p> " In my experience , fifteen-year olds sometimes forget to call home , especially when they 're doing something impulsive , like going to the movies , or hanging out , or partying from time to time . " <p> " It 's a school night . " <p> " Even on school nights . " <p> " I told you  --  she 's gifted . " <p> " So was Billie Holiday . " <p> " I 'm sorry ? " The woman looked confused ; the confused human face is almost as ugly as the angry one . I did n't get the Billie Holiday thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this singer Bernie listened to , especially when he was in one of his brooding moods . <p> But even if no one got what he was talking about , Bernie seemed pleased with himself , like he 'd scored some point . I could tell by the smile that crossed his face , a little one , quickly gone . " Tell you what . If you do n't hear from her by morning , give me a call . " He held out his card . <p> She gave the card a hostile look , did n't touch it . " By morning ? Seventy-six percent of disappearances are solved in the first twelve hours , or they 're not ... " Her eyes got wet again , and her voice sounded like something was choking her throat . " ... solved at all . " <p> " Where 'd you hear that ? " <p> " I did n't hear it . I looked it up on the Internet before I drove over . What you do n't seem to understand is that Madison has never done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't help , you can recommend someone who will . " <p> Recommend another agency ? Had this ever happened before ? I could n't read the look on Bernie 's face at all . <p> " If it 's money you 're worried about , I 'm prepared to pay whatever you charge , plus a big bonus the moment you find her . " She reached into her bag , pulled out a roll , peeled off some bills . " How 's five hundred in advance ? " <p> Bernie 's eyes shifted over to the money and stayed there , his face now readable to anyone from any distance , his mind on cash flow . " I 'd like to see her room first . " When Bernie caved , he did it quickly and all at once . I 'd seen it with Leda a thousand times . <p> Cynthia handed over the money . " Follow me . " <p> Bernie stuffed the bills deep in his pocket . I ran over to our car  --  an old Porsche convertible , the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat of paint  --  and jumped over the passenger-side door and into my seat . <p> " Hey . Did you see what your dog just did ? " <p> Bernie nodded , the proud , confident nod , my favorite . " They call him Chet the Jet . " Well , Bernie does , anyway , although not often . <p> A coyote shrieked in the canyon , not far from the back of the house . I 'd have to deal with that later . I no longer felt tired at all . And Bernie , turning the key in the ignition , looked the same : rarin ' to go . We thrived on work , me and Bernie . <p> Copyright 2009 by Spencer Quinn <br> Continues ...
