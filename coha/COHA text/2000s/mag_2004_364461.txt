A Pakistani general helicoptered into a village in the Pakistani mountains of Waziristan last weekend to meet with a stubborn enemy . Lieut . General Safdar Hussain came to sign a truce with Nek Mohammed , a tribal leader whose pro-al-Qaeda fighters had eluded capture for more than six weeks and had killed about 80 of the general 's men . The Pakistani army agreed to halt its operation against Mohammed 's militants , repay Wazir tribesmen for war damages and set free most of the 160 suspected al-Qaeda supporters who were captured . The tribesmen were also allowed to keep their weapons . In exchange , Mohammed and his clan promised to refrain from attacks on Pakistani forces and the U.S. troops in nearby Afghanistan . Gleeful rebel tribesmen accepted the easy terms  --  and then treated Hussain to a meal of rice and slaughtered sheep . <P> The truce , however , could be a severe setback for the Bush Administration , which has been leaning on Pakistan to carry out a clean sweep of al-Qaeda and the Taliban from the tribal territory . Mohammed is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader Mullah Omar and was earlier accused by the Pakistani government of giving shelter to al-Qaeda fighters , possibly including Osama bin Laden . In this area Pakistani troops last month mistakenly thought they had cornered bin Laden 's deputy , Ayman al-Zawahiri . <P> A Pakistani army spokesman said operations were halted because it had succeeded in " smashing " terrorist bases . But no senior al-Qaeda or Taliban member was caught . A Pakistani official who brokered the truce says the deal included a guarantee from tribal leaders that " non-Pakistanis "  --  Arabs , Chechens and Uzbeks  --  would no longer cross from Waziristan to ambush U.S. troops in Afghanistan . But local officials in Waziristan say that promise is not enforceable . What 's more , the truce raises doubts about the resolve of the Pakistanis to root out al-Qaeda fugitives from the tribal areas . Said a U.S. military spokesman in Kabul : " At the end of the day , we expect Pakistani action there . "  --  By Tim McGirk and Ghulam Hasnain            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
