Japan has plummeted from economic powerhouse to Headnote faltering giant in less than a generation . What kind of future Headnote will be shaped by the forces that are driving Japanese society ? Photograph The Japanese economy continues to weather the economic downturn that began in the 1990s . In one scenario of Japan 's future , the country becomes a permanent secondtier economy . Like Great Britain and some Scandinavian countries , Japan delivers comparatively high levels of wealth , health , longevity , and literacy to its people-but does not recover its former position as a global economic leader . Photograph Japan 's " new breed " generation may help turn Japan 's economy around-and society on its head . The new-breed cohort is more cosmopolitan and accepting of outsiders than their parents and grandparents . As they mature and assume positions of authority , they could lead Japan to a more entrepreneurial future , according to historian David J. Staley. // Japan is crossing a threshold from one historic period into another but is uncertain which potential new era will emerge . The outcome will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the rubble of World War II , Japan prospered from 1960 to the late 1990s . Now that period of prosperity appears to have come to an end . Those three decades were characterized by Japan 's economic resurgence , high growth rates , a dedicated and group-oriented workforce , economic nationalism , relative cultural homogeneity , and a social structure that retained many of its premodern features , especially with regard to gender roles and family structure . The task of this article is to imagine the other side of this threshold , to inquire as to what the " next period " in Japanese social history may look like . Three Forces Create the Future The convergence of three large  --  scale driving forces will determine the resulting shape of Japanese society in this next period . These driving forces are the restructuring of the Japanese economy , the long-term effects of demographic change , and the coming of age of the generation known as the " new breed . " * Restructuring of the Japanese economy . The economic downturn of the 1990s seems to be having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the yen or of the real estate market . The systems of lifetime employment , of devoted " salarymen " who overworked themselves for the good of corporation and country , and of capitalism dominated by corporate bureaucrats and government ministers have been seriously undermined . Japan is losing its hold as a leading economy and is instead chasing the rest of the industrialized world . * The long-term effects of demographic change . By the first quarter of the twenty-first century , a significant portion of Japan 's population will be over 65 years old and the birthrate will hover very close to 0% . These demographic trends will influence both the economy and the social , cultural , and familial institutions of Japan . Older Japanese will need to be cared for ; no system of social security of the American or European variety now exists . The burden may well fall to families , specifically to women . The slower birthrates and grayer population will put pressure on labor markets , as companies scramble to find enough skilled and unskilled workers . * The coming of age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new breed . " These are the children of the postwar generation that rebuilt Japan with their hard work and self-sacrifice . This younger generation has not known poverty , or even deep economic recession . Critics complain that they are not as devoted and driven as their parents , and are content to enjoy the benefits of materialism and consumerism . They appear more individualistic than earlier generations , less willing to sacrifice for the group . Older Japanese find them rude and without values . At the same time , the new breed appear more cosmopolitan , more accepting of outsiders , and less bound by traditional gender assumptions . This generation may well hold the key to the shape of the next period in Japanese history . As they mature and assume positions of responsibility , the new breed may govern Japan in a radically different fashion than previous generations . On the other hand , like American baby boomers who were radical in their youth but who acted more like their parents as they matured , the Japanese new breed could begin to think and act as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japanese history far from a radical break . The effects of these three driving forces-economic restructuring , aging population , and " new breed " generation-will not be felt in isolation . Rather , the confluence and collision of these forces will spin off the effects that will characterize this next period . What follows are four plausible " next periods " covering the coming 20-25 years of Japan 's future . 1 . Entrepreneurial Japan Group identification and self-sacrifice were important keys to the post  --  war reconstruction of Japan , but with the downturn of the 1990s , the Japanese government has perceived the need for more individual initiative in order to bolster Japan 's economy and to make it competitive once again . The government has begun to sponsor schools that will teach entrepreneurship . Talented individuals aspiring to be infotech entrepreneurs are flocking to American universities , bypassing Tokyo University , the traditional training ground of the Japanese elite . In effect , Japan is borrowing the idea of entrepreneurship from the West , specifically from the United States . Photograph A businessman takes a break @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his generation in the first quarter of the twenty-first century will have significant effects on Japan 's way of life . Older Japanese will have to be cared for , and Japan has no system of social security comparable to the systems in the United States and European countries . // 3 forces SHAPING JAPAN 'S FUTURE // An entrepreneurial Japan might take one of two forms . In one scenario , entrepreneurship remains wedded to the corporate structure , assuming the form of " intrapreneurship . " Rather than allowing talented individuals to form their own companies , established companies harness the creativity and risk-taking initiatives of young entrepreneurs to their own corporate decision-making structures . The corporation rewards not the team but individuals , through promotions . However , the economic benefits of risk taking continue to go to the company , not to the individual . In an alternative version of this scenario , Japan borrows an entrepreneurial culture that looks more American than Japanese . Japanese schools emphasize creativity and problem solving rather than rote memorization , in order to more fully develop the individual rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new breed " generation break away from the large corporations , build their own firms , and reap the benefits for themselves . In this scenario , the energy and dynamism of the Japanese economy comes from risk takers rather than from the long-term planning of corporate and ministerial bureaucrats . Today , conspicuous consumption and social differentiation based on wealth or income are looked down upon in Japan . But a new entrepreneurial Japan might produce a " cult of the entrepreneur , " where the individual visionary is lionized in the popular mind , rewarded for his initiative , and envied for his wealth . We may well see in the next 25 years a growing number of Japanese Bill Gateses. 2 . Japan as Number Two Borrowing entrepreneurship might allow Japan to regain its pre-1990 level of global economic dominance . Although the Japanese economy is no longer " number one , " it is easy to imagine that it might again rise to this level . Another plausible scenario , however , sees Japan as a second-tier economy , wealthy and healthy , but not a global @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , this Japan retains high rates of literacy , comfortable standards of living , and long average life-spans ; Japanese workers begin to value the quality of life more than before . The current wave of layoffs has been a shock to post-World War II Japan , as many companies appear to be abandoning the central tenet of the Japanese social contract : lifetime employment . That might explain the apparent apathy of the new-breed generation . Unlike their parents , Japanese young adults today do not expect lifelong employment and are wary about loyalties to companies and institutions that might easily abandon them . In this scenario , the decline in company loyalty leads to a decline in productivity . Workers no longer possess a single  --  minded devotion to the success of the company , a major factor in Japan 's postwar boom and position of economic leadership . Thus Japan 's economy fails to regain its position as number one even while providing a comfortable lifestyle for its citizens . As the movement toward a concern for quality of life grows , Japanese workers develop a greater concern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an increase in recreation , shopping , and other pursuits , including more profound uses of leisure time . In this scenario , Japan witnesses a spiritual revival , and more and more Japanese pursue traditional pastimes , such as flower arranging and Noh theater . A noteworthy feature of this scenario is the awakening of Japanese fathers . The time that workers might have spent on the job or socializing and team building with cohorts is instead given over to the enjoyment of family . Led by the new breed , men take on greater responsibilities for raising their children . 3 . An Inclusive Society Japanese women today have more theoretical rights granted in their constitution than women in the United States . However , in practice , Japanese women have little role in public affairs , the halls of government , or the boardrooms of corporations . Women in the workplace typically occupy lower-level clerical positions , usually in service to men . They are expected to leave the company once they are married and if they are pregnant . Inside companies and in popular images in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorative . The widespread use of " hostesses " by male executives and the ubiquity of miniskirt-clad pixies in Japanese cartoons symbolize the subservient status of women in contemporary Japan . As its population grays and as its birthrates continue to fall , Japan faces a potential shortage of both skilled and unskilled labor . In the Inclusive Society scenario , women are called upon to help make up the deficit . In order to make this possible , women are freed from the sole responsibility for childrearing ; their husbands share more familial responsibilities . Many couples bring their children to work , as child-care facilities become standard in all workplaces . Since women no longer have to leave work after they marry or have children , they remain in the workplace longer and ascend to positions of responsibility and leadership . Government and business leaders begin to recognize the value of this heretofore untapped pool of human capital . Photograph Girls express their individuality through fashion . Japanese women today are dismissed as cute and decorative , but the future of Japan 's economy may depend on society taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // Like American and European women who assumed male responsibilities in wartime , Japanese women 's participation in the workforce is vital to the nation . They begin to insist upon rewards for their services , including real equality rather than the paper equality promised in the Japanese constitution . Public groping of women-formerly accepted as a kind of " boys will be boys " prank  --  is no longer tolerated by either men or women . Like the samurai , hostesses become a relic of the Japanese past , popular in novels and movies but no longer a real presence . Women begin to assume leadership positions among the powerful ministerial bureaucracies and multi  --  national corporations , the seats of real power in Japan . A woman is elected prime minister , and women begin to lead the influential Bank of Japan and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry . Another way the Japanese might head off a projected labor shortage would be through the use of immigrant labor . The rise in the number of immigrant workers , coupled with the younger generation 's more cosmopolitan outlook @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Japan has long had a love/hate relationship with foreigners . While the Japanese have craved foreign goods , labor , and expertise , they have treated foreigners as outsiders . But in this scenario , as more immigrants arrive in Japan to fill job vacancies , they are gradually welcomed more formally into Japanese society . Immigrants are invited not only for their labor but to settle and establish families . Native Japanese warm to the presence of foreigners in their midst and welcome their food , customs , and culture , blending them with their own . Foods that once were unfamiliar become staples of the Japanese diet ; like pizza in the United States , foods that were once foreign become redefined as " Japanese . " The definition of Japanese is widened to include other people from Asia as well as Westerners . As they gain positions of influence , the more cosmopolitan new  --  breed generation adopts new policies that encourage more foreigners to reside in Japan . The traditional restrictions against citizenship are increasingly relaxed . Personal relationships and marriages between Japanese and non-Japanese become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demographic forces that allow for greater gender equality and multiculturalism may also harden traditional attitudes toward women and outsiders . It is tempting to assume that , because Japan is a modern industrial economy , its society and culture will inevitably begin to look more Western . However , it is just as plausible that demographic pressures might induce a conservative social reaction . In the retrenchment scenario , Japanese corporations continue their long-established practice of using industrial robots to fill the gap in both skilled and unskilled labor , rather than filling vacancies with women . This machine labor is supplemented by an increase in immigrant labor . Where women 's labor will see growing demand in this scenario is in the care of the nation 's elderly . Because the population is graying , more and more Japanese seniors need to be cared for . In the absence of assisted-living centers or a reliable system of social security , the burden for the care of the elderly falls upon families-its traditional source-and especially upon women . // Four Scenarios for Japan in 2025 // More pressing is the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advanced industrial societies , have been falling throughout the past 100 years . In this scenario , the government seeks both formal and informal means to raise the Japanese birthrate . Amid fears of the " death of Japanese culture , " official policies encourage couples to have many children . Women are encouraged to remain at home to raise children . Women who decide to remain childless or unmarried face shame and ridicule . Work outside the home is out of the question except in a few cases , and largely for young single women who will be expected to leave the workplace once they are married . Public opinion discourages women from seeking higher-status jobs in favor of the patriotic duties of motherhood . While many of the social abuses of women are eliminated , such as groping and unflattering mass media images , women remain second-class citizens whose public activities are circumscribed . The increase in the number of foreigners in Japan might have the effect of hardening traditional restrictions on and wariness of outsiders . In this scenario , Japan is not isolated from international trade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including linguistically . The presence of larger numbers of outsiders-made necessary because of demographic pressures and labor shortages-has a disquieting effect on the society at large . Conservatives who fear the death of Japanese culture increasingly speak of " a thinning of Japanese blood . " The foreigners who do come to Japan are isolated and ghettoized by the society at large . The boundary separating the Japanese from other groups remains firm . Discrimination against Koreans and Chinese continues , taking on newer , subtler forms . While there are no official policies , adults place informal pressures on young people to keep them from interacting with foreigners , and intermarriage is looked down upon . Citizenship requirements are very strict . Those foreigners who do intermarry produce children who are discriminated against . Externally , Japan fights to maintain its status as an island nation . Like the protectionism in the 1980s , which sought to shield Japanese industries from free trade , Japan seeks similar policies to protect its native culture . Although telecommunications makes the world seem more global , in this scenario information from the outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not learning new languages , most Japanese are cut off from a significant portion of international communications . While setting up protectionist cultural policies , the Japanese attempt to export their culture to the rest of the world , especially their popular culture . Regional neighbors are looked at with suspicion ; while only a handful of militants speak of a revival of empire , most Japanese affect a detached attitude toward regional alliances . Japan opts out of the global village . Outlook for Japan The final shape of the next period of Japanese social history will be determined by how the three large-scale driving forces of economic restructuring , demographic change , and the new-breed generation converge . Of the three , the new-breed generation holds an important key . As they enter positions of authority and responsibility , the actions , behaviors , and choices of this generation will determine if Japan 's future is more Western , inclusive , and global or neonationalist and culturally isolated . Despite its recent economic setbacks , Japan remains an important player in the global economic system . The next period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us affected by that system .
