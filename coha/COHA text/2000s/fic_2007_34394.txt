C H R I S T M A S 2 0 0 6 It 's Christmas night . Everyone is asleep in the house but me . From my den window I see it has started snowing , but not in earnest . It seems to me a kind of curtain falling on the day . There is a tranquillity to the moment that permeates my thoughts . I sit with a pencil and a pad of paper . I am prepared to write a story . This is not a Christmas story . Christmas is nearly over , dying like the fire in my fireplace , sharing the last of its warmth and light . Tomorrow the ornaments and decorations will come down , and we 'll put Christmas away in boxes and bins . But first our family will visit a cemetery only a short drive from our house . I 'll brush the snow from a headstone , then lay a potted poinsettia plant on its marble table . I 'll hold my wife and daughter , and we 'll remember a little boy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow or the fi rst flowers left . There will be two bouquets waiting . They 're there every year . You might already know some of our story  --  or think you do . Some of it made the news . But what you heard was just a few bars of a song , and badly played at that . Tonight this weighs heavily on my mind . I believe it 's time the world knew the whole truth , or at least asmuch as I can give them . So tonight , I begin to record our story for future generations . I know from the outset that many will not believe it . You may not believe it . No matter . I was there . I knew the boy and what he was capable of . And some things are true whether you want to believe them or not . Chapter One I was born with Tourette 's syndrome . If you 're like most people , you 're not sure what Tourette 's is but suspect it has something to do with shouting obscenities in public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's syndrome is a neurological disorder characterized by repetitive , involuntary movements ; things that make " normal " people uncomfortable . Some of us , about ten percent , curse in public . Some of us bark or make other animal noises . I have tics . I 've had more than twenty different manifestations , from vocal tics like clearing my throat and loud gulping to repeated eye blinking , shrugging , head jerking , and grimacing . My last tic was in my hands , and even though it hurt , I still preferred it to a facial tic , because you ca n't hide your face in your pocket . I also have a compulsion to spit in the face of famous people . I 've never actually spit in anyone 's face , probably because I do n't know anyone famous , but the impulse is there . I once saw Tony Danza at a Park City restaurant , and I put my hand over my mouth , just to be safe . The most peculiar of my symptoms is my need to touch sharp objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would find dollar bills folded into sharp corners . There 's linen in paper money , which gives it an especially sharp corner . But anything sharp brings me comfort . On my desk at work there are always a dozen or more highly sharpened pencils . People sometimes ask if my tics are painful . I invite them to try this experiment : blink sixty times in one minute and see how your eyes feel . Now do that for sixteen hours straight . I remember , as a boy , holding my face at night because I could n't stop it from moving , and it hurt . But more painful than the physical hurts were the social ones , like sitting alone in the school cafeteria , because no one wants to sit by someone making funny noises . The panicked look on a girl 's face when your own face is doing gymnastics as you ask her out . ( Tics are usually exacerbated by anxiety , and if asking a girl out does n't make you anxious , what does ? ) Or being surrounded by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what the freak will do next . There 's a reason I learned to keep to myself . Not surprisingly , I read a lot . Books are the most tolerant of friends . There were great books back then . Old Yeller , Andy Buckram 's Tin Men , Where the Red Fern Grows , The Flying Hockey Stick . But my greatest love was comic books . Not the kiddie rags like Archie and Jughead , but the Marvel ones , whose heroes had muscles on muscles , bulging through skin-tight costumes . Characters like Spiderman , Captain America , Ironman , and the Incredible Hulk . I would read my magazines before and after school and long into the night , falling asleep with the lights on . I was always dreaming of being someone special : able to walk through walls ( or knock someone through one ) , to fly , to burst into flames , or to wrap myself in a force field  --  safe from whatever the bad guys could throw at me . Tellingly , the power I wanted most of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my wish when I was eight years old . I became invisible . Not to everyone . Just to those who mattered . *** Tourette 's was n't the worst part of my childhood . Five weeks after my eighth birthday , on Christmas Day , a tragedy destroyed my family . Ten months later my parents filed for divorce . But it was never finalized . My father took his life on December twenty-fifth , one year to the day tragedy struck . My mother was never well after that , physically or emotionally . She spent most of her time in bed . She never again hugged or kissed me . This was about the time my tics began . The month I turned sixteen , I moved out . I dropped out of school , piled everything I owned in the back of a Ford Pinto , and drove to Utah to live with a former schoolmate . I never even told my mother I was leaving . There was no reason to . I was rarely home , and we never spoke when I was . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing happened . But you 'd be wrong . It was something that I did . I suppose that 's why I do n't really blame my mother for how she treated me . Or my father for taking the back door out of life . It was my fault my life was such a mess . And Christmas was just another day on the calendar . I never believed it could be otherwise until I met Addison , Elizabeth , and Collin . *** The Bible says that God has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty . My story is about one of God 's weak things . His name is Collin , a frail , beautiful little boy with a very special gift .
