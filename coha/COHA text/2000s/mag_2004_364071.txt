Jay Leno has just written a children 's book , If Roast Beef Could Fly <P> Be honest . Did you actually write this ? I wrote this one . But I know what you mean . Most celebrities , there 's one word each page and there 's a Laura Ashley drawing of a cat . That 's what I wanted to avoid . <P> The book recounts a true childhood drama involving roast beef and a comb . How does your family feel about it ? It 's not exactly Roots . They all remember the incident . <P> Is it true you do n't spend the money you make from The Tonight Show ? People make such a big deal out of this . I never wanted to make my living as a TV personality . My mother always said , " Just finish college so you have something to fall back on . " Stand-up comedy has always been my thing ; the show is just something to fall back on . <P> How many cars do you have now ? You sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decide what to drive to work ? Well , I 'm sure there are people with bigger problems .
