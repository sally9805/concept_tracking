Section : Herb News Great news from government herb studies ! <p> To celebrate its opening , the Botanical Center for Age-Related Diseases at Purdue University in West Lafayette , IN , held a 1-day symposium earlier this year that featured a number of fascinating presentations . One of these focused on exciting new research on green tea . <p> Without question , polyphenols ( plant compounds with antioxidant properties that are found in green tea , blueberries , and chocolate , among other foods ) hold considerable promise for treating inflammation , slowing the aging process of the brain , and preventing cancer . It 's the latter that I find especially interesting . <p> The health benefits of green tea ( Camellia sinensis ) have largely been attributed to its antioxidant activity . However , two Purdue professors , D. James Morre , PhD , and Dorothy Morre , PhD , have identified a cancer-causing agent in cells that they have labeled tNOX . That is the target for the main polyphenolic constituent contained in green tea , which carries the jaw-breaking name ( - ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> NOX proteins are found on the surface of cells and cause cells to increase in size . Because cells must reach a certain size before they can divide and increase in number , as they do in cancer , a compound that inhibits NOX from acting also prevents the cells from getting large enough to divide . Consequently , they simply die off by a process known as apoptosis ( programmed cell death ) . This process literally stops cancer before it starts . The bottom line is this : The EGCg in green tea prevents cancerous cells from increasing in number but does not affect normal cells . Timing is Everything <p> But there 's a problem with EGCg . To be truly effective , blood levels of the polyphenol must be maintained at a constant high level . When the level goes down , the cancer cells begin to grow again . It is estimated that drinking 1 cup of green tea an hour would be required to maintain appropriate activity . That 's a bit much , though it is certainly possible to do that during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every hour all night long to drink a cup of tea . What to do ? <p> On the horizon are green tea products in time-release capsule form . But in the meantime , remember that green tea is loaded with good-for-you compounds . Enjoy it frequently . <p> Lots more research remains to be done on EGCg . We need to understand its mechanism of action more thoroughly and learn the reason why it works specifically against tNOX . And the way it works in unison with other polyphenols is also worth exploring . It is possible that other combinations might prove even more effective than the natural mixture found in green tea . Right now , green tea satisfies many of the qualities of an ideal cancer preventive/treatment . We know that it works well with no or very low toxicity , can be taken orally , is consumer friendly , and is cheap . More Herb News on the Horizon <p> If you think the green tea discovery is amazing , just wait . In my estimation , it 's very likely that you 'll soon be reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's because the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) in Bethesda , MD , has recently funded four botanical research centers at major universities in the US . At UCLA , the research is primarily devoted to Chinese red yeast rice , green tea extract , and St. John 's wort . At the University of Illinois at Chicago , the studies are focusing on herbs for women 's health . Herbs for age-related conditions ( especially herbs containing polyphenols ) are being examined at the University of Alabama-Birmingham and at Purdue , where the aforementioned green tea studies were conducted . The center at the University of Arizona in Tucson is studying ginger , turmeric , and boswellia to learn what their effects are on inflammatory diseases such as arthritis . These botanicals are used in Ayurvedic medicine , which is the 5,000-year-old medical system of India . I could n't be more delighted about all this focus on herbs . <p> Here 's why : Since it 's almost impossible to obtain a patent on herbal products , herbal product manufacturers are usually unwilling to invest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprofitable , because other companies can easily " borrow " their findings . That 's why most herbal studies , which cost a fortune , have been carried out in Germany , where laws and regulations actually promote such testing . <p> I congratulate the NIH Office of Dietary Supplements and its several partner institutes for this outstanding program . Doing what private parties can not do is certainly an admirable role for good government . At least some of your tax dollars are being well spent .
