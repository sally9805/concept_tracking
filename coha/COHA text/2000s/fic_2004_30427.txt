Chapter One The Early Childhood of Paul Bowles ( 1910-1918 ) " At birth I was an exceptionally ugly infant . I think my ugliness caused the dislike which my father immediately formed for me. " - - Paul Bowles to Bruce Morrissette , Jamaica , New York , January 14 , 1930 Paul Bowles hated his father . There was never a time that he could remember not hating him . When Bowles was six , his grandmother Henrietta Winnewisser told him that his father had tried to kill him when he was an infant . Henrietta could not abide her son-in-law and hoped that he would simply disappear before the child was irreparably injured . Bowles never doubted for a moment that his grandmother spoke the truth . Claude Dietz Bowles , Paul Bowles 's father , was a dentist who spent far more time with his patients than he did with his family , whom he sometimes found asleep when he climbed the steep steps of the old brownstone at 317 Fulton Street in Jamaica , New York , where he lived with his bride of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Claude did not appear promptly at 6:00 P.M. for dinner - when he insisted that it be ready and on the table - his wife , Rena , ate alone , then left the dining room to breast-feed her infant in the nursery . On such nights Claude found his dinner in the oven , and he picked at it grudgingly as though he resented each bite . Claude saw his interloping son as the real culprit . A fresh-air enthusiast , he hated finding the infant swaddled in blankets in a stuffy nursery . One evening when his son was scarcely three weeks old , Claude stripped him naked and placed him in a wicker basket beneath the window , which he threw open to its full height . Had Henrietta not been awakened by her grandson 's persistent cries and discovered him lying under a dusting of snow , she was certain he would not have survived the night . To Claude she had overstayed her welcome , and he was impatient for her to leave . He even offered to hire a maid , temporarily , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of it and insisted that her mother could stay as long as she wished . Paul Frederick Bowles was not a pretty sight upon his breach birth on December 30 , 1910 . An ugly gash creased the side of his head , and on both temples a doctor 's forceps had left deep imprints . His mother 's two sisters noted that their nephew 's brow and crown were stretched grotesquely out of shape , but said nothing for fear of offending Rena herself . As a child , upon poring over early photographs , Bowles concluded that he resembled the pinheads at whom people gawked and snickered in the circus midway to which his mother 's two brothers had taken him . He , too , had gawked at his baby pictures and demanded an explanation . Rena admitted that for a time she had concealed his misshapen head under flounced bonnets , but onlookers were quick to assume that something terrible had occurred in the birth process . " The scar over my eye today is a reminiscence of those natal difficulties , " said Bowles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his dental practice to accompany his wife to the hospital . Scarcely an hour after their son 's birth , two nuns marched ceremoniously to her bedside and wrenched the infant from her arms . " Your baby must be baptized into the Roman faith at once , " the nuns whispered ominously . Rena threatened to scream and thwarted their mission . She and her husband were atheists , and the state of their son 's soul was a moot point should he fail to survive the night . Rena 's parents had traveled by train from their home in Bellows Falls , Vermont , to see their newborn grandson , and Henrietta stayed on for several weeks to help with the chores . She could tell that Claude was inordinately jealous of the baby and warned her daughter that his ill will would mount if she were not vigilant . When Rena announced that she wanted to name their son after her brothers , Frederick and Paul , Claude did not object . Any name suited him so long as the child was not a junior . Despite his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome boy with full lips , a well-shaped nose , a hint of a dimple in each cheek , a broad high forehead , blue eyes , and a crop of reddish-blonde curls that his mother refused to cut until he entered first grade . Bowles was twenty months old when Rena sent his picture to her sister Emma . " Paul has changed some since you saw him , has n't he ? " she wrote on the back of the snapshot . Even Claude was startled when at the age of two his son was reading aloud from cereal boxes and the labels on various household objects . Some of Bowles 's earliest recollections were of a circle of adults around him while he answered orthographical questions . Claude , already displaying his lifelong skepticism of his son 's talents , concluded that his wife had tutored him so that he would appear far brighter than he was . At three , Bowles wrote his first short story , an animal tale of two pages . " I wrote many short stories at that age , all of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showed them to anyone , even my mother . Sometimes I read them to my Aunt Emma when she stayed with us , and she seemed impressed . " Among Bowles 's fondest memories as a child was the half hour he was allowed to spend with his mother after dinner in the privacy of his bedroom . " Here I could count on having her all to myself . I could carry on a conversation with my mother , who treated me as an adult . When I was very young , she called me ' Honeybunch . ' I could sit on her lap and put my arms around her and hug her , but such behavior was strictly forbidden by my father once he witnessed it . I hated him for coming between us and spent much time thinking how I might retaliate . " Bowles was four when his mother read to him the stories of Edgar Allan Poe , which both terrified and intrigued him . " Looking back now , I am sure I would have discovered Poe eventually on my own , for we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first apartment . I was six when I read , from cover to cover , every Poe volume in the house , and before the year was out I read them all again . " Yet nothing by Poe was more horrifying to Bowles than his mother 's account of her brothers ' noses being smashed with a hammer by their father . She said that her grandfather 's nose had also been smashed , as were the noses of his brothers , a tale her father confirmed . " I was astonished when he told me that if the blow were performed well , there would be no permanent discoloration . Although I thoroughly disliked my father , I was relieved that I was not a Winnewisser . My nose was bad enough as it was , " he concluded . Bowles 's mother told him that she herself had devoted many hours to the improvement of his nose by gently squeezing and pressing the tender cartilage at its bridge . " Young bones and cartilage were malleable , she told me , and you had to be very careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were slated to be the next victim of the hammer , " said Bowles , who made no connection at first between his mother 's massaging of his nose and a conversation he overheard regarding a cousin 's allegation that the family was Jewish . Both before and during World War I , Marjorie Winnewisser spent several years in Berlin studying voice and performing in opera , and after the war she returned home to announce her engagement to an officer in the Royal Dutch Naval Reserve . " Why did n't you tell me we were Jewish ? " she demanded upon confronting her father . She told him that in Germany the name Winnewisser was originally spelled Vennevitz , and that her friends in Berlin feared for her safety . The name is " definitely Jewish , " they insisted and urged her to go home before she was persecuted . " Tell me the truth , Mother , are we Jewish ? " asked Bowles . Rena replied that if it were so , she had no knowledge of it . " Your great-grandfather was a firebrand when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of religion and wanted nothing to do with it . " Bowles concluded that his mother was skirting the question . A few months later he observed her looking at a photograph of herself in profile and heard her exclaim with obvious disdain : " ' Jewy , Jewy , Jewy ! ' I am sure my mother thought she looked Jewish , but I had no idea what characterized ' a Jewish look , ' and still do n't , " he added . Composer Leonard Bernstein , who knew Bowles well over the years , whispered upon meeting his mother : " Oh , Paul , she 's such a nice Jewish lady , and so very pretty . " Bowles was taken aback by his friend 's glib assumption and assured Bernstein that his mother was by no means Jewish . " Get off it ! Are you pretending , do n't you know she is or what ? " Bernstein retorted . Bowles never knew for certain if the Winnewissers actually were Jewish , but declared that if they were , it would serve his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got over his marrying Jane Stajer Auer , a Jew . Bowles 's great-grandparents Frederick George Winnewisser and Caroline Christiana Landshultz left Germany in 1848 , as did thousands of other emigrants of all ethnicities and national origins . Whether Frederick and Caroline knew each other before leaving their homeland is unclear , but both families came from the region of Essen , in Westphalia . Whereas Winnewisser came alone as a young man , Caroline was accompanied by her parents and brother and settled in the village of Hazardville , Connecticut , later known as Enfield . On April 3 , 1854 , Frederick and Caroline were married by a clergyman ; they went on to have six children . Only one did not survive . The oldest was Bowles 's grandfather August Frederick Winnewisser , who assumed the head of the household and the running of the farm after his father drowned at fifty in the Connecticut River . August was twenty-one when he claimed his inheritance and set out alone on horseback for Rockingham , Vermont . It was here that he met Henrietta Frances Barker , whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a brief courtship , they were married on Christmas Day , 1877 . Henrietta and her siblings were the sixth generation of Barkers born in New England , all descended from Richard Barker and his wife , Joannah , who had left Yorkshire , England , in 1623 and settled in Andover , Massachusetts . Of August and Henrietta 's eight children , five survived infancy : Emma , Rena , Ulla , Frederick , and Paul . The family lived first in a large wood-frame house at 48 Canal Street in Bellows Falls , just above the river and two doors from the general store that August had established before his marriage . A successful merchant , he soon moved his business a hundred yards above the river to Westminster Square , where the town hall , opera house , theater , shops , doctors ' offices , and library were situated . A Bellows Falls historian reported that Winnewisser " believed in the ' nimble sixpence ' rather than the ' slow shilling , ' " and sold " at bottom prices . " Large signs affixed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crockery , paper hangings , carpets , silver , plated ware , glassware , and picture frames . Soon Winnewisser was joined by two of his brothers , who opened shops of their own . Rena and her brother Frederick attended preparatory schools in Exeter , New Hampshire , while Emma , their oldest sister , was studying painting in New York City . With only Paul and Ulla at home , Winnewisser moved his family to a new two-story brick house on School Street , at the top of a wide bluff that had a sweeping view of the town and river . Had their home not been next door to the Immanuel Episcopal Church , an imposing edifice of stone and stained glass , and across the street from the First Baptist Church , Winnewisser , an atheist , would have relished even more his new location . A decade later , after being thrown from a horse , Winnewisser retired from merchandising and moved his family , first to Brooklyn , then to Lockwood , New York , where they lived briefly , and finally , to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just off the Boston Post Road . A two-story clapboard house overlooked 165 acres of rolling , forested hillsides , a large apple orchard , and a deep-running brook that emptied into the Connecticut River . Although the farm had been abandoned for over a year , Winnewisser and his sons soon made the house livable , scraping and painting a room at a time , rebuilding windowsills and doorjambs , replacing broken glass , installing flues , and settling in before the first snow ; moreover , Henrietta performed tasks she had never anticipated : supervising the canning and preserving of food from the garden , harvesting apples , overseeing the curing of meats , and cooking for her family and two hired hands . Each January , between snowfalls , she packed a valise and left the men to their own devices to spend three weeks with each daughter - all now married - who in turn left their husbands for a spring vacation with their parents at what they now called Happy Hollow Farm . At Christmastime each daughter returned to the farm with her husband and children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he rode the train with his parents to Springfield , but the fun did not begin until after his father had deposited them on the farm and returned to New York . Each summer Bowles and his mother spent two weeks at Happy Hollow Farm , which he cherished since it meant being free to roam as he saw fit . One summer his grandfather summoned him and two cousins who also were visiting and demanded to know if they believed in God . Having already decided that God was an invention by adults in order to manage their children more easily , Bowles said nothing , but his cousins answered quickly with enthusiasm : " Oh yes , Grampa , of course we do ! " " Pah ! There 's no god , " countered Winnewisser with a grimace . " It 's a lot of nonsense . Do n't you believe it . " Bowles had no idea until several years later that he had been christened at the age of one by his great-uncle the Reverend Henry Green , a Unitarian minister . " Of course my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that his parents had consented to it to humor Green . " I am sure they feared I would grow up a heathen . I could not help sympathizing with Gramma Winnewisser , who obviously worked harder than anyone else at Happy Hollow Farm . I surmised that she was a heathen , too . I ca n't say that I loved Gramma , but I liked her and respected her . It even occurred to me that she would have made a nice mother , yet the thought itself seemed irreverent since I already had a mother . " Although Bowles usually visited his father 's family in Elmira , New York , each summer after leaving the farm , he knew little about them except what he observed .
