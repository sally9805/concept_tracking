<p> For Lauren Artress , sitting glued to CNN wo n't do it . Protesting on Market Street ca n't match it . And burrowing under the covers in hopes of forgetting certainly does n't compete . <p> Her answer to coping in these nerve-jangling days ? <p> " Walk , " she said simply . " Walk it a couple of times . " <p> Artress is referring to the labyrinths inside and outside Grace Cathedral . As the church 's canon for special ministries  --  whose sole job is running labyrinth-related programs  --  the Bernal Heights resident has seen a marked uptick in labyrinth walkers lately . <p> Although peace marches and keeping up with the news have their benefits , only labyrinth walking brings a sense of calm to the participant , Artress said . <p> " We 're in a very worried place right now , " she said . " People are concerned about war , about their retirement funds . When people are restless and do n't know what to do , why , that 's a great time to walk the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ benefits of merely walking in circles . But Artress  --  and a growing number of labyrinth lovers around the Bay Area  --  swear the circular paths offer peaceful calm in these increasingly busy , stressful times . <p> Nancy Carleton , 45 , of Berkeley , is so dedicated to increasing options for labyrinth walkers that she joined the new East Bay Labyrinth Committee . Its 10 members began meeting in January with the aim of building a labyrinth at a public , accessible spot such as a park or open space . Eventually , the group hopes to construct one downtown , as well , though it knows finding an open space in the crowded area will be difficult . <p> Labyrinths exist at the Sibley Preserve behind the Oakland Hills , but people usually only find them if friends-in-the-know point them out . Others can be found at local churches , but Carleton said she envisions a labyrinth completely free of any ties to an institution such as a church or hospital . <p> " Some people are put off by being in a heavily religious atmosphere , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ churches , it 's not necessarily a religious thing . It 's something anybody can experience  --  from fun and playful to very centering . " <p> Lately , it seems , labyrinth walkers have focused more on the activity 's centering aspect . Claire Sneddon , 78 , helped build the 48-foot labyrinth at the United Methodist Church in Walnut Creek in 1999 . Members of the congregation and its neighbors have used it as a form of respite from the news . <p> " You get all bent out of shape with the terror of things like going to war , and walking the labyrinth just seems to give you some inner peace , " she said . " You just kind of have to keep your mind focused on something that 's bothering you , and a lot of times by the time you 're finished , something has clicked . <p> " It 's hard to explain , but it happens . " <p> But it 's not just churches that are turning to labyrinths for solace . Ever since 1995 , when Artress helped build the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constructed in the Western Hemisphere in 600 years  --  labyrinths have been installed in parks , high schools , museums , hospitals , teen centers , spas , homes and even jails . ( Artress tracks them on the Web site for her nonprofit , Veriditas : The World-Wide Labyrinth Project . ) <p> Millions of people have walked 1,800 labyrinths around the country , with 1,100 people trained specifically to teach others how to walk them . Dozens of labyrinths have been built in the Bay Area . <p> Patients at the California Pacific Medical Center in San Francisco have found solace in the facility 's large labyrinth . In 1997 , Victoria Stone , a public health educator and interior designer , led the drive to install the nation 's first labyrinth at a hospital . Nearly 20 hospitals have followed its lead . <p> Patients often walk it before their chemotherapy treatments . Doctors use it as part of their prescriptions . Families walk it while waiting for their relatives to come out of surgery , and nurses use it to decompress during breaks . <p> " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health and healing , " Stone said . <p> " People need to be inspired , " Artress said . " We 're in a funky time . I do n't think I 've ever lived through a time like this , and I 'm 57 , so if I have n't , a lot of people have n't . <p> Labryinth walking , she said , provides " a quiet moment . It 's a time out . " <p> Quiet moments are rare at Monterey County Jail in Salinas , where 1,000 people live behind bars . Three years ago , sheriff 's deputies agreed to spend $3,000 on a large , white canvas with a purple labyrinth painted on it  --  an item that certainly stands out , said the Rev. Cynthia Montague , 49 , the jail 's chaplain . <p> " It 's a curious thing visually , " she said . " This is a graceless place with cinderblock and concrete floors . To have this 30-yard canvas spread out on the floor , it does engage the spirit like a piece of artwork might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the lounge , about 60 prisoners walk its path , with others preferring to " watch and wonder and sort of marvel , " Montague said . After each session , Montague has the prisoners write down their reactions . On a recent Monday evening , many wrote of enjoying the peace and tranquility . One man wrote that he found himself humming , which he never normally does . <p> " There are very few quiet places in here , " Montague said . " There are always doors slamming and radios muttering and speaker announcements being made . They find this a calming thing . " <p> Perhaps the labyrinth 's most important offering to the prisoners is its metaphor for getting back on track , Montague said . <p> " If you accidentally step off the path and go onto a different part of the path , you might find yourself heading back out , " she said . " But you 're allowed to start over again and keep at it .

The avid gardener worked in science for 20 years , but then became a full-time labyrinth creator in 1987 , building the structures out of earth and plants in gardens . He has built 70 garden labyrinths  --  many using his own designs  --  including 40 in Northern California . <p> He designed the Meander Wand labyrinth at Santa Rosa 's Luther Burbank Center for the Arts . The gravel path sits between foot-high berms of earth , which have been covered in native grasses and poppies . About 300 people , including a dance troupe , bands and religious leaders , came to its consecration last year . <p> Gay Dawson , the center 's director of visual arts , said people of all walks of life have used the labyrinth . <p> " Some are very New Agey . Some are healing from something . Some are more artsy , bohemian , " she said . " Some pray . Some simply walk . In this culture that we live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do this , do that , buy this , buy that  --  finding your way is something really grounded and simple . " <p> Don Berry , 56 , a humanities teacher at Oceana High School in Pacifica , said he appreciates the history and art behind labyrinths . He and another teacher led a short course on labyrinths , which culminated in kids building two of them near the school 's old football field . <p> " To some extent , it helped the kids get in touch with themselves and see ways to listen to themselves better , " he said . " They learned some history and had fun building the labyrinths , hauling the rocks around . <p> " I do n't think there are very many schools that have labyrinths , " he added with a chuckle . <p> Surprisingly , more homes are sporting labyrinths in their yards . <p> Dori Bohntinsky , 50 , of Hayward , had a very specific reason for building her labyrinth : honoring the memory of her 14-year-old daughter , C.J. , who died of a rare blood disease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle attracts deer , raccoons and gophers . It 's lit all night , and neighbors are invited to walk it whenever they like . <p> " After losing your child , asking why does n't help . There 's no answer to why , " she said . " The labyrinth has been a very healing process for us . It gives me time to reflect . " <p> Ellen Turner , 55 , of San Jose , moved into a large home overlooking San Jose five years ago . <p> She looked at the yard , a large flat expanse , and , " I just said , ' It needs a labyrinth . ' I did n't know why . " <p> Kate Abbe 's neighbors in Woodside have wondered why she built a labyrinth in her yard , as well . ( " I say , ' Come walk it , and you 'll understand , ' " she said . ) She usually walks it once a week , but has been walking it more often recently . <p> " There 's really nothing we can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " This is turning inward to a more spiritual spot . " <p> For Artress  --  a Cleveland native who attended Princeton Theological Seminary and joined Grace Cathedral in 1986  --  the labyrinth love began during a spirituality conference in New Jersey , at which she was instructed to walk a labyrinth made of masking tape stuck to the floor . She returned home with an idea brewing in her mind , but could n't quite identify it . <p> " I was walking around my living room , thinking , ' What is it ? What is it ? ' " she said . " Finally , it came  --  put a labyrinth in the cathedral . " <p> But when she told others at Grace about her idea , some were rather perplexed . <p> " It was like , ' Oh , a labyrinth ? Huh ? What ? ' " she said . " But if you are on fire with passion , people move over . Even though people thought it was a crazy idea , they did n't try to stop it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her to Chartes Cathedral , about an hour south of Paris , to see its famous labyrinth . Installed in 1201 , it had become a white elephant and was hidden under 250 chairs . When the group finished moving all the chairs and could finally view the majestic labyrinth , they grasped hands and began to walk its circles . <p> Soon after , Artress found herself consumed by labyrinths . In 1994 , she helped Grace install an indoor tapestry labyrinth measuring 36 feet across . The following year , Grace built a permanent outdoor labyrinth measuring 40 feet across . <p> Always open , the labyrinth has become a popular after-hours destination . One woman , a 911 dispatcher , works the graveyard shift and comes to the labyrinth during her 2 a.m. break . <p> Artress ' foundation , which is run by four full-time and three part-time staffers , coordinates a variety of labyrinth activities . Grace After Hours takes place on the second Friday of each month and entails the public walking the labyrinth by candlelight and listening to handbells .

She wants a labyrinth installed in the World Trade Center Memorial . <p> " We need them desperately , " she said . " We need them everywhere .

A labyrinth is designed for you to find your way . A maze is designed for you to lose your way . " <p> The way to walk a labyrinth : " There 's no right way or wrong way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk right into the center and walk right out . You can stay as long as you want .
