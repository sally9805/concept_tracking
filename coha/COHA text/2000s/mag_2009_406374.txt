The spring Lily Russell turned five , her best friend learned to ride a bicycle without training wheels and Lily wanted to try too . " We encouraged her to do it when she felt ready - it was a big deal the day we took the training wheels off . But once she learned , she became very competent very fast , " says her dad , David Russell . There are lots of good reasons for encouraging kids to ride a bike , says paediatric occupational therapist Cris Rowan , who lives in Sechelt , BC . Cycling develops balance and coordination , increases strength and provides an excellent cardiovascular workout , says Rowan . " Not only that , it 's fun ! " And cycling is a great activity to do as a family , whether it 's an after-dinner jaunt around the neighbourhood or a weekend tour of bike trails . Here 's a parent 's guide to helping kids get rolling : Ready ? Five 's about the right age to think of removing training wheels , says Rowan . To ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kids should be able to : * stand on one foot for 10 seconds , which indicates good core stability * skip and gallop , which indicates that your child has the ability to easily shift her weight from one side to the other * perform coordinated tasks with the lower body - for example , your child kicking a ball with alternate feet while running Set Once you 've determined that your child is ready , make sure his bicycle is a good fit . He should be able to : * touch both feet flat on the ground with about Wi inches clearance over the top tube * rest his hands comfortably on the handlebars . Looking at your child in profile , you should see a straight line running through the top of his head and along the spine , says Rowan . Leaning too far forward or back makes balancing more difficult . Go ! * Have your child sit on the bike , hands resting comfortably on die handlebars , feet flat on the ground . Now push forward and backward . This helps kids find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riding , says Rowan , is learning how to stop . It 's difficult to think about pulling hand brakes or pedalling backward when you 're about to crash . Teach your child how to stop with her feet : Continuing to hold the bike , ask your child to put her feet on the pedals and slowly move her forward . As you do so , say , " Feet down ! " As Russell was helping Lily learn , he would say , " You 've always got your feet . " * Gradually give your child the power : " You tell me when to take my hands off . " At first , kids typically say , " Put your hands back on " pretty quickly , says Rowan . This part of the process can take minutes , or it can take weeks . The important thing is to work with your child 's comfort level and her ability . Eventually you 'll be able to do this hanging on to just the seat , and running alongside with your hands off for longer periods . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad took it slowly at first . Says Russell , " I 'd just let go for a second , and then say , ' I 'm back . ' Pretty soon it was , ' You can let go now , Dad . ' " Expect a few spills , says Rowan , but also consider , ways you can help to minimize them . " Kids get freaked out when they get going fast and then they tend to crank the wheel , " she observes . Rowan suggests finding a place to practise where there is enough room to ride in a long , straight line without any obstacles . " They 'll soon get the hang of not over-correcting the steering . " If your child looks like she 's going to crash , grab the kid , not the bike . " It took Lily awhile to learn how to turn around while cycling and in the beginning she put the brakes on a lot , " says her dad . Do n't forget to get your camera to record the big moment . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Russell . " It was such a rush when she was free and pedalling on her own . It 's something you just do n't forget . "
