After 10,000 miles , hundreds of drumsticks , and gallons of sweet tea , our resident connoisseur found the pick of the chicks . Photograph left : A heaping platter of fried chicken guarantees happy faces at Babe's. // Fried chicken feeds the soul of the South . This regional favorite ranks right up there with God , Mama , and country . Authors have penned tomes on the subject . Feuds have erupted over whose fried chicken tastes the best . Some cooks even guard their recipes with the zeal of armed guards at Fort Knox . Now , some might consider it folly to step into the midst of such a debate . Not me . I was raised on fried chicken . I learned the recipe at my mother 's elbow . On occasion , I was even called upon to select dinner from my very own feathered flock . So I know chicken . It 's as much a part of me as my eye color . To find the South 's best , I relied on many sources , but the most valuable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received hundreds of letters nominating favorite restaurants . But perhaps the most eloquent summation came from Florence Bishop of Richmond , Virginia . She writes , " I 've always thought that if I make it to heaven , every meal will be fried chicken , fresh asparagus , and strawberries . " Amen , Ms. Bishop ! After months of searching , I can tell you one thing for sure . You 'll find a little bit of heaven here on Earth if you visit one of these great chicken places . Babe 's Chicken Dinner House , Roanoke , Texas If we were offering a Readers ' Choice Award , it would go to this Texas spot . In fact , we received more letters about Babe 's than any other place . This chicken shack occupies an old hardware store in the heart of Roanoke , a tiny town northwest of Fort Worth . Though sprawling suburbia is quickly closing in , the town maintains its dry , dusty Texas character . A big neon chicken sign points the way to the simple brick building , though it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowd gathered on the front porch . Once you 're seated at one of the tables with funky mismatched chairs , a waitress hurries over with a big Texas-style welcome , passing out warm plates and cold bowls . Then she cheerfully asks , " Fried chicken or chicken-fried steak ? " The meal starts with a simple iceberg lettuce salad with vinaigrette dressing to fill the chilled bowls . Then heaping platters of chicken come steaming from the kitchen , followed by bowls of cream-style corn , mashed potatoes , and cream gravy . Plentiful homemade biscuits finish the parade . " The only thing we cook up ahead of time is the cream gravy , " owner Paul Vinyard observes . " That gravy gets a little better the longer it sits , but the others-mashed potatoes , corn , chicken-we just do them over and over in small batches . When we make biscuits , we make one little-old pan of 20 at a time . " " We work so hard at keeping it fresh , " says Mary Beth ( aka Babe ) , echoing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of your grandmother 's kitchen . That 's really our goal-to make you feel like you 're eating in your grandmother 's home . " 104 North Oak Street , Roanoke , Texas ; ( 817 ) 491-2900 . Platter of chicken with all-you-can-eat sides : $8.99 . Bubba 's Cooks Country , Dallas While feasting at Babe 's , I ca n't shake the feeling that I 've tasted this food before . That 's when I discover that Paul and Mary Beth Vinyard own another of my favorites , Bubba 's Cooks Country in Dallas 's tony University Park neighborhood . In fact , I like the chicken at Bubba's-dare I say it-just a trifle bit better than that at Babe 's . " It 's the same recipe , " Paul assures me . " There 's no difference between the two . " It turns out that Paul , a food company **29;744;TOOLONG , started Bubba 's in 1981 , long before there was a Babe 's . " My wife , Mary Beth , and I both grew up in small towns , " rumbles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the food that we grew up on in West Texas , and we really could n't find it in Dallas . " The restaurant is located in a dolled up 1928 Texaco gas station across the street from Southern Methodist University . It 's called Bubba 's , not because that 's Paul 's nickname as most people think , but because it was the complete opposite of the upscale offerings nearby . Here , customers step up to the counter to order . In addition to fresh , hot chicken , they offer mashed potatoes with cream gravy , green beans , coleslaw , baked beans , and fruit salad . Other veggie selections change daily . Heavenly homemade yeast rolls top off the meal quite handsomely . They 're made especially to be served with the sorghum and Texas Hill Country honey that sit on each on the table . Paul and Mary Beth are planning to open two more restaurants , making the score Babe 's : 5 , Bubba 's : 2 . Original Bubba 's Cooks Country : 6617 Hillcrest , Dallas ; ( 214 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ron Winans Chicken &; Waffles , Atlanta I 've eaten so much chicken that I can almost tell just by looking if it 's going to be good . The second I spy the waitress carrying my plate here , I know it 's going to be superb . The skin on the chicken shimmers with a golden hue . Marinated overnight in a mixture of salt , pepper , garlic , and other secret seasonings , it 's a crispy masterpiece on the outside , tender and juicy on the inside . The sides sing with flavor too . There 's cheesy macaroni ; rice with cream gravy ; and tender , succulent collards seasoned with smoked turkey . I crumble my cornbread in the pot liquor from the greens so I can savor every drop of goodness .

Made from a malted batter , their sweetness blends harmoniously with the savory chicken . " Food should be a party in your mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blending of sugar and salt really brings out the rich flavor in our food . That 's why the combination has been so successful . " Reginald did n't invent the chicken-and-waffle craze , but the Alabama-born chef added his own twist to the trend , serving up what he calls Nuevo Soul Food . " It 's a little lighter , but with a different flair to it , " he explains . As you might expect , the restaurant looks more like a chic lounge than a chicken joint . The walls boast rich , warm paneling adorned with music memorabilia and celebrity photographs of Gladys Knight , Ron Winans , and friends . Caramel-colored leather covers the comfortable booths and chairs . The restaurant stays open late on weekends to serve entertainers and other night owls . 529 Peachtree Street NE. , Atlanta ; ( 404 ) 874-9393 . Three-piece dinner : $11.50 . Price 's Chicken Coop , Charlotte There 's nothing fancy about this restaurant . In fact , there 's not even a place to sit down and enjoy your meal , but we sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One reader even went so far as to visit www.mapquest.com and print out directions for us to follow . Still , I was skeptical . The lunch counter occupies a simple redbrick building in the shadow of downtown Charlotte . I arrive at three o'clock in the afternoon only to find a line trailing out the door . At lunchtime , it is not unusual for the line to stretch around the block . Once inside , I realize that this is no feel-good , what-can-I-get-you-honey kind of establishment . The white cinder block walls are unadorned . A hand-lettered menu hangs above a long white counter where a half-dozen cashiers buzz around taking and filling orders . Behind them , white-jacketed fry cooks stand over bubbling vats of hot oil , cooking chicken as fast as they can .

All around me , others sit in their cars , radios and air conditioners blasting , delving into their own boxes filled with tater rounds , mayonnaise-based slaw , feather-light hush puppies , and scorch-your-fingers hot chicken . Price 's opened in 1962 to cater to blue-collar workers in the area who had only 30 minutes for lunch . Little has changed , except now it 's as popular with downtown businesspeople as it is with construction and factory workers . 1614 Camden Road , Charlotte ; ( 704 ) 333-9866 . Half-chicken dinner : $6.10 . Kessler 's 1891 Eatery and Pub , Versailles , Kentucky I expected to find dozens of mom-and-pop joints in out-of-the-way places that would vie for the title of best in the South . Not so . Most have gone the way of country stores and full-service gas stations . But this tiny Kentucky town , right in the heart of horse country , claims such a treasure . The chicken dinner comes with a small salad , lackluster green beans , and a baked potato or fries . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Still , the chicken is golden brown , lightly seasoned , and oh-so juicy . Every order comes out steaming hot and cooked to order . Manager Todd Geising , who followed his dream of becoming a Thoroughbred exercise rider to Kentucky , started working at the restaurant just a year and a half ago . The menu features 35 items , including the popular half-pound , handmade hamburgers and the fried chicken . " I put love in every plate of food I make , " Todd says . " That 's really the key to my fried chicken . " 197 Main Street , Versailles , Kentucky ; ( 859 ) 879-3344 . Three-piece chicken dinner : $10.95 . Photograph above : Fiorella 's owner Victor Moran ( right ) , with manager Ron Villegas , marinades his chicken in a blend of " special seasonings ... and stuff . " // Fiorella 's Restaurant , New Orleans When people tell you New Orleans is not known for fried chicken , consider this : The famous Popeyes Chicken &; Biscuit chain started in the Big Easy . Besides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have some fried chicken on the menu . I ate enough in New Orleans to make my belly ache , and still it was a toss-up as to who had the best chicken . But I 'm going to go with Fiorella 's for one simple reason : personality . This crispy bird has a kick to it . It 's not hot enough to make you sweat , but just spicy enough to get your attention . Mashed potatoes with real potato chunks make a perfect pairing . Just across the street from the city 's busy French Market , this local dive has the feel of a little country store . The sloped porch roof looks as if it 's about to fall in . Customers linger on a painted concrete bench out front . Screened front doors stand open in welcome , the oversize menu posted on either side . Inside , a long mural of shrimpboats trolling the coastal waters offers great local color . Though the menu is vast , owner Victor Moran says fried chicken is his best seller . His motto : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he attributes the great taste to a marinade he slyly describes as " special seasonings ... and stuff . " While locals make up the bulk of the customers , Victor says he has some out-of-towners , including several Hollywood types , who make Fiorella 's their last stop so they can savor the flavor before they head home . 45 French Market Place , New Orleans ; ( 504 ) 528-9566 . Four-piece dinner : $8.25 . Seafood &; Chicken Box , Center Point , Alabama It would be easy to overlook this 12-table hole-in-the-wall . It 's tucked into an inconspicuous strip mall in Center Point , a small city on the northeast side of Birmingham . Yet , our very own Editor claims the Seafood &; Chicken Box as his favorite . That 's not the reason I chose it , of course . I picked it because they serve fresh , hot chicken , cooked to order . That , and their secret seasoning . When the platter of chicken arrives at the table , the crispy brown crust glitters as if covered in diamonds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carl and Paul Gagliano , to reveal their secret . " It 's a special herb , " says Carl . " Or it could be a special spice , " says Paul . " Or it could be both , " they say in unison , smiling like Cheshire cats . It 's delicious , and that 's all that really matters . Meals start with a bowl of coleslaw or a house salad , followed by homemade hush puppies and crispy fries or a baked potato . The chicken is exceptionally tender and juicy , yet it features some of the crispiest skin I 've ever eaten . Carl says the egg wash infused with buttermilk makes the skin so tasty . Brotherly love keeps the business running smoothly ; Carl and Paul alternate days so that one of them is always on hand to fry the tasty fowl . Do n't expect to get this chicken in a hurry , no matter which brother is in the kitchen . The menu instructs customers to allow 20 minutes for an order of chicken .
