What a dork ! Peter Parker ( Tobey Maguire ) is behind in his rent , behind in his classwork , doing too many part-time jobs badly  --  and that says nothing about his intimacy problem . It 's dangerous for his beloved Mary Jane Watson ( Kirsten Dunst ) to know he 's Spider-Man , so he has to keep his true , agonized self distant from her yearning heart . Every once in a while , this affects his superheroic night job : he loses the ability to spin the sticky webs that permit him boinging passage through the New York City skies , and  --  splat ! ouch !  --  he tumbles to the concrete . <P> Is this any way to manage a franchise film ? You bet it is . Written primarily by Alvin Sargent ( who the credits indicate had a lot of help ) and directed by Sam Raimi with his heart on his sleeve and his tongue in his cheek , Spider-Man 2 is 1 ) a sequel that 's much better than the original movie and 2 ) probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is because the effects , though handsomely managed , do n't overwhelm the story and characters . <P> The latter include a soulful scientist ( Alfred Molina ) who , having fooled with Mother Nature , is somehow transformed into a great , clanking mechanical octopus ; back from Spidey I , Peter 's spunky , sweet-spirited aunt ( the divine Rosemary Harris ) ; and the meanest newspaper managing editor in movie history ( J.K. Simmons ) . Occasionally , a street singer shows up to croak awful ballads about Spidey 's exploits , and poor Auntie ca n't even get a toaster premium , much less a desperately needed loan , from her bank . <P> That 's the thing about this movie . It takes the time  --  all right , sometimes too much time  --  to meander up paths that are not strictly germane to its main narrative . But mostly that pays off  --  in funny tossed-off lines and quirky situations and a nice warm glow at the end . We 're not dealing with Jamesian complexity here . But we do have something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's unexpectedly full of wit and  --  dare we say it ?  --  intelligence .  --  By Richard Schickel
