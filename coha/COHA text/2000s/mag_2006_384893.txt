SATISFY YOUR INNER IMELDA MARCOS WITH A PAIR , OR 10 , OF THE FINEST ROAD SHOES ON THE MARKET . FROM THE STIFFEST TO THE LIGHTEST TO THE MOST EXPENSIVE TO THE BLINDINGEST , THEY 'RE ALL HERE . // Getting a leg up on the competion starts with the feet : Here are 10 light , fast options . SIDI ERGO 1 DINO SIGNORl LIMITED EDITION Handed down by Mr. Dino Signori-founder of Sidi and inventor of the first cycling shoe with adjustable cleat positioning-this shoe celebrates Sidi 's 30th anniversary . Only 5,000 pairs-swaddled in chrome Lorica and encased in beautiful packaging-were made . Functionally , they 're identical to the Ergo 1 ( $400 ) , only more expensive and more likely to blind you . They 're amazing : incredibly comfortable with a fit like very secure slippers and uppers that are supple from the start . The carbon soles are performance stiff , but not as radically stiff as most high-end shoes . Sidi believes the path to speed is not damn-it-all rigidity but stiff enough , and comfortable .

It 's easily one of the best road racing shoes on the market , and we 're impressed with Specialized 's ability to make a shoe this inflexible that 's also this comfortable . We would liketoseetheM-Lock ratchet of the second-tier Pro carbon shoe replace the unwieldy Boa rotary-andlace closure . If the cant angle of previous BG shoes bugged you , try the new , optional BG footbeds to personalize or eliminate the angle. - Mike Cushionbury PRICE : $275 WEIGHT : 499g/pair ( size 41 ) SIZES : 38-41 ; 46-48 ( whole sizes ) ; 41.545.5 ( half sizes ) CONTACT : specialized.com VITTORIA PREMIUM CARBON HEART The Premium is offered with a choice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sole , a nylon version with a carbon plate in the cleat area . It 's less stiff , slightly thicker and heavier , and $44 less than the full-carbon sole . The Carbon Heart is performance oriented , without the ferocious efficiency of the stiftest carbon soles . Combined with a passionately made , deliciously supple , mediumsnug upper ( a lot like a Sidi with a roomier heel cup ) , it 's a plush shoe that keeps feet happy . Think of it as the perfect complement to a Specialized Roubaix : comfort and speed with no loss of composure. - M.P . PRICE : $235 w/Carbon Heart sole WEIGHT : 626g/pair ( size 41 !

We love the super-thin , full-carbonfiber sole that 's comfortably rigid , and the light , airyfeeling upper . A ratchet and two hook-and-loop Fast Strap SL closures provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little more plushness . The adiStar Ultras were well received by our slenderfooted riders , because the shoes have that narrow . Euro fit. - Ron Koch PRICE : $250 WEIGHT : 59Og/pair ( size 40 ) SIZES : 37-47 ( half sizes ) CONTACT : adidas.com/cycling THE SPECIALIZED S-WORKS CARBON SHOE IS EASILY ONE OF THE BEST ROAD RACING SHOES ON THE MARKET , AND IMPRESSIVELY COMBINES STIFFNESS WITH COMFORT . NORTHWAVE AERATOR Let us introduce the surprisingly roomy Italian shoe . On the foot the Aerator feels a lot like Shimano 's R215B , but with more room in the toe box . A gorgeous shoe , it 's a touch on the heavy side but it 's phenomenally stiff , with a foot-on-the-pedal thin sole . If your motto is " give me speed or give me death , " these are your shoes . Somehow , though , they manage to be more forgiving than we anticipated-perhaps the titanium cage in the sole filters some shock and buzz . Still , these are race performance shoes in all their beautiful , unapologetic glory. - Mf .

At some point he 'll zip up his jersey , then , just before he launches , reach down and ratchet his DMT Flash shoe buckles a bit tighter . And these 580-gram slippers are n't only crazy light , they 're also stiff enough to withstand even Petacchi 's crazy wattage . This is race footwear , though , with the low volume and snug fit that implies . And , because the Flash carbon sole is so indefatigably unbending , your feet may cry for mercy if you wear them on that five-hour club ride . - Michael Frank PRICE : $350 WEIGHT : 5BOg/pair ( size 42.5 ) SIZES : 3750 ; 40.5-45.5 ( half sizes ) CONTACT : uolandso.com PEARL IZUMI OCTANE Pearl 's technology-such as carbon-beamed soles and early use of Boa lacing-and its willingness to take risks ( with roomy toe boxes and bedroomslipperish ( eel ) has always been impressive .
