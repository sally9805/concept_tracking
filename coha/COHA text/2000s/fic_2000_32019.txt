I was about thirteen when I started letting the boys feel me up . There was a whole bunch of them , four or five , and at lunchtime we 'd all meet up ; smoking a spliff out on the pitch if it was sunny , round their table in the library if it was n't . We 'd all be sitting around , eating our lunches , and Joel or Craig or some other boy I did n't really like would start putting his hand up my shirt . Or my skirt , I had a really short skirt and fucking awful legs but I 'd roll the waistband up on it to make it shorter anyway . It was never some big major thing , they just did it while they were talking . I guess my tits were n't as interesting as talking about what makes the best roach material , but they kind of filled the gap between Rizla packets and tape covers . I did n't talk much , just listened to them . Well , everyone listened really , you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't seen the sign on the wall that said SILENCE IS GOLDEN AND THIS LIBRARY IS FOR READING . But then , they did n't really have to pay attention to things like that because they were popular . The tables in the library were arranged so that as many people as possible had to sit with their backs to each other , and they were fixed to the floor so no one could move them . The librarian 's name was Mrs Midwinter , which sounds like something out of Dickens but is n't . Nobody believed she was a Mrs , either she did n't have any wedding ring . She was a very tall woman and her clothes were n't quite tall enough for her body . She had a huge load of grey hair piled up on top of her head and reallypinkcheeks that looked like she 'd been slapped both sides . She was the sort of person that always spoke in a whisper , even when she was shouting . She was new to the school , a replacement for the old librarian , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't in the school then but I heard it happened when someone hacked into the computers so that every time anyone used them they locked out with one single message flashing on the screen . All eight printers going berserk , printing HERBY FUCKS HERSELF WITH A RULER UNDERNEATH THE DESK till they started chewing up the paper . Everyone said Mrs Midwinter was just temporary but I did n't think Miss Herbert would work with children again . I heard from our form tutor that she was a born-again Christian now , but people have funny ways of dealing with things . Maybe that was why they decided to hire Midwinter as a replacement . She looked like your granny on the surface , but I knew she 'd trained with the marines . Even Mrs Midwinter could n't handle our table , though , because our table was n't just five boys . Our table had Holly , and Holly could do what she wanted . Holly was perfect . Long , slim legs , big tits , big mouth , eyes ; everything was big except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of person who warned everyone she was going to fart and gangs of blokes flocked round her , just to get a whiff . Sometimes , while everyone else was talking , she 'd take out this little pocket mirror and lay it on the table , bend over it and spend an hour or so squeezing spots that were n't there . Her face 'd go lumpy and swollen and all puffy when she squeezed , her eyes 'd water . But red and lumpy looked good on Holly . I wished I could be red and lumpy like she was . She hardly ever went out in town . I never did either , but I did n't have a good reason like Holly . Her sister was in university , and she went out to city clubs with her , I heard her talking about it sometimes . Clubs you had to have ID for , clubs you had to be twenty-one for , but all the clubs let Holly in for free . She did n't even have to let the bouncers feel her tits . Holly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I was n't like Holly . I never would be like Holly , so I had to find another way of getting along . I had to let them feel me up . I did n't like doing it but I did n't really hate it either . It 's one of those things you get used to , like bras that cut off the circulation in your nipples . It was necessary . I knew I 'd never really be one of them , they 'd all been friends since they were little so they could tell me to fuck off whenever they wanted . I never kidded myself , I knew that was n't going to change . But I got to be sought after in a funny , dirty kind of way . I got the wolf whistles and the stares . Because I wanted them . And because I was n't the kind of girl you had to like . I was the kind of girl you fucked . Not that I did fuck them , any of them . Things never went that far . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was what they asked for , and I guess it added up to the same . It felt good in a way , though . I wanted to go to school every day , I wanted to hear their cat calls , I wanted to feel their hands . I guess I felt , for the very first time , like I 'd been accepted . I never thought I would be , you see . Things started off badly at High School and I never thought they 'd get better . Things started badly from the very first lesson on my very first day . From the moment that I realized I needed a shit . I was sitting in maths , mid period , they 'd sat us alphabetically so we could all be friends . I went to the front of the room , trying to push my thighs together and still walk in a way that looked near normal . It did n't help . I could tell that they 'd all noticed me by the way the room went silent . Everyone just sitting there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round : there goes a girl who needs a shit . The door sounded very loud when I closed it behind me . The PTA had set up signs in every corridor pointing out the toilets . Only someone had crossed out Toilets on the one in the maths block . They 'd written Shit Holes instead , and I guess I could see why . The whole block had that damp lavatory smell and the concrete was stippled to hold the stains better . One of the cubicle doors was open and I could see toilet paper flowing out of the bowl and over the seat , clogged up , with a tampon on top like a cherry . All the paint was chipped off the doors and none of the locks worked , so that you had to piss with one leg up , holding the door closed , getting piss all over your leg . I headed for the cubicle on the corner , unzipped my fly and took a handful of paper to make a careful circle on the seat . I 'd already let things roll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell ! ' I froze on the toilet seat , halfway to relief . Smells like a dog 's ! ' It is a fucking dog 's ! ' Laughter . And I was only half through . I stared at the door in front of me . Someone had written LEILA FUCKS HORSES on it in Tippex . Smells like hippy shit . ' Hippies smell like that anyway . ' It was still coming . I did n't believe in God , but I prayed then . I prayed it would be quiet . It was n't . Fuck ! There goes another one ! Sounds like a veggie-burger just hit the fan ! ' A hippy burger , you mean . ' They said more than that . A lot more , but I do n't remember much of it . I thought if I waited there in silence long enough they might start to believe they were talking to an empty lavatory . So I sat there , skirt around my midriff , trying to breathe as quietly as I could . Being embarrassed , that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they 'd started , if I 'd made some joke about it , everything would have been Ok . But I was always the sort of person who tried to cover their farts and failed . So I froze . And after about fifteen minutes , the voices stopped . I thought I 'd won ; outwaited them . Either they thought they 'd made a mistake , or they 'd just got bored and left . I wiped . I flushed . I stood up and opened the door . And I came face to face with them . Have a nice shit , hippy ? ' She was blonde , but I did n't really see her face . I walked to the sinks , not looking at them but knowing they were looking at me , and I washed my hands . Hippies should n't be allowed to use the same bogs . ' They stink ' em out for everyone else . ' I thought you liked shitting in the bushes best ? ' I dried my hands on one of those paper towels that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hippy . ' Fuck off back to your caravan . ' I dropped it in the waste basket as I walked away . And I did n't say a word . Dad asked me about my first day just about as soon as he got home , and I 'm not really sure why I lied to him . I was sitting in the kitchen watching Mum make the nut roast when he brought a bag of shopping in , bending through the door . I could tell by the way his breath went up and down that he was tired . Still , he spared a smile for me , sitting down at the kitchen table . Across the room , I heard Mum switch the radio on , and I did n't speak , biting my lip , waiting for him to ask . Christ , ' he said , and pulled his tie out sideways , reaching for the shopping bag . The kitchen light made a little warm spot on his bald patch . So , ' he said . He looked across at me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it go ? ' It was excellent , ' I said . Really ? ' He gave a nod , slow and staring at the table . Good ... ' We did physics . They do n't call it science , right they call it physics . English , art ... ' Uh-huh . And how did that go ? ' What , the art ? Cool . The teacher 's really nice and she let us sit wherever we wanted . We started a self-portrait , right ... ' A self-portrait ? ' He looked up , cracked the can . You did those with me ages ago . ' Yeah ... but she says we 're gon na learn how to do them with perspective . ' We did that too . Last summer . Christ , you know these teachers spend half their time trying to catch up . ' His eyes swapped back to the table . Oh well , ' he said . You 'll know how to do a good job , anyhow . ' He breathed out and I saw him glance behind my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . I thought we 'd probably need some if you 're doing roast . You are doing roast , yeah ? ' Mum nodded , starting from her place by the counter , but I did n't look at her for long . So can I see it then ? ' He took a swig . This self-portrait ? If this teacher 's as crap as she sounds then I 'll still be able to help . ' Help ? ' I looked up at him , and Mum 's arm came down between us . I could see his face was raised to me , his eyebrows kind of hopeful , and I was pretty relieved when Mum said This is Flora . ' She tilted the bottle at him . It 's 50p more expensive , Philip . ' I saw Dad 's mouth open but I got there first . My laugh sounded too loud over the radio . Oh no ! A whole 50p more expensive ? How will we afford it ? Fifty pence ! ' I moved around her arm so he could see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , but Dad did n't answer . I could help you sketch it out tonight , ' he said . Give her a shock next lesson . ' I ... ' I looked down at the table , pressed my lips together . I 'm not sure you 're allowed help in High School . I mean , it 's not that I do n't want you to ... ' Oh . ' I watched him put the can on the table . I see , ' he said . It 's just ... I mean , it would n't be fair , would it ? Me getting help and no one else . ' Right , ' Dad said . He shifted , leaning back quickly as his breath squeezed out . He did n't look at me . No , I can see why . You 're in High School now ... you do n't want Dad looking over your shoulder at everything you do . ' It 's not that . It ... ' But I was n't really sure what it was . 1 kept thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip curled up when she looked at me . It 's a big change after all , ' Dad said . And I knew this would happen . It 's a big move . You 're going to make new friends . You 'll change ... ' He looked at me . Just make sure you do n't change in the wrong direction . ' Make new friends , I thought . Yeah , I 'd certainly done a good job today ; maybe Veggieburger-Shitting Hippy was just a friendly kind of nickname . I bit my lip and looked at Dad but he 'd already turned away . I felt my stomach sink . What are you doing ? ' His voice had got colder , watching Mum 's elbow tilt as she poured oil into the roasting pan . Liz , that 's cold oil for God 's sake . ' She did n't look back at him . I 'm going to put them in in a minute . ' I breathed out while he was looking away from me , rubbed my hand against the grain of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sunk Oh I see sent a sharp thing through my chest . I was n't even sure why I 'd said no . In a minute ? ' Dad said , and his voice had n't got any lighter . So , what : you 're just going to let them lie there in cold oil ? Those are parsnips are n't they ? They 'll get all greasy . ' I would n't have done it if it was going to hurt them , Philip . I 'm going to cook them . ' I looked up at the wall . There 's a cork board up above our kitchen table where Mum used to hang a lot of our pictures , when we were only five or six . She does n't hang so many pictures there these days , though . Which is weird really . We 've got a lot better since then . Only because of Dad 's help , though . He does n't help Michael so much as he helps me , but Michael 's never appreciated his help , that 's what Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought of all those hours he 'd spent , teaching me about cross-hatching and structure . All that time , and after four hours in High School I was giving him the brush-off . Sitting at the table I pressed my ankles together , hard , so that they hurt a little bit . I bit my lip , but still that voice in my head was going round . I thought hippies liked shitting in the bushes best ? And I wondered what that had to do with it . Their voices bounced back and forward , like the ball on that old ping-pong computer game you still see around sometimes , and I picked at a hang-nail on the side of my thumb . I 'd got a nice house . Not a semi-detached in town , but an old school my dad had spent a lot of money on getting converted . It 's quite a way out of town , and in the morning you can hear the birds twittering to each other as well as the traffic from the main road . When Dad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it would be different , it would be wonderful , he said he knew because he had vision , and I guess he was right because it 's got a roof now . It 's not a tepee , or anything . Dad 's spent years trying to get our house just right for us , choosing all the stuff . He bought these great big sliding doors to go right across the front of it , but they 're old and sometimes they get wet inside from all the condensation . Our cat licks the dribbles off when he 's allowed inside . He lives on top of the washing machine in the porch , and he 's got a little box there , full of old blankets and stuff . It smells , but Mum 's always leaving the laundry on top of it anyway . You can tell when it 's been left in the box , the clothes have got hairs all over them and patches of dried dribble . He does n't mean to dribble , our cat , he ca n't help it because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think . It does n't make our house any different from anyone else 's . There 's an ironing board next to the washing machine in our porch , but no one ever irons on it . It 's got cobwebs between the legs from never being moved , and sometimes the cat craps in the gap behind . He knows no one will find it for weeks . I wondered if that blonde girl 'd got an ironing board , and where it was kept in her house . Christ . ' Dad looked round at me . She always does this , you know ? ' I looked up , saw his slight smile settle as I nodded . Seeing that smile I felt something relax in my stomach , something that had tightened without me even noticing . I wished he 'd smile like that more often . You fancy slimy parsnips for dinner ? ' He laughed . Mmmm . Cold and greasy . I bet you ca n't wait . ' I shrugged , measuring my smile exactly as I felt his pick up at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I said quietly . ' I 've got used to them . ' Dad 's eyes only rested on me a moment but it was a good moment . Long enough to take some more of that tightness away . You hear that ? ' he said . She does n't want them covered in cold oil either , Liz . ' Their voices faded away again as Dad 's eyes left me , and the thought of that blonde girl came back . It rose up , like indigestion when you eat too many chips . I wondered if cold greasy parsnips were a hippy thing too . I did n't know , that was the funny thing . I had no idea what made a hippy , what the little differences might be . I tried to think through other people 's houses , work out where that difference lay . Like the newspapers , maybe . Mum keeps those in the porch as well . Hundreds of them , mostly the Guardian and Hello ! Lying on the floor , discarded like that always makes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newspapers she reads and she reads loads . She says you never know when they might come in handy , but I do . I know exactly when they 'll come in handy . When we find the craps behind the ironing board . She gets cross when people use them for that though . They argue about the newspapers , Mum and Dad , because Mum does n't care about our house or all the effort Dad 's put into making it nice for us . He says the newspapers show that . He says people have to come through the porch to get to the house and they have to step over them . He says it gives the wrong impression , and I wondered vaguely what that impression might be . That this house was a hippy house , perhaps . Look , Philip . Are you trying to start an argument ? You trying to piss me off ? ' Are you trying to make a horrible dinner ? ' If you do n't like it , do n't eat it , alright ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do n't give a shit , woman ! That 's your problem ! ' Dad wears suits most of the time , and I never saw a hippy wearing a suit . They look great on him too . He keeps all his clothes in his office , so they never go near the airing cupboard , he says , and I can kind of see why . Do n't tell me how to cook a meal then ! I never interfere with what you 're doing ! When was the last time you cooked a meal for the family ? When ? ' Mum calls it the airing cupboard , even though there 's hardly any air in it . When I was very little and first understood that you were supposed to wear pairs of socks , Mum told me it was the Sock Monster 's fault that I did n't have any . She said it lived in the airing cupboard and I believed her because it looked a bit like a monster 's den . She said the Sock Monster ate socks but never pairs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one blue . She said we were lucky to have a Sock Monster but I do n't think Dad agreed . By the time I lost my frog mittens , the ones with the strings that go through the back of your coat , I did n't believe in the Sock Monster anymore . Sock Monsters do n't eat frog mittens with strings , otherwise they 'd be Sock And Mitten Monsters , I thought . I found a spanner in the airing cupboard once , but it was n't any big surprise . Dad 's workshop was full of old clothes , so it seemed kind of logical . ... Just because you can shout louder , Philip ! Well , I can shout as much as you can ! ' My friends ' dads ' workshops are n't anything like my dad 's , but I do n't see why that would make us hippies . Theirs are always small and usually part of the garage , and all the tools hang up on neat little pegs on the walls . Sometimes they 're even labelled , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their own boxes a place for everything and everything in its place . Work clothes hang up on pegs on the walls , aprons and gloves and stuff like that . Dad 's workshop 's different . It has pegs and shelves around the walls too but Dad never bothers with them , he just uses the floor . You 're the one who 's shouting , Liz . You 're just fucking uptight tonight . ' There used to be a chair , somewhere inside the shed , that Mum asked him to reupholster for her sister 's wedding present , but she got divorced before he could do it , and even though they 're back together now , we have n't found it since . None of that stuff ever changes , though . It 's always been that way , like Dad helping me with my art . And watching Mum stand there , her face scrunched red against the background wall , I clenched my teeth together . I was in a great mood till you came in ! And if I 'm uptight it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is cook you a meal ! You can cook it your fucking self if you want ! ' Cook it yourself ... Thanks Liz . Thanks for a really nice dinner . I will cook it myself . And it wo n't taste like shit either . ' FUCK YOU ! ' Yeah , ' Dad nodded , but his smile was kind of sad . Fuck you too , love , ' he said . ' It 's so nice coming home . ' Dad kind of collapsed as Mum left the room . I watched him flop down on to the table , try to smile as he looked up at me . I 'm sorry , ' I said . He shrugged , looked vaguely round the kitchen . Great welcome , ' he said . I could n't think of anything to answer though , anything to make it better . I looked at Dad 's face and I wished he 'd smile again . Do n't change in the wrong direction , I thought . But I could n't even work out which direction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll sort itself out , ' I said . Always does . ' Yeah ... ' But his eyes did n't look any better , staring at me as he said I 'm glad you had a good time anyway . ' Mmm , ' I said . A good time . I 'd tried , I really had . Tried to have a good time , tried to say hello to people , all that stuff that you 're supposed to do . I 'd just failed . Funny really , I did n't even understand why . And , watching Dad 's attempt at a smile slip further down his face , I drew a breath in , bit my lower lip . Well , ' I said . Maybe ... maybe if you still want to , you could help me with my picture . Yeah ? '
