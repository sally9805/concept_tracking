Goldberg is a witty welcome surprise on both the big and small screens-on top at the box office and in the center Hollywood Square . An actress who in 1990 earned her industry 's top honor , the Oscar , the former welfare mom also knows what life 's like when you lose it all . She 's been a bright light in the lives of the nation 's homeless through her work as a cohost of the annually televised Comic Relief benefit . Whoopi 's got courage , and she 's got it in spades . Angela Bassett , DRAMATIC ACTRESS Laurence Fishburne put it this way : Angie B. is a bad mother ... " Shut your mouth . Somebody record her a sound track , because she 's our superhero on the big screen . We 've been feeling her since she brought fever to Broadway in August Wilson 's brilliant Ma Rainey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tina Turner or a character from Shakespeare , we believe her instantly . Yale School of Drama training did n't rob the actress of her sisterly touch-that cool conviction , trace of pain , hint of hope . She 's a class act ; her name and her talent put any production a notch up . Iyanla Vanzant , Photograph // AUTHOR AND SPIRITUAL TEACHER Her words heal us . From Tapping the Power Within to In the Meantime to Yesterday 1 Cried and at least seven other titles , this prolific author walks side by side with us along the path to self discovery .

Later , as a widow rearing three children on welfare , she started college . She went on to become an attorney a college administrator and a fervent believer in the transforming power of God .

She poured herself into math , biology and chemistry and went on in 1973 to become the first African-American woman in the States ever to earn a physics Ph.D. - from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , no less . She was also the first Black and first woman to head the nations Nuclear Regulatory Commission in 1995 .

That her seven novels , from The Bluest Eye ( 1970 ) to Paradise ( 1998 ) , well up within us , overspill our souls and send us wading into deep pools of wonder ? The answer , mysteriously enough , is right there on every page . In her earlier career as a book editor in the 1970 's , she shepherded others , helping to bring forth powerful works by Angela Davis , Toni Cade Bambara and Gayl Jones . Nobels and Pulitzers can only hint at the prize Toni Morrison is . D Anna Deavere Smith , ACTRESS AND PLAYWRIGHT Her acclaimed one-woman plays hold up a mirror to our society 's pockmarked face . Seeking to understand and capture the American character , she likes to interview a cross section of people whose lives were all touched by the same explosive event . Then she brings dozens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nuance during a sigle evening 's performance . The art of this Stanford professor and actress cuts close to life . For instance , in Fires in the Mirror , a play about what happens to a New York City community after a Jewish man accidentally kills a Black boy , she played everyone from an Orthodox rabbi to a rapper , from a Brooklyn Hasidic housewife to the Reverend Al Sharpton . She demonstrated the same artistry , range and acuity in her second original stage drama , Twilight , playing many of the people who witnessed or felt the impact of the 1992 Los Angeles uprising after the Rodney King verdict .

This first woman Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee has collected more than a dozen Grammy Awards , including a special one for lifetime achievement . Forever we will walk with her in our hearts because she is , in a word , peerless . Briana Scurry , Photograph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple of natural disasters helped unleash this force of nature : First a hurricane destroyed the family home in Texas , then an underground lake slurped up another in Minnesota . The Scurry clan moved yet again to suburban Minneapolis , where at age 9 Briana saw a flyer for soccer-club tryouts . Though she was just kickin ' it , it turned out that she had game . She has been the U.S. number-one goalkeeper since 1994 and in 1996 brought home the gold as a part of the U.S. Women 's National Team at the Olympics . " Playing against Briana is like rock-climbing a slab of marble , " says a former coach . In other words , do n't even try it . Naomi Campbell , SUPERMODEL Since Eve and her man got tossed out of Eden , women have been futzing around with fashion . But few have taken it to the level of high art that London  --  born Naomi Campbell has .

Pinn , M.D. As director of the Office of Research on Women 's Health at the National Institutes of Health , she recently led a national effort to reexamine priorities for women 's health for the twenty-first century .

Now that 's good medicine . Beverly J. Harvard , POLICE CHIEF , ATLANTA In this era of racial profiling , few suspected that Beverly J. Harvard  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ become Atlanta 's police chief Way back when , even her- husband had doubts that she could make it to the first rung , because she was n't at all physically intimidating . Today the 27-year vet heads a force of about 2,300 officers with a budget of more than $100 million , and she manages crises like the 1996 Olympic Park bombing with ease . As the first African-American woman to head a major city police department , Harvard shines like polished brass . Jennifer Smith , BERMUDA 'S PREMIER The waves in Bermuda are n't all at the beach . Recently elected premier , Jennifer Smith caused a riptide when she toppled one of the world 's longest-serving governments on the 22. i-square-mile island .

She is perhaps best known as a novelist for the award-winning best-seller Sally Herrings ( 1979 ; a new edition was published this year by St. Martin 's Press ) , which captured the complicated truth about the bond and the babies between Thomas Jefferson and his enslaved mistress , Sally . Jeffersonians originally denied that this relationship existed , but DNA does n't lie . Among her monumental sculptures are the 1970 series dedicated to Malcolm X and Africa Rising , two tons and 18 feet of cast bronze commissioned as a memorial for the African burial ground in lower Manhattan .

Meanwhile , she 'll teach you moves a la Backstreet Boys and Aaliyah via her fitness home-video release , Go Fatima ( Buena Vista ) . Faith Ringgold , VISUAL ARTIST AND AUTHOR One of her glorious story quilts graces the permanent collection of New York City 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public alike are drawn to the magical dash of fantasy and frayed threads of reality that she stitches into each work . With delicious titles like " Dancing at the Louvre , " " Tar Beach " and Aunt Harriet 's Underground Railroad in the Sky , " she arrests you first with a beautiful , surreal image and then borders it with patches of fabric on which her amazingly inventive stories are written . Many speak to issues of race , gender and family . Ringgold writes and illustrates children 's books on those same subjects-like My Dream of Martin Luther King , If a Bus Could Talk : The Story of Rosa Parks and The Invisible Princess , among others-but with such a gossamer touch that children sit still and listen . Terry McMillan , BEST SELLING AUTHOR Terry McMillan 's enormously popular novels Waiting to Exhale and How Stella Got Her Groove Back in the 1990 's first made Black readers and film audiences truly visible to the industry powers that he .

Lynn Harris and Eric Jerome Dickey-who have found careers in a new genre of Black commercial fiction . The hallmarks of McMillan 's own work are her down-to-earth , upwardly mobile Black women characters and salty dialogue-driven plots that keep it real . Despite her celebrity seven-figure publishing advances and Hollywood adaptations of her novels , McMillan identifies herself primarily as a working writer , not a star , and labors behind the scenes with the National Book Foundation , sponsors of the National Book Award , so even more writers of color get their props from the American literary mainstream .
