SMART people eat smart and live longer . Instead of living to eat , they eat to live , giving greater zest to both the eating and the living . Since time immemorial , since the days of pyramids and before , smart-eating and smart-living Brothers and Sisters have consciously ( or unconsciously ) followed the time-tested dieting plan of balancing the food groups . A healthy diet provides the right balance of carbohydrates , fats , proteins , vitamins , minerals and water to keep the body running and to reduce the risk of chronic diseases . The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Health and Human Services have codified this principle in the Food Guide Pyramid , which shows at a glance the proportions of each food group that should supply all the nutrients in the amounts needed by most people over the age of 2 . The pyramid is not a precise prescription but a basic guide that suggests a range of servings , depending on your caloric needs and your taste . At the base of the Foods Guide Pyramid are the grains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pyramid recommends daily consumption of 6 to 11 servings of grains , which supply many minerals , including iron , as well as B vitamins , complex carbohydrates and dietary fiber . There are many different types of grain products in most grocery stores . That 's why it is important to read labels before making your selections . Many of these products are high in calories and sodium but not high in nutritional value . Also watch out for fat content , and keep in mind that you negate the nutritional value of lower-calorie foods when you pile on butter , margarine , mayonnaise and other fatty additions . The next level on the Food Guide Pyramid contains vegetables and fruits . The pyramid recommends that we eat three to five servings of vegetables and two to four servings of fruits each day . Vegetables provide vital nutrients such as folic acid , vitamin C , iron , potassium and magnesium . Quite a few also are packed with vitamin A , and all contain fiber and are low in calories . Like vegetables , fruits also are rich in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitamin C , which is abundant in citrus fruits , melons and strawberries . In addition to being packed with nutrients , most fruits are low in calories . Vegetables and fruits are an excellent snack food , especially when eaten raw . Fresh produce ( fruits and vegetables ) is best when eaten as close as possible to its peak of freshness . Produce that sits in the refrigerator for a week or more will lose a substantial portion of nutritional content . This is especially true for vegetables such as broccoli and spinach . The next level includes the dairy group ( milk , yogurt , cheese and ice cream ) as well as meat , poultry , fish , dried beans and nuts . The dairy group includes all milk products except butter . Two to three servings from this group are recommended by the Food Pyramid . Keep in mind that it is difficult for the average American to consume enough calcium without including milk or cheese in his or her diets . Dairy products also supply a variety of other minerals , such as nutritionally complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , vitamin D ( usually added to milk ) and many of the B vitamins . The down side is that many dairy foods are high in fat . When selecting from the dairy group , choose foods that are lower in fat . The protein food group includes meat , poultry , fish , dry beans , eggs and nuts . The Food Pyramid recommends two to three servings of protein foods a day . These foods supply protein , most B complex vitamins and several minerals such as iron . Like those in the dairy group , some of these foods may be high in fat and should be eaten in moderation . A serving of meat is 3 ounces , about the size of a deck of cards . When selecting from the meat and protein group , choose lean cuts of meat and skinless poultry to cut down on the fat . Some people choose vegetarian diets due to their culture , personal beliefs or for health reasons . Vegetarian diets are consistent with the guidelines and can provide the recommended dietary allowance for nutrients . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the variety and amounts of foods consumed are adequate . Vegetarians should make sure they are consuming enough iron , zinc , and B vitamins , especially since these nutrients are primarily found in meat , fish and poultry . In addition , those consuming vegetarian diets , particularly children , should take care to ensure they get adequate amounts of vitamin D and calcium . At the tip of the Food Guide Pyramid are fats , oils and sweets , and it is recommended that you eat them sparingly . Salad dressings , gravies , sauces and condiments are included in this group , as are margarine , butter and cooking oils . The foods in this group generally contribute to taste and texture , but are relatively low in nutritional value and high in calories . This is the area to cut back if you have a problem with weight . Eating a variety of foods is key to maintaining good health because no single food or food group can supply all the nutrients in the amounts your body needs . For example , oranges provide vitamin C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no vitamin C. You also should choose a variety of foods within each food group , because foods within the same group have different combinations of nutrients and other vital ingredients . For good health , eat more grain products , vegetables and fruits . Eat dry beans , lentils and peas more often . Increasing fiber intake is beneficial for proper digestive and bowel function and can reduce symptoms of chronic constipation . The antioxidant nutrients found in plant foods currently are of great interest to scientists because of their potential beneficial role in reducing the risk for cancer and other chronic diseases . Also , keep in mind that minerals such as potassium , which is found in some vegetables and fruits , and calcium may help reduce the risk for high blood pressure . Remember to choose lean and low-fat foods most often and monitor the amount of salt you use . It is recommended that you consume 2,400 mg of sodium per day ; that is about one level teaspoon of salt . Most people consume much more than this amount , especially when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to balance the food you eat with physical activity . Do n't forget to drink water . It is recommended that you drink at least eight glasses ( 64 ounces ) of water each day . Water is very important to your health , since the body is composed mostly of water . Water is crucial-to every function of the body . It aids in transporting nutrients and waste products in and out of cells . It is also needed for the maintenance of proper body temperature . Remember , you are what you eat . Eating healthy foods helps the body to function properly and to reduce the possibility of contracting certain diseases . You determine what you put into your body , so try to put in good fuel so that your body will operate at its best . You 'll feel better . // ESSENTIAL VITAMINS Sidebar Serving Sizes For Food Groups In The FOOD GUIDE PYRAMID Sidebar BREAD , CEREALS , RICE , AND PASTA ( 6 to 11 servings each day ) 1 slice of bread 1 cup ready-to-eat cereal 1/2 cup cooked cereal 1/2 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taco shells 1 4-inch pancake 3 cups air-popped popcorn Sidebar VEGETABLES ( 3 to 5 servings each day ) 1/2 cup cooked or raw vegetables 1 cup leafy , raw vegetables 1 small baked potato 1 medium tomato 1/2 cup potato salad or coleslaw Sidebar FRUITS ( 2 to 4 servings each day ) 1 medium piece of fruit or melon wedge 1/2 grapefruit 1/2 cup berries or grapes 6 ounces juice 1/2 cup canned fruit 1/4 cup dried fruit Sidebar MILK , CHEESE AND YOGURT ( 2 to 3 servings each day ) 1 cup milk or yogurt 2 ounces cheese 1/2 cup cottage or ricotta cheese 1/2 cup ice cream or frozen yogurt Sidebar MEAT , POULTRY , FISH , DRY BEANS , EGGS , AND NUTS ( 2 to 3 servings each day ) 3 ounces cooked lean meat , poultry or fish 1/2 cup cooked beans 1 egg 2 tablespoons peanut butter 1/3 cup nuts 1/2 cup tofu FATS , OILS AND SWEETS ( use sparingly ) // <p>                   @ @
