Chapter One It 's dark in that awful way that allows you to make out objects but not the black spaces behind them . My breathing comes ragged from exertion and fear . The only person I trust in the world lies on the floor beside me . I lean into him and hear that he 's still breathing but it 's shallow and hard won . He 's hurt , I know . But I ca n't see how badly . I whisper his name in his ear but he does n't respond . I feel his body but there 's no blood that I can tell . The sound of his body hitting the floor minutes before was the worst thing I 've ever heard . I feel the floor around him , looking for his gun . After a few seconds I feel the cool metal beneath my fingertips and I almost weep with relief . But there 's no time for that now . I can hear the rain falling outside the burned-out building , its loud , heavy drops smacking on canvas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gaping holes in the roof down through floors of rotted wood and broken staircases . He moves and issues a low groan . I hear him say my name and I lean in close to him again . " It 's okay . We 're going to be okay , " I tell him , even though I do n't have any reason to believe this is true . Somewhere outside or up above us a man I thought I loved , along with other men whom I could n't identify , are trying to kill us , to protect an awful truth that I 've discovered . I am hurt myself , in so much pain that I might pass out if I did n't know it meant dying here in this condemned building on the Lower East Side of Manhattan . There 's something embedded in my right thigh . It 's possibly a bullet , or a large spike of wood , or maybe a nail . It 's so dark I can just barely see the large hole in my jeans , and the denim is black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tilting , but I 'm holding on . I hear them up above us now , see the beams of their flashlights crossing in the dark through the holes in the floors . I try to control my breathing , which to my own ears sounds as loud as an oncoming train . I hear one of the men say to the others , " I think they fell through . They 're on the bottom . " There was no answer but I can hear them making their way down over creaking wood . He stirs . " They 're coming , " he says , his voice little more than a rasp . " Get out of here , Ridley . " I do n't answer him . We both know I 'm not leaving . I pull at him and he tries to get up , but the pain registers on his face louder than the scream I know he suppressed to protect us for a few minutes more . If we 're not walking out of here together , we 're not walking out at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be moving him , over behind an old moldy couch that lies on its back by the wall . It 's not far but I can see his face white and gritted in terrible pain . As I move him , he loses consciousness again and in an instant feels fifty pounds heavier . But I 've seen all four of his limbs move and that 's something . I realize that I 'm praying as I pull him , my leg on fire , my strength waning . Please God , please God , please God , over and over again like a mantra . The way the couch is lying , it forms a crawl space against the wall just big enough for the two of us . I pull him in there and lie on my belly beside him . I pull an old crate over toward the edge of the couch and look through the wooden slats . They 're closer now and I 'm sure they 've heard us because they 've stopped talking and turned their flashlights off . I hold the gun in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun before and I do n't know how many bullets are left in this one . I think we 're going to die here . " Ridley , please , do n't do this . " The voice echoes in the dark and comes from up above me . " We can work this out . " I do n't answer . I know it 's a trick . Nothing about this can be worked out now ; we 're all too far gone . There have been plenty of chances to close my eyes and go back to the sleep of my life as it was , but I have n't taken any of them . Do I wish now that I had ? It 's hard to answer that question , as the wraiths move closer . " Six , " he whispers . " What ? " " You have six bullets left . " ( Continues ... )
