The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 hijacks a ' 70s vision of down-and-out New York . New York City has provided the world with many disquieting visions over the years but few more surprising than the sight of Denzel Washington in The Taking of Pelham 1 2 3 . Sitting at a subway dispatcher 's console , the usually impeccable movie hero looks puffy and has a gut you could park a Hummer on . Weighing in at a sedentary 220 lb. , he 's playing a desk jockey burdened by the usual bureaucratic bull plus a scandal that has put his career in the commode . And now , on the other end of the line , he 's got a chatty psychopath ( John Travolta ) who just hijacked a Pelham local and wants $10 million , cash , in an hour flat -- or he 'll commence killing his passenger-hostages , one a minute . Directed by Tony Scott ( Top Gun , Deja Vu ) with his usual gusto and a few too many circling camera movements , this conventionally compelling movie is packed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticking toward certain doom , the runaway train , the ordinary man tapped for a suicidal mission . It 's based on the John Godey novel and the 1974 film version , The Taking of Pelham One Two Three , with Walter Matthau as the transit cop and Robert Shaw as the hijacker . Both movies speak volumes about the state of the entertainment industry , then and now . In the mid- ' 70s , near bankruptcy and a soaring murder rate had made New York City the poster child for urban dystopia , and Hollywood , which at the time was actually interested in reflecting contemporary society , turned out a raft of films -- Serpico , Death Wish , Dog Day Afternoon , Taxi Driver -- that navigated that stinky Styx . Pelham was one of those gritty exposs , and a tarnished time capsule of Gotham crime , sludge and cynicism . ( " What the hell do they expect for their lousy 35 ? " a city employee says of the subway hostages . " To live forever ? " ) Resilience too : Matthau is as wily as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they ca n't give a lot of lip back to their captors . Today the subway fare is $2 , and New York , which has the lowest crime rate of any large U.S. city , is the center of another national trauma : the financial crisis . In one sense , the new Pelham ( written by Brian Helgeland , who won an Oscar for his L.A. Confidential script ) has a stethoscope to that malaise when it alludes to the toxicity of insider trading . There 's also a superrich mayor ( James Gandolfini ) who could be an outsize Michael Bloomberg . But most of the film takes place in a fantasy present , where the Dow is at 11,000 -- a relic of that halcyon era , i.e. , last year , when the movie was shot . And a congestion of cars , arranged as carefully as clusters of Rockettes , is n't traffic ; it 's just the backdrop for a spectacular crash . Washington 's constricted calm is a smart contrast to the manic Travolta , who 's channeling his strutting killer from Face/Off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it might as well be Pelham , an action film where the tension is conveyed mainly in phone calls , and it ought to work as efficiently as this one . But would n't it be nice , once in a while , for Hollywood to turn contemporary traumas into vigorous movies instead of hijacking the anxieties of the past ?
