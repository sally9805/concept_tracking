Blame it on the French . More than any other people , they have promoted the notion that the taste of a food is inextricably bound to the place where it is grown . As early as the 1920s , France 's winemakers were restricting use of the term Bordeaux to wines produced in that area . In 1974 they engineered an international treaty that declared that only bubbly from the Champagne region could be labeled champagne , forcing other producers of sparkling wines ( including vintners in Champagne , Switzerland ) to scramble for synonyms like methode champagnoise . <P> Now , though , the French idea is catching on worldwide , as the latest tool of those who would protect their regional agriculture and aquaculture from competition . Audacious producers are claiming virtual trademarks on everything from catfish , herring and scallops to certain varieties of rice and onions . <P> In November , President George W. Bush signed a one-year provision declaring that only bottom feeders raised in the U.S. could be sold as catfish . Legislation to make the ban permanent passed the Senate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure was specifically aimed at competition from Vietnamese farmers who raise a variety of catfish in flooded rice paddies and sell them for attractive prices : about $1.80 a lb. wholesale , vs. $2.80 for U.S.-farmed catfish . Called basa , the Vietnamese fish account for about 20% of catfish fillets sold in the U.S. , up from 7% in 1997 . " These fish are being pawned off as catfish to unsuspecting American consumers , " argued Arkansas Senator Tim Hutchinson , who co-sponsored the legislation against basa , and whose state happens to be a major site of catfish farming . " With names such as Delta Fresh , no one would suspect it is from the Mekong Delta . " <P> Never mind that ichthyologists have found that U.S. catfish and Vietnamese basa are virtually indistinguishable genetically . Never mind that importers of basa defy anyone in a blind taste test to distinguish their product from U.S. catfish . This battle is n't about science or succulence so much as it is about politics and commerce . <P> Before the catfish flap , Americans from several Southern states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onions known as Vidalia Sweets . Originally grown near the town of Vidalia , Ga. , these onions soon were cultivated elsewhere from Vidalia onion seeds . A 1986 Georgia law says onion growers in only 20 of the state 's 159 counties can label their produce Vidalia . Violators are fined by the state 's commissioner of agriculture . <P> Like rice with your onions ? Get ready for another food fight . India wants to prevent the U.S. from selling its products as basmati rice , the fluffy , long-grained variety traditionally associated with South Asian cuisine . India has vehemently protested a 1997 U.S. patent granted to a Texas-based company called RiceTec for a genetically engineered variety of basmati developed in the U.S. India 's rice crusade won support from demonstrators at the World Trade Organization conference in Seattle last year . And India even achieved rare solidarity with its regional foe , Pakistan , which also exports basmati rice .
