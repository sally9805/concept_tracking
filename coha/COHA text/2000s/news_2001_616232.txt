<p> Trauma of traffic A metrowide poll on our snarled roads spurs readers to offer solutions . <p> Police escort would make commute calmer <p> Regarding the traffic problems in metro Atlanta ( " We 're playing catch-up , " @issue , May 6 ) : Neither mass transit , additional road building nor telecommuting will fix the area 's traffic problems short term . Here 's an idea that could work short term , however . <p> Because Atlanta 's drivers ca n't be trusted to maintain an even and safe speed along the interstates  --  which would alleviate many of our problems on the road  --  perhaps the city could coordinate some sort of timed escort by the police along Ga . 400 , I-75 and I-85 and force commuters to maintain a safe and steady speed . This would create a calm and much faster commute . <p> In a nutshell , it 's better to travel at 40 mph during an entire commute than to travel 80 mph for the first portion of a commute and 5 mph the rest of the trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlanta and the North Georgia mountains . <p> Expanding MARTA lines will attract commuters <p> Atlanta can not build its way out of the traffic ( and pollution ) nightmare we find ourselves in . Anybody who has ever lived in Los Angeles can tell you that . <p> The answers to Atlanta 's traffic and air problems are in expanding MARTA rail lines into Cobb and Gwinnett counties and building large park-and-ride facilities along the rail line so that commuters can easily and quickly get downtown or to the northern Perimeter area . <p> People may say that they wo n't use it , but cities such as Chicago have proven otherwise . When it costs more time and money to commute and park downtown , people will use rail . And that includes me . We already have enough lanes of freeway and enough " Smog Alert " days . It is time to try something new . KEVIN KITCHEN , Austell <p> Driving is n't only way to get around Atlanta <p> I have no sympathy for those who incessantly complain about Atlanta 's traffic while simultaneously creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be considered before jumping to the conclusion that the only way to alleviate traffic is to build more roads . <p> Ride a bike , walk , use public transportation and if you must drive , car pool . The benefits to the environment and your health gained from leaving your car home will far outweigh the short-term convenience of driving . ERIC DRUMMER , Atlanta <p> Speed leads to plague of accidents , which slows traffic even further <p> All too familiar , but still appalling , to have to read again about our plight here in metro Atlanta . Sure , we need to explore alternatives to the use of automobiles for commuting to alleviate the congestion , but what about for now ? <p> Most of us can handle the daily crawl , but the real crushing blow comes from the delays caused by accidents . Even the slightest accident can virtually halt traffic in its tracks . Most of these are caused by excessive speed . <p> Offenders generally pay higher insurance rates , but apparently with a booming economy and high per capita income in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterrent . Any ideas other than initiating a greater presence of law enforcement vehicles ? That in itself might work . MICHAEL SARRIS , Acworth <p> Adjust traffic lights to save fuel , frustration <p> There appears to be a lack of appreciation for the loss of time caused by improperly timed traffic lights . Growth has increased the amount of signals on many commuting routes , but my own observation of the timing ( amount of green vs. red in proportion to the cross-flow direction ) suggests significant relief by just adjusting the timing ratios . <p> Also , the wait for green arrows to change when there are no vehicles in a left-turn lane consumes more idling time . It is very frustrating to wait at a red light along with up to 30 or so cars while only a few vehicles  --  or none  --  need the green light for the cross flow . This not only exacerbates the traffic jams but increases the fuel and pollution problems . <p> Forget about all the consultants from around the country and just focus in on a simple approach to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't let extremists hold highway projects hostage <p> The Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll indicated that the most urgent need for improvement in the metro area is traffic . Yet the Sierra Club and other environmental extremists continue their legal actions to stop any increase in highway capacity in metro Atlanta . <p> The Sierra Club is suing our local , state and federal planning agencies and the Environmental Protection Agency . If it is successful , improvements will never be made to address traffic at Hartsfield International Airport ; on Ga . 400 ; on Peachtree at Piedmont , Ashford-Dunwoody and Windy Hill roads ; or on hundreds of other roads . <p> A report by Texas A &M; University said a mix of investments in highways and mass transit is the best method to address congestion . Atlanta 's 25-year Regional Transportation Plan has such a mix . <p> Atlanta ca n't let a small , special-interest group dictate our quality of life . Everyone should contact the Sierra Club and tell it to drop its lawsuit . If not , Atlanta 's future economic vitality will surely suffer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Transportation . <p> City must meet water standards <p> The editorial on Atlanta 's sewers left some very wrong impressions for the decision-making public during the 2001 elections ( " City 's sewer woes will cause a big stink , " @issue , May 6 ) . <p> Yes , there has been deferred maintenance , but some of the cost overruns and delays and fines have happened because the city has walked a tightrope between demands from our vocal residents and trying to comply with Clean Water Act standards . <p> In 1994 , Atlanta halted a $20 million design for waste-water improvement because some residents did not like the chosen technology . We were fined by the state and sued by other environmental groups , and now we are dealing with a federal consent decree because of that lawsuit . If we were to miss the consent decree deadline of 2007 , we would have no credibility . <p> The entire state is looking to Atlanta to follow through in its commitments to comply with the Clean Water Act . Our next mayor needs to be thinking about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commitment . I believe this should be the talk on the campaign trail , not which technology to use for Clean Water Act compliance . CLAIR MULLER Muller chairs the City Utilities Committee of the Atlanta City Council . <p> ' LITTLEST REBEL ' : It 's nice to see positive story about honoring history <p> I just want to thank The Atlanta Journal-Constitution for the beautiful article about the little Rebel ( " The littlest Rebel , " Living , May 6 ) . <p> It 's a refreshing difference to read an inspiring article about Southerners who honor their history and their ancestors . SANDRA WHITTINGTON , Douglasville <p> Little Jonathan will always be with us <p> I wonder how many Sunday readers passed by the photo of Jonathan Maxey standing next to a Confederate battle flag and quickly turned the page , their sports scores and stock reports beckoning . <p> Little Jonathan is not dead . He walks still by a church named Shiloh and has fished at Stones River ; he was there with the Georgians at Burnside Bridge . His spirit waves to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walks in front of us , calling to us to hurry up and see what he has discovered . <p> My loss is that I never knew him until Sunday morning . DAN HILLS , Stockbridge <p> Nuclear energy represents only feasible alternative <p> Regarding the recent discussions on nuclear energy : I for one am disappointed that the heady optimism of the 1950s about nuclear energy was never realized . To those who maintain that fossil fuels can be made cleaner and more efficient , I would remind them that even with more and more exploration , and even with a willingness to destroy the habitats where these fuels may be found , fossil fuels are ultimately a nonrenewable resource . In other words , some day we will run out of oil and gas . <p> Technologies such as wind and solar power offer some possibilities , but nuclear power is , in the long run , the only realistic solution for generating electrical power . So let 's get on with it and learn how to build safe nuclear power facilities and dispose of the waste products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The slanted , mean-spirited article on conservatism was completely devoid of any journalistic quality whatsoever ( " Compassionate not same as passionate with conservatives , " @issue , May 6 ) . I guess the whole concept of being neutral and unbiased is no longer a requirement for responsible journalism . All one need do is find a publication that is willing to be a mouthpiece for one 's own political and personal leanings . <p> Had an evil conservative written such a vitriolic piece of schlock with such off-color and completely false examples of what liberals supposedly believe , would you have printed it ? STEPHANIE SALB , Buford <p> Coverage of Music Midtown takes away from other arts <p> I read with a complete sense of mystery the special section devoted to Music Midtown . Why so much coverage ? <p> Far more exciting and diverse happenings in the literary , visual and performing arts take place daily  --  and on a sustained basis throughout the year  --  that go begging for attention , despite your editors ' excellent efforts in other sections . <p> Does 95,000 people standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top-shelf bands , an event essentially re-created in cities across the country , warrant this much coverage ? I do n't think so . TOM PAYTON Payton is a book publisher in Athens . <p> PRESIDENT BUSH : Diversify letters by adding more voices of support <p> I see in Sunday 's Letters section that The Atlanta Journal-Constitution had received 1,471 total reader responses in the previous week ( @issue , May 6 ) . I would hope the editors could find one or two letters in defense of President Bush . Ignoring the fact that most letters criticizing the president are repeating the erroneous claims of previous letters or Democratic strategists on TV shows , I feel it is equally important to print a diversity of opinion . JOHNEY FRIAR , Auburn <p> Attacks have taken on a hysterical tone lately <p> In recent weeks , some of the letters published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution regarding President Bush have taken on a decidedly hysterical tone . On May 6 , we read how Bush has done absolutely nothing right , and deserves a generous " low F " ( " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , May 6 ) . We can read in another letter that surely one can only support defending the nation against ballistic missiles either from stupidity , greed or conspiracy ( " Missiles out of date for nuclear delivery , " @issue , May 6 ) . <p> Finally , the masterpiece from Sunday lurches into self-parody ( " President arrogantly takes us backward , " @issue ) . A letter chock full of righteous certitude contains a quotation to the effect that only fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves . This was priceless . BILL BROCKMAN , Atlanta <p> Skandalakis ' concerns come much too late <p> So Mitch Skandalakis says his life has gone down the drain ( " Skandalakis says probe sent life ' down the drain , ' " Metro , May 6 ) ? <p> Perhaps Skandalakis should have thought about what repercussions might have come about before he committed any questionable actions , not after . LYN ROOT , Lawrenceville <p> Remember mothers who have lost a child <p> Reflecting on the Mother 's Days throughout my life , I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mother 's Day is an especially difficult time for these women , whose only kiss from their child is a gentle breeze across their cheek , their only hug is sunlight warming their face , and their gift is the love of that child wrapped in memories . <p> This year on Mother 's Day , cherish each treasured moment with your child ; ask your minister to remember those who have lost children when they honor mothers ; call a friend or acquaintance who has lost a child just to say , " I am thinking of you . " One of the most beautiful gifts you can give a surviving parent is to remember their child . RENE WILLIAMS Williams , an Atlanta nurse , survives a son , William W.
