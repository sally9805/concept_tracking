It was a splendid morning to play Woodburn Golf Club in northwest Oregon  --  the weeds sprouting tall on the shaggy tee boxes , puddles shimmering on the grassless greens . Bruce Manclark propped his Top-Flite on a muddy tuft of turf and banged a 3-wood up the fairway . Or was it the rough ? At Woodburn , there 's no telling .  --  The ground squished underfoot from a late-night downpour . The smell of chicken manure , wafting over from a nearby farm , hung so thickly in the breeze you could almost taste it . It was cold enough to see your breath . Manclark 's playing partner , Al , a gray-haired retiree who 'd turned up as a single , waggled his outmoded TaylorMade driver . His shot sailed wildly right into a plowed dirt field , beyond a row of hand-painted NO TRESPASSING signs . " Uh-oh , that 's shotgun golf , " Al mutters . " Farmer over there 's got a shotgun . " Manclark grinned . " It does n't get any better than this , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustachioed 48-year-old with the lean build of a man who always totes his own bag , has also had the pleasure of a round on an Alaskan course so freshly carved from an overgrown hayfield that its owner was still baling the fairways as Manclark bushwhacked through . And he 's taken his hacks at another Oregon nine-holer where boots are recommended to guard against goose droppings . Golf the Bruce Manclark way is played like that . On cow-patty covered fairways infested by rodents . On sand greens . Without caddies , carts or marshals . Without fuss or formality . Let other players make the pilgrimage to Pebble Beach . Manclark will take his lumps at courses like Woodburn , 30 minutes south of Portland , or any of the rough-hewn natural wonders posted on his Web site , pasturegolf.com . " If you think about it , " says Manclark , " this is the way golf was meant to be . " Too disorganized to be an organization and not feverish enough to be a movement , Pasture Golf is the outgrowth of one man 's firmly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwritten commandments : Thou shalt shy away from dress codes . Thou shalt scrimp and save on greens fees . Thou shalt stick to courses that you would n't know were courses if you did n't see the flags protruding from the soil . Or , as Manclark puts it on the Pasture Golf home page , " At its birth , golf was the game of a rural people , played simply on the fells and fields where sheep and cattle grazed . Pasture golf celebrates the undercurrent , the backwash maybe , that returns to these grassroots . " Manclark 's taste for that backwash seeped up through the roots of his family tree , from his grandfather John , a pro at a no-frills club called Hilton Park , near Glasgow , Scotland , where he mixed drinks at the bar when he was n't fixing swings . And it coursed through the blood of Manclark 's father , Thomas , an insurance adjuster who died in bed at 83 with his clubs laid out beside him in preparation for that morning 's scheduled round . When Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quit the local country club in protest of the slow play and stodginess . He took to teeing up at an unkempt muni on the grounds of a mental institution . " My dad had no need for fancy trappings , " Manclark says . " He knew that golf was about exercise and enjoyment and playing it as it lies . " Manclark 's own love for the game has long been stronger than his knack for it . He made the golf team in junior high but soon realized that track was his sport . After college , Manclark married , moved to Oregon and founded an energy-conservation company . On the rare days that he watched golf on TV , he noticed that the pro game , with its flawless fairways and pure greens , bore less and less resemblance to the game he slogged away at in his free time . One afternoon he learned that Augusta National uses insulated piping to regulate the temperature beneath its famed 12th green . Manclark nearly spat up his Glenfiddich . " That just struck me as absurd , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect their home courses to be like that . They do n't realize that to have acre after acre of fairway without a single weed , to have grass cut one-thirty-second of an inch high , that 's not a natural thing . " The unsettling Masters moment was still sitting with him in 1999 , when Manclark visited relatives in Alaska . Near the town of , yes , Palmer , he played nine holes on a converted-hayfield course . Its name was Fishhook Glen ( the Glen was later dropped because it sounded too fancy-pants ) . Wrapping up his round , Manclark realized , " I just had a boatload of fun . " That evening , over beer , he hatched a plan for Pasture Golf . Like the venues it celebrates , the Web site is a deeply informal affair , a compendium of courses , golf-related links and witticisms posted on a page beneath the Pasture Golf logo : a golf ball emblazoned with the image of a grazing bull . Since its launch four years ago , pasturegolf.com has tapped a reservoir of interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worthy of Pasture Golf approval . Like the course in Coromandel , New Zealand , with a slaughter-house overlooking the 9th tee . Or the track in Oregon that charges no greens fees  --  players leave mole traps or bags of fertilizer as payment . Manclark scrutinizes every submission , tossing out any with the faintest upscale gloss . He 's partial to courses whose scorecards include ads for beef jerky . Resort courses , of course , are verboten . And the words country club raise deep suspicion , though not in the case of a Pasture Golf paradise in Steamboat Springs , Colorado  --  the aptly named Cow Chip Country Club . Pasturegolf.com used to sponsor a tournament of sorts , though " sponsor " is an exaggeration . It was simply a call for golfers to play a four-course pasture loop and submit their scores over the Internet . After three years , the event petered out in 2003 , not for lack of interest or lack of funding but for , well , it 's hard to say . " Pasture golfers do n't have a problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us are out here simply for the feeling of that one pure shot . " There is an environmental bent to Pasture Golf , but not a radical one . " It 's not like I 'm about to go chain myself in protest to the 18th green at Augusta , " Manclark says . Pasture Golf is simply about getting back to nature , about playing the game in its unglamorous , unbulldozed state . The site now lists several dozen courses , all " Bob Barkers " in Pasture Golf parlance , because the price is right . Though Manclark does n't place a cap on greens fees , it 's fair to say that a true Pasture Golfer would rather play in lightning than shell out $30 for a round . On this bright , blue morning , five bucks was what Manclark coughed up for his round at Woodburn , slipping his cash through an honor-system drop box , and he was getting his money 's worth . The air was crisp , like the pace of play ( a round of Pasture Golf should never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing water , Woodburn 's sand greens were rolling true . The course , built in 1925 on what was once an orchard , is owned by a small group of stockholders who have never cashed in a dividend , but have crafted a list of local rules , like the one posted above the drop box : " A 500-pound gorilla might not have to replace his divots , but you do . " Course " maintenance " is carried out largely by volunteers , and by the good will of golfers who drag mats over the sand greens after putting out . Many Pasture Golf courses depend on such collective kindness , and what Manclark likes about them are the quirky communities they give rise to , communities composed of men like Al , who wore rain pants and a slicker though the sky was cloudless , and carried a global-positioning gizmo to calculate his yardage , though he was n't likely to break 95 . " The GPS device , " Manclark whispers , " is n't really a Pasture Golf sort of thing . " Marching toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surroundings  --  the furry fairways , the farm next door where the chickens were making their aromatic presence known . At that very moment , at neatly groomed clubs around the country , players were waggling their pricey titanium drivers , teeing up balls that cost more per sleeve than Manclark 's round . And here he was amid the beautiful sloppiness of Woodburn , where you cuffed your pants , crossed your fingers and cast no aspersions on a crooked lie . Manclark would n't have traded it for the world . He struck a shot . The ball landed somewhere in the distance . Maybe in the fairway . Maybe in a varmint hole . Al nodded in approval . " Nice shot , " he said . " You ought to find that one , I think . " FAST , CHEAP AND OUT OF CONTROL The grass is n't always greener , but the price is cheaper and the pace of play quicker at Pasture Golf tracks . Here are nine that meet Bruce Manclark 's approval .
