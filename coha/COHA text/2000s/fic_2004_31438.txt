Prologue A journal by Victoria Anne Dearbourne , 1850 January 17 Today is the third day of our time here . Mother , Miss Scott , and I survived the wreck of the Serendipity and drifted in a leaky lifeboat to a deserted isle somewhere in south Oceania . Becalmed for weeks , we 'd been unable to escape the approaching typhoon season . Mother said it was as though we 'd been held in place for the storm . When the timbers began to break , the sailors scurried  --  like rats , all of them  --  to abandon the ship and every one of us . One crashed into Mother  --  he did n't even hesitate when she fell into the lifeboat from the height of the deck . Her back was separated and her arm was shattered as well . But she is strong , and I am convinced if we find help , she will recover . We have not yet found Father . I looked up through the rain and foam and spied him atop the deck , a child in his arms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gone . Is it wrong for me to wish he 'd left the children screaming down below and escaped ? The vile crew did . It does n't matter what I wish  --  he never would have left them . It was this morning that we received a windfall of supplies from the sea . Mother whispered to me that it is the hand of Fate that brought us these gifts , though Miss Scott says it 's only a repeating current  --  the same that brought us here ( Mother has said that though Camellia Scott is only in her twenties , she is very wise , and so I do n't know which version I wish to accept ) . Miss Scott and I hauled ashore several trunks , a cask of much needed water , a paddle , and other various goods . Amongthe trunks , we found the captain 's footlocker , and inside was an empty log and a bottle of ink . Miss Scott bade me record our time here . She probably believes if I am occupied so , I wo n't be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I have , and even as I cared for Mother and wrote , I still saw the two bodies that floated in with our bounty . The sea had done awful , awful things to them . I know Miss Scott dragged them to the edge of the jungle and buried them , because I see the tracks in the sand and her palms blistered from the paddle handle . Miss Scott has only been with us for a short time , and I know she wants to spare us any harshness . But I hope she would tell me if one of the deceased was Father . January 18 Last night was the first night Mother cried . She tried to be strong , but the pain was too great . Rain began to drizzle and the wind gusted . Miss Scott found flints in the lifeboat and tried time after time to light a fire . It was hopeless , but I think it took her mind from the situation . By the time she 'd given up and fallen asleep where she knelt , her hands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Scott because " she is so very young for such an important charge . " January 19 I see how much I 've written and worry that one log will not be enough , but Miss Scott predicted we will be rescued well before I run out of paper . Later in the day , she found a map in one of the trunks and tried to determine our location , sending me to look for firewood on the beach despite the fact that we have no fire . When I returned , both she and Mother seemed resigned to staying here for some time . We must be far away from civilization . Though Miss Scott and I beg her , Mother has stopped taking her share of what little water we have left . January 20 Last night I dreamt of Father , of him laughing with Mother and me , of him patiently teaching me to fish or tie knots . Father 's laugh is wonderful , hearty because of his barrel chest , and he 's quick to it . He loves Mother so much he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we explored , the two would search for creatures , some little beastie never seen before . He always marveled when Mother sketched its exact image , though she 'd done it again and again for the articles they published . Then he 'd set down her drawing and twirl her around , grab me up under his arm , and proclaim that the three of us were the best team in this hemisphere , at least . And then Miss Scott joined us too , to teach me deportment and sums , and to become Mother 's boon companion . Everything had seemed so perfect . Luckily , I rose before Mother and Miss Scott because I woke up crying miserably . I dried my eyes , but all throughout the day when I thought of him , I felt just on the verge of tears , my lip trembling and face turning hot , just like the babies I played with on the ship . Both Miss Scott and Mother tell me each day to be brave , but today they seemed even more insistent . Yet in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my hands crying like a little child though I am thirteen ! I told her I did n't know if I was strong enough to do everything that needed to be done on the island . I know we need to build a shelter . I try to remember everything I 've learned from our travels , but she and Papa always did the hardest things while I played with whatever children we came upon . Mother told me that I am indeed strong enough to survive here . She said , " Remember , Tori , diamonds are born of pressure . " January 21 The deep cuts on Miss Scott 's hands are not healing and are so swollen she ca n't close her fingers . I know how dangerous this is in this climate . I did not know I could worry even more than I had been . There 's still no sign of Father , but I have to believe he survived and is even now standing on the bow of some grand ship ( bigger than that hateful Serendipity ) searching for us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that we have so little of both . It drives me to think of ways to get them . Miss Scott wants to go inland to search for a spring or some fruit but fears leaving us alone on the beach or taking me with her into that dark jungle . The sounds at night tell us it 's packed with creatures that we might n't want to see . This afternoon , Mother made me sit beside her . In a solemn voice , she told me that Father might not have lived . Hearing her say that was like a hit to my chest . It was n't real until she voiced it . When my tears finally died down , she looked me in the eyes and told me that no matter what , my grandfather would find us . She swore that he would n't stop searching until he brought us home . But I know that he 's too old to journey so far . Mother vowed he will send someone in his stead . January 22 , Afternoon We have decided that I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less the jungle frightens me . But I have a sense I ca n't shake  --  a heavy feeling that something is happening . I know it , and the back of my neck feels like it 's covered in ants . Something 's about to go wrong . I almost laugh at the words above . About to go wrong . How much more wrong could our circumstances be ? I glanced over at Mother and saw her urgently whispering to Miss Scott . My mother , who 's always been so sensitive to others ' feelings , was unaware she was squeezing Miss Scott 's ruined hands . Miss Scott winced as she listened , but said nothing . Am I to lose my father and my mother as well ? Sometimes I feel as if all my fears and sadness are held in check with something as thin as lace . And sometimes I 'm tempted to rip the threads open , to tear at my hair and scream so long and loud that I become frightful . That the things I fear will fear me instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
