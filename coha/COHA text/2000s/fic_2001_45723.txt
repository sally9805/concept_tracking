Longtime readers of science fiction might recognize this author 's name from the two stories he published in Galaxy magazine in the 1950s . Younger readers are apt to be familiar with Mr. Arkin 's books for children , including The Clearing and Cassie Loves Beethoven . But popular culture being what it is , odds are better that you recognize this byline as belonging to the talented thespian whose work includes memorable roles in Catch-22 , The Slums of Beverly Hills , The Seven  --  Percent Solution , and The In-Laws ( a favorite around these parts ) . You might also remember that his was the voice of Schmendrick in the animated adaptation of The Last Unicorn . His current projects include the television series 100 Centre Street and the forthcoming film America 's Sweethearts . In his book Why People Believe Weird Things , skeptic Michael Shermer touches on the question of faith and how it affects debunkers like Martin Gardner who live by applying reason and logic to apparent miracles . Here now is a story that addresses this issue directly . <p> THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suffering the first class passengers as they stowed their mountains of carry-on luggage : their enormous garment bags , their meticulously picked out yet casual underseat bags , the overhead shopping bags from Bloomingdale 's and F.A.O . Schwarz . He looked balefully off in the distance , pretending not to be there while they grunted and groaned and filled the aisles , keeping him from his work . He moved briskly forward through business class where everyone was already at their computers , and into the tourist section . The place , he told himself , where he preferred to be . He found his aisle seat in the rear of the plane and sat down with authority , pushing his large black briefcase under the seat in front of him , kneading and shoving it deeply into the inadequate crevice and wedging his feet on either side . With his peripheral vision he sized up the man sitting next to him in the window seat , the person he would try to avoid for the next several hours . Warning signals screamed at Grandy , telling him to stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was some kind of throwback from the sixties , no doubt on his way to Topanga Canyon or Big Sur or was it Taos , now ? He was wearing a robe tied with a coarse rope ; he had long hair and a beard , and wore sandals on his unsocked feet . Someone to avoid at all costs . Grandy pulled out his briefcase again . He snapped it open , pulled out a manila folder , and hunched into it with a frown and a privacy hand held up over his eyes like a visor . The beautiful yet married stewardess passed through the plane smiling cheerily , checking seatbelts and taking drink orders from the passengers . The plane taxied down the runway and they were off . At somewhere around twenty thousand feet Grandy could feel eyes on him . He knew that particular stare . The pilgrim to his right had recognized him . Grandy braced himself for the inevitable question , or review , or critique , and he automatically began the game he 'd devised over the years of trying to guess from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He decided the man would be generally approving at first so he could slide into the main agenda , which was demonstrating to Grandy the keen edge of his critical faculties . A fan 's initial statement always revealed as much about the fan as Grandy needed to know . Sometimes the encounter was pleasant ; mostly it was annoying and time-consuming . An essential element in encounters with a fan was the ability to get away . Impossible in this situation . Trapped in the seat which was an inch and a half too small in each direction , he armed himself against the invasion of privacy by pulling out a pencil and starting to write furiously . The pilgrim cleared his throat and moved closer to him . Intimately . Conspiratorially . " Excuse me , " he said , leaning into Grandy with an unearned intimacy , " I do n't mean to bother you .. but are you who I think you are ? " Grandy hated that question with all his heart . For twenty years he 'd heard it and for twenty years an adequate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without a degree in nineteenth-century German philosophy . If he answered " Yes , " simply , graciously , it made him an egomaniac . If he said , " I 'm not sure who you think I am , " it was an invitation to an endless dialogue , and if he said " no " he was lying and no one would believe him anyway . If someone asked that particular question , they knew who he was . " How the hell should I know who you think I am ? " was what he wanted to say , but he never did . On this occasion he hunched over his notes and mumbled " I do n't know who you think I am . " He said it quietly enough so that it was inaudible yet polite . " You are , are n't you ? " the hippie said , beaming . " You 're the Amazing Grandy , right ? " " Yes , " Grandy nodded , affecting disinterest in his own celebrity . " All right ! " the hippie said predictably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " HA ! " gleefully at the ceiling , then leaned close into Grandy . " I really do n't want to bug you , " he said . " You 've probably got work to do , but I just want to tell you I 've been a fan of yours for a long time . I 'm not into magic very much , but you turn it into something more than that . You make it an art form . " " Thank you , " Grandy said , warming up a bit . The man had taste and he was not going to embarrass Grandy by speaking loudly and making spectacles of the two of them . " I think I saw you on TV a couple of weeks ago , did n't I ? " the hippie said . " You could have , " said Grandy , maintaining a warm neutrality in case things turned sour . " What was it ? " the man said , " Jay Leno ? " " Probably Letterman , " said Grandy . " Letterman , right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the handkerchiefs and the bananas . It was dazzling , man , and very funny too . In a literary way . It was n't just jokes ; there was real wit in your material . You 're talented in a lot of different directions and you have something to say . if " Thank you very much , " said Grandy , starting to thaw . " It must be hard to figure out what to do on television these days , " the man went on . " They can play around with the media so easily that people have become blase and cynical . It must be hard to amaze anybody anymore . " " It 's not easy , " said Grandy . . " But you found a way to do it , " the pilgrim went on . " No one watching could think it was faked . " " It was faked , " said Grandy . He smiled knowingly . " Well , yes , in the sense that it was a magic trick , but I meant .... " the pilgrim said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cautionary finger . " I take this very seriously , " he said . " What you meant to say is that my trick could n't be manipulated by TV technicians . " " Exactly , exactly , " the man agreed , " that 's what I meant . " " What I do is illusion , " Grandy said , lecturing to the man . " It 's not reality . I always make that very clear . " " Right , right , " the man said , bobbing his head up and down excitedly , anticipating and almost enjoying the reprimand . " But I think you know what I was trying to say . " " I know what you were trying to say , " said Grandy , " but it 's an important distinction . I have a thing about it , in fact . " " Right , right , " the man said , laughing , his head bobbing up and down many times in hipness and agreement . " I should have remembered . You 're into this debunking thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Grandy , " and if you know about that , you know I take this very seriously . " " As well you should , " said the man , " as well you should . " Since it seemed that they might be talking for a bit , the man near the window relaxed a little , and held out his hand . " My name 's Jesus , incidentally , " he said casually . The Amazing Grandy took the man 's hand gingerly and gave him a furtive glance . Dangerous to continue , impossible not to . " That 's an unusual name , " he said . " I suppose so , " the man said easily , " and you know what ? " he went on , looking slightly sheepish , " I have a confession to make . I do n't have a lot of spare time , but when I saw you do that thing with the two ladies , the gasoline , and the dolphin ? Where was that ? On the " Caesar 's Palace Special/was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited that I went out and got some paraphernalia to try and duplicate it . I 'm embarrassed to even admit it . I do n't know what came over me . I did n't get the ladies and the dolphin , obviously , I got small inanimate replicas , you understand , but I could n't make it work . I could n't even figure out the principle . What was it , mirrors or what ? I do n't suppose you 'd tell me how you did it ? No , no , no , " he said , pushing Grandy away as if Grandy was tempting him , " forget I said that . " He backed up to the window to get a wide angle view of Grandy . " I ca n't tell you what an absolute gas it is to be sitting next to you , " he said , beaming . " Is n't it supposed to be bad karma or whatever you call it to give yourself the name of Jesus ? " Grandy said dubiously . " I 'm the Jesus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , I want to talk about you . " " You 're Jesus Christ ? " Grandy said , his interest piqued . " I 'm the Jesus ! " the man said , in a self-mocking sort of way . " What an arrogant thing to say . There are half a million Mexicans out there named Jesus and I say " I 'm the Jesus . " " " Listen , pal , " said Grandy with an appreciative chuckle , " If you 're Jesus Christ , that makes you " the " Jesus , let 's face it . Hay-soos Gonzales is n't going to feel the least bit slighted , take my word for it . And if I can give you a little advice , do n't play yourself down . People do n't appreciate it . They expect someone who 's " made it " to act special and if you come on humble they 'll resent it and take advantage of you . " Grandy loosened his tie and relaxed into the conversation . The two of them had something to talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who Jesus is , " he continued , " and if you 're him , then you go ahead and call yourself " the " Jesus . You 've earned it , flaunt it . " The stewardess came by and gave Grandy his Bourbon and soda , Jesus his Virgin Mary . Jesus swizzled his drink and began sipping it with a straw . " It must be a blessing for you to have a certain amount of anonymity , " he said to Grandy . Grandy stiffened slightly . " What do you mean by that ? " he said . " Well , you have n't reached superstar status , " Jesus said easily , " so you can pretty much come and go as you please without people ragging on you . That 's a blessing , do n't you think ? " Grandy nodded and looked for the blessing . " Well , look at you , " he said to his companion . " You 're back here in tourist just like me . You seem to be getting away with it . " Jesus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They take a quick look and worry that I 'll start singing Michael Row the Boat Ashore " or hand out pamphlets on legalizing marijuana , so I usually get a wide berth . If someone gets inquisitive and I want to be left alone , I say I 'm doing Godspell at a dinner theater in Florida . That gets rid of almost everyone . " He sipped his drink thoughtfully . " Signing a check or a credit card can tend to start a commotion . I brace myself whenever that comes up . " There was a small piece of lemon stuck in his straw and he concentrated on clearing the tip . " So what are you up to these days ? " Grandy asked as casually as he was able . " Same old stuff , " said Jesus , absorbed in his straw . Grandy was shocked . " Same old stuff ? What a jaded-sounding thing to say . " " Well , I 'm still doing the same things , " said Jesus , " and I 've been doing them for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it sound boring , it 's not , it 's just very ... familiar . It 's what I do . I guess we all get a little blast about what we do , do n't we ? " " What kind of attitude is that ? " Grandy said , almost in alarm . " It 's got to be great being Jesus . You 've got everything in the world going for you . The adoration of the multitudes , you can come and go as you please , you could probably be flying first class right now you wanted to , you get almost universally good press ; you 've got this veil of benign mystery surrounding you which makes it impossible for anyone to come out and be critical , at least openly . That 's all very good stuff . Things seem to going very well for you . " " Well , you 've got nothing to complain about either , " Jesus said . " Look at you . Magician , raconteur , you 're an inventor , world traveler , lecturer , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many parts . " " Thank you , " Grandy said , thinking about all his many parts . " How did you get into that debunking business ? " Jesus asked , " If you do n't mind my asking . " " I do n't mind at all , " Grandy said . He cleared his throat and shifted himself up in his seat . " There are a lot of frauds and swindlers in the world , " he said , warming up to a subject he was clearly passionate about , " and I started getting angry at the advantage they take of innocent , gullible people . I felt I could do something about it . " " Who are they , these frauds and swindlers ? " Jesus asked . Grandy looked at him with mild suspicion . " You know who they are , " he said . " I 'm afraid I do n't , " said Jesus . " You said you know about my debunking work , " said Grandy . " I know of it , " Jesus said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't say that I 've gone into it in any depth . " " Well , here , " Grandy said , digging into his briefcase . " Let me show you some of my work on the subject . " He pulled out a sheaf of papers and folders , shuffled through them quickly and gave Jesus a looseleaf binder filled with plastic windows . Inside the windows were articles from fairly reputable magazines . Pictures of Grandy jumped off every page , leaning into the camera at a dangerously steep angle , eyes bulging and his hands doing intricate gestures as if trying to hypnotize the viewer into performing a vaguely illicit act . The headline on the first article said , " LOOK OUT , CHARLATANS ! HERE COMES GRANDY ! " Underneath it said : " Look out , you quacks and mountebanks , you frauds and fakes . Here comes the Amazing Grandy and he 's going to debunk you . With the zest of a bloodhound on a fresh trail , Grandy told us : ' I can duplicate all of your miracles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their own self aggrandizement think they have the right to uproot people 's sense of reality . The frauds who give people false hope with promises of miracle cures , who profess to have incredible powers , who claim to have a pipeline to the hereafter , who 'd like us to believe they can move material objects from a distance , who tell us they have intimate relationships with aliens and God-like beings from other solar systems . " " Jesus leafed through the book looking at the headlines . " My goodness , " he said , " this is quite a crusade you 're on . I had no idea . " " Let them enthrall the masses , that 's fine , " Grandy said , the sight of his articles refueling his sense of mission . " Let them make a living at it , let them make huge sums of money . That 's fine too , but they have no right to play with people 's minds . It 's evil , it 's manipulatory , and it 's dangerous . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tray as punctuation . " So I go after the frauds . I get them too , " he said , leaning in to Jesus , as if implying more than he could speak about . " How do you expose them ? " Jesus asked . " It 's actually very easy , " Grandy said , " I just watch the acts . I look for the passes , the sleight of hand , the mechanical equipment , the shills and accomplices . If you 've been doing this as long as I have you know what to look for . I see them a couple of times , I dope them out , then I simply duplicate their routines . And I do it with more style , and more production value , and it 's over . It 's the end of them . " " My goodness , " Jesus said , still examining the material . " You 've got everything in here . Flying saucers , spoon benders , all kinds of things . How do you do flying saucers ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He cleared his throat and sat up very straight . " Remote control model airplanes , somewhat modified with revolving lights and things , and an eight millimeter camera . What could be simpler ? " " What about the Philippine healers ? " Jesus asked . " That 's just sleight of hand and a bag of chicken guts , " said Grandy , with a shrug . " What did you do with the spoon bender ? " said Jesus . " Uri Geller ? A simple and stupid act , " Grandy said , motioning to the stewardess for another drink , " but he has controls that are difficult to duplicate . That took several months to figure out , believe it or not . I ended up respecting him in a certain kind of way . " " Elizabeth Kubler Ross ? What 's she doing in here ? " " The light at the end of the tunnel business . Disembodied family members . I did that routine at a medical convention and it brought down the house . I got wonderful press on that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime . I do Edgar Cayce in the same evening if I have the budget . He takes a lot of time because I have to do medical checks on the entire audience . During the act I have doctors talking to me on an ear mike . The predictions are easy . You can say anything , as long as you get laughs . No one bothers to wait forty years to see if they come true . " " And the Maharishi ? " " The flying routine ? Levitating ? " Grandy said scornfully . " Come on . It 's just the old rope trick . Oldest routine in the world . They put the kibosh on that along with the Hindu Fakirs decades ago . This was just a variation on that chestnut . " Grandy reached over and turned a page in the portfolio . " This I was very proud of , " he said , pointing to the Dalai Lama . " I did a reincarnation number for the Sony Corporation in Tokyo . I got a three  --  year-old black kid from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred items , twelve of which belonged to one of their executives who died about two years before . The kid picked them out , said they were his , and demanded them back . The crowd went absolutely nuts , and that 's one I 'm not revealing to anyone . It was too hard and took too long to work out . Simple principle , but murderously difficult to perfect . Kids are always unpredictable . " " You 've even got Padre Pio in here , " said Jesus , lost in the picture . " I had a little problem with him , " said Grandy . " Not with the routine , that was easy , but his fans gave me a really hard time . A very zealous group . I almost had to back off and drop the routine . " " What 's the routine ? " Jesus asked . " Oh , you know , the bleeding hands , being in two places at one time .... " " What you 're doing can get dangerous , " said Jesus . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I mean is , you do n't want to throw out the baby with the bathwater . " " Please , " said Grandy holding up a cautionary hand , " not you too ? " " Just a thought , " said Jesus , leafing through more of the book . " Do you do me ? " he asked casually , flipping the pages . " I 'Ve got you down , " said Grandy , chuckling like a bad boy . " You 're easy . " " What stuff of mine do you do ? " Jesus asked with delight . " I do the walking on water , for example , " Grandy said . " You 're kidding me , " Jesus said . " No I 'm not , " said Grandy . " The first time was at Four Flags in New Jersey . It was spectacular . We had a crowd of about ten thousand people . " " I think I had about a dozen when I did it , " said Jesus . " Yes , and if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Grandy , " So you could n't use them for corroboration . It would n't hold up . No one would buy it . " " How do you walk on water ? " Jesus asked Grandy . " Simple as can be . A moving platform under water . We started with a biblical water ballet to dispel the possibility of the platform , then I appear in a rowboat , I get out , and I walk on the water . It was simple but it was spectacular . The crowd goes crazy . I also do the loaves and fishes . " " Really ! " Jesus said , obviously impressed . Grandy reached over and flipped through the notebook to a picture of a throng . " Take a look at this . Knotts Berry Farm , " he said . " Nineteen eighty seven . Eight thousand people . Three thousand fish and two thousand loaves of bread . What was your crowd ? " " I do n't think we had more than about five or six hundred , " said Jesus . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do the return from the dead , " said Grandy , beginning to gloat a little in spite of himself . " What about healing the leper ? " Jesus asked . " That 's a tough one , " said Grandy . " I have n't done that one yet . There are a couple of ways to go but I have n't found anything that feels right . I could pay someone off to say he 'd been a leper , use makeup , cheap stuff like that , that 's the easy way , but I 'm scrutinized very carefully . They go over my subjects with a fine tooth comb . That 's something you did n't have to worry about . " " I had other things to worry about , " said Jesus . " Maybe , but they were simpler times , " said Grandy . " People were easier to please . " " Do you know why I 'm so impressed with you ? " Jesus said . Grandy looked for some edge of sarcasm in his voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . " Because you can do things . That 's why , " Jesus said . " And you know how you do them . You get an idea , you figure out a way it will work , and then it does . It works . There 's a whole arc of experience for you . The excitement of the chase . Conquest and sense of mastery . Very appealing . " " So can you do things . Supposedly you 've done a lot of things . " " Naaah , " said Jesus with a self-deprecatory wave of his hand . " I ca n't do anything . All I can do is ask that it be done . Then I sit around and wait . And hope . Sometimes it 's done and sometimes it is n't done . And then once it is done , if it is done , I never know how it 's done . It 's frustrating . It 's an anxious-making situation . I had to finally adopt the philosophy that if it did n't happen , then " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonder if that thought was n't just a dodge to fend off disappointment , but I 've come to think there might be something to it . " " Win some , lose some , " said Grandy in a sort of agreement . " Exactly , " Jesus said , tapping Grandy on the chest with a finger , " win some , lose some . Or better yet ... " Thy Will Be Done ! " " He said this rather grandly , then he looked out at the clouds and said it more simply ; this time to the sky . He went back to Grandi 's portfolio , leafing through it randomly . " You 've got it all down , " he said . " Amazing . You 've got the goods on everyone . You 've debunked the whole world . No one can get past you . No one can do anything that you ca n't duplicate . " He looked at Grandy with appreciation , then thought of something . " Well perhaps there 's one thing I can do that you ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is that ? " Grandy asked imperiously . Jesus moved closer to him and looked into his eyes as no one had ever looked in his eyes . Not his mother , not the several women who had professed to love him , not his dog , not his most adoring fans . " I can forgive you , " Jesus said simply . He smiled at Grandy , gently and innocently . The Amazing Grandy stared back in shock and confusion . Was it a joke ? He looked for a hint of humor in that face , or mockery . He looked for superiority , for anger , for something he could give a name to . Jesus did n't turn away under his scrutiny , he just sat there beaming and beaming , smiling and open and compassionate . Grandy stared back , his confusion turned to contempt , then outrage and indignation . " You can forgive me ? " he managed to say . " For what ? For what am I being forgiven ? Who are you to forgive me ? " Jesus continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talent ? That 's your gift ? " Grandy sputtered , maintaining enough control to keep the other passengers from taking notice . " That 's what makes you special ? " He snorted in derision and tried to stare Jesus down . Jesus just smiled and smiled . Grandy forced himself to turn away . He dug furiously into his portfolio and buried himself in the notes for his appearance that evening , trying to give the impression that he was able to concentrate on something . When he left the plane he did not say good-bye to Jesus , he did n't offer him a ride or exchange addresses . He went to his hotel . He took off his jacket and pants and put them neatly on the bed . He lay down next to them and turned on the television set . Somewhere in the middle of the local news he became consumed by deep uncontrollable sobs of grief and pain that threatened to tear him apart . " What the hell is this ? " Grandy said in the middle of the earthquake going on inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down upon himself as at some strange specimen , some alien . The spasms continued through his shower , through getting dressed , and only subsided when he was in the elevator on the way down to meet his contact for the lecture .
