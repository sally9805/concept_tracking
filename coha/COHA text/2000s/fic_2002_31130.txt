Chapter One : Late The child had a rash across the chest , a fearsome swath of color  --  infection , the aunt thought , bred of the child . Mold on dough . Blood mold . Why , look at the child , just look at the child !  --  dripping , it seemed , the irises fluid  --  red in the nose , the cheeks , pale belly as if risen ; and there in an indolent fist , a bulbous , sucked-on toy in the likeness of some sort of life-form . " What , this ? " said the mother . " This ? " It was only the weather , the mother said , the heat , this rash . The sight of her , the aunt thought : wan unironed sister in the light . The hand a fleshy visor . Useless . To have traveled like this , with the heat and with the child , in the festering light , no bags but bags , the aunt observed , brown paper gone to pulp , as if juice had leaked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and clothes spilling over the tops of the bags , such clothes you could scarcely imagine , or not quite imagine , slack-hemmed , rayon , secondhand , the aunt supposed , with rounds of stain below the arms , a bra strap dingy as unrinsed teeth . " I have never ... " the aunt said . " Never mind . " The platform was empty . The train had been late . The child lacked a shirt . " Up , " he said . He looked at her : aunt , tall stranger , relation . There he stood with bare , afflicted chest  --  arms held out , toy held out , offered to her , beseeching her , and yet , the aunt thought , there was something familial and hard about the brow . " Here , " she said . " I 'll lend a hand . " She took a bag . Her dress began to dampen . " Shall we ? " she said . " Shall we hasten ? " she said , and her sister  --  a touch , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , Elise her name  --  said yes . They walked . The child toddled . The tracks were beside them . " James , " said the mother , Elise , for the child had come into possession of things  --  a pebble , twig , a splinter . " Jim , " she said . A berry . " Baby , " she called him . Poison ? " Drink ? " she said , and lifted him ( one-armed , muscled , the aunt saw ) squalling to a hip . The wonder the toy not lost . It was in the mother 's mouth . It was in the child 's hand . " There , in there , " the mother said . " What in where ? " the aunt said . " The juice , " the mother said . " In that sack . Yes , I think so . Would you be so good ? " The aunt made a motion and soiled herself . The child yelped . The bag the aunt held had no bottom . The child dragged fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Elise ! " ) with the child ( " James , " she said , her voice a scratch ) and with a bag herself ( still holding things ) and with , of course , the toy , and with what looked to the aunt to be considerable effort , crouched . " Lord , " said the mother . " Lord on high . " She had her hair in her face , and her clothes were in the road , and the road rather presently was sifted through her fingers . Earth , a sock , a sock  --  not hers , this last , she said  --  a sopping wrapper , used . " Do n't , " she said , " touch that . " And turning to the aunt , to her sister , " Juice , " she said , as if saying , the aunt thought , " Do n't just watch . " The aunt , of course , watched . And more than that , she was thinking : What of her dress , she thought , her scarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruined bag ? It was still in her hands ; and still on the tip of her tongue , this : " Elise , " she said ( she said this much ) , " stand up , leave it . Think about him . Will you think about him ? " The mother sniffed a garment . " Child , " the aunt said . " You have not seen him . He is not right , " and to the child : " Soon , " she said . " Why , as soon as we get there , you 're to have wholesome milk . " * * * The place was not the aunt 's . Suppose , for the sake of discussion , the place was the father 's . ( Not of the child , no , but of the aunt ; the father of the aunt , and of the mother of the child , of course , of Elise . ) The place was not kept up . That it was not kept up is not open to question . Try , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be of service , try and be a neighborly , a daughterly daughter , and what , the aunt thought , what with whatever , what without thanks , why , one got what ? Dirt , the aunt thought , that was what : the cellophane nibbled in the pantry , crumbs , rice , a yeasty smear , the place as if in motion . Oh , such birth ! Here the aunt had grown , slow inch upon inch as if awaiting an occasion to rise to ; here Elise had grown , turned in on herself . The father 's bones rose out of the body . Veins , hairs , moles  --  the sickened mass of him ! The chair in an unbudgeable condition of recline . Just who , the aunt said , entering , did she , Elise , suppose it was that she , the aunt , looked like ? Had she done her part ? Was she the father 's mother ? " After all , " the aunt said . There was spittle in an ashtray . The child appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aunt to be a fever in the eyes . Elise crossed the threshold . " Pop , " she said . " Yes ? " she said , with arms full , always with arms full , exertion in the mouth , in the angle of the jaw , and in the ungroomed frizz about the forehead and nape . The skin , the aunt thought , was looking worse . " Girls ? " said a voice . It was failing and gruff . " Girls ? Girls ? " The aunt dabbed a temple , and gently , with a certain decorum , her chest , the tissue at the bosom pinkly crushed . She tasted salt  --  the lips so damaged ! ( Nothing , the aunt had said , might cross them . ) " My , " she said . " Me , " said the child , James , Jim , Baby , Yoo-hoo , whichever one it was . " Me , me , me . " Feet to the floorboards . " You , " said the mother . " Put that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rather deftly , the aunt thought ) produced dried milk , said , " You are not the mother . No sirree . " The child said , " I see you . " The aunt changed clothes in a dank space smelling of mothballs . Collars at attention awaited a neck . Dear , departed woman : Mother of the aunt and of the mother of the child and of her own demise  --  swift passage , hers . No tumor-ragged body or bloated cheek , reformed and bypassed heart . She 'd left them all : the reptile purses , topcoats of fur , things hoarded and abandoned . Nothing was light , nothing was lightweight , winterweight the whole of it , as if , the aunt thought , there had been no thought of a season such as this , no thought of an eventual spring . She , the aunt , zipped , was bursting at the seams . The mother of the child did not change . The child continued to want for a shirt . The aunt spoke up , but in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , and halfway hoped : The child 's growth was stunted , the health of the child ignored . " Neglected , " she said . " Blatant , " she said . Jellied , the child rolled bread , chewed open-mouthed . At the foot of the chair was the toy . The toy had eyes . " Pop , " said the mother , Elise . " This is my son . " A sound arose in the father 's throat . " The shade , " he said . " Will you pull it ? " he said ( there was no shade ) , and " This , this  --  this is what I want . This is what I need from the pantry . " Say it was these : sweets , rags , a cigarette . He used the aunt 's name . " Auntie ? " he said . " Is it a boy , did you say ? " The aunt gave the mother of the child a well-worn look . Exposed , the child covered and uncovered and re-covered his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Mama ! " " Oh , " said the mother . " Peekaboo . " " Like this for this ? " the aunt said . " Did you come for this ? Was this what you came for ? Hours , after all , " the aunt said , " on the train . " ( Days , perhaps , for all she knew  --  wherever it was they had come from escaped her  --  rank stops , the clothes left to scatter . ) " And , " the aunt said , " need I add , after year after year of no word ? " " Pop , " said the mother , addressing the chair , herself in shabby clothing , the house gauzed in heat , the hoarded effects of the dead : Oh , come to me . " And , " the aunt said , " he , yes , our mutual father asleep in the chair , insensible , " the aunt said . " Almost . Do you recognize him ? " Discolored , sickly sleeper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pop , " said the mother . " Pop , " as if she were the child  --  which , of course , she was . She had the clothes on her back . No trinket of Mother , nothing of Father . Nothing for sale or show , save him , the boy , disfathered heir , who ( need n't she add it ? ) was bright . Or , at the least , not addled or dim . " I do not want much , " she said . The aunt thought : money ; the aunt thought : shelter ; the aunt thought : doctor ; the aunt thought : maybe decent clothes , respect for the elders ( of which she was one ) , and someone to see to the boy . The mother faced men 's shoes . " Do you remember ? " the mother said , " how Mother would dress us to show us off ? The way she used to dress us ?  --  such fine things . " For it was all of it shared : bow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then , of course , the petticoats , Elise 's often fallen , even with Mother 's intervention , at a hem . The father , in his sleep , was heard to cough . He dreamed of what ? The aunt did not dream , not ever , even once , or else did not recall it . Mornings with the taste of the breath in her mouth , her thinning hair wound tight . " Do n't you remember ? " the mother said . The father seemed to fret . " No , " the aunt said . " No , you do n't . Oh no , you do n't . " Said , " Do n't even try it on me at all . " The child coughed up blood . This was in the night , in the dark of the house , in a room that went unused . It was midnight , give or take . The mother arose . The aunt , aroused , could not recall exactly where she was . She could not place herself  --  how old was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of the child  --  her sister , Elise  --  appeared to her . Ah , the aunt thought ( said it to herself  --  " Ah " ) . Look at her , the aunt thought , so full of maternal disregard . " Juice , " said the mother . The child cried . His fists were bloody things . His fists were at his face and at his bloody , scabby chest . " There , " said the mother . " I do not live here , " the aunt said . A racket in the kitchen : a flick of a light , and leggy dispersal  --  spiders , rodents , whatnot . The patter of feet . " The diaper , " the aunt said , in spite of herself . " Juice , " said the mother . " There , there . " There was no juice . Tonic in a bottle , the child 's voice swelling , the aunt in an inherited nightgown , inheritable robe  --  this touched her flesh  --  all cuffs and straining belt : " Did you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing itself in the aunt 's marred hand . There was age in the hand : cool , dry , boned , the fingers someone else 's . " For this ? " she said . " This ? What good are you doing ? " The child shrieked . " Please , " said the mother . " Help me , please . Where did it get to ? Where did it go ? Where is it  --  Baby 's doll ? " The aunt in darkness saw it , or thought , at least , she saw it : The father of the aunt and of the mother of the child opened his eyes and closed his eyes . " Papa , " she said , on her way past the chair . She touched her breast . She entered a hallway . The mother , Elise , holding the child  --  James , Jim , Baby , blistering offspring , bottled at last , asleep at last , at last in Mother 's arms and presumed to be dreaming : Such rich milk ! Oh , wheel of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . " See ? " she said . " Father ? " The body of the father made a noise . His chest rose and shook . It rose and it shook . The mother of the child swayed with the child . " Father , " she said . " Oh , Father , " she said , and the aunt in darkness heard it .
