<p> When shortstop Derek Jeter was appointed the 11th team captain in the rich history of the New York Yankees last week , it seemed like an appropriate tribute for one of baseball 's best players . <p> New York 's newspapers portrayed it a bit differently , saying : " Boss Tweaks Torre , " " Slap in Face to Torre " and " Boss Turns Up Heat on Torre . " <p> Yankees boss George Steinbrenner was n't subtle about his motives , either . <p> " I think he can give ( the Yankees ) a little spark , " he told the New York Times , referring to Jeter . " I think he can be a big help to Joe Torre . I think he and Joe will work great together . " <p> Steinbrenner was n't done with asking Jeter to assist a manager that did n't know he needed assistance . <p> He also pushed his baseball people to make a move , any move , to acquire a lefthanded hitter , a reliever , a batboy , something . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the deal Steinbrenner approved raised eyebrows as well . <p> Enter Ruben Sierra , a 37-year-old outfielder who had n't gotten along with Torre in a previous stint with the Yankees . <p> Never mind that many scouts believe Sierra is just about done as a player . <p> Another tweak ? <p> Yes , according to one New York newspaper . <p> " The Boss Tweaks Torre . " <p> " Torre Gets Force-fed a Ruben . " <p> A tweak here , a tweak there , and someone is going to end up getting their feelings hurt . <p> With Bernie Williams and Nick Johnson on the disabled list , Steinbrenner hoped Sierra could provide a bit of balance to a lineup dominated by righthanded hitters . <p> With the Bronx Bombers in a monthlong funk , Steinbrenner apparently hoped any little move - tweak ? - could get them going again . <p> It did n't work . <p> The Yankees went to Wrigley Field last weekend , and after winning on Friday , lost back-to-back nationally televised games to the Cubs on Saturday and Sunday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting picked off base , and " underachieving " is a word that keeps showing up in newspaper coverage of the team . <p> " This is more than a stretch right now , " said pitcher Mike Mussina , who starts against the Astros tonight . " You go for a couple of weeks or a month , that can be a stretch . But we have n't played consistently since April . " <p> Now , New York newspapers are prepared for Mount Steinbrenner to erupt . <p> In the past few weeks , he has taken some subtle jabs at Torre and his coaching staff , pitcher Jeff Weaver , center fielder Hideki Matsui and others . <p> In a previous era , he surely would have fired Torre or at least sent him on a sabbatical . <p> Problem is , he ca n't . <p> Torre , who has won four championships in seven seasons , is among the most popular figures in the history of New York sports , and even Steinbrenner , for all his bluster , does n't have the guts to fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The Yankees have the highest payroll in major-league history ( $ 150 million ) . <p> They were supposed to win and win easily this season because they had more quality starting pitching than any other team , more thunderous bats in the middle of the lineup , an overpowering closer in their bullpen and a brilliant manager in their dugout . <p> If they needed anything more , their owner had the money to go out and get it , just as he 'd done last winter in winning bidding wars for Cuban pitcher Jose Contreras and Japanese import Matsui . <p> Just as he 'd done a year earlier in winning the Jason Giambi sweepstakes and a year before that in luring Mussina to the Bronx . <p> From top to bottom , the Yankees were as close to perfect as any team in baseball . <p> Or so it appeared . <p> Now , with 100 games left , they do n't look so perfect . <p> First , there 's the starting pitching . During spring training , the questions were not about the quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven proven starters happy . <p> Since winning 16 straight decisions to start the season , Yankee starters are just 15-17 with a 4.60 ERA . <p> At various times , all of them have struggled , even the front four of Roger Clemens , Andy Pettitte , Mussina and David Wells . <p> In his last eight starts , Pettitte has won just twice and compiled a 5.48 ERA . Over that same stretch , Clemens is 2-4 with a 4.99 ERA . Mussina has pitched a bit better , but a 3.74 ERA has gotten him only three wins in his last eight starts . <p> At the moment , Wells is the ace of the staff , having won five of his last eight with a 3.91 ERA . <p> Weaver pitched so poorly that he was demoted to the bullpen and replaced by Contreras , who has allowed two earned runs in 14 innings as a starter . <p> Offensively , the Yankees are third in the American League in runs , second in home runs and fourth in on-base percentage . <p> Yet , they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-base percentage is lower , their walks are down and their strikeouts are up . The ' 98- ' 99 teams scored runs by working pitchers deep into counts , by forcing them to throw strikes and then by getting key hits at the right time . <p> These Yankees too often rely on the home run . They 're not as patient . <p> They strike out too much . <p> First baseman Giambi , who was Steinbrenner 's big-ticket addition a year ago , is hitting .235 overall and just .229 with runners in scoring position . <p> Right fielder Raul Mondesi , who Steinbrenner picked up during a slump last season and then tried to unload last winter , is hitting .220 with runners in scoring position . <p> Matsui , who arrived to much acclaim last winter , has five home runs in 257 at-bats . <p> By most accounts , these Yankees have more raw talent than they did in 1998-99 . But as Steinbrenner added talent , he may have lost some of the intangible qualities that made those championship teams so good . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more valuable than mere numbers could measure . <p> Steinbrenner 's bullpen is another matter . His decision to allow lefthander Mike Stanton and righthander Ramiro Mendoza to depart via free agency left the unit dramatically weaker . New York 's bullpen ERA of 4.32 is the eighth-best in the AL . In his quest for 300 victories , Clemens has twice turned over leads to his bullpen only to see that lead vanish . <p> Then again , they 'll probably win anyway . <p> Their two primary division rivals , the Red Sox and Toronto Blue Jays , have mediocre starting rotations , and over the long haul , the Yankees surely will begin to play up to their capabilities . <p> Perhaps Steinbrenner just needs to back off a bit . The Yankees are a half-game out of first place even though Jeter missed five weeks because of a shoulder injury , closer Mariano Rivera missed a month and Williams and Johnson are on the disabled list at the moment . <p> General manager Brian Cashman has said getting all the pieces to play as one so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round hole . " Problem is , Steinbrenner has never been good at waiting to see if the pieces fit properly . <p> " It 's very frustrating , " catcher Jorge Posada said . " We keep fighting and fighting and we keep it close , but we 're not winning . It 's tough .
