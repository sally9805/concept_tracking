<p> Patrick and Sharon Terry gave their two children a faulty gene that could make them go blind . They all donated tissue samples to help researchers find the disease-causing gene . <p> But , if not for turning genomic science into their personal fixation , the Terrys would have exercised no control over the medicine built on that gene and meant for families like theirs . <p> A patent-holding corporation , university or agency might license just one laboratory - maybe 3,000 miles away - to develop or analyze tests for the gene . The patent holder could boost prices with high royalties for patented treatments . It might ultimately snub the small market : This disease , known as pseudoxanthoma elasticum , or PXE , strikes no more than 1 in 25,000 . <p> But two of those who have it are Elizabeth and Ian Terry . " Although we have no molecular biology training , we just became obsessed , " says their mother . <p> Genetics charts went up on the walls , beside family photos , in their suburban Boston home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ titles like " Nature Biotechnology " and " The American Journal of Human Genetics . " <p> They found other families with the disease and set up a registry and tissue bank for genetic research . They traveled abroad and met patients and scientists . They began working beside researchers , advising on symptoms and even consulting on scientific strategy , sometimes at their dining room table . <p> Finally , in February , Sharon Terry , a private school chaplain by profession , applied for a patent jointly with researchers on the gene making her children sick . <p> Genetic patents can be worth millions of dollars , but it 's not clear how much money a PXE patent might generate . So far , the gene 's mutations appear to hurt few people , and no tests or treatments exist yet . But Mrs. Terry 's patent stake could give her control , through licensing agreements , over who does research and ultimately provides care . <p> If it turns out that the gene also contributes to other diseases affecting more people , the Terrys might hold something more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PXE research or even subsidize care for people like their children . <p> Like the Terrys , a rising number of patients , doctors and ethicists are questioning how the patent system handles genetic claims . Many say it awards too many patents , overly rewards their holders , and gives too little back to patients . Yet many industry voices complain the process is moving too slowly to keep up with galloping research and to yield medical care awaited by suffering patients . <p> The strains from both sides are apt to intensify . The run on genetic patents will grow fiercer in the next several years , spurred by longer lists of genes and derived proteins discovered by genomics and proteomics projects , according to patent experts in business and government . <p> " The gold rush days are about to begin , " says Arthur Caplan , a bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania . " There are so many targets that look so lucrative that they 're falling all over one another to pursue opportunity after opportunity . " <p> Many in government , industry and science @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keeping them trade secrets . Patents can promote research investment by protecting a future return . The biotechnology industry says it can take more than 10 years and hundreds of millions of dollars to shepherd some drugs to market . <p> But one with mass appeal can be worth several billion , so there 's bound to be a bonanza for the few who are smart , lucky - and quick enough - to seize on genetic medicine . Last year , roughly 21,800 regular biotechnology applications went on file with the U.S. Patent Office , 45 percent more than in 1993 . <p> So far , the office says it has granted claims on only about 1,300 full-length human genes . But DNA within cells appears to carry 30,000 genes or more . The sequence of their chemical bases gives rise to proteins that will likely number in the hundreds of thousands once catalogued by proteomics projects . Many of them , like genes , are potential sources of tests , drugs , or targets for drug action . <p> The stakes are especially high for gene-based patents . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better can opener and skirt someone else 's patent . So far , there 's only one chemistry for a gene : It evolved over millions of years . Also , many of the derived proteins are long , convoluted chains that are more difficult to copy than many classic drugs . <p> Of course , genes , unlike other biological chemicals , define the human condition . Even some scientists are uneasy with patenting them . <p> " Genes ... are naturally occurring substances that should not be patented , " says Michael Watson , director of the American College of Medical Genetics . <p> But he knows that , over the last 20 years , patent law has come to treat them and their byproducts much as it does other chemicals . Discover an unknown genetic molecule , make your own copy , figure out how to use it , and you can patent it . If others want to use it for any purpose , they must in theory pay for 20 years . Then it becomes public . <p> In practice , patent holders virtually always allow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point to other commercial prospects and add value to the patents . <p> The Terrys refused to just wait and hope . Elizabeth and Ian , ages 7 and 5 when diagnosed in 1994 , already showed the signature neck bumps of PXE . They would likely spread and turn to premature wrinkles . The children 's arteries were apt to harden , and they could bleed internally at any time . Their parents read they would likely die by middle age - a belief luckily belied by recent research . <p> " We were traumatized , terrified , overcome with grief , " says their mother . <p> There was no treatment , much less a cure . That remains true today . But the researchers with whom the Terrys collaborated did find the gene in 1999 . The work laid the basis for future tests to identify the gene in babies and adult carriers and , maybe someday , for treatments . If granted , the patent will let the couple help decide - through their PXE International foundation - who can develop and provide such care and how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that their PXE gene will work with other genes related to the clogging of arteries , a condition that afflicts millions . That might prompt a major drug company to develop an interest in their little gene . <p> " We want to make science go faster and make the treatments more accessible and affordable , " says Mrs. Terry . Already , her daughter , now 13 , shows retina damage that could eventually impair her sight . <p> Olivier Le Saux , a University of Hawaii molecular biologist who consulted with the Terrys , says the couple would sometimes make him aware of published research he had missed . " Basically , they were spending all their time looking for information , " he says . <p> Since then , Patrick Terry , an engineer who managed construction projects , co-founded Genomic Health in Redwood City , Calif . It professes to develop drugs with an especially close eye to patient needs . <p> While the Terrys are working on the patent process from within , some families are challenging it from without . Parents of children with Canavan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sued researchers last year . <p> They blame Miami Children 's Hospital , the patent holder , for imposing a $12.50 fee on diagnostic tests . They say it forced a patient advocacy group to end free testing for gene carriers , who can pass it on to their children . Medical authorities recommend that Jews of European heritage , who are especially prone to the Canavan gene , take the test before they have children . <p> The $12.50 may sound like a bargain to be alerted to such a disabling disease . But what if it is combined in five years with tests for dozens of other genetic diseases ? <p> " If we go to testing people for 25 , 50 , and eventually maybe 100 genes , and each one carries a $12.50 fee , then the cost of testing becomes prohibitive - or only the rich will get tested , " says Judith Tsipis , whose son died of the disease . She is now vice president of the National Tay-Sachs and Allied Diseases Association , which sued along with other patient advocates . <p> Yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ultimately lose money on its Canavan research , because patent rights last only 20 years . " This is a once-in-a-lifetime test . The patent rights only last for a finite duration , then the patent royalty fees expire , " she says . <p> The molecular biologist who did much of the work , Reuben Matalon , is now at the University of Texas in Galveston . He was also named in the lawsuit but says he earns nothing from the tests . He says when the hospital asked him early on if he wanted a piece of the patent , he said no . Back then , in the late 1980s , in the early days of genomics , he could n't imagine he was refusing anything so valuable . Now , he says , he might answer differently : " I hate being the only stupid one . " <p> Myriad Genetics of Salt Lake City understands the potential value of genetic patents . It has patented rights to mutations in two genes , BRCA1 and BRCA2 , that predict hereditary breast cancer . The company developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends up costing about $2,500 , doctors say . <p> Meanwhile , Myriad has licensed exclusive rights to drug maker Eli Lilly and Co. to produce drugs based on one of the cancer genes . <p> Some patient groups , scientists and others say too many patent holders , often capitalizing on publicly funded research , license such tests to a single laboratory . The tests could often be duplicated in many places and given to patients . But Robert Nussbaum , a government geneticist , warns of the risk : " There 's one lab , and they will come after you for infringement . " <p> Critics also say too many patents are granted on overlapping or vaguely described , poorly understood science . The royalties , ultimately paid for by patients , stack up . <p> The Patent Office tried to tighten genetic guidelines in January . No more requests , they said , for gratuitous uses for genetic products - like a shampoo additive - that are meant to lock up rights to unforeseen medical applications . <p> " It 's slowing it down and making it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lawyer Lee Bendekgey at Incyte Genomics of Palo Alto , Calif. , a leading genetic patent holder with about 600 . <p> The Patent Office already faces a considerable backup of genetic claims . It estimates that 25,000 claims covering humans , animals and plants await its 250 examiners . Paperwork for a single application can fill dozens of boxes . <p> The patent office says it typically decides claims in about two years . John Doll , the office 's director of biotechnology , says many are enormously complex . " It 's the attorneys and applicants that are pushing the envelope ... of inventions being claimed , " he says . <p> Some industry lawyers say Doll 's cadre of examiners is overwhelmed . They say his unit urgently needs more of them , better training and more computer tools to evaluate claims . <p> " Like any innovative technology , we need things quickly , " says Lila Feisee , who oversees patent issues for the Biotechnology Industry Organization . " For us , the backlog is the kiss of death . " <p> She says without strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs . For her , pricing arguments are secondary . <p> " If one of my kids was sick and there was a test - but it was the only test - I 'd go and try and get that , " says Feisee , a mother of three . " The fact that it 's there is what 's critical to me .
