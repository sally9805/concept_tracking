Who has n't missed an awkward shot when his feet tangled in briars or vines or slid on slopes covered with wet leaves and sticks ? In the old days , in fact , many hunters preferred flushing on command in nearly all circumstances so they could be ready in a good shooting stance . This enabled my great-uncle to calmly choose a cock quail from one side of the covey and then swing to the other side for another , almost never killing hens . If you want to teach your pointer to flush on command , start by teaching the command sounds for come , heel and whoa at eight weeks , using a food bowl or bits of hot dog to elicit the desired response . See " Painless Puppy Training , " April 2001 . Bird introduction follows at no later than 12 weeks . I use a pole launcher for this phase . See " Training With Pigeons , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting experience in very controlled circumstances to avoid errors that require time to correct . Instead of flying low after a release and encouraging puppies to chase , as pigeons will , the pigeons from the pole launcher go straight up . The pup stands and watches them soar high , knowing he ca n't chase and catch them and getting his first lesson in becoming steady to wing . At about four months , when he 's trying to ignore commands and do things his own way , kind but firmer discipline begins on a leash . Instead of a neck collar , use a Halti or a Gentle Leader head collar . Jerking on a neck collar sets up an opposition reflexyou jerk back during heel and whoa sessions and the dog automatically pulls forward . A head collar swiftly ends the struggle by acting like a horse halter . You simply hold the leash firmly when the dog pulls ahead . The pulling soon stops because the dog discovers that his own actions turn him back . When the pup realizes the pole bird can be caught , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control until your dog is steady to wing . Now , finally , the easy part : undermining your training to develop flushing only on command . With the dog on point , walk up on his right side , stop beside his head and then quickly step forward with your left leg flashing past his right eye to urge going along as you hiss , " Get ' em ! " Next time , make the command , " Whoa ! " as you slowly walk past and flush the birds . Then start mixing it up . Maybe he gets two or three flushes in a row , maybe you do . He learns to flush only when commanded . SIDEBAR Keep ' Em Wondering Once widely practiced , flushing on command fell out of vogue in part because of the steady-to-wing-and-shot influence of field trials , but more so because trainers commonly discourage it . When allowed to flush , many dogs assume the command is coming anyway , so why wait ? This creates a serious correction problem , but there 's a simple way to avoid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to teach flushing on command , make up your mind that the dog will not get to flush every time . If you always let him wonder whether this time he gets to go , he wo n't flush without your say-so . Quick Tip SURPRISE SCENT POINT A pup might not know where , or whether , to point its first birds if the scent keeps growing stronger . So instead of approaching into the wind , come crosswind about 15 feet downwind of the planted bird for a sudden , strong scent that surprises your student into locking up .
