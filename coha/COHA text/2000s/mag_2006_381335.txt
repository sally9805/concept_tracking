The pious young scientist had a question about human origins and the attention of one of the foremost geneticists in the world . Standing up in a crowded Hilton-hotel conference room in Alexandria , Va. , the inquisitive Ph.D. - M.D. candidate asked Francis Collins , who mapped the human genome , about an attempt to reconcile science and faith : Did Collins think it possible that all species are products of evolution  --  except for humanity , which God created separately ? " Based on everything we know , " the young man asked , " would that tie together evolution and a literal reading of the Bible and make room for God to intervene ? " <P> Collins showed no surprise that a star scholar poised to contribute to the future of medicine should entertain the idea that evolution might not apply to humans . Indeed , the question was almost predictable , since the room was filled with Harvey Fellows , high-performing young academics devoted to bringing a Christian presence to fields where Evangelicals are underrepresented . And Collins , that rarest of raritiesa superstar evangelical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : A Scientist Presents Evidence for Belief ( Free Press ; 304 pages ) , was perfectly qualified to answer . He did . That notion " gets you into a series of real problems , " he replied . He sketched one out : the human genome contains nonfunctional elements in the precise spot where they can be found on the chromosomes of lower animals . If God was creating humans afresh , Collins asked , " why would he insert a pseudo-gene that has lost its ability to do anything in the same place that it appears in a chimp ? " Barring evolution , " you 're forced to the conclusion that God was trying to mislead us and test our faith  --  and I have trouble with that kind of conjecture . " <P> In America 's ongoing and sometimes rancorous discussion about science and God , some stock characters have evolved . There are the vocal proponents of creationism and intelligent design who storm school boards in hopes that either science or local government will conform to their beliefs . Then there are academic atheists who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proving religion a delusion . But few of the polemicists have the authority to preach beyond their own choirs . Most believers do n't care to listen to an atheistic scientist calling the idea of God a mythology created to explain what humans do n't understand , and academic atheists are just as uninterested in scientific lectures from Bible literalists . <P> Collins , however , has both the standing and the desire to promote a third way . At 56 , he is an unassuming 6-ft. 4-in. stork with a reedy voice , a techie 's el cheapo digital Timex and  --  his one touch of flash  --  a wide silver ring emblazoned with a cross . " I think the majority of people in the U.S. probably occupy a middle ground but feel under attack by the bombs thrown from either side , " he says . " We have n't heard very much about the way these views can be rendered into a very satisfying harmony . And I do hope that both camps are a potential audience for what I have to say .
