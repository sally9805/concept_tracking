<p> As the rock band begins to play and the teenagers crowding the front rows sing along , " The Rock " walks up the aisle to grins and welcomes . The kids , dressed in jeans and sneakers , show up at the Korean Catholic Mission of San Jose every Sunday afternoon to hear Father Jack LaRocca , 54 , tell them stories and bits of wisdom . <p> This week , he gives a sermon on Jesus and the apostles . <p> " Their relationship was tight , " he says in his thick New York accent . " That 's the word nowadays , is n't it ? Tight ? " <p> Suddenly , the priesthood is cool . <p> Like many members of the Santa Clara County diocese , the kids are glad to have " Father Jack " in their corner . The Long Island-born Vietnam veteran carries his Bible and vestaments to church in the custom leather saddlebags on his Kawasaki motorcycle . <p> He sleeps only two or three hours a night . He wrestles and lifts weights , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks his knuckles while he talks and the occasional " ai n't " slips into his speech . <p> But his most distinguishing characteristic , his friends and congregation members agree , is his ability to relate to absolutely anyone . <p> He 's memorized the Lord 's Prayer in Korean so he can say it along with the youth group . He offers a special prayer for this year 's high school graduates and then checks to make sure that the kids understand today 's lesson . <p> " Get it ? Got it ? Good ! " he shouts . <p> The teens pay him rapt attention , giggle at his jokes and hug him after the service . <p> " I like him ' cause he tells us a lot of his own experiences , " says Angel Chung , 15 , as the group starts to disperse . " It 's something real , not that he reads or something . " <p> James Lee , 18 , agrees , noting , " He does n't really try to say fancy stuff . He knows what 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valley would agree that LaRocca knows what 's going on . In addition to leading services for the Korean youth group , he leads Mass in Portuguese at San Jose 's Five Wounds Church , where he lives . He mentors an 87-year-old nun . He runs the Ascent Foundation , a religious nonprofit that campaigns for the rights of indigenous people around the world . <p> He 's counseled thousands of kids in juvenile hall over the past 10 years and publishes " Hard Rock Times , " a monthly newsletter full of jokes and advice for them . He blesses 4,000 bikers each Easter at the annual Motorcycle Mass . <p> " He 's , without a doubt , not a normal priest , " says Todd Pacioni , 31 , one of LaRocca 's " groupies " who travels around Santa Clara County to attend as many of the priest 's Masses as he can . " He 'll pull up on his motorcycle wearing his collar , and you 're just like , What ? This guy is a stud ! ' <p> " He 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continues , almost breathlessly . " People just gravitate to him . He can touch anyone at any age , at any level . I 've watched him rub noses with the highest of high in society and then talk to a homeless guy in the gutter . " <p> Pacioni , a UPS deliveryman who lives in Sunnyvale , met LaRocca 11 years ago . He 'd been raised a Catholic but was struggling to find a religion that would suit him better . <p> " Getting up , sitting down , kneeling , this stuff is n't making it for me , " he recalls thinking at the time . " There 's got to be more than that out there . " <p> In a last-ditch effort to find his place in church , he accompanied his father , who was dying of pancreatic cancer , to one of LaRocca 's Masses . <p> " I was blown away , " Pacioni says . " I was awestruck . I was sleep-walking until I met Father Jack . " <p> His devotion to LaRocca was clinched several years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counsel with their broken marriage . They had tried going to other priests , to marriage counselors and to retreats but had n't found any solace . <p> " Within maybe a half an hour ( of talking to LaRocca ) , my wife was in utter awe , " Pacioni says . " He basically did about five to six years ' worth of a psychiatrist 's work in half an hour . I 've seen him do so many things like that to so many people , it 's just unbelievable . " <p> LaRocca said he believes that he can relate to all sorts of people because of the many hats he 's worn before becoming a priest . He knew he wanted to become a priest when he was 6 years old , but he also knew he wanted to take a while to get there . <p> " I wanted to get as much experience as people themselves have had , " he says . " Then I could connect with them in the best way as their priest . I also wanted to never feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Raised by nuns in a Catholic orphanage after being abandoned by his unwed mother , he was placed with foster parents when he was 5 . His grades were poor throughout elementary and high school , and he took more than his share of woodshop classes . <p> After enlisting in the U.S. Army in 1966 , he managed a dispensary unit in Germany for a year before volunteering to go to Vietnam as an infantry medic . He received a Bronze Star in 1968 . <p> He was back in the United States for less than a year before reading a National Geographic article about the governmental oppression of the Montagnard , an indigenous group in South Vietnam . He traveled back to Vietnam to serve as a spiritual leader for the group . <p> Throughout the 1970s , LaRocca split his time between Southeast Asia and California . He helped the poor in Laos and Bangladesh and earned a bachelor 's degree in sociology and political science from California State University at Sacramento . He worked an array of jobs in California , including sterilizing surgical instruments at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ search firm . <p> In 1980 , LaRocca entered the Graduate Theological Union in Berkeley and was ordained eight years later . In 1993 , he received his doctoral degree from the San Francisco Theological Seminary in San Anselmo . <p> Though he works with many Catholic groups and sometimes leads as many as seven Masses on a given Sunday , he says he 's always felt the closest to teenagers . He counsels kids at the Santa Clara County juvenile hall , two boys ' ranches and a drug treatment facility . <p> " When I 'm able to change a child 's life , help them make a change that they need to make , I feel like I 've touched the future , " he says . " They absolutely enjoy looking at things with a different lens . " <p> He still remembers his first day at juvenile hall 10 years ago . He met with a 14-year-old boy ( He never asks the kids what crime they committed . ) . The boy asked whether he was a priest and whether he could confess his sins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bench , facing each other . After the boy finished talking , LaRocca asked the boy to pray for him since it was his first day on the job . <p> " Me ? Pray for a priest ? I do n't think I can do that , Father , " the boy replied . <p> But LaRocca talked him into it and the boy began , " This man here is a priest , and he 's come to work with people like me . Look out for him . " <p> " As soon as we finished , he got up and walked with a strut , and he never came back to prison again , " LaRocca says , smiling . " You have to find the drumbeat that they have and show them a new beat , a new rhythm . " <p> " Being from my background , you might feel sorry for yourself , but that 's what I 'm trying to teach the kids in juvenile hall , " he adds later . " There 's a bigger family than just who you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ backgrounds to know it 'll all change in time . " <p> He has a certain way with the elderly , as well . Mike Heeger , a retired businessman , first met LaRocca 10 years ago at Los Altos ' St. Nicholas Church . His wife was dying of cancer , and LaRocca counseled the couple until her death . <p> " He really took care of me . He was my spiritual shepherd , " Heeger says . " A lot of priests may go just from high school into study for the priesthood , and they just are n't as knowledgeable about the world . He just has a wonderful feel for people . In other words , he 's like you and me . " <p> When asked to explain the secret behind his seemingly magical touch , LaRocca shrugs . <p> " I 'm not working from creed , " he says . " I 'm not working from intellect . I 'm working from good , honest love . " <p> Send comments to hknight@sfgate.com.
