Hiking St. John 's lush trails , and snorkeling the idyllic bays they lead to , is the best way to explore the nation 's only Caribbean national park . // PHOTOGRAPHS BY RAUL TOUZON When the ranger said I 'd spot sea turtles while snorkeling in Leinster Bay , I figured , " no way . " Sea turtles are notoriously skittish , and my critter-finding luck is notoriously bad . So , after practically colliding with three juvenile hawksbills , their mottled shells hardly bigger than dinner plates , I let out a whoop . Even when my coughing subsides ( whooping underwater is a bad idea ) , the turtles stay close , letting me trail them as they graze the ocean floor . I 've come to St. John to indulge a favorite Caribbean pastime : snorkel-hiking . There 's no better way to sample an island 's surf and turf than by hitting the trail with mask and fins in your backpack . And there 's no better place to try it than in Virgin Islands National Park , whose lush , forested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exertion-and a wonderment of reefs and sea creatures . The park , founded in 1956 with land donated by philanthropist Laurance Rockefeller , stretches from coast to coast , consuming more than half of the nine-mile-long volcanic island of St. John , along with a sizable chunk of the surrounding waters . Thanks to the national park , St. John is one of the most protected of all Caribbean islands . Using a map of the park 's 20 trails , I cobble together a route that , over the course of a day , will let me sample the best of the north and south coasts with ample time for snorkeling the reefs . I start at a trailhead on Centerline Road , hiking downhill from the spine of the island into the Reef Bay Valley . Here , soaring tropical hardwoods shade a path originally used to reach a mill and distillery from which rum and sugar were shipped at Reef Bay on the south shore . Sensible Danes ( the Virgin Islands were a Danish territory until 1917 ) used broad , flat rocks to pave the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washing out in downpours . Park rangers lead tours of the Reef Bay Trail that get booked up weeks in advance . I go it alone , stopping at interpretive markers to learn of the island 's natural and human history . While admiring a towering locust tree-called a " stinkin ' toe tree " for its odiferous fruit-I hear a gleeful commotion up ahead : " Whoa , cool ! " " Wicked . . . . " I round a bend to find hikers from Maryland-two mothers and their three young sons-gathered at a giant kapok tree . Aboriginal people who once lived here carved canoes from kapok trunks and used the cottony fiber from its seed pods as bedding . When kapoks shed limbs , their elephant-hide bark heals in a gnarly way . The boys point out that the scar left behind on this particular tree looks like the mug of a grinning orangutan . I fall in with the Maryland group , and we soon veer off the main trail for a side hike to the park 's most mysterious attraction : the petroglyphs . Above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embankment of volcanic rock reveals a series of haunting , primitive etchings of human figures and moon-shaped faces with wide eyes . Most theories suggest the petroglyphs were carved by early inhabitants-but which tribe ? Tainos ? Caribs ? And why did they pick this spot ? Others argue that the petroglyphs were the work of escaped African slaves from the island 's colonial era or of far-flung Mayan explorers who came and went . One theory , seizing upon images of antenna-like protuberances , involves space aliens . Indeed , disagreement has been so strong that the park service has long refrained from placing any interpretive markers at the site at all . But the mystery may finally be solved . Ken Wild , the park 's cultural resource manager and archaeologist , tells me when we chat after my hike that he has compared the petroglyphs to others throughout the Caribbean . Wild 's conclusion : They were made by the Taino , perhaps a thousand years ago , before the Taino were forced off these islands by the fierce Caribs . A nighttime visit to the St. John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Taino believed that their departed ancestors entered the afterworld in the form of bats , " Wild says . " As I sat there one evening , the bats swarmed in to feed along the pools . It became obvious to me that the Taino created the petroglyphs in this spot to honor their ancestors . " Interpretive markers will soon be posted . Leaving the Maryland hikers to picnic by the bat pools , I head down to Reef Bay , passing through muggy stands of mangrove where tiny crabs skitter about in the mud and a white-tailed deer scampers across the trail . I wander through the ruins of the Reef Bay sugar factory , then slip on mask and fins for a dip along the sliver of beach where tiny reef fish dart around and a frisky stingray feeds along the rocks . I backtrack a ways to take the trail to Lameshur Bay and stroll along a road on to Saltpond Bay , where I catch the bus back to my car . To see the north shore of the island , I drive to Leinster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a beckoning crescent of sand . The afternoon sun beats down , and most of the other beachgoers are folding their blankets and leaving as I fin out toward Waterlemon Cay , a rocky spit just a hundred yards offshore . As I watch a toothy barracuda slice through a school of silversides , the hawksbills appear . I do n't know how long I hover over them as they munch on sponges and scoot about . It 's an interlude beyond time . Suddenly they 're off , arcing away in graceful unison . I follow as far as I can then watch them disappear into the deep-blue nowhere .
