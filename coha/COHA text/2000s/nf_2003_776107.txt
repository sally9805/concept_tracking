Introduction Today the Roman Catholic Church in the United States is on the verge of either an irreversible decline or a thoroughgoing transformation . // A few years ago , that proposition might have seemed melodramatic , typical journalistic sensationalism . Then , in the first half of 2002 , the church was hit with a gale of revelations about sexual molestation of minors by priests , and as the winds of scandal continued to howl and howl , it seemed that no statement about the Catholic Church was too melodramatic or exaggerated to get a serious hearing . My own analysis of the sex scandal , somewhat different from the standard versions , will come later . But the important point is that the church faced these rather stark alternatives of decline or transformation before the revelations and would do so today even if this shocking sexual misconduct had never occurred . The reasons the church faces major choices about its future , while not unrelated to aspects of the scandal , go even deeper , to two intersecting transitions in American Catholic life . How the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transitions will determine its course for much of this century . // That future is obviously of great interest to devout Catholics . It should be of interest , in fact , to other thoughtful Americans , and to non-Americans who recognize the place that the American church occupies in both the world 's most powerful nation and the world 's largest single religious body . The fate of American Catholicism will have a significant impact on the nation 's fabric , its political atmosphere , its intellectual life , and its social resilience . It will have a significant impact on worldwide Catholicism ; in short , on the world . // The American Catholic Church is a unique institution . In ways obvious or mysterious , profound or trivial , the Catholic Church provides a spiritual identity for between 60 and 65 million Americans , approximately one-fourth of the population . These millions are Catholic in amazingly diverse ways . For some , their faith is the governing force of their lives . For others , it is a childhood memory with little impact ( so they think ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll taker 's question , for want of any other religious label . There are Catholics for whom the church is the source of peace and joy , and Catholics for whom it is the cause of fierce anger and outrage . Not infrequently , these are the same Catholics . In recent years , if the Gallup poll is believed , approximately 30 million Catholics go to Mass at least once a week , although this total appears to have at least temporarily dropped by several million because of the sex scandal . Other measures put the number at Sunday Mass on an ordinary weekend at somewhat under 20 million . Another 15 to 17 million go to Mass regularly , some at least monthly , many of them " almost " every week . Even in the year of the sex scandal , half of the nation 's Catholics say that their religion is " very important " in their lives , and another third say it is " fairly important . " // The church spans the nation with its parishes , elementary and secondary schools , colleges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service system second only to the government 's . Despite the impact of the sex scandals , Catholicism remains a powerful moral force in a society with fewer and fewer moral authorities of any sort . // Like virtually no other American institution , the Catholic church is a bridge . Unlike the nation 's second largest religious body , the Southern Baptist Convention , or many other geographically concentrated faith groups , the Catholic church links regions : Catholic New England with Catholic New Mexico , by way of the urban Midwest - Cleveland , Chicago , Milwaukee , Saint Louis . What is more crucial , the church bridges races and classes , suburban neighborhoods and inner-city ghettoes . It links power brokers on Wall Street or Capitol Hill , whose grandparents were immigrants from Europe , with newly arrived immigrants from Latin American , Haiti , the Philippines , and Southeast Asia . // In Los Angeles , for example , the cardinal archbishop , Roger Mahony , has mixed easily with the city 's newspaper editors and Hollywood executives , but he is also viewed as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ archdiocese 's 287 parishes , Mass is said in thirty-eight languages . More than half of the Brooklyn diocese 's parishioners are said to speak English as their second language . In Holland , Michigan , the home of the tulip festivals and a daunting number of denominations descended from Dutch Calvinism , Saint Francis de Sales Catholic Church often greets callers with a phone message in both Spanish and English - and has a special monthly Mass in Vietnamese . // A church that embraces so many different groups inevitably becomes not only a bridge but also a battleground for the culture wars dividing American society . Many of the issues facing Catholicism mirror those of the larger society : anxieties over rapid change , sexuality , gender roles , and the family ; a heightening of individualism and distrust of institutions ; the tension between inclusiveness and a need for boundaries ; a groping for spiritual meaning and identity ; doubts about the quality of leadership . // The size and stretch of American Catholicism would have been unthinkable , probably even appalling , to most of the leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time of the American Revolution , the twenty-five thousand Catholics in the former colonies constituted but one-tenth of 1 percent of the population , and their church , in the eyes of many of their countrymen , embodied everything that the brash new nation was striving to escape . Catholicism was the hereditary foe of the liberty in whose name the Revolution had been fought . It was the seedbed of superstition and the sworn enemy of Protestant conscience , enlightened reason , and scientific advancement . Worldly , corrupt , and cynical , the Church of Rome was viewed as a stronghold of priestcraft , moral corruption , medieval obscurantism , and monarchical tyranny . New England piety and Enlightenment rationalism , however divided in other respects , could unite on this . // Those Revolutionary-era forebears could scarcely have imagined , certainly not with equanimity , that in a little more than a century , the Catholic Church would become the nation 's single largest religious body . On the eve of the nation 's bicentennial , Catholicism would be implanted in 18,500 parishes ; the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elementary schools and 1,600 high schools , 245 colleges and universities , 750 hospitals and health clinics that , along with a network of social services , treated or assisted over 35 million people each year . In many a Northern and Midwestern city , Catholic spires defined neighborhoods the way that Congregational , Presbyterian , Methodist , and Baptist steeples had anchored rural villages and small towns . // What would have assuredly baffled those first generations of Americans even more is the fact that by the middle of the twentieth century , Roman Catholicism , the once alien creed , had become virtually identified with Americanism . In the 1940s and 1950s , there was scarcely a more reliable indicator of being patriotic , it seemed , than being Catholic . It would not be long before the last barrier fell : in 1960 , John F. Kennedy was elected president . // Having confounded the assumptions and expectations of early Americans about Catholicism 's American destiny , history now did the same to Catholics . The church had won its vaunted place in the American mainstream by standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class values , but in its own way - at arm 's length and within its own all-embracing institutions . Now the defensiveness could be relaxed ; the permeable membrane with which the church had guarded its members could be officially dissolved . But barely had the American Catholic Church sunk back for a few moments of comfort into the soft upholstery of acceptance than it was thrown into turmoil . // The sources of that turmoil were both internal and external . First and foremost , the Second Vatican Council upended Catholicism 's theological and liturgical certainties . But it was the church 's fate that such an unprecedented effort at self-scrutiny and renewal coincided with all that was summed up in the shorthand phrase " the sixties . " In the United States that meant the civil rights struggle , the rise of a youthful counterculture , and the conflict over Vietnam . The civil rights struggle , although it began in the South , where Catholics were lightly represented , posed painful questions about widespread attitudes and practices to which Catholics had individually and institutionally often accommodated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban neighborhoods that had long been Catholic ethnic strongholds . Likewise , the countercultural revolt that dumped the gray flannel suit , " I like Ike , " and Leave It to Beaver for drugs , sex , and rock ' n ' roll struck hard at the moral restraint and respectability that the church had taught to waves of immigrants and their suburban children , sometimes as though equivalent to the gospel itself . Finally , America 's engagement in Vietnam , denounced by Catholic priests and church-bred antiwar activists , tore at American Catholics ' confidence that their faith and their enthusiastic Americanism coincided . // American Catholicism , in other words , would not have escaped conflict and change even if there had been no Second Vatican Council . Inner-city parishes would have felt the consequences of suburban growth and white flight . The religious patterns of immigrant subcultures would have been frayed by the educational and economic successes of the postwar generations . Catholic marriages , sexual mores , and attitudes about male and female roles would have been shaken by the pill , the sexual revolution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnified the theological repercussions of these developments . It emboldened critics within the church and legitimated new thinking that ultimately touched even the most intimate recesses of spiritual life . // Americans , regardless of their religious loyalties , were fascinated by the Second Vatican Council and by Pope John XXIII , the pontiff who called it against the advice of his Roman bureaucracy . The country had changed since anti-Catholicism contributed to the defeat of Al Smith 's 1928 presidential campaign . Non-Catholics had come to appreciate , although still with a trace of envy and foreboding , the size of the church and its place in their communities . At the same time , Catholicism retained for many people an aura of mystery , of the exotic , even of the forbidden or sinister . And for Catholic and non-Catholic alike , the church had come to symbolize unyielding permanence , whether interpreted as an anachronistic obstacle to modern progress or as a solid rock in a convulsive landscape . The Council suddenly revealed the church less as the unmovable rock of Peter than as the barque of Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ride out tempests , stanching leaks and undertaking repairs even as it navigated treacherous currents . // What happened in Rome when the world 's Catholic bishops gathered in four separate sessions of roughly two months each from 1962 to 1965 summoned up deep feelings about permanence and change , steadfastness and adaptation . Americans also realized that the Council and its aftermath had very practical consequences for their own society . Almost immediately it eased long-standing tensions between Catholics and Protestants and between Catholics and Jews . It promised to alter the tonality of the nation 's morals , to create new alliances in civic life , to bring new energies to neighborhoods. // Yet enthusiasm about ecumenism and " aggiornamento " ( John XXIII 's Italian for " updating " ) rather quickly turned to talk of " a church in crisis . " In the name of the Council , priests and lay leaders were demanding changes that startled bishops and alarmed Rome . Catholic scholars set about digesting two centuries of theological thought and biblical exegesis that church authorities had managed to keep at bay . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led a papal commission to urge a change in the teaching ; and when , after several years of suspense , Pope Paul VI rejected the commission 's conclusions , his 1968 encyclical , Humanae Vitae , only spurred questioning by the clergy as well as by the laity of the church 's moral competence in matters of sexuality . Theologians publicly dissented from official teaching ; priests quietly or not so quietly resigned from the priesthood to marry ; nuns shed not only their peculiar head-to-foot garb but , in many cases , their traditional roles as schoolteachers and nurses , and not a few left their strife-ridden religious orders altogether . // All these developments were accompanied by volleys of accusations and counteraccusations along with dire predictions from all directions about the church 's future . Church authorities had assiduously cultivated the image of a church united in its beliefs ; now that image appeared shattered by poll data revealing wide differences between the faithful and official teachings . As the sixties passed into the seventies , moreover , the fact that the church became a leading actor in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence that the hierarchy was losing its hold on the flock would inevitably be underlined . // No wonder the word " crisis " was so widely heard . Catholicism in the United States , perhaps as much as anywhere in the world , was being swept by conflicting visions of everything from prayer and morality to the nature of the church , even to the nature of God . The church was prodded and buffeted not only by social movements and political moods but , since 1978 , by a papacy that is at once dynamic in its leadership and conservative in its policies . // Every visit of Pope John Paul II to these shores , in 1979 , 1987 , 1993 , and 1995 , has been the occasion for taking the church 's pulse , blood pressure , and temperature - and for issuing ominous diagnoses . Yet each time , the crowds and the fervor marking the visits , combined with the documented reservations of many Catholics about the pope 's teachings , indicated how difficult it was to pronounce any simple verdict on the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
