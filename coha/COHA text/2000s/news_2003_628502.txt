<p> CIUDAD JUAREZ , Mexico - Fear stalks a generation of young women in this border boomtown plagued by a decade of serial murders and failed police efforts to stop them . <p> Many of the 93 young women strangled or knifed since 1993 were migrants from impoverished rural Mexico who had made new lives in Ciudad Juarez , across the Rio Grande from El Paso , by working in its many U.S.-owned factories . Some of the bodies found in stretches of desert around the city were those of high school students who had lived in the area their entire lives . <p> " It could be any one of us next , " said Mayra Maleno , 18 , an employee at one of the city 's assembly plants , adding that she ventures out alone these days only if she must . " We are scared and tense all the time . " <p> The recent announcement that federal authorities would intervene in the murder investigation , a move demanded for years by victims ' families and advocacy groups , is offering Maleno and many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killers might at last be caught , that the slaughter will end . <p> " Maybe they can do something , " Maleno said of the federal agents . " It 's good that they 're getting involved . " <p> Still , few seem wildly optimistic that the scandal-plagued federal police will have more success than state investigators . <p> " The police have never done anything real to solve these crimes before , " said Sandy Medina , an 18-year-old waitress in downtown Juarez whose dark complexion and slight build matches the profile of many of the victims . " If it is n't different this time , I do n't know who can help us . " <p> The federal attorney general 's office said it was entering the investigation because of suspicions that 14 women whose bodies were found between November 2001 and February had been killed for their internal organs . <p> Last week , officials said an American who may have bought victims ' body parts was being sought . They also said federal agents were examining the possibility that violent religious sects or pornography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All three theories involve organized crime and thus permit the intervention of federal authorities in the murder cases , which otherwise fall under state jurisdiction . <p> Many people in this city of 1.3 million fault state investigators for the length of the killing spree . In the 10 years since the first bodies were found , state prosecutors have put more than a dozen people in jail but have won the conviction of just one man , an Egyptian-born chemical engineer . <p> Maribel Ortiz , head of the Bring our Daughters Home victims rights group , said scores of young women remain missing . State police predict that the vast majority of those will turn up unharmed . <p> " I want justice , " Josefina Gonzalez sobbed as she spoke of her 20-year-old daughter , Ivette , whose body was found in November 2001 in a shallow mass grave , one month after she was reported missing . Ivette was last seen alive at an assembly factory , where she had been reprimanded and sent home from her job for being two minutes late . <p> A bus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ivette and seven other women whose bodies were found in the abandoned cotton field . But Gonzalez is n't convinced of his guilt . <p> He and another bus driver , who died behind bars , were detained just 24 hours after the grave 's discovery . They both signed confessions , which they later retracted , that were filled with contradictions . <p> Celia de la Rosa shares Gonzalez 's agony . Police say the body of her daughter Lupita , a 17-year-old high school student , was among those found in the mass grave . But the DNA of the dead did n't match that of her daughter , de la Rosa said . <p> " I do n't even know whether to retrieve the body , " she said of the remains that authorities insist are Lupita 's . <p> Stories like these have fueled a campaign by women 's advocates and human rights organizations to press for federal intervention . <p> But now that the federal authorities are finally getting involved , some activists are stunned by the new theories put forth . <p> " We 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , but not on the basis of this ludicrous hypothesis , " Ortiz , of Bring Our Daughters Home , said of the idea that some women may have been killed for their body parts . <p> A teacher , Ortiz founded Bring Our Daughters Home after one of her students turned up dead in 2001 . " We are very disappointed , " she said . <p> The idea of ruthless gangs kidnapping people for their internal organs is one of the developing world 's most enduring horror stories . In rural communities in Mexico and Central America , such fears have sparked suspicions , and sometimes lynchings , of outsiders . <p> So far , many here say , there is little reason to believe that Juarez will provide more than another chapter in the organ-snatching myth . <p> Doctors who performed autopsies on many of the 93 victims say they found no evidence that organs had been removed , though they admit that most of the bodies were skeletons by the time they were examined . <p> Federal agents in Juarez say their suspicions stem from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month that he had been involved in the kidnappings of young women for an organ-trafficking ring . He and two other men implicated in the statement , which the vendor later retracted , are now under house arrest . <p> " The smallest possibility that organ trafficking could be involved obliges us to investigate fully , " said Hector Garcia , head of the federal attorney general 's office in Juarez . <p> If the theory proves unfounded , Garcia said , his agency will turn the cases back to the state , perhaps with the real murderers behind bars . <p> Such statements nourish widespread suspicions that the organ trafficking investigation may be a mere pretext for federal intervention . If that possibility bothers the state police , legal purists and some activists , it seems like a superfluous debate to many young women in Juarez . <p> " Maybe organ trafficking is involved , maybe not , " shrugged Maleno , the factory worker , as she munched a taco at a street stand . " As far as I 'm concerned , it does n't really matter why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . " <p> In an effort to stay safe and keep in touch with worried families , many young women spend their scarce cash on cell phones . Some say they are nervous to go to a neighborhood store alone , and many treat trips to the bustling downtown area , the place where most victims were last seen alive , as high risk . <p> Myriam Hernandez , a 16-year-old high school student , said her boyfriend escorts her to and from the downtown market where she sells sunglasses on weekends . <p> " So many girls murdered . Sometimes I think it will never stop , " Hernandez said . <p> " It is very stressful , " she said of the mentality engendered by the killings . " It takes the joy out of life . " <p> <p> THE JUAREZ MURDERS <p> The victims <p> State authorities say 93 young women have been murdered in Ciudad Juarez , Mexico , under similar circumstances since 1993 . Many had been sexually assaulted . <p> Most were young and slim with dark complexions . <p> Most disappeared from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in February . <p> The investigation <p> Probe handled solely by Chihuahua state authorities for 10 years . <p> Now , federal investigators are looking into evidence of organ trafficking in the 14 latest cases as well as theories that religious sects or pornography dealers may be involved . <p> The arrests <p> Abel Latif Sharif Sharif , an Egyptian-born chemical engineer , was arrested in 1995 and convicted of one count of murder in 1999 . The verdict was later overturned . Sharif was convicted again in February and sentenced to a 20-year prison term . <p> When the killings continued after Sharif 's arrest , police arrested seven gang members and alleged that Sharif was directing the murders from prison . Six bus drivers were arrested and are awaiting trial . <p> After a grave containing eight bodies was found in November 2001 , two more bus drivers were arrested and signed confessions , which they later retracted . One died in jail . The other is awaiting trial .
