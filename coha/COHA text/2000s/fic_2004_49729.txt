EN LIGHTNING STRIKES THE OUTHOUSE IT IS ANOINTED . Haloed and shaken and char-dark , it is God-glad but not set aflame like the overhanging mulberry tree , and from that day it always smells like buttermilk and dead roses . We call it the Light House now and offer up our prayers there because Daddy is full-circle converted . He has nailed up the dump hole and propped in the seat of a ' 64 Dodge pickup . We keep a Testament on a shelf where the scroll paper was , but the black book is n't much use , as anybody with their mind on the holy can feel the scripture scorched into the boards . That 's what Daddy says . The quarter-moon slot in the spruce door lets sunlight bleed in , but it 's God Redeeming that makes every splinter glow . That 's where Daddy 's shout sermons come to him in a startle , so he should know . He also has hung-up a half-moon hubcap losing chrome , which he says is rusting toward the outline of the Jesus face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> We is my daddy John Crow Epps and my brother Jester . Also myself , Dock . <p> There was never any symptoms of flight in our family before , but now Daddy , whose black hair made him Crow , hardly scuffs the ground when he steps . He 's that lifted . <p> I wish Jester and me could rise up and float about . We have to work the sunflower rows on normal legs while Daddy preaches around or witnesses down at Sentry Park or some close-by camp meeting . When the spirit is on him , Daddy hot-wires the possum-colored rattletrap truck and 's gone most all day . It is not so easy for a pair of boys thirteen and twelve to run a flower farm alone . We have to stake some and string them , have to cut the suckers and cull the puny , spray against the aphids , white-flies , and Apollo moths . They are also prone to rust and mildew , so we boys hover close to home , doctoring plants , killing bugs , staying all sweaty and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every day here this summer we have to choose what goes to market with El Louise Swofford , who stops by everybody 's house who has a whisper crop . The cotton folks with big spreads by the river have their own rigs , and we gawk at them whizzing down Governor Toombs Road , which since the lightning Daddy says we should call Miracle Way . When Uncle Pre asks Daddy do you call yourself farming , he says just a whisper . So that 's us . <p> Even Jester knows the short bus El Louise drives is for the lame and halt , but in midmorning she totes beans and peaches , salt hams and yellow vegetables , red peppers , some food stuff in hulls , some tasseled . Eggs , too , and sometimes chickens . For us it 's just bouquet sunflowers and a few scuppernongs when they come ripe . We do all right . <p> El Louise is a hefty woman with cigarettes , using state gas to haul produce and fill her pocket . Her hair is hived up tall . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sticky paper and fill a poke . We 'll set them in the bottom of a scuppernong basket and see will they escape out to mess with El Louise . Jester says Our Savior would n't . He has been in the Light House too often to suit me , so I play-slap him and run off giggling into the crown rows of King Red Streaks . I know I 'm marked out to be more responsible , but it 's hard . <p> Our mother hails from Woolwine , Virginia . She first came down here for Bessie Tift Women 's College over in Forsythe , and I reckon she was happy once , but everything started going to the dogs a couple of years back . Then she did n't take to the Lord setting up shop in the piddle shack . From the day of the lightning bolt , she was sour and riled , sat half the day just gazing out at flash-by highway traffic . Was n't much go left in her , but Mama and Daddy took to scuffling even worse come evenings . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man with travel cases and eyes slick as a cold sky , but she climbed in with her lima-green valise at dusk about six weeks back and was gone in a swirl of dust . Not so much as a word . <p> Back before his being washed in the Lamb , when I guess Daddy used to smack her on the sly , I 'd see Mama 's face red as a blister burn , arms bruised church purple and gold . One night I was up to spill my water on the yard where I 'm salting a dandelion to death , and I saw her in the kitchen working the blue pump by the sink . It has a curved handle which seems like it 's too beautiful to be a tool , and 3-in-1 keeps its iron parts from owl-screeching . I always love to watch that pump work . On that particular night the water gushed out silver , and I tell Jester about what I saw when she stepped clear of shadow , her whole back and shoulders that yellow of a new bruise dawning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll have to kill him , but two weeks later we 're still plotting-lye soup or a gas jacket ? - when the storm blazes and the Light House is born . Not long after , she rescues herself in the Hudson . <p> Now Daddy is down at Jesus Wept Chapel thumping the pulpit against hell-bound sinners and unworthy women . He says plagues are coming , monsters about to be unleashed . He says there will come a swarm of weevils and a flood or maybe no rain ever again and sand whirled into a deadly rose . God has told him there will be suffering and gnashing of teeth and bloody sores . They all amen and raise up a hand . They writhe about shouting Kaluja ! or Yes , my shepherd ! and pass the plate with a flannel pancake in the bottom to hush the coins . <p> We have eaten our egg sandwiches and have shucked our gloves off in the shade . I am poking at a chinchbug hole with my weed . Jester has made a creel of wild grapevine and put his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lookee . Moses in the bullbushes , he says , all innocent in the face . <p> It makes me slap at him again and stomp his Bible story into a mess . I just do some things . I do n't know why . <p> Daddy comes back still cloud-walking from his Jeremiah trance , intoning on Og the King of Bashan and such , and wants to look at the Blue Horse notebook where I keep receipts from El Louise and all the running figures-profit and loss , halfs and carry-overs , spend-outs and owed . The Owl Producto cigar box hiding sunflower money sits under the roll top amongst the cubbyholes and pigeon slots with a mess of bill papers . He says money is the root of evil and keeps a mummy-dried bat on top of the bills to warn off any man jack with selfish notions . Daddy says God Himself needs cash in a steady river to further the Work , but I know he is drinking it . I found an empty Ancient Age bottle in the Dodge springs . It had the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if he has us get up with the rooster and cite the Green Pasture Psalm , he is deep into what Mama used to call " the medicine . " It do n't speak well for religion , I do n't care if he can step on air . <p> We stack them in a wagon , careful not to bend the ray petals . Jester sloshes the cut stems till we can tote them back to the cooling cans . Even the Shy Brownies and Oxblood brand look like somebody 's faces . Some are bright lion heads with star-point manes . Some are just beaming children . Daddy says Jesus is a sun god . You have to respect their joyful no-noise of soft color . They follow the sun path and are all helio-something-or-other , the Silverleaf and Primrose , Icarus and Evening Sun , the Ring of Fire and other soaring solos , as well as the polyheads like little Tom Thumb , which are yellow as store-bought butter . I do n't see myself why anybody with such plants like the eye of God over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I want is a baseball , a crate of Co-Colas , one ride on the Ferris , a little pet birch tree so its bark will hold on to light from the moon . A deep well and good furrows ai n't enough to keep a chap like me smiling forever . I 've got calluses on my fingers and lots of nicks . My shoulders stay slump-sore , and the stalks make an itch burn , but Daddy says just to use bag balm at night . I 'd enjoy to have a beagle pup and a glass-top showcase for my arrowheads . A bullwhip to crack at rats . Jester wants a Have Gun Will Travel cowboy kit with the horse head and some floss candy on a stick . We both want a book of fairy stories and a bike . Pan of fried chicken . Daddy says we are pagans . Remember the poor , he says , the miseried and starving . We should be ashamed . <p> It is after dinner , and we are sick of souse and butterbeans , boiled okra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pone cakes , tomatoes , and Luzianne water with no sweetening . It 's our mama 's cooking we yearn after . Fried drumsticks and pies , the sunflower loaf with black strap and fig bits . She could make a chicken that would put manna in the shade . He says we 're ungrateful and stomps out . Says we are heathens who would n't be happy with ginger beer and butterfly pie , says we are the kind that drove the nails in and stuck the spear . <p> Now clean ' em up , Epps , no idle hands , choppy-chop ! He means the vittle dishes . The vein in his right temple is a blue snake . <p> Now he 's holed up out in the Light House again , most likely with a pocket bottle , whipping up a new scare-'em sermon to reap any stray dollars that might happen along . He stomps and raises his voice in the holy closet . I would like to see the lightning come back and miracle again , so I am listening hard for thunder booms upstairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivering like a rattlesnake , mad . <p> Then one night he catches Jester peeing in the washtub , and we have to start trailing along to Jesus Wept to get our lesson in Good . Spending so much time pew-cramped and dozing upright , it 's hard to keep the farm on calendar , and some flowers are stooping , begging any Samaritan passerby to cut a bunch . Ducking work . Is that what they mean by revival ? We should feel lucky to get the rest , but I 'm antsy . Pretty soon we 'll be wanting to start barning the runts and other wounded flowers . About Christmas we always sell the seeds for bird snacks and roasting , the worst mealy ones for sow mix . Only Daddy has the trained eye for what we pour into the press and crank the handle to make helio oil , but me and Jes 'd have to learn it ourselves , if there was enough time we were n't down at the chapel . Daddy read the flower book cover to cover by himself and has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was dusty goobers , which will stoop a man bad and have no self beauty . Sunflowers were his plan to make Mama happy , a pretty crop against all the dirt and bland , but now he is just a prophet and a lily of the field . He is worshiping us straight to ruin . <p> Then Daddy brings home a soiled dove from Macon , says we should make her welcome . Pandy Cleave . She is a natural slattern-tassel blonde out of a bottle , a long jaw , eyes gray as gravel , and ca n't cook any better than me , but she has a Sears guitar , which is the beat of a tambourine any day . Now me and Jes get to stay home and do our job again . She sulls around the house and is no use , paints her nails and writes silly songs , and after supper it 's jibber-jabber , jibber-jabber , jibber . <p> Jester says Daddy thinks he can save anybody he wants . That man ai n't got the sense God gave a goat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that , or most anything that crosses my mouth when he 's out Bible beating . We 're trying to get used to her , but she favors those peculiar old Carter Family songs ands sings " The Storms of Jordan " tangled up with a murder ballad about Blackie . Me and Jester know better , as we had the plumcolored Philco , but I think Hudson Man thiefed it off . We did n't miss it for days , but who else ? <p> It all comes to a head now like a boil on your scruff . <p> First off , Pandy has taken to touching Jester on the gizmo . It starts when she is washing him like pretending to be our mama , and she tickles him and gets him all wiggly , but pretty soon it 's the middle of August and she ai n't adding to the work crew or giving much help in the kitchen . just lazing . Daddy says she 'll gallop on down to Jesus Wept fast as a thirsty jennet on the day when the Holy Ghost surprises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be what he calls available . The Holy Ghost is like something in a wedding dress you ca n't quite see . It will jump you from behind . That 's why there 's no point looking out for it . I wonder would she hear the call if it was to come . <p> I already do n't trust her . Things she does . Pandy thinks it 's fun to sneak up on most anybody , but she creeped behind me once in the coop and made me drop a handful of Dominecker eggs where they smashed and ran , three useless suns . <p> Mess with me and I 'll cut you . I have it out already , bright with the morning 's fifty stone strokes . Daddy said a dull knife ai n't no knife at all . <p> I 'll tell John Crow , and he 'll whup the tar out of you . <p> You wo n't tell him a thing . My eyes and the Barlow give her every reason to believe . Gleam . <p> But she has a hanker to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but then I do . We are out in the hillside rows , cutting a bunch of glory circles for a cash windfall order over from the Senoia Methodists , and I am trying to daydream butterfly pie . It must taste like slap-happy colors with sugar , food in a dream . A wind is breathing , and a hawk goes over , his X skysweeping over the leaning rows . Then Jester behind me breaks out crying and says Hell might be coming for him . <p> You never done nothing worth notice . <p> The harlot has me . I can see tears streaking the dirt on his cheeks . <p> Talk sense , Jes . What ? <p> So he tells me she rubs him , and his gizmo swells up a little , he ca n't stop it . She gets him once when Daddy and me are cleaning the seed press and once when I 'm in front trying a cigarette and haggling with El and Daddy 's as usual out Lording somewhere . Broad daylight . Now he 's afraid to go into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted to cuddle like a momma . She has a sweetness in her voice . You know that blue train-yodel she has like Jimmie Rodgers . I was took in , and she gives me pennies . Now I can feel the Devil crawling on my skin . <p> He reaches into his coverall bib and brings out a clutch of coppers . <p> I be damn . <p> I 'm about to explode , but I do n't hit him . I hold it in , knowing who 's to blame . Then I say we need to get something else on her . We need to blacken her name . <p> For three evenings we give off work early arid use the tall stalks of Gold Giants to hide our way back to the house . We are like Crocketts-field edge to the crape myrtles , run run run , the abelia shrub where our Joshua cat likes to doze , then up to the house , flat as shadows on the board and batten . Inside the front door I can see his coat peg is empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sears Roebuck music . No supper sizzling . I do n't know what she does all day . Then the third evening we find out . <p> She 's in Daddy 's and her room at the roll top , so Jester fetches the hubcap , and he 's on my shoulders , reflecting through the window . I know the room is mirrored up funny in the chrome , but he can make her out and motions me to set him down . The Jesus rust has n't much shaped up . <p> Pandy 's got the books , and she 's changing my figures with a pencil rubber . She has the Owl Producto box . Dock , he whispers , she is filching our cash . It 's on her lap over the rose print dress . I think she is robbing us . The bat is on the floor . <p> We crouch there and figure . She ca n't make letters like me . Nobody can , as I write a peculiar tilty hand and cipher a lot on the edges . How 's she going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught , Dock . He wo n't let her . He wo n't keep her on if she 's a pilfer . Anybody can see that . Could she really be that stupid ? <p> Not for long . <p> What we do n't know is she 's got a scissor lock on him . That 's what Uncle Brinson used to call it . Her night work has smoked his judgment . I find out when I try to tell him , and what I get is the wrath side of God 's message , the back of a hand . Blood leaking out my nose . <p> You 've got your momma 's demon in you , boy . You 're a born heathen . If there 's flower money missing , I 'll know who to look to . That vein again , beating . <p> He storms out the door and walks to the yard swing , where she is looking at the moon . Pretty soon they are giggling and drinking from a sack . It do n't occur to him to ask where she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie abed and wonder how to bring him back to solid ground . We toss about and scheme till their spring squeak comes under our door and through the walls , but then sleep comes on us , and then it 's time to perk coffee and hit the fields . I hear her in the back bedroom strumming chords while she pops her gum , and the Ford truck is gone . I do n't know if he 's told her I have borne witness . I do n't much care . <p> While I make us lunch buckets Jester taps the table in time with the coffee spurting up into its little glass bubble . <p> We have a hard day , Jes , lots of bunches to tote over , and a sight of watering . <p> I know , D , I know , but I do n't care for it now . I ca n't understand . Why do we have to work while Daddy plays Jesus ? It 's the Light House 's fault , that 's what it is . <p> I say do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scorcher coming . <p> When we trot down the steps , I can hear there 's no noise from her and Daddy 's room . I would like to see her chewed and spit out by God . Daddy says it 's a rule not to suffer a witch to live , but he would n't know a witch if she was cackling and stirring afterbirth and rabbit crap in a kettle . <p> It 's a rough one all right , a brain burner , and we have split hoses and a slow sputter pump to work with . The pump at the field heart ai n't a patch on the blue kitchen one , and we have to ram a hoe handle in so we can work it together sucking the water from a deep spring nobody has ever seen . At the spit head I have some stripped threads to fight with on a joining . The way the pipe wrench opens its jaws puts me in mind of the Godzilla , and that 's my idea of a God , I think , chomping up the doers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own family tree . <p> We break off to load up for El Louise , and she grins like a gator handing me a big fold of money to settle for the month . I stuff it in my bib so we can get back to what Daddy calls appointed toil . <p> Like always , I eventually get some thread cuts from twisting new pipe steel on , and like I say , it is a hard one . By noon I see Jester is flagging on me , so we take our tea water and biscuits with black bananas and boiled eggs in the shade of the flowers . I love to stretch on my back and look where the sky is blocked out by our giants . We have some tree helios out of rogue seeds , and the blooms are bigger than our straw hats . You could almost believe yourself safe from anything in the sky down here , like the world ca n't find you . It 's like sunflowers are your army of mighty shields . The highway is zooming by , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neither . <p> After I figure out Jester has got into poison oak and is scratching like a flea terrier , we head back to the house for calamine , but when we get there , something feels wrong . I holler out for Pandy , but no answer . Then it 's up the steps and through the house calling her name . It 's just an echo , and I 'm not surprised much , just like a hollow log , but I know where to go , and sure as judas , there 's the cigar box and bat on the bed , not a dollar in sight . I 'm in a frazzle . If he thinks it was me , he 'll be dangerous as a runaway crop duster . Still , I do n't have much choice . Where would we go ? <p> So I tell Jester , and it sinks the heart out of both of us . We chip ice and make big glasses of water to sit on the porch swing and watch for cars and trucks passing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something to eat . We sit quiet as bird eggs . The Bible says for everything there 's a season , but I 'm not ready . <p> When he comes , he bounds out the truck cab again smiling and giving out hosanna . I can see he 's got that air-walking gait again , but I hold up the box . all gone , I say . She 's done struck out . <p> She what ? She what ? The vein swelling . <p> He gets red as a pickled beet and , snort breathing , runs inside shouting her name . He must be thinking : just like Mama . Hudson Man . His usual angle of wrong . <p> Now he runs out the back and around the sheds yelling no-words and also screaming he has been touched by the she-devil . Jester and me just sit there , nothing else to do . She has loosed all the sins and horrors on the world . We just hope he wo n't turn it on us . <p> Then he 's back in the house again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kicking chairs and stuff about . Fling and hurl . The flatiron comes out a window , and me and Jester decide to get some distance . It 's like a tornado has set down in the house , and the smashing and splintering is like a twister , so we drag the ladder over and climb up top of the house , where it might be some safer . Pull the ladder up , just in case . We are still in the frazzle . We want to be calm , but we 're too scared . <p> When he comes out , he has his own daddy 's war pistol and is raving , Heathens and pagans , anathema the bitch scourge of God ! Kneel with me , sons , he says . Kneel and raise our mighty plea . We crouch down and do n't feel too safe , but he looks up at us perching and says boys , I 'll bring her back , I 'll get our money , I 'll smite and venge , oh abomination ! and a laugh like somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and gunning the engine . Coming to Miracle Way , he stops like deciding east or west . It 's west , and we watch him heading after the sun that 's going down like the king of the flowers . He leaves a swirling trail of rusty dust . From up here I can see our thousands of flowers in their careful rows , holes where the cut ones are missing , lanes for the sprinkler that 's spitting water feeble like a cricket . Out beyond , our crops-the acres of flowers waving , refreshed-give way to sweet corn ready for its last picking and then soybeans still growing . Farmhouses , yards , and the road seem like they 're glowing till everything in every direction just blurs with twilight and the worn-out clay 's haze . <p> Jes is slowly turning , shading his eyes like an Arapaho scout . <p> Do you reckon we 'll see him again , Dock ? <p> Come sleet , come gray wind , the world turning like it does , I expect he 'll show up with his tail tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whole . If he do n't show , we 'll keep the farm ourselves if we can . <p> Before long we figure it 's safe and run the ladder back over the edge . <p> There 's no weather clouds flocking up there , so I halt my steps on a middle rung and say up to my brother , I have me an idea . Let 's torch the Light House and be done with it . Kerosene in the barn . We 'll say lightning again if Daddy comes back . I do n't care one way or the other . I 've got eighty dollars in my chest pocket , and we 've got a heap of orders . <p> Then Jes says can we have fried dinner now , D ? Can we sacrifice a chicken ? <p> Pagans like us , you know . Jesus wept . I lock my eyes on a fox-colored hen , and we climb on down . <p>
