The Fork in the Road The final bend on the last road would take them to Beaumont . Father wanted to go straight but there was a fork in the road , so he stopped their old truck , packed full of their belongings , and got out to stare down each darkened , narrow lane . Maybe they were lost and they 'd have to turn around and go home to Michigan . Evie hoped they were lost . She rolled down the window despite the cold . " Let 's go back , " she called , but as she said it Father took several steps forward and disappeared into the thick fog . Evie waited , and when he did n't answer she sat up straight in the front seat , her heart pounding in her chest . She pushed at the door , but just as it opened Father reappeared piece by piece , his solid figure emerging from the deep gray . " Ca n't tell which way to go , " he said , coming back to the truck and leaning on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his padded gardening jacket and thick leather gloves , but his cheeks were red and the skin around his beard was windburned already . Cold filled the truck . " Fog 's too thick , and I sure do n't remember therebeing a fork in the road . " He scratched his chin and took the crumpled directions from his jacket pocket . He 'd gotten them months ago , before he 'd visited the property , scribbling them onto the back of a grocery list because it had been nearest to the telephone . Milk , eggs , peanut butter , whole wheat bread , take Route 71 east until you reach exit 7 , then go 70 miles on Route 77 . . . . Evie brought her knees up to her chest and shivered in the late October air . Her pant legs rode up her ankles , letting the cold sting her bare skin . The pants were too short , but they were the last ones her mom would ever buy her-the last of her pretty clothes with no grass stains on the knees from rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thorns . She would n't get rid of them no matter how small they got . She 'd tried to stop growing instead , but it had n't worked . Her legs were long and gangly , like a boy 's . Evie pulled her socks up as high as they would go and tugged at her winter coat to bring it lower . She peered down each road , only they both looked the same . Nothing but trees on every side , stretching as far as the eye could see-a thick forest between two great mountain ridges . The day was bleak , and the trees stood like sentries standing guard . The truck door opened and Evie 's father slid back into the driver 's seat . " I wrote down straight , ' " he said , pointing toward the crumpled paper . " I 'm certain it was straight until town . It 's the strangest thing . " Evie twisted her hair into a curl , but it fell flat again as soon as she let go . Mom 's had never done that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once , as if released by her breath . They spiraled into the fog and their calls filled the air like a thunderous warning . Evie shivered . " We should go home , " she said again . " We must have made a wrong turn . " She thought over the drive from Michigan to New York , and each turn seemed like a wrong turn . How could they move so far from Mom ? Everyone thought Father was making a mistake . Everyone . She 'd heard them whispering , and no one had come to help them pack or see them off because Father would n't let them . Not even his own mother had been allowed over . " I do n't intend to take help from the same people who are talking behind my back , " he 'd told her , but it had felt awful to leave with only the neighbor next door waving from his front window . After that there 'd been highway after highway and an overnight stay in a hotel that did n't have a TV and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was an adventure they were on , which was n't like him at all , but Evie only scowled and stared out the window , occasionally kicking the dashboard . Adventures were things that Mom went on , not Father , and they did n't begin at five thirty in the morning with a stalled truck that took half an hour to start and empty roads going nowhere . " This is all wrong , " Evie muttered , but Father shook his head . " Nah , " he said , " this is it . " His dark eyes flashed the way they did when there was trouble to be figured out . They 'd flashed that way the day he 'd told her about buying the land . Only seven months after Mom died , he 'd come to dinner all excited about a phone call from an old man . " Fifty acres , Evie , and he 's practically giving them away because the orchard has n't been producing fruit . People around there think it 's a curse , but they 're just superstitious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kitchen , waving his arms as he spoke . " They talk themselves into believing in curses and bad luck , but that 's just foolishness . It was disease that made those trees sick and it 's hard work that will make them better . " Evie did n't care whether the stupid trees got better . Why should trees get better when people did n't ? Even the old man had died not long after that phone call . She 'd crossed her fingers and toes that the deal would fall through , but it had n't . The old man 's sister had sold them the property instead , just as her brother had wished , and now three months later they were on their way . Evie frowned and stared out the window . " I hope we never get there , " she mumbled , but Father just glanced across the front seat of the truck and sighed . He reached over and smoothed the hair from Evie 's forehead . Her bangs hung in her eyes because Father never got around to cutting them-not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he always said . " I 've got a sick tree that needs attention , but I promise to do it tomorrow . " Except tomorrow never came and now the scissors were packed along with everything else . Evie pulled away and Father put his hand back on the steering wheel . " We 're almost there , " he said , real soft . " I 'd guess another five miles will get us to Beaumont , provided we pick the right road . " He paused , then looked over , catching Evie 's eye . " You pick , Evie . " Even now her stomach still turned somersaults . " You pick , Tally . " It was Mom 's job to pick . Always had been . Father said she had a perfect sense of direction , but Mom always said the wind told her which way to go . Evie could picture her mother getting out of the truck to inspect the fork where the roads met . She would stand still and tall , her spiraled hair pulled back in a headband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with all the pockets in them , and the thick leather sandals she wore all year long , even in the winter . Then she 'd wait , breathing long and full until she knew which choice to make . " The answers are always out there , Evie , " she used to say . " You just have to wait until they whisper in your ear . " Evie wanted to get out and stand in the exact spot where she 'd pictured her mom standing . The wind was blowing strong and seemed to have something to say , as if this time when Evie stood still , she might hear something other than deafening silence . She wanted it so badly her insides stung like scraped knees on pavement , but already she could feel her muscles tightening and her ears closing until even the sound of the crows faded into the distance . " Go on , " Father nudged , but Evie shook her head . Father 's hands gripped the steering wheel . Then at last he turned the key in the ignition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out long and loud until it seemed that all the air had escaped his lungs . " Left it is then , " he said at last . " One choice is as good as another .
