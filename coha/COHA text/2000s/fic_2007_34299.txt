I stuck the end of the pencil between my teeth , brushing the eraser specks off the paper as I considered how best to answer the employment application . What skills can you bring to Inderland security that are clearly unique to you ? Sparkling wit ? I thought , twining my foot around the kitchen chair and feeling stupid . A smile ? The desire to smear the pavement with bad guys ? Sighing , I tucked my hair behind my ear and slumped into the kitchen chair . My eyes shifted to the clock above the sink as it ticked minutes into hours . I was n't going to waste my life . Eighteen was too young to be accepted into the I.S. intern program without a parent 's signature , but if I put my application in now , it would sit at the top of the stack until I was old enough , according to the guidance counselor . Like the recruiter had said , there was nothing wrong with going into the I.S. right out of college if you knew that 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint sound of the front door opening brought my heart to my throat . I glanced at the sunset-gloomed window . Jamming the application under the stacked napkins , I shouted , " Hi , Mom ! I thought you were n't going to be back until eight ! " Damn it , how was I supposed to finishthis thing if she kept coming back ? But my alarm shifted to elation when a high falsetto voice responded , " It 's eight in Buenos Aires , dear . Be a dove and find my rubbers for me ? It 's snowing . " " Robbie ? " I stood so fast the chair nearly fell over . Heart pounding , I darted out of the kitchen and into the green hallway . There at the end , in a windbreaker and shaking snow from himself , was my brother Robbie . His narrow height came close to brushing the top of the door , and his shock of red hair caught the glow from the porch light . Slush-wet Dockers showed from under his jeans , totally inappropriate for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set down two suitcases . " Hey ! " I exclaimed , bringing his head up to show his green eyes glinting mischievously . " You were supposed to be on the vamp flight . Why did n't you call ? I would 've come to get you . " Robbie shoved a wad of money at the driver . Door still gaping behind him , he opened his arms , and I landed against him , my face hitting his upper chest instead of his middle like it had when we had said goodbye . His arms went around me , and I breathed in the scent of old Brimstone from the dives he worked in . The tears pricked , and I held my breath so I would n't cry . It had been over four and a half years . Inconsiderate snot had been at the West Coast all this time , leaving me to cope with Mom . But he 'd come home this year for the solstice , and I sniffed back everything and smiled up at him . " Hey , Firefly , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grinning as he measured where my hair had grown to . " You got tall . And wow , hair down to your waist ? What are you doing , going for the world 's record ? " He looked content and happy , and I dropped back a step , suddenly uncomfortable . " Yeah , well , it 's been almost five years , " I accused . Behind him , the cab drove away , headlamps dim from the snow and moving slowly . Robbie sighed . " Do n't start , " he begged . " I get enough of that from Mom . You going to let me in ? " He glanced behind him at the snow . " It is cold out here . " " Wimp , " I said , then grabbed one of the suitcases . " Ever hear about that magical thing called a coat ? " He snorted his opinion , hefting the last of the luggage and following me in . The door shut , and I headed down the second , longer hallway to his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small family again . " I 'm glad you came , " I said , feeling my pulse race from the suitcase 's weight . I had n't been in the hospital in years , but fatigue still came fast . " Mom 's going to skin you when she gets back . " " Yeah , well I wanted to talk to you alone first . " Flipping the light switch with an elbow , I lugged his suitcase into his old room , relieved I 'd vacuumed already . Blowing out my exhaustion , I turned with my arms crossed over my chest to hide my heavy breathing . " About what ? " Robbie was n't listening . He had taken off his jacket to show a sharp-looking pinstripe shirt with a tie . Smiling , he spun in a slow circle . " It looks exactly the same . " I shrugged . " You know Mom . " His eyes landed on mine . " How is she ? " I looked at the floor . " Same . You want some coffee ? " With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragged in up onto the bed . " Do n't tell me you drink coffee . " Half my mouth curved up into a smile . " Sweat of the gods , " I quipped , coming close when he unzipped a front pocket and pulled out a clearly expensive bag of coffee . If the bland , environmentally conscious packaging had n't told me what was in it , the heavenly scent of ground beans would have . " How did you get that through customs intact ? " I said , and he smiled . " I checked it . " His arm landed across my shoulders , and together we navigated the narrow hallway to the kitchen . Robbie was eight years older than me , a sullen babysitter who had become an overly protective brother , who had then vanished four-plus years ago when I needed him the most , fleeing the pain of our dad 's death . I had hated him for a long time , envious that he could run when I was left to deal with Mom . But then I found out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of my hospital bills . We all helped the way we could . And it was n't like he could make that kind of money here in Cincinnati .
