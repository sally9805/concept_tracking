John Negroponte , the President 's pick for the first Director of National Intelligence ( DNI ) , has n't even been confirmed for the job yet , but he is already facing serious turf battles in the U.S. intelligence community . One sign of trouble on the horizon : the Defense Department 's intelligence chief , Stephen Cambone , is having aides draft a previously undisclosed " charter " for his office that would consolidate his power as the DNI 's main point of contact for the Pentagon 's myriad intelligence agencies , which consume some 80% of the estimated $40 billion U.S. intelligence budget . The detailed charter appears to extend Cambone 's authority over such Pentagon intel units as the eavesdropping National Security Agency and the satellite-snooping National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency and potentially over the military 's human-intelligence operations . According to a U.S. official , the charter also seems intended to boost the Pentagon at the expense of the CIA . Cambone " would like to be a mini-DNI , " says a senior intelligence official . <P> With Negroponte 's confirmation hearings scheduled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is required to have a charter and that it is doing some streamlining to help the DNI . " I think it 's wise , " Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Warner says of the charter . " That 's not going to limit Negroponte if he wants to call someone else " at one of the Pentagon 's many intel shops . <P> But critics wonder why the charter was n't written long ago  --  Cambone took the job in March 2003  --  and say the Pentagon appears to be circling its wagons to ensure that it does n't lose any power . Says the senior intelligence official : " I do n't know how much this is Rumsfeld wanting one dog to kick within the Pentagon or Rumsfeld wanting to undercut the DNI . " <P> Another power struggle may be shaping up between the DNI and the FBI . Although FBI director Robert Mueller told Negroponte in a March 30 meeting arranged by the National Security Council that he is " open " to new ideas , a U.S. intelligence source tells TIME that Mueller has signaled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commission to bring more FBI intel functions under the DNI 's purview . At least Negroponte , who is leaving his post as U.S. ambassador to Iraq for the DNI nomination , is used to being under fire .  --  By Timothy J. Burger and Brian Bennett
