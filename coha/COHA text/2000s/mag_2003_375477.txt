Hillary 's Story <P> " Whatever Clinton may have gained through tasteful public confession she has lost by forfeiting the quiet dignity of a former First Lady . " GENE SAVAGE Sacramento , Calif . <P> The self-pity and narcissism in Hillary Clinton 's Living History are breathtaking BOOK EXCERPT , June 16 . Apparently she learned nothing from her White House experience . Clinton seems to regret that there was n't a depression or national disaster to help her ram the socialized health-care scheme through Congress . For the Clintons , citizens are just pawns in their game for political and personal power . It is clear that Hillary does not have the best temperament for the political arena . GREGG MCCONNELL Newbury Park , Calif . <P> Those who vilify Hillary overlook the fact that she was the first of the baby-boom generation to become First Lady . Like thousands of American women , she went to college in the mid-1960s not to find a husband but to find herself . And unlike Barbara Bush or Jacqueline Kennedy , she was unwilling to bask in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tested the limits of her intelligence and abilities to make a meaningful contribution to her country . DAVID M. PETROU Washington <P> Senator Clinton still does n't seem to understand why some of us supported the impeachment of her husband . For me it came down to two issues : Bill Clinton lied to a federal judge and lied to the citizens who had elected him . The questions in the Paula Jones deposition may have been " designed solely to trap the President into charges of perjury , " but I ca n't accept the idea of the head of the Executive Branch lying or in any way dissembling before the Judiciary . The far greater injury , however , came when Bill Clinton lied to me . ALASTAIR DALLAS Los Gatos , Calif . <P> We know that this is a woman who often got angry at her husband and his glaring weaknesses , perhaps even to the point of hurling objects at him . Hillary Clinton is a woman of political insight and ambition , with a sense of ideological clarity and purpose not often seen in American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feelings . There is a hint of dissembling in its triteness , a challenge to credibility in its sketchy description of events and an unspoken distrust of the public . Perhaps Senator Clinton did not intend for us to learn much about her life , or there may be things she is reluctant to admit to the public or herself . DANIEL J. HANNEMAN Maplewood , Minn . <P> I can not fathom the hatred for Hillary that burns in some conservatives . I am neither an admirer nor a detractor , but I 'd vote her into the White House just to hear the screaming apoplexy that would erupt from radio and TV " hate-triots " who think they own America 's heart .
