Craig Venter has no shortage of rivals who would love to see him fail  --  especially among scientists at the Human Genome Project , the multibillion-dollar government-sponsored effort to map every one of our 100,000 genes . When the millionaire molecular geneticist announced in 1998 that his company , Celera Genomics , would do the job in a third of the time at no cost to the taxpayer ( thereby making the Genome Project seem like a wasted effort ) , the scientific community was split into two camps  --  one group of researchers hoping he could make good on his promise , the other predicting he would fall flat on his face . <P> So it was with sweet delight that Venter announced last week that Celera had completed a rough draft of the genome months ahead of schedule and that it was on track to wrap the project up as early as this summer . Celera scientists now have 90% of the genome in their database . They have also captured 97% of all the known human genes and discovered tens of thousands of new ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least one new kind of interferon . " This is not only a monumental moment in Celera 's history , " Venter proclaimed in a webcast news conference last week , " but also in the history of medicine . " <P> Hyperbole ? Sure . But it may also be true . It is conventional wisdom among scientists that having the complete genetic blueprint for humans will transform medicine  --  with new classes of drugs , new kinds of treatments and new definitions of disease based not on overt symptoms but on underlying genetic defects . Armed with a patient 's genetic data , doctors may someday be able to diagnose diseases before they occur or prescribe medications custom-made to fit each patient 's unique genetic profile . <P> How can we reach this promised land ? Here the gene mappers part company , the scientists with the Genome Project having gone one way and Venter quite another . <P> The Genome Project , like the proverbial tortoise , took the slow and steady route . Scientists first divided the full complement of human DNA into 22,000 segments , each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully mapped , and then each was cloned several times . Those cloned segments are now being decoded by automated gene sequencers , and the process repeated several times to ensure accuracy and close any gaps in the coverage . Because each segment was mapped before cloning , the decoded segments can be easily fitted back into their original position in the completed genetic map . <P> Venter is using a faster but more risky method he calls " whole genome shotgunning . " He clones a genome several times and then blasts the clones into 60 million bits , each between 2,000 and 10,000 letters long . Each fragment is then fed into a high-speed decoding robot . The next step , for Venter , is the most difficult . His robots e-mail their results to Celera 's giant central database ( said to represent more concentrated computing power than anywhere outside the Pentagon ) . These computers are using a sophisticated program to reassemble the genome fragments into the familiar 23 human chromosomes . The whole process can be compared to making confetti out of a stack of encyclopedias @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
