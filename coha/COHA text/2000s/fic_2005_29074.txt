Girl , ( Nearly ) 16 : Absolute Torture By Sue Limb Random House Sue Limb Disaster ! Jess tried to hide her horror . Her mum frowned . " What 's wrong , sweetheart ? It 's what you 've always wanted . A trip to see your Dad ! I rang him about it last night and he ca n't wait to see you ! And there 'll be sun , sea , art and icecream ! Plus lots of interesting places on the way down there . It 's the holiday of a lifetime . For goodness ' sake , Jess ! What 's the matter ? " Jess could not possibly , ever , tell . She would rather run through the supermarket stark naked and farting than reveal her secret to Mum . This sudden fabulous surprise holiday was going to ruin her life , big time . Jess 's heart sank and sank and sank until it was right down on the carpet like a very ill pet . But she must try and sound delighted . " Nothing 's wrong ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But hey , Mum ! Thanks ! It 'll be fantastic ! When do we leave ? " She tried desperately to force a bit of enthusiasm into her voice , but it was hopeless  --  like trying to cram her bum into size 10 jeans . " We 'll set off the day after tomorrow , " said her mum , with the excited smile of a practised torturer . " Early . There wo n't be so much traffic then , and we can just potter gently down into the countryside . Oh , I ca n't wait ! It 's going to be marvellous ! " Mum 's eyes glazed over and she stared out of the window with a look of faraway rapture , as if the angel of the Lord had just appeared over Tesco 's . " Ruined abbeys ! " she drooled . " Rare wild flowers ! Bronze Age Burial Mounds ! " Jess sometimes thought her mum was slightly off her head . Maybe if her parents had stayed together it would have kept Mum sane . But then again , maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Start packing ! " said Mum . " You 've only got twenty four hours ! " And she rushed off upstairs , possibly to pack " Fabulous Fossils and Fascinating Cracks in the Ground " or " Sexy Sea Urchins of the South West . " Twenty-four hours ! Jess had to think fast . She had just one day to put an end to this obscene talk of a holiday . Could she become dangerously ill in twenty-four hours ? Could she discreetly vandalise the car so it would never , ever , start again ? Could she , acting with utmost care of course , slightly burn the house down ? She had to see Fred . Dear Fred ! He would know what to do . Perhaps they could elope . She had to text him now ! Jess raced up to her bedroom but  --  how cruel fate was - her mobile phone had disappeared . The floor of her room was covered with a kind of lasagne of clothes , CDs , books , and empty chocolate wrappers . Jess flung the debris @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses and just go round to Fred 's house without texting him . She just had to check her make-up , first . Jess headed for the kitchen where there was a small mirror above the sink , so you could stare into your own tortured eyes as you washed the dishes . Oh my God , her eyebrows were rubbish . They would have been rubbish even on an orang-utan . " Have you seen my teeth ? " came a sudden spooky voice behind her . But it was n't a spectral presence . It was only Granny . Actually what she said was " Have you feen my teeth ? " because when she lost her teeth she could n't pronounce her " s " s . She called Jess " Jeff " . This was slightly irritating . Jess was n't completely opposed to the idea of a sex change , but if she did unexpectedly become a male person , she wanted to be called Brad , not Jeff . " Have you looked under your pillow ? " asked Jess . They went into Granny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness , you are brilliant at finding things , dear , " said Granny . " You should work in airport security when you leave school . " Jess laughed . Granny 's teeth were always either in a glass of water on the bedside table , or under the pillow . Granny picked up her teeth and for a moment used them in a kind of ventriloquist act . " Hello , Jeff ! " she said in a squeaky voice she always used for the teeth . " What'f for fupper ? " Granny made the teeth chomp together in a hungry kind of way . This little cabaret had amused Jess quite a lot when she was younger , but now , quite frankly , it was beginning to lose its allure . Jess was desperate to escape and fly to the arms of Fabulous Fred . She laughed politely and backed off down the hallway towards the front door . " Let 's go and watch the news , " said Granny , ramming her teeth back into her mouth with panache . " There 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feared dead . " Granny was quite ghoulish in her addiction to catastrophe . " I 've got to go out , Granny , " said Jess , looking at her watch in an important way . " I 've got to say goodbye to my friends before I go on holiday . " " Ah ! Our lovely trip ! I 'm so looking forward to it , dear , are n't you ? We 're going to end up in Cornwall , of course , and that 's where Grandpa and I spent our honeymoon , you know . " Jess had heard this story approximately 99,999 times . Please do n't say anything more about it , Granny , thought Jess desperately , or I might just have to bundle you away affectionately but briskly into the cupboard under the stairs . " And , " Granny went on excitedly , " I 'm taking Grandpa 's ashes so I can throw them into the sea ! " Jess smiled through gritted teeth and reached behind her to open the front door . " Lovely , Granny ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Kind of like , The Afterlife is a Scuba-Diving Holiday ! " Granny laughed . " Now you must excuse me , Granny  --  I really must go ! Flora 's waiting for me in the park ! " " Oh all right dear  --  I 'll keep you posted on the Polish explosion when you get back ! " promised Granny . She trotted eagerly into the sitting room , heading for the TV . Jess ran out of the house and sped down the road . It had been a lie about Flora waiting for her in the park . An excuse to get away . The person she really had to see was Fred . Please God , she prayed as she hurtled off towards the sacred house where the divine Fred Parsons lived . Save me , please , from this terrible holiday ! Sprain my ankle ! Sprain both my ankles ! And please let Fred be in ! From the Hardcover edition .
