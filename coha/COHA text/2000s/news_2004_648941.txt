<p> Reggie Strickland , a middleweight from Indianapolis , fights once a month , often more . Though he is not without talent , Strickland has made his mark as a perennial loser during 17 years of professional fighting ; he has lost 260 of 344 fights , some under his name and some under pseudonyms like Reggie Buse and Reggie Raglin . <p> Verdell Smith , a welterweight from Bartlesville , has also established himself as a journeyman capable of providing an up-and-coming boxer with a challenging match that does not usually carry with it the risk of defeat . <p> Smith , whose record is 41-73 , has also fought under a variety of names . Eight times , he has faced welterweight Buck Smith , no relation . Verdell Smith lost all eight matches : twice under his own name , twice as Tommy Bowles and four times as Tim Brooks , according to state regulators and databases of boxers ' records . <p> " Fighting under different names is what we needed to do , to get paid , " Verdell Smith said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be coming up from here . " <p> Tomato cans , palookas , bums , stiffs : boxing has myriad words to describe these boxers ' singular purpose : to provide more promising fighters a chance to pad their records and enhance their careers . <p> They are the opponents who are summoned from out of town to serve as last-minute replacements , the trial horses fighting in preliminary bouts hours before most fans make it to their seats , the tankers whom prospects must punish to look good . <p> Sometimes , they may upset an opponent . But far more often they lose , and that is no surprise . They have been carefully selected by matchmakers and promoters to perform as best they can and to lose , preferably by a close margin . <p> " Outside of boxing , people will call it fight fixing , but inside of boxing this is the art of matchmaking , " said Sean Gibbons , a matchmaker and Verdell Smith 's manager , who acknowledged that he had occasionally climbed through the ropes to fight under aliases like The Matchmaker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's making a living . " <p> What some view as a relatively innocent mismatch can be construed by others as a rigged fight . Mismatches are among the subjects being explored by federal investigators , who for two years have been examining boxing and , in particular , one of its elite promotional companies , Top Rank Inc. , based in Las Vegas . Some members of Congress are also concerned about journeymen who travel the country and earn a few hundred dollars to take a beating , sometimes under a variety of names to escape the attention of state regulators . Federal law now requires fighters to provide photo identification to receive boxing licenses ; state regulators say it is now more difficult to fight under pseudonyms . <p> " The epidemic of fighters getting knocked out in different states under different names every other night just breaks my heart , " Senator John McCain , Republican of Arizona , said in an interview . <p> McCain is co-author of a bill that would establish a federal commission to regulate boxing and create national standards . Boxing is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The bill , approved by the Senate on March 31 , has gone to the House for consideration . <p> In boxing 's depressed financial climate , with unblemished records drawing a high premium , boxers willing to take on a superior opponent have been in high demand . That has made for peculiar economics : for some fighters , it can be easier to make a living by losing rather than by winning . <p> Many of these fighters maintain that they are doing nothing improper . They are not fixing a fight , they insist ; they are simply willing to compete against better fighters . <p> Bert Sugar , the boxing historian , is among those drawing a firm distinction between rigged fights and mismatches . <p> " Fixed fights used to happen like in old film noir movies , when you had a fighter in the tank and he would be told in the locker rooms , ' Kid , this ai n't your night , go down in the third , ' and his mobster promoter would make a killing on a bet , " Sugar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . We have the guys who are never matched to win . Silent offerings . " <p> Verdell Smith , who is 40 , has been among these silent offerings . He was once part of a loose-knit group of fighters who referred to themselves jokingly as the Knucklehead Boxing Club and who logged hundreds of thousands of miles on the road . <p> The way they tell it , a handful of fighters would squeeze into Gibbons 's hatchback and put on bouts in places like Bozeman , Mont. ; Goodlettsville , Tenn. , which is near Nashville ; and Bartlesville . They did it to collect quick purses , as many as possible . They would stuff cash they earned  --  $50 to $100 a round  --  into their athletic supporters to keep the money safe from thugs lingering around the ring , and then into their underwear before going to sleep to keep it safe from one another . <p> " We had to keep on moving , " said Buck Smith , who earned a Guinness world record for winning 106 matches in a row , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Smith fought 12 times , winning bouts in Kansas , Kentucky , Missouri , Indiana , Tennessee and Oklahoma . He once fought twice in one night , in different states . <p> In one stretch during the early 1990 's , he defeated a series of opponents who fought under assumed names . He beat Kenneth Kidd , who fought as Tony Taylor ; Rocky Berg , who fought as Rocky Vires ; and Tony Enna , who appeared as Tony Montesoro , according to databases of boxers ' records and state regulators . <p> The boxing business is different in the middle of the country than it is on the coasts or in Las Vegas , where full-time fighters tend to flock . Matches take place less frequently here and tend to be no longer than six rounds . The only way for a talented fighter to attract national attention is to compile a whopping number of victories , the way Buck Smith did . He retired last year with a record of 179-16 . Or they can establish a reputation as a worthy opponent , as Verdell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when fighting under his own name , is 41-48 ; he has lost an additional 25 bouts when appearing under pseudonyms , according to state regulators and the boxing databases . <p> The F.B.I. , as part of its inquiry , has questioned a number of the aging Knucklehead alumni , a law enforcement official said . Investigators have also been sifting through state records in Oklahoma for evidence of fight fixing and other crimes , like social security fraud , tax evasion and forging medical records . <p> " We 're looking at everything , " the law enforcement official said . <p> Gibbons , who considers himself a co-founder of the Knucklehead Boxing Club , said he was among those who had drawn the attention of federal investigators . Gibbons was reared in Oklahoma City and moved to Las Vegas to work at Top Rank as a matchmaker for preliminary bouts . <p> When federal agents first began conducting background checks on Top Rank employees , the law enforcement official said , they came across a 1997 report produced by state investigators in Oklahoma titled " Allegations of Fraud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report contends that Gibbons , working in concert with other local matchmakers and boxing agents , defrauded fans and skirted state laws by taking fighters under fake names to bouts in states outside Oklahoma ( once even using the name of a dead fighter ) . The report also said that Gibbons and other matchmakers had told fighters to lose in order to pad the victors ' records , creating " a carnival atmosphere " one step removed from professional wrestling . No one was charged with a crime as a result of the report . <p> Using fake names was the equivalent of using alter egos , Gibbons said . He denied that he had told fighters to lose , though he admitted that many of his fighters had only a puncher 's chance of winning , like the time he sent Ross Puritty of Norman , Okla. , to Ukraine to battle the former Olympic gold medalist Wladimir Klitschko in 1998 . Puritty , then 25-13 , stopped Klitschko , an undefeated heavyweight , in the 11th round . <p> " That was n't part of the script , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great about boxing . You never know what might happen next . " <p> Gibbons , who no longer works for Top Rank , said that while he was in Las Vegas two years ago , he became friendly with Frankie Manzione , an undercover detective on loan from the New York Police Department , according to the law enforcement official . <p> Gibbons said he had introduced Manzione to the insular world of boxing and had taught Manzione how to work a fighter 's corner as a second . Manzione began working the corners of Gibbons 's fighters while wearing a wiretap , the law enforcement official said . Among the fighters he worked with was Verdell Smith . <p> " None of my fights are fixed , " Smith said . " I just do n't like getting hurt , and I 'm not going to risk my brain and my kids to prove anything . " <p> " I 'm not in it for the recognition , " he said . " I fight , I get paid , and I go home , that 's all I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
