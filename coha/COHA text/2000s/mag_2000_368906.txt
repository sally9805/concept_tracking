In pop music , you can age like milk or you can age like wine . You can live life with a sell-by date , counting the days until everything goes sour and a new shipment of 2% takes your place on the shelf . Or your career can be like a fine Bordeaux , and you can make the kind of music that only improves as time goes by . <P> Backstreet Boys is n't ready for the wine cellar yet . But the group seems tired of being the liquid refreshment of choice on schoolkids ' lunch trays . The Boys ' new CD , Black &; Blue ( Jive ) , is a half-hearted attempt to leave the never-never land of teen pop for the always-always land of established pop icons . Two of the boys ( Brian Littrell and Kevin Richardson ) are married , and the entire group ( rounded out by Nick Carter , A.J. McLean and Howie Dorough ) seems to have more than puppy love in mind . You get the sense that , like most teen bands , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be more respected  --  basically they 'd like to be the Beatles . And pretty much like every band , they 're a long and winding road away from that goal . <P> Black &; Blue does not break new musical ground for pop , and it does n't break much new ground for Backstreet Boys either . From its debut with a self-titled album in 1997 , Backstreet 's music has always been a blend of cooing ballads designed for slow dancing at school proms , and springy anthems that bounce and tumble like beach balls on a hardwood floor . Black &; Blue offers only a slight variation on that very successful approach : the beats are n't quite so rubbery and the melodies are a trifle more subtle than they 've been on past Backstreet releases . But the core pattern is still the same : bring the fun on some tracks , bring the love on the others . Repeat . <P> The group tries to deepen its lyrics on a few numbers , striving to be more pensive and mature . On Shape of My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things I 've done , " and they deliver the line as if they 're looking back at decades instead of , say , a long weekend . On one of the more successful tracks , Yes I Will , they sing " Yes I will/ Give you everything you need/ And someday start a family with you . " Clearly the Boys are courting a new , more adult audience . And none too soon  --  Richardson , the oldest member , is 28 . Can songs about changing diapers , Rogaine and 401(k)s be far behind ? <P> So the Boys are changing , however slightly . The real stars of this album , however , are the marketers involved in pushing it . Besides Backstreet Boys , Jive Records has an all-star roster of pop performers including ' N Sync , Britney Spears and R. Kelly . All these acts have posted huge , headline-grabbing first-week sales this year . ' N Sync 's album No Strings Attached , despite pans from the critics , sold 2.4 million copies in a single week , more than doubling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are looking to top that with Backstreet.
