The MAN takes KITCHIN 's face in his hands , forces his mouth open , starts to blow into KITCHIN 's mouth . KITCHIN pushes himself away , falls down , quickly gets to his feet , and then makes a dead sprint for the staircase , scrambles up the stairs , exits . Over the following , the MAN starts to move from candle to candle , blowing each one out . MAN So , looks like my business is done . p. 58 SKRAM What about the girl ? MAN What about her ? SKRAM Do n't you want her and shit ? MAN I do , son . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gon na take her wif you ? MAN No . As a matter of fact , I 'm not . Actually , I 'm not going to take her with me . SKRAM Why not ? MAN Why not ? SKRAM Yeah , G , why the fuck not ? You came all this way . Oswego 's like a forty-five-minute drive and shit . MAN Oh , I do n't drive . I fly . Everywhere . Over the hills . Over the dells . Over the firelight . I rarely use my legs . That 's why I have such a hard time walking . My work is done . She 's all yours now . SKRAM I do n't want that little ho . MAN Oh , but I think you do . SKRAM What the fuck am I sposed to do wif her ? After the MAN finishes blowing out the last candle , he starts to leave . Just as he reaches the foot of the stairs : SKRAM Yo , I do n't want her , Ozzie ! The MAN stops , turns . p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Larry.Not Johnny or Dellwood or Gerald or Gary.He was bright as the sky and shiny as tin.He had a mother so fat , and a brother so thin . They lived in a house on Blueberry Lane.A house made of bread and old candycane . Mother was sad , her face long as the Nile.It showed in her eyes and her upside-down smile . She was hungry as mice but there was nothing to eat.Not a speck in the fridge , not a crumb on the street . Then one day she started eating the walls ! After all they were bread , not stone nor brick stalls.She thought , The wall in the kitchen might taste pretty good.It might be delicious ! I should eat it , I should ! So she ate through the wall , she made a big hole.She had to act fast , the boys could n't know.She looked through the hole and what did she see ? People to know and places to be ! She could fly to Japan or sail in a boat ! She could jump in the sea and just simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a tall tree ! There were horses and spaceships and magic TV ! That night while the boys were sleeping and dreamingshe jumped through the wall and ran away screaming.Beyond the Old Sea . Past the last train.Far from their house on Blueberry Lane . When Larry awakened he searched for their mother.It was high time to feed his big baby brother.She was n't here . She was n't there.She was n't up or down.Mommy ! , Larry called , but Mommy could n't be found . A month went by . And then two more.And then another  --  that made four ! It was scarybut Larry was brave as a bear.But the food was all gone , they could n't eat air . So just like their mother , they began eating the house.They nibbled it raw with the speed of a mouse.Walls made of bread  --  still a couple of those.One by the sink and one by the stove . But after a while there was nothing but holes.Nothing but holes for the wind and the crows . So they left their old place on Blueberry Lane.They walked to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river , slept under trees , ate beetles and snowballs and old dirty leaves . The MAN hands a tube of glue to SKRAM , gently seats him in the wheelchair . p. 60 MAN One day in June they saw a woman walk by.Did she look familiar ! Familiar , oh my ! She was fat as a whale and , my , did she wiggle ! She waddled so fast , her whole body jiggled . Momma ! Larry screamed . It 's Mommy ! It 's Mother ! She 's come back to get us , Big Baby Brother ! Larry knelt down and prayed at her feet.Mommy , oh Mommy . Dear Mommy My Sweet.Where did you go ? ! We 've had nothing to eat . He hugged her and squeezed her , and tickled her nose.He kissed her fat , all ten of her toes.But Mommy was hungry , she had nothing for Larry.She kicked him , slapped him , and goddamn it was scary . Poor little Larry lay heaped in the road.And his miserable heart shrank small as a toad.Big Baby Brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a stump in the ground.Mommy ! , he tried , but nothing was said.And since that sad day , his poor voice was dead . SKRAM starts to cry . MAN Away Mother walked , fat as a hog.Big Baby Brother lay long as a log.It was getting so late , there was nowhere to go.There would be rain and cold wind and blizzards of snow . Their stomachs would howland where would they sleep ? It was a sad little time.Too sad to weep . The MAN embraces SKRAM tenderly . SKRAM continues crying . The MAN takes SKRAM 's face in his hands and kisses his mouth for a long moment . They both keep their eyes open . It is a transaction more than anything sexual . p. 61 MAN Go to her , my little friend . Simply go to her . You 'll know what to do . The MAN crosses to his things , slowly gathers his wheelchair , folds it , leaves the suitcase full of money . He ascends the stairs with his wheelchair , exists . SKRAM takes off the pumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the stairs , sprints to the window , peers out , jumps down , then starts to pace around the room . His pacing gains velocity , like that of a wild animal trapped in a cage . After a moment he crosses to STARGYL , stands over him for a moment , drags him out from behind his shrine of plastic army men . STARGYL attempts to get away . SKRAM kicks him in the face , then starts to beat him on the floor . It ends with SKRAM kicking STRAGYL in the ribs . STARGYL is crouched in the center of the basement , his hands shielding his head . SKRAM reaches under STARGYL 'S shirt and removes the shoelace necklace with the key , then the revolver from his leg . SKRAM crosses to the entrance to the boiler room , inserts the key , turns it , removes the lock . He opens the door , stands in the entrance for a long moment . He then unscrews the top to the glue , snorts it , staggers a bit , drops the tube of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open . The sound of loud thunder . The sound of flies buzzing . Two gunshots . The faint sound of fire crackling . STARGYL slowly rises off the floor , crosses back to his corner , stands . The sound of the flies buzzing grows louder . Slow footfalls can be heard descending the stairs . Moments later , KITCHIN appears . He is drenched from the rain and there are ruptured flies all over his football jersey . He is holding a large , white offertory candle , a small flame burning at the top . He stands very still for a moment . p. 62 KITCHIN The flies is everywhere , Stargyl . Like pepper falling from the sky . Buzzin all in your mouth . Your eyes . The holes in your nose.I run over to St. Jack 's . Run like there 's rain burnin through my blood . Never run so fast in my life . My legs is just goin wild . Think if I run fast enough it 'll make that wind leave my stomach . Make them cats stop cryin.I get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nobody in the pews . Not even no birds swoopin down . Thought niggas might be standin in fronta the fans . Thought the flies woulda drove folks inside . But it was mad empty , yo . The way shit is empty when all you can hear is the sound of your own blood movin through you . The blue Jesus just starin back at you like he hungry.So I scream . I 'm like , " Where 's everybody at ? ! " I 'm like , " Yo , God ! Yo , God , where is you , G ? ! " But there ai n't no answer . Only the sound of them flies buzzin . So I grab a candle . Big white one right off the altar . And I set St. Jack 's on fire , Stargyl . The cross . The pews . All the pictures . Fire burns up the walls like little hands runnin . Windows pop . Flames shoot right through the roof.Thought God would see it . Hear them windows poppin . See them birds burnin . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Like that shit did n't even happen . It 's like that nigga 's asleep . The faint sound of fire crackling . SKRAM appears in the entrance to the boiler room , holding the revolver . His eyes are huge , ghostly . p. 63 SKRAM Hey , Kitchin You ready to break north and shit ? No response . SKRAM Let 's go , yo . Get the fuck outta here . Just you and me , G. SKRAM points to STARGYL . SKRAM Leave that nigga here . KITCHIN does n't move . SKRAM C'm on , Kitchin . KITCHIN does n't move . SKRAM What 's up , G ? Kitchin does n't move . SKRAM You ai n't comin ? KITCHIN shakes his head . SKRAM You ai n't ? KITCHIN shakes his head . SKRAM Yo , you know that shit Ozzie showed you . That shit that was in his mouth ? KITCHIN nods . SKRAM Well , I got it now . See ? SKRAM opens his mouth very wide and shows KITCHIN . KITCHIN is filled with sorrow . SKRAM closes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want some ? KITCHIN shakes his head . p. 64 SKRAM You sure ? No response . SKRAM Punk-ass nigga . SKRAM crosses to STARGYL , pulls his Timberland boots off of STARGYL 'S feet , puts them back on , crosses to the suitcase , closes it , grabs the handle . SKRAM crosses to the staircase , ascends the stairs slowly . SKRAM stops , turns to STARGYL . SKRAM Yo , Stargyl , you see Mommy tell her I said she a ho . SKRAM exits up the stairs with the suitcase , The light starts to flicker . STARGYL crosses to the center of the room with the milk carton boat , sets it down , then crosses the entrance to the boiler room , exits . KITCHIN crosses to the center of the room , sets the offertory candle down , kneels beside it . STARGYL re-enters with a life-sized little girl doll cradled in his arms . She is dressed identically to the GIRL who visited STARGYL toward the end of Act I. Her eyes have been shot out . STARGYL sets her in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STARGYL grabs the beach pail , places KITCHIN 's hand in the water .

The sound of fire can be heard crackling in the streets .                                                                                                                  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
