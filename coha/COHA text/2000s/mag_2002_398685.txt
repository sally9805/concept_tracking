On December 7 , 1941 , Arthur Lee was awakened by the sounds of explosions that signaled the beginning of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor . Headnote The Recollections of Arthur R. Lee Photograph // ARTHUR LEE , A 14-YEAR-OLD STUDENT , was sound asleep in Officers ' Quarters B at the Naval Ammunition Depot NAD , West Loch , Territory of Hawaii . He was living with Chief Warrant Gunner John E. Rutherford and his wife , Cosette . The Rutherfords were close family friends who had become legal guardians to Arthur and his younger brother in 1939 when their parents divorced . With the aid of personal letters written by men who had been serving aboard the USS Pyro , a naval vessel moored nearby , Lee recently recounted what happened that fateful day . Gunner Rutherford immediately dressed and ran out the door . His job was to supervise the handling of the 14  --  and 16-inch projectiles for several battleships at Pearl Harbor , and he thought the ammunition in storage was exploding . Expecting the worst , we looked out our windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . We were surprised to see that the explosions were n't coming from the NAD . Instead , we saw a thick column of black smoke billowing up to the east from Pearl Harbor . Explosions were growing more intense and frequent . We could see airplanes flying in circles above . My father , Chief Warrant Machinist Harry C. Lee , was with us . ... He said , " This must be the army exercise they have been talking about , but they sure are making it look real . Sunday is a crazy time to have it . " As he spoke , an airplane begin heading in our direction .

Above : USS Nevada under attack , as depicted by artist Robert Taylor . // The aircraft dropped below treetop level at the Waipio peninsula and skimmed over the water toward our quarters on a bluff overlooking the bay at the western end of the harbor . We stood on the porch , watching the plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had thick wings with strange projections like speed or dive brakes mounted on the lower surfaces . Heavy fixed landing gear with large , prominent , bulbous wheel fairings hung beneath each wing . The fuselage was thick , long and topped by a glass-paneled canopy . Just forward of the pilot was a telescopic bombsight . I watched briefly before my father yelled at us to get in the house . This was no war game . The aircraft bore straight on , and there was no mistaking its intent ; it was strafing us . As it got closer , I strained to see the crewmembers-men trying to kill us-but there was n't time to stand around . We huddled on the cement steps of our quarters , trying to make smaller targets of ourselves as we crawled in through the door . The plane 's erratic maneuvers caused it to veer slightly off course . Missing us , it roared close over the roof of the house , guns still firing . The machine guns made a peculiar sound , a sort of highpitched popping and whistling combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bullets passing out of the gun muzzles . There was no doubt in our minds that the pilot was distracted from his strafing run by accurate gunfire from an American ship docked at West Loch . By 0830 hours , the sky was blood red as early morning sunlight filtered through the dense black smoke pouring from burning ships . We watched anti-aircraft guns of the stricken U.S. fleet finally began to fire and hit attacking fighters . Although Mrs. Rutherford kept us within the comparative safety of our quarters , we did see one Japanese fighter plunge into the largest concentration of smoke . The plane was consumed in bright , orange-yellow flames nearly twice the length of the fuselage . For nearly two hours we heard aircraft passing overhead at low altitude and high speed , always with guns firing . Soon the strange new sound of being shot at became familiar : I will never forget it . As more and more American sailors manned anti-aircraft guns , the sky filled with the round black puffs of 3- and 5-inch projectiles . Shells bursting close by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drum . Hot shrapnel and spent bullets rained on our house and lawn . MUCH OF THE ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE was coming from the ammunition ship USS Pyro , which was moored alongside the dock at West Loch . Her flat-sided hull , vertically straight bow , and big , flaring overhanging counter were characteristic of ships built early in the century . Built in 1918 at the Navy Yard , Puget Sound , Washington , and decommissioned in 1924 , the Pyro was inactive for 15 years until she was re-commissioned to serve the Pacific Fleet once again . On December 6-7 , the Pyro was off-loading ammunition destined for battleships , including the USS Nevada , to replace shells that had been fired during gunnery practice . My younger brother and I had watched many loading operations previously while we fished from the dock . Sometimes , the sailors on ammunition working parties would talk to us , even show us how to tie knots or splice manila rope . Because we were dependents of Gunner Rutherford , ship 's officers often invited us aboard for evening movies or wardroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ December 7 , Pyro was in the most perilous position of her career . She was now half-loaded . Much of her cargo was sitting on the dock-row after row of 14- and 16-inch projectiles lined up for transfer . Each section was marked with signs displaying ships ' names : Arizona , Nevada , California , Maryland and Tennessee . On the dock , under Pyro 's cranes , sat rail cars loaded with silver cans filled with projectiles and powder . Tied at Pyro 's stern were three large covered lighters filled with powder bags for battleship guns . As on most ships on any peacetime Sunday morning in port , holiday routine was being observed . With the exception of those on watch and a few late sleepers from the midwatch , the crew was at breakfast . A couple of crewmembers heard the approaching low-level air attack . They watched Japanese Kates , Vals and Zeros fly past on their way to the main anchorage at Pearl Harbor , less than two miles away . At the same time , other groups of attacking aircraft were already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helpless vessels . The time was 0750 . A couple of old Asiatic Fleet sailors recognized the insignia of the Japanese Navy . " They 're Japs ! " they excitedly exclaimed . Down below , sailors were surprised by the sound of nearby explosions . Carpenters Mate 3rd Class Ira Thornton had returned the night before from a two-week , .50-caliber machine gun school where he had scored 480 hits out of a possible 500 . He asked a shipmate if he thought the Marines were drilling , but there was n't time to answer . The captain , Commander Nicholas Vytlacil , had also seen the aircraft . He ordered general quarters . Men ran to their battle stations , a rare occurrence for a naval ship in port in peacetime . Thornton 's battle station was the .50-caliber machine gun on the port side of the Pyro 's bridge . He could see planes diving and bombing ships in Pearl Harbor . As he pulled the canvas cover off his gun , he saw a tremendous explosion as the Arizona blew up . " The Japs were strafing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sick .... My quartermaster loader and I had to get the firing pin out of the ready box and into the gun . We always kept it out in peacetime . Just as we got the gun ready , a bomber commenced a run on the ship . I had a good vantage point and a clear field of fire on him , but we only kept a few rounds of ammunition in the ready box , so I had to make every shot count . As the plane got closer , I started firing at the propeller and worked the stream of bullets aft . I saw the pilot lift up in his seat as my hits centered on the cockpit . He dropped his bomb outboard , in the water , missing the ship , then crashed in the sugarcane fields off our port quarter .

Photograph Left : The USS Pyro was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Loch . Above : USS Nevada under attack , as depicted by artist Robert Taylor . // Ira Thornton was n't the only person in his family who was firing a gun . His brother , a gunner 's mate 2nd class , was manning the aft 3-inch anti-aircraft gun with Battery Gunner WE Gadberry and Gunner 's Mate 3rd Class Robert Burston . Burston had been breakfasting with his buddy , Boatswain 's Mate 2nd Class E.E . Wootten , when the attack began . Wootten , who had also seen duty with the Asiatic Fleet , identified the aircraft as Japanese and alerted men on the mess decks . Burston ran to his battle station , a 5inch surface gun . He later remembered , " We could n't elevate the gun above ... 30 degrees to be an effective anti-aircraft battery so we were ordered to help with the two aft 3-inch guns . We had a circle of loaders around both guns so we were able to rapid fire on any clear bearing . Unfortunately , the firing sectors of both 3-inch guns were blocked by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the aircraft to pass aft of midships before we could fire . " The crew broke out ammunition from the magazine below the mess decks . Fireman 2nd Class Loren Powers and Seaman 1st Class Erie Summers joined the long lines of handlers winding up through the various deck levels and kept a steady flow of ammunition up to the bridge and boat deck guns . Several .30  --  caliber World War I Lewis machine guns were also fired . Coxswain Bruce Rothe had served 30 months on Asiatic duty before joining Pyro , so he recognized the red " Rising Sun " insignia on the wings and fuselages of attacking aircraft . His battle station was gun captain on the 3-inch anti-aircraft gun mounted aft , on the starboard deck . " A torpedo plane headed toward the ship but only strafed us , " Rothe recalled . " We think the pilot must have thought we were an old merchant marine freighter as we had not hoisted colors . He probably did n't want to waste a torpedo on us . " Shipfitter 3rd Class Donald Green was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it , " Green recalled . " We saw another Jap flying low from our bow toward the stern in a dive-bombing run . I could even see the pilot 's face . The plane swerved to the right and the bomb came out of the plane . When I saw the bomb drop I could n't help myself and started to run . Then I thought about what a ridiculous idea that was and stopped . We could n't escape far enough on our ship ! A hit on all that ammunition would have been the end of us and everyone else around . " A stream of .50-caliber bullets from Ira Thornton 's gun had caused the dive-bomber to " swerve . " " My loader , a quartermaster , asked if he could shoot for a while so I let him . He was firing the gun when we spotted a plane diving for the ship . My loader opened up and shot one of our radio antennas and the flag halyard down . But the shooting was right at the airplane and must have caused the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wrong time . I saw the plane in flames . " The bomb passed diagonally over the ship and struck the dock about 12 feet from the hull . It passed through the reinforced concrete pier and exploded underneath , mushrooming the dock up and leaving a gaping hole approximately 20 feet across . The short but effective fight of the Pyro 's crew may well have saved not only the ship , but our lives as well . The only casualty was Battery Gunner Gadberry , who lost a fingertip when he tried to unjam a 3-inch gun . Whether or not Pyro 's gunners shot down two aircraft will never be determined . Official reports credit its men with damaging a single plane . However , they warded off Pyro 's attackers and played an important if little-known part in Pearl Harbor 's overall defense , and the defense of NAD at West Loch . <p>
