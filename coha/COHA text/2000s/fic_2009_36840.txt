1983 <p> November 16 : <p> I went to Missouri , and learned the truth . And from her , I met Fletcher Gable , who gave me this book and said : " Write everything down . " That 's what Fletcher told me , like this new life is a school and I 'll flunk out if I do n't have good notes . Only if I flunk out of this school , I 'll be dead . And the boys will be orphans . So I 'm going to go back to where this started . <p> Two weeks ago , my wife was murdered . I watched her die , pinned to the ceiling of Sammy 's room , blood dripping onto his cradle until she burst into flames  --  looking at me as she died . The week before that , we were a normal family . . . eating dinner , going to Dean 's T-ball game , buying toys for baby Sammy . But in an instant , it all changed . . . When I try to think back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel like I 'm going crazy . Like someone ripped both my arms off , plucked my eyes out . . . I 'm wandering around , alone and lost , and I ca n't do anything . <p> Mary used to write books like this one . She said it helped her remember all the little things , about the boys , me . . . I wish I could read her journals , but like everything else , they 're gone . Burned into nothing . She always wanted me to try writing things down . Maybe she was right , maybe it will help me to remember , to understand . Fletcher seems to think so . <p> Nothing makes any sense anymore . . . My wife is gone , my sons are without their mother . . . the things I saw that night , I remember hearing Mary scream , and I ran , but then . . . everything was calm , just for a second  --  Sammy was fine  --  and I was sure I had been hearing things  --  too many horror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the blood , and when I looked up , my wife . . . <p> Half our house is gone , even though the fire burned for only a few hours . Most of our clothes and photos are ruined , even our safe  --  the safe with Mary 's old diaries , the passbooks for the boys ' college accounts , what little jewelry we had . . . all gone . How could my house , my whole life , go up like that , so fast , so hot ? How could my wife just burn up and disappear ? <p> I want my wife back . Oh God , I want her back . <p> I thought at first that we would stay . Mike and Kate helped me take care of the boys at first , and Julie 's been great too , but I tried to tell them  --  tell Mike  --  what I think happened that night . He just looked at me , this look . . . like he 's sure I 'm crazy . He must have told Kate something too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I should think about seeing a shrink . How can I talk to a stranger about this ? I never saw a shrink for everything I went through in the Marines , and I got through that . My friends think I 'm going insane . Who knows , maybe I am . . . <p> The police quit on the case as soon as they could n't pin it on me . They do n't care that she was on the ceiling , they do n't care about the blood on her stomach or about any of the things I 've seen since then . They want a tidy answer . Does n't matter to them whether it 's the right one . The last time I talked to them , a week after she died , they asked me the same questions they asked me the night of the fire . Where was I ? How was my relationship with Mary in the weeks prior to the fire ? Any problems with the boys ? I can tell where they 're going . <p> Mary 's uncle Jacob had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . I did n't go . Why ? There was nothing to bury , and I do n't think I could have listened to what anyone there would have said . I 've been drinking too much , trailing off in the middle of sentences . I hear things at night while I sit in Sam and Dean 's room . Everything lately feels like those instances when you remember a dream a few days after you had it , but then you ca n't remember if it was a dream or if it actually happened . I keep going over that night in my head . . . why did I ever get out of bed ? I left my wife by herself to go watch TV , and she died . I 'm so sorry , Mary . <p> Dean still hardly talks . I try to make small talk , or ask him if he wants to throw the baseball around . Anything to make him feel like a normal kid again . He never budges from my side  --  or from his brother . Every morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arms wrapped around baby Sam . Like he 's trying to protect him from whatever is out there in the night . <p> Sammy cries a lot , wanting his mom . I do n't know how to stop it , and part of me does n't want to . It breaks my heart to think that soon he wo n't remember her at all . I ca n't let her memory die . <p> Woke up yesterday morning with a nasty hangover . . . Was n't in the mood to do much of anything , much less have a heart-to-heart with Mike , who jumped on me the second I walked into the kitchen . I guess that 's his right , since it was his house . He was going on about how I have to get myself together , for the boys . . . but he seemed more concerned about the garage than anything else . Accusing me of phoning it in , you 've barely been in to work . . . No kidding I 've barely been in to work . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , maybe my boys are at risk too . . . how can I forget about all that and go to work , for God 's sake ? <p> <br> Continues ...
