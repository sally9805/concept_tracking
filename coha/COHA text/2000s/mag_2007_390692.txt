The image is among the most iconic in civil-rights history : a dignified black girl in a prim , white-and-black dress marches through a hostile mob intent on keeping her from school . Fifty years after it first flashed around the world , that image retains its power-evoking sorrow , even anger , that one so young would face such cruelty . Now a 65-year-old woman , Elizabeth Eckford still bears scars from that long , lonely walk as one of the Little Rock Nine : teenagers charged with integrating that city 's finest high school in 1957 . " I 'm the only one who says I would n't do it again , " said Eckford in an interview at the Little Rock courthouse where she works as a probation officer . This month , Little Rock will commemorate the date , 50 years ago , when President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne to escort black children to Central High . In that moment , Little Rock became a synonym for hate . After claiming that desegregation would lead to violence , Gov . Orval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attending the school . Meanwhile , the black students designated to integrate Central High made plans to enter as a group . Eckford 's family had no phone , so she never got the message . She came alone , only to be sent away by Faubus 's soldiers and left to the angry mob . No black child got in on the appointed day . Three weeks later , armed with a judge 's order prohibiting Faubus from interfering , the students were spirited in through a side door ( the mob was so unruly , however , police decided the Nine could not stay ) . In the weeks that followed , they endured unrelenting abuse . They never believed the task would be easy , but they had no idea how hellish it would become . Minnijean Brown Trickey was expelled for a fight she did n't start . " If we knew what it was going to be , we would have been too scared to go , " says Trickey , who returned to Little Rock after many years away to care for an aged parent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress disorder . For years , she could not work . In her current job since 1999 , she has found a measure of peace : it has taken " a long time getting there , a long time to talk about the past without crying . " Mostly , the Nine have flourished . Many got advanced degrees . All moved away-for a while , at least-and Little Rock tried to move on . Mayor Mark Stodola says it 's time to put the past aside . He says Little Rock never deserved its racist reputation and that " the people who want to continue to look to the past are an impediment to where we want to go for the future . " Ralph Brodie , a Central High football player and student-body president at the time of the crisis , says the reputations of many were unfairly tarnished by the actions of a few . Most people at Central were receptive to the black enrollees , he says , yet the world focused on " problem students-25 maybe , a minuscule percentage . " The rest " did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says Brodie , a lawyer and member of Central 's 50th Anniversary Commission . The black students do not remember things that way . " The tone was set by a couple of hundred students engaged in this reign of terror , " says Ernest Green , one of the Nine and an executive with Lehman Brothers . " The silence was deafening . We would have appreciated some of them speaking out when all of this harassment was going on . " Eckford also dismisses Brodie 's point . Those who were silent , she says , are just unwilling to " think of themselves as bad people . " Today , like much of the rest of America , Little Rock grapples with a continuing achievement gap in its schools , economic distress in disproportionately minority neighborhoods and mistrust among competing communities and public officials . Earlier this year Central High student Brandon Love drew a straight line from the past to the present . In an article in the Arkansas Times and elsewhere , he observed that his Advanced Placement classes were overwhelmingly white : " As an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encountered A Tale of Two Centrals ... As the only African American in most of my classes , I experience firsthand what some dismiss as " subtle " racism , " he wrote . Nancy Rousseau , the transplanted New Yorker who is principal at Central , acknowledges that more whites than blacks take AP classes-but she blames differences in preparation and achievement , not discrimination . " That 's an issue that we 're dealing with , an issue that , unfortunately , is universal , " she says . " There are places that are overcoming it , and I want us to be one of them . " The Supreme Court agrees that focusing on past racial wrongs will not yield solutions for the future-as made clear in June by its ruling against voluntary school-desegregation plans . But there is still a point in remembering how we got here , and remembering how determined some people were to keep Americans apart- if only because it reminds us of why it remains so hard for us to come together . photo : LONG , LONELY WALK : Fifty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elizabeth Eckford ( above then , and left today ) marched into history FROM TOP : WILL COUNTS-ARKANSAS DEMOCRAT-GAZETTE-AP , PHOTOGRAPH BY CHARLES OMMANNEY-GETTY IMAGES FOR NEWSWEEK <p>
