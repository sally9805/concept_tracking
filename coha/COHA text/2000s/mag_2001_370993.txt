Is it safe to come out yet ? No one really knows , but most market gurus agree that the economy is probably near the bottom even if it is n't exactly there yet . Sure , the Federal Reserve 's seventh rate cut since January did little to inspire buying on Wall Street last week , but lower interest rates will eventually have a positive effect . Do n't be concerned about the timing of the turn . You should be more focused on having a strategy in place to take advantage of it . <P> Though the Fed voiced concern about sagging corporate profits and the slowdown in capital spending , there are some encouraging signals . The index of leading economic indicators was up for the fourth month in a row in July . The country is still essentially at full employment , and manufacturing ( excluding technology ) is showing signs of stabilizing . Given all that , strategists such as Steve Young of Banc of America Capital Management have confidence the economy is in the " bottoming-out process . " That bodes well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make strong double-digit or above-average returns for the next year . We could potentially have below-average returns , " says Young . For long-term investors , he thinks keeping 70% of your assets in stocks and the rest in bonds is the best approach for " balanced appreciation . " <P> After watching the markets ' slide , you may not have the stomach for picking stocks . So here 's a tip from Scudder Investments chief investment strategist Bob Froehlich : Beat everyone else to large multinational companies . Froehlich says that eventually individual investors are going to feel as though they 've been penalized for sitting on the sidelines in money-market accounts earning 3% . " When they feel penalized , then the first stop into the equity market is the large-cap multinational company , " he says . " You do n't come off the sidelines and go to some small biotech company whose name you do n't even know . " <P> Diversification is never out of fashion , so continue to seek out investments that are n't highly correlated to smooth out the inevitable bumps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stocks as well . <P> And do n't say bye-bye to bonds . As investors look forward to equities rebounding , some may be thinking about abandoning bonds . But Bill Gross , chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management Company , says it 's actually a good time to buy bonds backed by the Government National Mortgage Association , known as Ginnie Mae . They 're offering yields of 6% to 6.5% . The government guarantees principal and interest on Ginnie Maes , which gives them the highest credit quality . <P> The economy may be close to the bottom , but it 's still not the time to be taking a lot of chances . So stick with some fixed-income securities , keep a balanced mix of equities  --  and add a dose of patience . <P> Sharon Epperson is a correspondent with CNBC Business News .
