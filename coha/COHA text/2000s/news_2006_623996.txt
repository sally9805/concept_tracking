<p> At Woodside High in San Mateo County , college-prep classes awaited a 15-year-old boy with learning disabilities and anxiety . <p> He would blend in with other college-bound students , but also receive daily help from a special education expert . He would get a laptop computer , extra time for tests  --  and an advocate to smooth any ripples with teachers . If an anxiety attack came on , he could step out of class . <p> But Woodside High was n't what his parents had in mind . <p> Instead , they enrolled him in a $30,000-a-year prep school in Maine  --  then sent the bill to their local public school district . <p> Similar stories are playing out up and down California as more parents of special education students seek extra-special education at public expense : private day schools , boarding schools , summer camps , aqua therapy , horseback therapy , travel costs , personal aides and more . <p> Dissatisfied with  --  or unwilling to consider  --  classes and therapies offered by public schools , growing numbers of parents have learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threaten to sue . <p> And an expensive legal battle is the last thing district administrators want . So they often give in . <p> Legal proceedings " are a huge time drain on your administration and your teachers , " said Karen Mates , special education director for the Tampalpais Union High School District in Marin County . " You do n't want to spend precious dollars on this , so districts will settle a case to avoid it . " <p> The result : Expensive legal judgments and confidential settlements add hundreds of millions of dollars to already soaring special education costs across California , while taxpayers are kept in the dark about how the money is spent . <p> Meanwhile , California school districts shift more than a billion dollars a year out of their regular school budgets to pay for it all . <p> " This is not sustainable , " said Paul Goldfinger , a California school finance expert . " Special education is a growing portion of budgets in many districts , squeezing out services for other pupils . <p> Yet to many parents whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best . <p> In the Woodside case , the boy was still a year from finishing middle school when his parents hired a consultant to find them an alternative to Woodside High . <p> The consultant , Miriam Bodin , suggested several private schools , all outside of California . The parents chose Kents Hill , a bucolic boarding school with one-tenth the enrollment of Woodside High  --  and no special education program . <p> " I did n't care if they had special education , " said the boy 's mother , who agreed to discuss the case if the family were not identified . " He needed a small classroom on a small campus . This was a very good situation . " <p> He enrolled at Kents Hill in 2000 . <p> Records show the parents had previously gotten their elementary district , Portola Valley , to pay half the tuition of a small private middle school in Vermont for students with learning disabilities . <p> Now they hoped to get the Sequoia Union High School District , which includes Woodside High , to pay for Kents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an expert in special education cases . She filed papers in 2002 demanding that Sequoia Union pay four years of tuition and the family 's costs for travel between Maine and California . <p> And by the time the boy graduated from high school in 2004 , the Woodside case would stand as an icon of the troubled state of special education : parents and educators at odds , inequity in a system meant to equalize , and myriad rules so esoteric they 've spawned a new specialty field for lawyers .  --   --   --  <p> " Special ed , " as it 's widely known , is a hard-won civil right born in the 1970s and designed to correct years of discrimination by giving children with special needs an equal opportunity to learn . When it works as it should , special ed offers a lifeline to kids with a range of disabilities , from speech impairments to brain injuries . <p> Each child receives an " individualized education plan " specifying the type and amount of extra help they 'll get . A team of parents , teachers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ update the plan . <p> The bedrock of the federal law is a " free and appropriate public education " for anyone with disabilities , from birth to age 22 . <p> But the law does n't define " appropriate "  --  an omission that has led to escalating disputes about what public schools must pay for . <p> Special ed serves nearly 700,000 students in California , and the program appears to be working for most of them . Yet complaints are rising , and fast . <p> Last year , 3,763 children with disabilities were the subject of formal complaints over educational services , triple what it was a decade ago . Parents open the vast majority of cases , and districts have a built-in financial incentive to settle them because it can cost up to $40,000 to go to a hearing . And then there 's the possibility of an expensive judgment against the district . <p> So districts try not to let a case go that far . Last year , districts participated in 386 full hearings  --  just 10 percent of cases opened . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " They really do n't want parents out saying , ' Oh , if you just sue this district , you 'll get whatever I got , ' " said Elizabeth Estes , an attorney with Miller , Brown , &; Dannis , which represents districts . <p> It 's an equation that virtually ensures some children will receive benefits unavailable to those whose parents do not file complaints . <p> Examples include " dolphin therapy and horseback riding , " said Johnny Welton , a special ed coordinator for Contra Costa County . " Things that are beneficial to kids but are not an education-related service . " <p> Welton said such programs cost tens of thousands of dollars and lure parents in with the promise of outstanding results . When parents ask for them , educators are forced to do " risk management . " <p> " Why not pay for a few hours of horseback riding instead of spending $50,000 on attorneys at a hearing ? " he said . " In a practical sense , the schools have to pay it . "  --   --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expense has become a sought-after benefit for children with a wide range of disabilities . The practice of " unilateral placement "  --  enrolling a child in a private school , then billing a district for tuition  --  is gaining ground , say educators . <p> In California , private enrollment for students with disabilities has risen nearly five times faster than the overall increase in special ed students , state records show . <p> Since 1993 , the number of students in public special ed programs rose 27 percent , to 681,969 from 539,073 . But special ed students placed in private schools at public expense rose nearly five times faster  --  128 percent , to 15,926 from 6,994 . <p> As costs soar , many educators paint a picture of a system financially out of control and increasingly unfair to students whose families ca n't afford lawyers to win them extra-special education at public expense . <p> In Sonoma County , for example , a family recently enrolled its child in an out-of-state boarding school , then billed its district not only for tuition , but airfare , car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tailoring , new clothes , an iBook computer , stamps , tolls , gas and 13 future round-trip visits . Total tab : $67,949 . <p> The district paid " a portion , " said a school official who revealed the bill on condition of anonymity . <p> " Special education is a huge industry now , " said Joyce Willett , the Sequoia Union High School District 's special ed director . " I do n't think the average person realizes what 's going on . " <p> Mates , the special education director for the Tampalpais Union High School District , agreed . <p> " We 're looking at a huge crisis heading into our schools , " she said . " At a time when education dollars are scarce , my district alone spends hundreds of thousands of dollars each year to pay for private placements for the children of Marin families , where schools often become the enemy . I want to expand our special education programs , but I ca n't even bring that up . " <p> And as the demands on special education rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staggering . All California students , disabled or not , feel the impact of rising special ed costs . <p> In 2004 , for example , California schools received $4.1 billion from federal , state and local sources for special education . <p> It was n't enough . So districts took $1.6 billion more from regular class funds  --  double what they took a decade earlier  --  according to an analysis by School Services of California , a financial consulting firm . <p> In all , 28 percent of special ed expenditures in California came from regular education budgets in 2004 . <p> " It 's a blank check , " said Goldfinger , vice president of School Services . " The system is stacked so that one segment of the population  --  disabled children  --  has first call on funding , and the others get whatever 's left . "  --   --   --  <p> If there 's one thing parents , lawyers and educators agree on , it 's that special education law is about as complicated as it gets . <p> When President Gerald Ford signed special ed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the public would wind up paying for " administrative paperwork and not educational programs . " <p> " Holy cow , was he ever right , " said Jerry Gross , a retired superintendent in Orange County who helped draft the original law . Gross described the law 's myriad requirements as " 150 points of potential mistakes " for school districts . <p> Missing even one step can cause a district to lose its case if a hearing officer finds that a student 's education suffered as a result . <p> " There is n't an attorney who ca n't find us making a mistake on one of those things , " Gross said . <p> The Woodside case is a good example . <p> On July 1 , 2002 , the Woodside boy 's attorney filed the papers demanding that the Sequoia district pay for tuition at Kents Hill , family travel , extra classes and psychological testing for the boy , who had just completed his sophomore year at boarding school . <p> But district administrators balked at paying the boarding school bill ; 640 other students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the educators said their public program was good and met all legal standards . <p> " We have an excellent special education program , " said Woodside High Principal Linda Common . " We really help kids . " <p> Nevertheless , in hopes of keeping costs down , the district agreed to try and settle with the family . But talks went nowhere for two years . So in spring 2004 , the Woodside case went to a full hearing before state Hearing Officer Michael Arkin , who had to decide whether the Sequoia Union High School District offered the boy an " appropriate education " each school year . <p> A parade of witnesses took the stand over six days . A speech pathologist , a neuropsychologist , boarding school teachers , and the consultant Bodin all spoke for the student . <p> On the district 's side were teachers and special ed experts , all testifying to the quality of Woodside High 's program and the skill of its instructors . <p> In the end , Arkin ignored it all . <p> Instead , he looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every deadline . <p> It had not . <p> The boy 's attorney , Dobel , presented evidence that Sequoia had never prepared a required " transition plan " for the family . That is , district administrators had never filled out the proper form indicating precisely how teachers would ease the boy into bustling Woodside High , either from his private middle school or from Kents Hill . <p> That misstep meant Sequoia had failed to offer the student a legally appropriate education  --  and the family was justified in seeking a school somewhere else . <p> Not that the family ever requested a transition plan , Arkin noted  --  or even visited Woodside before choosing a private school . <p> " The question arises as to whether Student 's parents intended to enroll him at any district school under any circumstances , " Arkin wrote in his decision . <p> Based on that suspicion , Arkin ordered the school district to reimburse half the tuition , not all . <p> He also denied round-trip airfare , noting that the family had failed to show why their son had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as is possible in the continental United States . " <p> By the time Arkin reached his decision , the boy had already graduated and was about to enter college . <p> In all , the district spent $140,600  --  including legal bills that exceeded the district 's share of the Kents Hill tuition , which was $62,600 , said Ed La Vigne , who cuts the checks for Sequoia . <p> The district paid $50,000 for the family 's legal bill and $25,000 for its own . From the family 's perspective , the battle was justified . <p> " He was not offered the classes that I thought he needed , " the mother said . " If my son did n't get what he needed , my fear was that he would drop out of school . " <p> She acknowledged he had never been a discipline problem . The hearing records describe him as a " young adult who is likable , friendly , energetic and highly motivated . He is physically active , plays lacrosse and soccer , and enjoys wakeboarding and snowboarding . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " However , his frustration and anxiety were so high that I could see that this is the type of person who , out of frustration , turns to drugs or something that he should n't be doing . " <p> To Sequoia officials , the case exemplifies a system so out of control that a procedural misstep can result in one student attending an exclusive boarding school at public expense while others make do with the standard fare . <p> " This is an attack on public education , " La Vigne said . " Everybody wants the best for every kid . At what point do you say ' enough ' ? " <p>  --  Defining ' appropriate ' <p> Federal law says every person with a disability is owed an " appropriate " education , free of charge , from birth to age 22 . <p> It does n't have to be a " Cadillac " education , according to the U.S. Supreme Court . But it must provide a " basic floor of opportunity . " <p> California schools serve nearly 700,000 students with disabilities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ districts has risen steadily for 15 years . Last year , there were 3,763 requests for dispute resolution . <p> Most are settled secretly through mediation , where benefits won by families are never disclosed .

The full case histories can be found at http : **55;6458;TOOLONG . ( The case number and year are required . ) . <p> San Rafael Elementary District 2003 ( Case No. 400 ) <p> At issue : If a child makes some academic and behavioral progress at school but exhibits inappropriate and dangerous behavior at home , is the school responsible for addressing the out-of-school problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ residential tuition , cross-country transportation , food and lodging costs for six visits by parents and siblings , and interest on the school loan ? <p> What happened : A 10-year-old boy with Tourette 's syndrome , diagnosed as emotionally disturbed with aggressive and potentially dangerous behaviors , attended a Bay Area private school for students with similar problems . The district paid the tuition . Although the boy made overall progress at school , he was unable to apply what he learned outside of the classroom . At home , the boy 's behavior was " quite frightening , " testified Dr. Herbert Schreier , chief of psychiatry at Children 's Hospital of Oakland . In 2003 , his family enrolled the boy in an out-of-state boarding school and asked the district to pay . Current 12-month tuition : $98,185 . <p> What the parents said : Their son 's unique needs could be appropriately addressed only at a 24-hour residential school , such as Devereux in Connecticut , which specializes in helping students with similar disabilities . Because the child did not apply what he learned at private day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public school district should pay for more extensive support . In a letter dated Aug. 13 , 2002 , the mother wrote that although her son did not hit , bite or kick at school , at home such problems were " severe and have not let up at all . " <p> What district administrators said : The family 's placement of their son at Devereux was made for family reasons , not educational reasons . " It 's understandable that parents want the best for their children , but our society is not willing to provide a Cadillac education for every child - just an education , " said attorney Damara Moore of Ruiz &; Sperow in Emeryville , who represents the district . " In this situation , the student was violent at home , so they wanted him removed . And they wanted someone to pay for that . " <p> What the hearing officer ruled : The district was responsible for the student 's behavior outside of class and that a 24-hour residential school was appropriate . The district had to pay for the family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school , but not for other travel or interest payments . <p> Bottom line : The San Rafael Elementary District has so far paid $356,052 , including the family 's legal expenses . Elements of the case are being appealed in federal court . . <p> San Francisco Unified School District 2002 ( Case No. 192 ) <p> At issue : Should a kindergarten-age girl with an autism-like condition receive a personal aide , play therapy , psychological therapy and a private education at public expense , and should those services continue after the local public school district has developed a similar program that administrators say is tailored to meet her needs ? <p> What happened : District administrators told the child 's family to choose from among several schools with classes appropriate for their daughter , who had a central nervous system disorder causing autism-like symptoms , physical problems and difficulty relating to peers . After looking at a few schools , the family was told that some were full or were for preschool students only . The family then enrolled the child in private school and hired private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them a public program was available , but the family declined it unless an aide was also provided . The district eventually agreed to offer an aide for four months , then re-evaluate the need . The family declined . <p> What the parents said : The district made insufficient efforts to assess all the educational needs of their daughter , who was 7 during the hearing , and to provide her with appropriate services . The district should compensate for those errors by paying for private tuition and school supplies , as well as reimbursing the cost of a personal aide , play therapy , private testing and services in neuropsychology , occupational therapy , speech and language , psychological help , vision , physical therapy and transportation . <p> What the district said : A one-to-one personal aide was not necessary for the child to benefit from her education , and could even impede progress toward greater independence . An appropriate public program has always been available , although not necessarily at the family 's preferred school . Small-group speech , occupational and physical therapies were also educationally appropriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What the hearing officer ruled : The district made two significant errors : Educators were four months late in offering the child her individual education plan , and they should have directed her to attend a specific program at a specific school , instead of requiring the parents to participate in the district 's school-selection program . As a result of these mistakes , and because the personal aide and play therapy help the child , the district must pay her private tuition and reimburse the family for all other services requested , except the neuro8psychological and vision . <p> Bottom line : The district has so far paid $313,985 , including the family 's legal expenses . District administrators say they have since developed a program specifically designed for this child . The family has so far declined to enroll their daughter in the program , nor must they do so . Once the hearing officer rules that a private placement is appropriate , a district must continue to pay for it until a family chooses to make a change or until the district takes the family back to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ District in Huntington Beach ( Orange County ) 2001 ( Case No. 2087 ) <p> At issue : Is a 13-year-old boy with autism entitled to receive horseback riding and aquatic therapies at public expense , and should the school district or the parents decide in what setting to test the student ? <p> What happened : The boy 's parents and district officials agreed that he should attend a public middle school so that he could interact with nondisabled peers . But they could not agree on what his academic goals should be , where he should be tested , and whether specialty therapies were necessary for him to make educational progress . <p> What the parents said : Horseback and swimming pool therapies were essential to meet their son 's unique needs . His educational progress should be determined using the " ecological " method , in which tests are conducted in several settings - including a regular education classroom , home and community . Among those testifying for the student was Judith Heumann , who served as assistant secretary for the Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Horseback and swimming pool therapies were not necessary to meet the student 's educational needs . An appropriate program included speech and language services ; occupational therapy ; physical education adapted for students with special needs ; parent training ; transportation ; and a test of progress every three years , only some of which would be conducted in settings outside of the school 's therapy room . <p> What the hearing officer ruled : The district 's educational program and testing method were appropriate for the student , and horseback and aquatic therapies were not necessary . <p> Bottom line : The district paid $239,044 to defend its position . The expenditures included $93,150 for a 23-day hearing , $108,019 for a federal appeal ; $36,875 for " administrative costs " ; and $1,000 to hire substitutes for eight days while the boy 's teachers testified or prepared for hearing . <p> Sources : Special Education Hearing Office and San Rafael Elementary , San Francisco Unified and Ocean View Elementary school districts . <p> CHART ( 1 ) : <p> A growing class - special education While the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between 1993 and 2004 , the number of special education students grew by 27 percent , according to the California Special Education Management Information System .
