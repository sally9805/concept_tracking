AT HOME IN BALLYROAN , in the single-story cottage that stood beside the sea , in the bed she shared with her older sister , eight-year-old Greta Cahill woke before dawn to a sound that was not the ocean , was not the animals bawling into the wind , was not a slammed gate , a clanging cowbell , or the rain beating on the gable . The sound was different , it was a first , and to hear it better Greta pushed the layers of blankets away from her shoulders and sat up . <p> " You 're letting in the cold , " Johanna said into the dark without whispering , and tugged at the blankets Greta had pushed away . As they struggled , a faint whiff of salmon stopped Greta 's hands . She had forgotten that part of last night 's catch was lined up on a shallow tray and resting in the emptied top drawer of the dresser she and Johanna shared . Greta pictured the six flat bodies in a neat row-tails to the back , heads to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The smell was barely noticeable so far , but Greta knew that in a few more hours the delicate tang of the drying fish would be like an itch inside her nose that could not be scratched . The salt would pull the water from the salmon 's river-logged bodies , and it would be Johanna 's job to drain the brine with Greta looking on and their mother standing behind saying , " Are you watching , Greta ? Are you seeing how your sister does it ? " <p> " Christ , " Johanna said , and pressed her face to her pillow . Greta knew what her sister was thinking . Last night , late , after listening to the usual activity at the back door and then in the kitchen , and after following the tsk-tsk of their mother 's slippers as she scurried around the cottage to the other hiding places , Johanna had sat up in bed just as Lily opened their door and said she 'd not have any fish in her room , thank you very much . <p> Holding the tray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set the lantern on the floor , placed the tray in the drawer , and reached over to give Johanna a lug . Smart , fast , her hand fell from the dark space above their bed and caught Johanna square on the cheek . There were salmon in drawers all over the cottage and in the highest cabinet of the press in the hall . <p> Now Johanna flipped over to her back as Greta worked to identify the sound that had woken her . " There was blood left last time , " Johanna said . " She says they 're all cleaned , but- " <p> Greta put her hand over Johanna 's mouth and held a finger in the air . " Listen , " she said . Then Johanna heard it too . Greta could tell by the way her sister 's back went rigid and her head lifted from the pillow . <p> " What is it ? " Johanna asked . " A horse and cart , " she answered herself a second later , and jumped out of bed to go to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ violently on the stones and dips in the road , the wood of the cart splintering as it slammed against the iron hitch . For a half second here and there the world went silent , and Greta cringed in expectation of the airborne cart landing with a clatter . The racket grew louder as it came closer , rolling toward their cottage like thunder , like a stampede . The bedroom window did n't face the road , but Johanna stayed there , hopping from foot to foot on the wood planks of the floor as she peered through the gray-green light . Just as Greta was about to shout for their mother , they heard the crash , an explosion of wood coming to a sudden halt against stone and hard ground , followed by the everyday sound of a horse galloping away . <p> " Tom , " Greta heard Lily say on the other side of the wall . " Get up . " <p> Johanna opened the door of their bedroom and the cold of the hall swept into the room just as cruelly as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where you are , " Big Tom said when he emerged from his bedroom and saw Johanna . " Do n't make me say it twice . " He walked over to her , looked over her head to Greta , who was still in bed , and then to every corner of the room . " And keep that drawer well closed . " <p> " It 's something to do with the salmon , " Johanna said when he left , still hopping from foot to foot . Greta did n't understand about the salmon , so she did n't answer . She suspected that Johanna did n't understand either but liked to pretend that she did . <p> In another minute Lily came out , tying the belt of her long cardigan , and told Johanna to either get back under the covers or get dressed . " You too , " she said to Greta . She lit the paraffin lamp in the hall , twisting the knob to raise the wick and make the yellow flame higher . The boys-Jack , Little Tom , and Padraic-were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low hum of their voices traveling on the heavy air of dawn . As her much older brothers , they existed for Greta as a unit , all roughly the same age-twenty , nineteen , eighteen-all tall , black hair , black stubble on their cheeks by the end of each day . The only thing that kept them from being three identical spokes on the same wheel was Little Tom , who was born with his top lip attached to the bottom of his nose and something wrong with the inside of his mouth . <p> Greta squinted to find Johanna . " What 's happening ? Did Mammy go out too ? " She felt for the lump of wool stockings she 'd tied and left beside her bed the night before , and then for the navy cardigan that hung alongside Johanna 's at the back of the door . " Johanna ? " she said , turning around and stretching her neck toward the shadowed corners of the room . " Are you there ? " She felt a draft from the front door opening and closing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking in their frames . <p> " Well , look it- " Big Tom shouted from outside a moment later . His voice was big , full of tobacco , turf smoke , and crushed seashells whipped up by the wind . " Get inside , girl . Lily ! Get this child inside ! " Lily had just plunged her hands into the water pail in the kitchen when she heard him and rushed out of the house to catch Johanna , who 'd taken off in a run across the yard to the field , where a woman 's body lay in the grass . <p> " It 's the tinker from yesterday , " Johanna shouted as Lily hooked her around the waist and pulled her back toward the house . " Greta , remember your tinker from yesterday ? " Johanna kicked as she was pulled . She put both heels into the dirt and drew tracks . <p> Greta stood framed in the open cottage door , pulling the sleeves of her cardigan over her hands . It was the kind of day that would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She could feel the dampness on her skin , weighing down her clothes and making her shiver . She put her knuckle in her mouth and began to suck . <p> " Greta ? " Lily said . " Come in now , will you ? Like a good girl ? Like two good girls , you 'll both wait by the fire . " Lily blessed herself . " Lord to mercy on the poor woman . " <p> " It 's an awful day to be dead in a field , is n't it , Mammy ? " Johanna said , her breath ragged , the heat of her body coming through her sweater , cutting through the cold and the damp so that Greta could feel it as her sister brushed past , flicking her hair this way and that as she looked back and forth between her mother and the field , where Big Tom had gone down on one knee to lift the woman into his arms . <p> " I 'd say so , love , " Lily sighed . " Greta , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the very western edge of Ireland . Once , when the book man came to the Cahills ' door selling volumes on all subjects , he 'd taken Greta on his knee and told her to find her village on the map he unfolded and unfolded until it was the width of their kitchen table . When she could n't do that , he told her to find Connemara . When she could n't do that either , he used his finger to find Galway for her and covered the whole west of Ireland in the process . She was surprised to learn that at the end of all that ocean that began at the end of their lane was a piece of land a hundred times the size of Ireland , and that someone over there might be standing at the end of her own lane and looking back toward her . <p> At the start of the Second World War , the village of Ballyroan consisted of seven families , which came to just over fifty people spread over one square mile . Conch , the closest town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived on the bogland or in the fields that stretched between Conch and Ballyroan , leaving those seven families alone , except when the children went to school or the people from town rode their bicycles out to swim in the sea or for some other equally isolated purpose . Big Tom often said that living in Ballyroan was like living on an island , except better . In every direction was water , but unlike the islands that sat out in the ocean like the backs of whales , Ballyroan had a freshwater river running through it . Not a stream , mind you , but a river . Fast , deep , full to the brim with fish if you knew the right places to look . It was because of the river that the Cahills never had to leave . Not when the Normans came , not when Grainne O'Malley ruled the clans and the seas , not even during the potato blight when the people either fled or turned into shadows . <p> " Because of this , " Big Tom always said at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Put that away , you fool , " Lily said when she saw him at it . Sometimes she would grab it out of his hands , gather it up in her arms until it was as small as she could make it , and carry it out of the kitchen to a hiding place only she and Big Tom knew . <p> But by 1956 , despite centuries of gathering seaweed from the high sea ledges , drying it , giving it to the children to chew or keep for the flower beds , despite generation after generation of the same families driving cattle , footing turf , churning butter , bleeding the fall pig from the ceiling rafter of a dark back room before covering him with salt the size of hailstones and closing him up in his barrel , despite all the narrow headstones sticking out of the fields like milk teeth , five of the seven houses in Ballyroan were abandoned , their windows boarded , their inhabitants gone to England or Australia or Canada or America . Every one of these families said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once they had their legs under them , once they 'd put aside a little money to bring back home and start again , and when that day came , could they please write the Cahills to take the boards off the windows , light the fire in the kitchen , let the air and sunshine in . <p> Greta assumed that these families did not have a net like her father did , or they would n't have had to leave . According to the man on the wireless radio , all of Ireland was leaving for England and America , all except the very young and the very old . It seemed a simple thing , a net . Such an ordinary piece of daily life-like a bucket or a spade-and Greta could n't see why people would n't just go out and get one . <p> In the only other house left in Ballyroan lived Mr. Grady . Mr. Grady 's house stood exactly one mile north of the Cahills , and considered together the two houses were like signposts marking where one entered and exited Ballyroan . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grady , and when Greta asked why , Big Tom said it was because Mr. Grady was a miserable son of a bitch . Lily did n't like Mr. Grady spoken ill of in the Cahill house . She said it would bring bad luck . Sometimes she included Mr. Grady in the bedtime prayers she said with the girls , and when Big Tom said she should pray for the net and the salmon as long as she was praying for Mr. Grady , she said that would bring bad luck too . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
