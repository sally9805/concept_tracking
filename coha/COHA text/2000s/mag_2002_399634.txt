WHEN THE CHILL HITS HARD , LEAVE YOUR BIKE HOME AND STEP OUT FOR A FUN NEW WORKOUT THAT 'LL LEAVE YOU FASTER AND STRONGER THIS SPRING . by Stephen Madden // Nothing clears out the riffraff quite like winter . ( Except snowboarders . Nothing gets rid of snowboarders . ) Playing in the woods and mountains is easy when it 's sunny and warm , but you need gumption to head out when the air is freezing and the snow is flying . Enter snowshoeing . Thanks to the new generation of an outdoor standard , you can get an intense workout that will leave your legs strong , your lungs scorched and your heart more efficient than it was when you put the bike up on pegs for its winter nap . " Snowshoeing can help cyclists in three ways , " says Erik Skarvan , owner of Aspen , Coloradobased ' shoe and bicycle outfitter Sun Dog Athletics . " Going uphill really develops power and leg strength . Running on snowshoes on packed trails is great for speed . And just getting out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Leaving your bike on the hook when snow falls does n't make you less of a cyclist . Skarvan is a Colorado age-group-champion mountain biker and a member of Atlas Snowshoes ' factory racing team . Some of America 's best road racers were speed skaters ( Connie Carpenter , Eric Heiden ) , and Greg LeMond used cross-country skiing to build his aerobic base during his 1980s Tour de France victory binge . ( LeMond found that the intensive pole work of skate-skiing gave him the heavy upper body of a free safety , not the skinny physique of the king of the hill . ) Long popular with backwoodsmen as a way to operate in deep snow , snowshoeing has a new look and feel , thanks to space-age materials such as carbon fiber ( used in frames ) , titanium ( crampons ) and Hypalon ( decking ) . The result is that snowshoeing is now as easy as walking or running-there 's no need to waddle like you 're wearing a diaper . And because you do n't need poles , there 's no worry about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You can get a sick workout without , in the words of Canadian triathlon coach Rick Hellard , " the boredom of riding in a basement all winter . " One hour of snowshoeing at 3.5 mph on a flat , packed trail burns 740 calories . One hour at 2.9 mph in powder on a hilly trail burns an SUV-like 1,046 calories . To build cycling-specific leg strength ( quads , flexors ) , ' shoe racers spend a fair amount of snowshoe time going uphill . Powder workouts are Skarvan 's favorites because of the strength he builds lifting a ' shoe covered with snow-think pulling up on the pedal . " I have a routine I do with some guys called the Powder Studs workout , " he says . " We go out on a trail and warm up , then we head offtrail into powder that 's knee- to waist-deep . We do 30- , 60- or 90-second sprints , then recover on the trail . Five to a set , two or three sets-after that , man , you 're feeling it . " Experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start on riders who spent the winter indoors . " I do a 24-hour race in late April and always feel stronger thanks to snowshoeing , " says Patty Jo Struve , an Iditasport Extreme veteran who says her snowshoe workouts provide great interval training . " And my knees do n't get beat up . " But there 's another benefit to snowshoeing that devotees share only reluctantly with the unconverted . " I love the time spent out in nature , " says Struve , who 's known to spend five hours out on her ' shoes . " I 'm usually alone , because no one wants to spend that kind of time in the snow with me . It 's their loss . " And your gain . <p>
