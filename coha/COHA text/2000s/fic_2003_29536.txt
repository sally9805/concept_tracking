" I know , Anne . I know . " " I ca n't believe that this is happening . I ca n't believe that I 'm never going to see him again . " " I know , honey . I know . " It was just my mother and I , alone in the funeral parlor 's Room One , alone with Daddy . " He was the healthiest person , " I said . " He ate well , he exercised , how could he have had such a massive heart attack ? He was only sixty-two . " " I do n't know why these things happen , but they do . " My mother 's voice quivered and I reached my arms back around her . We held each other for a long moment and then we knelt in front of the casket to say a prayer . The blanket of pink and white carnations that covered the coffin read BELOVED HUSBAND AND FATHER . I looked at the shell of my father that was lying beneath the flowers and shut my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally we stood up and composed ourselves . I had just put a tissue back in my bag when someone came in the back door . " It 's Uncle John , " I said , bracing myself to meet the grief of my father 's only brother . The wake was jammed . My father had worked at Wellington Farm here inMidville for the last twenty years , and during that time he had personally broke every youngster that had come through that well-known thoroughbred breeding operation . Everyone in town knew him , from the lowliest stable boys to the millionaire farm owners . The room was at its most crowded when Liam finally arrived . I saw him over the heads of others as he stepped into the doorway and looked around . I stopped breathing . Across the room our eyes met . I had n't seen him in two years , but he looked as arrogant as ever . " It 's Liam , " I heard someone behind me say . He started across the room and people automatically made room for him as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was standing in front of me and holding out his hand . " Annie . What can I say to you ? I 'm so sorry about Pete . " He was the only person I had ever allowed to call me Annie . I put my hand in his and he bent and kissed my cheek . I recognized the smell of him . " Thank you , Liam , " I said . " It was quite a shock . " I took my hand away and at that moment my mother came up to us . " Liam . It 's good to see you . " He turned his cobalt blue eyes toward her and said how sorry he was . " Thank you , Liam . It 's going to be hard getting used to living on my own . " " Annie is staying with you , is n't she ? " I said , " I took a month 's leave from my job to help Mom get settled . " " How did you manage that ? " he asked . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend of Dr. Ritchie 's and she came north for the summer to work for us . Florida is dead in the summer . So , when I asked about taking an unpaid leave for a month , Dr. Ritchie agreed . The visiting vet can take my spot . " A faint line appeared between his black brows . " I always thought that when you graduated you would come back here to practice . " Just what I need , I thought . A chance to see Liam all the time . " This job in Maryland was a great opportunity , " I said . " I was lucky to get it . " His frown did n't lift , and he turned to Mom . " Please let me know if there 's anything I can do for you , Nancy . And do n't worry about having to get out of the house . It 's yours for as long as you care to stay . " Mom gave him a grateful smile . " Thank you , Liam , but you 'll need the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stay in a couple of weeks . I 'm thinking of moving into town . " " Do n't rush things , " he advised . " I wo n't . I just ... well , I think it might be easier for me to be in a new place , a place that does n't have so many memories . " He put his arm around my mother and gave her a brief hug . " Okay . " Mom said , " Thank you for the flowers . They 're magnificent . " Wellington Farm had sent a stand of flowers that took up a tenth of the room . " I 'll miss him too , " Liam said . " Not like you , I know , but I 'll miss him . " " I know you will , " Mom said softly . Liam glanced over his shoulder . " There are people waiting to talk to you . Please remember , if you need anything at all , give me a call . " " I 'll remember , " my mother said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teachers when a frisson of tension ran across the crowded room . I looked at the door and saw Andy Bartholomew come in . Involuntarily , I glanced toward Liam and so did everybody else in the room . Liam totally ignored the man who was advancing into the room . Andy did n't look at anyone either as he crossed the carpet to us . He took Mom 's hand in his and said how sorry he was . Then he took my hand as well . It was a measure of the respect in which Daddy was held that Andy Bartholomew would come into a room where he must have known he would find Liam . He did n't stay and he only looked at Liam once . The bleakness on his face was chilling . Liam did not look back . Toward the end of the evening I was standing alone when Senator Wellington came up to me . " How 's the job going , Anne ? Was it worth all those years in vet school ? You could have become an M.D. more easily , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the face of Liam 's father . Laurence Wellington was almost as tall as Liam , but where Liam was black-haired , his father 's hair was grayish-blond . He was serving his second term in Washington as Virginia 's U.S. Senator and had all the easy charm of the southern aristocrat . I had n't seen any sign of his wife , so I supposed she was getting cured again at the Betty Ford Clinic . " I like it a lot , " I said . " It 's what I always wanted to do . " " One of these days you 'll have to come and work here in Midville . " Instead of responding to him , I said , " I hear Wellington 's got a Derby horse this year . " " Someday Soon certainly won the Florida Derby in convincing fashion . But you know Liam ? he does n't want to jinx the colt by talking about him too much . " The senator sounded a little impatient . They had never gotten along very well . " It will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " It would do the breeding industry in Virginia a world of good to have a Virginia-bred win the Derby . And it would be great for the farm . " " That it would be . " A voice said , " Senator , I 'd like to talk to you when you get a chance . " I said , " Go ahead , Senator , I 'm going to check on my mother . " I went to stand at Mom 's side and the senator gave his attention to Herbie Lowther , who probably wanted to talk to him about farming subsidies or something like that . The following morning , Daddy 's funeral was even more crowded than his wake had been . Senator Wellington had insisted on having the post-funeral luncheon , so after we left the cemetery we all met at Wellington . Wellington , or the big house as we Fosters had always called it , stood imposingly behind a stone wall and a sweeping , park-like lawn dotted with large old trees . Long side wings and tall white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . Personally , I had always thought it was the prettiest house in the world . I had n't been inside Wellington since I had left Midville for boarding school ten years ago , but the front hall looked exactly the same : spacious and wide and furnished with a glass-fronted bookcase , a marble-topped table containing a vase of fresh flowers and two Sheraton chairs . The food was laid out in the dining room , another lofty , spacious room with an eighteenth-century fourpedestal Hepplewhite dining table and a sideboard , which was loaded with antique silver . Porcelain jars that had once belonged to Marie Antoinette adorned the mantel . I looked into the modern kitchen to thank Mary , the Wellington cook and housekeeper who had orchestrated the lavish spread of food . I took a plate but I could n't eat . I did n't feel like socializing , but then I did n't want to be left alone to think , either . I felt a hand close over my elbow . " Come along , " Liam said . " We 'll go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the huge front porch , the way I had followed after him for most of my early life . We set our plates on a table and sat down in two of the wicker chairs . He said , " I thought that Nancy might want to move to Maryland to be near you . " I shook my head . " She says she wants to stay in Midville . This is where her job and all her friends are . I think she 's right . If she moved to Maryland she would n't know anybody , and I work long hours . " " Well , if she wo n't move to Maryland , I think you should move back to Virginia . It is n't good for her to be alone . " " Liam , Mom is a grown-up person . She has tons of friends and she 's perfectly capable of living by herself . And besides Maryland is not that far away . I can easily come down here for weekends to visit , or she can come up to see me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not moving home . " He sighed . " I 've missed you , Annie . I 've missed my little sister . I guess I 'm not just asking for Nancy , I 'm asking for me too . " I felt pain slice through me . If only he had n't used the words " little sister , " how happy I would be . I said flatly , " Well , it is n't going to happen . " He scowled . " I never thought you 'd turn into such a hard-hearted witch . " My mouth dropped open . " I ca n't believe you just said that ! Here I am , at my father 's funeral , and you call me a hard-hearted witch ? " Color stained his cheeks and his blue eyes glittered . " Christ , Annie , I 'm sorry . I do n't know what came over me . " He inhaled deeply . " It 's just ? I 'm really upset at losing Pete this way . He was more of a father to me than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you . I 'm sorry . " Impulsively , I reached across the table and put my hand on his . The jolt of electricity was so powerful that my heart jumped . How could he not have felt it too ? I looked at him . He looked a little startled , that was all . I snatched my hand away . " It 's okay , " I managed to get out . " I forgive you . " He smiled at me . Whenever Liam smiled all my insides turned to goo . He stood up . " We should go back inside . People will be looking for you . " At that moment Frank Michaelson , the owner of Pine Tree farm , came out . Next to Liam 's splendid six foot three , he looked tiny . " There you are , Anne . I have to leave , but I wanted you to know that if there 's anything I can do for your mother , please let me know . " " Thank you , Mr. Michaelson . " I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got yourself a Derby horse , " he said to Liam . " Oh God , Frank , you know how it is . A horse 's route to the Derby is so treacherous that I 'm afraid to even think about it , " Liam replied . " Ford 's a good trainer . You have him in good hands . " " I know . " " All right . I 'll stop talking about it . But I wish you luck . " " Thanks , " Liam said . As Frank went down the porch steps I said to Liam , " I 'd better be getting back inside . " " All right . " As we passed through the door into the house , Liam put a brotherly hand on my shoulder and gave it a gentle squeeze . " Chin up , brat . " All I could manage in reply was a nod .
