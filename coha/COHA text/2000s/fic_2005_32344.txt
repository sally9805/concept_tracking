Chapter One But something was missing , and by three that afternoon Dayne knew what it was . The innocence . Dayne leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms as the last of the six read through her lines . A person could n't fake innocence-not even with an Academy Award performance . Innocence was something that grew in the heart and shone through the eyes . And it was the innocence that was lacking with each of them . Mitch Henry , casting director , was pacing near the back of the room . He finished with the final actress and bid her goodbye . On her way out she looked at Dayne and gave him a teasing smile . " See ya . " She was one of the ones he 'd dated . Actually , he 'd lived with her off and on for a month or so . Long enough that their pictures made the tabs a couple of times . Her eyes locked onto his . " Call me . " " Yeah . " Dayne pretended to tip an invisible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . He turned to Mitch . " Who 's next ? " " Who 's next ? " Deep lines appeared between Mitch 's eyes , his tone frustrated . " Do you know how hard it was to get six A-list actresses in here on the same day ? The part does n't even require the kind of talent we had in here , Dayne . Any one of them would knock it out of the park . " " They 're good . They 're all good . " Dayne uncrossed his arms and tapped his fingers on the table . " But something 's missing . " He paused . " I 'm not seeing innocent , Henry . Sophisticated , flirty , take me to bed , yes . But not innocent . " " Fine . " Mitch tossed his clipboard on the table and yelled at a passing intern to shut the door . On the table were the files belonging to the six actresses , and when the door was shut , Mitch took a few steps closer . " We 're on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edge of the table and leaned in . " Hollywood is n't exactly a stable of innocence . " " Okay . " Dayne pushed his chair back , stood , and walked to the window , his back to Mitch . He stared out through the hazy blue , and a face came to mind . A face he had n't forgotten in nearly a year . He held the image , mesmerized by it , and an idea started to form . It was possible , was n't it ? She worked in theater . She must 've dreamed of the silver screen somewhere along the way , right ? Dayne felt Mitch 's eyes on him , and he turned around . " I have an idea . " " An idea ? " Mitch scratched the back of his head and strode to the door and back . " We do n't need an idea ; we need an actress . Filming starts in four months . This film is too big to wait until the last minute . " " I know . " The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl would n't want a chance like this ? Dayne sucked in a slow breath . He could n't get ahead of himself . " Listen , Mitch , give me a week . I have someone in mind , but she 's out of state . " He leaned against the windowsill . " I think I can have her here in a week , by next Monday . " Mitch folded his arms , his expression hard . " Some girl you met at a club , Matthews ? Someone you made drunken promises to ? Is that what you want me to wait for ? " " No . " Dayne held up his hand . " She 's the real deal . Give me a chance . " A moment passed when Dayne was n't sure which way the casting director was leaning . Then Mitch swept up the six files and the clipboard and shot him a look . " One week . " He was halfway out the door when he turned once more and met Dayne 's eyes . " She better be good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the window again . What had he just done ? Buying a week meant putting the other talent on hold . It meant playing with a budget of tens of millions of dollars so he could find a girl he 'd seen just once and ask her to read for a starring role opposite him in a major motion picture . All when she might not have the interest or ability to act at all . The idea was crazy , except for one thing . In the past year the only time he 'd seen genuine innocence was when he 'd watched this same girl light up the stage at a small theater in Bloomington , Indiana , directing the chaos of a couple dozen kids in costumes at the close of what was apparently the theater troupe 's first show . He remembered most of what he 'd seen that day , but still the details were sketchy . The location of the theater was easy , something he could definitely find again . But he had almost no information on the girl except her name . Dayne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass . He could fly out and try to find her , but that would bring the paparazzi out of the woodwork for sure , make them crazy with questions about why Dayne Matthews was in Bloomington , Indiana . Again . He turned and grabbed his keys and cell phone . There had to be a way to reach her , to ask her out to Hollywood for an audition without the story making every tabloid in town . Dayne shoved the phone in his pocket and headed down the hall toward the elevator . A coffee , that 's what he needed . A double-shot espresso . Most of his friends in the industry had found offbeat coffee shops , places where they were less recognized . Not Dayne . He was a Starbucks man ; nothing else would do . If the paparazzi wanted to take his picture coming and going with his double espresso-and they almost always did-that was fine with him . Maybe he 'd get an endorsement deal and he could stand out front and pose for them . Dayne chuckled . That would send @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He opened the back door of the office building and felt a blast of warmth as the sunshine hit his face . The weather was perfect , not the usual June fog . He crossed the studio 's private parking lot to his black Escalade near the bushes and high privacy fence . Usually the studio back lots were free of the press hounds . Sometimes a lone photographer would climb the trees or sit on adjacent hillsides with high-power cameras trained on the office door . But only when a big deal was coming together or someone was in need of rehab-something like that . Today things looked calm . This time of the day there would n't be too many camera hounds on the hunt . Besides , his SUV was new . Only a few of them would know it was him behind the tinted windows . He pulled out of the studio lot and turned left on La Cienaga Boulevard . Two blocks down he looked in his rearview mirror and saw a familiar Volkswagen . Paparazzi . Even now , even with his new vehicle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into my mind . Once in a while he liked to lead them on . He glanced in his rearview mirror again and shrugged . He could use a little amusement . He turned into the Starbucks strip mall , but instead of stopping in front of the coffee shop , he parked near the Rite Aid , three doors down . He grabbed his baseball cap , slipped it low over his brow , and headed inside . There was n't another person in the store . Dayne dashed to the magazine rack and found the current editions of each of the four national gossip rags-the colorful , busy magazines that reported all manner of information regarding celebrities . Bloodsuckers , he and his friends called them . The old , white-haired man at the register did n't recognize him . " That 'll be nine fifty-eight . " The guy hummed " Moon River " as he slipped the stack of magazines into a bag and handed it to Dayne . " Nice day , huh ? " " Yeah , beautiful . " Dayne gave the man a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " God 's smiling on the Dodgers . " The man winked . " Five wins in a row , I tell you . This is the year . " " Could be . " Dayne grinned . He relished the moment . A sales clerk-probably a retiree-making casual conversation with him . Moments like this were sometimes all the normalcy he had anymore . " See you later . " " Yep . " The man shook his fist . " Go Dodgers . " Dayne walked outside , scanned the parking lot , and found the Volkswagen and the camera aimed straight at him . Then , with broad , dramatic gestures , he jerked one of the magazines from the bag and appeared to stare , shocked , at the cover . He covered his mouth and pretended to be absorbed in some scandalous story . After a minute he saw a group of teenage girls headed his way . They had n't recognized him yet , but they would . He slipped the magazine back in the bag , saluted the photographer , and slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Enough of the cameraman . He hit the Lock button on his key chain , made sure his windows were rolled up tight , then pulled into the Starbucks drive-thru lane . By the time he hit Pacific Coast Highway the double espresso was gone , and he 'd forgotten about the photographer or whether the guy was still behind him . The girl from Bloomington . That 's all he could think about now . How was he going to find her without flying to Indiana ? And how crazy was he to tell Mitch he could get her into the studio for a reading in a single week ? Dayne passed the usual landmarks-the Malibu Surfer Motel and the Whole Foods Market . His home was just past that , sandwiched between others belonging to people in the entertainment industry . A director and his singer wife on one side and an aging actress and her much younger husband on the other . Nice people . All drawn to the ocean , the watery view of endless calm and serenity . The picture of everything their lives lacked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another cup of coffee . Black , no sugar . Then he slipped on a pair of sunglasses and went outside onto his second-story deck . No photographer could see him up here , not with the steep walls built around the deck 's edges . He sat down , just barely able to see over the edge out to the Pacific Ocean . One at a time he took out the magazines . Of the four , his face or name was on the cover of two . Dayne studied the first one : " Dayne Matthews : Hollywood 's Most Eligible Bachelor Hits the Party Scene . " " I did ? " he muttered and turned to the article . There were many more photos on the two-page spread , each one showing him with a different woman . One he was kissing . One was a waitress and no matter what the photo showed , he was n't making moves on her . The bar had been loud , so he 'd moved in a little closer when he ordered . Beneath that photo the caption read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dayne frowned . What would the waitress think ? She was only doing her job , and now she had her picture splashed all over grocery checkouts throughout the country . He flipped through the pages . There had to be other pictures of him ; there always were . A few pages in he saw a short article in the section titled " Police Blotter . " The small heading read " Is Dayne Matthews Being Stalked by a Woman ? Police Find More Clues . " Dayne rolled his eyes . Often there was a nugget of truth to the articles in the gossip magazines . Police had notified him three times in the past month about a stalker , someone who was mailing strange letters to the police department threatening violence against Dayne Matthews . So far Dayne had n't seen any sign of a stalker . The matter was n't something he thought about for more than a few minutes when he was talking to the police . But leave it to the rags to have the latest scoop . He read the article , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another letter from the person writing threatening letters about Hollywood heartthrob Dayne Matthews . This time handwriting specialists say the letter is from a woman . One source close to the story said he was fairly certain the person writing the letters was a deranged fan , someone intent on harming Matthews . " She could be a phony , someone looking for attention , but still , " the source said , " we ca n't be too careful . " Exact details of the letters were not available , but a source told our reporter that the person writing the letters is demanding a day with Dayne Matthews or his death . Police will keep us posted on the story . Dayne blinked and a chill ran down his arms-more because of the breeze off the Pacific than any fear the article might 've stirred up . A day with him or his death ? Were people really that crazy ? He scanned the story again and dismissed it . Anytime information came from the ever-popular and oft-quoted " source , " Dayne and his friends knew to ignore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He turned the page , looking for additional stories . This was his ritual , his way of staying in touch with the audience and its view of him . Whether the stories were true or not did n't matter . If they were in print , he wanted to know about them . He kept flipping . Near the front was a section titled " Regular People . " Sure enough . There he was coming out of Starbucks with his double espresso . The caption read " Dayne Matthews loads up at his favorite haunt . " Ten pages later was a photo of him and J-Tee Ramiro , a hot Cuban singer he 'd dated a month ago . Okay , maybe they never went on an actual date . But they spent the better part of a week together , and the paparazzi had n't missed a moment . The shot was of the two of them sharing a salad at a small caf near Zuma Beach . The point of the story was that J-Tee was seeing someone new and that she had better rebound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dayne thumbed through the rest of the magazine . For the most part the thing was made up of pictures . It was why the photographers followed him , why they followed anyone with celebrity status . Whatever the rags paid the paparazzi , it was enough to keep them coming back for more . And some of the pictures were ridiculous . A section near the middle of the magazine showed half a dozen actresses and the undersides of their arms . " Who 's Flabby and Who 's Not ? " the banner headline shouted . The photos were close-ups of actresses caught pointing or raising their arms in a way that showed less-than-perfect triceps muscles . Dayne rolled his eyes and turned the page . In the past few years the rags had gotten even uglier . One of his friends-an A-list actress named Kelly Parker-was definitely feeling the effects of the pressure . She used to go out dancing or shopping with friends . Now she rarely left her house , and the last time he talked to her the spark was missing from her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom of one of the layouts caught his eye . A breeze off the ocean rustled the pages as Dayne squinted . It was a small article with two photos - one of Marc David , Dayne 's friend and fellow actor , and the other of a bedraggled man behind bars . Beneath the photos it said " Hollywood 's People sent a reporter to investigate Marc David 's recent trip to Leavenworth and guess what we found ? ? ? " Dayne inched himself up in his chair . His heart raced , and he felt blood rush to his face . What was this ? Marc was his friend , but the guy had never mentioned anything about Leavenworth . Dayne kept reading .
