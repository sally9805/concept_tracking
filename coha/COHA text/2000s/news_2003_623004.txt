<p> Hollywood 's newest writer goes to get another beer , but he does n't bother turning on a light , even though the sun went down an hour ago . <p> Floyd Salas has an offbeat way of telling a story , and this is one of his better ones . <p> It 's an autobiographical tale about a 72-year-old Berkeley writer who has published hundreds of poems and several books . With no screenwriting experience , he ends up in the middle of Aaron Spelling Productions in Los Angeles after signing a contract to write for the NBC series " Kingpin . " <p> " I did n't know where it was , how to get there or even how to get in the building . After I got in , I did n't even know what they were talking about , " Salas says . " I was like a country bumpkin out of the 1900s going to the city for the first time . " <p> In an industry known for demanding conformity , shunning old writers and giving little notice to artists north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartel drama is tantamount to finding a $20 million Lotto ticket on the ground . <p> " It 's a bit out of the ordinary , " says David Mills , the creator of " Kingpin , " which finishes up its six-episode run Tuesday . " He was another novelist and an older guy who the rest of the television industry would n't give a damn about . . . . I thought he would just bring a lot of life experience and literary value to my writing staff , and he did . " <p> Spend a few hours with Salas , and it becomes clear he could bring literary value to a trade show for dental instruments . <p> He answers the door of his modest Berkeley fourplex wearing black boots , black pants , black turtleneck and a flowing paisley bathrobe . Short in stature , long in white hair and still looking ready to mix it up at his fighting weight of 125 pounds , comparisons to Jedi master Yoda are inevitable  --  especially after Salas starts speaking in a patois of abstract wisdom that lingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A blacklipped bird/ hunting from a wind/snatched the yellow stalk of my tongue/ from the belly of a rain cloud/ and spit it on the peak/ of a climbing mountain , " his poem " Blacklipped Bird " begins , in a cadence that is n't far off from his conversation . <p> Growing up , Salas got in more fights than he can count  --  claiming to have won them all . After being arrested several times as a teen , he fell in love with books in 1948 while working as a library page in downtown Oakland . Since then , he 's taught English at several local colleges , coached boxing , volunteered to teach at prisons and written constantly . One of his books , " Tattoo the Wicked Cross " ( 1982 ) , was on The Chronicle 's list of the 100 best books on the 20th century from the Western United States . <p> Salas insists on explaining his trip to Hollywood chronologically , beginning in the 1970s . The story starts to take shape about 20 minutes in , as Salas talks about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mills was working for " NYPD Blue . " <p> " We met him ( at a writers conference ) and he was such as pleasant personality , " Salas says . " We hung out for a while . " <p> Mills describes hanging out with Floyd Salas as a wholly unique experience . Even though they did n't corresponded after the meeting , the elder writer stuck in the Hollywood up-and-comer 's mind . <p> " The visual presentation he made to those writers who attended  --  I just never forgot it . He was shadowboxing , moving around , he was doing it all , " Mills explains . " He speaks in such a distinctive staccato stream of conscious , it 's compelling . Then you listen to what he 's saying and realize what a life he 's lived . " <p> The two best qualities for television writers are brevity and a willingness to take instructions . <p> Salas recently was asked by a publisher to submit 70 pages for a book of poems . He handed over 1,250 pages . Informed that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But Mills looked beyond Salas ' rough edges , focusing on his experience writing about drugs and death  --  two continual themes in " Kingpin . " One of Salas ' brothers committed suicide at 29 , another nursed a 25-year heroin addiction . <p> Mills also remembered that " NYPD Blue " creators once recruited been-around-the-block author Leonard Gardner , who wrote the 1969 novel " Fat City . " The result was outstanding television . <p> " In my mind , Floyd Salas was my Leonard Gardner , " Mills said . <p> Salas , his girlfriend and writing partner , Claire Ortalda , and their dog , Rock , settled into a cramped Los Angeles studio , bought several books on screenwriting and studied for several hours a day . <p> " People ask me , ' What celebrities did you see ? What famous spots ? ' " Salas said . " I told them I was n't a tourist . I did n't go visit Marilyn Monroe 's grave . " <p> Mills said Salas ' tendency to go off on a tangent about drug use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inevitable shadowboxing-infused body language  --  brought a reality to the room . <p> " Everybody else in the room had written on a television show before and sort of was in the midst of building a television career , they kind of acted like TV writers act , " Mills said . " Floyd just acts like Floyd . He 's going to say what 's on his mind and add a different energy to it . " <p> While writers rarely get their scripts published word for word working for Mills , Salas has a " Teleplay by Floyd Salas " writing credit for Sunday night 's Episode 5 . He also inspired a very memorable scene in a previous installment . <p> " Somewhere in the midst of our discussions of life and everything else , Floyd said something that just struck me as brilliant when he said , ' I do n't believe in ghosts , but I saw one , ' " Mills said . " And he told us all these stories where he saw all these ghosts . I just had to use it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relayed a dream about the ghost of his cat that got run over . The resulting monologue is spoken by loose-cannon " Kingpin " brother Chato as he 's picking out guns in an arms warehouse . <p> Salas ' friends were split on whether Hollywood and the writer would be a good match but were n't shocked when he was successful . <p> Gerald Haslam , author of " Straight White Male , " said his friend always wrote with a good sense of dialogue and character . <p> " He 's the jock who 's an intellectual , too , " Haslam said . " He brings a lot of realism to his work that a lot of people would like to have but do n't . " <p> His I'll-talk , you-listen style was just what Michael Croft needed when he was an aspiring writer in the early 1970s . Croft , director of the Truckee Meadows Community College writers conference where Salas and Mills met , said he would drive from the mountains to Berkeley just to get help from Salas . <p> .3 " One time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I had car trouble and . . . I was really frustrated . And Floyd said ' hold tight . ' And the next thing I knew he was standing in my kitchen . He said ' I talk , you write down everything I say . ' He talked for about three hours . " <p> " Kingpin " drew a lot of viewers on its first night in the beginning of February but has fallen into the middle of the TV ratings pack . NBC has n't said if the series will be back . <p> Salas ' story has a happy ending , though . The money from " Kingpin " was enough to pay off the mortgage on four small apartments he bought decades ago . <p> He now calls the " Kingpin " job one of his three best ever , along with the Oakland Public Library employment and a stint in the late 1970s teaching creative writing at UC Berkeley . <p> It was especially nice because he was all but convinced it could never happen . Even when Mills first called to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I said , ' We 'll see , you know , ' " Salas says . " In Hollywood , sometimes things do n't happen .
