Introduction // it has become almost a matter of convention to talk about September 11 , 2001 , in terms of where one was when one first heard the news . I think it is part of an understandable quest to discover that precise point in time , that bridging nanosecond , between life before and life after . We are trying to recall the feel of things as we knew them and to discover just what changed  --  and how  --  in that instant when we became aware that this day would be different from all the days that had preceded it . For the record , then , I had just stepped out of the shower when I heard a bulletin come over the radio : Smoke was coming from the World Trade Center , and there were reports that a plane had hit one of the towers . // For me , though  --  and I suspect this is also true for others  --  the true force of September 11 was revealed not in a single moment but in a series of moments . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ correspondent phoned in after having been nearly overcome by the choking cloud of smoke and dust . After the second tower fell , another reporter , a woman new to the city , told of having her life saved by a member of the New York City Fire Department . With debris raining down and roiling in all directions , this firefighter pressed her against a wall . She could feel his heart beating against her back . She had been sure , she said , that this was how she would die . And later in the day , there were the pictures of doctors assembled outside St. Vincent 's Medical Center , waiting to perform triage on thousands of wounded who never arrived . // These moments marched alongside the indelible images of that day , each further advancing an understanding of the attacks ' toll . Each giving added confirmation to New York City mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani 's statement that we were looking at a " tremendous " loss of life  --  " More , " as he put it , " than we can bear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Nathaniel Hawthorne wrote : " Time flies over us , but leaves its shadows behind . " For now and for the foreseeable future , we stand in the shadows of that terrible , clear morning . We live in a world remade by the attacks of September 11 . Years will pass , and the photos and videos will age and fade . Our memories of the feelings attached to them in real time will also dim , as they have already . But echoes will continue to reverberate from that date . // For more than forty years , reporting for CBS News has given me a front-row seat on history . When big events occur , they always loom large in the present . And there are times when the television screen enlarges what the perspective of years will show to be stories of only passing importance . The inherent drama of the special report  --  the break-in during regular programming  --  and the modern broadcasting phenomenon of " blanket coverage " have a way of giving apparent equal weight to the many different calamities that set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to judge solely on the basis of television news hours , one might come away with the impression that the death of John F. Kennedy , Jr. , was as important a news story as the assassination of John F. Kennedy , Sr. It is n't a question of ranking tragedies but of gauging the historical impact  --  the far-ranging repercussions  --  of a story . And it is rare , in the fury of the moment , that these historical implications are reckoned with accuracy . // September 11 was one of those rare times . When the event happened , while it happened , we knew we were watching history unfold . We saw a line  --  a shadow  --  fall over the newsreel of our lives , one that would forever mark the days after as separate from the days before . We understood that we would remember , would someday tell our grandchildren , where we had been and what we had been doing when we heard the news . The TV screen did not enlarge that day , not when New Yorkers could see the twin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our nation 's capital could see a cloud of smoke billowing from the Pentagon . If anything , television reduced the horrible images to a size that could be comprehended . // Of course , the historical impact of any event depends on the reactions that follow in its wake . The attacks of September 11 have provoked not only a direct response  --  or series of responses  --  but also a larger and more profound change in how our nation interacts with the rest of our world . From the Middle East to South America , from the Persian Gulf to Central Asia and the Pacific Rim , the war on terrorism now provides the impetus and the context for American foreign policy . Indeed , an atmosphere of change prevails all around the world . Alliances are shifting . In the danger zones of the globe , there is a sense that once static situations are again " in play . " Some historians have compared the current state of affairs to that just before the outbreak of World War I , when great powers sought political advantage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World War II , the period of rising tensions that gave birth to the cold war . Whatever the point of comparison , the message is clear : As with those eras , our time is witness to a tectonic shift in international relations . // Such are the aftershocks that have continued and will continue to follow the earthquake that was September 11 . This book and DVD represent an effort by CBS News to chronicle the early hours , days , and weeks of this seismic jolt . They are intended as historical documents and reminders  --  reminders not only of the fact that terror struck on a beautiful fall day but of the pictures , sounds , and emotions that accompanied the attacks and our first efforts to deal with them , as a nation united in fear , anger , grief , and determination . // Much has been written and said about the effect of September 11 on America : that it awakened us from our illusions of invulnerability , that it shattered the sense of insularity that complacency and prosperity had let creep into our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truth in them . And like so many Americans of all professions , September 11 forced those of us who report the news to reevaluate what we do and how we do it stories that have flowed from it  --  has given us an opportunity to do the kind of journalism to which we aspire . It is a chance to perform a public service , to report news that is not only gripping but that also matters . From what I 've seen in the year between then and now , it is a chance that has been seized upon by much if not most of America 's working press . The focus , for now , is on the truly important . International coverage is up . It is not yet at the levels where it should be , and it may prove to be a temporary development , but for the moment the news reflects and informs America 's renewed outward gaze . // However painfully , we have received an education . But it has not only been an education of the mind . Our hearts have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage of the firefighters and police who answered the call at the World Trade Center and the Pentagon , by the ordinary citizens who gave their lives to deter United Airlines Flight 93 from its murderous path , by the fighting men and women who travel far and give so much to defend our country . The exhaustive labors of emergency workers and volunteers at Ground Zero have taught us new lessons in loyalty and love . Each flag-draped stretcher and coffin , every moment of silence , has given us a new appreciation of the word respect . The dry rattle of a funeral drum , the plaintive wail of bagpipes playing " Amazing Grace "  --  these sounds summon our deepest feelings with a new sincerity , to a degree that may have made us blush in the past . // But the past , as it has been said , is a foreign land . It is in the spirit of understanding the distance we have come in a year that CBS News offers this collection of remembrances from the day  --  and the days that followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and very much against our wills , across the border to the lives we know now . // Dan Rather // CBS News // New York City //
