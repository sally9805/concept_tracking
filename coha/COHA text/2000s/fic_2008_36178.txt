UNTAMED ( Chapter 1 ) <p> The caw ! caw ! cawing ! of one stupid crow kept me up all night . ( Well , more accurately , all day  --  ' cause , you know , I 'm a vampyre fledgling and we have that whole issue of day and night being turned around . ) Anyway , I got zero sleep last night/day . But my crappy nonsleep is currently the easiest thing to deal with since life really sucks when your friends are pissed at you . I should know . I 'm Zoey Redbird , currently the undisputed Queen of Making My Friends Pissed Land . <p> Persephone , the big sorrel mare who I could consider mine for as long as I lived at the House of Night , craned her head around and nuzzled my cheek . I kissed her soft muzzle and went back to brushing her sleek neck . Grooming Persephone always helped me think and made me feel better . And I definitely needed help with both of those things . <p> " Okay , so , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that ca n't continue , " I told the mare . " Yes , I know they 're in the cafeteria right now , eating dinner while they hang out together being all buddy-buddy and totally leaving me out . " <p> Persephone snorted and went back to munching hay . <p> " Yeah , I think they 're being jerks , too . Sure , I did lie to them , but it was mostly by omission . And , yeah , I kept some stuff from them . Mostly for their own good . " I sighed . Well , the stuff about Stevie Rae being undead was for their own good . The stuff about me having a thing with Loren Blake  --  Vampyre Poet Laureate and professor at the House of Night  --  well , that was more for my own good . " But still . " Persephone flicked an ear back to listen to me . " They 're being really judgmental . " <p> Persephone snorted again . I sighed again . Crap . I could n't avoid them any longer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I walked slowly out of her stall to the tack room and put up the array of currycombs and mane/tail brushes I 'd been using on her for the past hour . I breathed deeply of the leather and horse smell , letting the soothing mixture ease my nerves . Catching my reflection in the smooth glass window of the tack room , I automatically ran my fingers through my dark hair , trying to make it look not so bedheady . I 'd been Marked as a fledgling vampyre and moved to the House of Night for just over two months , but already my hair was noticeably thicker and longer . And supergood hair was only one of the many changes taking place with me . Some of them were invisible  --  like the fact that I had an affinity for all five of the elements . Some of them were very much visible  --  like the unique tattoos that framed my face in intricate , exotic swirls and then , unlike any other fledgling or adult vampyre , the sapphire design spread down my neck and shoulders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around my waist , a little fact no one but my cat , Nala , our goddess Nyx , and I knew . <p> Like who could I show ? <p> " Well , yesterday you had not one , but three boyfriends , " I told the me with the dark eyes and cynical half smile that was reflected in the glass . " But you fixed that , did n't you ? Today not only do you have zero boyfriends , but no one will ever trust you again for at least , I du n no , a gazillion years or so . " Well , except Aphrodite , who totally freaked and took off two days ago because she might have suddenly been turned back into a human , and Stevie Rae , who was chasing said freaked re-humaned Aphrodite because she might have caused the fledgling-to-human issue when I cast a circle and turned her from creepy undead dead kid to **42;1270;TOOLONG kid . " Either way , " I told myself aloud , " you have managed to mess up just about everyone who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My lip had actually started to quiver and I felt the sting of tears in my eyes . No . Bawling my eyes red would n't do any good . I mean , seriously , if it did , then my friends and I would have kissed ( well , not literally ) and made up days ago . I was just going to have to face them and start trying to make things right . <p> The late December night was cool and a little misty . The gaslights lining the sidewalk that stretched from the stable and field house area of the school to the main building flickered with little haloes of yellow light , looking beautiful and old-worldly . Actually , the whole campus of the House of Night was gorgeous , and always made me think of something that belonged in an Arthurian legend more than in the twenty-first century . I love it here , I reminded myself . It 's home . It 's where I belong . I 'll make it right with my friends , and everything will be okay then . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly how I was going to make it right with my friends when my mental stressing was interrupted by a weird flapping noise that filled the air around me . Something about the sound sent a chill down my spine . I looked up . There was nothing above me but darkness and sky and the winter-bare limbs of the huge oaks that lined the sidewalk . I shivered , having a walking-over-my-grave moment as the night went from soft and misty to dark and malevolent . <p> Hang on  --  dark and malevolent ? Well , that 's just silly ! What I had heard was probably nothing more sinister than the wind rustling through the trees . Jeesh , I was losing it . <p> Shaking my head at myself , I kept walking but had taken only a couple of steps when it happened again . The weird flapping above me actually caused the air , which seemed ten degrees colder , to flutter wildly against my skin . I automatically flailed a hand up , imagining bats and spiders and all sorts of creepy things . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothingness , and an icy pain sliced through my hand . Completely freaked out , I yelped and hugged my hand to my chest . For a moment I did n't know what to do , and my body was numb with fear . The flapping was getting louder and the cold more intense when I finally managed to move . Ducking my head , I did the only thing I could think to do . I ran for the nearest door to the school . <p> After slipping inside , I slammed the thick wooden door behind me and , panting for breath , turned to peer through the little arched window in the center of it . The night shifted and swam before my eyes , like black paint poured down a dark page . Still , the terrible feeling of icy fear lingered within me . What was going on ? Almost without realizing what I was doing , I whispered , " Fire , come to me . I need your warmth . " <p> Instantly the element responded , filling the air around me with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little window , I pressed my palms against the rough wood of the door . " Out there , " I murmured . " Send your heat out there , too . " With a whoosh of warmth , the element moved from me , through the door , and poured into the night . There was a hissing sound , like steam rising from dry ice . The mist roiled , thick and soupy , giving me a sense of dizzy vertigo that made me a little nauseated , and the strange darkness began to evaporate . Then the heat completely beat away the chill , and as suddenly as it had begun , the night was once again quiet and familiar . <p> What had just happened ? <p> My stinging hand drew my attention from the window . I looked down . Across the back of my hand there were red welts , as though something with claws , or talons , had scraped across my flesh . I rubbed at the angry-looking marks , which stung like a curling iron burn . <p> Then the feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew with my Goddess-given sixth sense that I should n't be here by myself . The coldness that had tainted the night  --  the ghostly something that had chased me inside and welted my hand  --  filled me with a terrible foreboding and for the first time in a long time , I was truly and utterly afraid . Not for my friends . Not for my grandma or my human ex-boyfriend , or even for my estranged mom . I was afraid for myself . I did n't just want the company of my friends ; I needed them . <p> Still rubbing my hand , I made my legs move and knew beyond any doubt that I would rather face the hurt and disappointment of my friends than whatever dark thing might be waiting for me in the concealing night . <p> I hovered for a second just outside the open doors to the busy " dining hall " ( a.k.a. school cafeteria ) watching the other kids talk easily and happily together , and I was almost overwhelmed with the sudden wish that I could be just another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or the responsibilities that went along with those abilities . For a second I wanted to be normal so bad that it was hard for me to breathe . <p> Then I felt the soft brush of wind against my skin that seemed warmed by the heat of an invisible flame . I caught a whiff of the ocean , even though there is definitely no ocean near Tulsa , Oklahoma . I heard birdsong and smelled new-cut grass . And my spirit quivered with silent joy within me as it acknowledged my powerful Goddess-given gifts of an affinity for each of the five elements : air , fire , water , earth , and spirit . <p> I was n't normal . I was n't like anyone else , fledgling or vampyre , and it was wrong of me to wish otherwise . And part of my not-normal-ness was telling me that I had to go in there and try to make peace with my friends . I straightened my spine and looked around the room with eyes that were clear of self-pity , and easily found my special group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and then made my way quickly across the cafeteria , giving a little nod or small smile to the kids who said hi to me . I noticed that everyone seemed to be reacting to me with their usual mix of respect and awe , which meant that my friends had n't been talking crap about me to the masses . It also meant that Neferet had n't launched an all-out , open attack against me . Yet . <p> I grabbed a quick salad and a brown pop . Then , holding on to my tray with such abnormal tightness that it was turning my fingers white , I marched straight to our booth and took my usual seat beside Damien . <p> When I sat down , no one looked at me , but their easy chatter instantly died , which is something I totally hate . I mean , what 's more awful than walking up to a group of your supposed-to-be friends and having them all shut up so that you knew for sure they were all talking about you ? Ugh . <p> " Hi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into tears like I wanted to . <p> No one said anything . <p> " So , what 's up ? " I directed the question at Damien , knowing that my gay friend was naturally the weakest link in the don't-talk-to-Zoey chain . <p> Sadly , it was the Twins who answered me and not gay , and therefore more sensitive and polite , Damien . <p> " Not shit , right , Twin ? " said Shaunee . <p> " That 's right , Twin , not shit . ' Cause we ca n't be trusted to know shit , " Erin said . " Twin , did you know we 're totally untrustworthy ? " <p> " Not until recently I did n't , Twin . You ? " Shaunee said . <p> " Did n't know till recently either , " Erin finished . <p> Okay , the Twins are n't really twins . Shaunee Cole is a caramel-colored Jamaican-American who grew up on the East Coast . Erin Bates is a gorgeous blonde who was born in Tulsa . The two met after being Marked and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They clicked instantly  --  it 's like genetics and geography never existed . They literally finish each other 's sentences . And at that moment they were glaring at me with twin looks of angry suspicion . <p> God , they made me tired . <p> They also made me mad . Yes , I 'd kept secrets from them . Yes , I 'd lied to them . But I 'd had to . Well , mostly I 'd had to . And their twin holier-than-thou crap was getting on my last nerve . <p> " Thank you for that lovely commentary . And now I 'll try asking someone who does n't have to answer in a stereo version of hateful Gossip Girl Blair . " I turned my attention away from them and looked directly at Damien , even though I could hear the Twins sucking air and getting ready to say something I was hoping they would one day regret . " So , I guess what I really wanted to ask when I said ' what 's up ' is if you 've noticed any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " <p> Damien 's a tall , really cute guy with excellent bone structure whose brown eyes were usually warm and expressive but were , at this moment , wary and more than a little cold . " A flappy ghost thing ? " he said . " Sorry , I have no clue what you 're talking about . " <p> My heart squeezed at the strangerlike tone of his voice , but I told myself that at least he 'd answered my question . " On the way here from the stables , something kinda attacked me . I could n't really see anything , but it was cold and it put a big welt on my hand . " I lifted my hand to show him  --  and there was no welt there anymore . <p> Great . <p> Shaunee and Erin snorted together . Damien just looked really , really sad . I was opening my mouth to explain that there had been a welt there just a few minutes ago , when Jack rushed up . <p> " Oh , hi ! I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my shirt I found a ginormic stain right on the front of it . Can you believe that ? " Jack said as he hurried up with his tray of food and sat at his place beside Damien . <p> " A stain ? It 's not on that lovely blue long-sleeved Armani I got you for Christmas , is it ? " Damien said , scooting over to make room for his boyfriend . <p> " Ohmigod , no ! I 'd never spill anything on that one . I just love it and  --  " His words came to a staggering halt when his eyes flitted from Damien to me . He gulped . " Oh , uh . Hi , Zoey . " <p> " Hi , Jack , " I said , smiling at him . Jack and Damien are together . Hello . They 're gay . My friends and I , along with anyone who 's not narrow-minded and utterly judgmental , are cool with that . <p> " I did n't expect to see you , " Jack babbled . " I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . " He trailed off , looking uncomfortable and blushing a pretty pink . <p> " You thought I was still hiding in my room ? " I supplied for him . <p> He nodded . <p> " No . " I said firmly , " I 'm done doing that . " <p> " Well , la-te-da , " Erin began , but before Shaunee could do her usual chime-in act , a blatantly sexy laugh coming from the door behind us made everyone turn and gawk . <p> Aphrodite twitched into the room , laughing while she batted her eyes at Darius , one of the youngest and hottest of the Sons of Erebus Warriors who protected the House of Night , and did an excellent hair flip . The girl always had been good at multitasking , but I was totally shocked at how nonchalant and utterly cool and collected she looked . Only two days ago she 'd been almost dead and then utterly freaked because the sapphire-colored outline of a crescent moon  --  which appeared on all fledglings ' foreheads , Marking them as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vampyre or in becoming dead  --  had disappeared from her face . <p> Which meant she had somehow turned back into a human . <p> <p> Copyright 2008 P.C.
