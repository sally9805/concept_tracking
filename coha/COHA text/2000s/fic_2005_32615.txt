Chapter One There 's a bow tied around my neck and I 'm dying for a smoke . Tonight 's the senior prom and there 's no way I 'm going to get through this ordeal sober . I would n't be going at all , but I promised my girlfriend , Emily . She said the prom only happens once in your life and I 'd regret it if I blew the whole thing off . " Humor me , " she said . On the off chance she 's right , I agreed to take her-a decision I now regret . I figure if I catch a buzz before I pick her up , maybe the night wo n't be a total disaster . Emily always says she ca n't stand being around stoners , but then again she can never tell when I 'm stoned . Besides , there 's no use complaining now . I have the whole thing lined up-the black tux , the white limo , the red corsage . I even rented a room at the Hyatt . It 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not like I think some cheesy hotel room will make Emily want to sleep with me . I know she wo n't . It 's not even worth trying . I probably wo n't even tell her I got it . If she ever wants to go all the way , she 'll let me know . Her parents left her home alone for an entire weekend last month and she still would n't put out . A hotel room is n't going to make any difference . The most we ever do is kiss , sometimes until our lips are chapped . Every time I try to push it a little farther , she pulls away and I stop . Supposedly , most guys do n't . Like the guys she used to go out with . From what I can figure , they did n't take no for an answer and I do n't want to be like them , so I always apologize and say , " Whenever you 're ready . " You might think that makes me a good guy , but most people around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've heard people say that Emily was a slut at her old school , Fairview High . It 's only a couple miles away from Chelsea . News gets around and sometimes I listen . Not that it really matters . People say a lot worse about their so-called best friends . From the very beginning she told me she wanted to take things slow and that was fine with me . After three years of high school I 'd never even been on a date , so going slow sounded a lot better than going nowhere at all . I 'm pretty sure Emily does n't care about the prom anyway . She wants to shed her old skin . Going to the prom is really about making a new memory to replace the old ones she wants to forget . Deep down I 'll bet she knows it 's a big joke , but you 'd have to ask her . That 's the only way you ever know what 's going on in someone else 's head and even then you ca n't be too sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in bits and pieces . She once told me how her dad found her drunk at Larry 's down on High Street , sitting in some guy 's lap . Another time she got so wasted at a Beastie Boys concert she had to have her stomach pumped . She 's been arrested for shoplifting , but she wo n't tell me what she stole . Like she says , it does n't matter . But if you put all the pieces together it looks like a blur , a girl out of control . She 's not like that anymore ; so maybe going to the prom is a small price for me to pay . My sister , Annika , on the other hand , cares a lot about the prom . Even though she 's only in the fifth grade and I 'm about to go to college , in a lot of ways I think of her as my best friend . I can tell her anything and know she 'd never rat me out . That 's a lot rarer than it ought to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she gets into sixth grade , it 'll all change . That 's when girls start thinking about boys . That 's when they turn mean . Last week Annika was begging me to help pick out my tux . Not that she had to , I would have taken her anyway . Without her or someone else from the family in the car , I 'm not allowed to drive . Dad says driving is not a right but a privilege . He says he 's doing it for my own good . If I had a gallon of gas for every time I heard that , I could have escaped to California by now . Dad figures with Annika in the car I wo n't try anything stupid and if I do , he 's under the false impression she 'll report back to him . The truth is , I 'm really not such a bad driver ; I 've just had some bad luck . First of all , I should point out in my defense-and despite objections from the insurance company-that it was completely not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That distinction belonged to Mr. Bailey , the so-called instructor . The one who was there to teach me how to drive . He was hard to take seriously . After all , no one grows up wanting to be a driver 's ed instructor . In order to get that job , some serious vocational errors must be made along the way . Throw in the facts that he smelled like broccoli , never cleaned his glasses , and spoke often of Freemasonry and it 's not so hard to see how it came to this . Mr. Bailey did n't have too many driving tips to share , but he frequently ranted about how all the kids around here have been bred to be cogs in the machine and they do n't even know it . Maybe I was going a little too fast , but I only wanted to get out of the car . Bailey was babbling on and on about how fluoride is the main ingredient in rat poison . " It lowers your IQ , crumbles your bones , and causes cancer . People think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system , but it 's the fluoride . " After a while , he was n't so hard to tune out . Later , Mr. Bailey would tell the cops , " I told him to slow down . " More than once , he said that . That 's the thing about conspiracy theorists-they never take personal responsibility for anything . Whatever happens is the result of some sinister plot . Even though he was n't at the wheel , Mr. Bailey was in control . He had his own set of brakes . He could do what he wanted . Any objective observer could see , it was Mr. Bailey who panicked , not me . Had he not freaked out and slammed on the brakes , we never would have fishtailed into the plaza in front of City Hall , headed straight for a statue of our city 's namesake . When Christopher Columbus hit the ground , his head fell off and rolled down Front Street . You might have seen a picture of it in the paper . No one got hurt , but everyone acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the time , though , I could n't stop laughing , which is probably why the cops thought I was drunk . But what was even funnier was Mr. Bailey . He was having a fit , wheezing about how he was n't going to be framed . I do n't know why he was so upset . He 'd only told me a dozen times how Columbus was a slave trader and a rapist and how if the natives did n't bring him all the gold he wanted , he 'd chop off their arms . Mr. Bailey often said , " Everything they teach you in that stuck-up school is a lie , a goddamn lie . " The destruction of such an esteemed civic icon really would have been a wonderful opportunity for Mr. Bailey to initiate a city-wide dialogue over why our landlocked town is named after the seafaring Christopher Columbus in the first place . But all he could talk about was how I was trying to ruin his life . Like he had n't already done that all on his own . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a big deal to me , going to a department store to get fitted for a tux , but Annika has always loved getting dressed up . Any occasion will do . She 's old- fashioned that way . " Monroe , we 're going to the Lazarus downtown , right ? " " That 's right . " " Not the one at the mall . " " Yes , we 're going downtown . " " And you 're going to wear that ? " The Lazarus store downtown used to be a pretty elegant place , unlike the one at the Chelsea mall , which is a fortress made of glazed turquoise brick . Mom calls it architectural vomit . But the downtown Lazarus is different . It 's like 1948 , not that I know what 1948 was like ; but when you walk through the cast-iron doors you could be walking into a black-and-white movie . Lazarus keeps the tuxedoes on the fourth floor in the back . I wanted to get one in baby blue , just to make it clear I was n't taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " Monroe , " she said , " you 'll look back at pictures of yourself and wonder what you were thinking . Is that what you want ? " I look at myself in the mirror and cringe as it is . I ca n't imagine how looking back on photos will be any different . She insisted on a classic cut . " You 'll look like William Powell and Emily will be Myrna Loy ... or better yet Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire . " Annika wants to be a dancer . She watches those old movies all the time . When I came out of the dressing room , she came right up to me all serious , brushed off my lapels , and asked , " May I have this dance ? " I 'm telling you , she 's going to break some hearts someday , she really will . You 'll see . " Of course , my lady . " I know it sounds kind of gay , dancing with your sister like that , especially in public . But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother insisted on , dance lessons . " There are a lot of things you can fake in this life and dancing is not one of them , " she said . It 's right up there with , " People always say dance like no one 's watching , but the thing to remember is this : they are watching and you can bet they wish they were dancing , too . " Annika and I used to dance all the time . It did n't matter that I have about a foot and a half on her ; she could always keep up . It was n't cheesy , you know , like at weddings when you see old people dancing with little girls . She really knew what she was doing . People at school used to call me a faggot because I took dance class , like it was something to be ashamed of . And it worked . I was ashamed . Being called a faggot will do that to you . I wanted to quit and Mom would have let me too . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do the boys who call you names do at the school dances ? " I told her they all hang around on the edges . They do n't dance at all . " That 's interesting . You 're dancing with girls and they 're not , yet you 're the faggot . " Sometimes the most obvious things go right over your head when you 're a kid . We finished with a big dip and the clerks all clapped . It figures , they sell clothes . Annika never worried if people laughed at her . She always assumed everyone else was in on the joke and I 've always assumed the joke was on me . When I was eleven I was mortified if I was n't wearing the right shoes to school . But Annika just never cared what other people thought . Maybe if you do n't care , other people do n't care much either . Maybe it 's like how dogs only bite people who are afraid of them . After they made some alterations , we got milk shakes at the old-fashioned fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . It was just us and Sam , the old black man who works the counter . He 's been working at Lazarus forever . Sam 's a nice man , but kind of slow . Mom says he 's thick-just like his shakes . " It does n't look like anyone comes here much anymore , " I said . " They do n't , son , they sure do n't , " Sam said as he continued polishing the counter , not missing a beat . He concentrated his efforts on one spot , gliding his hands over and over it again . I inhaled my shake , but Annika took her time . She said , " Mr. Sam , you make the best milk shakes in the world . " He just smiled and kept rubbing that one spot , considering the praise . Then he looked up at us and said , " I wish I could make more . " When I was a kid , before they built a new mall next door , Lazurus was packed on Saturdays . But sitting there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a museum visiting a relic from the past , like the way they have blacksmiths banging out horseshoes and women spinning lamb 's wool at the Ohio Historical Society . If they ever close the store , maybe that 's where Sam will end up . In a museum . The mall next door-that was so new and popular just a few years ago-quickly filled with ghosts . New , better malls with more things to do popped up on the outskirts , effectively killing the downtown renaissance before they even had a chance to build an IMAX . If you 've already done the math , then you 'd know I was seven years old when Annika was born . It was kind of an unexpected bonus-no longer being the youngest . I could hardly wait for her to arrive . I learned so much about the infliction of pain from my older brother , I was eager to impart my wisdom to the younger generation . I spent my first seven years as an unwitting scientific experiment . Scientific , however , suggests it was all documented for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were no lab notes . No charts . No graphs . Only a constant stream of misery . Dad always said our family was part Austrian , but all you had to do was see my brother , Ben , in action to realize our German roots ran deep . I could have written a book like Anne Frank , detailing the occupation , but Ben would have found it and rubbed every word in my face like broken glass . ( Continues ... )
