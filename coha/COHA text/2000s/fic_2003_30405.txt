Chapter One I was smoking a cigarette at the bar , an empty glass before me , wondering whether I should have another or leave , when I felt a hand on my shoulder . A rather deep , pleasant voice said , Let me treat you to a whiskey . I do n't like drinking alone . I bet you do n't either . There was no reason to refuse . It was n't as though I were expected elsewhere . I nodded and followed him to a table . Seeing a waiter lounge unoccupied within hailing distance , he ordered a bottle of whiskey , ice , and soda water . We were served with surly efficiency . With a sigh of what I took to be satisfaction , he crossed and recrossed the ankles of the long , thin legs stretched out before him , and looked about . I too once more took in the flickering lights , the grouping of shadows at other tables , and the murmur of voices . After a moment , he broke the silence : I should introduce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed slightly and reciprocated the politeness . Abruptly , he spoke again , this man so like me in appearance and demeanor , from the crown of his neatly barbered head to the tips of his brogues , well worn but beautifully polished . Listen , he said . Listen . I will tell you a story I have never told before . If you hear me out , you will see why . I would have been a fool to tell it . With you , somehow I feel secure . Call it instinct or impulse or fate-your choice . Besides , could it possibly matter what I say to you over a pleasant drink here , at L'Entre Deux Mondes ? Something in what he had said or had failed to say must have amused him hugely . He laughed to the point of tears . It was a moment before he got hold of himself and was able to continue . Is not this benighted place the perfect no-man's-land ? he asked . I made no comment . Well , speak up , said North , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say to you here ? I am by nature shy and uncommunicative . This intimacy that nothing justified and that I had done nothing to encourage put me on my guard . At the same time , I did not wish to rebuff out of hand what might turn out to be a harmless conversational gambit . It seemed best to say nothing . North nodded , perhaps to indicate that in the end my silence did n't matter either . I suppose it will strike you as droll , he said , that my story should begin at a cafe . A cafe in Paris that you may know . By the way , are you familiar with my work ? I mean my novels . Seeing what was no doubt my blank expression , he laughed and said , Do n't worry , I much prefer honesty to polite lies I see through immediately . It does n't matter , please do n't protest . I will simply assume that you have n't read a word of mine . Take it on faith though that for many years I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commercial success . When this story begins , my then most recent novel , The Anthill , had been out for a little over six months , having been published in the States in the fall of the previous year . The French translation had just appeared . It was displayed in the windows of most bookstores in Paris , and you could find it even at the newsstands at Roissy and Orly , which normally carry only French best-sellers and foreign trash . I have always had the same publisher in France . He published The Anthill and all my earlier novels . His name is Xavier Roche , and over the years he has become a friend . I was in Paris at his invitation . It was n't exactly a book tour . Nothing of real importance in literary life happens in the French provinces anyway . Rather , the idea was to spend a week or so in Paris and be interviewed by print journalists . If I was very lucky , I would appear on Apostrophes , a television show about books that has a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But that did n't happen . Mind you , I had some things going for me . All my novels were available in French , I have always had good reviews in France , and my spoken French is almost native , altogether an unusual profile for an American writer . Xavier hoped to exploit these advantages , especially since he had nothing by a " name " French author to bring out that year . So it happened that I found myself in May , on a gray afternoon of the sort that makes you want to curl up and go to sleep , at the cafe Flore , being interviewed by a young woman for a feature on me to appear in French Vogue . No , I 'm not that kind of novelist , I assure you ; but when there is a " peg " they can use , the glossies sometimes do profiles of serious writers , and even run a competent review . What was the peg here ? My modest celebrity in the States and in France , the various storied adventures of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and there , and especially in Paris , and the fact that I had lived in Paris myself . Whatever the reason , the article had been assigned , and there was a possibility that American and British Vogue would pick it up in translation . A photo session was to follow directly . When the journalist-I really mean to say the girl , since I could n't help thinking of her as such , not because she was juvenile , I guessed her age was somewhere between twenty-five and thirty , probably closer to thirty , but because something in her looks and in her chipper professional manner made me think of the " girl reporter " type in movies of the 1940s . Anyway , when the girl asked whether I would like to have a cup of coffee while the photographer and his assistant set up , I accepted . I was pleased with the interview . She had read my work carefully and also knew much of what had been written about me . Her questions were intelligent . As soon as I said yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cafe away from where we had sat during the interview . I supposed that she wanted to avoid our being disturbed by the photographer . Or overheard . Thank you for everything , she said . For your books and this interview . You were really eloquent . The new book is wonderful . I think it will be very well received . The coffee and the scotch I had ordered for myself presented a distraction that allowed me not to answer right away . I drank the coffee quickly , while it was scalding hot , which is my habit , and asked for another . Then I worked on my drink , stirring the ice cubes in the glass . Of course , I knew I had been eloquent . She might as well have said brilliant . And the prospects for my book ? At home , the reviews in the newspapers and magazines that count had been favorable , leaving aside the few cranks who always go after me for personal or ideological reasons . There had been some raves as well . All the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soured my mood . It was n't only my ingrained dread of optimism and premature congratulations , although there is much to be said for this particular superstition , one of many that I am mostly proud of . For instance , when we drive from the city to our place on Long Island , near the property of my wife 's parents , I always plead with her not to tell me , before we have as much as crossed the Triborough Bridge , that the traffic is moving well . Without exception , every time she says it , immediately we get stuck in a jam behind an overturned truck or the like . It 's guaranteed . No , it was n't what the girl had said that bothered me . She spoke the inevitable truth : The Anthill would get good reviews followed by anemic sales . But Xavier could n't blame me or my book for that . It 's simply the fate of ninety-nine percent of translated novels in the French market . I knew the roots of my sudden disquiet . They were different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a discovery I had made recently while Lydia-my wife-was away in Hawaii , attending a congress on kidney disease in infants and very young children , a subject on which she is a great authority . I was alone in New York and idle . The new project I had in mind was too unformed for me to start writing . At most , I could have taken notes on what I might do later , but I did n't , taking notes and making outlines being forms of activity I ordinarily eschew . I did n't especially want to see friends , and I was too impatient-nervous , really-to do any serious reading . Usually I welcome this state of wary inertia into which my mind drifts between books . It makes me receptive to impressions that I would otherwise miss or seize incompletely , and yet these are the very impressions that later nourish my work . So it was without my having intended it , by accident-but I think it was the sort of inevitable accident that waits for you-that I found myself sitting in judgment on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found annoying because of a cruel streak that ran through it , rather at odds with the banal and fundamentally cheerful plot . The screenwriter or the director had spoiled it by putting on airs . Afterward , I had a plate of pasta at the only restaurant in my neighborhood that serves real food after eleven . My first thought , when I got home , was to go straight to bed . But I was too tense and irritated , so I poured myself a drink and took it into the library . There are things you do only when you are alone . I sauntered over to the shelves reserved for the first editions of my novels and their translations and stroked the familiar spines . Then , as though under a compulsion I was unable to resist , I took down first the new book and later all the others and looked at certain passages . I was to remain in my armchair the whole night and the next day , and most of the night that followed , with hardly any pause , although I suspected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At a certain point , entire sentences I had written seemed to disintegrate like figures in a kaleidoscope when you turn the tube , only my words did not regroup and coalesce as new wonders of color and design . They lay on the page like so many vulgar , odious pieces of shattered glass . The conclusion I reached came down to this : none of my books , neither the new novel nor any I had written before , was very good . Certainly , none possessed the literary merit that critical opinion ascribed to them . Not even my second novel , the one that won all the prizes and was said to confirm my standing as an important novelist . No , they all belonged to the same dreary breed of unneeded books . Novels that are not embarrassingly bad but lead you to wonder why the author had bothered . Unless , of course , he had only a small ambition : to earn a modest sum of money and short-lived renown . You can see how these feelings , unknown to the girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pas . North refilled our glasses and looked at me brightly . There is a reason , he said , for telling you about this somber little epiphany , although in itself it may not interest you . It 's a part of the setting . Without it , you might not be able to judge fairly what followed . I mumbled assent . The whiskeys I had drunk had induced in me a sort of hypnagogic state . Time no longer mattered . And what should one think of a man who writes such books , he continued , where does he belong if not to the race of trimmers , men who live without infamy and without praise , envious of any other fate ? He did not wait for me to answer this question , which I took anyway to be rhetorical . Instead , he resumed his monologue : Always be alert among such men to their capacity for envy , even if it 's not center stage ! Actually , trimmers of my kind do get praise , but it 's never enough . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better praise although he is less deserving . Yes , it came upon me painfully that I had wasted my time writing the stuff . Those enthusiastic reviews that had greeted my new novel in the American and English press , and still continued to straggle in from the odd magazines , the praise that had made me blush with pleasure and had delighted Lydia , should have reddened me with shame . Sitting there with the girl at the Flore , thinking about my discovery , I recalled especially the review faxed by my agent , which I had read at breakfast that very day . Somehow , I had misled , in fact duped , the reviewer who wrote it , an astute and immensely scrupulous woman whom I admire , duped her , like so many of her colleagues , into finding in my work qualities that I , with my eyes newly open , knowing my work as only the author can , every sentence and paragraph , could certify were entirely absent . Such articles , which moved my agent , my editor , and my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't they in the end serve only to enlarge the con game ? And now this girl , with her chatter , and the profile with which I was brazenly collaborating , was going to add to the scandal , and to the vast accumulation of my shame . North paused , evidently upset . He rubbed his eyes . The gesture seemed to be a tic of which he was aware . After a while he continued . I had drunk my baby whiskey , so I asked the girl if she would reconsider and join me while I had a second larger drink . No , but she would have another coffee . She wanted to continue reviewing her notes . That was all right with me ; no is no . Meanwhile , since she had really launched me into orbit , I continued my own review of my monstrous predicament . There was no doubt that I had become a novelist honestly , thinking there was a world of stories in my head waiting to be told , and that I knew how to tell them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young , straight out of college ; my only trade . I was qualified to do nothing else : not to sell insurance or manage a restaurant or trade commodities futures or perform any of the other tasks requiring no hard physical labor but still deemed useful and worth paying for . Only a preposterous public recantation could purge the fraud . I knew of one writer who had so rejected his work , but the disavowal had coincided in his case with his new conviction , almost religious in nature , that he had found a different way to write that was worthy . I had nothing like that up my sleeve . Perhaps the only honorable solution was to scrap the book I had just begun and forever after keep my peace . ( Continues ... )
