A year with two is an absolute bonanza . Three is pretty much unheard of . Yet that 's exactly the kind of bumper crop that full-size pickup truck buyers will enjoy this year , with brand-new models coming from Ford , Nissan and Toyota . Our focus here is on the light-duty segment of the pickup market , since that 's where all the new introductions are taking place . Rest assured , however , that even though these trucks fall into the " personal use " pickup category , they are engineered so as not to fail those outdoorsmen who see their trucks more as tools than toys . A word about pricing : As of this writing , the domestic truck makers have announced 2004 model-year prices ; the Japanese makers have not . By the time you read this , however , your local dealer should have up-to-date pricing information . CHEVROLET/GMC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so there are limited  --  but important  --  changes for 2004 . Chevrolet is expanding the availability of its Quadrasteer rear-steer system to 1500-series Extended-Cab short-box models , and the crew-cab body style will become available mid-year on Chevy and GMC 1500 chassis for the first time . GM has revamped several of its option packages . Base trucks have features such as chrome bumpers , cruise control and uplevel wheels as standard equipment . The Work Truck package , which includes a painted grille and bumpers , a V-6/manual transmission power train and 16-inch steel wheels , can be ordered on all Silverado models . And Chevrolet 's Z71 off-road package now combines amenities such as power windows and door locks , cruise control , remote keyless entry and an AM/FM/CD/cassette stereo with the suspension upgrades and extra skid plates available previously . ( General Motors Corp. , 800-462-8782 , www.chevrolet.com ) DODGE For 2004 , Dodge replaces its 5.9-liter Magnum V-8 engine across the Ram line with the smaller but more powerful 5.7-liter Hemi . That means the Ram 1500 , when equipped with the 345-horsepower Hemi , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " according to Dodge . ( Only Ford 's 380hp SVT Lightning pickup beats it , and that truck is not exactly " mass-produced . " ) Dodge has also introduced a full-time AWD ( all-wheel-drive ) system with an electric-shift transfer case for the Ram . Unlike some AWD systems on the market , this transfer case has both high and low ranges . This year the top-of-the-line Ram is the Laramie model , distinguished by its chrome grille and unique leather upholstery . For those more interested in " go " than " show , " an Off-Road package includes 32-inch-tall LT275/70R17 all-terrain tires , multiple skid plates , specially tuned shock absorbers and lower axle ratios , plus a limited-slip differential in the rear axle . There is also a Work Special package that replaces the Ram 's brightwork with a dark gray front fascia , painted rear bumper and steel wheels . Unfortunately , the Hemi is not available in this " stealth " trim at this time . ( DaimlerChrysler Corp. , 800-423-6343 , www.dodge.com ) FORD The freshening of the F-150 's looks belies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revisions . The F-150 's boxed frame is now nine times stiffer than that of the previous model , and suspension enhancements , including wider leaf springs and rear shock absorbers mounted outboard of the leaves , were designed in tandem with the stiffer frame , giving the truck best-in-class ride characteristics . Under the hood , the 5.4-liter Triton V-8 has been massaged to provide a 15 percent horsepower improvement . Regular and SuperCab cabins are 6 inches longer to provide more cargo and passenger room , respectively , and the Regular Cab body now features access doors at the back of the cab . Even the beds on these trucks were revisited and made 2 inches deeper to increase cargo capacity . There are now five distinct F-150 models , from the base XL to the top-shelf Lariat . Each has its own list of standard and optional equipment , as well as a different interior treatment to reflect the trim level 's " personality . " Those of you with serious off-road intentions should shop the FX4 model , with its standard 300-horsepower V-8 , off-road-tuned shocks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-new 2004 trucks , Ford is carrying over last year 's model as the F-150 Heritage . These pickups are outfitted with equipment not available on the new trucks , such as V-6 engines and manual transmissions , and many models feature carry-over prices , too . ( Ford Motor Co. , 800-392-3673 , www.ford.com ) NISSAN Nissan 's all-new Titan is a true full-size pickup in every sense of the word . Its exterior and interior dimensions are virtually identical to those of the 2004 Ford F-150 ; its maximum towing capacity also meets the new Ford 's ; and the Titan 's 5.6-liter " Endurance " V-8 outperforms Ford 's new 5.4-liter V-8 . When it goes on sale December 1 , the Titan will be offered in King Cab and Crew Cab configurations . Both are the same length overall ; the four-door Crew Cab trades a foot in bed length and a little cargo capacity for increased rear-seat legroom . The Endurance V-8 , mated to a five-speed automatic transmission , is the only power train available , but it 's plenty strong for most needs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The King Cab 's rear doors open nearly 180 degrees to ease cargo and passenger loading . A High Utility bed option includes a sprayed-in bed liner , an adjustable tie-down channel system and a small lockable storage compartment on the outside of the bed behind the left rear wheel . The Off-Road package not only includes the usual all-terrain tires , skid plates and special shock absorbers , but will have an electric locking rear differential by springtime . There were avid hunters on the Titan 's development team , so prototype trucks have already been field-tested on elk and deer hunts . Those same engineers are looking into developing a line of outdoor accessories , such as dog boxes , to fit the optional High Utility bed tie-down channels . ( Nissan Motor Co. , 800-647-7261 , www.nissanmotors.com ) TOYOTA Like Nissan , Toyota had Ford trucks squarely in its sights when its engineers began designing the new Double-Cab version of the Tundra pickup . The D-Cab is longer , wider and taller overall than Ford 's F-150 SuperCrew model , and its cabin offers as much interior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The D-Cab 's bed is longer than the Super Crew 's ( and the Titan Crew Cab 's ) , and it 's 4 inches deeper than other Tundra boxes . About the only component Toyota did n't enlarge is the D-Cab 's engine , which is the same 240-horse , 4.7-liter V-8 available in the regular- and Access-Cab Tundra models . Accessories , including a bed liner and SnugTop shell , are already available for the new Tundra . To facilitate cargo pass-through between the cab and the bed , Toyota borrowed a trick from its SUVs and designed the rear window to slide down into the cab via an electric motor . Toyota 's performance arm , TRD , developed an Off-Road package that includes revised springs and Bilstein shocks , 30-inch-tall P265/70R16 BFGoodrich Rugged Trail all-terrain tires , skid plates , mud guards , fog lights and fender flares  --  just about everything a sportsman could ask for .

Both feature three cab configurations ( Regular , Extended Cab and Crew Cab ) and two box lengths ( 6 feet on Regular and Extended Cab models , 5 feet on Crew Cabs ) .

Prices for 4WD versions of the trucks start at $18,760 for a base-level , Regular Cab Colorado , $19,140 for a Canyon in similar trim . Illustration <p>
