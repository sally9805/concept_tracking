The New New York Times : All The News That Fits , They Print // There is a new New York Times . Howell Raines 's New York Times . No longer content to report the news , he admits to " flooding the zone "  --  and floods it with stories that carry forward his personal crusades and the paper 's editorial views . And the Times does n't stop at slanting the news ; it also weights its polls . The surveys the newspaper takes regularly are biased to give more strength to Democratic and liberal opinions and less to those of the rest of us. // The newspaper has become like a political consulting firm for the Democratic Party . Under Raines , it is squandering the unparalleled credibility it has amassed over the past century in order to articulate and advance its own political and ideological agenda . For decades , the Times was the one newspaper so respected for its integrity and so widely read that it had influence well beyond its circulation . Now it has stooped to the role of partisan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flames of disagreement on the left . Each month brings a new left party line from the paper , setting the tone for the government 's loyal opposition . // Reading the New York Times these days is like listening to Radio Moscow . Not that it 's communist , of course , but it has become almost as biased as the former Soviet news organ that religiously spewed the party line . Just as Russians did under Soviet rule , you now need to read " between the lines " to distinguish what 's really happening from what is just New York Times propaganda . // I have read the New York Times for forty-four years . When I was growing up , my parents read it every morning and the New York Post every afternoon . I still read them both every day . The Times is a New York institution to me , as much a symbol of my hometown as the Yankees , the subway , Central Park , and , yes , the World Trade Center . I think many Americans must share my feelings today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after so many years of dignity and balance , is like watching your father get drunk . // Like every newspaper , the Times rightfully uses its editorial and op-ed pages to articulate its ideas and opinions . But , since the ascension of Howell Raines to the post of managing editor , the newspaper has gone much , much further to push its political perspective . As journalist Ken Auletta pointed out in a masterful profile in The New Yorker , Raines is overt about his desire that " the masthead " ( the managing editor , his deputy , and the assistant managing editors ) " be more engaged in shaping stories and coordinating news coverage . " // Acting like the chief campaign strategist for the left , the Times generally conducts six to eight public opinion polls each year . But lately the Times seems to me to be deliberately misinterpreting and weighting its data to suggest that its liberal ideas have a popularity they do n't actually enjoy . The polling seems to have one major purpose  --  to help the Democratic Party set its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liberalism on a host of issues . Then , from editorials to op-ed articles and a blizzard of front-page stories , the newspaper relentlessly expounds its views , doing its best to create a national firestorm on the issues it chooses to push . // Jack Shafer , the media critic for the on-line magazine Slate , described the new policy to Newsweek on December 9 , 2002 : " The Times has assumed the journalistic role as the party of opposition " to the current Bush administration . According to Newsweek , " many people around the country are noticing a change in the way the Old Gray Lady the Times 's pet name covers any number of issues . . . . " The magazine pointed out how Raines believes in " flooding the zone  --  using all the paper 's formidable resources to pound away on a story . " // Other newspapers often try to do the same thing . What is unique about the Times 's approach is the sharp departure it represents from the paper 's past . Long priding itself on objectivity , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Times is renowned as our nation 's primary voice of objective authority . As such , it occupies a unique place in our national iconography . But Alex Jones , author of The Trust , a book about the Times , describes the Times 's latter-day style of news coverage as " certainly a shift from the New York Times as the ' paper of record . ' " // And yet millions of us still rely on the New York Times . It is still the most comprehensive source of news and information about what is going on in the world . It is precisely because it is so important that the bias that increasingly dominates its coverage of news is so disturbing . It 's a little like finding propaganda in the World Almanac  --  the place you want to go to get the facts and only the facts . If we can not depend on the Times to tell us fairly , accurately , and dispassionately what is going on , where are we supposed to turn ? Will news reading become a task in which we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the truth ? Is it really worth subverting an institution like the New York Times just to score political points ? // Every day 's front page is such a mix of hype , hyperbole , and , often , hypocrisy that it takes an expert to sort it out . // While most nations have their national newspapers , American newspapers , with the exception of USA Today and the Wall Street Journal , are all local in orientation . The New York Times , however , leads a double life  --  as the most widely read newspaper in the nation 's largest city and the most authoritative voice on national news . Seen as a national tower of rectitude , the Times has always enjoyed universal respect for its even-handed impartiality . So it 's not surprising that the impact of this Times propaganda offensive was far more widespread than its daily circulation of 1.1 million would suggest . Not only do most opinion leaders in America read the newspaper itself , but the New York Times News Service  --  the paper 's equivalent of the Associated Press @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country . In addition , its stories are reprinted in the International Herald Tribune and disseminated in every major city in the world , and , of course , are available on the Internet. // Beyond the nominal reach of the paper and its wire service , however , the themes set in the New York Times are crucial in shaping trends in journalism throughout almost every paper in the nation . During my time in the Clinton White House , I tracked carefully the themes that were covered on the front pages of twenty newspapers in swing states throughout the nation . Each week my staff detailed the topics covered in such diverse dailies as the Cleveland Plain Dealer , Chicago Tribune , St. Louis Post-Dispatch , San Francisco Examiner , Miami Herald , and other pivotal papers in key states . In addition , we evaluated the number of minutes each of the three networks devoted to each news topic . // That ongoing survey revealed just how closely the themes covered in print and on TV tracked those first articulated on the front page of the New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to flow out from the initial news splash it made , touching scores of other , more local , news organs . //
