Tony Gwynn , eight-time National League battingtitlewinner , suffered 20 years of baseball damage to his knees , causing pain and lack of mobility . Mary , a 62 year-old grandmother of three , could hardly climb the stairs in her home , and Sarah , mom to a toddler could n't open jars anymore or lift her baby due to the pain of their arthritis . That was then . Now each of them has found relief from pain and inflammation with a research backed , natural anti-inflammatory called Celadrin . Arthritis ( " arth " meaning joint ; " itis " meaning inflammation ) consists of over 100 different conditions , from osteoarthritis the most common form to gout and lupus . Inflammation , swelling and , most importantly , pain are hallmarks of arthritis . Pain relief is what arthritics seek , but many people are especially troubled by the side effects associated with over-the-counter and prescription drugs to control pain and inflammation . Acetaminophen taken in higher than recommended doses is the leading cause of acute liver failure and causes 10 percent of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical journal shows that NSAIDS can cause hip joint destruction . Other research has shown NSAIDS to cause bone repair problems . Vioxx and Bextra have been removed from the market due to an increased risk of heart attack and/or stroke , and Celebrex may not be far behind . Celadrin Brings Relief Results of a double-blind , multi-center , placebo-controlled trial ( the most scientifically validated type ) published in the prestigious Journal of Rheumatology found that Celadrin , when taken orally , improved joint and mobility problems . Sixty-four participants between the ages of 37 and 77 were given Celadrin capsules . They were evaluated at the beginning , at 30 days and at the end of the 68-day study . Compared to those given a placebo , participants taking Celadrin had more flexibility , fewer aches , less pain , and were able to walk longer distances than the placebo group . Pain Stopping Cream Research on the effectiveness of Celadrin cream performed at the University of Connecticut involved 42 patients with osteoarthritis of the knee . Participants received either Celadrin ( with no menthol ) applied topically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cream , 30 minutes after , and then again following a 30-day treatment period during which the cream was applied twice a day , morning and evening . The researchers evaluated physical function , postural sway , pain , and range of motion . Testing of physical function included a timed assessment of how long it took to get up and go from a chair , stair climbing , muscle strength and endurance , and mobility of the knee . The group receiving Celadrin showed outstanding results , with reduced pain and stiffness , improved balance and strength , and better mobility . What was most exciting was that within 30 minutes of applying Celadrin cream , patients experienced a dramatic improvement in all aspects tested . No change in the placebo group was found . Results of this study were published in The journal of Rheumatology in August 2002 . Another study , published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning* in May 2005 , under the direction of Dr. Kraemer at the Human Performance Laboratory at the University of Connecticut using Celadrin cream in individuals with arthritis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kraemer wanted to verify that the addition of menthol to the Celadrin cream would produce a similar percentage of improvement in therapeutic effects . One week of treatment with a topical cream consisting of Celadrin and menthol was similarly effective for reducing pain and improving functional performance in individuals with arthritis of the knee , elbow , and wrist They then performed another study , published in the Journal of Strength and Conditionings February 2005 , under the direction of Dr. Kraemer that examined the effects of 30 days of treatment with Celadrin cream ( again , with no menthol ) on the ability to stand and move and put pressure on the feet in patients with osteoarthritis ( OA ) of one or both knees . Forty patients diagnosed with knee OA were randomly assigned to receive Celadrin cream or a placebo . Assessments included 20- and 40-second quiet standing on a force plate to measure center of pressure , and rear foot and forefoot plantar pressure distribution . This study showed that 30 days of treatment with Celadrin topical cream improves static postural stability in patients with knee OA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Celadrin is helpful in improving the exercise trainability of people with OA . Those using the oral form of Celadrin and the cream together experienced a much faster improvement in pain , swelling and mobility than those using the cream alone . Celadrin is not only effective , but it is safe to take with your prescription medications as no drug-nutrient interactions have been found . Tony , Mary and Sarah will no longer be suffering with pain and lack of mobility any longer . Mary said it best : " I used to know I had hips and knees because the pain was so excruciating just to do simple things like get up from a chair . Now I move and forget that my joints are there . I dance and move like I did 40 years ago .
