following advice she had given a reader from Petaluma , Texas , in one of her recent columns . " We should all wear bonnets , " she said to the three men sitting next to her at the bar , " and walk up and down this block . " She waved her arm sloppily toward the street outside . It was six o'clock , well into happy hour , and Linda was quite a bit drunk . <p> Linda was often drunk . She lived in a drafty old house two blocks from her bar , Lucy 's , with a black cat who bit people . " Nice kitty , " she would say to the cat , whose name was Walter . <p> All day Linda sat in her house at a desk littered with Post-it notes , sipping from half-drunk cups of cold coffee , dispensing tidy advice to troubled souls she 'd never met . " You are much better off being alone than with someone who makes you miserable , " she told the adolescent readers of Sugar and Spice ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that makes you jealous , make a joke out of it , " she told the slightly older readers of Woman Today ( 2 million subscribers , including dentists ) . " Do n't cause a scene or tell him you want to have a talk . Men hate to hear that they have to have a talk . " <p> Linda herself could happily talk a man 's ear off and had once been asked to leave Lucy 's after she called another woman a dirty shitfly . Still , she had high hopes for her readers , whom she imagined to be flat-faced and open-mouthed , insatiable as baby starlings . Her columns were very popular , and she made a lot of money writing them . <p> The advice she had given Petaluma , of course , had nothing to do with bonnets , but rather with useful ways to distract oneself from a broken heart . <p> " Dear Ms. Hartley , " Petaluma had written . " I just broke up with my boyfriend of a year . I know it was the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he drinks a lot . I know these are bad things , and I knew that if I loved myself I 'd have to leave him . But all I do is want him back . Maybe I was too cold the last time , and I could make it better this time . Maybe I should call him . Do you think I should call him ? Please Help . " <p> " I 'm sorry , but I 'd have to say no calling , " Linda had advised . " If you think he cheated on you , he probably did . Stay busy . Start a special project , like gardening or wine tasting . Or try a fitness class , like African dance ! Once you develop your own interests , you might find it easier to let him go . After all , there are plenty of fish in the sea . " <p> Linda knew this was true , in general , although herself she was still stuck on one particular fish , a vegetable farmer named Tiny . In the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for beans and cabbages , carefully feeding them with water and nitrogenized dirt , and pulling bugs off their leaves and stems with his own huge hands . After a day of driving tractors , tending corn , and building towers from dirt for the potatoes to grow in , he came to Lucy 's for seven to fifteen Budweisers . Sometimes he got mad and started a fight , and other times , if the music was right , he 'd get loose and charming . Then Tiny would start to dance . <p> That 's how Linda fell in love with him . One night in late May , when the cherry trees bloomed hopefully under the moon , she stuck her hips to his and just danced , a half-smoked cigarette dangling from her fingertips , until two in the morning . <p> They danced pretty well together , if you asked her . They danced in bars , outside in the park , and one night after they drank two bottles of whiskey , they danced naked in her big drafty house , two drunk fools knocking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It was n't until the wheat fields turned purple and summer began to die that Linda noticed how many things Tiny broke when he danced . In September he fell into a table at Lucy 's and broke four wineglasses . In October he broke a pitcher of beer , a candy dish , and two pint glasses . At her Christmas party in December he danced on her cat and almost broke Walter 's tail . Linda suggested that he dance before drinking ten bottles of Budweiser and a half a bottle of whiskey , and he advised her not to nag . Then in February , while the wheat seeds slept peacefully beneath the snow , Tiny danced a mambo with a pretty girl who liked to drink even more than he did , and broke the columnist 's restless , lonely heart . <p> " Goddammit , " said Linda , and told him it was over . After all , she , of all people , knew that a successful thirty-two-year-old woman should not have to put up with that kind of nonsense . But then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , and she let him in . And when he said he loved her , not the other girl , she was so relieved she took off all her clothes . " We 're not back together , though , " she said firmly the next morning . " Not until you stop drinking . " <p> " You 're so pretty , " Tiny said , and Linda let him stay over the next night , too . <p> Earlier in the week , before Good Friday , Tiny had called her to see if she 'd go to his family 's house with him for Easter . " No , " Linda said . " We are broken up , " she said , even though she wanted , more than anything , to get into the car and drive for miles with him , with his hand on her leg , the way they 'd driven all summer back when things were good and she had n't cared about his yeasty-smelling feet , or how porous his skin was for a twenty-seven-year-old boy . " I ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that if she did , she 'd have to lie to her therapist . Again . " Anyway , it 's over , " she told herself , after Tiny hung up the phone . <p> Now it was Good Friday and a good day for listening to good advice . Tiny had gone to his family 's house without her , and Linda told herself she 'd done the right thing . Keep yourself busy , she 'd reminded herself as she walked briskly to the bar . ( " Always walk as if you are five minutes late for an appointment , " she advised her readers . " You burn extra calories , and exude confidence ! " ) There are plenty of fish in the sea . <p> " I 'm serious , " she said to Benny Jackson , one of the happy hour regulars . " We should make our own bonnets and have an Easter parade . " <p> Benny wiped the foam from his third Guinness off of his shaggy mustache . He was a tall , thick man with a handsome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearsighted and one was farsighted , which made him fairly good at darts but not so good at walking straight , or , for that matter , driving . As a drunk , Linda once told him , Benny was perfect . Almost a natural . <p> " A parade , " he bellowed . He was deaf in his right ear and nearly always yelled . <p> " We could start a tradition , " Linda said . <p> " Where the hell am I going to get a bonnet ? " <p> " You have to make it , " Linda said . <p> " I do n't know , " Benny said . " I may have to do my taxes on Sunday . " <p> " Oh , bullshit , " said Linda , losing patience . " Do them tomorrow . The parade will be at five-thirty , " she decided , " which leaves you all day to make your bonnet . You 'll do it , " she went on . " Come on , I know you will . " <p> Linda thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been drinking with him for more than a year . She knew , for example , that he was a kind man and a fair man , and not a person in the bar would say otherwise . She knew , from the time she bet him that since he was asthmatic and tone-deaf he would n't have the guts to belt out " White Wedding " at a karaoke contest , that he rose to almost any challenge . She knew , because he 'd told her , that Benny was divorced , and that he had an eight-year-old daughter who was sending anonymous notes to her teacher that started with " Dear Stupid . " She knew , because she drank with him , that he consumed a six-pack of beer and up to six shots of Southern Comfort a night , unless he had custody of his daughter , when he did n't touch a drop , no matter how much the withdrawal made his hands shudder . <p> " I 'll tell you what , " Benny said . " If you can get Stewie Levine to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fishing hat and be in the parade . " <p> Stewart was standing at the end of the bar , well into his second pitcher . He was an ex  --  marine who lived with his mother . He kept his hair short-actually , he was bald  --  and although the three pitchers a day he drank had widened his belly , he stretched his old T-shirts neatly over it and tucked them into his jeans , which he always bought too long and rolled up , as if he might still grow a few inches . <p> " Oh , Stew , be in the Easter parade , " said Linda . <p> Stewart looked at her with gray , soggy eyes . <p> " What , baby ? " he said . <p> " I think we should all make bonnets and parade to the Tick , " she said . Linda knew that the Tick Tock Saloon was one of Stewart 's favorite bars , and she waved the idea in front of him like a nice piece of ass . The Tick sat two blocks away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college students stunk up Lucy 's with cologne and clove cigarettes , the regulars would trickle over there in a thin , wobbly line , like worker ants coming back from feasting on the queen 's nectar . They 'd keep drinking and play pool until three or four in the morning . Sometimes they danced or cried , and occasionally they engaged in oral sex in the sixty-five-year-old bathrooms . Linda loved the Tick Tock as much as Stewart did . She herself had wept and danced and would have engaged in oral sex in the bathroom , but at the time Tiny had been too drunk to stand , so they sat on the toilet and shared a few slobbery kisses until Stewart pounded on the door and threatened to kill whoever was in there with his bare hands . <p> " We 'll drink whiskey at the Tick , " she went on , " and parade back home to Lucy 's . " <p> Stewart looked at her red-lipsticked lips and heaved a long , very sad sigh . " I do n't have a bonnet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your own , " she replied . " Those are the rules . " <p> " Aww , go to hell , " Stewart said , and followed his barrel belly outside to lie down . <p> Hank Stevens snorted and said he would wear a bathing cap with daisies on it , and Ruby Caine , who was so pretty Hank could n't stand next to her , said she was going to wear a straw hat loaded with lilacs and edible fruit . She said this with an elegant sweep of her bony arm and carried her drink to the other end of the bar . <p> " She 's so fucking beautiful , " Hank sighed . " Is n't she beautiful ? " <p> " She 's a beauty , all right , " said Benny . <p> " Beauty , " frowned the columnist , who might have been beautiful herself if it were n't for a slight overbite , " is only skin-deep . " <p> Linda had recruited six people to join the parade by the time she wandered back to her house . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lesbian bartender who always fell in love with women but liked to sleep with men ) , and Harlin Wilder , provided he was still out on bail . Harlin had recently been arrested because someone in his apartment had ordered a box of chicken wings to be delivered , and then grabbed the food and refused to pay , spewing so much foul language that the delivery girl called the police . Four people , including Harlin , were pepper-sprayed as a result of this petty crime , and three people , including Harlin , spent the night in jail . <p> " It was my roommate , not me , that did it , " Harlin had told Linda . " I 've been trying to stay away from trouble . " <p> " I know , Harlin , " she 'd said . " But maybe you should stop living with your brother . " <p> Linda was in the bathtub the next morning , sipping some coffee and nursing a terrible headache , when she heard her permanently disappointed neighbor plod heavily to her door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself off and went out to investigate . Beneath the mail slot was a misdelivered pack of letters , forwarded from one of the magazines in which her columns appeared . Attached to the pack was a handwritten note that said , " If you do n't keep that goddamn cat of yours in your own apartment , I 'm going to yank its little head off . Love , thy neighbor . ( Ha Ha . ) " <p> The columnist gave the note to the cat to eat and opened the first letter , which was from Petaluma . <p> " Dear Ms. Hartley , Thank you for answering my letter in your column , " Petaluma wrote in small curly letters . " I liked your advice . I joined a book club , I signed up for some art lessons , and I even bought a Thighmaster and a fitness tape to do whenever I think of calling my ex-boyfriend . I started to feel a little bit better , but then the other day I saw him with another woman . The thing is , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fat . I know I should love myself , and most days I do , but then I see them together and my legs feel like thick , barky tree trunks . I know he 's probably a cheater , and I deserve better . But I do n't think I should ever have let him go , Ms. Hartley . I 'm a full-figured extra-sized girl who does n't get a lot of attention in this society . I read where you wrote once that you went out with a bad guy , and he was sexy and everything , and then you found a nice guy , and it was much better . But you were lucky . I guess I ca n't find a nice guy no matter how hard I try . I just hate being alone , " Petaluma wrote on . " It 's terrible to be alone . " <p> " Oh , Petaluma , " Linda said , and picked up a pen . <p> " It is hard to be alone , " she wrote back gently . " But it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the way you deserve . Make a list of things you like about yourself , " she wrote . " Keep the list and recite it to yourself every time you see him with this woman . " <p> Linda bit her pen and hoped that would work . A therapist had given her this trick after she broke up with Liam , the man she 'd loved before Tiny . When Liam broke up with Linda to get back together with his old girlfriend , Linda had made up a list of things she liked about herself in case she ever ran into them . " I have very strong legs , " she had written . " I can sing . I have great skin for a woman over thirty . I can read maps . I have never been in jail . " But she never had to use her list , because she 'd left Manhattan , where Liam and his girlfriend lived , and moved upstate to her drafty house near Lucy 's . <p> " It is not a question of him finding someone better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is a question of people being suitable for one another . He is not suitable for you , and you are not suitable for him . You will find someone who is much better , do n't worry . In the meantime , use that list . " <p> She looked at her words . " Right , Walter ? " she said out loud . " It 's not rejection , it 's suitability . Just like Tiny is not suitable for me , and I am not suitable for him . " Walter tilted his head and looked hungrily at her thumb . " No , sweetie pie , " she said , pulling him up on her lap . " No biting . " <p> She put Petaluma 's letter aside and picked up the next one in the packet . <p> " My boyfriend and I were dry-humping on the couch and his penis got inside my vagina . Could I be pregnat ? Love , Wondering . P.S. Dry-humping is when you go through the motions of doing it , but you keep all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear , confused Wondering , " Linda sighed , and stuck a Post-it note to the top of Wondering 's letter . " Thx for clarification , " she wrote . " Explain pre-ejaculatory fluids . " <p> She paused for a moment and looked out the window . " Although , really , thanks for nothing , " she said to the cat . " I mean , what makes her think I do n't know about dry-humping ? I could dry-hump my way through Cuba if I felt like it . She ca n't even spell pregnant . " <p> Walter chewed happily on a spider . Linda added a splash of bourbon to her coffee . <p> The next letter was from a woman in Knoxville who was upset with her fiance . " He says I hold my knife and fork like a child ! ! " Knoxville wrote . " I am certainly willing to take criticism , and I know marriage is all about compromise . Still , I do n't think ' You hold your cutlery like an infant ' is a nice thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be concerned , " Linda wrote . " Do n't marry him . " She looked at her words and pulled off another Post-it . " Make a list of things you do n't like about him , " she wrote , and stuck it to the top of Petaluma 's letter . <p> Linda decided that she 'd done enough work for a Saturday morning and that it was time to focus on her parade . In the back of her closet she found a sombrero she 'd won at Lucy 's on Valentine 's Day for kissing Rita on the lips . It was orange and had a turquoise band around it that said " La Cuervoracha ! ! " Fine , she thought , and left the house to find some decorations . <p> At the dollar store she bought four fake red lilies the size of soup bowls , a basket of plastic grapes , bananas , and apples , and some polyester yellow roses . In the gardening section of the hardware store , she found a battery-powered bluebird that sang " Toowhee ! Toowhee ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she ran into Benny , who was on his crooked way to the bar . <p> " I thought you were working on your taxes today , " Linda said . <p> " I did n't say I 'd be in that parade , " Benny said , eyeing the red lilies sticking out of the top of one of her bags . " I did n't say I would n't , but I did n't say I would , either . " <p> " I think you should buy me a drink , " Linda said , and followed him into the bar . <p> Stewart and Harlin were already there , swapping cop encounter stories . Stewart had just gotten arrested for pulling a shotgun on his own son . <p> " You ever seen my kid ? " Stewart was saying . " You 'd pull a gun on him , too , if that monster came running at you . " <p> " I might , " said Harlin . " But I 'm not a big guy . You , on the other hand , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . <p> Benny bought Linda a shot of tequila , and Harlin moved over one stool so she could sit down . <p> " Linda Hartley , " Harlin said . He raised a half-drunk bottle of Schaeffer . " Miss Lonely Hartley , " he went on . " Linda , I 'd like to buy you a drink , " he said . <p> " How 's your girlfriend , Harlin ? " Linda said , trying not to pay attention to the thick gray chest hair that pushed its way out of the white shirt Harlin wore for pot-washing at Hank 's Corner Diner next door . <p> " My girlfriend 's fine . " <p> " We 're all fine , " said Benny , and Linda raised her glass to him . <p> Harlin grinned , revealing a set of remarkably small yellow teeth . " How 's your bonnet , Linda ? " he said . <p> Linda shoved her bag at him . " In the works , Harlin . " <p> Harlin shook his head . " That 's a goddamn crazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes , " Linda smiled , " but at least I have ideas . " <p> " Harlin 's got ideas , " said Stewart . " Stealing chicken wings from a delivery girl is n't a bad idea . " <p> " Unless you end up in jail , " said Benny . <p> " Now listen , you two . Harlin says he did n't do that , " Linda said . <p> " Let me ask you something , Linda , " Harlin said . " Why wo n't you let me buy you a drink ? " <p> " I have a drink . " <p> " You do have a drink . But even if you did n't have a drink , you still would n't let me buy you one . " <p> " Someday you can buy me a drink . " <p> " Naw , " Harlin went on . " You know what I mean , Benny ? I mean , here 's an intelligent , good-looking woman right here sitting next to us . And for months she goes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 're broken up , " Linda said . <p> " And I ca n't even buy her a drink . " <p> " I would n't call him the biggest lowlife in town , " Linda went on . <p> " I 'd call him the Tiny-est , " said Benny , and Linda raised her glass to him again <p> " And she sips her tequila , " Harlin said . " I mean , look at that . The fucking stuff tastes like turpentine , only she sips it like she 's at some little-girl tea party . ' Well , hello , Mr. Bear and Mr. Rabbit , ' " he singsonged , strangling his beer with his thumb and forefinger and sticking a thick pinkie up in the air . " ' Would you like a tiny taste of tequila ? ' " <p> Benny said nothing , but he repositioned himself to the side of Linda so that he was almost between her and Harlin . It was a protective move , and Linda leaned toward him slightly to let him know she noticed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she shrugged . <p> " That makes her more of a man than you , " Stewart said , pointing at Harlin 's Schaeffer . <p> " What is it about that guy ? " Harlin pulled out a cigarette and lit it with fingers that were chafed and red from working in hot soapy water . " The women around here ca n't get enough of him . " <p> Linda waved the smoke away from her face and wrapped her napkin around the base of her shot glass . The women around here , she thought . What women ? She was about to ask Harlin what he was talking about , but when she looked up at him he was staring at her narrowly , and she decided on another approach . <p> " Harlin , " she said , as if she were trying to soothe a hyperactive third-grader , " remember Cadence ? We all knew Cadence was no good . Every time you came in here you were mad at her . Remember how she drove your new truck to Phillips County when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tucked into her bra ? " <p> Harlin pulled a plastic sword out of the garnish tray on the bar and carefully cleaned the space between his two little front teeth . <p> " And remember the night you caught her making out with your friend Paul and you got so mad you smashed his head into Windner 's Bridge but he got back up and almost killed you ? " <p> " I remember that , " said Benny . " He was a little guy , too . " <p> " He was so coked up he bounced back three times , " said Harlin . " I 've never seen anything like it . He knocked me down twice before he finally collapsed . " <p> They all sat still for a minute , giving Paul 's addiction a moment of silence . Then Linda continued . <p> " I bet every time you saw Cadence you knew somewhere that the whole thing between you two was doomed , " she said . " And I bet that made your heart ache so much you did n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that every second with her made you feel like you were on fire . " Linda made a helpless gesture with her hands , and Harlin put his plastic sword down . <p> " That 's what it was like with me and Tiny , " she said . <p> Harlin stared at her hard for a minute , as if seeing her with a new pair of eyes . Then he shrugged and went back to his drink . <p> " Well , I knew it was something , " he said . " I mean , the women around here ca n't get enough of him . " <p> Linda had heard the comment the first time , and for a second imagined shoving a big red lily up Harlin 's ass . <p> " Actually , " she said , " I 'm just kidding . The truth is , Tiny 's really hot in bed . " <p> " Aw , fuck you , Hartley , " Harlin said . <p> " See that ? " Linda said . " You see that ? That is exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Harlin glared at her and put a dollar down on the bar . He finished his beer and walked out . <p> Linda ordered another tequila and drank it while Benny stayed next to her , watching Stewart try to beat himself at darts . <p> " The thing is , " Linda said after a while , " people do n't really want good advice . Good advice is : Eat bananas . Use a condom . Break up with the beautiful , terrible woman who will never love you . Bad advice is : Have three martinis every day . Sleep with your ex-boyfriend . Go look for a husband in a bar . " <p> " That 's the good stuff , " said Benny , pulling a cigarette out of a pack someone had left on the bar . His hands quivered slightly as he did this , and Linda wondered how his daughter was . She watched him pull a cloud of unfiltered smoke into his asthmatic lungs , and it occurred to her , not for the first time , that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , she 'd never seen Benny with a woman , period , except Rita , maybe , or herself . <p> " Benny , let me ask you something , " she said . Benny nodded , his eyes still on Stewart , who was muttering vague threats at the side of himself that was winning . <p> " Are you still in love with your ex-wife ? " <p> Benny did n't look at her , and the question hung there in the thick air between them . It sat there for so long that Linda had to double-check and make sure she was n't sitting next to his deaf ear . <p> " That 's really not your business , " he finally said . <p> It was the first time he had refused her anything , so Linda did not say what she thought , which was that it was her business . In fact , other people 's sadness was exactly what her business was . Only really , what could she do about it ? She could hardly live with her own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on his arm , " do n't mind me . " She gathered up her bags and paid for her drink . " I 'm just drunk , " she said , and made her way home . <p> That night Linda sat alone in her drafty house , sewing flowers , plastic fruit , and ribbons onto her sombrero . There were no drunken messages from Tiny on her machine when she got home , and the phone did n't ring at one , two , or three in the morning . Stay busy , she reminded herself firmly . There are plenty of fish in the sea . <p> The morning of the Easter parade , Linda decided to make a few calls to remind people that it was happening . By noon it was not going well . Rita 's girlfriend had found out about a one-night stand she had had with a man , and they were involved in an all-day fight . Hank Stevens had no idea what fool business she was talking about , but anyway , he had to work . Ruby had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ low profile . No one will come to my parade , sighed Linda . She thought about calling Stewart , but it made her nervous . She thought about calling Harlin , but she was still a little annoyed with him from the day before . She thought about calling her therapist but decided to fix herself a vodka tonic instead . That one tasted good , so she had a few more . <p> At five-thirty , the estimated time of the parade , Linda was feeling much better . She added some finishing touches to her bonnet and then stepped back to admire her work . La Cuervoracha ! ! was transformed . Plastic apples , bananas , and the huge red lilies covered its brim . In the middle of the front , perched on top of an obscene pile of grapes , was the fake bluebird , ready at the slightest touch to sing . <p> " This , " she told Walter , " is one hell of a bonnet . " <p> She put on a pink dress and some high heels and , balancing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucy 's as if she were five minutes late . I look good , she thought as she caught her reflection in the plate glass windows of Hank 's Corner Diner . " I am the queen of the Easter parade , " she announced to herself . She caught Hank staring at her from the inside of the restaurant and waved . <p> " Jesus Christ , look at that , " Hank said . " It looks like someone vomited up Easter on that woman 's head . " He waved back . <p> Lucy 's was practically empty when Linda entered , and for an instant the vodka gave her a terrible dose of clarity . She was the Easter parade . One drunk woman on a Sunday afternoon wearing a sombrero . With a bird on it . <p> But then as her eyes adjusted to Lucy 's dim interior , she noticed three gray figures clustered at the end of the bar by the television . Benny , Harlin , and Stewart were on their second round . Benny was holding a pinata , a three-tiered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open beak and astonished green eyes , and it would add a good two feet to Benny 's already substantial height . Hank had loaned him a box of toothpicks from the diner , and Benny was busy sticking pink marshmallow rabbits on top of the thing 's head . When he saw her , Benny held it up to the one intrepid piece of sun that pushed its way through a dirty window above the bathroom door . <p> " Benny , it 's fantastic , " breathed Linda , thinking she might cry . <p> " I had to borrow my friend Rusty 's jabber saw to make it fit on my head , " Benny yelled . <p> Next to Benny , Harlin Wilder was also stabbing marshmallow rabbits with toothpicks , which he then stuck to a black fedora through which two pink rabbit ears poked . " I am Peter Cocktail , " he said grandly , and the columnist kissed him full on the mouth . Stewart , who was sitting next to Harlin , demanded a kiss himself . He was wearing a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his helmet he had pasted a piece of paper that said " My bonnet , love it or leave it . " <p> " Stewart , it 's beautiful , " she said , patting his shoulder . She looked in the mirror to check her own bonnet and in its reflection saw Tiny , standing near the dartboard , wearing a faded green T-shirt that made his eyes bluer than the sea . <p> Tiny smiled and waved , and Linda smiled back , taking a step toward him . As she did , the pretty mambo queen came out of the bathroom and made her way toward the empty stool next to Tiny . Linda stopped smiling and backed up , bumping into an inflatable parrot that hung from the ceiling from last year 's Cinco de Mayo celebration . " Toowhee ! Toowhee ! " shrieked her bluebird . The mambo queen said something to Tiny , and Linda began to recite her list of things she liked about herself . I can read maps , she thought . I have a widely published , reputable column . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high cheekbone , and Linda watched as his hand snaked around her waist . I can sing , she thought . I can run four miles without stopping on very strong legs . A plastic banana dropped from her bonnet . <p> " I can get out of this goddamn bar , " she said out loud , and turned to the three old men . " Well , boys , " she announced , " let the parade begin . " <p> The columnist linked arms with Stewart , Benny , and Harlin , and they marched down the block . " Nice hats , " said Fat Betty the meter maid . <p> " Are those . . . bonnets ? " asked a hippie . <p> " We 're the Easter parade ! " bellowed Benny , clocking Linda on the head . <p> " Toowhee ! Toowhee ! " sang her bird . <p> At the Tick Tock , Linda bought Benny and Stewart bourbon and let Harlin buy her a shot of tequila . Harlin saw his parole officer . " I know you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , " but I did n't steal the chicken wings . My roommate , Martin , was the one that did it . I was in bed when it happened .

Harlin clapped him on the back and went to the bathroom . <p> " Why the hell not , " the parole officer continued to Linda . " I believe all of them . Every time . And you know what ? Every time they fucking lie to me . " <p> Stewart ordered himself a pitcher and elbowed his way to the pool table . <p> " Nice hat , " said Big Dave the hustler . <p> " Eat me , " growled Stewart , and Dave let him break . <p> Linda sat at the bar next to the parole officer and ordered double bourbon . She had given up thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men who might love her . " That Liam , he loved me , " she said . " Bill Stevens loved me for ten years even though I only kissed him once .

" She swatted at a bunch of grapes that had come loose and were drooping over her ear . <p> " I love you , sweetheart , " said the bartender , who was secretly gay . He gave her her bourbon and patted her hand . " We all love you . Really , we do . " <p> Linda gave up on her bonnet and placed it gently on the bar . She sipped her drink and watched Benny picking out music at the jukebox , his heavy chest laboring to pull oxygen into his weary lungs . <p> Benny saw her staring and offered her a trembling hand . " Put on your bonnet , Ms. Hartley , " he said . " They 're playing our song . " <p> Linda gazed up at his drooping mustache and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Benny burped , and his overexcited bonnet wobbled a little . She saw that on one of the bonnet 's outstretched wings Benny had stuck a tag that said " Hello , my name is Benford . " Benny , she thought . Benny loves me . <p> She imagined that over at Lucy 's , Tiny was finishing his fifth or sixth beer . He would be starting to move now , getting ready to twirl and spin the other girl , until she felt light and important as a late spring . She thought of short , extra-full-figured Petaluma squeezing the hell out of her Thighmaster and wishing the phone would ring . Oh , love him , Petaluma , she thought . Love him . <p> She put on her bonnet and took Benny 's arm . They walked to the jukebox , which was playing a Willie Nelson version of " Waltz Across Texas . " Benny put his thick arms around her , and she pressed her younger body full-length against his . She pressed into him , and he pressed back , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the songs switched to a faster rhythm , they stayed that way , two flowers drifting in the bar 's smoky haze , dancing as if they 'd been in love for a hundred years . <p> <p> By Rebecca Barry <p>
