I THOUGHT I KNEW HOW I FELT ABOUT HUNTING . I WAS ON AN EARLY-SEASON deer hunt in western Kentucky this year when I ran into a guy I had n't seen in a long time : me . I was hunting with a couple of " industry " guys who figured they could count the trip as work if they invited me . It was late September , only nobody had told the weather . You 'd wake up at 4:30 and it was in the mid 80s . By afternoon , it was 100 . We were hunting feeders , usually not my idea of a fair fight . But everybody said it was the only way to see a deer . A months-long drought had scorched the food plots , a late-spring freeze had killed off the mast , and every step you took in the woods cracked like a rifle shot . If there was ever an unlikely place and time for a surprise encounter , this was it . By the third afternoon , tired of being carpooled to and from my stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by walking the roads , a parched little food plot half a mile from the lodge . The corn was long gone , but there were fresh droppings , some of which looked big enough to have been left by a buck . A ladder stand commanded the spot , but another hunter told me it caught full sun and was like sitting in a Dutch oven . I scrounged an old climber and lugged it with me that afternoon . By the time I reached 18 feet , my shirt was shredded , my forearms were bleeding ( short sleeves and hug-the-tree climbers are not a good combination ) , and I was dribbling a steady stream of sweat onto the ground . I opened my spray bottle of Scent Killer and slowly emptied it onto my head and over the rest of my body . Two hours later , three does and three fawns came tiptoeing out of the pines . They were taut as guitar strings , coming and bolting four times , spooked by the twigs breaking under their own hooves . Finally they started feeding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needles at the base of my tree . She caught a whiff of something wrong and started swinging her head around , trying to locate the source . The one place she failed to look was straight up . The encounter got my heart redlining . I shut my eyes , pressed my forehead into the bark , and shrunk the world down until it consisted of the pounding in my ears and my new task in life : inhaling for four beats and exhaling for eight . Long minutes later , I picked out the biggest doe and began a slow pivot . When she turned broadside I drew , aimed , and let the arrow go . All six deer were within touching distance of one another , and at the shot each exploded on an arc unique to itself . It was like a fireworks shell you could see but not hear . I saw my arrow hit low , saw the red blood bloom on her coat as she leaped . I must have nicked her heart because she died in midair . I 'd never seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air fully animated and came back to earth inert . We 'd been encouraged to shoot does to maintain the land 's carrying capacity and the ratio between the sexes . And yet , I felt uneasy as I walked toward the deer . I knelt , stroked her neck , and apologized for having taken her life . Then I made my first cut . As I worked , a feeling of regret kept dogging me . It was as if it had been decades rather than months since I 'd last done this . I looked at her muscled heart and the dark liver as if seeing these organs for the first time , heard the sloshing of blood in the now-empty body . It was unnerving . Something , it seemed , had changed in me . The bungee cords holding me to this particular place and time went slack . I was no longer the guy on the licenses and ID cards in my wallet . Suddenly , I was nothing more or less than a lone man in unfamiliar country in the almost-dark , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd just taken . I flashed on the first buck I had killed with a bow , the euphoria of mastery , of besting a wild thing at its own game . I 'd dipped a toe into the river that day , been initiated into the mystery and knowledge that all life feeds on other life . It had been both wonderful and terrible , humbling and pride inducing . I remembered being immensely relieved to discover that it had n't been wrong to kill . But I was no longer that young hunter , the one with more years in front of him than behind . I 'd changed , and so had my experience of hunting . I understood in my bones what I 'd only understood in the abstract until now : that just as I had hunted and taken this deer , so was something just outside my awareness stalking me . My arc on this earth would end as irrevocably as the deer 's had . And there was n't a damn thing to be done until that day except to live as fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't been wrong to kill this deer . I still loved hunting . It was hunting , after all , that had helped me make sense of my true circumstances . But I had to admit that , like life , hunting was turning out to be a lot more complicated than I 'd thought . PULLQUOTE Suddenly , I was just a man standing over an animal whose life he 'd taken . BOX Heavey in Hardcover : Bill Heavey 's If You Did n't Bring Jerky , What Did I Just Eat ?
