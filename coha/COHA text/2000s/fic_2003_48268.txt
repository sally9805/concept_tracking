1 . Topsy , needy <p> This is about an elephant , electrocuted one hundred years ago . Her name was Topsy , and she was famous at a time when people were still amazed by an elephant . Plus she did tricks . She could stand on her back legs , raising her front legs , wearing a gauze tutu . She was a star attraction at Coney Island , and because of her fame she had her own trainer , a man named Gus , who fed her , bathed her , cleaned her stall , and naturally a bond was formed between them . Love , you could call it . Gus knew that love was essential in the training of animals , and so he encouraged that love . He gave her bananas when she was good as a way to reinforce their affection . He also had a stick , which he used , but because for Topsy the connection they had was paramount , she loved him for the bananas and forgave him for the stick . <p> When she got older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Other , more important animals required his attention so that by 1900 she was mainly used for heavy labor . He had n't exactly rejected her-he would still leave her some food-but he did n't bathe her , he did n't comfort her , and he certainly did n't return her love . That was what she wanted ; that was what she was used to . When a person gets used to a thing and then that thing is taken away , the person becomes destabilized , and in that state it 's not too hard to go a little crazy . Topsy did n't go crazy , but she was hurt and she was sad . And she could n't talk about it . She did n't have the language . <p> She could think and feel , but she could n't express herself because the language inside of her was elephant language , plus it was inside of her . And so , unable to communicate her thoughts and emotions , she started acting out . She was frustrated by her inability to affect her environment , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember so well because their experiences are stored in their bodies , and they have big bodies , and her big body was filled with unpleasant thoughts and emotions . She tried to banish these thoughts and emotions , but she could n't . She could n't deny them or ignore them because she was filled with them , literally . <p> One day after work , two of Gus 's friends stopped by . They 'd been drinking , and they were playing around , teasing Topsy , and one of them , as a joke , threw a lighted cigarette into her mouth . Because of the structure of the elephant mouth she could n't spit it out ; it continued to burn , like a fuse , until suddenly something exploded in her . From her face alone you would n't know . She looked calm and peaceful . From her big , sleepy eyes you would n't sense the rage , and she did n't know her own rage , and when she turned , she was n't aware of any particular desire to kill . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of whom was standing against the main support post . But she grabbed the man with her trunk , lifted him up , threw him against the post , and there was nothing except the sound of the snapping of bones . A scream , maybe , because Gus , who 'd been outside the tent , came into the tent . The other man , the one who threw the cigarette , was on the ground underneath her foot , and partly out of anger and partly out of her desire to communicate her unhappiness to Gus , she raised her foot over the man 's face , and then she let her foot come down . <p> First the man screamed , and then the foot came down . And then his head collapsed , mixing in with the hay and the dung . Gus , over by the tent flap , was just watching , silhouetted against the light . The first man , still alive , limped away to the edge of the tent , and it was n't just the cigarette , Topsy knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wanted Gus to know what she was feeling . There was no recognition on his face , but she was hoping . Even as she was surrounded by men with sharp poles she watched Gus to see if he knew what he 'd caused . As she was led away in chains she kept looking back to see if now , finally , he understood . <p> There was a silent film made of Topsy 's death . It was a one-minute short , produced by Thomas Edison 's manufacturing company . The camera was there , part of the semicircle of fifteen hundred spectators at the new Luna Park , on January 4th . Topsy was standing , surrounded by people . The cameras started rolling . And then the six thousand volts of this new invention called electricity were sent into the elephant 's body . At first nothing happened , then the quivering , then the throes . The smoke rising out of the bottom of her feet . The film captures the muscles of the elephant going limp and lifeless , the elephant remaining upright after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the huge beast collapses into the dust . The whole event took about ten seconds , and the cameras captured almost everything . The difference between the film version and actually being there is that in the film , when the elephant falls to the ground , there 's silence . In 1903 at Luna Park the earth momentarily rumbled . <p> 2 . Saartjie , alone <p> The Hottentot Venus was the name given to an African woman who 'd already been given the Afrikaans name Saartjie ( Sar-key ) Baartman . In 1810 she was brought from Cape Town , South Africa , to London , where she was exhibited as an oddity . She was a star attraction at the time . Not only was she African , she also had the physical characteristic known as steatopygia , an accumulation of fat around the buttocks , and it was her buttocks that were famous and became the focus of the show . <p> Crowds of people came and paid to see her walk , not quite naked , back and forth across a small stage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but people did n't care about her clothes . They came to see her unusualness . She would turn around or bend over , depending on the requests from the spectators . And when she complied , as she always did , there were always the gasps of amazement and then a joke and then laughter . And at the beginning she did n't mind that much . Although the whole experience was n't what she 'd been promised back in Capetown , she did n't want to quit . A world had opened up for her , and because she was intelligent she looked forward to learning about that world . She did n't enjoy the ridicule or the spit when people spat at her , but that was part of the world she knew , and she did n't want to leave that world . She just wanted to be happy in that world . She wanted the people to come to her show , but she wanted them to be different , to see her and treat her differently . And what she wanted did n't happen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say : " Will you please treat me with respect ? " or " Look at me as a person , " or " Get rid of your prejudice . " She spoke a little English , but language was n't the problem . The problem was the world she was in . <p> One night she was sleeping on her cot , and she had to pee . So she had a dream , and in the dream she needed to go to the bathroom . She was desperately trying to find a bathroom , trying to negotiate through the world of the dream to a place where she could pee . She kept trying to find relief but was not getting anywhere , and she was n't getting anywhere because she was n't searching in the right world . She was in the world of her dream , and in that world , even if she found a place to pee , it would n't have helped because the world in which she really needed to pee was a different world . She needed to see that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She needed a bigger picture , one that included waking up and going to the bathroom . <p> When I said that language was n't a problem , that was n't quite right . As her novelty wore off the abuse increased , and her so-called negative emotions-her resentment and anger and fear-also increased . And she felt these things , but when she tried to express them she was n't understood . These emotions stayed inside of her , and so , unable to communicate , and unable to see any way she could communicate , she began acting out , she became difficult to work with . Frustrated by her inability to affect the world she was living in , she began hating that world . <p> In 1814 she was sold or traded to a traveling circus and taken to Paris . She had her ups and downs , and she died a year later at the age of twenty-six . She was never considered totally and completely human by the people who observed her , and except for her genitals we do n't know what she looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some then-current theory about racial characteristics , dissected her and removed her genitals and her brain from her body . These were then placed in jars and put on display in Paris , at the Museum of Man . <p> 3 . Ganesha , the story <p> Ganesha is a kind of elephant , and he 's also a god in India . He has an elephant head and a human body , and he 's usually shown riding a rat or a mouse . He 's the god of wisdom , the god of obstacles , and the remover of obstacles , and because he 's a legendary figure , the story of how he got his elephant head has many variations . <p> In one version his mother , Parvati , is taking a bath . She wants privacy , and so she tells Ganesha to guard the door . Shiva , his father , comes to the house in disguise , and when Ganesha refuses to let him enter , Shiva cuts his head off . When his mother finds out , she 's so disconsolate that Shiva @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a passing elephant . <p> In another version , my version , Ganesha is a young man , and being a legendary figure he 's been given a test . There 's always a legendary test , and this particular test is to go to the edge of the known world . There 's a river there , and he 's told to cross that river . <p> Before he goes his mother warns him not to be fooled by demons . And by demons she means his so-called negative emotions , his hatred and resentment . He 's reminded not to see these emotions as anything other than passing . Thoughts and emotions come , he is told . And then they go . Neither grasp them nor push them away . <p> So , with this in mind , he sets out . He walks , day after day , until he comes to the end of the known world , and there , just as he was told , is a river , although it 's more like a stream . But it is a river . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the edge of the river . Ganesha could easily have crossed the river on foot without a boat , but the boat was idle , and he wanted to talk to the man . He walked to where the man was sitting , wrapped in scarves , his legs brown from the river mud . He says to the man something like , " May I rent your boat ? " or " Will you ferry me across the stream ? " or " What 's the cost to cross over ? " But the man does n't speak . In fact , the man does n't acknowledge Ganesha 's existence . <p> Ganesha tries to get his attention , but the man is absolutely still . He 's not deaf ; he 's just not responding , and Ganesha would like some response . He tries to communicate with the man , not just by speaking ; he signals to the man and even touches the man , but somehow he ca n't get through . He speaks again , carefully explaining his situation and why the boat would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the greatest god in the Hindu pantheon . But the man takes no notice . Ganesha keeps trying to connect , stubbornly repeating his needs , getting more adamant about the boat . The boat , he says . And just as stubbornly the man remains impassive . <p> And at that moment a bird passes between him and the sun , and for a flash he 's in shadow . Something changes . He hears a voice ; it 's the voice of his mother . He looks down into the stream , and a small , round pebble in the stream is talking to him , reminding him not to be fooled by his own impulses , not to believe that what he feels is anything other than what it is , feeling . And Ganesha knows that . He knows his emotions are transient , and he knows he could let them go and let the man go and just walk across the river to the other world . But he finds himself fearful of leaving the world he knows ; he 's drawn to that world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , even though he 's frustrated by the man 's incomprehension . He 's offended , in fact , by the man 's insensitivity and lack of common courtesy . The man is being unreasonable . <p> And Ganesha is at a kind of fork in his path . He could have listened to the pebble , seen his emotions for what they were , and let them go . But Ganesha ca n't hear the pebble because his anger and resentment are boiling up , and these feelings seem absolutely real to him . He has to do something . So he approaches the man , to teach him a lesson . He faces the man . He plants his feet on the ground , raises his arm into the air , and that 's when the man-Shiva in disguise-stands , and cuts Ganesha 's head off . At that moment , not too far away , an elephant is about to die . <p> 4 . Hottentot , in love <p> Paris , it 's been said , is the city of lovers , and while she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She did n't come into contact , real contact , with that many people , so naturally the person she fell in love with was her keeper , the man who fed her and led her to the stage where she made her money . As a whim the man encouraged her love . It was also his money she was making , and to that extent he cared about her happiness . Mainly he wanted the novelty , the proximity to fame , and of course the affection . They shared a kind of affection . <p> The thing about sex is that , at least for an instant , it 's real . And in her mind that reality expanded . She took that sliver of love and expanded it , believed in it , and let it make her happy , even if the actual love she received was usually abusive . She forgave him that because she wanted to preserve the possibility of happiness . Saartjie was trying to satisfy her need for human connection in the only way she knew , by loving . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than just look . He talked to her , sometimes , and when he felt like it he touched her . He was , in her world , about as good as it got . Although he was n't that good . He certainly did n't care for her , and she realized that the love she 'd been creating was an illusion . And she knew that happiness meant waking up . But to what ? The world she lived in was the only world she knew . She did n't know there was another world . <p> One night she was invited to a high society ball , a fancy costume party where her unusualness would be the conversation piece . The man escorted her about as far as the front door and then disappeared into the crowd . She looked around . There were rooms of people and paintings painted on walls . Statues were everywhere , and the stairways were carved and polished . People were dressed as soldiers and queens , and some of them wore masks . Saartjie did n't have a mask , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd spent the prior week sewing pink feathers to what we now call a bikini , although at the time the concept of bikini did n't exist . But she had her outfit . And she wore a pair of shiny silver slippers . She walked down the marble steps into the grand salon . A woman with a long gown and white , creamy skin began talking to her , and she began talking to the woman . Although her French was only rudimentary they carried on an intense and wide-ranging conversation . They stood next to a fountain with water bubbling , and the woman treated her as if she were a human being . Men approached her and asked her to dance , and food was brought to her on trays of silver . She thought she was in another world . In her effort to take in every aspect of this world-speaking with the woman , drinking champagne from a crystal glass-she 'd completely forgotten about the man . <p> Well , not completely . She was n't one hundred percent focused on the party because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd gotten into her thoughts , and maybe about five percent was thinking about him , but she was looking at the people dancing and hearing the music and roughly twenty percent of her mind was on the man , and she was looking at the woman , trying to listen to the woman , but she was thinking about the man , so much so that the conversation ended , and the woman walked away . Now it was only the man , and she wanted to be free of him . She wanted not to turn and begin looking across the room to find his face . She wanted to wake up . She realized that the man would probably hurt her , but she was more and more forgetting what that hurt was like . She felt the impulse pulling her , like a string rooted to her heart , and there was something that she needed , she felt it . He was cold and calm and terrible , and yet she turned . She swirled around to find the thing that gave her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dying <p> The day Topsy died was a cold , cold day , which did n't stop the people from coming out to watch . Electricity was a novelty , and movies were a novelty , but death was the main attraction . Topsy had been tied with chains and ropes , not because she was a man killer , but because man killers made publicity and publicity drew crowds . And they were there , gathered in a semicircle , with the ocean behind them , facing an area cleared of rubble . Luna Park was still under construction , and so an area was cleared where Topsy was going to die . And she knew she was going to die . That 's why she was uncooperative during the slow procession through the mud . They had a little trouble getting her out of her stall , and they wanted Gus to help , but he would n't do it ; even when they offered him twenty-five dollars he still refused . But he watched when they led her onto the makeshift stage . Her feet were guided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet that would contain the electric current and keep it from passing through the ground into the innocent spectators . Thick ropes held her in place so that when she fell she would n't fall far . And then they attached the electrodes-one to her right front foot and one to her left rear . <p> Topsy was facing the crowd , looking at them , and of course she was thinking of Gus . Unlike Saartjie , who wanted not to want her keeper , Topsy did n't care . She was tired of trying to be free of Gus and the habit of Gus , and now she 'd given up ; it was too much trouble . Unfortunately she was going to die . If there was ever a time she needed comfort or what passed for comfort , this was it . That 's why she was scanning the crowd to find his face , that familiar thing she was counting on to take her away from where she was . She was n't feeling that great , and she was craving a little Gus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women , and children eating candy , and men in caps , but not Gus . She kept looking for Gus , worried now and desperate . No more struggling for a happiness that seemed to be always eluding her . She was n't interested in happiness anymore . She just wanted Gus . If she 'd had a voice she would have called out . <p> And then she saw him . There he was in his clean white shirt and his old familiar cap . She looked into his face and waited for something to happen , she did n't care what it was-comfort , disappointment-it did n't matter . She wanted from Gus what she 'd always wanted , a connection , and she stood there , waiting , but it was n't happening . She could feel the cold metal of the electrodes digging into her skin . And his eyes ; they were n't exactly vacant , but they were n't doing anything . She kept looking at them , hoping something would happen , expecting it to happen . And when it did n't , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women staring at her , and they all looked the same to her , they all looked human . In their own eyes they might have seen a thousand subtle differences , but to Topsy they were indistinguishable . She was looking at them , and then beyond them , slightly , over their heads , to the ocean . She could see the waves forming and reforming in lines along the water . She was looking at the waves in the cold , calm sea . <p> And then the current entered her body . The sea got darker . She was watching it get darker and darker , and she opened her eyes and reached out through her eyes , watching the waves fade , one after the other , until finally they disappeared completely . <p>
