ILLUSTRATION BY EFFEKT-ETAGE STEP 1 Loosen the soil around the post footing using a digging bar . STEP 2 Use a posthole digger and shovel to remove soil on one side of the post footing . Rock the post back against the side of the hole . STEP 3 Assuming the post and footing are too heavy to lift , pry them up . Hold them in place with a rock or a chunk of wood . If you can get a clear swing at the concrete with a sledgehammer , break it up . Posthaste Q : I 'm a new homeowner , and I have a couple of large , strange-looking galvanized steel posts set in concrete in the backyard . One post has a head with a hood and the other has what looks like a steel shelf . I have no idea what these posts are , but I 'd like to remove them . What 's the best way to do that ? A : You have an old-fashioned retractable clothesline there , and you might think twice about removing it , given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of interest in drying clothes on a line . I recently counted 50 entries on the topic on the Web . For the typical household , drying clothes with an electric dryer costs between $60 and $80 a year . In terms of energy use , this appliance ranks right up there with running a refrigerator . Still , if the line and posts must go , be sure to take them out entirely . While it might be simpler to cut the post off as close to the ground as you can , the stub left behind would be a tripping and mowing hazard . The removal method shown here should work for just about any small post set in concrete . Oddball Water Heater Q : The gas-fired water heater in my laundry room sits on a shelf above the clothes dryer and pokes through a closefitting hole in the ceiling . There 's about in. of space around the heater 's perimeter . But there 's a problem : When the attic fan runs , it sucks out the heater 's pilot light . Is there a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it lets me turn off the a/c and save on electricity . A : I 've inspected about 10,000 houses in my career , but I 've never seen anything like what you 've described . Caulking the gap around the heater will probably prevent the attic fan 's negative pressure from extinguishing the pilot flame , and it would seal a large heat-leaking gap in the ceiling . What it wo n't do is correct building code violations or any hidden safety problems . For example , if the appliance 's exhaust vents into the attic , carbon monoxide might make its way into the house and potentially asphyxiate someone . You should get a plumber or a mechanical contractor to look at the installation as soon as possible to evaluate its safety and check its compliance with building codes . Clogged Drain Q : I 've got a partially clogged shower drain that I 've tried unsuccessfully to clear  --  first using a piece of wire , then a chemical drain cleaner . What 's my next move ? A : Buy yourself a hand snake and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First , try the plunger . Fold in the rubber cup on its front ( it 's used for unplugging toilets ) . Run water into the shower to seal around the plunger , then force its handle toward the drain and jerk it back to create a sucking action . No luck ? Try the hand snake . Loosen the thumb screw and feed out about 10 in. of the coiled spring ( the snake ) . Set the thumbscrew and crank the handle clockwise . Now pull the snake back , crank forward and repeat until you break through . Wipe the snake clean as you crank it back into the body . Finally , run hot water down the drain to flush it clear . If you advance 10 ft. of the snake and still have n't broken through , call in a pro . Subslab Erosion Q : Soil under our concrete-slab front porch has eroded . The slab bridges the gap and there are no cracks in it . Will the slab crack eventually ? A : Yes . Since a slab is only as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be filled with a slurry mixture of sand and cement funneled into the gap or rammed into it with a pushrod made of lumber . If you ca n't get the mixture into the gap because it extends too far under the slab , hire a mud-jacking company to pump a grout mixture into the space . Foggy Glass Q : I have double-pane windows that have " fogged " on the inside between the glass panes . Is the repair a do-it-yourself thing , or do I need to call a window guy ? A : Call a window guy . The cause is a failed seal between the glass panes and the spacer between them . Unfortunately , that means the window is shot . Replacing the window will save energy because the loss of the seal between the panes means the inert gas between the panes has escaped . Once that happens , the window has only a fraction of its former insulation value . It 's now probably comparable to a single-pane window with a sliding storm window .
