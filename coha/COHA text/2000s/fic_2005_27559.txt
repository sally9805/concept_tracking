Cuddles Houlihan got clipped by the vodka bottle as it exited the pneumatic tube . " Goddammit ! " The cry of pain that filled the office came not from Cuddles , whose head still lay asleep on his desk , but from the tube . Its ultimate source was the office of Joe Harris , the editor-in-chief . At this late , sozzled hour , Harris had mistakenly fed the interoffice mail chute not the translucent canister containing his angry communication to Cuddles , but the still-half-full , six-dollar quart of hooch he was regularly supplied with by the countess in the fact-checking department . Harris glowered for several seconds at the undispatched canister , before giving in to the impulse to open it up and look once more at what had enraged him in the first place : a photograph of Leopold and Loeb , smiling , each with an arm around the other , perched on the edge of an upper bunk in the Joliet State Prison , both of them avidly regarding the latest issue of Bandbox . The thrill killers held it open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were sharing on a back-porch swing . Would make a great ad , said the inked message on the back of the photograph , whose bold penmanship Harris recognized as belonging to Jimmy Gordon , up until eight months ago his best senior editor here at Bandbox . " I think of you as a bastard son , " he 'd once told Jimmy in a burst of bibulous sentiment . Now , as editor-in-chief of Cutaway , the younger man was his head-to-head , hand-to-throat , competition . If Harris did n't think of something , this picture of those two murderous fairies reading Bandboxthe magazine that had made goddamn Jimmy Gordon , and remade Jehoshaphat Harriswould be plastered tothe side of every double-decker bus crawling up Fifth Avenue . Rummaging his bottom drawer for another quart of vodka , Harrisa great curator of his own life storymanaged to consider , yet again , with prideful amazement , how only five years had passed since Hiram Oldcastle , the publisher , had said , " You want it ? It 's yours , " giving him the Bandbox job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An overpriced rag for overaged pansies , " Oldcastle had called the dying men 's fashion book , which had somehow never evolved out of the tintyped , stiff-collared days of McKinley . Harris would be the magazine 's last chance before Oldcastle killed the sclerotic monthly and concentrated on his more robust publications , like Pinafore , for the " young miss " edited by Harris 's girlfriend , Betty Divineand the shelter book , Manse . " Give me six months , " Harris had said . " Take a year , " Oldcastle had replied , sounding almost guilty about the eagerness with which the new editor wanted to take charge . It took Harris one business quarter to bring Bandbox to life , to hit upon a formula that lured young men and advertisers back to a magazine no one had paid attention to for years . He kept the fashioneven made it fashionablethen butched up the rest of the production , adding a slew of stylish articles about all the sports , politics , crime , money , and movies that went into the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding they craved the camel-hair coat on page 46 just as much as they needed to sleep with the screen siren or buy the radio stock described a few pages away . The table of contents might sometimes seem a tasteless whipsaw " New Hope for the Shell-Shocked " sitting right above " Look Terrific for Under Two Hundred " but the magazine 's turnaround had been so successful that by the spring of last year , Cond Nast decided he could not leave a whole new field to his usually more downmarket competitor , Oldcastle . Last March he had announced the start-up of Cutaway , exactly the sort of clothes-and-journalism book Harris had concocted ; and on April 30 , he had named Jimmy Gordon its editor . Jimmy Gordon : who had brought in most of Harris 's expensive new writers ; who had three bad story ideas for every good one , but so many of each that , with Harris as a filter , every issue of Bandbox still abounded with first-rate stuff . Jimmy Gordon , who was now stealing not only Harris 's formula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on the fourteenth floor of the Graybar Building . He 'd pried away three of his old writers , a photographer , and two production assistants , and had even made a run at Mrs. Zimmerman , the receptionist . But the real prize for Jimmy was Harris 's readers and advertisers , whom he would surely keep wooing away if he managed , with stunts like this Leopold and Loeb picture , to undo the makeover of Bandbox . Things could turn around so quicklyhad n't Harris himself proved it ? that the older editor would be left with a shrunken subscriber base consisting chiefly of the perfumed boys you saw gazing at each other across the tables of the Jewel cafeteria . Hazel Snow buzzed Harris from the outer office . " It 's a bad time ! " he shouted . Hazel ignored him . " Mr. Lord and Miss O'Grady here to see you , " she said , indifferent to anything but her desire to go home . Through the intercom Harris could hear the squeaky sound of Hazel putting on her galoshes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Richard Lord and Nan O'Grady once Hazel had ushered them in . The English art and fashion director looked at his expensive shoes , still unscuffed at this late hour , and whispered , " It 's about Lindstrom , I 'm afraid . " " What about him ? " Harris asked , in a voice that made plain , for all its volume , that he would rather know nothing new concerning Waldo Lindstrom , the handsomest young man in New York , and Bandbox 's most frequent cover model now that photographs were replacing illustrations . Harris would be more receptive to tidings of this Adonis were Lindstrom not also an omnisexual cocaine addict who had escaped from the Kansas State Penitentiary a few years ago at the age of twenty , and whose work for Oldcastle Publications depended on frequent payments from Harris to the NYPD 's vice squad . " He never showed up , " murmured Lord , while he adjusted the two points of his breast-pocket handkerchief . " Find his pusher ! " bellowed Harris . " Call the morgue ! Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " he continued , turning his eyes and anger to Nan O'Grady , the copy chief , whose lower lip had begun to tremble . A tear wobbled in the lower reaches of her left eye , ready to drip down her powdered cheek and cut a line that would run parallel to her straight red hair . " It 's Mr. Stanwick 's piece on Arnold Rothstein . " Max Stanwick , a successful writer of hard-boiled mystery novels , now also wrote features for Bandbox on the nation 's ever-burgeoning crime wave . The fact-checkers sometimes muttered that he had made no discernible shift from the methods of his old genre to those of nonfiction , but Stanwick 's pieces were immensely popular and the occasion for some of Harris 's more memorable cover lines : lend me your ears had announced Max 's recent report on a spate of loan-sharking mutilations in Detroit . Harris trembled at the thought of losing him to Jimmy Gordon , who had brought him to Bandbox in the first place . " And what 's the problem with Stanwick , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who ' instead of ' whom ' ? They 're gangsters , Irish . " Nan , who until two years ago had edited lady novelists at Scribner 's , and who had taken this better-paying job to help support the mother she lived with out in Woodside , forced her lower lip to stiffen . The tear in her left eye sank backwards without spilling . She glared at her boss . " It 's not a question of subject versus object , Mr. Harris . It 's a question of . . . schvantz . " She pronounced it with the lilting precision of a lieder singer . " Whose schvantz ? " Harris wanted to know . " Mr. Rothstein 's , apparently . " Harris hesitated for only a second . " Well , keep it in ! " Nan , her lower lip now fully retracted , held her ground . " I assure you that it 's in no known style book , and I guarantee you that within a week of publication , a half-dozen of your precious advertisers will have protested its use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris , suddenly on his feet . " And the balls to go with them ! This is a men 's magazine ! Out ! And close the door behind you ! " After Harris watched a trio of departing formsHazel 's among themthrough the frosted glass of his door , he allowed himself to sit back down and light a cigar . He looked out the fourteenth-floor windows of his corner office to the vertical world aborning all around him . The Bowery Savings Bank loomed in the southeast , and a few streets over , close to the river , he could see the absurd new towers of Tudor City , in whose tiny apartments his aging pals had taken to stashing their chorines and tootsies . Directly across Lexington Avenue , and also one block south , squares of earth were roped off for the great excavations now sprouting the Chrysler and Chanin buildings . It all made Harris dizzy . From his long-ago days on the Newburgh Messenger until this past fall , when Oldcastle had moved the company a few blocks up from its old quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed a single flight of stairs to reach his job . Now every morning and evening his stomach endured the fast jumps and drops of the Graybar 's elevator , the trip made worse if he happened to be sharing the car with Jimmy Gordon , who 'd be on his way to and from the Graybar 's fanciest floorreserved by Cond Nast even before the building went up , thus exciting Oldcastle 's competitive relocation . Harris took a gulp of the countess 's hooch and opened up the Evening Graphic to a cartoon panel above the " Aviation News " column , a few square inches he liked to settle into for a moment or two each evening as the clouds began turning pink outside his skyscraping aerie . TonightJanuary 13 , 1928 " New York 's Gas Lit Life " featured the sketch of a buxom " stagestruck damsel , " a young Lillian Russell type , auditioning for a well-fed theatrical manager . Little more than her parasol and bloomers shielded her ample virtues . Harris sighed , recalling the days of his youth , the long-ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever heard of exercise and before bosoms had deflated to the pitiful boyish protuberances on modern girls like Hazel Snow . He closed his eyes and , for a few seconds , took himself back to summer nights alive with the tootlings of oompah bands instead of the discordant , mystifying notes of jazz ; to the orating politician 's thrilling cry for free silver instead of Everyman 's current pursuit of ubiquitous easy money . Harris was sixty years old and , in truth , as much a throwback to the age of McKinley as the old Bandbox had been . But in order to sustain his reanimating magic , he had to keep current with all the flat chests and blues singers and tennis champions driving this frantic new age into which he 'd outlived himself . If only he could bring himself to leave the game , gracefully conclude his career by editing Knife and Fork , Oldcastle 's food magazine , for a couple of years .
