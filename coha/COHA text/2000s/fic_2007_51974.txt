Paul Park lives in Massachussetts with his family . His recent woik has been focused on a quartet of fantasy novels : A Princess of Roumania , The Tourmaline , The White Tyger , and The Hidden World . His new story for us makes an interesting counterpoint to Albert Cowdrey 's tale in this same issue . HE WAS FAMILIAR WITH THE house , of course , having seen it in photographs and once in person a dozen years before . He did n't remember it being so huge . He and Sabine had come up the walkway between these same bronze foo dogs , the male with its paw on a bronze ball . Then - still - the windows had been brown with sticky paper , opaque , as Jeremy had pointed out . No one had lived there for many years . The house had been abandoned after Arkady Ferson 's death in the early 1970s . There was a suggestion he 'd been murdered , a possibility that intrigued Sabine far more than Ferson 's small connection with the subject of Jeremy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he imagined , waited for him inside . Or else she was watching him from the front windows or the shelter of the porch - he did n't like that idea . The stone walk was a long one . His leg hurt . As he approached , he thought she might be calculating all the ways he 'd changed . He saw himself diminishing as he got bigger . He was kind of bald . He was n't in great shape . And of course he limped . Which would she notice first ? " Boo ! " She was perched along the back of the female dog , motionless , invisible , in clear sight . Now she scrambled down , and any consolation that the years might also have treated her unkindly was already gone . In the bright sunlight she seemed radiant to him , dressed in an Indian printed smock above her knees . It fastened with a string around her neck . She hugged him , and he was aware of her smell , which came back suddenly - the same lavender perfume mixed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around his neck , aware also of his damp , uncomfortable suit . This was the third time he was in Seattle and he 'd never seen a drop of rain - how small she was ! He had forgotten . Her face was close by his . She 'd never been a beautiful woman , he remembered with surprise . Her features had always been too big for her small face . But she had always seemed beautiful - a European trick perhaps - and younger than she was . At twenty-six she 'd looked like a teenager , especially at a distance . It was the language of her body - " gamine , " he supposed . Now , as she separated from him and scampered barefoot up the stairs , she looked twenty-six or so . He followed her through the line of fat white Ionic columns to the front door . He 'd read a little bit about the house , knew , for example , there was a fine Tiffany window over the staircase , and the walls had been handpainted by . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd not been interested in any of those things until he 'd had to imagine Sabine living here . She made a little pirouette in the cavernous , dark entranceway . " I 'm so excited to see you , " she said , her accent still thick . When he 'd first met her , she 'd scarcely spoken any English . Now she was fluent , obviously , and his French was rusty . So they turned naturally to a language they 'd never spoken with each other . " I ca n't wait to show you , " she said . She ran up the double stairway to the landing and stood below the window , a floral pattern of green and crimson glass . She wore an ankle bracelet , he noticed , and the bottoms of her feet were dark . " Tell me again how this happened , " he said . " I told you on the phone ! When Scott and I first moved out here , we bought a house in Fremont - you know ? But his parents were living too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a real estate sign - I 'd told him how I 'd knocked on the door with you - do you remember ? I had always remembered this place . Always I used to drive past when I had the chance , and when the sign came , Scott said it was an opportunity . But I suppose it was a gift for me - do you know Arkady Ferson also lived in Belgium ? We bought it from the Lightbearers Foundation - do you like it ? " she asked , as if she were talking about the dress she wore , and which she was modeling for him under the dappled light , and which he did like very much . It was blue and red and left her arms exposed . He could see the soft hair in her armpits . And she did n't have to bother with a bra or anything like that . Once he had shared a cab with her down Fifth Avenue , thirty blocks in rush hour from the University Club to her apartment - a cold , rainy night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . Her wet shirt had been unbuttoned to her waist . Why had n't she asked him to come up ? No , it was because he had to continue on cross-town . He was meeting Joanna and her parents at some Chinese restaurant on Ninth . AU the way there he 'd been sniffing himself guiltily , and he was already late , and Joanna was already pissed off . " She has no idea how virtuous I am , " he 'd thought as he 'd washed his face and hands in the cramped restaurant bathroom . The lavender smell had already dissipated , to be replaced , with any luck , by the scent of Joanna 's perfume , the musk oil she used to wear in those days . Sabine had met Scott right after that . He stood below her on the stair . She was smiling , and she raised her left hand to her mouth to hide her big teeth - an endearing gesture that he remembered now . Did she ever think about that taxi ride ? Was she thinking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be awfully rich ! " " Well , no - I do n't think so . I mean yes and no - I suppose we are . We have to work , of course . " Just out of law school when she 'd married him , Scott was now the head litigator for a timber company . A novice when Jeremy had known him , now he was some kind of A player , which even on the West Coast stood for something . Since the accident , of course , Jeremy no longer played . Had he told her about the accident ? He 'd mentioned the divorce , he knew . And the tenure decision . When she 'd met him he had already been working on his dissertation , his book on Leonardo Fioravanti . Some things had n't changed , at least . But it was squash that had brought them together , at the club where he 'd given lessons all through graduate school . The North American Open had been in Seattle that year . During the break after the Women 's C @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arkady Ferson 's old house . Jeremy had wondered if any of the Lightbearers still lived there . He was already out of the A draw . Now Sabine was talking to him and he realized he was n't listening . But he followed her from room to room . " . . .1 leave the door unlocked and it is best I do . You know it is the Asian art museum inside the park , and many times people think this house is part of the museum . So they come right into the front hall . I do n't like them to call me or ring the bell . But I keep a feather duster beside the door , and if I am downstairs I pick it up . That way they can think I am the maid , something like that . S'il vous plat , " she said , turning , hands on hips , knees together . " La patronne n'est pas la maison . It is mostly Chinese people who come in . " He laughed and she laughed too , hiding her teeth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filled the upper floor with brightness and shining dust motes . Jeremy wondered if the Lightbearers had ever sealed it up . Or was it only sections of the house that they 'd kept dark ? " You said you had something for me . " " La , la , la . It is a surprise . " She showed him her office and her exercise room . It was fined with mirrors and filled with low-tech wooden equipment . Nothing like the machines at the racquet club , they looked like Scandinavian toys for gifted children . When he asked about them , she lay down on one to demonstrate . But then she sat up suddenly , blushing , radiant . " I should wear a different dress , " she said . Because of the mirrors . " It 's beautiful , " he said . Embarrassed , she pointedtoward the open window . " I like the roofs best of all . Come with me . Can you , with your leg ? " " It does n't hurt . " " You will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the asphalt and tar . It was like an entire country up there , with mountains and flat places , and the skylight a reflecting pool . " I spend more time here than in the house , " she said - hard to believe . But on the steepest shingles there were marks of little trails , like goat paths in the Alps . Following her , he passed a cereal bowl and an empty juice glass balanced on a ledge . He found her squatting on the ridgepole , three stories above the street . He climbed atop a dormer and stood up . He could see the whole neighborhood of mansions , gardens , and big trees . There was a tower in the park across the street . " People come here to make love , " she said . " No , in the cars in that parking lot or by the curb . I do n't know why . Look , you can see them - " He saw nothing . He was watching her . " Sometimes I like to think about them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . And the taxi ride ? " What about Scott ? " he asked . She laughed , hid her mouth . " I hope he has a mistress . Poor man ! But you will see - tonight he is going to St. Louis for his business . " Before Scott she had married an American in Brussels where she was from , a Wall Street type . Once in the United States , he had treated her badly . That was the time Jeremy had known her best , when he was already living with Joanna . She had used to come to lessons close to tears . Squash had started as a way of keeping hold of her first husband , who had not deserved her . Now she squatted above Jeremy , knees apart . " What about Joanna ? " she asked . He shrugged . The subject was unavoidable . And then suddenly Joanna came back to him , an image of her face , her coarse hair and freckled skin . Her beautiful thick eyebrows , the hair on her arms and upper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd seen her the last time . He looked out toward the tower in the park . Sabine said , " Once I was up here and it started to rain . But the window slided down and I was trapped outside . So I saw a little man walking there along that street and I had to call out . I told him to go into the house and I led him upstairs with the sound of my voice - la , la , la ! Is n't that ridiculous ? He was just anyone ! " What did she mean by this little story , told in this bright tone ? He made a calculation : She must not have heard about Joanna 's death . No reason she should have . They 'd never met , after all . He turned back to look at her - smiling , squatting above him on the roof . No reason to bring up something that might cast a pall - literally , he supposed . No - figuratively . No - literally . It was not something he wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't forgive her . I thought I could , but I could n't . I broke my pelvis . I guess I told you . " " She was driving ? " " Yes , but it was n't her fault . It was on the Merritt Parkway . There was a big rainstorm . I looked up at her from the stretcher - she was soaking wet . We 'd put off having children until my job was permanent - just as well . She was always careful that way . " " I did not wish to make you sad . So , and Fioravanti ? " Jeremy smiled . " I 'm surprised you remember . That was the problem , was n't it ? No publications . Or else not enough - no book , at least . " Once more Sabine tried to change the subject . " I used to love to watch you play . " And in a little bit , " It 's not so wonderful sometimes , having children . Sometimes you feel like an imposter , I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother . " " I was n't even competing anymore , " Jeremy said . Embarrassed , he put his hand over his bald spot . " We 've all lost something , " he said - a fatuous remark . But she smiled , wrinkled up her nose . " T is distingu . But we must not let you get a sunburn for your interview ! And besides , I have not shown you what I found ! " " What did you find ? " In fact he was eager to know . That was why he was here , after all , not to reminisce about old happy times . " I found it downstairs . You will see ! " She 'd mentioned it on the phone when he had called . Something about Ferson and Fioravanti - his obsession . Now she hid her mouth again , - her hand was dark with asphalt . She was laughing at him , he thought . Stringing him along . She did n't move to go until a couple of minutes later - " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wo n't like her crazy mother up here . Quick , we must get down . " Carrying a book bag , a girl was walking down the street under the big trees . Sabine crouched out of sight , and then she slid down the shingles toward the back of the house . There she ran along the narrow lip of the roof , thirty feet above the garden , until she came to a small dormer - not the window they had climbed up through . Jeremy followed her more carefully , and by the time he dropped down into her bathroom , Sabine was already filling up a small brass tub , dipping her feet in . " Please , sit here and wash your feet . I had this made expressly . Scott thinks it is some kind of bidet . You must use a loofah and some almond soap . " He sat beside her on the tub 's wooden rail , scrubbing first one foot , then the other . Their thighs touched . Then she slipped away , scuffing her feet along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sophie ! Sophie ! " she called . " Il y a quelqu'un .... There is someone you must meet . " LATER , AT the conference hotel , lying awake past midnight , Jeremy tried to recompose the afternoon into an erotic history . He needed to calm down and get some rest . His interview was early and he needed this job - a tenure-track position at Butler College . And so he tried to imagine sexual intercourse on the burning rooftop or in the bathroom . That would have been more comfortable , spread out on those fluffy towels . But even in his own fantasy he was disturbed by small , fleeting memories of Joanna , her hair coarse and wild as she turned , her expression of surprise as he attempted to embrace her . No , he did n't want to think about that : Back to business . He spat on his palms , got to work . Nose to the grindstone . Hand to the plow . So - the bathroom , then . But there was Sophie outside the door . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him without a hint of suspicion . And then Scott had shown up , glad to see him , full of old times . Sabine had prepared a meal earlier that day , and now she just had to heat it up in the enormous kitchen . Already she seemed distracted . And she resisted when he asked her to show him the basement - that was the reason he had come , of course . Not to see how rich she was . He persisted . She refused . What was there to see ? A bunch of carpeted rooms without any light fixtures . Locks on all the doors . Scott laughed . " She 's got her little temple down there . No men allowed . " Sabine dried her hands on a towel . " There is not so much from the Lightbearers " time . Some books and so . " " But you mentioned something . " " Yes , of course . Just one thing . What do you think ? Here - I will walk you out . " He had to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the entranceway again . Then she picked up from the mantelpiece what looked like a spice bottle with a screw-on cap . " You see I remember what you told me all those years ago . " He took the bottle . There was some black liquid at the bottom of it , a thick black sludge . Confused , he held it up . She seemed proud of herself . But he felt stupid . " I 'd like to see the books , " he said , finally . " Anything . You 're sure you could n't show me the downstairs ? " That , suddenly , was the wrong thing to say . " You 're not even paying attention ! " Fragrant Goddess " - you see I remember . I kept it for you . I knew you would call one day . But you are never satisfied . Always you want more . " Now , in his hotel bed , Jeremy saw what she meant . He was unsatisfied . He wanted more . He wanted to walk down the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott had described it . Fragrant Goddess - was she kidding him ? But there was some crude Cyrillic script on the label . Something scrawled in pencil . Was this a joke she had whipped up in her kitchen , with its copper pots and pans ? If so , where had she found the recipe ? What was she hiding ? Some books and so - what books ? Down in the Lightbearers " labyrinth , Sabine was waiting for him in the dark . She was lying on her back before the private altar in her temple . But as Jeremy fumbled through the little rooms of his small fantasy , inevitably he found himself grabbing hold of other ghosts , old men long dead . And this was another kind of delusion : Perhaps in Ferson 's library there were some undiscovered papers , some new information about Leonardo Fioravanti , the Bolognese alchemist and surgeon who had tormented Jeremy all these years . In Naples he had discovered the cause of syphilis , the French Pox . Though spread through lechery , the root of it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meat to a pig , dog meat to a dog , hawk meat to a hawk , and watching them die of the disease . Fioravanti had the cure , though , for it and many other illnesses . Taken both internally and as a salve , his nostrums reduced fevers , knitted broken bones , cured heartsickness , took away all pain , even in hopeless cases , Jeremy thought . " Theriac " was one , made from snake 's blood . " Scorpion 's Oil " was another . " Fragrant Goddess " was a third , the strongest of all . It was a remedy Fioravanti had learned from a slave , a woman from the Spanish Netherlands whom he had liberated after the siege of " Africa , " a town on the Tunisian coast . To Jeremy he was a Protean , elusive figure . Because of the lies he told in print and even in his private correspondence , he seemed to represent a new phase in the history of masculine self-invention . This was what Jeremy 's book was about . And because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empirics in the late Renaissance , Jeremy had tried ( or at least lately he was trying ) to alternate chapters of conventional historiography with passages of historical fiction . Theory and argument gave way to invented narrative in different sections of the book - an invented secret history of Fioravanti 's life , a substitute for the actual Seciet History the alchemist had claimed to write , which was of course lost . In these fictional passages , however , Jeremy was beginning to see caricatures of his old professors and other long-standing experts in his field . And in the main figure of the drama , a caricature of himself . Men staggered into middle age so damaged and so hurt , so guilty , Jeremy thought , every one of them was looking for a magic balm to heal them without any need for introspection or forgiveness . In its multiple drafts , his manuscript now told the story of Jeremy 's disaffection , his distrust of academic knowledge , and his embrace , Fioravanti-style , of experience , lies , and sensory information . Now the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dreams , it was impossible for Jeremy to imagine an academic press would ever touch it . Impossible , also , to concentrate on the task at hand . Instead of Sabine in her temple , which just a few minutes before he had been decorating with embroidered pillows and silk brocades , bronze statuettes of Hindu deities and clouds of incense smoke , as well as ( God help him ! ) mirrors and exercise equipment while she lay flat on her back on the narrow bench , skirt rucked up , knees out to the side - now it was Arkady Ferson he imagined , an old man sitting stiffly on his stool in the same room . Arkady Ferson had lived in that house . He had haunted that basement . That had been his refuge , his own inner sanctum , away from the light . Jeremy had seen a photograph ( a timed exposure ? ) of an old man on a stool , a white-haired old man in a dark room . Now suddenly it was obvious that in his pose and gestures he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Autobiography - maybe there was room for Ferson in his book ! Why not ? Surely no discussion of empiricism was complete without trying to reproduce , as Ferson had claimed , the alchemist 's results . No discussion , also , of charlatanism or fraud . All of us had broken bones to heal , fevers to bring down - Arkady Ferson , originally from St. Petersburg , had understood that much at least . He had come to Seattle in the 1950s . With his followers he had moved into the big white house and published a series of occult treatises , including two at least on Fioravanti : If illness were a symptom of divine rage , then secret knowledge was God 's grace . The adept would begin to glow like a metal vessel in the process of distilling - a metaphor that Ferson took quite literally , hence the sealed windows and the chambers without light . So : a nut-job , obviously . A dead end . But Fioravanti , too , had been despised and hated by his peers , had died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . He really needed the Butler job . And so to distract himself he returned to his sexual fantasy , determined to organize it in a more efficient way : He would go to the house the next morning , after his triumphant interview . Sabine would have left the door unlocked . Scott was in St. Louis . But Jeremy would n't climb the stairs or go to search for her up on the roof . He would find the basement , and he would bring a flashlight , and in a warren of little rooms he would find a hidden chamber , a closet , really , and on dusty shelves there would be a complete set of the 1609 edition of Fioravanti 's works . Maybe there would even be a diary - Alexander would help him with the Russian translations .... No , no , no . In his hotel bedroom , Jeremy dried his hands on the bed sheets and turned over onto his side . " It is incredible how virtuous I am , " he told himself . Drained of his last erotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Sabine 's house , in a crystal - no , a carved , hinged , wooden case , he would find the only copy of the master 's Seciet History , hand written , never published , though referred to often in the Autobiography - the repository of all his alchemical wisdom . And he would hear Sabine behind him . " What are you doing here ? " And he would turn off the flashlight , leaving them in darkness . He would turn toward her , and both of them would glow with secret knowledge or nostalgia or desire . " You 're beautiful , " he 'd say . So many regrets . Memories like ghosts . Ah , God , he thought , suddenly sleepy - was it possible that a ghost could move through time , haunting and changing and poisoning the past ? ON THE TENTH of September the sea wall was broken in three places after a bombaidment lasting thirteen days . Don Juan de Vega , the Spanish viceroy of Sicily , entered the town at four o'clock . Theie was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken iefuge in the mosque . But by the western wall , neai the gardens of Aphiodisium that had given the city its name , all was quiet at the end of the afternoon . Gioidano Orsini had allotted the poor neighboihoods to his men . Files burned theie overnight . The Spanish captains had leserved foi themselves the mansions of the Afiican governors and the Turkish corsairs . The richest house in that western distiict belonged to Biambaiac , the African commander . Don Garcia de Toledo chose this house to sleep in . But in the evening when he arrived , he was disturbed to find the roof had collapsed during the bombardment . The uppei walls weie bioken in . Don Garcia stood between the great stone lions at the gate . He sent his men to find another house close by . Late as usual , and unaware of this change of plans , Leonaido Fioiavanti arrived after dark . He had been working in the baiiacks outside the city , wheie theie was an infiimary . Foi three weeks since the beginning of the siege , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , setting bioken bones , ungating gunshot wounds with quinta essenza and balsamo artificiato . Despite all efforts , manysoldieis and sailois had died under his hands . Stinking , weary , and discouraged , he came at last to the lion gate . He had walked in daikness through the deserted loads , and everything was daik . Latei he would wiite of this campaign to say that it was worth a dozen couises in the univeisity . He would boast of his miiaculous cuies . But at that moment he peiceived no benefit . He stood with his hand on the stone haunch of the female lion , surveying the broken building , its black , gaping windows along the front . Theie weie no stais 01 moon . Toichlight came obliquely from other houses , and the sound of muffled cries . But in the daik building nevertheless theie was a glimmei of candlelight . Maybe Don Gaicia was theie after all , he thought , in some undamaged section of the palace . So the suigeon persevered up the long flagged path , climbed the long stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the front part of the house was nothing but collapsed rabble behind a moie-oi-less intact faade . Foi when he looked through the empty dooi , the yawning wooden casements , he saw the fiist-flooi ceilings weie still whole , and theie was even a staiicase leading nowheie . This he glimpsed in the candlelight , a single tiny flame that hesitated by the stau . Then it disappeared , but not before he had seen the impiint of a small naked foot in the dust - suiely a woman 's footpiint ! " Captain ! " he shouted , and then diewhis swoid . Who was this in the ruined house of Biambaiac2 News of this piince had even spiead to Naples , the splendoi of his gardens , the iichness of his tables , and the beauty of his many wives and concubines . Maybe one of these still haunted the wrecked mansion . Though the surgeon still hovered in the doorway , his mind moved boldly through the darkness , following the flame - she might be a Christian woman from Antweip 01 Ghent 01 Brussels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then sold as a slave in the disgusting bagnios of Algiers . Now she was homeless and without iefuge in this city of infidels . How giateful she would be to any rescuer or protector , a girl scarcely grown ( if you could judge by the size of hei footpiint ) , yet skilled in all the lecheious aits . Shouts came from up the street . The surgeon stepped over the threshold . Sword outstretched , he shuffled into the darkness , following the place in his mind wheie he had seen the candle flame . Among the piles of rubble he poked his way towaid the back staiicase . And as he moved , he imagined he saw some light back theie , an oiange glow ieflected from a seciet source - perhaps a fire burning in an inner court . Instead , behind the bioken staiicase he found a wooden staii descending to the cellars . And at the turning of the staii he sawhei - just a ghmpse before she disappeared . And he was mistaken to have thought she was carrying a candle . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hei hands especially , a dim , orange light . He put up his swoid , slid it back into its sheath . Part of him was too weary for this adventuie . In the battle on the beach , he had taken a thrust from an African knight - that was weeks ago , and yet the wound hadn " t healed . Walking downstaiis was painful , and he managed it a single step at a time , descending into daikness - wheie was she2 . She had vanished ahead . But he could heai hei voice ahead of him , a little sing-song murmur gatheiing him on . At the second turning he went forward like a blind man , both hands outstretched . Theie was a stone corridor , and a stone chamber at the end of it , and what looked like a fire burning there ; he could n't tell . The witch was waiting with her back turned . She was wrapped in stiips of cloth , and theie was cloth ovei hei face andhaii . The light glowed aiound hei . Limping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it away . Alieady he understood something was wiong ; when she turned towaid him he let out a cry . Foi this was no Chiistian beauty from theharem of Brambarac , melting with shy gratitude for her deliverance . But she was old , older than he , thirty-one or two at least , with coarse wildhaii and a spot on hei daik cheek . Hei eyebiows weie thick and tufted , and there was hair on her upper lip . She stunk of some musky peifume , an oil smeaied on hei body to hide hei iottenness- , he was n't fooled . Limping forward , he grasped hold of hei thick neck , crushing her throat befoie she could make a sound 01 summon hei familial . He pulled hei down onto the flooi , piessed the weight of his body into hei as she flailed and thiashed - ah , God , would it ever end ? Jeremy started awake . Horrified , he sat up in bed . Heart pounding , he put his hands to his face . Once he had listened to a lecture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor had claimed that the central figure in a dream , or else the dominating sequence of events , could have no meaning . No , it was the furniture , the incidental details that were able to teach us something about ourselves . Now , awake , Jeremy saw the truth of this . In his dream-state he had grasped something his waking self had missed . Fearfully , hesitaritly , he closed his eyes again . He allowed himself to imagine the stone cellar in Brambarac 's ruined palace - this time as a set devoid of actors . There was a series of stone apertures halfway up the wall . And there were bottles , old apothecary bottles with glass stoppers and hand-printed labels - oh , it was obvious . It was n't Sabine who had mixed up some poisonous sludge as a joke to mock at him and his obsessions . Why had n't he believed her ? She had given him a bottle of Arkady Ferson 's Fragrant Goddess , prepared by him and described in his 1969 treatise , the veracity of which Jeremy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have hidden some of it before he died . Naked , Jeremy jumped out of bed and searched the wastebasket where he had dropped the bottle the previous night . He twisted open the crusted lid , smelled some of the foul liquid . Was it possible the old man had dosed himself with this ? Even at the time there had been speculation he 'd been poisoned , murdered by some other cult member in a squabble over the foundation 's vanished funds . No one had been prosecuted for the crime . Jeremy resealed the bottle , studied the label . Dushistaia Boginia , it said in Cyrillic letters . Fragrant Goddess . Leonardo Fioravanti had told the story many times , how in Palermo in the 1580s he had cured the wife of the Governor of Sicily . In the middle of the street she had vomited up a hairy , mottled mass as big as a baby . Afterwards she 'd been in perfect health . That was after a single dose . If you read between the lines , it was obvious the elixir contained both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pointed out . The precise recipe , along with its various palliatives , he claimed to have recorded in the Seciet History . He did not publish them in the Autobiography , or any of his other books . Dying in poverty in Rome , why should he bequeath to an ungrateful world the secret of these miraculous cures , discovered and refined with so much difficulty ? Why indeed ? But there was no time for Jeremy to think about these things . He was already late . He showered , put on his suit , went downstairs for his interview at nine o'clock . The search committee had a room at the conference . He knocked on the door of a sixth-floor suite in the same hotel . Besides some armchairs and the woman he was supposed to meet , there was a bed with a shiny quilt and a mountain of pillows . Often he was good at interviews , but not this morning . He found himself distracted by a notion that was almost entirely a fantasy - was it possible that Arkady Ferson had discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a batch of Fragrant Goddess and the other cures ? No , it was not possible - the manuscript had never been found . There was no reason , independent of Fioravanti 's claims , to assume it had ever existed . And surely , if it had come into his possession , in Brussels or St. Petersburg , perhaps , Ferson would have boasted of it , written about it in his idiotic treatises , sold it when he was short of cash . Still , at the same time was it credible that Ferson would have drunk the contents of the screw-top bottle if he had n't at least thought his recipe was genuine ? But what an idiot ! These ancient manuscripts , discovered at long last , always turned out to be forgeries . What had Sabine said ? " Some books and so . " Okay , so maybe Ferson had discovered something , purchased something that turned out to be a fake . Then maybe he had poisoned himself out of stupidity or else despair . Or else he had died of natural causes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle had been prepared as something to impress the Lightbearers , one of a long sequence of frauds : Ferson and Fioravanti were one of a kind ! And if Ferson had n't said anything about the manuscript , it was for the same reason Fioravanti had destroyed it or never written it - the desire for alchemical or secret knowledge , the conviction that secrecy was a prerequisite for holiness or truth . These men were n't professionals like Jeremy , who even now was plotting out an article on this entire subject , a publishable article that would enable him to ace his interview with Butler College , which at this exact same moment he was in the process of blowing with his disjointed and distracted answers to the most basic questions - the woman was looking at him as if he 'd lost his mind . They sat in circular armchairs and she stared at him . Had she heard anything about him , any rumor of misconduct ? She was attractive , too , in a sharp sort of way , her blond hair pulled back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this bed with all the pillows . Had anyone slept in it the previous night ? His interview lasted forty-five minutes . When it was over and the door had closed behind him , he scarcely remembered what he 'd said . Maybe he had made self-deprecating jokes . Maybe he 'd discussed his thesis , summarizing it poorly , because his mind was elsewhere and ( it now occurred to him ) whole sections had to be rewritten . He stood in the hallway looking at an immense potted plant , thinking that if a man were lucky , his secret history would die with him , the submerged causes and poisonous events . His autobiography would not include them , or anything else that made him special or unique . All that could be pieced together , as if by policemen or detectives searching for clues . That was true for Fioravanti , and Arkady Ferson , and Jeremy as well . He limped along the blue carpet toward the elevator . Someone passed him , a woman hurrying toward the interview he 'd just left . Doubtless she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just out of graduate school . He took the elevator to the ground floor and limped out into the street . Another glorious June day . Where had everything gone wrong ? People passed him and they could n't tell . How could they know ? A man in a suit : How could they tell that everything was finished , gone , done ? How could they know that it was only just a matter of time before it all fell apart , and he was punished as he deserved ? Things had started out so well . But Fioravanti , too , had had this experience - in Naples , Venice , and Madrid , his career had followed the same trajectory . He had acquired aristocratic patrons , stunned the city with his cures . But then the doctors and professors had conspired to drive him out , ruin him - it was always the same . In Jeremy 's case , it was Joanna who had broken him - quite literally on the Merritt Parkway . He 'd never been the same after that . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his thesis had gone wrong , his teaching , too . She had broken him and then abandoned him . Now she was dead . The police , when they 'd come to talk to him , had been like children or like stupid undergraduates , never asking the right questions . In the pocket of his coat , his fingers closed around Arkady Ferson 's bottle . He pulled it out , examined the penciled script . Then he turned uphill toward the art museum and Sabine 's house . As he climbed , he labored to put these thoughts behind him , all these ways of blaming others for his own mistakes . They were part of the secret history , which had never been recorded , or else had been destroyed , and which in any case was even less reliable than what you saw on the outside , where fraud could be challenged and ascertained . He came into the neighborhood of prosperous houses , bigger and bigger as he climbed uphill . At the top he came to Sabine 's house with its bronze guardians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy a flashlight in a Walgreens near the Jimi Hendrix statue . Now he stood between the foo dogs with Ferson 's bottle in one hand and the flashlight in the other ; he limped up the steps . And the door was unlocked , and the house was in shadow , and he moved through the atrium to the stairwell at the back of the house , under the Tiffany window . " Qui est l ? Sophie , est-ce que c'est toil " But he found the doors and climbed down into the Lightbearers " domain , where Arkady Ferson had lived out his fraudulent life , met his fraudulent end . He switched on his flashlight , made the turning of the stair . Then he was in among the small dark rooms , some with mattresses still on the floor . This is where the Lightbearers had lived , indulged their superstitions and their mad old master . This was where Sabine had followed in their footsteps ; she had always been interested in astrology and things like that . Low ceilings , cheap particleboard smelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scent of lavender and incense - it led him on . Sabine , of course , was behind him at the top of the stairs . " Who are you down there ? I will call the police ! " - who indeed ? It was n't the first time someone had made that threat . Small dusty objects skewered by the flashlight 's trembling beam . Where was he ? What did he expect to find ? Sabine was behind him . He could hear her footsteps . And then he came to the end , a square room with a single entrance . Stone walls ahead , the foundation wall . An industrial carpet . A four-poster bed with a canopy . A bookcase . Some books and so . Sabine was behind him . She was at the door . Brave girl - " What are you doing here ? Why are you here ? " Holding up the light , he turned to look at her . He could n't tell if she could see his face . Maybe she thought she 'd recognized him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible she could see some of his secret essence , because he 'd scared her . He was not what he pretended and she knew it ; she looked terrified . He painted her face , stroked her body with the fight . She was dressed in a white shirt and blue jeans , cowboy boots . A gold necklace . Gold earrings . Yellow hair pulled back . She squinted , held up her hand . " You 're beautiful , " he said . Nothing else - he did n't have to say anything else . But he came toward her , smiling , the bottle in one hand , the flashlight in the other . Her old friend , - she had kissed him once . Did she remember ? The flashlight gave him an advantage and he turned it off , leaving them in darkness . Then he dropped it and the bottle too , stepped toward her with his hands held out . He saw nothing as he reached out toward her . But then he could hear her fumbling for the door . He jumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bolt . The darkness made him dizzy . He fell to the floor onto his hands and knees , groping for the light . He dug his fingers into the heavy carpet . Had the Lightbearers locked Arkady Ferson in here , shut him up like an animal until he died ? The flashlight had rolled away someplace , was nowhere to be found . But his hand fell on the screw-top bottle . He sat up cross-legged with the bottle in his lap . Maybe Sabine was already calling the police . Maybe he did n't have much time . But he had always been a quick study . In the darkness he was already developing the skills of a blind man , whose other senses grow to compensate ; his ears were ringing . His fingertips , stroking the glass bottle , picking at the lid , were perfectly sensitive to texture and to temperature . And he could smell Sabine 's lavender perfume , which masked a darker , musky odor . As he waited , it occurred to him he did see something after all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall .
