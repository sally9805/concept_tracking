Her name was Deborah , and such a nice girl she was ! How smooth the brown hair ; how crisp the kerchief folded over her dress and tied in a bow at her back ; how stiff the flowered skirt ; how trim the white stockings crisscrossed with black slipper ribbons ! She was returning from her daily lessons at the Dame 's school , the very nicest Dame 's school in all Boston , where the three Rs were taught , and catechism and deportment . Truly , Dame Meredeth would have been proud of her pupil 's deportment had she seen how sedately Deborah walked up the brick path between the boxed flower beds that scented the warm air of the balmy day . Around the corner of the house came her brother Tom , beating a military rhythm on a copper kettle . " This is the way I shall play a drum when I go to war ! " he shouted , and led the way to the place where Mother and Granny sat sewing beside a crisp fire , for it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What is war ? " asked Deborah , after she had greeted her mother and grandmother with a curtsy , as she had been taught in school . Mother 's face was sad . " War means sorrow , and worry , and not hearing from dear ones , " she answered , for she had not had a letter from friends and kinfolk in England for almost a year . Granny 's eyes dashed indignantly . " War means drinking herb tea in place of real tea , " she added , with a glance at the canister on the shelf where the children knew she had hoarded her last bit of tea since before the Boston Tea Party . Tommy looked as if he did n't think women knew much about wars and declared , " War means guns , and fighting , and horses , and drums , and rides at night . " He beat upon his kettle and chanted , " I am going to war , I am going to war ! " " Oh , Tommy ! " gasped Deborah , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will go to war to drive the Red Coats from our country , " taunted Tommy , and gave his drum a crash that nearly deafened his mother and grandmother . " You are but twelve years old and not a man yet , " his mother intoned . " I am man enough to beat a drum or carry powder or-or do many things . Last night Father let me help him clean his musket . If I had a gun , I would shoot , and if I had a horse , I would ride , like Master Paul Revere , to Philadelphia or New York or wherever . " " I will go to war , too . I will beat a drum or carry powder , " sang Deborah , catching the war spirit . But Tommy was not to be bothered with girls in war time . // " You go to war ! " he exclaimed . " You ca n't go to war . Girls do n't go to war . Why-why girls wear petticoats . Who ever heard of petticoats at wars ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl , and she did wear petticoats , many of them . She had always liked her petticoats , and was proud of the fact that she wore one more than any other girl who attended the Dame 's school . " Nevermind , " consoled Granny comfortingly . " If girls ca n't go to war because of their petticoats , they can at least have pretty ones . See , I have just finished the last scallop on your new red petticoat-made of the last flannel we shall get from the home country for many a moon . " Deborah buried her hands in the soft red folds and ran her fingers around the embroidered scallops . How like the petals of the newly blooming tulips ! She knew it was for next autumn 's wear . Granny was thrifty and always made the winter clothes in the spring and laid them away in the storage chest until fall , smelling of cedar and camphor , just about the time she started cutting out the muslins and prints for next spring . Deborah wished they would let her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . How Mehitable and Ann would admire it ! Their petticoats were not embroidered in scallops like this one . She leaned against Granny 's knee . " Please , Granny , may I wear it just once to school before I put it away for the summer ? " " Fie , child , " rebuked Granny , " that is but vanity . Besides it is too warm for a woolen petticoat . " " I am wearing one flannel petticoat now , Granny , " protested the girl . " But it is worn thin by a whole winter 's wear child . Besides , have n't I told you to put the petticoat away ? " " But Granny , " insisted Deborah beginning to look cross , pulling her eyebrows into a frown and pursing her red lips into a pout . Mother had said nothing until now " Deborah , " she began sternly , " you are being rude and disobedient to your grandmother . Are those tears I see ? You are acting like a baby and the place for a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your bed , a proper place for babies . " With the new petticoat still in her arms , and tears streaking her cheeks , Deborah curtsied to her mother and grandmother , and walked out of the room without a look at Tom who had stopped his tattoo on the kettle so that he could overhear all that was said . The black kitty , Rebel , rose from his warm place on the hearth , stretched himself , and with tail erect , walked silently at his mistress 's heels , down the hall , up the curving staircase , and down another hall to Deborah 's room with its braided rug and curtains made of chintz . // Deborah undressed slowly . Side by side with toes straight , she placed the black slippers . One by one as she removed her garments , she laid them on the ladderback chair . On the top of the pile she put the new , red , scallopy petticoat , then moved the chair so that she could see the petticoat after she got in bed . She took as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap and buttoning the long white nightgown , carefully counting each button clear to the thirtieth one at the hem , where she always tripped if she did n't hold it up . She stopped to look at her sampler stretched on its frame by the window Much as she usually dreaded her stint on her sampler , she would have been glad to sew on it now Even that would be better than going to bed . Although she knew the rhyme by heart , she ran her fingers over the letters saying each word aloud , " Here is my sampler . Here you see How well my mother Cares for me . " At last there was no firther excuse to keep out of bed , so she dragged out the step , climbed it , and plumped herself into the middle of the big fourposter bed , which was round and puffy with its feather mattress . Not until she had wriggled around so that only the top of her cap and her teary brown eyes could be seen , did Rebel leap to a place at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to watch his mistress with one drowsy eye . // She heard Tom beating his drum in the garden . She heard her father 's voice in the hall and heard him go out again , probably on one of those mysterious errands far the Sons of Liberty . Pretty soon , she heard the sound of china and silver , and she knew the family were at dinner . She was sure no one would come to see her , for she was in disgrace . Her room grew quite dark . Rebel was asleep and purred only when startled by the wriggling of her feet . She wished she could sleep like Rebel , for then it soon would be morning . She heard the old clock on the landing strike seven , then eight , nine . She had begun to think the clock was broken ; for surely it was time for the ten o'clock strike , when she heard stealthy footsteps beneath her window . Who could it be ? Robbers ? Indians ? Red Coats ? A handful of gravel struck her window The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleamed brightly . She would run to her mother and Tom . " Friend ! " came a voice in a guarded tone . " Friend ! " the voice called again . Trembling , she pushed the shutters open . The moon shone on the uplifted face of her father 's friend . " Yes , Master Revere , " she whispered . " I have to cross the river tonight to ride for the Sons of Liberty . I must pass the British Man of War and have nothing to silence the creaking of the oars . Will you throw me a piece of flannel ? " Deborah glanced about the room . A shaft of moonlight fell on the beautiful petticoat . Like a flash , she dropped it into the waiting hands , and stood watching the men on their way down the street . Then down the hall she ran to the sitting room where her elders sat talking . " What does this mean ? " demanded her mother . " Out of bed and in your nightdress ! " Throwing herself on her mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You gave him your petticoat ? " said Grandmother . " Yes , " sobbed Deborah , " my petticoat that I acted such a baby about today . " " But not this evening , " her mother assured her . " You acted like a grown-up , to give up your new petticoat to such a service . " " And you shall have a cup of real tea , " said Granny , reaching for the canister . Tom , who had come tumbling out of bed , wailed , " Why did n't I hear them ? If they 'd wanted me to , I would have gone with them-or beat a drum or given them Father 's gun ! " " But , Tom , " explained Deborah , contentedly wriggling her toes , " it was a petticoat they wanted . " // <p>
