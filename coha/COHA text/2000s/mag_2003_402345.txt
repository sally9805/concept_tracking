Despite the fact that erectile dysfunction ( ED ) has been out of the proverbial closet for several years , it pretty much remains a taboo , especially for those who suffer from it . Such attitudes notwithstanding , RD is likely to become one of the major healthcare concerns as the percentage of men in their advanced years in the society continually increases . In fact , issues related to sexual function in both men and women already figure prominently in professional circles and public health policy forums . The emphasis on healthy sexuality is of societal importance because , as detailed later , numerous factors contribute to what is now referred to as compromised libido or " low mojo , " as the fictional Austin Powers would have it . Ancillary variables contributing to compromised sex drive are exactly that , secondary to primary metabolic and physiologic causes . Erectile dysfunction illustrates the issues associated with sexual function rather well . It is established that in 70 to 75 percent of the cases , ED is due to poor circulation in the penile tissue , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , diabetes and others . That is , if blood flows smoothly and unhindered throughout the body , the likelihood is that ED would not present itself . Of course , ED is a more complex condition and may also be precipitated by both psychogenic ( such as fear of intimacy ) and biogenic factors ( for example , congenital testosterone deficiency ) , as is the case with the remainder of the 25 to 30 percent of those afflicted with ED . Whereas psychogenic and biogenic ED is best managed under competent clinical supervision , nutritive intervention in enhancing circulation is potentially a preferable regimen , if only to obviate the side effects associated with pharmaceuticals . To better appreciate this , it should be noted that the erectile process is critically dependent upon blood flow into the penile tissue . As complex as it is , in essence it is how quickly nitric oxide ( NO ) is broken down in the erectile cascade . If NO is degraded more rapidly than it is produced , erectile process is likely to collapse . In contrast , if NO levels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to successful culmination . Viagra , the blockbuster drug , avails itself of this basic mechanism , namely that it inhibits the function of the enzyme that degrades NO . While a market dynamo , Viagra not only has rather unpleasant side effects associated with it but also it is not uniformly effective in ED patients . Consequently , many clamor for safer , perhaps natural alternatives to resolve ED . Any nutritive that meaningfully induces NO production is expected to help mitigate RD over a period of time . The nutritive Stimulin , comprised of the amino acid citrulline , improves blood flow rather effectively both in the penile area and systemically.1 Citrulline induces NO production via arginine but has a distinct advantage of serving literally as a " pacemaker " for vasodilation . That is , at any given time , only that amount of citrulline is used to produce NO that the body requires to fulfill its metabolic needs . As such , citrulline is stored , as its naturally occurring form has a storage depot in the liver and kidney for its expedient mobilization . Importantly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of NO to offset its degradation rather than inhibiting one step in a cascade of reactions that can , and in fact does , throw a spanner that results in side effects . As such , citrulline is devoid of side effects . As a nutritive , however , it exerts its beneficial effects over time . Postponement of " instant gratification " yields significant dividends . It not only primes the body to utilize its own machinations to offset ED with profound implications but also it should help avert side effects . The term " libido " is used rather loosely to characterize sexual dysfunction and is ordinarily taken to mean low sex drive . Used in its original Freudian sense , libido pertains exclusively to sexuality , its functions and manifestations.2 While the term has undergone many revisions over the years , in terms of sexual dysfunction , its original , albeit narrow , connotations still prevail , particularly as applied to alleviation of underlying problems as in ED . Strictly speaking , while compromised libido and low sex drive could be clinically put asunder , they are reciprocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instance , chronic fatigue , stress or mild depression may lead to low sex drive but their impact on libido can not be ignored . Seen thus , libido is the psychic and physical energy that drives sexuality . That is , the physical energy that the challenges and demands of daily life deplete . Also , all the connivances of present day life contribute to depletion of the energy necessary for healthy libido , including the side effects of medications.3 Therefore , a nutritional energy source should normalize libidinal response . The Peruvian herb Maca ( Lepidium Peruvianum ) is the nutritive in Maca-Stimulin to serve as that energy source . Both by scientific evidence and anecdotal accounts , Maca fosters vitality , stamina and significantly helps restore hormonal balance in women . Of course , the role of proper circulation for healthy sexual function can hardly be overemphasized . A combination of citrulline and Maca , therefore , in Maca-Stimulin should both promote circulation and provide the body with robustness necessary for healthy sexuality in both men and women . Sidebar The Male Erectile Process Step 1 : Sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start firing . Step 2 : Once stimulated , these nerves release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine in the penis . Step 3 : Acetylcholine , in turn , causes the endothelial cells in the penile arteries to begin producing NO by the action of a specific enzyme called nitric oxide synthase . Step 4 : Once produced , NO triggers the release of another chemical cyclic guanosine monophosphate ( cCMP ) . Cyclic GMP is one of the many potent vasodilators found in the human body . Step 5 : As cGMP levels increase , the smooth muscles of the penile arteries relax , the vessels dilate and Increase blood flow cause ; tumescence of corpus cavernosa , producing an erection . Step 6 : Even as NO continues to generate cGMP , another enzyme begins to break it down . This enzyme , known as phosphodiesterase , functions like a brake on the entire cascade of reactions and prevents erections from becoming excessive or permanent ( priapism ) . Priapism can cause permanent damage to erectile tissue . Step 7 : Following climax , or cessation of sexual stimulation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acetylcholine . In the absence of acetylcholine , the endothelial cells stop NO production , without which no cGMP can be produced . The residual cGMP is degraded by phosphodiesterase . The net result is that smooth muscles once again contract as the penile tissue goes back to its non-aroused , flaccid state . This flow sheet demonstrates how easily this balance of steps in the erectile process can be affected at any step and how erectile dysfunction could ensue . Importantly , it also suggests that increased production of NO can enhance libido .
