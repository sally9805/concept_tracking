Must Love Dragons By Stephanie Rowe Warner Forever Stephanie Rowe Theresa Nichols was going to starve to death and no one cared . She did n't know which was ticking her off more , the fact that she had n't had her no-carb pretzel fix in a week , or the fact that Quincy LaValle had apparently forgotten her yet again , like everyone else in her life . Her stomach growled and a sharp pain ground through her gut . Who needs to eat ? Certainly not an eleven-foot winged dragon under house arrest , hidden away because people in New York City would freak out at the sight of a real dragon . No need to be spotted by someone who could start the next world war with shrieks of invasions , Martians , and other such panic-inducing nonsense . Because of the close-mindedness of humans , she 'd been stuck behind closed doors for two hundred years , and quite frankly , it was getting old . Especially when she was withering away , alone and forgotten and starving to death . Since she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost 161 pounds . Completely unacceptable ! She was a dragon , dammit , and dragons had needs ! Food , violence , destruction , incineration . None of which she was allowed to indulge in Quincy 's house . Heaven forbid she burn anything up or turn his neighbors into crispy critters . Being deprived of food was making it that much harder to resist all her otherdragon desires . She groaned and leaned her head against the fridge , willing away her insatiable craving to blow up his kitchen . Keep it together , Theresa . You can handle this . She let out a deep breath that was a little too smoky for comfort , then marched over to the phone and punched the speed dial . Again . And again , his answering machine came on . " Quincy ! It 's Theresa . I have n't eaten in two days and I 'm starving . I know you do n't care about me or the Goblet , but your brother 's now the Assistant Guardian , in case you forgot . He 'll kick your butt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mona has been stolen because you let the Interim Guardian die of starvation while you were obsessing about some stupid math equation that no one but you cares about . And the Council will skewer you if you screw up Guardianship . Literally . " She paused to take a breath , forcing herself not to shudder at the thought of the Council , the ruthless governing body in charge of the Guardians and the Goblet . Guardians who screwed up were seriously toast , even Interim Guardians . " And if you do n't get home with food in thirty minutes , I 'm burning down your house and moving in with Becca . " She slammed down the phone and glared at the Goblet of Eternal Youth , which was currently masquerading as an espresso machine . " Mona ! This is all your fault . " The espresso machine said nothing . Of course it would n't . In two hundred years , Mona had never so much as hinted at being sorry for turning Theresa permanently into dragon form . Yeah , yeah , so Theresa was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eternal Youth , but was n't it the Goblet 's duty to warn her that a sip while in dragon form would keep her that way forever ? Apparently not . Theresa yanked open the freezer and stared at the contents . Empty . She supposed she could eat some more ice cubes . She 'd at least be hydrated when she died of starvation . Bonus . Or maybe she could eat some chairs . Nothing wrong with fiber , right ? Now that Justine , her best friend , roomie , and personal servant for the last two hundred years , was off on her honeymoon , it was all too apparent what kind of a life Theresa had : none . No job . No social life . No friends . And most important , no way to get food . She slammed the door shut as her stomach rumbled again and a burning sensation clawed at her belly . She 'd bet a box of Vic 's Pretzels that her body was beginning to eat itself . Would n't that be a fun way to die ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death ! Dying of starvation was completely unacceptable . Dammit ! She slammed her tail against the fridge , too hungry to bother checking to see if she 'd left a dent . She was n't even allowed to order delivery because she was guarding Mona , and it was a big no-no to have strangers parading up to the door when the Goblet of Eternal Youth was hiding out . You never knew if the skinny little delivery boy might be packing a sword in his stay-hot pizza bag . Plus , how was she supposed to explain her appearance when she answered the door ? No , you 're not really seeing an emaciated eleven-foot dragon with gold eyes . It 's the scent from the pizza causing your hallucinations . Yeah , right . She stalked over to the window of Quincy 's house and stared at the darkened suburb . If she were in her own condo , she could probably get Xavier the doorman to get her some food , but no , their condo was still a shambles after Justine and Derek had gotten a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For a moment , she considered calling Becca , Satan 's favorite Rivka and right-hand badass , but finally dismissed it . The Rivka had more important things to do than bring carryout to a dragon , and Theresa had too much pride to beg . She closed her eyes and dug her claws into the windowsill . You are not hungry . You are not lonely . You are a goddess . The shattering of the wood jerked her back to the present , and she jerked her claws away from the window . Even the house was n't built for helping a dragon through the throes of misery . There was only one thing that would help her now . One man . If Zeke was n't online , heaven help her and the neighborhood she was hiding out in . She grabbed her computer and IM 'd Zeke , the only man she 'd had cybersex with in the last six months . Six months of monogamy for Theresa Nichols , former Queen of the Sluts . Astounding , was n't it ? Just proved how good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragon who was completely deprived of all other outlets was quite the feat . Thank God for Zeke . " Zeke ? You there ? " she typed . His reply was instant . " Yep . You ? " Tension eased from her body at his immediate response and she smiled , imagining what his voice must sound like . Deep . Manly . He probably had thick whiskers that would make a woman tremble with longing . Zeke was definitely a badass . She could sense the undercurrent of violence in him . She loved bad boys . What dragon would n't ? Whoever she dated had to be able to deal with a girl who liked to burn things up and ate six pizzas for an afternoon snack . " I bought a new piece of lingerie off the Internet yesterday . Want me to describe it ? " Silence . She frowned at his hesitation , and an anxiety spark shot out of her nose and sizzled on the keyboard . " Zeke ? Do n't leave me hanging . Not tonight . " He finally typed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet . " She jerked upright in Quincy 's microfiber recliner , slamming the footrest back to the floor with an ominous thud . " I ca n't meet you ! " She scowled as a wave of longing washed over her , smashing her claws onto the keyboard as she typed her response . " I 'm still in isolation at the FBI containment center , remember ? They have n't figured out how to keep my contagious disease from infecting everyone who comes within ten feet of me . " She felt a little guilty about the lie , but it was n't as if she could tell him she was a dragon . Besides , being locked up in an FBI containment facility was sort of dramatic and cool , and way better than her real life . " I think you 're avoiding me . " She grinned at his perceptiveness , imagining his brows furrowed in aggravation as he typed . " Tell that to the dude with the machine gun guarding my door . " " Give me his number and I 'll call him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his continued pressure . " He wo n't get close enough to talk to me . Afraid I 'll infect him . " " Is n't that convenient ? " Her tail switched at his thinly veiled sarcasm and she accidentally dropped a puff of ash onto Quincy 's hand-woven carpet from India . She 'd been fending off Zeke 's requests to meet for months , but something felt different tonight . Or maybe her perception of reality was being distorted by the fact that her stomach was beginning to eat her brain . " No , it 's not convenient . I 'd love to meet you in person and engage in some real flesh-to-flesh activities . " Understatement of the year . Cybersex was better than nothing , but it was no substitute for having a man wrapped around her . She 'd even had Justine buy her some of the aftershave Zeke said he wore , and she sprayed it around whenever they had cybersex . The woodsy , masculine scent was nearly enough to give her an orgasm on its own , let alone when Zeke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't sleep , she sprayed it on her pillow and pretended he was there , hugging her pillow to her chest . Not that she 'd admit that to anyone . Dragons did n't need nighttime comfort , and she was no exception . She was just sexually deprived and she loved to bask in the scent of the man of her fantasies . And if she liked it when he talked about his favorite movies and places he 'd like to take her on their first date , it was only because she was so desperately lonely for any kind of a real life , even if it was vicariously through Zeke . Not because she liked him or anything . Because that would be incredibly stupid , given her permanently scaly state . " Seriously , T , I do n't care about your infectious disease . I can buy a biohazard suit anywhere . We need to meet . " Theresa 's heart started to pound and her hind claws curled into the floor . Zeke was her one contact with the outside world . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Their wild and daring cybersex and late-night gossip sessions were the only outlet that kept her sane , since violence , gorging on food , and incineration were n't options . She took a deep breath and tried to focus . She had to reel him in before he ruined everything , before he demanded what she could n't give . " What 's the point in meeting if you 're wearing a biohazard suit ? We would n't be able to have sex . " His reply was quick , as if he 'd anticipated her answer . " I want to know what you look like . " She scowled . She was an eleven-foot winged dragon with bluish-green scales and golden eyes . Would that do it for him ? Doubted it . " Sorry . No pictures , remember ? " It had been so long since she 'd been in human form , she was n't sure she 'd even recognize herself . Silence . At his hesitation , Theresa shoved the computer off her lap and jumped to her feet , pacing past the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to burn up . Heat roiled through her , struggled to escape . A spark slipped out of her nose and landed on the hardwood floor . Crap ! She stomped it out , then spun back to face her computer when she heard it beep . She was afraid to read Zeke 's reply . After a moment she lifted her chin , straightened her tail , and marched back over to read what he 'd written . " I think maybe it 's time to change the rules . " She growled at the screen . There could be no rule-changing ! Face-to-face meetings were not happening ! " T ? You still there ? I 'm serious . Things need to change . I ca n't keep this up . " How dare he ruin the only decent thing in her life by demanding something she could n't give , no matter how much she might want to ? She would n't let him . Not tonight . " The scientists are here to run more tests on me . Got ta run . " She hesitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body . " Then she disconnected before he could reply . She slammed the lid closed on her laptop and stomped across the room , ignoring the pictures rattling on the walls . Well , would n't that be fine and dandy ? Not only was she starving to death , but she would die alone and sexually frustrated because Zeke was about to bail on her . Forget it . Things had gone too far . A girl had her limits . She smashed her hip into the kitchen door and shoved it open , ignoring the trickle of sparks that dropped on the tile . Quincy would just have to get over a few burn marks . He 'd be lucky if she did n't burn down his house by accident . She narrowed her eyes at the espresso machine . " I have to eat , which means it 's time for a highly illegal field trip . And you 're coming with me , since I ca n't leave you behind unprotected . " She picked up the espresso machine and tried to tuck it under her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't exactly in top flying shape . " I do n't suppose you could turn into something smaller and easier to carry ? " The espresso machine did n't so much as flicker . " What if I take you on a flying tour of the New York City skyline so you can see this city that you 've been living in for the last five years ? " Mona immediately changed into an ankle bracelet . Theresa grinned , all too familiar with the desperation Mona would be feeling at being locked in her inanimate cell for so long . " That 's my girl . Maybe we can be friends after all . " At least there was something in this world that was more desperate than she was . Forty-five minutes later , Theresa was perched on the roof of the Vic 's Pretzels that was down the street from the condo she used to live in . She was wearing her favorite come-hither outfit : a leather miniskirt , a black lace bra under a transparent white top , the topaz earrings she 'd bought during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dragons do n't have ears ? The scales located on the side of her head worked just fine ) , a new diamond stud in the piercing at the end of her tail , and , of course , her new ankle bracelet . She might not have any breasts or even a waist to do the outfit justice , and her blue scales were n't exactly sexy , but one should never underestimate the effect that sexy clothes can have on a woman 's mood . Or a dragon 's . She took a deep breath and inhaled the amazing scent of fresh dough rising , letting it soak into her lungs . Vic 's No-Carb Pretzels were her reason for living , definitely worth taking a forbidden trip out into the night air . The sounds of the humans working the ovens drifted up to her , and she took a moment to sort out their scents . There were at least three of them , two male and one female . Probably one person manning the kitchens and two customers getting their late-night pretzel fix . Unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three piles of human ash . She growled , realizing that food would have to suffice to appease her needs . If she could get the people outside for a few minutes ... She eyed the roof and found what she was looking for . Did n't anyone have the foresight to protect their vents from dragons anymore ? She glided over to the vent ( yes , she might weigh several tons , but that did n't mean she had to stop practicing the double-jointed-hips walk that had brought men to their knees two hundred years ago ) and pressed her face up to it . " Hope you all are wearing your gas masks . " Was n't this going to be fun ? She had n't tortured humans in forever . She grinned , rolled some smoke around in her chest for a moment , then expelled a huge black cloud into the vent . Then , for kicks , she did it again . The sound of coughing and the scent of human alarm drifted up to her , and Theresa flopped down on her belly and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual destruction , but it soaked into her pores and eased the desperation off her needs . It took less than three minutes for the humans to vacate the premises . Once they were hacking away out front , she sat up , shook off the soothing effects of the assault , and coasted down to the back door . She tugged on it , found it locked , then grinned with delight and yanked it free , along with the doorframe . She tossed the still-locked unit into the alley and scooted inside the kitchen of Vic 's Pretzels . Three feet inside the door , she was hit by the intense aroma of baking dough and melted butter and fell flat on her face . Holy mother of pearl . She groaned and rolled onto her back , drinking in the heavenly odors . Cinnamon . Fresh bread . Melted frosting for the dessert pretzels . Her claws curved against her chest and she closed her eyes , inhaling deeply as euphoria slackened her muscles , slowed her heart rate . She would never move again . Just lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she shook her head , trying to clear it . This was n't a safe environment . She should n't be sprawled on the floor . She tried to uncurl her claws , but she was too relaxed , too overcome by lassitude . ( Continues ... ) by Stephanie Rowe
