It 's a pleasant kind of humming . Happy , unself-conscious , slightly flighty and more than a little girly . It comes out whenever I halt the conversation to scribble in my notebook to catch up . And when I run out of the restaurant to feed the parking meter , she grabs the pad and writes , " Note to self : buy Felicity presents . " She giggles and touches my arm and asks me lots of questions about myself . If all that were n't femme enough , she refers to herself by her nickname , Flicka ; points out her favorite knitting store across the street ; and admits that the night before , she ran out of gas on Mulholland Drive and cried until her husband came to pick her up . I am worried she is going to try to braid my hair and choreograph a dance routine for us . <P> So it 's even more impressive that the woman in the thin purple dress , drinking chai and wearing makeup and nail polish in various shades of pink , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the process of becoming a woman , in Transamerica , a low-budget indie film about a transsexual father 's road trip with her newly discovered teenage prostitute son . If people thought it was brave of Nicole Kidman to endanger her glamour by wearing a big prosthetic nose or Charlize Theron to put on fake teeth , Huffman is going to get the silver star . In one scene , for longer and in larger form than you might enjoy , her penis is visible . <P> " The Oscar talk is starting now , " says Marc Cherry , creator and executive producer of Desperate Housewives , for which Huffman won an Emmy for playing an ad exec turned frustrated stay-at-home mom . " People are starting to use the O word with Felicity  --  which upsets me because it would mean we 'll have to pay her more .

But the most impressive thing is how , a few minutes into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start to focus on the character . Not that the external stuff is n't impressive . Her voice is man low , she walks like a guy in drag , and she gestures just like a guy who desperately wants to hide his masculinity . " I said to her , ' You do n't have big hands , but they look big in every shot . How do you do that ? ' " says Duncan Tucker , Transamerica 's first-time feature writer and director . " She said , ' I move them like they 're underwater . ' " <P> The voice took an hour of practice to slip into each morning , so she stuck with it off camera all day . It was so convincing that Huffman 's husband , actor William H. Macy , who served as a producer on the project , would n't take her calls during the day because it creeped him out . " My 2-year-old did cry when she saw me , " said Huffman . " It 's probably something she 'll be talking about in therapy .

" People in show business have been waiting for her to be a star for a long time , " says Cherry . " She 's so down to earth and humble , you get the feeling she does n't see herself that way .
