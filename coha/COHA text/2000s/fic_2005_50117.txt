When we published " The Gist Hunter " in our June 2005 issue , it looked as though that would be the last we 'd see of Henghis Hapthorn for a while . So it was an unexpected pleasure when we received this story filling us in on Hapthorn 's youth and explaining how he started on the path to becoming the foremost freelance discriminator of Old Earth . Mr. Hughes reports from his home in British Columbia that his novel Black Brillion is enjoying good reviews and that he is currently at work on several new writing projects , some of which we hope to bring you soon . <p> IN MY SENIOR YEAR AT THE Institute , I found a friend in Torsten Olabian , a sunny-tempered young man who shared my enthusiasm for the sport of pinking . We would regularly meet at the practice range to skim small , eight-pointed stars at wooden targets propelled in various directions by an attendant 's catapult . Olabian was skilled with either hand and it was a rare disk that did not tumble from the air pierced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I soon grew bored after mastering the throws and postures . I would have abandoned the pursuit if I had not discovered an ability to strike the targets from the air while blindfolded . " How is it done ? " Olabian wanted to know when I had just brought down my fifth disk in a row though my head was swathed in a lightless hood . I had always found it difficult to explain how I did such things . " I call it simply insight , " I said . " One just knows where target and star will meet . All that is then required is to bring the two objects together at that point and moment . " " It sounds easy , " he said . " Indeed , " I said . " I find it much easier to do than to explain . It is the same with the facility with which I resolve conundrums that others find impenetrable . " " That is a useful ability . Perhaps you should consider a career as a discriminator . " I made a noise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at large , " I said . " Most doubtful . " Yet even as I said it I felt a contrary vote from deeper inside me . I then confessed to Torsten what I had told no one else . " I am able to do these mental tricks with the aid of some other part of me , one that is lodged in the more remote regions of my psyche . I can not assert control over it , though it yields remarkable results if I offer acceptance and collaboration . " " I wonder if I have such a part ? " Torsten said . " If you do , it might be best to leave it undisturbed . " My being able to hit a pinking target while blindfolded was but the latest manifestation of the odd capabilities my " other part " had demonstrated since childhood . During my adolescence I tried to understand or at least delineate the peculiarities I had discovered in myself , but my efforts met with frustration and at last I gave up . Grown to young manhood I found myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front parlors of my mind - no better than most of my peers at using formal logic to analyze situations and work through syllogisms to a rational conclusion . In the numeric disciplines my studies at the Institute were teaching me how to apply higher level consistencies , the recondite procedures which underlay the mathematics of chaos , and I was making adequate progress . Yet , beyond the normal development of my intellect , there was always the sense that another person lived , for the most part unobtrusively , in the back of my mind . If I kept a problem only in my familiar front parlors I could worry at it for days " and still be baffled . But if I took the conundrum down the rearmost corridors of my consciousness and left it at the edge of darkness , in time - it might be moments , or hours , but rarely more than a day - a fully formed answer would appear . I had found that stilling my thoughts through an elementary variant of the Lho-tso exercises aided the process and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " applying insight " that it was now almost automatic . Faced with a puzzle that did not yield an easy or obvious solution , I need close my eyes for no more than a moment or two to know intuitively that the man down the backstairs - so I thought of him - was hard at work . I did not resent sharing my inner spaces with this anonymous prodigy , though I had not yet come to include him in my private definition of " me . " It was like having a brother who was reliable yet eccentric . The next time we met at the practice field , Torsten had just returned from a visit to The Hutch , his father 's estate near the hamlet of Binch , at the landward end of the long fingerlike peninsula that is tipped by the City of Olkney , which surrounds the Institute 's hallowed grounds . My friend 's normally blithe disposition was clouded and there was a grim set to the corners of his mouth . I needed no exceptional insight to say , " Something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told me that when he got to his father 's house he found it had acquired an additional resident . A man had arrived one day , declared himself to be fabbi Gloond , an old acquaintance of the master , and had moved in . " What is the problem ? " I asked . " They do not act as if they are on good terms . Gloond struts about as if he were the proprietor , commanding , " Bring me this/ and " Fetch me more/ while my father remains as still as a small creature that has fallen under a predator 's eye . " " What does your father say about this ? " " Nothing . He has never been the most forthcoming of parents . I 've always believed it was because he was absent for the years of my infancy . We are on civil terms but not close , a relationship that has always suited us both . When I try to question him about Gloond , he makes abstracted motions with his hands and changes the subject . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insight ? " " It would be premature to say , " I said . But I accepted his invitation to accompany him down to Binch at the next hiatus . In the meantime , I decided to assemble as much information as I could about Jabbi Gloond and Gresh Olabian , Torsten 's father . Oddly enough , my friend could be of little aid in this endeavor . " We do not talk much , " he said . " The old man has always kept to himself and sometimes does not come out of his chamber for days at a time . I know that he made a small fortune on Bain , a remote planet in the Back of Beyond . He mined for gems , mainly blue-fires and shatter-lights . " " And this Gloond dates from those times ? " " So it would seem . " Back in my room , I consulted the Institute 's integrator . There was almost no information on Gloond ; he hailed from Orkham County , a rigorously bucolic district on Bain 's southern continent that had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who disdained all mechanical and artificial contrivances more complex than hand tools and unpowered conveyances . Whatever records Orkham Country may have kept had never been made part of the connectivity matrix that extended across Old Earth and out to all the major human settled worlds along the Spray . About all that was known about Jabbi Gloond was that he had alighted at the Olkney space port some weeks before , having worked his passage from Bain on a tramp freighter . I then asked the Institute 's integrator about Gresh Olabian and uncovered a richer vein of information . Olabian was orphaned at an early age but had overcome his handicaps ; after taking a certificate in the building and operating of mines , he had gone out to the Spray to make his fortune , leaving behind an infant son . No female parent was mentioned , though that was not unusual . In such cases one did not inquire . Gresh Olabian had worked for a number of mining consortia on various worlds , until he had acquired enough savings to undertake his own venture : a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shatterlights . The gems never occurred in surface deposits , I learned from the integrator . Because they were a temporary offshoot of vulcanism on Bain and similar worlds , they must be dug for in profound strata that were often unstable . The preferred methodology was to bore in deep and quickly , using shielded mass converters , retrieve the gems and be out before the disturbed rock violently rearranged itself . Yet that sort of machinery was forbidden to cross the Orkham County border . " How did he develop the mine ? " I asked . " Olabian used ingenuity , " said the integrator . " He assembled a work force from several planets : Gryulls did the digging ; a trio of footed worms from Ek hauled away the broken rock , guided by their symbiotic handlers ; members of a modified human species known as Halebs operated the chemical works that separated the pure blue-fires from the matrix ; there was even a transmuting Shishisha to insinuate itself into the thinnest crevices , seeking out the best gems and thus avoiding unnecessary excavating . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olabian diggings , but I could imagine the scene : the heavy-shouldered Gryulls punching their way deep into Bain 's rocky meat , the long , armored multipedes with rocks heaped on their backs and their Ek wranglers seated just aft of the cranial sensorium , licking their fingers , then stroking the worms " feathery antennae with a unique saliva whose chemistry soothed the beasts " testy natures , the Shishisha assuming a flowing granular form that would let it fluidly slip into cracks . It conjured up a remarkable set of mental images , made even more extraordinary when I considered the fact that none of the species Olabian had assembled were noted for leaving their home worlds . Even the Halebs preferred to remain in their own habitats , finding not enough carbon dioxide in the atmosphere of worlds hospitable to unmodified humans . The integrator could offer no explanation , only conjectures . " They did not publicly discuss their motives ; therefore there is no record in the primary sources . Perhaps Olabian was a singularly persuasive recruiter , perhaps he promised rewards that overcame his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been banished from their home worlds , offering them shares in the venture which would have let them live large in exile . " In any case , " the integrator continued , " his plans came amiss . Shortly after the mine began production , disaster struck : a tunnel collapsed , entombing all except Olabian himself , who happened to be at the surface expediting a shipment of gems to market . He quite reasonably abandoned the venture , coming back to Old Earth with only enough profit to purchase a small estate . To The Hutch he brought his son , and there they dwelt quietly until the boy was sent off to school . " I then examined Olabian 's history since his return to Old Earth but found nothing of note . He had become a recluse , living alone in the manor . Torsten went earlier than most boys to a residential school , though that was not in itself an uncommon circumstance . I , myself , had gained most of my education in such places , my father having declared in my seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him once too often on some trifling matter , I applied insight to the data and felt a faint tickle at the back of my mind , but nothing concrete emerged . I decided it would be best to take a closer look at the situation that had caused Torsten to worry . In the meantime , I tasked the Institute 's integrator with amassing , from secondary and tertiary sources , all the information it could glean about the events in Orkham County . " That may take some time , " it said . " Several hours at least , perhaps even days . It will require an open inquiry on a number of worlds and there is no guarantee that persons who have the information - supposing they even exist - will be inclined to respond . " " Nevertheless , " I said and sent the integrator about its work . AT TORSTEN 'S URGING I took a hiatus from my studies and returned with him to The Hutch . We traveled by balloon-tram to Binch , then descended to hire an aircar that carried us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we spiraled down and saw that they were well tended , although I noticed that all work was being carried out by self-guiding devices . When we alighted at the front doors , no servant came to admit us ; instead , the who's-there mounted on a pillar of the portico notified the house integrator and the doors automatically swung open . " Where is my father ? " Torsten asked as soon as we had entered . A voice from the air informed us that Gresh Olabian was sequestered in his chambers . " Is he unwell ? " my friend asked . " He does not say . He has asked not to be disturbed . " I was intrigued . " Can you not deduce his condition from observation ? " I said . The integrator replied , " My percepts were removed from the private chambers shortly after the master 's return from the stars . " " Indeed ? " I said . I could not recall encountering anyone who shut himself away from his own integrator . It was an unusual state of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " My father is of an intensely private disposition , " Torsten said . " I used to try to engage him in discussions appropriate between a son and a father , but he would soon run out of things to say and would retire to his suite . " I would have pursued the issue further , but at that moment a door to an adjacent room opened and another person entered the foyer . From the way Torsten stiffened , I knew this to be Jabbi Gloond . He was an unprepossessing fellow , past his middle years , with a chin that descended too far toward his chest and a wandering forehead that ranged almost to the crown of his skull . Between them was a nose the shape and texture of some root vegetable . His eyes were large and moist and I suspected that his lower lip only made contact with its upper neighbor when he was speaking , being left the rest of the time to hang as loose as an untucked shirttail . He offered Torsten a tepid greeting without stopping , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his honking nasal voice instructing the integrator to prepare a plate of pickled mushrooms stuffed with spiced eggs . I would admit to myself , though not to Torsten , that I had expected something else : a swaggering bravo , a coldly imperious enforcer , a sly sidlcr . " He does not seem the type to intimidate a master miner , " I said . " You would think so , " my friend answered , " but my father clearly lost his verve on Bain . He was never quite himself again . " I was shown to a large , airy chamber on the second floor , across from Torsten 's favorite room when he was at home . The elder Olabian 's suite occupied one end of another wing , down a wide aisle that led off from the corridor where our accommodations were . I asked where Jabbi Gloond slept and was told that he had a small space on the ground floor where he could reach the kitchens with the fewest steps . " He has an unending appetite for delicacies , " Torsten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , faithful to the strictures of the Palmadyan CuItx subsisted on rude fare . I was sure it was wholesome , but no doubt some found it tiresome over a lifetime . I asked if Gloond had made any other demands . Torsten knew of none . " The fellow seems to desire no more than to sleep late in a soft bed , consume copious quantities of dainties and have his intimate needs seen to by the personal apparatus in his room . " " Palmadyans are not renowned for sophistication , " I said . " For Jabbi Gloond , such a regime as he now follows may approximate paradise . He has made no demands for funds ? No suggestions about redrawing a will ? " " Not so far . Comfort and opportunities for indolence seem to be his desired goals , and here he has achieved them . " I was puzzled . Jabbi Gloond seemed to be no more trouble than any house guest who slips and ducks every hint that his optimum departure date has passed . Yet Gresh Olabian was reportedly ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but received only vague impressions . " Anything ? " said Torsten , who had seen me perform before . " Premature , " I said , " though I hope you will not be offended if I speculate that Gloond causes your father discomfort because he knows something that your father would rather no one knew . " " That is an obvious line of inquiry , " my friend agreed . " But when I ask the old man if there is something he wishes to tell me , he retires to his rooms without a word . " We took luncheon in the great refectory . The Hutch 's integrator was a superior model and provided a fine repast . Torsten , his father and I sat at one end of the long , grand table , while Jabbi Gloond occupied the farthest extreme , trenchering his way through mounds of roast vegetables and succulent meats . A strong odor of spice and pungent herbs emanated from the loaded salvers that appeared before him and he wielded his cutlery with a clattering brio that prevented his hearing our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloond a lapsed Palmadyan , " I said . " The cult requires its adherents to eat only what they have grown and prepared themselves , a stricture only slightly modified by the fact that all effort in Orkham County is communal . " " Not only communal but compulsory , " said Torsten . " I think you have used too mild a term for the manner in which our guest has departed from the cult 's teachings . He has not so much lapsed from Palmadyanism as leapt from it as far as humanly possible . " Torsten and I had agreed on this conversational gambit as a means to make a sideways approach to the question on the son 's mind . We would lure the father into an exchange that we intended to shape toward a discussion of how he and Gloond came to be sharing a house . " Indeed , " I said , following Torsten 's observation with a question to the older man . " You have seen Orkham County at first hand . Is Jabbi Gloond as atypical as he seems ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reply and with pale , seemingly bloodless hands continued to pick without interest at a plate of herbs and softroot . Undeterred , I bored in . " Although you used offworld labor to mine for blue-fires and shatterlights , you must have engaged local transportation and handlers to get them to the spaceport on Shoal Island . Only horsedrawn wagons can cross Orkham County , and the drivers are all local folk . Was Gloond one of them ? " He made no reply , but this time Olabian looked at me . Although the waxy skin of his face did not register any emotion I thought I saw alarm in his otherwise expressionless eyes . My interest in Gloond appeared to disturb him . It clearly emboldened Torsten . " If he is causing you difficulties , we 'll soon tumble him out into the road , " he said . The elder Olabian said nothing and kept his eyes on his plate . " Please , Father , " said Torsten , " Henghis is very good at unraveling mysteries . I have urged him to become a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he can help . We 'll get to the bottom of Jabbi Gloond . " Again , though no expression animated the father 's face , I sensed a growing unease . But when I began to frame a new question , Gresh Olabian rose from the table without a word and departed the room . Torsten watched his father go , his face a turmoil of frustration mingled with heartfelt concern . At the other end of the table Jabbi Gloond paid no heed but continued to feed his apparently unrelenting appetite . " Hmm , " I said . In the long summer afternoon , the old orange sun poured its tinted light through the trailing branches of a broad-holed dwindle that dominated the estate 's south lawn . I had convinced Torsten that a round of pinking might take his mind off the situation . But when I came out with my stars in hand I found that my friend had prevailed , I do n't know how , on Jabbi Gloond to operate the apparatus that flung the targets . We spun our stars at the disks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friend 's mind was not upon the game . He clean missed an easy low-glide in the first frame and barely nicked a high tumbler in the second . As the fallen Palmadyan reloaded the catapult and reset its randomizer for the third interval , Torsten said , " Let us question him about his comings and doings . Perhaps he will let something slip . " I felt a stirring in the back of my mind , my other part stretching its intellectual tendons in anticipation of a pursuit . But some other region of my divided psyche made its influence felt and I said , " I am not sure there is anything to be gained by pushing into the thicket of secrets that your father and Jabbi Gloond share . " Torsten 's brow darkened . " But obviously he is extorting favors from my father . " " Indeed , " I said , " but they are trivial : some plates of spiced mushrooms and a narrow chamber that was intended for an undercook . " " Details ! My father is victimized ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ situation . He did not become disturbed until you spoke of my ability to penetrate an intrigue . " There was a sensation in my own back rooms , an inner grumble that told me that my inward companion was not pleased at the direction into which I was trying to move events . There was an even more forceful protest from the friend beside me . " I must know what is going on , " Torsten said . With that he made a peremptory gesture that caused Jabbi Gloond to slouch in our direction . " Unpleasant knowledge is like an ugly but unreturnable gift , " I quoted . " Once received it must be lived with . " Torsten struck a resolute pose . " Nevertheless . " " Very well , " I said , " but allow me to put the questions . " At close quarters , the former Palmadyan was even less prepossessing . The comprehensive traces of several meals adorning the front of his smock were as much an affront to the nose as to the eye . I examined his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found nothing remarkable . Nor were there indications of even moderate intelligence . Any illicit enterprise conceived by Jabbi Gloond , I decided , would be uncomplicated and its execution probably confined to a single stage . A two-step plan would be one too many . " You are of Orkham County , I believe , " I said . " Yes . " " A remarkable place , Orkham , " I said . " Is it ? " For a moment I thought to detect repartee , then I saw that the man was genuinely puzzled by my observation . While the sparse teeth of his mental gears were still grinding I threw him a direct question . " Did you work for Gresh Olabian there ? " " No . " " Then for whom ? " " For Farmer Boher . " " What did you do for Farmer Boher ? " " Drove a wagon . " " It must have been a good and simple life , full of fresh air and healthful exercise . " He shook his elongated head so vigorously that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad , work was hard . Slept in the barn . " I understood that Jabbi Gloond had spent a lifetime doing what he was bidden to do . Asked a question , it was his reflex to answer it . Still , he was no running fount of conversation - more like a slowly dripping tap . But by patience and careful questioning I achieved an elementary view of his former situation . The Olabian diggings had been on Farmer Boher 's land and Jabbi Gloond was the hand detailed to carry goods and persons to and from the mine site in the wagon . He had had only perfunctory contact with the mining party . " Were you there when the accident happened ? " I asked . " Where ? " " At the mine ? " Now I saw craftiness mixed with apprehension blossom in his aspect , the sentiments as obvious as the open-pored tuber that was his facial centerpiece . " No , " he said . " You were n't there when the shaft collapsed ? " " No . " Now there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had asked the wrong question and that he was glad of it . Insight came unbidden . " But you were there after ? " He looked away . " Do n't remember . " " What did you see ? " " Nothing . Tunnel caved in . Was nothing to see . " I wanted to ask more but it now belatedly dawned on Jabbi Gloond that he was not obliged to satisfy my curiosity . He turned and sloped off toward the house . " He was lying , " Torsten said . " Yes , " I said , " but only a little . " " What do you deduce ? " I let the impression filter up from within . " Something to do with the accident . He knows something about your father 's involvement . It can not have been anything abstruse or Jabbi Gloond would have failed to notice it . " " Something as simple as my father 's having caused the cave-in to rob the others of their shares ? " " Did the others have shares to be robbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gresh Olabian was clearly not the warmest of men , but I did not sense in him the coldness of spirit that would be needed if he were to murder an entire mining crew . " And if he did , " I said , " why would a troublesome Jabbi Gloond still have all his particles in place ? He would make a small addition to the death roll . There are plenty of corners on the estate where his ashes might be tossed into the breeze . " " We need more information , " Torsten said . I reluctantly agreed , though again I counseled him to let the matter lie . " I sense no great evil here , " I said . " Nor has your father asked for my help . " " But I have , " was his reply , " and as my friend you are bound to provide it . " I could think of nothing to offer in response so I said , " Let us go see if the Institute 's integrator has anything to report . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and banished criminals , " the Institute 's integrator reported when we used the communications nexus in The Hutch 's study to make contact . It was an unimpressive room , containing only the commonest books and most of them were uncracked . The family connaissarium contained few relics or mementos , considering that Gresh Olabian had spent so many years offworld . " The Gryulls , " the integrator continued , " were from a minor sept of a warrior clan that had chosen the losing side in a voluntary prestige war involving several of the Umpteen Nations . " " I am not familiar with the Umpteen Nations , " I said . " ' Umpteen " is the closest translation of the Gryull term . The next closest is " More than anyone cares to count . " The species 's numerical system only goes up to eight , that is , the equivalent of two four-fingered Gryull hands . After that come words for " quite a few/ " many/ and the term I translated as " Umpteen . ' " " I take it that mathematical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indeed . " " Please go on , " I said . " The Gryulls were posted offworld for two cycles while they discharged their ... " - again there was an untranslatable term that the integrator rendered as second degree shame with liability for mild ridicule - " ... after which they could have returned home and resumed their careers . " " Were they close to a return ? " " They were , from a Gryull 's perspective . They are far longer lived and thus generally more patient than humans . " " What about the Ek and their walking worms ? " I said . " Two of them were criminals of moderate notoriety according to their culture 's norms . The other seems to have been some kind of cousin or a debt servant . Perhaps both . They fled offworld to avoid punishment . " " The Shishisha ? " I asked . The answer was vague , that species being notoriously unforthcoming about their laws and customs . " There are indirect allusions to its having assumed one of the Seven Proscribed Forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I 'm reading the term right ; another interpretation is " ineligible for cannibalization . " Or it could be that both translations are correct - little is known of the means by which Shishisha conduct their intimacies . " " AndtheHalebs ? " " They seem to have been motivated primarily by the shares that Gresh Olabian offered for their participation in the project . " " Ah , " I said , " so he was dividing the proceeds . " " Yes , " said the integrator , " though not until the mine 's decommissioning , to keep the work force together . All stood to gain substantially , at least according to their own cultural definitions of " gain " and " substantial . ' " " So no one had a motive to destroy the enterprise before it produced great wealth ? " " None that I can ascertain . Solitary Eks sometimes go berserk from loneliness . However , the three in this case not only had each other but , even more important to their psychological health , they had their symbiotic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or at least the state is conjectured to be despair . It is characterized by inertia but no one ever knows what a Shishisha thinks or feels , if the terms are even appropriate . " " And the cause of the shaft 's collapse ? " " The region is volcanic and unstable , " said the integrator , displaying a map of Orkham County marked with faults and magma chambers . " Since the disaster there have been a number of serious upheavals in the same area . " " Are there images ? " I asked but was not surprised to be told there were none . The integrator reproduced the texts of official reports on the incident and the results of a more recent geological survey of the area . A footnote mentioned the old mine cave-in . I felt a stirring in the back of my mind . A picture appeared on my inner screen and after I had considered it for a few moments I told Torsten , " I believe that all this may soon take on a recognizable shape . " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with more intellect than personality wields logic like a lancet to slice through layers of subterfuge and diversion to discover the pulsing truth . As a young man , however , I was familiar with the tropes . One of the standard ploys was for the discriminator to announce to the assembled suspects that the mystery had been solved and all would now be revealed . Invariably , this declaration led to the lights going out while the villain took flight or , more usually , attempted to murder the sleuth before his guilt could be uncovered . My reading of the situation at The Hutch was that such a declaration would signal to Jabbi Gloond that his days of easy living were about to find their sunset . He would then depart - I judged him not to be the type that would opt for violent tactics - and life among the Olabians would return to its previous indifferent tranquillity . Accordingly , when we regathered in the refectory for dinner , between the soup and the ragout I flourished a copy of the printed information the Institute 's integrator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now solved . I have studied the reports from Orkham County and I know what happened . " I then turned a withering stare on Jabbi Gloond . Unfortunately , his attention had been consumed by his efforts to scrape the last drops of broth from his bowl and over the noise of his spoon he had not heard what I had said . I called his name and when his moist eyes rotated in my direction , I repeated my statement . I watched his reaction carefully and saw a succession of moods flutter across the long dullness of his face : first came puzzlement , then cogitation as he worked at what I had said , followed by the dawn of realization as he grasped its import , and finally a mask of sad resignation , accompanied by a slump of his bony shoulders . " There are just a few more facts to be added , details of legalisms and entitlements , " I said , embroidering the fabric of my falsehood to heighten the effect on Jabbi Gloond . " I shall have them in the morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gloond 's shoulders fell further . I looked across the table at Torsten 's triumphant smile . The son turned to the unwanted guest and said , " Depart by any door you choose , or face the consequences . " Gresh Olabian , meanwhile , said nothing , nor did his expression change . His eyes remained on his plate and his pallid fingers rested immobile beside it . I examined him closely and confirmed my earlier intuition . I believed I knew what had happened on Bain . The lights did not go out . Instead we were served five-flesh stew . Torsten ate his with more gusto than Jabbi Gloond . It was the happiest I ever saw my friend . His father sipped a few morsels from a spoon and when he thought I was not looking regarded me with a brief , expressionless stare . I turned and offered him a reassuring smile . He would not meet my eyes but looked down again at his plate . After dinner , Torsten and I played pick-and-ponder in the study while the two other inhabitants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoky liqueur Torsten asked me , " Do you really know all ? " " I believe so . " " Then tell me . " " It would be premature ... , " I began , but he cut me off , demanding that I disclose what I knew . I demurred . " I only suspect , " I said . " And if in the morning , Jabbi Gloond is gone , then you will have the result you sought . The Hutch will again become as you have always known it and you can let matters lie . " " I can not believe that my father did anything discreditable . " " That is an appropriate attitude for a good son who has a good father . I believe the situation on Bain was unique and involved desperate circumstances . It need not be spoken of . " " But what about the secret ? " " Obviously it is something your father does not wish anyone to know . I believe that " anyone " includes you , perhaps especially you . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I merely suspect , " I said again . " And if in the morning Jabbi Gloond is gone , I will rise and depart in his wake without speaking of it . Then all of this can be forgotten . " Late in the evening we retired . Although I still did not suspect the worst of Jabbi Gloond I locked my chamber door and set a chair against the opener . I left a small lumen aglow on a nightstand and got into bed . I turned the facts and my conclusions over in my head one last time , then turned myself over and fell asleep . I came awake in complete darkness . I lay without moving , breathing as quietly as I could through my open mouth , listening . Something had awakened me but now the room was without noise . The silence extended , second after second , while I heard only my own pulse throbbing in my ears . Then there came a whisper , nearby and off to my right , the faintest sound of a soft sole touching carpet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed to the night table on my left and reached through the blackness for the pinking stars I had left there after my game with Torsten . Applying insight , I spun a star as I would when blindfolded . I heard it strike home , a meaty thunk followed by a hiss . Then came sounds of motion receding . I leapt from the bed and felt for the nightstand . When I activated the lumen , its glow revealed that I was alone in the chamber , with furniture still set against the latch . I threw the chair aside , unlocked the door and stepped out into the corridor to find it empty . A moment later , a tousled Torsten appeared in sleeping attire from his quarters , rubbing his eyes and inquiring what was the matter . I told him that there was nothing that need concern him . His eyes dropped to a spot just inside the door to my room . There lay a pinking star , one of its points glistening with dark liquid . " Gloond ! " Torsten said and flung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " I called after him but he paid no heed . I could only follow . Gloond 's cubby beside the kitchens was empty , the bed unslept in . " Integrator , " Torsten called . " Where is Jabbi Gloond ? " " Gone , " came the answer . " He packed and caught the last jitney to Binch . " " No , " said Torsten . " His departure is a ruse and he has returned to do us ill . Even now he may be entering my father 's rooms with foul intent . " I put my hand on his arm and shook him gently . " How could Jabbi Gloond contrive to enter my locked room then , having sustained an injury , escape in seconds through the still barricaded door ? " Torsten tore himself away . " I do not know . " He spoke to the integrator . " Where is my father ? " " In his chambers , I believe . " " I must see that he is all right , " Torsten said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All will be well . " But again he paid me no heed and reluctantly I followed him to the end of the corridor in the far wing . He touched the door control and when it would not open , he ordered the integrator to override the mechanism . The door slid aside and Torsten strode through the sitting room to his father 's private bedchamber . He called for every lumen to be activated , and the sudden flood of brightness chased all shadows from the room . The great bed occupied the center of the space , and its center was occupied by a motionless , amorphous shape beneath the bedding . " Father ! " Torsten cried , and before I could stop him he pulled back the covers . Gresh Olabian 's face was expressionless . His blank eyes looked up at us and then he slowly blinked . But our gazes were drawn first to the center of the pale forehead where , like a third eye , a deep puncture was slowly filling itself in , and then to what lay where his body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought you , " Torsten said . " I understand , " I said . " I did try to keep you from discovering what I suspected had happened on Bain . " " You should have tried harder . " We were seated in the study . The geological survey notes were spread across a table . They told how less than a year ago another volcanic upheaval had rearranged the rocks into which the Olabian mine had burrowed . A deep crack now led down to where the mining party had been trapped . The footnote reported that someone had been sent down to place the ceremonial objects with which Palmadyans marked informal graves . I was certain that someone had been Jabbi Gloond . He would have seen the unmistakable evidence of what had happened years before . Most of the miners had suffered death or near-fatal crushing injuries in the first moments of the cave-in . But a small space had remained , enough for the badly hurt Gresh Olabian and the only other member of his party left alive . Jabbi Gloond 's slow mind would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened after the cave-in than the instant leap accomplished the night before by that other Henghis Hapthorn who shared my mind . But eventually the Palmadyan would work it out . Then he would see in the secret that had been hidden below ground an opportunity to live the life he had come to crave once he had tasted - no doubt surreptitiously-the exotic foods that he hauled to Gresh Olabian 's mining camp from the spaceport . He had worked his way back to Old Earth , scrubbing decks and latrines on a third-rate freighter , dreaming of an unending feast of spiced eggs and pickled mushrooms . I looked at the geological survey notes and again I could envision Gresh Olabian and the other survivor making their agreement . Olabian was dying . He was desperate not to leave his infant son orphaned as he had been orphaned . So he transferred to the other all rights in the venture 's earnings and the information needed to exercise them . In return , the surviving partner would see that Torsten would have a home and a father to give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other waited for Olabian to die , then it performed a necessary act upon the dead man 's body before slipping through cracks and fissures , none of them thicker than a man 's thumb , to reach the surface . There the Shishisha assumed Gresh Olabian 's likeness , wearing clothes from the mining man 's tent as well as what it had brought up with it from the collapsed tunnel . When Jabbi Gloond came with the wagon , the facsimile of Gresh Olabian rode it to the spaceport and departed Bain . Now the study door opened and the entity Torsten Olabian had called father for most of his life came into the room . The wound in Gresh Olabian 's forehead was almost completely healed ; the interaction between the Shishisha 's fluid surface and the skin it had long ago flensed from Gresh Olabian 's head and hands aided rapid recovery . I suspected that by now it had so integrated with the alien flesh that it could not remove them . Torsten looked at the Shishisha and said , " No need to continue the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , " said the Shishisha , in its dry , whispery voice , " I am true to the agreement . " I said , " You need not have worried about me . I would never have revealed the secret . I only said what I did to make Jabbi Gloond flee , since his knowledge of your true identity was his only hold on you . " The Shishisha inclined Gresh Olabian 's head . I took it as an apology and let it know that I harbored no ill will . I would not mention to the Bureau of Scrutiny that the creature 's faithfulness to its pact with Gresh Olabian had led it to slither under the door of my chamber with the aim of silencing me forever . " Still , " Torsten said , " I think you had better go , Henghis . " I knew from the tone of his voice that our friendship would not survive the revelation I had been instrumental in bringing about . It mattered not that I had done so unwillingly and only at his urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had happened many years ago on a far distant world signified nothing . I gathered my belongings but left the pinking stars behind . I would not play again . I waited with Torsten at the gate for the hired air-car , and when it arrived , our leave-taking was formal . Not long after my return to the Institute I learned that Torsten would not be rejoining its cloisters . He had gone offworld , leaving The Hutch to its solitary inhabitant 's sad exile . I was surprised to note that the message that brought news of his departure was accompanied by a substantial sum . I hope that you will not let the results of our unhappy association deter you from work for which you have an unsurpassed talent , it said , and that you will use these funds to set up as a discriminator . I believe the one with whom you share an intellect would enjoy that . I cleared my mind so I could put the question to the inhabitant of its darker passages . I received an immediate and fierce affirmation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a circumstance that had cost me a rare friendship . Torsten 's plan was as good as any other . I wound up my studies at the Institute . With Olabian 's funds I secured a suitable workroom with adjacent living quarters and purchased the components of a high-functioning integrator that would serve as an appropriate research assistant to a freelance discriminator . I hoped that this life would at least offer some interesting challenges , though I suspected that it would be a lonely affair . Friends would be few , most evenings would be spent with none but my integrator for company . As I dwelt poignantly on these prospects my other self gave the mental equivalent of an insouciant shrug . For a moment I wondered whose life I was living . Then I put aside the incertitude as the product of vain regret and began to assemble my research assistant .
