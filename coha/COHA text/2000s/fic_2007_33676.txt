The rain poured down as it could only in March . Steadily , persistently , undeviatingly , straight down as if it would never cease , taking all of the warmth , liveliness and hope out of the air . Gabriel Bell sat glumly , his right hand barely touching the steering wheel of his Lexus , wasting the phenomenally over-priced gas with which he 'd filled the tank this morning . The car inched forward , one vehicle in the endless line stretching in front of him heading south on the New Jersey Turnpike . " Some beginning to what 's supposed to be our big adventure , " his fifteen-year-old brother , Drew , complained , moving restlessly in the passenger seat . " Yesterday at breakfast we talked about leaving today , " Gabe said . " Remember that ? , He slid a glance at the man-child next to him . " Yeah . So ? " " You had nothing to do after school but finish packing your things so we could get an early start this morning . Early . No later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't help it if the guys came over to say goodbye , and I did some stuff while they were there . " Drew was defensive . " Right . Then you fell into bed and did n't get up until seven and spent the rest of the morning running around the apartment finding your CDs and video games . " Gabe kept his tone mild . No point in getting himself upset over this skirmish . What he intended to dowas win the war . " How 'd I know it was gon na take so long to find things ? , Drew said indignantly . " There was no rain this morning when we were supposed to leave . So deal with it , Drew . Complaining wo n't make the rain stop or the traffic go any faster . " Maybe he should 've taken the Garden State Parkway . It was definitely more scenic but I-95 would take them the straightest way from New York City to South Carolina . To a place he 'd never seen and , as Drew had said , to their big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it energized the atmosphere , there was a sudden acceleration in the line of cars and they resumed their usual highway speed . " Yes ! " Drew said and sat up straight . " It 's still raining , so there must have been an accident holding everyone up . Watch for it on your side . " Anticipating Drew 's reaction if he did see signs of an accident , Gabe moved into the far right lane . A few miles down the road , Drew exclaimed , " Man ! Look at that . Someone must have been hurt really bad ! " The whole passenger side of a small blue car was smashed against a guardrail , apparently pushed there by a large SUV that skidded on the wet pavement . The ground was littered with broken glass around which flares were set . A highway patrolman was sitting in his car out of the rain and writing in his notebook . " How 'd they get mangled together like that ? , Drew asked , turning back to get one more look . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to pass but he skidded on the wet road and hydroplaned into the blue car . " " They probTly had to get more than one ambulance , " Drew said thoughtfully . Although Drew said nothing more , Gabe noticed that he kept glancing over toward the speedometer . " What ? , Gabe asked . " It 's still raining hard and I was wondering how fast you 're going , " Drew replied . " You 've got a right to ask . It 's your life as well as mine . I 'm staying at fifty until we get past this rain . " The rain began to lighten a little at the same time that Gabe saw a restaurant exit coming up . " Let 's get off here for lunch and maybe by the time we 're through , the rain will have gone . " " Sounds good to me . " Drew was always ready to eat . A busload of people began entering the restaurant , cutting between Drew and Gabe . They milled around chattering and looking at a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see Drew for a few minutes . A group of men moved and there he was , looking anxious . " What happened to you ? I thought maybe you went back to the car , " he said . Gabe slung an arm around his shoulder for a second . " I got caught in the middle of this crowd . Let 's try to beat them or we 'll be here all afternoon . " Drew was the prime responsibility in Gabe 's life now , and every facet of his young brother 's existence had become magnified for Gabe since the death of their parents two years earlier . Pop had caught the flu , which had turned into pneumonia , and in a few short weeks it had taken him away . While the family was still dazed by the suddenness of his death , Ma had gone the same way before the winter was out , after being caught in the freezing rain while waiting for the bus . When Gabe had come out of the cloud of grief that had overwhelmed him , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't married Olivia Eagles after all . It had been a close call but he knew she was n't the kind of woman who would have welcomed a teenage boy into their home . Single and unencumbered , Gabe had vowed to make Drew the center of his care . Although he was twice Drew 's age , Gabe had loved his little brother from the moment his mother had laid him in Gabe 's arms at the hospital . " You 've always wanted a brother . " She was smiling and teary-eyed at the same time . " I expect you to take care of him . " Gabe thought of their mother as he and Drew were ushered to a table in the restaurant and served the soup of the day that their waitress had recommended . " I like soup when the weather 's like this , but this sure is n't like the chicken-noodle soup Ma used to make . " " That 's why I never get soup in a restaurant , " Drew said . " This chili is n't so bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always wanted to go places , " Gabe said . " Yeah , you 're right . It 's funny that Pop never did , but it 's because of him that we 're going to South Carolina . " It had been on another afternoon three weeks ago that Gabe had received a call while he was deciding between using the ground round steak for hamburgers or for meatballs to go with spaghetti . Drew was supposed to check in any moment ; Gabe would let him call it . The phone rang . " You want hamburgers or spaghetti and meatballs for dinner ? , Gabe asked . " I prefer spaghetti and meatballs as long as there 's herbs and garlic in the sauce , " a man said . " Is this Mr. Gabriel Bell ? " " Sorry . I was expecting my brother to call . I 'm Gabe Bell . What can I do for you ? " " My name is Jasper Moultrie , Mr. Bell . I 'm an attorney and I have information to give you regarding your great-grandfather 's will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? " " Whose will ? , Was this a new kind of scam ? Gabe wondered . At work , in the papers and on television , there were always warnings about the ingenious ways con artists were thinking up to get your money . He did n't know anything about a great-grandfather . " Ezekiel Bell was his name . He had a son named Edward who had a son named Booker . Your father , Mr. Bell . " Moultrie 's voice , quiet yet authoritative , made Gabe sit down at the table with the phone , prepared to give serious attention to what the attorney was saying . " How do you know all this ? , he demanded . " That 's what I 'd like to explain to you , Mr. Bell . I could come to your office on Chambers but I think you 'd prefer hearing the details and asking questions in the privacy of your home . When may I come over ? " He even knows where I work , Gabe thought . Maybe he 'd better see this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this will he should know about . " How about tonight ? Is that too soon ? , he asked . " That 's fine . Shall we say eight-thirty ? " " Fine . I live at- " " I know the address , Mr. Bell . See you soon . " elders who talked about a place that was special to the Africans in that part of South Carolina who 'd come from the same area in West Africa . They called it " De Land . " It held a treasure that was linked to where they 'd come from . " He paused but there were no questions . Gabe and Drew made an attentive audience . " De Land , " they said , was watched over by " sperrits " and the men in the Bell family beginning with Elijah . " " Did they know exactly where that place was ? , Drew asked . " Yes , but it did n't belong to them . Getting hold of it and then keeping it was the responsibility of Elijah and his descendants . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford movie to Gabe for him to take it seriously . At least Drew was entertained . " The stories caught the imagination of your great-grandfather , Ezekiel Bell Jr. , and he asked questions about it . He was a smart boy and in his belief , he made " De Land " his life work . He learned to read and write , earned money any way he could and saved every cent . His intuition had led him to " De Land . " he 'd dreamed about it and recognized it when he saw the remnants of this old plantation in Orangeburg County . He married Sarah who was a hard worker like him and understood his dream . " Every few years they 'd purchase more of the land . As the years went by he found several ways to increase his income . He bought a few acres to raise cows , hogs and even chickens for the market . He learned all about building houses when he built his own , and hired himself out to build for others . " Meanwhile he and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd purchased fifteen acres , and the special woodland the Africans had spoken about belonged to him . " " I do n't get it , " Drew said . " What made it special ? Did it have oil or something ? , He sat forward , his hands on his knees . " What made it special for him , " Mr. Moultrie explained , " was how the older Africans had felt something mystical about it . They used words he did n't understand . His father said they meant sacred ground and they said it with reverence . " Sacred ground ? Superstition or a legendary folktale , Gabe had to admit the attorney was spinning an interesting story at this point . Mr. Moultrie continued . " There was another fact about this sacred ground that was unique . Ezekiel had felt a calling to purchase the property . He knew he could n't sell it but had to hold it in trust for a particular person . " He paused . Gabe felt the hair rise on his arms as Moultrie 's calm gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Gabe tried to speak but his mouth was dry . " Me ? , he croaked . Drew was looking at him with the same astonishment he was feeling . " How could it be me ? " " Because it had to be passed to the eldest grandson in the sixth generation who carried the Bell name . " " How am I the sixth ? , Gabe was trying to make sense of what he was hearing . " Elijah Bell began the saga . His son , Ezekiel Sr. , was the second generation and Ezekiel Jr . was third . Edward was fourth . Booker , your father , was fifth , and that makes you the sixth . " " What happened to all the other children who must have been born in six generations ? " " Some died single , some had only daughters , not sons . Do you know of any relatives you have on your father 's side ? , Moultrie asked . Gabe shook his head . " Ma had four sisters and five brothers and most of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for anyone . When I asked Pop about his family he said there was only his brother , Jacob , but I did n't even meet him until after Drew was born . He was single and teased Pop about having two sons , one for Pop and one for him , " Gabe reminisced affectionately . Uncle Jake had been a favorite in the family . He could n't sit still any longer . " Excuse me , Mr. Moultrie . Would you care for something to drink ? Coffee , tea , juice , water ? " " Water 's fine . " Gabe took bottled water from the refrigerator , poured some over a glass of ice for Moultrie and grabbed two bottles for him and Drew . He felt like he was in Oz and had to anchor himself with something familiar before he heard the rest of this bizarre story .
