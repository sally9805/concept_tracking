Chances are , the answer is yes . Here , 18 fix-it solutions . Answer honestly : Do you have a bowl of candy sitting out on your coffee table ? Is your blender tucked away in a hard-to-reach kitchen cabinet ? Are there tray tables in every room that has a television ? If you answered yes to any of these questions , your house may be sabotaging your healthy-eating intentions . REDBOOK 'S yearlong Real-Life , Healthy Life Makeover is all about pinpointing those little decisions and lifestyle choices we make every day that get in the way of eating right , staying fit , and maintaining a healthy weight . So when our three participants-Adrienne , Jennifer , and Julie-told us about the bad-health traps in their homes , we knew it was time for some health-smart spring cleaning . by Nancy Rones 40% of U.S. households have the TV on during dinner , a habit linked to weight gain . Here , we search Adrienne 's house for hidden fat traps . Read on to see what she was doing wrong-and right ! - to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against them . 1 Keep these three appliances on your kitchen counter : blender , slow-cooker , and steamer . They make cooking healthy a cinch , says RLHL nutrition expert Lisa R. Young , Ph.D. , author of The Portion Teller . And if they 're always visible , you 'll use them more often . We had Adrienne clear some of her kids ' crafts supplies off the counter to make room for her blender ( great for soups and smoothies ) and slow-cooker ( for low-fat , one-pot meals ) . And hide these three : deep fryer , bread machine , and icecrear I 'm them way in the back of your cabinets and pull them out for special occasions only . 2 Banish clutter . A disorganized kitchen makes dialing for take-out that much more enticing than cooking , says Young . To pull it all together , organize one cabinet or drawer each weekend and find a proper home for those rarely used gadgets or pans . ( The key word is " used " - so if you never reach for a certain gizmo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a kitchen that 's actually easy and fun to cook in-and making fresh meals wo n't seem like such a burden . 3 Make your fridge a shrine . Adrienne 's refrigerator was loaded down with about 15 Disney magnets . The result : There was no room to hang a photo that reminds her of why she 's doing the program-a visual prompt that will keep her committed , says RLHL expert Dan Baker , Ph.D. , founding director of the Life Enhancement Program at Canyon Ranch spa in Tucson , AZ . So she stashed the magnets and hung a photo of herself from a 1994 vacation when she was a size 8 ( above ) . " Now , the picture of where I want to be weight-wise catches my eye and keeps me motivated , " says Adrienne . 4 Use fruit as a centerpiece . A bowl of fruit will decorate your table and encourage healthy snacking . Adrienne had a few pieces of fruit hidden in a dim corner ; we upped the selection , placed it in a pretty bowl , and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it 's within easy reach , Adrienne says she 's snacking more on these sweet , healthy treats . 5 Keep a cutting board at the ready . When you have a small one out on the counter , it 'll feel like less effort to slice veggies to munch on . 6 Create your own cookbook . Whenever Adrienne found a healthy recipe she liked , she 'd copy it down on an index card . The problem : The process was a waste of valuable time ! Instead , buy a basic three-ring binder and clear sleeves from an office-supply store . When you see a recipe you like , photocopy it or tear it out , then slip it into a clear sleeve . 7 Put your feel-good mantra in clear view . On a dryerase board in the kitchen , Adrienne wrote the phrase " Just keep swimming , " from the movie Finding Nemo . " When I hit a plateau and see the same number on the scale day after day , I think of Dory singing this phrase and that helps me push @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever quote or phrase keeps you motivated , plaster it all over-on your computer , bathroom mirror , or bulletin board . 8 Throw away holiday sweets . We reached up and grabbed a big basket of Christmas and Halloween candy from the top of Adrienne 's refrigerator . Whoa ! Those treats should be enjoyed on those holidays-with only a few days ' grace period afterward , says Young . Likewise , the bowl of candy Adrienne keeps out for her son as " potty rewards " serves as temptation for her . Young suggests keeping a small stash of candy for the kids out of sight . ( Like in a high cabinet that requires a stool to reach. ) 9 Keep your workout gadgets together . Kudos to Adrienne-on her dresser we spotted a basket containing her gym necessities , a heart-rate monitor , and an iPod . " The less time I have to hunt around for my gym stuff , the less time I have to talk myself out of going , " says Adrienne . 10 Make your living room less TV-centric . Studies show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are to be overweight . Unfortunately , most Americans , including Adrienne , arrange furniture around the television , says Young . We repositioned Adrienne 's furniture around her fireplace instead to inspire more conversation . Adrienne should also keep the TV behind the armoire 's closed doors when no one is watching it . ( Out of sight , out of mind. ) 11 Hang a full-length mirror . There was n't a single head-to-toe mirror to be found in Adrienne 's house-and it 's the best reality check to keep you honest . We hung one from her closet door , so she can better gauge her progress by seeing how her clothes fit . 12 Take water with you . Adrienne keeps a stash of bottled water near the door for easy grabbing-a great strategy , says Young . Guzzling water while running errands will keep you hydrated and thus ward off false hunger pains , says Young . 13 Donate your " fat " clothes . When you keep too-big clothes , you 're giving yourself permission to regain weight , says RLHL fitness expert Julian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto clothes that were too big , " says Adrienne . " It 's liberating to get rid of them . " For inspiration , hang a goal outfit in a can't-miss spot in vour closet . For Adrienne , it 's a much-loved size 12 blue suit that she wore before having kids . 14 Keep your treadmill or stationary bike in a favorite Spot . If yours is in a dark basement , you 'll never feel like using it . Adrienne keeps hers in front of a TV , which is a great idea , says Michaels . She can watch the news or a favorite show while working up a sweat . If you can , move your equipment to your family room or near a window for an inspiring view . get your table set for portion control * Make your table inviting . It 's as easy as lighting a few candles . The result : You 'll make your meal feel special , not something to rush through . And slowing down will help keep you from overeating , since it takes about 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's full . * Use tail , skinny glasses for juice . They visually make it seem like you 're drinking more than you are , says Young . And make a norefills rule ! Once you 've drained your glass , switch to water . * Dish up your main course on salad plates instead of dinner plates . You can fill your plate and still not overeat . * Serve your food on plates in the kitchen , not at the table . This makes it impossible to just mindlessly nab seconds . * But do keep the salad bowl at the table . So if you decide to have seconds , you 're eating light but filling veggies , not calorie-dense meats or bread .

" HOW TO JUMP OVER IT : Adrienne needs to remind hersetF that she 's not on a typical quick-fix diet , but a lifelong journey for good health , says RLHL fitness expert Julian Michaels , author of Winning by Losing . Whenever Adrienne 's feeling down or discouraged by the slow rate of results , she should imagine herself at her goal weight , either playing with her little ones , receiving a compliment on a new figure-flattering outfit , or having a Rocky moment at the gym .

Sometimes I stay up until 2 a.m. to get it all done . Which means I hardly have the energy to exercise the next day . " HOW TO JUMP OVER IT : Jennifer may be wasting valuable time by surfing the Web or watching TV , says RLHL organization expert Ronni Eisenberg , coauthor of Organize YourseH ! Jennifer should keep an activity log to see where her time is going . And she should cut herself some slack .

Instead of taking a lot of taxis like we normally would , we walked everywhere . I wore a pedometer and exceeded my goal of walking 10,000 steps a day . " THE HURDLE SHE STILL FACES : Finding her passion for being healthy . Although she did walk all over Paris , Julie confesses she also ate baguettes and chocolate with abandon . In fact , she 's had a hard time committing to the everyday ideas behind the RealLife , Healthy Life Makeover-and , unfortunately , her progress reflects that . " At the outset of this plan , my desire was to be fit and healthy in time for my 40th birthday , which just passed , " says Julie . " While I 've made some great lifestyle changes , such as drinking a lot of water and cutting trans fats out of my diet , I am back to the same weight I started with . I really need to refocus . " LOOKING FORWARD : Next month , our RLHL experts will give Julie the information @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a healthy lifestyle . GETTING BACK ON TRACK TODAY : Above all , Julie needs to cut through her negative self-talk ( Why is it so hard for me to stay on track ? Why is healthy eating so easy for other people ? ) , and then ask herself again , " What could drive me to succeed ? " says Baker . One big motivator for Julie seems to be the satisfaction she gets from a good workout . Thinking about that " high " during weak moments is one way to stay emotionally invested in getting fit . Julie may not have reached her immediate goal for her 40th birthday , but she can think long-term and switch her motivation to living with great health for another 40 years .

HERE , WHAT WE FOUND AND OUR EXPERTS ' SIMPLE SLIMMING SOLUTIONS . THE HABIT : Jennifer and her son typically eat meals in front of the TV . THE FIX : Jennifer should turn off the TV during meals and take advantage of her beautiful dining room table . Not only does watching the tube promote mindless eating , but using a space dedicated to dining will help Jennifer focus on every bite , says Young . She 'll also instill in her son the importance of taking time to savor meals-a wonderful lifelong health lesson that trains the body to tune into satiation signals-and they 'll both enjoy the benefits of truly focused family time !

" It 's risky hanging out in the kitchen more than you have to . " says Young . " Julie 's mind is likely to wander to the food surrounding her , making her more apt to eat when she 's not hungry-and less likely to accomplish her tasks . " THE HABIT : After the kids are in bed , Julie and her husband often veg out in the family room , eating snacks that they put on the coffee table . THE FIX : Position a large flower arrangement , oversize coffee table books , or even healthy cookbooks on your table so there 's no room for chips and cookies . " Coffee tables may seem like innocent decoration , but they make snacking way too easy , " says Young . " I tell clients to eat only at the dinner table .
