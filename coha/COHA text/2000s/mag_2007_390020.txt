Headnote At home in the Hollywood Hills , a food stylist creates a summer menu that 's as easy as it is beautiful " PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE FUN With food . They should n't be controlled in their cooking . " Not exactly the words you might expect to hear from a food stylist , someone who spends her working hours making sure every morsel on a plate looks absolutely perfect for the camera . But Valerie Aikman-Smith-who 's done everything from creating the elaborate historical banquets in Titanic to baHng flawless pizzas lor California Pizza Kitchen ads ( and who styles forSuruet too ) - has a laid-back approach to preparing her own food at home . Arugula for salad gets measured in loose handfuls , not cups ; reupes change as she makes them . " I just do everything to taste , " she says . On a recent hot summer day at her house , high up in the Hollywood Hills , Valerie put together an easy menu of peach salad , fish fillets on garlic toast , and ice cream doused in espresso . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has truly cinematic views that sweep from the chunky white HOLLYWOOD sign to the Griffith Observatory and , far away below , the tiny skyscrapers of downtown Los Angeles . Floor-to-ceiling windows around the dining room fold back , turning the space into a sort of enclosed patio-with the pool sparkling just a few feet from the table . Maybe the view is partly responsible for Valerie 's relaxed attitude as she cooks . If you ca n't find a certain ingredient , " use what 's available , " she says in her soft Scottish accent ( she grew upon the coast west of Glasgow ) . " Do n't get upset . Just substitute and enjoy . " She 's using peaches for her salads today , but any plump , juicy stone fruit would be fine . Now she 's building loose , tilting , free-form towers with the fruit , some snowy mozzarella cheese , and herbs . " You 've got to think " breezy summer day , ' ' " she says . " Go with the instinct of it . " Being a food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ awareness of beauty as well as flavor . Her peach salads have shape and motion and color ; her fish on toast is no beige blob , but a crisply browned fillet on a thick slice of grill-striped baguette , set on deep green arugula salad with yellow and red cherry tomatoes . And there are little touches she applies especially for the camera : basil and mint leaves tucked into the peach salad at just the right angle ( normally she 'd just layer them in ) ; a tiny blowtorch to crisp the fish 's skin an even golden brown , and no pan juices to mar its burnish ( she typically drizzles them on before serving ) ; cooled espresso to pour over the ice cream , so it wo n't melt into unattractive froth . But that 's just primping for showtime , to smooth out the rough edges that a camera would spotlight . In the kitchen and around the table , the spirit of Valerie 's cooking is carefree .

Often ginger ale is used along with or instead of the lemony soda , and sometimes a fortifying shot of gin goes in . You can arrange the fruit , cucumber , and mint any way you like . PREP TIME 20 minutes MAKES 8 drinks NOTES Persian cucumbers are small , thinskinned , virtually seedless , and very tasty . They 're sold at well-stocked grocery stores and often at farmers ' markets . Pimm 's No. 1 , a gin-based drink , was invented in 1823 by James Pimm , who served it at his oyster bar in London . It is widely available at liquor stores . 2 oranges , cut into half-moons 2 lemons , cut into half-moons 1 Persian cucumber ( see Notes ) or one 3-in. - long piece English cucumber , washed and sliced 2 cups Pimm 's No. 1 ( see Notes ) 4 cups Sprite or other lemon-lime soda 6 to 8 large sprigs mint , crushed gently , plus a few loose leaves Fill 2 pitchers 1M full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orange slices , a few lemon slices , and a layer of cucumber slices .

Peach and mint Caprese salad with curry vinaigrette Valerie likes to make this refreshing version of the classic Italian salad at the height of summer , " when everyone is sick of tomatoes .
