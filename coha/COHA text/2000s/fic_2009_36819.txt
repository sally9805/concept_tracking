I. <br> <p> 1 The Smiths , " Unlovable " <br> <p> I do n't believe in the devil anymore . But if I did , he would look a lot like Ari Malcolm Klein . My ex has eyes the same amber color as his skin , with flecks of red-gold in the iris , as if you could see the flames licking behind them . <p> Ari walked into our dressing room with just minutes to spare . This was our first gig in three years , for God 's sake . Seventies punk rock , CBGB style , flowed into the dressing room from the club outside . He flicked on a red-fringed lamp and leaned against a battered gunmetal school desk serving as the makeup table . I 'd been worried about him , but he looked fine ... not just as in " Everything 's fine , " but " Damn , ai n't he fine . " Still had his near-feminine leonine grace , an economy of movement , and a way of looking you in the eyes until you dropped your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when I lowered my eyes , I saw he was holding a small glassine Baggie casually between his index and middle fingers . He lifted it a bit , winked at me . " You want some ? " he said . He was naked to the waist , a slight discoloration on his arm where a tattoo of my name had once been , with the suspenders of his pants hanging down his legs . <p> I felt like cussing him out . He could n't be bothered to say hi or hello or we 're gon na tear this muthafucka up . Just , You want some ? I took a deep breath and played it icy . " No , " I said , perching on the edge of a couch that looked like it had been slept on . " The only thing I 'm on is Effexor . " A little depressive 's humor . " I do n't get high anymore . " <p> " Oh , you do n't , " he said , tapping a neat free-form line on the back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  quickquick  --  it was gone . " Well , it 's here , " he said , rubbing his sinuses . " If you want it . " <p> " I do n't , " I said . For one , I did n't even know what it was , not that that used to stop me . But whatever Ari was taking was always trouble , for him and for me . And I did n't need trouble right now . All I needed was to get this shit right . Just have one killer show , help our friend out , and see what manifested from there . <p> The last time I was onstage was more than a year ago , just a threesong-solo set at a showcase in Crown Heights . Red , my best girl from college , had put me up to it . Tonight was different , though . Davide , who 'd become our drummer after Red left the band , was riddled with cancer . And had no health insurance . And had a girlfriend and two kids . So a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money to pay his bills , and maybe even save a bit for his little girls , if we raised enough . <p> A month ago , I would have said that the chance of me and Ari playing together was about as remote as the pope announcing he 'd gotten married . But Red , who was here now fussing with my wardrobe , guilted us until we agreed to join the three-band bill . Red and the other organizers had wangled a deal where they took both the door and the drink profits from the Orchid  --  a very good deal . <p> The Orchid was where the music critics went when they wanted to see what was next . And after college , when I was doing real music criticism , not just being the face for some two-bit video show , this used to be my spot . I was one of the loud ones , you know , who would start talking shit about a weak band while they were still onstage , just to see if they could take the heat . Sometimes they crumbled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I had earned that power , the right to make or break a band before their album had even hit the streets . <p> Now , it was my turn to take the heat . And the decision to cross those few feet from the rows of couches and tables , from the safety of the darkness to the glare of the spotlight , seemed more foolish by the second . <p> We got the five-minute shout from the sound guy , a man with a long white ZZ Top beard . Ari bit his hangnails and I wanted to take his calloused fingertips into my mouth and smooth his eyebrows , just the way I used to . <p> Red had always been as petite as a pixie , with nappy apricot-colored hair and a delicate face . She tucked my hair into a chignon and asked me if my shirt was too tight . She 'd made the shirt herself , in the back of the little boutique she owned on Nostrand Avenue . And somehow in the week between the fitting and the show I 'd gained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corset than a blouse . <p> " Baby , I asked if the shirt was too tight . " <p> " No , Red . It 's great . " I had to breathe shallowly to keep the seams from ripping , but man , did it look good on me , bloodred raw silk that hugged my rib cage and blossomed like an overripe rose around the cleavage . <p> Someone came behind me and kissed me on the cheek , his chest brushing my back . I turned around and tilted my head up so I could properly see his face . He had flawless rich brown skin and his eyes were tight , almond-shaped , like a Benin mask . He tipped his head to me and then bent to give Red a hug . " You remember Leo , " she said . <p> Did I ever . After Red had introduced us at a record release party I had spent two days wrapped in schoolgirl fantasies : me in his arms , his arms around me , some heavy imaginary petting . No dream sex ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then . Leo told me all about his management company , his hip-hop clients , how he was trying to bring some integrity back to the rap game . And he 'd told me I should jump back in the flow , albeit as a solo act . <p> " You look good , baby , " Leo said . He kissed me on both cheeks and turned toward Ari . I suspected the two of them were too similar under the skin to like each other . Leo was dark ; Ari light . Leo had his hair in minitwists ; Ari 's was cropped . Leo was dressed in a crisp black suit . Ari , as usual , was punk-rocking it out . But underneath the skin , both Leo and Ari believed they were crusaders in a world of hypocrisy , and that no one could tell them how to live . That was what attracted me to each of them , and what made them insufferable solo and just plain dangerous together . <p> I tried some fast talking about the wardrobe to distract Leo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and mine so we faced Ari as a unit . <p> " You might want to get dressed , " Leo said softly . <p> " I 'm dressed , " Ari said . <p> " Like that ? " Leo said . <p> " Like this . " Ari sported shiny black shoes , tuxedo pants , suspenders , and , of course , the bare chest . <p> " This is n't some high school talent show . " Then Leo focused his eyes on the Baggie , lying on the old desk . He picked it up , drew it close . I 'd always had eagle eyes . Even from a couple feet away , I could see the powder 's yellowish tinge and the fine grain . <p> " Do the world a favor , " Leo said , tossing the bag back on a table . " Keep this shit out of my girl 's life . " <p> I 'd been focused on avoiding a fight , but I got distracted by the words ... my girl . I liked his possessiveness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had n't even gone on a date and he was claiming me . No one had in a very long time . <p> " It 's okay , " I said to Leo . " Ari 's just ... Ari . " <p> " And you are a queen , " he said . <p> The sound guy shouted , " Get the fuck onstage . " He was never one for niceties . <p> Ari picked up his guitar . Slowly . <p> I turned to Leo . " It really means a lot to me that you came out . And , as far as Ari 's ... stuff ... is concerned , I 'm not tempted . " <p> " You should n't be worried about being tempted , " Leo said . " You should get serious about making music your career again . That 's the reason I 'm here , baby , to see what you got . And you , " Leo said , turning to Ari , " should really get the fuck dressed . " <p> " Last time I checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . His words slurred slightly , so slightly that no one besides me would probably notice . Ari was looking me in the eyes as he said it . And then he turned , parted the velvet curtains , and walked out on the stage . <p> " Thank fucking God , " the sound guy said . " About ... fucking ... time . " <p> Red fiddled with my shirt again . " Honey , if it 's too tight , you ca n't breathe . You ca n't breathe , you ca n't sing . Quick , let 's get you out of this . " <p> " Just let it go . I 've got ta go , " I said , pushing her hands away . <p> " That 's right , " Leo said . " She better get onstage . " <p> " Leo , I know you mean well , but you better get out of my kitchen , " <p> Red said . And he did , if reluctantly . That was Red , a no-shit-taking Creole girl who could make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not trying to stress you out , baby girl , " Red said . " But we should probably get you out of this . I 've got a couple more things in my bag that will make you look out of sight . " <p> " It 's all good , " I told Red . It was n't , actually . I was short of breath , and my palms were sweating . Part wardrobe malfunction , part panic attack . Damn . If I could have given this all up , I would have , a long time ago . But music was my heartbeat , my oxygen , my bridge to the world . My demon , too . Oh , Jesus . Showtime . <p> Copyright 2009 Farai Chideya <br> Continues ...
