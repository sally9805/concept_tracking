Loreen Murphy had n't meant to hire a male prostitute in Las Vegas . It was all just a big , stupid , expensive misunderstanding . The night had started out pretty normal . There was no visibly strange alignment of stars , no static electricity in the air , nothing to warn anyone that things were about to turn so weird . <p> <p> She , along with other parents  --  mostly mothers  --  of the Tuckerman Elementary School band members from Travilah , Maryland , was in Las Vegas , where the kids were competing in a National Battle of the School Bands . Loreen , as the PTA treasurer , had been instrumental in working out a deal with the airline and several Las Vegas hotels so that parents and siblings could attend the contest . <p> <p> And everything had gone fine , right up until they tucked in the little third place-winning musicians and handed their trust over to a hotel babysitter who looked a little like Joan Crawford but was able to produce identification to prove she was employed by the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be fine , Loreen and her fellow PTA officers  --  Abbey Walsh ( vice president of the PTA and wife of the local Methodist minister ) and Tiffany Dreyer ( president of the PTA )  --  went down to the casino and spent a little time playing the nickel slots and sipping free margaritas from the hotel bar . <p> <p> For Loreen , life began to veer off course with the idea of taking a break after an hour of slot machines and free drinks to get up and move around so she did n't get slot machine elbow or whatever you 'd call a repetitive-motion injury from playing the one-armed bandit for too long . <p> <p> Besides , she 'd allocated twenty-five dollars to gambling , and according to the slip the high-tech machine had just spit out at her , she had only ten dollars left . When that money was gone , she 'd decided , the evening was over for her . <p> <p> " Are you sure you do n't want to come look around with me ? " she asked Tiffany , Loreen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paste in Mrs. Kelpy 's first-grade classroom and thrown it up in the cafeteria line half an hour later . <p> <p> " No way . " Tiffany kept her baby blues fastened on the machine in front of her . " I 've invested almost two hours in this machine . It 's going to hit the jackpot . I can just feel it . " <p> <p> " This is how gambling addiction starts , you know . " <p> <p> Tiffany nodded and lifted her drink to the one Loreen was taking with her to the bar . " I think alcoholism starts this way , too . " <p> <p> " TouchT . " <p> <p> Loreen made her way through the crowd  --  hundreds of people she 'd never know . The feeling of freedom was exhilarating . Jacob was safely with the sitter upstairs , and Loreen , who was a month away from her final divorce decree , was a " bachelorette on the loose " for the first time in eleven years . <p> <p> Robert , her soon-to-be ex , thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child and not enough on her life . Well , she was going to change that tonight . <p> <p> The lobby of the Gilded Palace was crowded with people , marble columns , and large potted palm trees . There was Muzak playing through some distant speakers , adding just enough vague ambience to make it feel like this was someone else 's life and she was free to do whatever she pleased with it . <p> <p> That 's when the trouble started . <p> <p> When Rod  --  that turned out to be his name , or at least the name he gave  --  first sat down and started talking to her , her first thought was that it must be on a dare from one of his drunk friends , who were undoubtedly hiding behind one of the gold Corinthian columns or enormous potted palms somewhere . <p> <p> But if he had drunk friends with him , they were hiding for a really long time . And besides , Loreen was n't unattractive enough to make a dare like that funny to a bunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a mom . <p> <p> Not a MILF , just a mom . <p> <p> Her dark hair had lost some of the luster of youth and was cut in a sort of hopelessly plain brown variation of Prince Valiant.No matter where she went to get it styled , and no matter what pictures she took with her , she always seemed to leave with the same schlumpy mom look . <p> <p> And the stylists ' advice that " You have a different face . I ca n't make you look like TV actress X , movie star Y , fill-in-the-blank , but this is the same basic haircut . . . . " <p> <p> In other words , You 're never gon na be that hot , honey . Give it up . <p> <p> It was true , too . Loreen was also suffering a little from postchildbirth spread.Nine years post-childbirth . Her butt was considerably wider than it had been the last time she 'd been single . Her high-waisted jeans kept everything sucked in pretty well  --  someone trying to identify her across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there "  --  but she was n't exactly what you 'd call buff either . And there was a telltale balloon of flesh below the waistband that she just could n't seem to get rid of . At least not without a steady diet of carrots , celery , and Pilates . <p> <p> But Rod looked at her as if she had just stepped off the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition . <p> <p> Upon reflection , that in itself probably should have made her more suspicious . <p> <p> " Margarita , huh ? " He nodded at her glass and smiled . The way his mouth curved , showing white-white teeth , made him look like a real-life movie star . " Pretty lady like you deserves something more special than that . " <p> <p> It was such a lame line and she knew it , but she got a kick out of it anyway . " Well  --  " She swallowed a burp and hoped he did n't notice . "  --  they put a Grand Marnier floater on top . " <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class , like you . " He smiled again . " I 'm Rod , by the way . " <p> <p> " Loreen Murphy . " Not only was it nuts to give her last name to a total stranger , but she held out her hand like a total dork . " Nice to meet you . " <p> <p> He lifted her hand to his lips and kissed the back of it , keeping eye contact all along , just like Leonardo DiCaprio did with Kate Winslet in Titanic . " Where are you from , Loreen ? " <p> <p> " Is it that obvious I 'm not from here ? " <p> <p> He laughed . " You look way too happy to be from here . " <p> <p> " I 'm from Maryland . " <p> <p> " And what do you do in Maryland ? " <p> <p> " I 'm a Realtor . " And a PTA treasurer , and a mom , and a soon-tobe ex-wife , and a whole lot of other easy-to-pigeonhole labels . <p> <p> He looked impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off every deal made . Good gig . " <p> <p> She shrugged . " It 's feast or famine . " <p> <p> " What about tonight ? Is it feast or famine tonight ? " <p> <p> " Feast . " She smiled . It really was . This letting-go stuff was pretty good . Maybe Robert had been right . A little bit , anyway . " Tonight , it 's all feast . " <p> <p> Rod chuckled charmingly and gave an approving nod . " Are you looking for company tonight , Loreen ? " <p> <p> For a crazy moment she was ten years younger , one impending divorce lighter , and free to be a flirt . It felt awesome . She took another sip of her drink . " Well , I do n't know . Are you offering ? " <p> <p> " As a matter of fact , Loreen , yes . I am . " <p> <p> She could not believe this gorgeous hunk of man was coming on to her ! This never happened at home ! <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacob had told Loreen that Robert had a girlfriend who came over for dinner . <p> <p> So , with that little piece of icky news in mind , what the hell ? Rod was a gift from God as far as she was concerned . As for why he would be interested in her  --  well , why not ? No , she was n't a supermodel , but she was n't a dog either . In her day , plenty of guys had come on to her . It had n't happened for a while now , but maybe this was the first time she 'd been relaxed enough  --  and anonymous enough  --  to put out an available vibe . <p> <p> " Sounds good to me , " she said with a laugh . Females all around them were looking on with clear envy , and Loreen liked it . " So you can tell all these other women you are taken . " <p> <p> A nod . " Consider it done . " <p> <p> She 'd worried he would n't get the joke and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was glad for his response . " Well , I 'm honored . " <p> <p> Robert had moved on . So would she . <p> <p> Even if it was for only a few minutes . <p> <p> " The honor is mine . " Rod lifted a perfect brow over one pale blue eye . Actually , his brows were so perfect that she concluded he had to wax them , which was a little troubling . But then again , one look at his whip of a smile and it did n't matter anymore . " Do you like champagne , Loreen ? " <p> <p> " Depends what you mean by champagne . I 've never had the good stuff . " It was true . Her experience was limited to the sort that tasted like melted Popsicles and could be used to sweeten coffee . But tonight she 'd had enough tequila to lubricate her confidence and fuel her awkward flirting . " Does it come with the deal , Mr. Rod ? " <p> <p> " Of course , if you like . The menu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bartender with one breezy motion and said to him , " Piper . " Then he turned back to Loreen . " So you 're a fine champagne virgin . And I get to break you in . " <p> <p> She smiled . In fact , she damn near trilled . " Be gentle with me . " <p> <p> " Whatever you like . " He smiled , and the bartender set two tall phallic flutes on the bar and poured bubbling gold liquid in . <p> <p> " Thank you , Piper , " Loreen said to him . <p> <p> Rod chuckled again . " You "  --  he clinked his glass to hers  --  " are adorable . " <p> <p> " So are you ! " she gushed , a little too enthusiastically . Then , in a misplaced effort to regain the cool dignity she was going for , she said , " For someone so young , I mean . " Oh , that was dumb . Really clumsy . And it did n't seem like she was going to be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway ? " <p> <p> He looked at her very seriously . " About the same age as you , I 'd guess . I 'm twenty-four . " <p> <p> " Smooth , Rod . That was really smooth . " <p> <p> He looked at her guilelessly . " What do you mean ? " <p> <p> " I 'm not twenty-four , " she said , downing the rest of her champagne . " And you know it . " <p> <p> " Twenty-three ? " he guessed , then furrowed his brow in mock consternation . " Younger ? Tell me I did n't just buy a drink for an underage Lolita . " <p> <p> " You 're good . You 're really good . " Loreen smiled and took a sip of the champagne . It was sort of blah as wine went . Like unsweetened ginger ale . But , hey , if this was the drink for celebrations , she 'd go for it , because this was a celebration . " This is great . " <p> <p> He gave a nod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are we going to do next ? Or should I ask when ? " <p> <p> It would have been the perfect opportunity to say something sophisticated and witty , but apparently Myrna Loy was n't available for channeling right then . " I  --  I 'm . . . not sure . " <p> <p> " Obviously we could use some privacy . " <p> <p> Mmmm . His voice could melt butter . <p> <p> As a matter of fact , his voice  --  or maybe his long-lashed baby blues or perhaps that shiny mop of dark hair that her fingers were just itching to run through  --  was melting something deep in Loreen 's long-chilly nether regions . <p> <p> And he wanted to be alone with her ! <p> <p> This was a night she 'd never forget . <p> <p> " Privacy would be nice , " she said , then giggled as the champagne bubbles actually tickled her nose , just like all the bimbos in old movies said it did . <p> <p> " I have a room upstairs unless . . . you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting the babysitter and all the kids at the door and laughed . " Let 's go to your room . " <p> <p> " Of course . " He held a hand out and helped her off her stool . " Send the bottle up , please , " he said to the bartender . <p> <p> " You and Piper seem to know each other . " <p> <p> He looked puzzled for a second , then smiled . " There you go again . Yeah , Roger and I have worked here for a long time . " <p> <p> " Ah . " She had n't realized Rod worked there , but she 'd already said so many dumb things that she did n't want to add to it by asking what he did , just in case it was somehow obvious . " How long have you worked here ? " <p> <p> " The hotel or the town ? " <p> <p> " Um . . . I . . . " She did n't really care either way . " The hotel . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half now . " <p> <p> Only a twenty-four-year-old could think that was a long time . " You like it ? " <p> <p> " It allows me to meet beautiful women like you . How could I not love it ? " <p> <p> She could have gotten stuck on that plural  --  beautiful women  --  but since this was n't a real relationship in any sense of the word , she let it slide and just took the compliment . " You 're quite the flatterer . " <p> <p> " No , I mean it . " He stopped her and looked her in the eye . " Sincerely . " <p> <p> She felt the heat climb into her cheeks . " Thanks . " <p> <p> He pushed the elevator button , and they glided upward to a suite on the top floor . One entire wall consisted of windows that overlooked the aurora borealis-like glow of the Las Vegas strip . It was enchanting . <p> <p> Loreen was standing in front of the window , looking for the big guitar they always showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put his arms around her . " Like it ? " <p> <p> " I love it . I could look at this view every night for the rest of my life . " As soon as she said the words , Loreen had the horrible feeling that maybe this handsome stranger was a serial killer who was about to murder her , and , though he would be the only one to know , her final words would echo ironically through time . <p> <p> There was a knock at the door , and Rod went to get it , murmured some things , and came back into the room with an ice bucket , a bottle , and two champagne flutes . <p> <p> As he poured the champagne , Loreen noticed the label : PIPERHEIDSIECK . Oh , shit . Rod had n't been calling the bartender Piper ; he 'd been asking for the champagne . <p> <p> But then , like an idiot , she 'd proceeded to call the guy " Piper " and , worse , feel really clever doing so . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and even said she was adorable . So . . . she 'd go with that . <p> <p> " That was nice of Piper to send up some more Piper , " she said , knowing it was pathetic , but at the same time at a complete loss about what else to say . <p> <p> Rod moved over to Loreen and smoothly took the glass from her hand and set it on the end table by the sofa . " I ca n't wait any longer to do this , " he said , then lowered his mouth down onto hers . <p> <p> He did n't give her time to work up some nervousness . He just went for it . <p> <p> Never  --  never  --  had she been kissed like this . Everything in her tingled , from her head right down her spine and into the center of her being . Rod undressed her slowly , so slowly that even the fabric running across her skin felt like a caress . <p> <p> He was an expert at touching a woman , pushing buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the crest of ecstasy over and over again , then backing away just long enough to make her nearly scream with need . <p> <p> By the time he finally got down to business , she wanted it more than she 'd ever wanted anything in her life . <p> <p> She could n't say how long it lasted . Maybe an hour , maybe five , but the time Loreen spent with Rod was so intense that his abrupt withdrawal at the end of it came as a shock . <p> <p> " Oh , shit . " <p> <p> It was n't exactly the romantic conclusion she was expecting . " What 's wrong ? " <p> <p> " The fucking rubber broke . " <p> <p> " What ? " <p> <p> " I said the fucking  --  rubber  --  broke . " Suddenly Rod sounded like a seven-year-old who 'd struck out at bat . <p> <p> So much for ol ' Rico Suave . <p> <p> But Loreen 's first reaction was one of relief . The " Oh , shit " was n't because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom , and regretted it . " The rubber broke ? " she echoed , trying to get a grasp on what he was actually saying . <p> <p> " Yeah . " He threw up his hands . " Fuck . " <p> <p> She swallowed the urge to say , I believe we just did , and instead asked , " Are you sure ? " <p> <p> He nodded . " I 've done this enough to know when there 's a problem , and this is a problem . " <p> <p> A moment of heavy silence dropped between them . <p> <p> " Have you been tested ? " Loreen asked , her former relief replaced rapidly by panic as she realized the implications . She 'd just had sex with a stranger and the condom had broken , spilling all kinds of potential diseases and bacteria right into her most vulnerable parts . Short of slashing open her wrist and rubbing it on a petri dish , she could n't do something more bacterially dangerous . <p> <p> " I 'm tested every month , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " I have n't had sex in about a year . " <p> <p> He nodded like that was unsurprising . " Yeah . But have you been tested ? " <p> <p> That yeah was insulting . " My doctor did that test , " she said , " along with every other medical test , last year when I could n't shake the flu . It was negative . " <p> <p> His shoulders lowered slightly with relief . <p> <p> She waited a moment , then , when he did n't volunteer the information , prompted him with " And your tests ? " <p> <p> He waved the question away like it was silly . " Negative on all counts . We have a really good doctor here who checks us out really thoroughly . " <p> <p> " Heck of a medical plan you have . " <p> <p> " It 's the law . " He shrugged . " What about pregnancy ? Are you on anything ? " <p> <p> For the past year ? On the remote chance that she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Not likely . Good thing she could n't have more kids . " After my son was born , I had my tubes tied , " she lied . It was easier than explaining that she just was n't able to get pregnant , that a couple of years of trying with Robert had proved that beyond a doubt , and that it made her hang on to her only son 's childhood like it was a life raft in the ocean . <p> <p> " Good thing . " Rod gave a dry laugh . " I 'm sure the last thing you need is a pregnancy . " <p> <p> " Right , " she agreed , because she was polite . But . . . what did he mean by that ? The last thing she needed ? Even though it was true , what was it about his words that sounded distinctly detached ? No , they did n't know each other , and no , she definitely was n't going to get pregnant from this , but still . . . . What a dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much into this . She 'd had a weird night  --  a one-night stand ! The first time in her life ! That was so unlike her . And she was still out even though it was  --  she looked for the green glow of the digital clock by the bedside  --  11:36 P.M. <p> <p> Good Lord , she had to leave . Everyone was probably wondering where she 'd disappeared to . <p> <p> " I 've got to run , " she said , meaning it literally . She threw back the sheets and started running around the darkened room , collecting her clothes . <p> <p> " Are you sure ? I 'm still available for a few hours . And I had a great time with you , " Rod said , and back was the mellow , sexy tone that had drawn her to him in the first place . Then he grabbed her wrist , pulled her to him , and kissed her deeply . If it were n't for the time , she would have fallen right back into bed with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , wishing she could come up with something more clever  --  more memorable  --  than mere agreement . <p> <p> " Maybe next time , then . " He ran his hands down her back , sending tingles along the trail of his touch . <p> <p> " I do n't come here often , " she said to him as she pulled back . She had to get dressed and leave , no matter how great his hands felt on her . <p> <p> " Well , if you do , " Rod said , pulling up his jeans and turning to her with the button tantalizingly undone , " you know where you can find me . " <p> <p> She nodded and gave a laugh . " At the bar downstairs ? " She was joking . <p> <p> He nodded . He was not joking . " Unless I 'm already working . " <p> <p> " Oh . " Okay , so he hung out at the bar all the time ? And he could say , absolutely , that he 'd be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something here was n't adding up . <p> <p> " You can just leave the money on the dresser , sweetheart . " He was buttoning his shirt , and did n't have so much as a hint of a smile when he said it . <p> <p> But Loreen laughed . Because . . . it had to be a joke . <p> <p> " Should n't that be my line ? " She was trying to keep the mood light , but still . . . ew . She did n't like this joke . It was n't really funny , no matter who said it . <p> <p> Rod looked at her , confused . " I 'm sorry ? " <p> <p> " Oh , nothing , I was just kidding . " Too . <p> <p> Right ? <p> <p> He gave a vague smile and gestured with a hand that suddenly seemed a little limp . Something less masculine than it had seemed just a couple of hours before . " Yeah . So , the dresser right over there . " He gestured and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred and forty for the champagne . " <p> <p> Oh , God . He was n't kidding . He was . . . She 'd just . . . Oh , God , she 'd just hired a male prostitute . How the hell had this happened ? She thought back over their conversation , trying to figure out just where the breakdown in communications had occurred . <p> <p> Are you looking for company tonight , Loreen ? <p> <p> What had she said ? Oh . Are you offering ? An innocent question . Flirty . Not really a proposition . <p> <p> Yes , as a matter of fact , I am . <p> <p> What an idiot ! How had she not seen this before ? <p> <p> " Loreen ? " <p> <p> She snapped back to attention . " Yes ? " <p> <p> " Is something wrong ? " <p> <p> " No ! " She said it too quick . " I was just . . . I just realized we did n't discuss . . . " <p> <p> He narrowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sexy . " We did n't discuss what , Loreen ? " <p> <p> " Price . " It sounded like a question . From a tiny little person . She could barely eke the word out . <p> <p> His brow relaxed fractionally . " Right . When you did n't ask , I thought you were a regular , and that for some reason I just did n't remember you . " <p> <p> Great . Not only had the whole flattery thing been a game , but he actually thought she seemed like someone who regularly paid for sex . <p> <p> From him . <p> <p> The guy actually thought he 'd fucked her before  --  perhaps more than once  --  and forgotten . And he thought that did n't really matter . Like . . . her feelings would n't be hurt ? <p> <p> She felt sick . " No , " she said coolly . So much for looking at her like she was a swimsuit model . But it was stupid to be upset with a prostitute for not telling little white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> <p> She had to get out of here . <p> <p> " It 's one g . " He put Rembrandt Extra Whitening on his toothbrush and started to brush vigorously , presumably to remove all DNA traces of Loreen so he 'd be fresh and clean for the next pathetic loser who came along . <p> <p> " I 'm sorry , I do n't . . . How much is that ? " <p> <p> He spit a foamy toothpaste mess into the sink , then swished water in his mouth and spit again . Less attractive by the second . " A thousand dollars , " he said , taking the hand towel from the chrome rack and blotting his face . " Plus the champagne , like I said . " <p> <p> Her heart leapt into her throat . A thousand dollars . <p> <p> These three hours were going to be $333 an hour . She had n't had a therapeutic massage since Mother 's Day six years ago because she could n't pay the sixty bucks an hour . There was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour , times three , for having sex with this guy . Good Lord , she 'd even gone down on him . <p> <p> He had to be kidding . <p> <p> But this was n't a guy who was into kidding around . <p> <p> He was a businessman . <p> <p> And somehow she had to come up with a thousand bucks quick . <p> <p> Excerpted from Secrets of a Shoe Addict by Beth Harbison Copyright 2008 by Beth Harbison Published in June 2009 by St. Martin 's
