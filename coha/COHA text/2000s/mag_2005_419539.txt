" We have the potential to become a world of trading partners who depend on each other for the well-being of our people . That certainly is a future less threatening than the one we know at present . " CENTURIES AGO , a group of Peruvian Indians were looking out from the ocean shoreline . Something appeared far away that they did not recognize . Seeing the sails of Spanish invaders on the horizon , they talked about it and , lacking a better answer , explained what they saw as a freak of nature and went on about their business . Their limited life experience did not include sailing ships . So , they screened out what they failed to understand-and let disaster in . As we see the sails of the global economy on the horizon , will we screen out what we do not understand ( or accept ) and just go about our business , or will we anticipate what is happening and adapt ourselves to a world that is changing right before our eyes ? The answer will make all the difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The issues arising out of the growing global economy are highly emotional . They are about jobs and livelihoods , as well as feeding our families and ensuring their safety and well-being in a world that presents threats , but also great opportunities . As a start , let us discuss what really is happening in outsourcing and why . Countries such as India and China have vast pools of skilled and well-educated workers available to the U.S. and other countries . The first trend is for U.S. firms to source jobs abroad rather than at home . The second trend is companies taking advantage of advanced computer technology to import services from other nations , like having radiologists in Bangalore read X-rays taken in Boston . Companies are outsourcing jobs and importing services to cut costs , increase productivity , and meet their customers ' demands for low-price , high-quality goods and services . In doing this , they are saving money and investing some of it in research and development to improve products and services as well as create better-paying jobs . All of this makes good sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we are able to shop around and select the best companies to provide what we want , when we want it . These enterprises produce high quality and low price . They attract more customers and top-notch employees-and they create jobs . Sometimes those jobs are created in the U.S.-and sometimes offshore . This gives me the chance to dispel one prevalent myth : that when a U.S.-based company creates jobs offshore , we are losing American jobs . The fact is , these jobs would not have been created domestically in the first place . These are jobs that are created in those markets , or not at all . If IBM is going to penetrate international markets , it can not do that unless it is part of those markets . They must be close to their customers if they are to be successful , and that means sourcing outside the U.S. and inside those markets . That does not mean , however , that IBM will not be creating jobs in the U.S. as well , which , in fact , it is doing . Fears of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ different forms . There was permanent job loss when we moved from an agrarian to an industrialized economy . In the 1980s , we saw manufacturing jobs lost and service jobs gained . In the 1990s , companies were going to de-layer middle management and bureaucracy forever . A few years later , we panicked about e-commerce and dot-corns annihilating oldeconomy jobs . At present , the monster in the closet is outsourcing . Fear is growing that there will be significant and permanent loss of highly-skilled jobs to the rest of the world . Outsourcing debate The emotional debate about outsourcing has obscured the fact that it is a natural and normal part of a free market system and a fundamental component of competing successfully in the global economy . Yet , when we lose our job or see a colleague lose his or hers , it is easy to feel overwhelmed and traumatized . The hard truth , however , is that permanent , lifetime jobs no longer exist . All positions , in some sense , are temporary . That means that all of us will face job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fact of life in a freemarket economy that constantly is innovating and advancing . We are continuing our shift from an industrialized to a services economy-and we not only are surviving this evolutionary step in the economic cycle , we are thriving . We saw almost 2,500,000 jobs created each year in the 1990s during the long boom . Since February , 2001 , though , the same number of positions have been lost . Every time the U.S. has experienced dramatic changes like these in the past , people have tried to stop them . This instance is no different , although , just as our predecessors have found , it is futile to try to stop the natural progression of the economy toward globalization . It is like standing in the middle of the freeway hoping to slow down traffic . You can not stop it . You may not like what you see on the horizon , but to move forward , you must , at some point , embrace the change . The movement toward a global economy and workforce will be filled with disruptions and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to minimize the pain and capitalize on the opportunities before us . In the U.S. , we have created mechanisms to help people move from jobs that are destroyed to jobs that are created . We certainly do not relish the disruptions that these shifts bring , but we have effective ways to deal with them . Jobs will be lost-but the former employees can and will be employed again and again and again . // A new aspect of this transition is that the changing jobs situation is affecting small as well as larger companies . Moreover , it is touching white-collar , knowledge workers-managers , executives , and information technology professionals , not just unskilled , less-educated labor . Yet , in another sense , some white collar employment always has been of a temporary nature . Think about the armies of consultants from Deloitte &; Touche , Accenture , and Hewitt and McKenzie . To get a sense of what is happening , a look at the small business sector is instructive . A start-up in Silicon Valley can go to India and hire highly skilled workers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could hire a team of five to six programmers in India for about the same cost as one or two in Silicon Valley . One firm calculated the cost of keeping one tech employee in Silicon Valley at $15,000 per month . In New Delhi , an individual with the same skills and responsibilities costs $2,500 . That is a savings of $150,000 a year . By sending 10 jobs to India , a start-up can slash $1,500,000 from its payroll . In addition , it will be able to expedite product development , having access to a 24/7 workforce . Companies using outsourcing will be more attractive to venture capital firms because these firms will see a faster return on their investment . If a company can bring its products to market faster and cheaper through outsourcing , it will increase its chances to win the competition for limited funding dollars . It only is going to get easier for companies of all sizes to send business operations and functions overseas . The cost structure of establishing and maintaining Internet connectivity between North America and Asia used to be very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last year alone . As prices drop , more companies will outsource . By 2015 , the number of jobs relocating offshore is expected to reach 3,400,000 . Yet , this only is a small percentage of the total number of jobs constantly being created and destroyed within the American economy . About 33,000,000 jobs are expected to be created in the U.S. in the next seven years . ( And we are worried about 3,400,000 jobs that others have gained and we have not . Does that sound callous ? ) In moving toward a global economy , we can not be the only ones to gain . Trading partners are exactly that-partners . Both sides get something of value . Unilateralism will not work . Our real challenge , then , as a nation and as business leaders , is making sure that current and future workers are able to move into areas in which their skills can be put to work . We must make lifetime learning a reality . We need to make continuing education more affordable and accessible . Education must not stop after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these levels is not possible because they lack time and money . Companies must be open to flexible work schedules so that individuals can take the time to invest in ongoing 3 education ; firms would be wise to reimburse employees who choose to update their skills while on the job . We need to support school-to-work programs , not only in number , but in scope . Government and businesses have to change the recent trend of cutting funds for these initiatives . Some of the most successful programs reach down to the elementary school level to plant seeds that one day may influence career choices . Most of the current focus is on skilled trades . Programs target kids who are at risk for not attending college . That is fine as far as it goes , but schools and employers should expand into areas such as computer science , math , and engineering , so that the kids who are most likely to go to college are directed into those areas in which worker shortages will be greatest . We should reconfigure unemployment insurance , earmarking a portion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a disincentive to reenter the workforce . Special funds for the purpose of retraining would help ease the cost burden of education and help move people toward the occupations that have to be filled . Workers at all levels have to keep current with the changing world around us , especially with technology . We need to encourage our employees to take advantage of every educational opportunity offered by companies , government , or grants . A company I know has 140,000 employees . It has measured the current skill level of each , and then developed a career plan that includes a long-term " skilling " path . Keeping employees " skills current allows the firm to be more flexible in a changing marketplace , and it enables employees to take advantage of new opportunities as they develop throughout their career . Entrepreneurism must be encouraged as well . Governments and universities should be working together to cultivate innovation and new businesses . For example , the state of New York has invested $620,000,000 of a planned $1,000,000,000 program to establish a network of research and development incubators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the state 's university system and private industry . The fact is that entrepreneurs and small businesses create most American jobs . While the big companies are searching for resources overseas , domestic entrepreneurs are producing resources at home . As the Wall Street Journal reports , " Self-employment and start-ups are driving the economic recovery as some 400,000 Americans went to work for themselves last year . " The success of these start-ups means even more jobs , as they become established businesses over time . Many of these entrepreneurs are immigrants , whose optimism , energy , and appetite for risk have fueled our economy for generations . They will continue to do so in the global economy . We must rally our companies , schools , and country to embrace diversity . We have to broaden and deepen our language skills , encourage international studies and travel , and reach out and engage other cultures . More of our students should study abroad . It is necessary to learn about other countries ' history and read their literature . Today , foreign students know much more about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is no room for " Ugly Americans " on the global stage . Our world ought not begin and end at the edges of our cities or the boundaries of our shores . We must expand our thinking as well as our travels . We must take off our parochial blinders and become students of the world . If we take a hard look at what is going on around us , there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic . Yet , there are some warning signs as well . The demand for skilled labor is up-and the supply is down . The number of U.S. graduates in math , science , and engineering is not growing fast enough to meet the expected need . In India , the number of college graduates with those degrees is five to 10 times greater than in the U.S. In 2002 , 60,000 engineers graduated from U.S. colleges . China and India graduated five times that many . Their Asian neighbors , South Korea , Japan , Taiwan , Hong Kong , and Singapore , share a zeal for education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a recent international assessment of eighth-graders , Singapore scored best in the world and joined five Asian neighbors in beating the U.S. American kids came in 19th . " We absolutely must strengthen our talent pool , " stresses Charlene Barshefsky , an Asian expert who served as U.S. Trade Representative under Pres. Bill Clinton . Otherwise , she warns , " We will lose our competitive edge within a generation . " She favors more emphasis on math and science starting in the third grade . In addition to strengthening our talent pool , we need to broaden it . Severe labor shortages are likely to return within 10 years , especially if our economy continues to get stronger . Certain industries , such as health care , construction , and defense/security , already are suffering . The retirement factor When the baby boomers start retiring , there will be 168,000,000 jobs in our economy , but only 158,000,000 people in the labor market to fill them . How will we close the shortfall ? Three things will help . First , there is the continuing flux of immigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essential engine of our economy . Immigrants serve as flexible , lowwage workers in industries undergoing transition . One myth states that immigrant and unskilled labor are one and the same . That is not true . There is a deep and wide pool of highlyeducated and - skilled people who have emigrated-or will-to the U.S. They want to put their creativity and capabilities to work in what they see as " the land of opportunity . " Rather than displacing native workers in any significant way , studies show that a steady flow of immigrant labor actually helps create jobs . For example , according to one study , if no Mexican immigration to Los Angeles County had occurred between 1970-80 , 53,000 production jobs , 12,000 high-paying nonproduction slots , and 25,000 positions in related industries would have been lost . In a service-based global economy , skilled labor becomes more and more important . Because of technology , this labor can be linked across the world into one global labor force . This capability makes possible a startling new phenomenon-immigrants who never leave home . These " stay-at-home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid decline in the cost of technology and telecommunication and rise in computing power mean that foreign nationals can work for Dell Computer from their homes in Delhi . A second source of help is the temporary jobs industry , which supports other companies as they adjust up and down in employment , assuring that there is ready access to workers with the right skills at the right time . They help business succeed in a fluctuating economy , responding to cyclical shifts in revenues by redeploying talent where it is most needed and productive . Contingent workers , or temporary employees , and other noncore employees represent 30% of the entire U.S. labor force , reports the Advisory Council of the Department of Labor-and that number is expected to increase dramatically in the next 10 years . Outplacement firms play a role as well . They teach people how to find and acquire a job , how to move beyond being stuck emotionally and functionally in being without employment . They take care of those caught in the middle of change . They provide the counseling , coaching , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to get them ready to capitalize on the changing opportunities the global economy presents . Companies that hire temporary employees enjoy the freedom and flexibility of using staff resources as needed versus investing in employees on a permanent , full-time basis . This helps improve productivity and profitability . Many employees today want the flexibility of temporary work as a bridge to full-time employment , a way to go back to school parttime to further their education , or to try a new career path without making a long-term commitment to an employer . A third thing that will help us fill the shortfall of labor is the strength of the U.S. itself . We are the envy of the world for our open borders , lack of structural barriers , and abundant diversity of our people . Our workforce reflects the faces of the people around the world . Firstand second-generation Americans have the language skills and the cultural understanding to be citizens of the world and participate fully in the global economy . We are a nation of immigrants . We came from afar seeking to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands who seek our shores today . The U.S. is a magnet for the best and the brightest . They will continue to come as long as opportunity abounds . They can and will start businesses of their own . That is good for them and us . I believe that the global economy represents the next Silicon Valley , the next big growth opportunity for our companies , workers , and nation . In the coming years , as the economies of China , India , Mexico , Russia , and the Philippines heat up from their growing interdependence with the U.S. , it is likely that they will become our biggest trading partners . The potential upside demand from these countries and from others in a major global expansion is enormous , bigger than the tech expansion of the 1980s and 1990s , enough to fuel the U.S. economy and create jobs for decades to come . We have the potential to become a world of trading partners who depend on each other for the well-being of our people . That certainly is a future less threatening than the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Challenger is CEO of the global outplacement firm Challenger , Gray &; Christmas , Inc. , Chicago . // <p>
