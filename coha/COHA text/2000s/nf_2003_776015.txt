JULIA 'S " TREASURE " // With a good education , you can always be free. - Julia Bickford Fisk Douglas // He arrived at Columbia Law School smelling of sheep , carrying nothing but a battered suitcase and the burden of his mother 's ambition that he should become president of the United States . With his unruly sandy-blond hair and dirty , rumpled clothes , Orville Douglas felt in mid-September 1922 a lot less like the valedictorian of North Yakima High School and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate from Whitman College and a lot more like one of the sheep he had tended on a train part of the way cross-country . // Now , outside of the Beta Theta Pi fraternity house , Douglas knew that he would have to change everything about himself-even his name-to put all of the ghosts of Yakima , Washington , behind him . But Julia Fisk Douglas had raised her eldest son to meet such challenges . // Julia had named her son William Orville to bring honor to the two men whom she most admired : Orville Fisk , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the husband she deified . Raised on his mother 's stories about these patriarchs , young Orville grew up believing that his very name destined him for greatness . His grandfather , he believed , had served with distinction as a member of the Union forces in the Civil War . He thought that his father had been a devoted family man . Only Julia knew that the truth was far different-and that Orville 's life thus far , filled with obstacles and disappointments , had closely mirrored the lives of the men whose names he bore . // A New England farmer , like his father before him , Orville Fisk had stood five feet nine inches tall , with an unruly tuft of light hair , a very pale complexion , and compellingly clear blue eyes . In 1861 , at the age of twenty-four , he married Salome Bickford Richardson , a widowed mother of two who was six years his senior , and fully expected that the rest of his days would be spent tilling the earth . Like so many of his peers , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellion in the South , Orville enlisted for three years . On Octo- ber 4 , 1861 , he became a private in Company D of the Sixth Regiment of the Vermont Volunteers and was mustered into the army in Montpelier eleven days later . // But while his regiment trained , Orville quickly discovered that military life did not suit him . By February of the following year he chose to follow his own path , checking himself in and out of a series of military hospitals over the next several months without his commander 's permission , all the while complaining of diarrhea and stomach pains . The precise nature of Orville 's ailment was never fully diagnosed . Only when his exhausted unit returned on August 9 from the front for a leave at Fort Monroe , Virginia , did he feel well enough to rejoin them . Just under a month later , however , as the men of the Sixth Vermont marched off toward South Mountain in Maryland , Orville Fisk disappeared once again . And so , with his comrades on the verge of fighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on September 7 , 1862 , Private Fisk was listed on the company muster rolls first as being " absent without leave " and a month later as a deserter-charged also with stealing his gun and equipment . // Orville convalesced for two months in the General Hospital in Steuart 's Mansion in Baltimore before moving to the Army General Hospital in York , Pennsylvania , where he was eventually taken into custody on February 7 , 1863 , and relieved of his gun and equipment . Orville was then put on a train to Brattleboro , Vermont , to face a court-martial . While all of the military 's records indicated that he had been a deserter since September 7 , 1862 , and little more than a wandering hospital patient prior to that , Orville was somehow able to persuade the military authorities to send him to a convalescent hospital at Fort Wood on Bedloe 's Island in New York . There he remained until May 25 , 1863. // Finally , in June 1863 , the itinerant private , now listed on the muster rolls as being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active military service . But his time with the regiment near and at Gettysburg , at Funkstown , Maryland , and in various locations in Virginia did not change his mind about the desirability of military service . In March 1864 , after reenlisting for another three years as a " veteran volunteer " - entitling him to receive a month 's pay in advance , be promised a bounty of $402 ( sixty dollars of which would be paid immediately ) , and get a month 's furlough home-Orville left for Glover , Vermont , and was never seen by his regiment again . // Knowing that the Union bounty hunters would be looking for him , Orville and his wife packed up all their belongings and traveled thirty miles , past the Canadian border to the tiny township of Bolton Centre in Brome County , Quebec . There , Orville used his reenlistment money and Salome 's savings to pay one hundred dollars for forty acres of land from Elbridge L. Loyal on June 27 , 1864 . While his old army comrades were fighting in such places as Ream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Opequon , Virginia , Orville and Salome built a new home and began farming in Canada . And six months later , in December 1864 , with the men of the Sixth Vermont welcoming a respite from the shooting in their winter camp south of Petersburg , Virginia , the Fisks were welcoming their first child , Alice . Over the next four years , they would be blessed with two other children , May and Walter . // After nearly eight years of life in Canada , in the spring of 1872 Orville and the again-pregnant Salome decided that it would be safe to return to the United States , but only if they moved to the frontier state of Minnesota . Salome 's nephew , E. A. Bickford of Glover , Vermont , had already been lured to the area by the promise under the Homestead Act of 1862 of eighty acres of free land to anyone who would live on and " improve " it for at least five years . Ten years later , the Fisks obtained full ownership of their land in the tiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the growing city of Fergus Falls . // Soon after their arrival , tiny twin girls , Julia and Jennie , were born to the Fisk family on June 24 , 1872 . Julia came to be nicknamed Mite because she was so small that she had to be carried around for months on a pillow and was not able to walk until after her third birthday . Only through exercise and sheer force of will was she eventually able to overcome her physical inadequacy and run " like a deer . " // While Salome raised the children , including her youngest son , Milo , who was born in 1874 , and supported the family by tilling the wheat fields , milking the cows , tending the vegetables , and cutting the firewood , the perpetually sickly Orville went into politics , winning election year after year as the town clerk . Besides keeping the small town 's modest records , Orville spent his time sitting on a rocking chair on the porch of the town hall , telling harrowing stories of his " distinguished " military service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ activity proved to be too rigorous for Orville , as he came down with pneumonia and died at age forty-eight on May 15 , 1885 . The local paper hailed Orville in its obituary as one of the town 's " most prominent citizens " who " took an active and brave part " in the Civil War . // Despite the undistinguished nature of her husband 's military service , Salome came to believe that as a veteran 's widow she had a government pension coming to her . So she hired Washington attorney P. J. Lockwood to file for one on May 18 , 1888 . Despite Salome 's diligent two-year effort gathering supportive affidavits , her petition was denied when the Pension Board discovered that her husband had deserted the army not once but twice . // Not satisfied with this response , in December 1888 Salome instructed her attorney to seek a removal of the desertion charge from her husband 's record in order to reestablish her eligibility for a pension . She argued that her husband had left his post because he " had been sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last one was Brattleboro , Vt . Was sick after he came home his mother was sick and on account of his own health and his mother 's he never went back he was the only child of a widowed mother whose mind was not right " sic . Not only did Salome fail to mention their move to Canada during the war , she also failed to mention that Orville 's sister Emma had been able to care for their mother . Even without these facts , though , the two-man appellate panel in the army adjutant general 's office denied her petition . // While for most people this would have been the end of the issue , such was not the case for the determined Salome Fisk . She commissioned the building of a grand new farmhouse . By the time the masons had finished what was described as " one of the best houses in town , " all the neighbors marveled at what a large pension Orville must have received , providing so well for his family even after his death . // But that did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The oldest son , Walter , would one day inherit the family homestead , so Julia and her sisters each began to chart different courses for their lives . All of them decided to pursue one of the few options open to them : a teaching career . Twenty-one Maine residents , including all the Fisk girls , took the state teacher 's exam on March 7 , 1889 , in order to gain admission to the state-run institute for teachers . A passing grade there would result in the issuance of a teacher 's certificate and eventually a job . // But on October 24 , when the Fergus Falls Weekly Journal proudly listed the dozens of people who had passed the exam , Julia 's was the only Fisk name not among them . She did not then realize that her life had taken a fateful turn . // While her sisters had promising futures , unless she married , Julia 's life was now tied to the family farm . Years later , Julia would repeatedly tell her children , " With a good education you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her own personal experience . While she felt trapped by circumstances beyond her control , the same , she vowed , would not be true for her children . // Just three days after her sisters left for the institute , their younger brother , Milo , then just fifteen years old , began complaining of acute stomach pain accompanied by a high fever and nausea . In a matter of days , the young lad died of peritonitis , a severe inflammation of the abdominal lining . // The loss of her adored little brother deeply affected the devoutly religious Julia . This was God 's will , she said , and Milo was dead because either he or someone close to him had sinned . As a result of this experience , and perhaps also her father 's history , Julia developed an intense fear of stomach troubles . By the middle of April 1890 , when her three sisters had finished their training and left for new teaching jobs in the townships of Gorman , Leaf Lake , and Friberg , Julia seemed destined to live out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother and elder brother . // Julia decided she would develop a life of her own by teaching herself to play the organ . While this did not lead to a paying job , late in the fall of 1894 it brought her to the attention of the most eligible bachelor in town : the new Presbyterian home missionary , William Douglas . // Standing more than six feet tall , this slender , auburn-haired , handsome man possessed startlingly clear blue eyes , like Julia 's father 's , and a soothing baritone voice . A well-groomed full mustache made William look older and more serious than his thirty-seven years . In time , Julia would learn that thus far his life had been no more successful than her father 's military career . He had already pursued several professions in his native Nova Scotia : shoe merchant , traveling evangelical choir member , and , when his throat became inflamed from overuse , dry-goods salesman and part-time minister . After hearing about the great financial opportunities available in California , in early 1894 William had traveled across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business opportunity in the tiny town of Shandon , some two hundred miles south of San Francisco . In a matter of weeks , however , the new business failed , leaving him with only enough money for a train trip back home . // Taking this as a signal from God that retail trade was not his calling , William decided to turn permanently to the business of saving souls . He had heard of a newly established divinity school in Chicago , the Bible Institute of the Chicago Evangelization Society ( later the Moody Bi- ble Institute ) , which had been founded by evangelist Dwight L. Moody , a former shoe salesman like himself . This school was designed to train " gapmen , " lay evangelists who filled the gap between the lay world and the ministry , aiding those who had studied in seminary . // Despite his lack of training and financial resources , William successfully made his application and began his studies in the spring of 1894 . Just one month later , though , he was forced to leave the school abruptly because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's financial stake now allowed him only to complete the journey back to Nova Scotia . // To their surprise and delight , when members of the First Presbyterian Church in Maine , Minnesota , acting on the advice of a nearby minister who had met Douglas in Nova Scotia , contacted him in early September asking if he would like to replace their departing minister and serve other churches in the region as well , with no other job prospects in hand , Douglas said that he could come immediately . So for the fourth time that year , William Douglas packed his meager belongings and boarded a train , seeking his new destiny . // When Douglas arrived in Maine , he began his service as the " stated supply " local evangelist , meaning that he could preach but not serve communion . However , his frail health would not even permit him to do that much . As soon as William arrived in Fergus Falls , he was laid up until late October while his throat recovered from the trip . And after he was able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just two weeks of work that he was forced to return to Dr. McLean 's in Fergus Falls for more treatment . Not until the end of November did the doctor pronounce Douglas fit enough to return to work , but he warned that Douglas 's throat was so weak that he should preach only once a day . For a minister whose duties now extended over several congregations , Douglas knew that this would be impossible . // When he finally began his full-time preaching duties , the pleasant new minister began to take an interest in the church 's organist . //
