Cynics say getting married is a death wish . <p> Now , I 'm no Pollyanna , but I try to ignore cynics . Anyway , what I usually say is that catering weddings is a death wish . My assistant , twenty-two-year-old Julian Teller , and I laugh at that . Yucking it up provides a bit of comic relief within the stress of serving trays of appetizers with drinks , then lunch or dinner with wine , followed by cake with champagne or Asti Spumante-and doing it all quickly-to a hundred guests . Trust me : if there 's one thing caterers need at weddings , it 's comic relief . <p> Unfortunately , the events surrounding Bridezilla Billie Attenborough 's wedding proved the truth of the original axiom . Still , it was n't a death wish that proved troublesome . It was death itself . And as the bodies piled up around the Attenborough nuptials , I began to think someone was gunning for me , too . Turned out , I was right . <p> I 'm always telling my husband , Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I should adore weddings . The reason ? I love being married-to him , that is . With his mountain-man build , handsome face , jauntily parted cider-colored hair , and eyes as green as a faraway sea , he 's not only kind and loving-he 's gorgeous . <p> " You 're prejudiced , " he says . <p> " So what ? " I reply . " You 're still the greatest . " <p> " There are any number of criminals in our state penal system who would take issue with that assessment . " <p> " I 'm not married to one of them . " <p> " Uh-huh . " <p> Actually , having Tom for a husband means I can watch brides and grooms kiss , laugh , and embrace , and I can smile to myself , knowing I 'm going home to a great man . So when there are wedding glitches , I remind myself : I 'm helping people get married . And by and large , this is a good thing . <p> Here in Aspen Meadow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fewer guests at their ceremony and reception , I 'm the caterer of choice , by which I mean , I 'm the only caterer you can choose . Our town also has but one florist , one photographer , one printing press-for invitations and the like-and a few bands . But these days , most couples choose a DJ . <p> Aspen Meadow has one of those , too . <p> If the bride , groom , or either family wants a bigger celebration , she , he , or they usually do all their own arrangements , and have their wedding down in Denver , forty miles to the east . There , you can hire a wedding planner , book a fancy venue , and have your pick of caterers , stationers , florists , even chocolatiers . If you go that route , though , you 're going to pay . What with the gown , limos , and all the rest , you 're probably looking at about a hundred grand . <p> I can remember when a hundred grand used to buy a house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a hundred or fewer guests , I can do all the arranging . Once I 'm given a budget and specifics as to menu , flowers , photographer , music , you name it , I draw up a detailed contract , then get signatures , along with a down payment . After that , I call the vendors , set the schedule , and arrange deliveries . Any changes to the contract mean big bucks , so generally , people are content to leave well enough alone . <p> But Bridezilla Billie , as I 'd come to call her , was never content . Billie 's long-suffering mother , Charlotte , was footing the bill-Attenborough pFre having died of a bleeding ulcer long ago-and Billie seemed not to care that every single new arrangement she was demanding was costing hundreds , if not thousands , of dollars . <p> " It wo n't be a problem , " Billie would say breezily , each time she called in April , then May , then June , to say we absolutely had to have lunch so she could talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put all this on my tab . " <p> And then I would arrive at the appointed time , at whatever place she 'd said she wanted to have lunch . And she would be late , usually more than an hour late . The reason ? She 'd say she 'd gotten lost , never mind that she 'd lived in Aspen Meadow all her life . Or her Mercedes would n't start . Or she 'd thought we were meeting an hour after when she 'd originally said . One time , when she did n't show up at all and I called her house , she said she thought we were meeting the following week . <p> Billie was , in short , a flake . <p> Like most of the weddings I cater , Billie 's ceremony was taking place in the summer . Let the weather cheer you up , I told myself as I typed up contract change after contract change and faxed them through to Charlotte Attenborough . <p> And so I planned and ordered food , and waited for spring , which at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrive until June . By then , the thick crust of ice on our town 's lake has melted . The fresh scent of pollinating pines and newly leafy aspens fills the air . With snow still blanketing the Continental Divide-visible in the distance-the setting is particularly idyllic . <p> But this summer was different . <p> " Maybe I should quit doing weddings , " I told Tom when Bridezilla Billie stopped insisting we have lunch , and instead started phoning me an average of seventeen times a day . She 'd already moved her wedding date twice . The reason ? She said she wanted to lose twenty pounds to fit into a new dress she 'd just bought . She claimed she was working with Victor Lane out at Gold Gulch Spa to get into tip-top shape . Getting into tip-top shape was the euphemism Billie used for trying to sweat off some of her rolls , the kind that had nothing to do with Parker House . <p> Did I know Victor Lane ? Billie asked . Yes , I began , but she tossed her highlighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Key Lime Pie I 'd left on the counter , and cut me off just as she placed an enormous piece of pie on a plate in front of herself . Once she 'd forked up a mouthful , she was eager to provide me with an update on embroidery that was being added to the waist of the new dress . Then I heard about the seed pearls that were being sewn into the train , and the lace now edging the veil . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
