I am hot ! Nothing but net from everywhere . Okay , it 's my driveway and nobody 's got his hand in my face , but this is amazing . Fifteen in a row , the last one from the middle of the street . I wish that jerk who wrote Slow release , slow feet on a scouting report could see me now . When I was little , I slept with my basketball . Mom 's got a picture of me in my Spidey pajamas , both arms around my first Rawlings . Maybe I 'm not the fastest guy in the world , but nobody takes the ball away from me . I wish I did n't have to meet Mary Ann . Or maybe I just wish I did n't have to meet her in the pasture . I for sure ca n't go until I miss . No way am I stopping when I 'm on a run like this . Well ... Nobody could have made that last one . Now I can trudge down there . Up Huron Street , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling-down-on-itself shed where Mr. Tieman kept plow horses about a thousand years ago , cross the barbed wire fence , then pick up the path that zigzags down toward the little stream Teresa used to pretend was the Nile . Oh , man . The view from here used to be so cool : up to my ankles in fescue , big stand of maple trees , and a few cows with those black-and-white sides like seat covers . And now ? More little stakes with more orange ribbons . I come down here at night , pull them up , and throw them away . Next morning they 're back . What do they do-multiply in the dark ? Now they 're almost to the Volvo . Our Volvo . I dial Larry on my new cell . I point like he was right beside me . " Can you believe this ? " " It 's not even ten a.m. , Elliot . I 'm vulnerable . I can believe anything . " " I 'm down in the pasture . Waiting for Mary Ann . What do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bulldozers ? " " That 's lay down , Elliot , and anyway they 'd run over you . Did you finish your Gatsby essay ? " " Teresa 's proofing it . Listen , Mary Ann 's on her way , but where are you going to be in twenty minutes ? " " Twenty minutes ? The girls on The View are right : Romance is dead . " " She said she just wants to talk . " " I 'll be here for a little while . I 'm watching this movie on HBO . " " I 'm gon na call Teresa . I 'll tell her to meet me at your house , okay ? We 'll do something . " " Do n't we always ? " I hit the little End button to finish the call . Larry 's always watching a movie . Or part of one , anyway . He 's funny that way . We 've been friends forever , though . Me , him , and Teresa . They 're the only ones I 've got in my phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her a chance to say anything . " Hey , have you seen the pasture ? " " Hello to you , too . " " Well , have you seen it ? " " Sure , Larry and I tried to figure out how big the lots are . There 's either going to be sixteen castles with room for a few serfs or two hundred and thirty huts with a hog wallow . " " This has been our place since we were kids . " " Honey , if it 's your childhood you 're worried about , I 've got about a thousand pictures of you in war paint , brandishing a bow and arrow . And another fifty of Larry squatting by a fire , stirring imaginary maize in an imaginary pot . " " You know , we should do something . What if we burned the Volvo ? What if we burned all our stuff ? " " Arson 's always fun . " " Hey , you want to hang out at Larry 's in a little bit ? Maybe twenty minutes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're not inviting her to your birthday party , are you ? " My dad 's a butcher , and I am , too , kind of . I know knives . And that question of Teresa 's has got an edge on it . " I mean , do that , " she says , " and your mom 'd start speaking in tongues . " " I 'm just gon na talk to her , then hook up with you guys . " " I 'd watch your step with Mary Ann if I were you . I was surfing the Net the other night , and I 'm pretty sure I saw her on that Naked Nurses Who Kill for Kicks site . She was the one with the deadly bedpan . " " Very funny . See you in a little bit . " I 'm not like Larry and Teresa . I have to do stuff . I ca n't just sit like that naked guy with his chin on his fist and think . So I go look in the Volvo ( okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be ) , and there 's Larry 's Oreos and Teresa 's dictionary and my portable radio so I can get the games from U of I. I grab some kindling and logs out from under the tarp and build a fire right where we always do . It starts slow and smoky at the bottom , then speeds up . I 'd like to build fires for a living . I take off my down vest , roll up my sleeves , and start chopping wood . I 'm good at that , too . I 've got a sharp ax and a wedge . I 'm strong for a point guard . Lean and mean . I show that old log no mercy . " Hey , woodsman ! " I 'm panting and sweaty . My heart is going boom- da-boom . My lungs feel big and clean . I do n't want to stop , so I do n't for a minute . Then I say it : " Hi , Mary Ann . " " Cool fire . " I lay the ax on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I leave . " Do you believe what they 're doing to this place ? " I point . " That old Volvo used to be a stagecoach and a spaceship- " " It 's a wreck now . " Mary Ann took that stud out of her tongue for Christmas , but she 's still a little punked out in her tiny skirt , Doc Martens , ripped stockings ( not the smooth dressed-up-for-church kind but the rough stripper kind ) , and , naturally , purple-and-green hair . She asks , " Want to smoke ? " I tell her , " Maybe one little hit would n't hurt . " She carries joints in a flat tin box with a jaguar on the top . I watch her choose one , going kind of eenie-meenie-minie-moe . She lights up , takes a hugee lungful , settles down in one of the broken-down chairs , passes me the spliff . The dope really helps . Inside of thirty seconds , those piercings in her eyebrows kind of shimmer and her long earrings look like tinsel . I tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ago , and I swear to god I could not miss . I 've been in the zone before but not like that . Have you ever felt like you could do no wrong ? " Her knees are kind of chapped from the cold weather , and there 's a scab on the left one , like when we were seven , everybody got skates for Christmas , and she kept falling down . She does n't look at me when she says , " I just got another D in pharmacology . I could flunk out of community college . How pathetic is that ? " " How many exams are there ? " " All semester ? Like , five , probably . " " Did you study or was it just really hard ? " Mary Ann can be pretty , but she 's not now . " What do you know about trying hard ? " " Hey , I try . " She shakes her head . " Bullshit . Teresa and Larry help you with everything . " " We study together is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She exhales my way . " I do n't get along with my classmates , okay ? They 're , like , intense . They never want to party or do anything except look through a microscope . And they dress weird . " I ca n't help it . I start to laugh . She 's mad for about four seconds , then she does , too . Partly it 's the weed , partly it 's just funny . " Sorry , " she says finally , " about what I said . I know you study . I 'm just jealous or something . " She flounces her little skirt . " I need a new look . I need a new life . Everybody loves my mom at the hospital , okay ? She is , like , you know , Super Nurse . So of course I 'm supposed to ace everything , get my cap , and go to work right beside her . " She does n't want to exhale , so her voice is kind of squeaky . " That 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mom , too . High standards and all that . " " No kidding . And then there 's , you know , these guys I run with , and all they talk about is how empty materialism is , but one of them 's got a two-hundred-dollar Marilyn Manson wristwatch . Is that some kind of irony I do n't get , or is it just stupid ? " I shrug . " Sounds stupid to me . " She leans toward the fire like people do . She just wants to get warm , but with her hands out like that , it looks like she 's trying to push something back . She asks , " When that old car was a spaceship , where were you going ? " " The planet Ampara-this place Larry made up . All kinds of stuff to eat , sunshine all the time , no parents , and if you got bored you just reorganized your cells and were somebody else for a while . " She grins . " I should do that . I should reorganize my cells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grades last year when you were a senior . "
