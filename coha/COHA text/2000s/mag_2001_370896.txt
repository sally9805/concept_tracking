An operation to remove half a child 's brain sounds like something that only a mad  --  not to mention sadistic  --  scientist would dream up . And yet Dr. Benjamin Solomon Carson , a pediatric neurosurgeon at the Johns Hopkins Medical Center in Baltimore , Md. , is neither insane nor cruel . His reason for performing the surgery  --  known as a hemispherectomy  --  is quite compelling . For young patients with rare seizure disorders , it is often their best chance of living a more nearly normal life . <P> Until Carson and his colleagues at Johns Hopkins came along , however , hemispherectomies had largely been abandoned because they so frequently resulted in death . He dramatically increased the chances of success by developing several new surgical techniques . Among them : minimizing the amount of injury to the brain by removing sections a little at a time rather than all at once , and better ways of controlling bleeding and inflammation . <P> Overcoming long odds is something of a hallmark for Carson . Apart from reviving the hemispherectomy , he is world-renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the head . But as inspiring as Carson 's surgical achievements may be , they almost pale before the story of his life . For if Carson had not gone to medical school , he might just as easily have landed in jail . <P> Carson grew up poor in Detroit in the 1950s , and when he was eight , his parents divorced . After he nearly failed the fifth grade , his mother moved swiftly to intervene . She sharply restricted television viewing time for him and his older brother Curtis and required them to submit weekly reports on books they had read ( Carson 's first : Chip the Dam Builder ) . It was n't until years later that the brothers learned that their mother , who left school after third grade , could barely read what they wrote . <P> Her intervention succeeded . Carson soon advanced to the top of his class and dreamed of becoming a doctor . There was a problem , however . As a teenager , Carson would explode with rage whenever he was crossed . One day , while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station without his permission . Carson went berserk and tried to shove a knife into the other boy 's stomach . <P> Fortunately , the blade broke off on the boy 's belt buckle . Horrified by what he had almost done , Carson locked himself in the bathroom . " I started reading the Book of Proverbs , " Carson recalls . " When I came out three hours later , I had a different view of the world . " <P> That view includes strong ideas about the duty of physicians to heal more than just the body . In 1994 Carson and his wife Candy created a scholarship fund for top students in Grades 4 through 12 . " I find that in a lot of schools , kids think it 's not cool to be smart , " Carson says . He would like young scholars to get some of the limelight that 's usually trained on athletes . <P> Meanwhile , back in his lab , Carson is trying to develop new treatments for a type of cancer called brain-stem glioma . The tumor 's location @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those are exactly the kinds of odds that Carson has faced before and beaten .
