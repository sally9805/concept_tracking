. When a 5-foot eastern diamondback sank its fangs into his calf , John Davis could taste the venom . That 's when staying alive became a race against the clock . John Davis had tasted snake before . While on maneuvers out of Fort Carson , Colo. , where he was stationed as an Army medic , he had once stunned a scout unit by catching a prairie rattlesnake barehanded , biting it behind the head , and skinning it with his teeth . Davis had roasted that snake over a sagebrush fire and thought it tasted like alligator . But on November 4 , 2005 , it was not cooked flesh that he tasted . There was a metallic tang in his mouth , the flavor of the venom that in a few heartbeats had pumped from the bite on his right calf to the roof of his mouth . " My lips started to chatter like I had hypothermia , " Davis recalls . " I started to quiver and shake everywhere . " Just moments before , he had felt a tug on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prick of thorns from the blackberry bushes on his 17-acre farm in the Florida Panhandle . Instinctively stepping away , he turned to see a 5-foot eastern diamondback rattlesnake . It was coiled behind the rototiller in his garden , where he had intended to plant a row of shallots before heading to his deer stand for an evening hunt . A two-time survivor of snakebite when he was a young man , Davis , who was 58 , feared that his luck had run out . " I thought I 'd either bit the big one or that the big one bit me , " he says . Unbuckling his belt , Davis cinched it above the fang marks and started to hobble . Home was less than a quarter mile away , but by the time he managed the steps and reached for the phone to call his cousin , James Morris , his body was beginning to convulse and his teeth were chattering so badly he could barely speak . Morris immediately dialed 911 to alert emergency personnel and hurried to Davis ' house , where he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot the snake , which had scarcely shifted a coil in the interim . As he waited for the ambulance , Davis pressed a bag of frozen codfish fillets against his calf and recalled his previous encounters . The first time he was struck he 'd been cane-pole fishing for bream in a cypress swamp , but the small water moccasin had failed to inject venom . The second bite also was from a moccasin , which he 'd snagged at night on a surface plug in Lake Jackson . Falling free of the trebles at the boat , it had bitten him at the base of the thumb . Davis had sculled the boat back to the landing one-handed , and though the wounded hand had swollen to the size of a catcher 's mitt as it trailed in the water , Epsom salts and time were the only medicines he had used for the cure . Davis only had to glance at his leg to know that the third bite , as he put it , was the " charm .

But it was not the leg that worried Davis as much as the taste in his mouth , which told him that the venom had been injected directly into his circulatory system , and the convulsions that bent him double as toxins played havoc with his nervous system . A Life Flight helicopter was dispatched from Perry , and as Davis lay on the stretcher during the flight to Tallahassee Memorial Hospital , his eyes flickered from the lakes and loblolly pine forests where he had spent a lifetime fishing and hunting , to the biohazard bag beside the stretcher , which bulged with the body and severed head of the diamondback . Oddly , he felt no animosity toward the snake . Despite taking a fork to the occasional specimen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More than once , he had run trespassers off his property who were intent on killing them . Now he worried that he might never again see the country that he loved , nor the three dogs that formed his family at the ramshackle farm . It was his cousin 's wife , Betty Morris , who drove to meet him at the emergency room , who offered the first flicker of hope . Seeing how pale and frightened this roughly hewn man had become , she grabbed Davis and told him , " If you were n't such an old bear of a mountain man , I might worry . But you 're going to make it . " He did , but it would take 98 vials of CroFab antivenin ( severe snakebite victims typically receive fewer than 30 ) , consultations with specialists at the Poison Control Center in Denver , and a staggering $322,000 hospital bill . One of the worst diamondback bites recorded in Florida , at least among victims who survived , it also became one of the most celebrated cases the hospital ever treated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bed , and Betty Morris recalls watching dozens of patients and staff tiptoe into the room to gawk , a few of whom ran shrieking down the hall afterward . Finally released after 11 days , most of which for Davis passed in a drug-induced haze , he was readmitted on November 18 , when a checkup at the local VA clinic revealed a plunging platelet count . The anticoagulating properties of the venom still swimming in his blood had thinned it to the point where a razor nick might kill him . Davis , who sported a long beard , guessed it was a good thing he never shaved . Released a few days before Thanksgiving , Davis greeted his dogs hobbling on a walker , with months of rehabilitation to come and instructions to avoid sharp instruments . His right leg , which had resembled a teak log and which doctors initially feared he might lose , eventually returned to humanlike proportions , although the muscle was eaten away and the skin on his calf resembled gator hide . To this day , Davis has to wear a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed before Davis worked up the courage to hunt . Turkey season had arrived , and with it the chance for a new beginning . After all , what were the odds that he 'd be bitten a fourth time ? Still , there was a brand-new pair of snake boots standing inside the door , a late Christmas present to himself , and Davis would make sure to lace them securely before striking out toward the pines . * Average number of venomous snakebites in the U.S. annually : 7,000 * Number of those bites deliberately provoked : 3,000 * Number of fatalities in the U.S. attributed to snakebite annually : 9-15 * Average number of people who choke to death on ballpoint pens in the U.S. annually : 100 * Percentage of bites in which the snake fails to inject venom : Up to 50 * Percentage of annual snakebite victims who are white males between the ages of 19 and 30 : 75 * Percentage of annual snakebite victims who had a blood alcohol level greater than 0.1 : 40 BOX RULES TO LIVE BY 1 GET TO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . 2 DO N'T APPLY a pressure bandage ; it can result in increased tissue damage . Remove any constrictive clothing or jewelry , keep the wounded limb below heart level , and walk calmly . 3 DO N'T TRY TO SUCTION the bite unless you are carrying a Sawyer Extractor , which , if applied quickly , may remove enough venom to reduce tissue destruction . 4 DO N'T PANIC . Doing so will increase your metabolic rate and pump the venom through your system faster . 5 AVOID STRIKES by walking heavily to announce your presence , by not blundering about at night in hot weather , and by watching where you place your hands . Strikes are defensive reactions , not attacks . Reference <p>                     @x Lou Starr was in bed reading , covered to the waist by a sheet . He 'd set the air at sixty-eight and heard the compressor kick on outside . He pushed up the glasses that were falling off the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new Robert Trent Jones PGA golf course called Whispering Palms . <p> <p> He fondled the medallion that was hanging from a gold chain around his neck , resting on a sweater of chest hair . Lou said , " Want to see the best-looking new hole in golf ? " He tilted the magazine toward Karen on the other side of the king-size bed , two feet of mattress between them . <p> <p> Karen did n't say anything . She was propped up on pillows , the bedsheet angling across her chest revealing the pale white skin of her shoulder and the round curve of a breast . She was watching a sitcom on a Sony . at screen that hung on the wall a few feet away . <p> <p> " It 's a six-hundred-yard par five , " Lou said . " Longest one in golf . " He grinned now , imagining himself on the tee looking down the fairway . He took a couple practice swings with his Fusion FT-3 driver and blasted the ball three hundred and twenty-five yards straight down the pike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit his second shot over a bunker and a water hazard  --  on in two . He lined up the putt and sent the ball forty feet over a swale  --  left to right  --  for an eagle . He grinned big and closed the magazine and placed it on the table next to the bed . He took off his reading glasses , put them on top of the magazine and turned off the light . <p> <p> Lou slid over next to Karen , touched her shoulder with his index finger , tracing a line down her arm to her elbow . He was horny . She 'd been putting him off for a couple of weeks . First it was her period . What could he say about that ? Then her allergies kicked in . What allergies ? She 'd never mentioned them before . And the past few nights she 'd been too tired . From what , Lou wanted to know ? All she did was go to the mall while he worked his ass off . He was wondering what he 'd gotten himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he was sure there were monks who got laid more than he did . Well he was going to get some to night . He 'd demand it . <p> <p> Lou moved his hand under the covers , stroked Karen 's thigh , her hip , the smooth round point of her pelvis under the nightie . <p> <p> Karen pushed his hand away . " Come on , Lou . Not now . " <p> <p> " Not now , " Lou said , " when ? " <p> <p> She was watching Pardon My French , this stupid fucking sitcom . Karen said , " Chuck 's getting married . " <p> <p> She sounded like she knew him . " Well , we 're engaged , " Lou said , " in case you forgot . How about my right to a piece of ass every couple months whether I need it or not ? " He slid away from her , rolled over on his side . <p> <p> A few minutes later it was over . He could hear the announcer 's voice say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Levitra . The more you know about ED , the more you 'll want to know about Levitra . " <p> <p> Lou got a kick out of that , Levitra for all the losers who could n't get it up . He was fifty-six and still had a hard-on like a steel post . He glanced at Karen  --  hoping she 'd slip her nightie off and attack him  --  this good-looking woman who was more interested in TV than sex . What was wrong with this picture ? <p> <p> He watched her yawn and close her eyes . The switcher slipped out of her hand and fell on the bed . Her eyes flickered open . She yawned again , picked up the remote and turned off the TV . It was dark , the room was quiet except for the ticking of his clock . <p> <p> He 'd been asleep for some time  --  he was sure of it  --  when he heard the noise . It was loud too , like something breaking , a window maybe , he could n't tell . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned toward Karen . She heard it too , her eyes were big , a nervous look on her face . <p> <p> " What was that ? " Karen said . <p> <p> She sat up and opened the drawer of her bedside table , took out her Airweight .357 and turned toward him . He was bringing the .45 out of his drawer , racking it . They got up with their guns and moved around the bed and went through the doorway into the living room . <p> <p> Bobby saw them come in the dark room , holding guns , barrels pointed up like TV cops . They did n't go together , Bobby was thinking . The guy was short and hairy like a little gorilla . The girl was something though  --  lean and pale with skinny arms and nice jugs he could see hanging under the thin fabric of her nightie . He knew their names , Lou and Karen . <p> <p> Bobby made his move coming in behind them , pointing the .32 , telling them , if they moved , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like he meant it , surprised by the sound of his voice in the quiet room . They bent down and placed their guns on the carpet , and now Lloyd entered from the other side of the room . <p> <p> " Folks , step back here , have a seat , will you ? " Bobby said it friendly and polite , no reason to be rude now that he had their attention . He waved the gun motioning them toward the couch . <p> <p> Lou said , " What the hell do you want ? " <p> <p> " Have a seat over here , we 'll let you know , " Bobby said . <p> <p> Lloyd picked up the .357 and the .45 . Bobby was wondering why these suburbanites were armed in the first place , not to mention with large caliber handguns . Lou grabbed an afghan off the couch wrapped it around Karen 's shoulders and they both sat down . <p> <p> " Come with me , " Bobby said to Karen . She did n't hesitate , got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hey . . . where you taking her ? " <p> <p> Lloyd sat in a chair across from the guy , pointing the .45 at him . <p> <p> Lloyd said , " We catch you and the little lady getting after it ? " <p> <p> " What the hell business is it of yours ? " He was mad letting Lloyd know it . <p> <p> " I 'm making it my business , " Lloyd said . " I got the gun . You did n't wimp out maybe you 'd be holding on me . But you froze like an amateur . " He glanced around the room , checking things out . It was dark , but his eyes had adjusted and he could focus now . The furniture looked like it should be on a porch , not in somebody 's living room , but he liked it . Real comfortable too , bent wood frames with khaki cushions . <p> <p> Neither of them said anything for a while , sitting in silence like strangers on a bus until Lloyd said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real one , " pointing to the zebra skin rug on the floor . <p> <p> " What do you think ? " <p> <p> Lloyd said , " Where 'd you get it at ? " <p> <p> " I shot it , " Lou Starr said . <p> <p> Lloyd said , " You mean like on safari ? " <p> <p> " No , in the backyard . " <p> <p> " I hunt too , " Lloyd said , " with a bow and arrow . " <p> <p> Lou Starr said , " Congratulations . " <p> <p> " What kind of gun you use ? " Lloyd said . <p> <p> " You do n't give up , do you ? " <p> <p> " I was just wondering , " Lloyd said , " that 's all . " <p> <p> " A 30.06 , okay ? You happy ? " <p> <p> Lloyd wondered if the guy was always this grouchy . He was making a real effort to be friendly and it was n't working . <p> <p> In the dressing room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a knockout , red hair and pale creamy skin . He 'd always had a weakness for girls like her . <p> <p> " Do you think I 'm going to overpower you ? " she said . <p> <p> " Huh ? " He was n't paying attention , his eyes staring where the afghan did n't cover her . <p> <p> " The gun , " Karen said . " You do n't have to point it at me . I 'm not going to try anything . " <p> <p> He was surprised she was so relaxed , like people broke in her house in the middle of the night on a regular basis . <p> <p> " Do you mind if I put something on ? This thing itches , " Karen said . She did n't wait for permission ; let the afghan slide off her shoulder onto the floor . She grabbed a robe off a hanger and slipped it on , tying the sash around her waist . <p> <p> There was a framed sign hanging on the wall that read : " Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " There was a photograph of a storefront and the word " Parthenon " in neon surrounded by a silver border of stars . He said , " What 's that ? " <p> <p> " It 's from Lou 's restaurants , " Karen said . " You get one when you eat there . Lou thinks it makes people feel special . " <p> <p> " He make you feel special ? " Judging by the angry look on her face he would 've guessed , no . " What the hell 're those for ? " He was staring at the wig stands , three of them on a shelf  --  two had salt-and-pepper hairpieces on them . <p> <p> " They 're Lou 's . " <p> <p> " No kidding . I thought they were yours . " He glanced at her and felt himself grin . He lifted one of the hairpieces off the stand and studied it . It looked like a furry little creature in his hands . He was going to try it on but did n't want to mess up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " Yeah , " Karen said . " It 's hair from a fourteen-year-old Chinese girl . " <p> <p> " Does he put it on , and get a yen for chop suey ? " Bobby grinned big . He could n't help it . He surprised himself sometimes . <p> <p> " He has them custom-made in London , " Karen said . " The same place Burt Reynolds gets his . " <p> <p> Bobby said , " Burt Reynolds wears a rug , come on ? " <p> <p> " Are you kidding , " Karen said , " his hair looks like it was made by Karastan . " <p> <p> " What 's a custom rug cost these days ? " Bobby said . <p> <p> " They start at $700 and go up from there . " <p> <p> " That 's a lot of money to look like an idiot . Why 's he have three ? " <p> <p> " They 're all different lengths so it looks like his hair 's growing , " Karen said . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyeing the blank wig stand . <p> <p> " On his head , " Karen said . <p> <p> " Duh , " Bobby said . How 'd he miss that ? <p> <p> Lloyd was staring at a framed picture on the end table next to him . The guy across from him was in a safari outfit and there was a dead animal at his feet . Lloyd turned the frame toward him so he could see it . " Look at you . What is that , a lion ? " Lloyd put it back on the end table . " What 's a lion weigh ? " <p> <p> " Three fifty , four hundred , " Lou Starr said . " This one went four twenty-five . " <p> <p> He finally got the grouch 's attention . " Four twenty-five , whoa hoss , that 's a big cat , ai n't it ? " Lloyd grinned at him . " You were in Africa , right ? " <p> <p> " Botswana . " <p> <p> " That 's been a dream of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to carry all the shit , go out every day and hunt . Smoke any of that homegrown they got over there ? " <p> <p> He stared at Lloyd . Maybe he did n't know what homegrown was . Lloyd was just trying to be nice to the guy , making conversation , trying to pass the time and he was being a real dickhead . " Ever hunt whitetail ? " <p> <p> Lou Starr said , " Uh-huh . " <p> <p> He was n't giving him much . " You prefer a tree stand or a blind ? " <p> <p> " Who the fuck cares ? " <p> <p> " Ever got yourself a trophy buck ? " Lloyd said . " One that made book ? I 'm not talking about seeing it while you 're up on a limb . I 'm talking about nailing it , bringing it home . " <p> <p> Lou Starr looked across the living room to the bedroom , glanced at his watch . " That 's it , " he said , standing now . <p> <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a dumbass . Sit down . " <p> <p> He dropped back on the couch , covered his face in his hands . He had a huge diamond ring set in gold on his little finger . Lloyd had n't noticed it before , too busy looking at other stuff . " I like your ring , " Lloyd said . " Always wanted one of those . " <p> <p> " I got an idea , " Lou Starr said grinning . " When you get out of prison , get yourself a job and start saving up . " <p> <p> Bobby stared at a hanger-rack-ful of Lou 's guayabera shirts : white and blue and yellow , reminding him of the shirts barbers wore , same style with the open collar and little vents on the tails . But these had a decorative quality to them and he imagined a roomful of short compact Latin men in the same kind of shirts , dancing and drinking wine . <p> <p> Bobby turned and looked at her . " What nationality is he ? " <p> <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Something Mediterranean , " he said . " Italian or Sardinian . " <p> <p> " I 'll give you a hint , " Karen said . " Lou 's real name is Starvos Loutra . " <p> <p> She was sitting in a chair now , chiseled legs visible , sticking out of the bottom of the robe . <p> <p> " He does n't have a brother named Spartacus , does he ? " He smiled thinking he was funny and she smiled back telling him she did too . " Beware of Greeks bearing gifts , " Bobby said , " and do n't bend over and pick up the soap . That exhausts my knowledge of Greek heritage . " <p> <p> " I 'm impressed , " Karen said . " I can see you 're a real scholar . " <p> <p> Bobby said , " Where 's the money at ? " <p> <p> " What 're you talking about ? " Karen said . <p> <p> " The $9,600 Lou won at the casino . " <p> <p> Karen said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants . " <p> <p> " I 'm not walking out of here empty-handed , " Bobby said . <p> <p> " Do you want to make some real money ? " Karen said . " Two hundred fifty thousand , maybe more . " <p> <p> " What do you think I just fell off the back of a turnip truck ? Do I look that dumb ? " She stared at him and he wondered what she was thinking . " Where 's it at ? " <p> <p> " In a house in West Bloomfield , " Karen said . <p> <p> " Whose house ? " <p> <p> " We can get into all that , " Karen said . " Does this sound like something you might be interested in ? " <p> <p> A quarter mill and a shot at her , hell yes he was interested . But he did n't trust her . How could he ? You did n't break into someone 's house in the middle of the night and expect to get propositioned . He fixed his gaze on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> <p> " No , " Karen said .
