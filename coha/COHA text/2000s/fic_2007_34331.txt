Down and Out " Moggle , " Aya whispered . " You awake ? " Something moved in the darkness . A pile of dorm uniforms rustled , as if a small animal stirred underneath . Then a shape slipped from among the folds of spider silk and cotton . It rose into the air and floated toward Aya 's bed . Tiny lenses gazed at her face , curious and alert , reflecting starlight from the open window . Aya grinned . " Ready to go to work ? " In answer , Moggle flashed its night-lights . " Ouch ! " Aya squeezed her eyes shut . " Do n't do that ! It 's vision-wrecking ! " She lay in bed another moment , waiting for the spots to fade . The hovercam nuzzled against her shoulder apologetically . " It 's okay , Moggle-chan , " she whispered . " I just wish I had infrared too . " Lots of people her age had infrared vision , but Aya 's parents had this thing about surge . They liked to pretend the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wait until they turned sixteen to change themselves . Crumblies could be so fashion-missing . So Aya was stuck with her big nose  --  definitely ugly  --  and her normal vision . When she 'd moved out of her home and into a dorm , her parents had given her permission to get an eyescreen and skintenna , but that was only so they could ping whenever they wanted.Still , it was better than nothing . She flexed her finger and the city interface flickered to life , layering across her vision . " Uh-oh , " she said to Moggle . " Almost midnight . " She did n't remember dozing off , but the tech-head bash must have already started . It was probably crowded by now , packed enough with surge-monkeys and manga-heads that nobody would notice one ugly extra snooping around . Besides , Aya Fuse was an expert at being invisible . Her face rank was proof of that . It sat unmoving in the corner of her vision : 451,396 . She let out a slow sigh . In a city of a million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own feed for almost two years now , had kicked a great story just a week ago , and was still anonymous . Well , tonight was finally going to change that . " Let 's go , Moggle , " she whispered , and slipped out of bed . A gray robe lay in a shapeless puddle at her feet . Aya pulled it over her dorm uniform and tied it at the waist , then perched on the windowsill . She turned to face the night sky slowly , easing one leg , then the other , out into the cool air . She slipped on her crash bracelets , glancing at the ground fifty meters below . " Okay , that 's dizzy-making . " At least no monitors were skulking around down there . That was the kick thing about a thirteenth-story room  --  no one expected you to sneak out your window . Thick clouds hung low in the sky , reflecting worklights from the construction site across town . The cold tasted of pine needles and rain , and Aya wondered if she was going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly throw a dorm jacket over the robe and expect people not to notice . " Hope you 're all charged up , Moggle . It 's drop-time . " The hovercam drifted past her shoulder and out the window , settling close against her chest . It was the size of half a soccer ball , sheathed in hard plastic and warm to the touch . As Aya wrapped her arms around Moggle , she felt her bracelets trembling , caught in the magnetic currents of the hovercam 's lifters . She squeezed her eyes shut . " Ready ? " Moggle shivered in her arms . Clinging to the hovercam with all her strength , Aya pushed herself into the void . Getting out was much simpler these days . For Aya 's fifteenth birthday , Ren Machino  --  her big brother 's best friend  --  had modified Moggle . She 'd only asked him to make it quick enough to keep up with her hoverboard . But like most tech-heads , Ren took pride in his mods . The new Moggle was waterproof , shockproof , and powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Close enough , anyway . With her arms wrapped around the hovercam , she fell no faster than a cherry blossom twirling toward the ground . It was much easier than stealing a bungee jacket . And except for the nervous-making moment of jumping , it was kind of fun . She watched the windows flicker past  --  dreary rooms full of standard-requisition squalor . No one famous lived in Akira Hall , just loads of face-missing extras wearing generic designs . A few ego-kickers sat talking into their cams , watched by no one . The average face rank here was six hundred thousand , despair-making and pathetic . Obscurity in all its horror . Back in the Prettytime , Aya vaguely remembered , you just asked for awesome clothes or a new hoverboard and they popped out of the hole in the wall like magic . But these days , the hole would n't give you anything decent unless you were famous or had merits to spend . And getting merits meant taking classes or doing chores  --  whatever the Good Citizen Committee commanded , basically . Moggle 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Aya bent her knees , rolling as she hit . The wet grass squished beneath her like a sodden sponge , soft but shivery cold . She let go of Moggle and lay for a moment on the rain-soaked earth , letting her heartbeat slow down . " You okay ? " Moggle flashed its night-lights again . " Okay ... that 's still blind-making . " Ren had also modified the hovercam 's brain . True AI might still be illegal , but the new Moggle was more than just a wedge of circuitry and lifters . Since Ren 's tinkering , it had learned Aya 's favorite angles , when to pan and zoom , and even how to track her eyes for cues . But for some reason , it did n't get the whole night-vision thing . She kept her eyes closed , listening hard as she watched the spots across her vision fade . No footsteps , no whir of monitor drones . Nothing but the muffled thump of music from the dorm . Aya rose to her feet and brushed herself off . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Reputation Bombers dressed to disappear . The robe was hooded and shapeless , the perfect disguise for party-crashing . With a twist of a crash bracelet , a hoverboard rose from its hiding place in the bushes . Stepping on , Aya faced the glittering lights of Prettyville . Funny how everyone still called it that , even if most of the residents were n't pretty anymore  --  not in the old sense , anyway . Prettyville was full of pixel-skins and surge-monkeys , and plenty of other strange new fads and fashions . You could choose among a million kinds of beauty or weirdness , or even keep your natural-born face your whole life . These days " pretty " meant whatever got you noticed . But one thing about Prettyville was still the same : If you had n't turned sixteen , you were n't supposed to go there . Not at night , when all the good stuff happened . Especially if you were an extra , a loser , an unknown . Gazing at the city , she felt engulfed by her own invisibility . Each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who had never heard of Aya Fuse . Who probably never would . She sighed , urging her hoverboard forward . The government feeds always said that the Prettytime was gone forever , freeing humanity from centuries of bubbleheadedness . They claimed that the divisions among uglies , pretties , and crumblies had all been washed away . That the last three years had unleashed a host of new technologies , setting the future in motion again . But as far as Aya could see , the mind-rain had n't changed everything .... It still pretty much sucked , being fifteen . TECH-HEADS " Are you getting this ? " she whispered . Moggle was already shooting , the shimmer of safety fireworks reflecting from its lenses . Hot-air balloons swayed over the mansion , and revelers screamed down from the rooftops in bungee jackets . It looked like a party back in the old days : self-indulgent and eye-kickingly radiant . At least , that was how Aya 's older brother always described the Prettytime . Back then everyone had gotten one big operation on their sixteenth birthday . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving you brain-missing and easily controlled . Hiro had n't been a bubblehead very long ; he 'd turned sixteen only a few months before the mind-rain had arrived and cured the pretties . He liked to claim that those months had been awful  --  as if being shallow and vain was such a stretch for him . But he never denied that the parties had been awesome . Not that Hiro would be here tonight ; he was way too famous . Aya checked her eyescreen : the average face rank inside was about twenty thousand . Compared with her older brother , the people at this bash were total extras . Compared to an ugly ranked at half a million , though , they were legends . " Be careful , Moggle , " she whispered . " We 're not wanted here . " Aya flipped up the hood of her robe , and stepped out of the shadows . Inside , the air was full of hovercams . From Moggle-size all the way down to paparazzi swarms , each cam no bigger than a champagne cork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crazy people and kick new gadgets . Maybe people were n't as beautiful as back during the Prettytime , but parties were a lot more interesting : serious surge-monkeys with snake fingers and medusa hair ; smart-matter clothes that rippled like flags in a breeze ; safety fireworks skittering along the floor , dodging feet and sizzling incense as they passed . Tech-heads lived for new technologies  --  they loved showing off their latest tricks , and kickers loved putting them on their feeds . The endless cycle of invention and publicity bumped everyone 's face rank , so everyone was happy . Everyone who got invited , anyway . A hovercam buzzed close , almost low enough to peek in at Aya 's face . She lowered her head , making her way toward a cluster of Reputation Bombers . Here in public they all kept their hoods up , like a bunch of pre-Rusty Buddhist monks . They were already bombing : chanting the name of some random member of the clique , trying to convince the city interface to bump his face rank . Aya bowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ugly face covered . The whole point of bombing was to dissect the city 's reputation algorithms : How many mentions of your name did it take to crack the top thousand ? How quickly did you drop if everyone stopped talking about you ? The clique was one big controlled experiment , which was why they all wore the same anonymous outfits . But Aya figured most Bombers did n't care about the math . They were just cheaters , pathetic extras trying to talk themselves famous . It was like how they 'd manufactured celebrities back in Rusty days , a handful of feeds hyping a few bubbleheads and ignoring everybody else . What was the point of the reputation economy , if someone was telling you who to talk about ? But Aya chanted away like a good little Bomber , keeping her attention on her eyescreen , watching the view from Moggle 's lenses . The hovercam drifted over the crowd , picking out faces one by one . The secret clique Aya had discovered had to be here somewhere . Only tech-heads could pull off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nights before , riding on top of one of the new mag-lev trains , traveling at insane speeds through the factory district  --  so fast that all the shots Moggle had taken were too grainy and blurry to use . Aya had to find them again . Whoever kicked a crazy trick like mag-lev riding would be instantly famous . But Moggle was already distracted , watching a gaggle of NeoFoodies underneath a pink blob floating in the air . They were drinking from it with meter-long straws , like astronauts recapturing a spilled cup of tea . NeoFoodies were old news  --  Hiro had kicked a story about them last month . They ate extinct mushrooms grown from ancient spores , made ice cream with liquid nitrogen , and injected flavors into weird forms of matter . The floating pink stuff looked like an aerogel , dinner with the density of a soap bubble . A small blob broke off and floated past . Aya grimaced , smelling rice and salmon . Eating strange substances might be a great way to bump your face rank , but she preferred her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though , even if she had to hide . Most of the city was still stuck in the past , trying to rediscover haiku , religion , the tea ceremony  - -  all the things that had been lost in the Prettytime , when everyone had been brain-damaged . But tech-heads were building the future , making up for three centuries of missing progress . This was the place to find stories . Something in her eyescreen sent a flicker of recognition through her . " Hold it , Moggle ! " she hissed . " Pan left . " There behind the NeoFoodies , watching with amusement as they chased down stray bloblets , was a familiar face . " That 's one of them ! Zoom in . " The girl was about eighteen , classic new-pretty surge with slightly manga eyes . She was wearing a hoverball rig , floating gracefully ten centimeters above the floor . And she had to be famous : A reputation bubble surrounded her , a cohort of friends and groupies to keep extras away . " Get close enough to hear them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bubble , and soon its microphones caught the girl 's name . Data spilled across Aya 's eyescreen .... Eden Maru was a hoverball player  --  left wing for the Swallows , who 'd been city champions last year . She was also legendary for her lifter mods . According to all the feeds , Eden had just dumped her boyfriend because of " a difference in ambition . " Of course , that was just code for " she got too famous for him . " Eden 's face rank had hit ten thousand after the championship , and what's-his-name 's was stuck at a quarter million . Everyone knew she needed to hook up with someone more face-equal . But none of the rumors mentioned Eden 's new mag-lev riding clique . She must be keeping that a secret , waiting for the right moment to reveal the trick . Kicking it first would make Aya famous overnight . " Track her , " she told Moggle , then went back to chanting . *** Half an hour later , Eden Maru headed out . Slipping away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yoshio Nara " about a million times . She hoped Yoshio enjoyed his pointless face rank bump , because she never wanted to hear his name again . From Moggle 's midair view , Eden Maru was slipping through the door  --  alone , no entourage . She had to be headed off to meet her secret clique . " Stay close to her , Moggle , " Aya croaked . All that chanting had left her throat dry . She spotted a drinks tray hovering past . " I 'll catch up in a minute . " Grabbing a glass at random , Aya guzzled it down . The alcohol sent a shudder through her  --  not exactly what she needed . She snatched another drink with lots of ice and pushed her way toward the door . A gaggle of pixel-skins stood in her way , their bodies rippling through colors like drunken chameleons . She slipped among them , recognizing a couple of their faces from the surge-monkey feeds . A little reputation shiver went through her . Out on the mansion steps Aya spilled the drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tipped the glass back into her mouth and started crunching . After the sweltering party a mouthful of ice was heavenly . " Interesting surge , " someone said . Aya froze .... Her hood had fallen back , revealing her ugly face . " Um , thanks . " The words came out muffled , and Aya gulped down cold shards of ice . The breeze hit her sweaty face , and she realized how fashion-missing she must look . The boy smiled . " Where did you get the idea for that nose ? " Aya managed to shrug , suddenly word-missing . In her eyescreen she could see Eden Maru already flying across town , but tearing her gaze from the boy was impossible . He was a manga-head : eyes huge and glistening , his delicate face inhumanly beautiful . Long , tapered fingers stroked his perfect cheek as he stared at her . That was the weird thing : He was staring at her . But he was gorgeous , and she was ugly . " Let me guess , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really . " She touched her nose , swallowing the last few shards of ice . " It 's more , um ... randomly generated ? " " Of course . It 's so unique . " He bowed . " Frizz Mizuno . " As Aya returned the bow , her eyescreen displayed his face rank : 4,612 . A reputation shiver went through her , the realization that she was talking to someone important , connected , meaningful . He was waiting for Aya to give her own name . And once she did that , he 'd know her face rank , and then his wonderful gaze would turn somewhere more interesting . Even if in some logic-missing , mind-rain way he liked her ugly face , being an extra was simply pathetic . Besides , her nose was way too big . She twisted a crash bracelet to call her hoverboard . " My name 's Aya . But I kind of ... have to go now . " He bowed . " Of course . People to see , reputations to bomb . " Aya laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . I 'm not really ... I 'm sort of incognito . " " Incognito ? " His smile was eye-kicking . " You 're very mysterious . " Her board slipped up next to the stairs . Aya stared down at it , hesitating . Moggle was already half a kilometer away , trailing Eden Maru through the darkness at high speed , but part of her was screaming to stay . Because Frizz was still gazing at her . " I 'm not trying to be mysterious , " she said . " It 's just working out that way . " He laughed . " I want to know your last name , Aya . But I think you 're purposely not telling me . " " Sorry , " she squeaked , and stepped onto the board . " But I have to go after someone . She 's sort of ... getting away . " He bowed , his smile broadening . " Enjoy the chase . " She leaned forward and shot into the darkness , his laughter in her ears . UNDERGROUND Eden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard gear for hoverball players , but most people never dared to wear them . Each piece had its own lifter : the shin and elbow pads , even the boots in some rigs . One wrong twitch of your fingers could send all those magnets in different directions , which was an excellent way to dislocate a shoulder , or send you spinning headfirst into a wall . Unlike when you fall off a hoverboard , crash bracelets would n't save you from your own clumsiness . But none of this seemed to worry Eden Maru . In Aya 's eyescreen , she was zigzagging through the new construction site , using the half-finished buildings and open storm drains as her private obstacle course . Even Moggle , who was stuffed with lifters and only twenty centimeters across , was finding it tricky keeping up . Aya tried to focus on her own hoverboarding , but she was still half-hypnotized by Frizz Mizuno , dazzled by his attention . Since the mind-rain had broken down the boundaries between ages , Aya had talked to plenty of pretties . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked to you after they got the operation . But no pretty had ever looked at her that way . Or was she kidding herself ? Maybe Frizz 's intense gaze made everyone feel this way . His eyes were so huge , just like the old Rusty drawings that manga-heads based themselves on . She was dying to ask the city interface about him . She 'd never seen him on the feeds , but with a face rank below five thousand , Frizz had to be known for something besides eye-kicking beauty . But for now Aya had a story to chase , a reputation to build . If Frizz was ever going to look at her that way again , she could n't be so face-missing . Her eyescreen began to flicker . Moggle 's signal was fading , falling out of range of the city network as it followed Eden underground . The signal shimmered with static , then went dark .... Aya banked to a halt , a shudder passing through her . Losing Moggle was always unnerving , like looking down on a sunny day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last image the hovercam had sent : the inside of a storm drain , grainy and distorted by infrared . Eden Maru was curled up tight , a human cannonball zooming through the confines of the tunnel , headed so deep that Moggle 's transmitter could n't reach the surface anymore . The only way to find Eden again was to follow her down . Aya leaned forward , urging her hoverboard back into motion . The new construction site rose up around her , dozens of iron skeletons and gaping holes . After the mind-rain , nobody wanted to live in fashion-missing Prettytime buildings . Nobody famous , anyway . So the city was expanding wildly , plundering nearby Rusty ruins for metal . There were even rumors that the city planned to tear open the ground to look for fresh iron , like the earth-damaging Rusties had three centuries ago . The unfinished towers flashed past , the steel frames making her board shudder . Hoverboards needed metal below them to fly , but too many magnetic fields made them shivery . Aya eased back her speed , checking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underground . A huge excavation came into sight , the foundation of some future skyscraper . Along its raw dirt floor , puddles of afternoon rain reflected the starlit sky , like jagged slivers of mirror . In a corner of the excavation she spotted a tunnel mouth , an entry to the network of storm drains beneath the city . A month ago , Aya had kicked a story about a new graffiti clique , uglies who left artwork for future gener-ations . They painted the insides of unfinished tunnels and conduits , letting their work be sealed up like time capsules . No one would see the paintings until long after the city collapsed , when its ruins were rediscovered by some future civilization . It was all very mind-rain , a rumination about how the eternal Prettytime had been more fragile than it seemed . The story had n't bumped Aya 's face rank  --  stories about uglies never did  --  but she and Moggle had spent a week playing hide-and-seek through the construction site . She was n't afraid of the underground . Letting her board drop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diving toward the tunnel mouth . She bent her knees , pulled in her arms , and plunged into absolute blackness .... Her eyescreen flickered once  --  the hovercam had to be nearby . The smell of old rainwater and dirt was strong , trickling drainage the only sound . As the worklights behind her faded to a faint orange glow , Aya slowed her board to a crawl , guiding herself with one hand sliding along the tunnel wall . Moggle 's signal flickered back on ... and held . Eden Maru was standing upright , flexing her arms . She was someplace spacious and dead-black in infrared , extending as far as Moggle 's cams could see . What was down there ? More human forms shimmered in the grainy darkness . They floated above the black plain , the lozenge shapes of hoverboards glowing beneath their feet . Aya smiled . She 'd found them , those crazy girls who rode mag-lev trains . " Move in and listen , " she whispered . As Moggle drifted closer , Aya remembered a place the graffiti uglies had bragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ runoff from the rainy season , an underground lake in absolute darkness . Through Moggle 's microphones , a few echoing words reached her . " Thanks for getting here so fast . " " I always said your big face would get you into trouble , Eden . " " Well , this should n't take long . She 's just behind me . " Aya froze . Who was just behind Eden ? She glanced over her shoulder .... Nothing but the glimmer of water trickling down the tunnel . Then her eyescreen faded again . Aya swore , flexing her ring finger : off/on ... but her vision stayed black . " Moggle ? " she hissed . No flicker in the eyescreen , no response . She tried to access the hovercam 's diagnostics , its audio feed , the remote flying controls . Nothing worked . But Moggle was so close  --  at most twenty meters away . Why could n't she connect ? Aya urged her board forward slowly , listening hard , trying to peer through the darkness . The wall slipped away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around her . Trickles of rainwater chorused from a dozen drains , and the damp presence of the reservoir sent chills across her skin . She needed to see .... Then Aya remembered the control panel of her hoverboard . In this absolute darkness , even a few pinpricks of light would make a difference . She knelt and booted the controls . Their soft blue glow revealed sweeping walls of ancient brick , patched in places with modern ceramics and smart matter . A broad stone ceiling arched overhead , like the vault of some underground cathedral . But no Moggle . Aya drifted slowly through the darkness , letting the subtle air currents carry her board , listening hard . A smooth lake of black water spread out a few meters below her board . Then she heard something nearby , the slightest catch of breath , and turned .... In the dim blue glow , an ugly face stared back at her . The girl stood on a hoverboard , holding Moggle in her arms . She gave Aya a cold smile . " We thought you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What did you do to my  --  " A foot kicked out from the darkness and sent Aya 's hoverboard rocking . " Watch it ! " Aya shouted . Strong hands pushed her , and she took two unsteady steps backward . The hoverboard shifted , trying to stay under her feet . Aya stuck her arms out , wobbling like a littlie on ice skates . " Knock it off ! What are you  --  " From all directions , more hands shoved and prodded her  --  Aya spun wildly , blind and defenseless . Then her board was kicked away , and she was tumbling through the air . The water struck her face with a cold , hard slap .
