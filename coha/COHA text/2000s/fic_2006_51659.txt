WE CALLED HER MISS FABULOUS , although her real name was Miss Fabaldon , because when she checked your writing or listened to your reading , she would touch you on the shoulder and say , Those are fabulous kicking kings you 've written today , Nzuzo . Or she 'd take your hand and look you in the eye saving , You read like a superstar , Moses . Her eyes were the color of melted chocolate , her arms the color of milk . She would share the pickle from her sandwich with me . It made my heart flutter . <p> The choir sang at her wedding , so some of us got to see her new husband , Mr. Rumboll . He was short , much shorter than she , but when he took her hands in his , she seemed to become tiny , and disappear . At the organ , the music teacher rendered " Love Divine , All Loves Excelling , " and we remembered to breathe deeply , to support with our diaphragms , to drop our jaws , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Miss Fabulous . <p> By the end of the year her eyes were more the color of discarded coffee grounds , and she would forget to eat her sandwich , even when I asked her about the pickle . She started wearing scarves around her neck , and long sleeves . Once I peeked through her blouse where a button had popped open . I saw her breast under her lacy bra . Her skin was n't like milk anymore , more like yellow green stains . When we read to her she would say , Good , in a flat voice . When she marked our writing , she 'd write , Nice . When Moses called her Mrs. Grumble behind her back , I started to cry . She never touched us on our shoulders anymore . Once , I hugged her and she pushed me away , saving , Ow , be careful , kiddo . <p> Author Affiliation
