Malcolm He thought about the rabbits sometimes , lying awake at night in the little room in Ella 's house , under the eaves . It had been back in West Lansing , when he was twelve years old , just after his mother had taken ill and they had all been split up . A Sunday afternoon in the late fall , nearly winter . The smell of something burning off in the distance . The men and boys walking through the yellowed grass , holding the straining dogs tight on their leashes . Malcolm was walking with Mr. Gohannas and Big Boy , dangling the .22 off his hip , trying to whip it all about like he 'd seen the gunfighters do in the Western serials . He held it to his eye and aimed it here , there , even at the backs of the men around him , until one of them turned and caught him . " You watch that gun , boy , " he scolded . " Do n't you be pointing it at nobody ! " Malcolm had dropped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up furtively now at the other men to see if they had noticed his shame . All of them darker than he was , their skin the color of burnt coffee or railroad coal , faces lined and creased like worn car seats . Wearing their field overalls and work boots , redolent with the scent of men 's sweat and dirt . Some of them with their boys next to them  --  wearing their handed-down overalls ; faces exactly the same only smoother , as if all the creases had been ironed out . Their ragged hair knotted up in burrs and tangles , like the farmers they were and would always be . " Get ready now , " Mr. Gohannas told them , his voice urgent though still kindly . " Right ' bout here  --  " The men stopped at the edge of an open field . At its far end Malcolm could make out a tangled clump of bent scrub trees , and thorn bushes . The men looked at each other , a few of them nodding solemnly , then they let the dogs go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . " Here they come now ! " The loosed dogs had run straight toward the thicket , baying and scuffling their way in past the lowered tree branches . There was silence for a few , long moments  --  then the renewed sound of pounding feet , as the first rabbits flew out from the bushes . Lean , gray , winter hares , leaping ahead with their eyes wide and their long ears back , the dogs scrambling after them . " Easy now , " the man nearest to Malcolm whispered tenderly to his son , a boy younger than Malcolm was , toting a shotgun . " Let them come back  --  " Leaving the hounds still immersed in the brambles , the hares made a wide , panicked bolt around the perimeter of the field . Running so fast and hard that Malcolm thought they must surely escape  --  the only sound their powerful , widened winter feet thumping softly over the grass . He could not understand why the men had n't fired , all these old , slow , black men still staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run after the rabbits . But then he felt Mr. Gohannas 's hand on his arm , pulling him back down  --  and sure enough , the hares turned and headed back , toward their hidey-holes in the thicket . " Now ! " the man next to him exclaimed , and his boy fired the crude old shotgun . The blast knocked him flat on his back but the birdshot picked off one of the galloping hares in midair , flipping his thin gray rabbit body head over heels , leaving him to twitch and heave on the ground . The rest of the men and boys fired at nearly the same time  --  a fusillade from all their battered , ancient guns that stunned and nearly deafened Malcolm . He shut his eyes , and lowered his head against the noise . When he looked up again he could see five or six more hares on the ground . The younger boys already running out to claim theirs , picking them up by their long ears and smashing their heads with lengths of lead pipe if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and his stomach turn over . " Here now , " Mr. Gohannas told him , placing a gentle hand on his chest and turning him around . The dogs were already flushing the thicket again , and a few minutes later out came more hares . Running slower and a little raggedly this time , if just as frightened . For all of their fear they ran in the exact same direction , around the edge of the field . Making the same long loop back to their homes , the men firing and yelling exultantly as they turned . Malcolm fired wildly himself , his shot rustling the branches in some nearby trees , the men nearest to him snorting in surprise and indignation  --  " Where you shootin ' , boy ? "  --  but he had an idea now . The dogs went in to flush the hares a third time  --  both dogs and hares moving noticeably slower now  --  and after he reloaded Malcolm scrambled out of the blind before Mr. Gohannas could stop him , Big Boy calling plaintively after him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was already running up along the border of the field , his cracked , patent leather city shoes slipping along the dead winter grass . He ran to a spot that was halfway along the hares ' trajectory , as best he could figure it , just before the point where they were bound to turn and head back to their thicket . He heard the alarmed shouts of the men behind him , but he ignored them . Kneeling and aiming carefully this time , taking down one hare , then another , before they ever got back within range of the rest of the hunters . The exhausted creatures always flipping over the same way , their long back feet catapulting them over in one final , cinematic somersault . When the shooting stopped it was Malcolm who ran out after them this time , plucking his hares up by their big ears . Ignoring the continuing , angry shouts of the older , blacker men  --  smiling to himself , to think how he had been able to figure it out when the rest of them had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Gohannas among them , his wide , brown face looking uncomfortable behind his spectacles .
