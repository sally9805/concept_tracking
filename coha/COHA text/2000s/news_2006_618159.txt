<p> The Georgia High School Association 's stance against adopting a statewide heat-related policy since the death of a 15-year-old football player is wavering in the midst of growing criticism from state lawmakers . <p> Rockdale County High School football player Tyler Davis collapsed July 31 after practice and died the next morning . The cause of death was heatstroke , which has sparked debate about what role high school athletics ' governing body should play in determining when it 's safe to practice . <p> The GHSA has addressed the issue through education and coaching clinics . Now , executive director Ralph Swearngin said , the association is discussing rule changes that would require schools to have a written heat policy and a scientifically accepted device on the field to measure heat and humidity . The changes , if approved by the board of trustees , would be voted on by the GHSA 's executive committee at its meeting Aug. 28 . <p> Last week , Swearngin addressed the state General Assembly 's Athletic Overview Committee , created to give lawmakers a forum for discussing GHSA operations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lack of a policy regarding practicing in extreme heat . Soon after , the GHSA released the plan to require written policies and heat-monitoring devices . <p> While it makes a nod to lawmakers ' concerns , it does n't call for statewide standards  --  which some committee members suggested . <p> Sen. Judson Hill ( R-Marietta ) , co-chairman of the committee , questioned continuing to let coaches or school administrators make the decision on when it 's safe to practice . <p> " The local folks always have better personal knowledge of a specific situation ; however , the local folks also are impacted by local pressures , demands and competition . It can maybe jeopardize the health of students , " said Hill , who added he would rather the GHSA handle the issue than have the committee push for legislation . <p> Swearngin said it 's best to keep the heat-policy decisions with schools . <p> " We still believe the local school people on that site , on that day , know more of what they have to do if they have good information than we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " What we 're trying to do is keep the same philosophy , but just kind of follow up to make sure it 's being followed properly at the local level . " <p> Swearngin argues that a " one-size-fits-all " heat rule does n't adequately cover all kids . Finding a standard that is appropriate for the varied temperatures from Valdosta to North Georgia is n't possible , he said , especially when there is n't a consensus in the medical community as to what temperature range is safe to conduct practice . According to the National Federation of State High School Associations , no association in the country has statewide rules regarding practicing in heat . <p> Georgia lawmakers , who say they will have to answer to parents in their districts , contend the GHSA is responsible for setting standards to help protect student-athletes . <p> The creation of the High School Athletics Overview Committee during this year 's legislative session , follows a history of the Legislature intervening when it disagrees with GHSA rules . In 2005 , the lawmakers passed the Ryan Boslet bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2003 died from a heart condition during an offseason workout . The law requires parents to have doctors fill out more in-depth and standardized physical exam forms for athletes . <p> A law passed last year allows public prayer at private schools before athletic events . The GHSA had opposed prayer over loudspeakers during sanctioned playoff games . <p> This year , pressure from proposed legislation by Sens . John Wiles ( R-Kennesaw ) and Jim Whitehead ( R-Evans ) , pushed the GHSA to stop multiplying private schools ' enrollment by 1.5 when figuring athletic classification . Starting in 2008 , private schools will compete against public and private schools of similar enrollment . <p> Also this year , legislators passed a law to protect the high school eligibility of any athlete who participated in a national all-star or showcase event . <p> Sen. John Douglas ( R-Covington ) , whose district includes part of Rockdale , is on the high school athletics committee . He said rules used by Marines while training in the heat could be a model for schools . <p> " It needs to be addressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's not hard to mandate at all . If the Marine Corps can do it , I would think we could do it in the borders of Georgia . If you have a policy in place that says if it 's 95 degrees , you take 10 minutes to drink water and sit in the shade . How difficult is that ? " <p> It 's difficult , Swearngin said , because determining which temperature or wet bulb reading signals unsafe conditions is debated by medical experts . <p> Even if practice stops when the temperature reaches 95 degrees , a player could suffer a serious injury at 90 degrees . Or 85 degrees . Much depends on the individual player and where he competes , Swearngin said . <p> For instance , Camden County football coach Jeff Herron said his South Georgia players are more used to high temperatures than those in North Georgia . " If they told us we could n't practice when it was higher than 95 , we 'd never get to practice , " Herron said . <p> Valdosta coach Rick Tomberlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision be left to individual coaches . <p> Mike Ferrara , a professor of kinesiology and program director for athletic training at the University of Georgia , has been looking at the relationship between heat injuries and environment for nearly three years . <p> He 's working on a report , funded by the NCAA and the National Athletic Trainers ' Association , that examines sports at 50 schools across the country and studies player health in high temperatures . <p> " At this point , we just do n't have the data to say , ' Here 's the line , ' " Ferrara said . There 's even disagreement within the scientific community , he said , about whether the heat index or a wet bulb , which measures heat and humidity , is more effective in determining the level of danger . <p> Amid this debate , the Georgia Athletic Trainers Association plans to present recommendations on statewide rules to the GHSA within a month . <p> GATA President Lori Groover said the news of Davis ' death " shot up so many red flags . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death occurring , " Groover said . " Rules need to be in place , and they can be done statewide . <p> " You can look at ... timing of practices , length of practices , acclimation that needs to be implemented , " she said . " Stuff like that can be mandated across the state . " <p> ON AJC.COM <p> * Do you think there should be a statewide policy ? Go online to express your opinion .

Graphic : HOW SCHOOLS DEAL WITH HEATMetro Atlanta high schools have different approaches to dealing with the heat while on the field . Most keep defibrillators on hand . Some school systems require heat-monitoring devices ; others leave it up to individual schools . The most popular devices , the Digital Sling Psychrometer  --  or wet bulb  --  and the Heat Index Monitor gauge both heat and humidity . Also , some schools have " co-op " trainers , not employed by the school but under contract to attend practices and games . See what your school does : ... Heat ... Certified TrainersSchool ...
