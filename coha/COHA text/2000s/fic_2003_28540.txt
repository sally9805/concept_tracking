Chapter One Heaven . On her skis at the three-thousand-foot mark , Molly Porter paused beyond the lift station , pushed her goggles to her forehead and scanned the horizon in her usual deliberate manner . First to the left , then to the right , her eyes absorbed what Mother Nature had provided . A smile tugged at Molly 's mouth . Beauty . Today she was surrounded by beauty . Snow-covered mountains glistened in the bright winter sun . Virgin snow mostly , pristine white blankets barely marred by skiers ' tracks . Overhead in the never-ending sky , small , fluffy clouds were scattered across the field of blue . Molly blinked back incipient tears . No artist could reproduce this panorama that so touched her soul . She sighed with pleasure as she snapped a mental picture of the view , then tucked the memory away and shifted her attention to the challenge ahead . No , not this slope . The run down this mountainside would be for sheer pleasure , a time-out to mentally prepare herself to win the gold . Olympic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself . She dug her poles into the hard-packed snow , shifted her weight and started her run , dreaming of what the medal would mean to Diamond Ridge , her family 's ski resort in Vermont . Mom and Dad would burst with pride , but her sister and brother-in-law would couple their cheers with an advertising campaign to grow the business yet again . At the base of the mountain Molly checked her watch and quickly caught up with the rest of her teammates . Respect , affection and loyalty had already bonded them into a unit . An American unit , seeking a medal sweep for the United States . They were competitors , every last one of them . They were athletes , healthy and strong , both physically and mentally . She grinned at her friend Julie , who jabbed repeatedly at her watch . " Sorry , " said Molly . " I needed my own space for a minute . " " Find your own space later , " Julie replied . " Now get ready for a timed run . " Julie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they made their way to the lifts . " Not to worry , Jules , " said Molly . " I am ready . I 've been ready for twenty-two years , my whole life . Centered and focused . Even have my number on . " Molly pointed at her vest , where the number six stood a foot and a half tall . " Jeez , I do n't know why I worry about you , " Julie grumbled . " You 've already posted the fastest time during our trial runs so far . And you 're always in total control . " " Is that a polite way of saying I 'm a control freak ? " Molly laughed , unconcerned about the answer . Control was the name of the game when the game was played at seventy miles an hour or more . " Nah , " said Julie . " Maybe I wish I had a little extra . " Molly glanced at her friend and squeezed her shoulder . " There 's nothing wrong with you or your skiing . In fact , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A moment passed before Julie answered . " Thanks , Molly . Coming from you , it means a great deal . " Coming from her ? Molly shrugged . She was n't the captain of the Olympic team as she 'd been of her high-school team . And Julie had only known her since they 'd met at the nationals two years ago . But Molly was used to leadership , of taking the initiative . If she could inject a fraction more confidence in the other girl , so much the better for everyone . " Our turn , " Molly said , slipping onto the chairlift and leaving room for Julie . " Look , " she said seconds later , pointing at some men with video equipment riding the big cats partway up the hill . " Seems like we 're being filmed today . " " Does it bother you ? " asked Julie . " Of course not , " Molly replied , a little surprised at the question . " I 'm so focused on my skiing I do n't even notice . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like to study myself later . If I can increase my speed even a fraction of a second by doing something a little differently , I 'll do it . " " I know , Molly , " Julie said . " We all know . " Then Julie grinned . " And we all do the same thing . " Molly returned her friend 's smile . Skiing at top form was their job . It was definitely her goal . She was at one with the mountain , in Vermont , in Colorado or here in Lake Placid , New York , at the Olympic Training Center . In every season of the year she ran to the mountains - climbing , hiking or skiing . During every school break from college during the past two years , she would first visit her family and then head to the sky-high summits . She craved that time , that space . Her older sister , Amanda , understood it best because she 'd run to the mountains , too , years ago , when she 'd needed solitude . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start house and waited for her turn , after Julie . She spoke to no one . Instead , she stood near the entrance , goggles in place , and studied the terrain . Little by little , the people and noise around her faded until she was in her own world , concentrating only on the mountain , on what she was born to do . " Porter , get ready . " Molly nodded , stepped to the start gate and leaned forward into position . " Ready ... set ... go ! " She shot down the slope , legs pumping , skis gliding , picking up speed with every stroke against the snow . The wind whipped her cheeks as she banked into each turn , pushing and pushing , hoping her skill , along with gravity , would take a second or more off her time . She hit sixty miles an hour , sixty-five , then seventy by the halfway point . She was on ! Might even establish a new personal best . Shifting her weight , she took a turn , then headed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn . What the ... ? Ice . Hidden ice . Her skis chattered and slid . Applying pressure to catch an edge , Molly leaned over hard . And then everything happened at once . Her skis slipped out from under her , catapulting her into a backward somersault . Her shoulder slammed into the slope , the skis now above her head . Ice tore at her cheek as she continued to slide down the mountain . Roll with it ! Roll with it ! She twisted to get control . Too fast . She was spinning too fast . Head over heels , she pinwheeled . Her legs tangled . One ski off , one ski still on . She could n't breathe . Over and over , cartwheeling , banging her head against the hard-packed snow . Her vision dimmed , blackened . Inhale ! Blinking as she hurtled down the hill like an out-of-control missile , she glimpsed the orange safety fence looming in front of her , a virtual brick wall . Good-bye , family . I love you .
