Section : COVER STORY The defense secretary is a blast from the past who is the man of the hour <p> Who 's the " star " of this war so far ? That 's a vulgar consideration , given the awful work that has to be done . But there is , undeniably , an answer : Don Rumsfeld . Yes , Rumsfeld : defense secretary , TV personality , sex symbol ( no kidding-more on that in a second ) , role model , inspiration . As one Washington arbiter puts it , " Rummy " is the man now . The man to whom the nation turns , the man to whom it listens . Nearly everyone-Republican or Democrat-sees him as the right guy at the right time in the right job . <p> One longtime Rumsfeld friend explains its nicely-and in decidedly Rummyesque fashion : " We 're not playing pitty-patty anymore . We have a foe that 's proven deadly . People look for a different kind of person to run Washington-as far away from the Clinton type as you can get . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's mounting . Consider a few facts : <p> <p> Reports have it that people gather round to watch Rumsfeld press conferences the way they do Oprah . <p> <p> One Hollywood grande dame , hostess of a prized post-Oscar party , says to another Hollywood grande dame , " I 'll call you in the morning . " The second dame replies , " Okay , but be careful : Rumsfeld 's on at 9:45 . " <p> <p> Women confide that they have ... well , un-defense-policy-like thoughts about the secretary of defense . Not just older women , either , and not just stiff-haired Republicans : young ones , liberal ones , whatever . Larry King is moved to ask Rumsfeld about his new status as sex symbol . Says Rumsfeld , " Oh , come on . For the AARP , perhaps . I 'm pushing seventy years old . " Yeah , so ? <p> <p> A journalist who 's a perfect parody of a liberal-reflexively so-duly thinks that John Ashcroft is the devil incarnate . But she confesses : " I love Rumsfeld . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumsfeld something of a cult figure , or rather , acknowledges his status as such . Its parody of a Rumsfeld press conference is wildly successful . " Rumsfeld " makes the reporters look ridiculous , responding bluntly and tartly to not-so-bright questions . It 's not every day that this show makes a Republican military official look with-it , the press corps not . <p> And so on . Rumsfeld is definitely the man of the hour , a classic American type returned to do a hard duty . He is direct , decent , and clear . It does n't hurt him , either , that he is , indeed , a " handsome Joe , " as my grandmother would say . Rumsfeld is this war 's pin-up , its Betty Grable . <p> Which drives certain Rumsfeld staffers slightly nuts , of course , because the SecDef-SexDef ? - is a terribly serious guy , overseeing a terribly serious operation , and all this " star " talk is just style , image : but the style and image are n't necessarily disconnected from the exigencies and obligations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a throwback . That 's the word that keeps coming up in reference to him : " throwback . " He 's a reminder of the Greatest Generation-though he 's about a half-generation younger than that-at a time when Greatest Generation grit and clarity of purpose are called for . He 's not fighting on the battlefield , risking life and limb ; but he is **29;1454;TOOLONG who do , as civilian leaders often must . <p> You can get too sociological about this , but Rumsfeld is the anti-Alda . In a feminized society-whose idea of a male sex symbol has been the Brad Pitt-style pretty boy-he is a relief , or a rediscovery . He has walked out of Father Knows Best , or some WWII flick . And just as he 's the anti-Alda , he is-as everyone says-the anti-Clinton . The ultimate anti-Clinton . Whereas Clinton was a pain-feeler , Rumsfeld is more a pain-inflicter , at least where the country 's enemies are concerned . And he must be the most uneuphemistic person alive . He is totally immune , and allergic , to " spin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't like to be spun . He sees it in a second , and you 're dead if you try to do it . And he does n't spin other people . " TALK ABOUT A ' NO-SPIN ZONE ' <p> Ask most serious reporters and other keen types what they like about Rumsfeld-or even think of him-and they 're liable to answer , " He tells the truth . " Simple as that . Says one veteran newsman , " I 've spent the better part of my life covering public officials , and on matters of policy-irrespective of party-most of them , when they 're giving a briefing , cover their a** . That 's why briefings are opaque , why they have all the spontaneity of a kabuki dance . But Rummy never dodges , never shucks . He does n't say , ' I 'll have to take that under advisement . ' He just comes at you straight . " <p> Rumsfeld himself seems to be obsessed with the truth . Early in the war , he wrote in an op-ed piece , " Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But in this war , the first victory must be to tell the truth . " He loves to admit what he does n't know , and loves to tell you what he does know . He 'll usually do so in " throwback " language . Featured in his lexicon are " golly , " " holy mackerel , " and " dadburn . " Speaking of U.N . and American inspectors in Iraq , looking for the worst , he said , " We could n't find beans , and it 's there , and we know it 's there . " He spoke of " getting al-Qaeda and the Taliban the dickens out of Kabul and the rest of the country . " " Beans " ; " dickens " - it goes with the Vitalis-friendly hair . ( Remember Vitalis ? ) <p> People are trading favorite Rumsfeld comments , and they 're almost impossible not to repeat . Asked whether the U.S. was running out of targets in Afghanistan , he said , " We are n't running out of targets ; Afghanistan is . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days before , when " it looked like nothing was happening , when it looked like we were in a-all together , now-quagmire . " <p> And he is almost deliriously unhesitant about using what National Review 's Kate O'Beirne refers to as " the K-word " : kill . Why , asked a reporter , are we using such heavy bombs ? " They are being used on frontline al-Qaeda and Taliban troops to try to kill them . " Oh . Rumsfeld even goes out of his way to use the K-word , abhorring euphemisms : " We have not been able , thus far , to stop them , that is to say , kill them . " A Pakistani minister in Islamabad told the New York Times , " I am sorry to put it in this way , but Rumsfeld 's been extremely callous . " He has also been extremely realistic . <p> In his communications with the public , certain things come up , again and again . Rumsfeld bridles at suggestions that the U.S.-or Israel-is engaged in " retaliation " or " retribution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It 's simple self-defense . " The only way to defend against terrorists is to go after the terrorists . " He is relentless on the subject of what the war will require . Tim Russert asked him ( on December 2 ) , " You think we have a few months of long , bloody battle ? " Said Rumsfeld , " Oh , I would n't limit it to that . " He continually describes war as a " dirty job " -a " tough , long , grinding , dirty business . " He also warns of casualties : " certain " casualties . How about collateral damage , the accidental killing of innocents ? The terrorists ' fault : They 're the ones who started and necessitate this war . Rumsfeld emphasizes the newness , the strangeness , of the conflict , wherein " there is n't any army we can go out and defeat , no navy we can sink , no air forces we can shoot out of the sky . " There will be no " exit strategies " in this one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Missouri . " <p> And he constantly reminds people of what the terrorists did on September 11 , as though worried that someone may forget . " They have done a terrible , terrible thing , and have vowed to do it again . We ca n't let them . " <p> One of his many jobs in government was envoy to the Middle East , under Reagan . His understanding of the Arab-Israeli conflict is both breathtakingly simple and profound . He says , " There are many people in that part of the world who 'd love to shove Israel into the sea , and not have it be there , and until people are willing to accept the presence of Israel , Israel obviously is not going to be able to make a deal . " We are talking about " a very small country that does n't have a big margin for error . " Those sentences are worth about ten books by big-newspaper Middle East correspondents . <p> For me , a perfectly emblematic Rumsfeld moment came in that earlier-mentioned interview with Larry King . Here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of candor , and of an unbending logic . Larry asked him , " Is it very important that the coalition hold ? " This seems a no-brainer : Yes ( most people would say ) . But Rumsfeld squints his eyes , with those granny glasses , screws up his face , and-in a tone soaked with incredulity and exasperation-says , " No . " He goes on to explain that coalitions come and go according to a particular task , and that " the worst thing you can do is allow a coalition to determine what your mission is . " <p> Some people-Rumsfeld admirers-worry that he 's spending too much time on television , when , after all , he 's got both a war and a mammoth , problematic department to run . But others say that this war needs such a communicator , especially because it is a peculiar , confusing war . Besides which : Who else can do this , like that ? WHO 'S LAUGHING NOW <p> When George W. Bush asked Rumsfeld to return to the Pentagon-he 'd been defense secretary under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This was " throwback , " indeed , and not the positive kind . Rumsfeld was n't even one of " Poppy " ' s boys ! He was a Nixon-Ford guy ! The taunts of New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd sum up the now-ancient thinking about Rumsfeld . She dubbed him " Rip Van Rummy , " rudely woken up after 25 years out of government . He was-get this- " clueless about the press " ( who are Stradivariuses in his hands ) . " You can just hear Rummy slugging back a Scotch with Cheney in the Oval after they 've put the Kid Bush to bed , grousing about the gazillion dollars ' worth of investments he has to sell to avoid a conflict , and growling : ' Real men can drink twice that much arsenic . ' " ( Ah , yesteryear , when the greatest threat to us was that Republicans would poison the water supply . ) <p> Tunes have changed-and Rumsfeld stalwarts , while tickled , are a little annoyed at the new , positive Rumsfeld image . He has always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the press , and the change-resistant generals , and congressional anti-SDI-ers did n't like it . The common line now is , " Rumsfeld was n't much of a secretary of defense , but he 's a helluva secretary of war . " This disgusts the Rumsfeldites , who argue that their guy has been , more than anything else , vindicated . <p> Long before it was cool , Rumsfeld was advocating a lighter , fleeter , more flexible , post-Cold War military ( so was George W. Bush ) . A military adapted to protect against unseen phantoms of the night . In front of the Armed Services Committee , in June , Rumsfeld said , " We can not know precisely who will threaten us in the decades ahead . But while it is difficult to know precisely who will threaten us , or where , or when , it is less difficult to anticipate how we will be threatened . We know , for example , that our open borders and open societies make it easy and inviting for terrorists to strike at our people where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 11th itself , before the planes hit , Rumsfeld was in his office , admonishing congressmen about the dangers of terrorism . For months ( and years ) , he had cautioned against complacency , against sitting around " fat , dumb , and happy . " He would talk of the need for " homeland defense " : and the very words would cause eyes to roll . <p> Today , Rumsfeld staffers take pains not to say " I told you so " - their boss would be all over them " like ugly on ape , " as the first Bush used to say-but sometimes it slips out . <p> These staffers are proud to work for Rumsfeld , and they enjoy the reaction they get when they tell people-just folks-where they work , and for whom . Rumsfeld is the central-casting tough-but-inspiring boss . One aide says , " You 're scared to death to go in there to Rumsfeld 's office and not perform properly . After you get to know him , there 's a lot of banter and a lot of fun . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got ta be on your toes . You learn as a staffer to do it right . He trains you . It takes about twice . " <p> Rumsfeld is famously a nut about precision : precise words , precise thoughts , precise actions . A story is told from the 1996 Dole campaign that is semi-legend . ( For this story , please bear in mind that Rumsfeld was chairman-sort of a figurehead chairman-of that campaign , and that , in the years after he left the Defense Department , he 'd run the pharmaceutical company Searle . ) Rumsfeld has a recent law-school grad working as his secretary . The guy-green , un-Rumsfeldized-screws up somehow , and Rumsfeld gives him what-for . He lectures him as follows : " You must learn to be precise . In the drug business , if I 'm imprecise , people will die . In the Pentagon , if I 'm imprecise , people will die . " The poor kid left the office shook , but he did very well from then on . Rumsfeld became a benefactor , securing for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to mimicking Rumsfeld 's tongue-lashing , to the delight of all , including the chairman himself . It became kind of a giddy buzz phrase on a generally joyless adventure : People will die ! <p> The respect you hear expressed for Rumsfeld is startling . It is n't sycophantic ; it is deeply held . Vin Weber , the former congressman and now multipurpose Washingtonian , says , flatly , " He 's the best man in government . " So do others . Weber says , " He 's the one guy about whom I 've thought-more than about anyone else-'It 's really too bad he was n't president . ' " Plenty of others say the same thing . <p> Rumsfeld seems a man completely in possession of himself . He 's close to-one would think-the end of a long and honored career . He 's not nervous about what other people think of him ; he 's not afraid to lose his job ; he 's not looking to move up , to continue climbing the greasy pole . He is free-freer than most-to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's seen as a dour type-and seems to revel in being a bearer of bad news , or a reminder of the present grimness-he 's also an optimist , pointing toward ultimate victory . Constantly , he stresses the need to " hang in there , " to see it through to the end . Under Nixon , he was ambassador to NATO , and , speaking of this time , he has said , " In the early Seventies , I 'd have to fly back to testify against the amendments to reduce forces in Europe and to pull out of Europe and to give up and throw in the towel . We 'd win by three , four , five votes . But here we are : No Soviet Union . " <p> Rumsfeld-as much as the president-is the face of American determination in this war . Over the years , he has collected what he calls " Rumsfeld 's Rules , " for succeeding in government , business , and elsewhere . One of them is , " The most underestimated risk for a politician is overexposure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overexposed . But as the bombs are falling overseas and the home front is tense , most people seem to be saying : more , more , more . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) <p> By Jay Nordlinger <p>
