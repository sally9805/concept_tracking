It seems to be the fate of certain best sellers  --  the ones that propose to reveal the secrets of life in seven easy steps  --  to live on not for the lessons they impart but as poignant reminders of a cultural period . How to Win Friends &; Influence People evokes a time of polyester salesmen tooling through leafy suburbs in aqua Buicks , hawking insurance policies and vacuum cleaners . Jonathan Livingston Seagull takes us back to an era when vegetarians in Earth Shoes tramped the countryside stalking the wild asparagus . Easy to read and easier to forget , they are books we look back on shaking our heads in amusement and disbelief . Were we ever really that small , that innocent ? <P> Indeed , we were , and we continue to be . Consider this year 's ubiquitous insta-scripture , Who Moved My Cheese ? , a 94-page handbook on success that currently tops three major best-seller lists  --  those of the Wall Street Journal , Publishers Weekly and USA Today . The work of M.D. turned management guru Spencer Johnson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the book has become the literary pet rock of the new economy . <P> Accounting for this phenomenon is n't easy . The book 's promised simple but powerful message turns out to be the same simple but powerful message shared by every best seller of its category : Change is n't everything ; it 's the only thing . Embrace change ; do n't fight it . What 's different about the book , and what explains its vast appeal , perhaps , is its kindergarten imagery . There 's cheese , see , which represents what people  --  in this case characters named Hem and Haw  --  truly , deeply desire . People get frustrated when the cheese is moved . Instead of standing around and griping , though , people need to get busy finding new cheese , like the mouse characters in the book , Sniff and Scurry . Get it ? Of course you do . You already knew it . <P> Yet by overstating the obvious , Johnson has sold more than a million copies of Cheese at $19.95 each  --  he keeps half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mini-industry that includes pens , coffee mugs and other trinkets . And there is expensive Cheese for corporations  --  the Cheese Experience , a half-day learning program for $895 , and the Cheese animated movie , at $495 . <P> And why not ? To corporate America , discussing the mobility of dairy products sure sounds a lot less threatening than terms such as restructuring , re-engineering and outsourcing . Durk Jager , chief executive of Procter &; Gamble , a company in the midst of a huge overhaul , posted a notice on the employee website recommending it . Lew Platt , former head of Hewlett-Packard , endorsed it in a speech . Larry Johnson , CEO of the Bank of Hawaii , handed out 4,000 copies to staff members and asked them to discuss the story with their managers . Says he : " Our objective was to try and condition employees as much as possible for the changes that were under way and the changes that lay ahead . " How did the staff react ? " Not every person in the organization jumped onto this as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included layoffs , this is not surprising .
