<p> Health insurance : Patients are more than a statistic <p> Piedmont Hospital and Blue Cross are fighting ( " Patients ca n't stop this malpractice , " Editorial , July 9 ) . Why should we be surprised ? <p> Medicine has become a business  --  a big business . It should have become obvious when , 20 years ago , the insurance forms changed the signature portion of their forms from " physician " to " health care provider . " <p> As patients we no longer have adequate control over our own care . As physicians most of us have only partial control over the care our patients receive . Can you imagine calling some sweet-sounding individual to get " permission " to perform a needed test for a patient ? He or she looks in their little code book , generally with absolutely no understanding of the exam , and then very nicely tells the physician , " Oh no , that test is not indicated in our code book . " <p> Now it 's all about money . Blue Cross is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockholders . <p> Shame on Blue Cross , but also shame on Piedmont Hospital . Is it bargaining away its reputation of taking excellent care of its patients ( or " clients " or " consumers , " as they now are called ) ? <p> Piedmont and Blue Cross need to sit down and remember that they exist for the purpose of giving patients the best health care possible at a reasonable cost . <p> Dr. JERALD L. WATTS , Peachtree City <p> Universal Rx is best in profit tug-of-war <p> If ever there was a case for a single-payer national health care system , it is being made by the contract negotiations between Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Georgia and Piedmont Hospital . While an insurance company focuses on its profits and a hospital system worries about executive compensation , patients get the shaft . <p> Why should the health and even the lives of patients be held hostage to money ? Medical care should not be a for-profit activity , for it is basic to life itself . It is the proper function of a government that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of government dollars in the form of Medicare , Medicaid and state-sponsored insurance plans for children and the poor . Moving to a single-payer system would not be as expensive as opponents assert , considering the insurance premiums , co-pays , and other out-of-pocket expenses that consumers now bear . <p> It is time to take the greedy insurance companies , hospital administrators and physicians ( whose education taxpayers largely fund ) out of the equation . Only a barbaric system would subject the health and lives of millions of people to the not-so-tender mercies of a profit and compensation-driven group of individuals . <p> ERNEST L. MARTIN , Roswell <p> Illegal immigration : Responses to Cynthia Tucker 's column " Chambliss , tag illegal hiring  --  not citizenship , " @issue , July 9 <p> Senator simply for cheap labor <p> Cynthia Tucker nails Georgia 's historical addiction to cheap labor . U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss ( R-Ga. ) , in denouncing federal action against illegal workers in the Vidalia onion fields in 1998 , was protecting Big Business , not workers . <p> I have no doubt that Chambliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preserve states ' rights , but he would have been defending Georgia 's source of free labor . He might have defended Jim Crow laws as a means of helping a virtuous white Christian society to persevere , but he would have been defending Georgia 's source of cheap labor . He might have even stood against the civil rights movement , claiming to defend law and order , but he would have been defending Georgia 's source of cheap labor . <p> Today Chambliss stands against legal status for 11 million illegal immigrants , claiming we are a nation of laws , but he is really defending Georgia 's source of cheap labor . <p> EUGENE HERNANDEZ , Stockbridge <p> Politicians use border security as excuse <p> Bravo to Cynthia Tucker for telling the truth about illegal immigration ! It 's frustrating that there 's so little honest discourse on this subject . <p> If you want to crack down on illegal immigrants , workplace enforcement is the obvious answer . But politicians such as U.S. Sens . Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson do n't want to really do anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to keep exploiting the cheap labor . The pols have to look as though they 're doing something , though , so they support walling off Mexico  --  a horrendously expensive program that would do nothing but increase the danger of crossing and get more Mexicans killed . <p> All politicians who prattle on about border security are either fools or demagogues who regard their constituents as fools . <p> CHRIS MOSER , Lithonia <p> Playing the race card weakens argument <p> For a moment I thought Cynthia Tucker was on to something : the idea that government could do something about the illegal immigration issues by cracking down on the businesses that hire them would likely gain traction with the public if presented in a compelling way . It might even gain the support of those Tucker refers to as the " ultraconservative base " of Sen. Saxby Chambliss were her remarks not so mean-spirited and insulting to those of us who likely fall into the group she attempts to describe . <p> I actually believe that the approach she mentions is sensible and moderate enough for Democrats to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Republicans would not be able to support a version of it . <p> Unfortunately , rather than intelligently presenting the argument for addressing illegal hiring , Tucker instead attempts to turn the discussion from the immigration issue toward race . By trying to play the race card , she immediately loses credibility with the folks who could actually influence Chambliss and Johnny Isakson to support a more moderate approach to the issue . <p> I have come to expect Tucker 's claims of racism and largely ignore them . While she occasionally , albeit rarely , shows something of fairness in her remarks , Tucker does a great disservice to this issue by race-baiting . <p> Of course , addressing the real issue is not her purpose , now is it ? <p> CHRIS SANCHEZ , Powder Springs <p> Solutions must take into account the economic consequences <p> Cynthia Tucker 's column is really about hypocrisy . While talking up strict enforcement , politicians are listening to the whispers of businessmen who are worried about loss of the illegals they employ . Sill , there are important economic questions involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debate , but are not . <p> If you consider the possibility that all 10 million to 12 million illegals were suddenly to leave , there would be significant economic consequences . Here are some of the questions we should be asking : <p> * If the illegals are given permanent status , or citizenship , would they still want to work at the menial , low paying jobs in which they are concentrated ? <p> * What would happen to poultry processors and agricultural industries , such as Vidalia onions , if the illegals were to leave ? Could replacements be hired ? Would the salaries of replacements have to be higher ? Would that push up the prices of poultry and produce ? Would that lead to inflation ? <p> * Would some of those industries no longer be able to compete with foreign growers ? What would happen to rural communities , say in Middle Georgia , if that were to happen ? <p> * What would happen to businesses that cater to the illegal immigrants  --  groceries , service stations , pharmacies ? <p> Tucker is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stem illegal immigration , but we also have to deal realistically with these economic issues . <p> LARRY HYMO , Athens <p> Unbiased information available to the public <p> In response to " Voters weary of dueling attack ads " ( Page One , July 9 ) , there is one source Georgians can rely on for unbiased information on candidates seeking office  --  the League of Women Voters of Georgia . For 86 years , the league has provided unbiased , nonpartisan information to address one of the main reasons people choose not to vote  --  a lack of information on candidates and where they stand on the important issues . <p> Through use of the league 's statewide Voter Guide , voters can make educated choices at the ballot box . Throughout the state , the League of Women Voters also provides locally hosted candidate debates and issues forums and a staffed office to assist voters with any questions or needs . <p> All of this is accomplished with no ulterior political motive ; the only motive the league has is working to strengthen our democracy through increased citizen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Chamblee , is executive director of League of Women Voters of Georgia . <p> Darfur tragedies need more outcry , coverage <p> The United States , the United Nations and the world are ignoring the ongoing slaughter of tens of thousands of people and the forced relocation of millions in the Darfur region of Sudan ( " Dressing in Darfur , " @issue , July 9 ) . <p> Primarily Arab tribesman are being recruited and supported by the government of Sudan in this slaughter of black Africans . Yet , where is the outcry from the African-American community ? Further , where is the outcry from the Arab world , which is so quick to criticize Israeli efforts in Gaza and U.S. efforts in Iraq ? <p> We are not blameless . If our international goal is to stop " evildoers , " should n't the United States be involved in Darfur  --  versus Iraq ? And , finally , why have n't the media , the AJC included , given this subject more space and more main coverage ? <p> The world knew of the genocidal murder of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem to be on that path again . <p> JACK BERNARD , Monticello <p> Give voters solid facts , not just conversation <p> The Page One story " Voters weary of dueling attack ads " ( July 9 ) is , through a notable omission , a disservice to Georgia voters . Some voters may want to know what the polls say about the upcoming primary , and some voters may have gotten the impression that the interviews conducted by AJC reporters of Georgia voters amount to research . They do n't . They are , at best , chats with interesting people . <p> These conversations may make a terrific human interest story , but they do n't come close to being a serious , statistically valid examination of the opinions of Georgia voters . I know that , the AJC knows that , and the article should have told readers that . <p> MARK JOHNSON , Mableton <p> Military , free speech : Responses to " Soldier tests free speech limits , " @issue , July 9 <p> Soldiers should maintain rights <p> The Army and some legal experts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not have the right " to openly criticize the war in a way that would be contemptuous toward a superior officer , including the commander in chief . " This means that soldiers have lost their rights as citizens . <p> How can soldiers vote if they can not be critical of the central political issue of the day  --  the war ? Can they vote but not discuss the issues or be critical of one or the other politician ? Should we not expect the opposite  --  that soldiers should have more rights than anyone to be critical of this illegal and immoral war that may cost their lives ? <p> During the Vietnam War , active duty soldiers marched in anti-war demonstrations . There were anti-war newspapers put out by active-duty GIs , and there were peace organizations for them . <p> While we profess to be fighting for freedom and democracy , we continue to take these rights away from our own people . <p> JOE LOMBARDO , Albany , N.Y . <p> Remember , oath taken voluntarily <p> As is typical with journalism on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's story only from the perspective that holds the government at fault . The article fails to emphasize that the lieutenant voluntarily joined the U.S. Army . After 1973 all such affiliations have been totally voluntary . In the process , the lieutenant took an oath and pledged to obey the commander in chief and all officers appointed over him . <p> And , yes , as the article obliquely mentions , behavior to the detriment of good order and discipline is a violation of the Uniform Code of Military Justice . But the most egregious violation of the code is failure to obey a lawful order . For this primarily , but the lesser violations as well , Watada must be subjected to a court martial . <p> Personally , I think Watada is a coward . But since the AJC and its kind are against the war , it swings the emphasis of Watada 's story over to freedom of speech . <p> GORDON R. PRENTICE , Macon <p> Soccer and the U.S. <p> It 's booming  --  and it 's American <p> The charge in Mike Tierney 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The American dream  --  with a kick , " Page One , July 9 ) . Soccer was brought to this country by European immigrants . The U.S. Soccer Federation was founded in 1913 . And soccer was here long before that . Indeed , soccer is one of the best things the immigrants brought to this country . <p> Soccer is as American as apple pie . <p> The canard that soccer is un-American is wielded by those involved in so-called traditional American sports , who feel threatened by the growth of soccer . In terms of the number of participants , soccer has blown past baseball and football , and only a shortage of fields prevent soccer from overtaking basketball . <p> KEITH WATKINS , Atlanta <p> True allegiance to their native Africa ? <p> I read with interest the quotes from various Americans concerning their team loyalties in the World Cup soccer competition ( " Wild fun of World Cup scores with Atlanta fans , " News , July 9 ) . Most of these were born and raised in foreign countries but have become citizens of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country . <p> If you happen to converse with a stranger and detect a foreign accent , you might inquire as to where the person is originally from . The answer may be Brazil , Germany , Finland , Thailand , India , South Africa , China or a hundred other countries around the world . Seldom does a person simply say they are from Africa . Yet , millions of dark-skinned individuals with no distinguishable accent ( other than colloquial ) , whose ancestors have lived here for generations , identify themselves as " African-American . " And there are dark-skinned people in Haiti , Colombia and other non-African countries , but these folks are identified as Haitian , Colombian , etc . You might refer to a person as South American , but I do n't think I have ever heard someone identified as " South American-American . " So , why African-American ? <p> To quote the king of Siam , " T is a puzzlement ! " <p> BOB GRAYSON , Cumming <p> Nardelli must step up his vision , leadership <p> The interview with Home Depot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that believes in transparency , ' " Business , July 9 ) should have been titled , " Nardelli believes in invisibility . " <p> Is there any question why Home Depot 's stock has languished over the course of Nardelli 's tenure ? Nardelli is just now getting around to the investment community with his vision for Home Depot . It 's going on six years ! <p> Investor confidence is about the image and the vision of a company as much as it is about double-digit sales and earnings growth . Leadership is about communicating that vision . The same people who shop at Home Depot 's dirty and cluttered stores should , conceivably , buy the company 's stock . But after spending thousands of dollars at Home Depot , these loyal customers go out and buy stock in Google instead . <p> Nardelli was a second banana at General Electric and was considered not fit to succeed , so he moved on to another stage . Unfortunately , he is still acting like a second banana at Home Depot . <p> Act like a guy getting top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JACK McCARTHY , Cumming
