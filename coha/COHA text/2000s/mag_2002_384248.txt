Home Improvement Journal COMPARISON TEST We test nine tractors to find the one that 's a cut above . Photograph Photograph // * There 's a reason that tractors in the 15- to 17-hp range account for the vast majority of tractor sales . These machines are essentially oversize riding lawnmowers . For homeowners who want a tractor to cut lots of grass , but not necessarily plow snow and till soil , these machines are the way to go.That was the idea behind our recent test in which we put nine tractors through their paces . Each machine has either a 16- or a 17-hp engine that is either a single-cylinder or a twin-cylinder type . Each has a hydrostatic transmission and a deck in the 42- to 48-in. range . The thing that we most wanted to know is how effectively the machines can cut grass and discharge it out the side of the deck . Sure , some people bag , others mulch , but the average homeowner wants a side  --  discharge mower . We also tested whether the machines would mow in reverse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the controls , see our chart ) , others wo n't . We think most people want this feature . We did n't test the machines at mulching or bagging grass . It was a basic test : nine machines , four editors , and lots of clippings . Have a look at what we found . We hope it helps you decide how to spend your hard-earned money . John Deere Deere was an old tractor company by the time some of the other brands were launched . Still , that did n't mean we were about to give the green machine a free ride-it 's an expensive product , and when people ask that kind of money for their equipment , it had better perform . It did.The Deere proved very easy to use . Its hydrostatic transmission is operated with separate forward and reverse foot pedals on the right side of the tractor , it has a cruise control lever on the right rear fender , and its deck is controlled by an electrically operated clutch . Pull on the knob to engage the clutch and the cutting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decks cutting height is dial adjusted . Any flaws ? Not as far as we were concerned . We would recommend avoiding steep slopes or using wheel weights if that 's not possible.The Deere 's Photograph JOHN DEERE LX277 KUBOTA T1760A-48 CUB CADET 2176 // fat rear tires are good at distributing weight but seemed to cause the machine to lose traction . Kubota We found the Kubota to be a very effective , well-mannered and well-built tractor . Its liquid-cooled engine was quiet , and one feature that we all liked is that the engine revs up automatically when the deck is engaged . Again , there were no substantial complaints with this machine , but we noticed some rattling from the deck hardware when the machine was cutting.That should not exist on a machine this expensive . Also , its engine cuts off a bit too abruptly if you forget to use the button override switch when cutting in reverse . We learned after the test that Kubota plans to discontinue this machine , though the company said that there should be sufficient inventory left if you go looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1770 , and it will be equipped with an air-cooled Kawasaki engine and a 44-in. deck . Its list price , at press time , was about $4000 . Cub Cadet Solid . If we had to choose one word to describe the Cub , that word would serve nicely.This tractor produced a crisp cut , climbed hills with less slippage than many of the other models , and it was free of annoying rattles . We think a separate throttle and choke is a more civilized way to control an engine , and the Cub engineers evidently agree . The machine 's other controls are nicely arranged as well . We also liked the fact that the Cub has an easy-to-use , slide-in mulching plug . A significant flaw in our eyes is the Cub 's inability to cut in reverse . There is no override mechanism for it . In the case of this machine , however , if you shift into reverse while mowing , all you disconnect is the deck.The engine does n't stall . Ariens Of all the tractors we tested , the Ariens was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ price range . Note , we 're saying performance here , not durability.The more expensive tractors come with heavier components . Still , the Ariens was a study in efficiency . Its engineers understood where to spend their money to produce a solid , 42-in. - wide mowing machine that 's easy to use and produces a crisp cut . As an aside , the Ariens was the only machine to have nongraduated cut-height settings .

Finally , it earned a few extra points with us because it mows in reverse . Shift into reverse and keep cutting , no falderal required . Simplicity If you want a tractor to cut closely around obstacles , this is your machine.The diameter of its uncut circle ( the circle of grass left uncut when the mower is put into a hard left turn ) is far smaller than any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in reverse with a simple move of the shift lever . Other wise , it proved to be a machine that was easy to operate and one that produced a good cut , even over rough ground , which was surprising to us given that it is designed primarily to mulch.To convert the machine , you have to remove its mulch plug and install its side  --  discharge deflector . Unfortunately , the deflector fits the deck a bit too precisely , which makes the deflector 's installation quite difficult . Secondly , the deck is equipped with a threaded adjustment bar that allows a homeowner to fine-tune the cutting height beyond what the height  --  adjustment lever makes available . Our testers were divided on whether that was necessary . Toro The Toro is a machine designed for simple operation and long life . It 's a midpriced tractor with some heavy-duty features , like substantial C-shaped frame rails and a battery with removable cell caps . It was our only tractor equipped with a deck  --  cleaning port-a fitting to which you connect a garden hose to wash accumulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we prefer separate choke and throttle levers , we admit that one lever is simpler , and that 's why many people prefer it . The Toro 's hydrostatic transmission Photograph The Snapper tractor was among those that used a hand lever to control the hydrostatic transmission . The battery was accessible and secure on the John Deere . It is located under the hood and held with a flexible strap . A well-designed , lift-off screen protects the Kubota 's top-mounted radiator from grass clippings , dust and debris . Husqvarna uses a dial to adjust the deck 's cutting height . A gauge to the dial 's left indicates the height setting . // is operated with one pedal . Push it forward to go forward , rock your foot back to go in reverse-we found the pedal to be a bit too sensitive . We noticed that the Toro chugged its way through deep grass and did n't get stuck as easily as other machines on wet slopes . It was one of three machines that use a lever-actuated pulley to engage the PTO . Snapper The Snapper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we requested a 17-hp , but ended up having to test the 16-hp machine sent rather than try to get the larger engine ) . No matter.The Snapper had sufficient power . It 's a comfortable machine with lots of legroom , precise steering and well-placed controls . There is one exception to that-it has a clunky parking brake mechanism , a poorly located hand lever that sets and releases the brake . It 's worth noting that , like the Husqvarna and Craftsman , this machine uses a lever-operated transmission.The testers were split on this feature . Some preferred the simplicity of a lever-operated transmission , while others preferred foot  --  operated machines.They reasoned that there are times when you want to adjust ground speed while using one hand to steer and another to operate a control , such as the PTO . Husqvarna The Husqvarna is essentially identical to the Craftsman , but for the extra $250 , you get a lot of nice stuff thrown in : a third blade on the deck , a wider deck , a bigger gas tank , an electric PTO , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ axle and dial-adjusted cutting height . So if you 've got just a little extra money to spend , it 's well worth investigating this machine . Otherwise , it was Photograph The Craftsman tractor is among several machines that use a combined choke and throttle lever .

Also , if you 're like us , you want a tractor to cut in reverse without any fooling around.This machine did that . Craftsman There is no way to describe the Craftsman as anything other than basic . Aside from the hydrostatic transmission , it 's a look back at where these tractors were years ago . And if you want to go that route as completely as possible , the machine is also available in a gear  --  transmission version . But we did like its 42-in. deck , which is configured in such a way that you can mow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's right side . Like the Husqvarna , it has excellent oil filter access , and it is among the few tractors here that offer a repair parts section in its manual . Also , a sticker inside the hood lists common replacement part numbers . Conclusion We 've never tested a product category in which price was so clearly an indicator of product performance and ease of use ( there was one exception to this , and we 'll get to that in a moment ) . Part of this is in the engine itself.There 's no question that tractors with more expensive twin  --  cylinder engines are nicer to operate and are almost certainly more durable than their single-cylinder counterparts . Also , more money buys heavier components with better vibration-dampening characteristics . On to the rankings . Photograph Press the large foot pedal to make the John Deere drive forward .

Filling up the Simplicity is easy . Its gas tank is well positioned under the hood , and it has a large , well-shaped cap . The Snapper is among the machines with an easily accessible , twist-off oil filter located on the side of the engine . // Deere ranks first , just edging out the Kubota . Both machines are quiet , powerful , comfortable and built to provide many years of reliable service . We think the Deere is a better buy for residential cutting , but we are forced to acknowledge that the Kubota would edge out the Deere in terms of durability for large-scale cutting . In fact , we learned that the Kubota really fell outside the test parameters that we had established . It 's essentially a commercial machine ( except for its deck size ) with a durable and quiet water-cooled engine.The clear third-place winner is the Cuba solid and well-engineered machine that ranked well below @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our test with a vertically oriented engine and a steel driveshaft to connect the transmission and engine . Our only significant complaint with the machine is that it does n't cut in reverse . That brings us to the biggest surprise in the test . Ariens is on the high end of the midpriced scale but it proved to be an extremely effective , easy-to-use mower.We do n't have an official " best buy " category , but the Ariens would fit that bill . Things get a bit sticky in the rankings here . We have it as Toro ( because of its rugged construction ) , then Simplicity and Snapper . But the performance and features are almost too close to call with these three . Simplicity has the tightest turning diameter of any of the nine tractors tested , so if this is important to you , then that may be the tiebreaker . That leaves Husqvarna and Sears . Even though they rank last and next to last , that does n't tell the whole story . We think that the extra cash for the Husqvarna is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substantial leg up compared to the Sears . But if you are absolutely strapped for cash , and need a basic mower , the Sears is fine .
