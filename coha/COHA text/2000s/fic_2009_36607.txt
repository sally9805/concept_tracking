THE BRINK : 1947 <p> * * * <p> Can the subaltern speak ? - GAYATRI CHAKRAVORTY SPIVAK <p> * * * <p> Might they not be the cracks and chinks through which another voice , other voices , speak in our lives ? By what right do we close our ears to them ? -J . M. COETZEE , FOE <p> THE SEA INSIDE <p> * * * <p> The girl moved like water itself , unthinkingly toward the darkening horizon . She was only sixteen , or maybe seventeen . A brilliant red sari clung to her body . Tangled hair lashed at her face . <p> Now , as the thickening dusk closed in upon her , the girl stood on the outskirts of the village , little more than a cluster of thatched huts huddled at the water 's edge . A solitary coconut tree rose to the sky , straining against the heavy winds . Somewhere a dog barked incessantly . She took a step back , waiting for the moon to slip behind scattered clouds . The mirrorwork on her sari cast pale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to touch them with her left foot , the dancing lights illuminating her toes , the middle one adorned with a silver ring , the stub of a sixth gracelessly curled under . She pressed onward , fighting a feeling that she was being repelled by some invisible energy , a collective fear . <p> Her destination was not the village itself but a solitary hut on its outskirts . Unlike the others , this one was badly weathered , its coconut-frond roof rotted , its interior pitch black . The wind stung , as if in warning , pulling her back , back . She did not stop until she reached the decayed bamboo mat tied to the doorway , dimly remembering weaving it as a young child . Here it was , proof that she had once inhabited this place at the world 's rim , before she had begun to bleed , before the women had gathered , their salty voices crooning the ancient tale of the menstruating girl who caused the waves to turn blood-red and sea snakes to infest the waters . She should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mat away and stepped in . <p> The first thing she saw was the glint of the moonlight on bangles . A figure squatted in the corner of the hut , rocking back and forth on her haunches . <p> " You 've come back , " a voice said . <p> The girl nodded , wanting nothing more than to weep . But this was not a time to be weak . She wanted something from this woman , this blind midwife who had powers , unspoken powers . " Help me . " <p> The tinkling bangles fell silent . <p> " You must , " the girl pleaded , eyes shining with loss , " you were the one who cursed me ! " <p> The midwife cackled . <p> The girl dropped her face , remembering the taunts , the bits and pieces she gleaned from the other children when they dared speak about her ill-fated birth . <p> It had been Nariyal Poornima , the day that the fishermen returned to sea after the long rainy months during which no fishing was done . Monsoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the men had stayed away while the ocean 's bounty was reproducing under the turbulent waters . Women , too , emerged that early morning , walking in the opposite direction , toward the shrine , to offer prayers to Ekuira , deity of the seas , patron of the Koli fisherpeople . <p> " Your Ma walked slowly , " the midwife offered in a glutinous voice , " her belly pushing out so far that we thought there were two inside . She went to pray . " <p> The girl knew of the small shamiana that rose from the treacherous rocks , its thick cloth canopy decorated in colorful patchwork . She was never allowed to go near but once visited it in secret , a single velvety marigold clutched in her small fingers to offer at the small stone shrine devoted to Ekuira , the orange-faced goddess with eight-arms , born from the body of Lord Brahma , Creator of the Universe . O most compassionate Goddess , she had recited a prayer of fisherwomen for their husbands , your oceans are so vast , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked a coconut at the goddess 's feet . " <p> The girl braced herself , knowing what came next , that her mother 's birth-water had broken open , defiling the shrine . The other fisherwomen had dragged her away , spitting accusations . When her father 's boat failed to return that evening , no one had been surprised . <p> The midwife cackled once more , then as if suddenly tired of the old story , she pulled out a small , rusted lantern and lit it . Her face-dried and weathered as salted shrimp-cast eerie silhouettes upon the wall . " You 've been banished again , " she stated . <p> Had I been there just this morning ? the girl wondered , remembering the warmth of the body next to her , the scarlet-tinged light filtering through the colored glasswork of the wall . " I must go back , " she whispered , unable to keep the desperation from her voice . <p> " Once you 've been banished , you can never go back , not in life , not in death , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the girl 's face . " They will have done a purification ceremony , just as we did the day you left , to block your spirit from entering . That 's why you ca n't go beyond my hut into our fishing village . That 's why you can never return there . " <p> " There must be some way , " the girl implored , her eyes wild . It had been home , that bungalow . She was only a servant there , true , but for a little while , she had been much more . She pulled out the merciful stash of money that Maji , the bungalow 's matriarch , had given her and placed it in the midwife 's gnarled hands . <p> The old woman seized the cash and bit into the wad with broken , blackened teeth . A line of saliva dripped down her chin . " There is one way , " she said slowly , her tobacco-stained mouth curling into a smile , " but it involves an exceptional sacrifice . You must be strong , unwavering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gritted her teeth as if to underscore her determination . She was nothing , nothing if she could not be there . <p> " I was right to banish you . Someone else has died . " <p> " An accident , a baby- " <p> " I thought you had learned the ways of birthing , " the old woman sneered , " always lurking nearby so others could n't see you . " <p> " I delivered the baby safely , there was n't time for the lady to go to the nursing home . It came too fast . Maji ordered the boiling water and sheets . I told her that I knew the way so she let me deliver it while the others waited outside . I did it exactly as I had seen ... and then- " Her voice broke . <p> " You were away when the baby drowned . " <p> The girl nodded . <p> " Just like with your father . An accident perhaps . Perhaps not . There will be other deaths , other fatal accidents . " <p> " Other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue lolling to one side . " You defiled the Goddess , your birth-water and blood raining down upon her altar . You were exiled when you began to bleed . You are dangerous-unknowingly , unconsciously-during your six days of bleeding . You draw dark powers from impure blood , blood of any kind from that region-birth blood , menstrual blood , virgin blood . " <p> The girl felt the stickiness between her legs , she had begun her cycle that very morning , an alarmingly heavy one . <p> The old woman began to mutter , " Exiled at thirteen , thirteen-year exile . " She lifted a mat on the earthen floor and stuck her arm down into a hole . One by one , she pulled out tiny packets wrapped in old newspaper and lay them in front of her . From somewhere inside her ragged sari , she pulled out a small coconut : raw , smooth , green . <p> " Why go back ? " she asked . " What do you desire there ? " <p> The girl looked away , remembering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , skin so fragrant she had only to be in the same room to be intoxicated by it . A forbidden touch in a scarlet-tinged room . <p> The midwife crowed horrifically as if she had read her mind , and then , regaining her composure , opened the newspaper packets . In each lay a powder , some velvety yellow , others a gritty brown , blue , black . She began mixing them together , all the while chanting in low tones . The dog 's barking drew closer and with it came the snapping of footfalls upon dried palm fronds . The girl glanced over her shoulder , regretting that she had not pulled the mat back over the doorway . Moving quickly now , the old woman cracked the coconut open with a sickle-shaped koyta and poured in the powder mixture , stirring it into the coconut milk . The concoction smoked , filling the air with a foul , polluted smell . <p> The girl drew back , horrified . <p> " Exiled at thirteen , thirteen-year exile , " the midwife muttered again . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For thirteen years you can not go back . " <p> " No ! " <p> " The fulfillment of your desires carries a price , an unfathomable price . " <p> " I 've lost too much already , " the girl whispered as the smoke coiled around her . " I wo n't lose this . " <p> " Think of that then , " the midwife commanded , holding the reddish , snaking liquid to the girl 's lips . " You must think of that as you drink . What you desire will become your truth . " <p> The girl hesitated , touching the mole upon her cheek for luck . <p> " Fast now , fast , someone is near ! " <p> And the girl once again remembered the feel of warm skin , the sweet breath of laughter . And the loss was so deep , so intense that she felt a deep hatred boil up inside her chest for those who had cast her out that morning , severing her from the only place she regarded as home . <p> As the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire was not love . <p> But revenge . <p> Chapter Two BEGINNINGS : Thirteen Years Later * * * <p> We have to build the noble mansion of free India where all her children may dwell . - Jawaharlal Nehru <p> Speech On the Granting of Indian Independence August 14 , 1947 <p> * * * <p> Hich : A person who is nowhere , a thing which has no place , no identity or personality of its own , from ' hichgah ' - nowhere. - From the Old Pahlavi Persian Zia Jaffrey , The Invisibles <p> THE BUNGALOW <p> * * * <p> Pinky Mittal 's earliest memory was of glistening water . It splashed and crashed along with the sounds of wheels straining to push forward , the crack of a switch upon a bullock 's bleeding back , shouts of men , whimperings of hungry children . There was a buzzing , a screeching , like the sound of a kettle of vultures , their formation like blackened bubbles rising from the river . <p> In this memory , so primal that it came to her only as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , golden yellow like the champa flower . The woman looked to the barren sky as if beseeching the gods , and then-slowly , very slowly-began to fall into the current . She was carried swiftly downward , the sari palloo trailing behind her like the fluttering of a dying bird . Pinky cried out , the sound coming out as a baby 's inconsolable wail , but the golden woman sank without a sound . <p> And then came comprehension . <p> It was her mother . <p> Pinky woke with a start in the strangely stifling room . Sweat poured from her skin and pooled in every crevice of her body , between her fingers , behind her knees , into her eyes . She opened them , feeling the sting of salt , the blurriness of tears , and instinctively reached up , grasping for something solid in her dream-induced haze , and knocked over a covered steel cup by her bed . It clattered to its side , spilling water across the polished wood floor . <p> She lifted herself up on to her elbows , taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the familiarity of the room to offer comfort . From her vantage point , upon a mattress positioned at the side of her grandmother 's bed , Pinky could make out the hulking outline of the cabinets lining one wall , each painted with fanciful , ocher-colored chinoiserie murals . As a child , she had spent hours tracing the long , tapering branches which occasionally meandered from one panel to the next . She had woven endless , circular stories about the exotic birds who inhabited the trees : the cruel , sharp-beaked crimson one with the white-tipped feathers , the quiet russet one who pecked amongst the thatches of long grass , the little baby one who chirped longingly from her tiny nest . On one rectangular panel , the painted branches ended in a cluster of vermilion-colored berries that Pinky had long ago ordained with magical powers . <p> She drew out each story , peppering it with obstacles and twists , as if to delay the final moment , to savor the thrill when the sole , gossamer-winged butterfly on the panel swooped down and saved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spanning the breadth of the six murals , she distributed the berries in a queenly way . And by magic , the one-legged bird grew another leg and the blue bird with faded feathers received shiny new ones . Pinky always saved the final berry for the sad , little baby bird who had lost its family . Eat it , she whispered to the baby bird , it will bring them back . <p> Rubbing her eyes , she stretched as if to push the last sticky dream remnants away and then opened a small teak chest inlaid with intricate enamel work on the floor next to her . It contained her most precious possessions : fresh pencils that had arrived by ship , a box of sticky oil pastels , a tin of enameled jacks sent as a gift from a relative in Haridwar , a swatch of emerald silk , and a faded magazine photo . In lieu of actual photos of her dead mother , of which none remained , Pinky had torn out a picture of the actress Madhubala from an old copy of Filmindia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if lost in thought , her face and hair framed by an ethereal glow . She is stunning , her lips parted slightly , a pearl choker at her neck . Over time , Pinky had forgotten that the photo was not really her mother . She knew very little about her , except for a few stories about her childhood and the fact that she drowned while crossing a river . <p> Pinky carefully returned the photo to the chest , pushing it against the wall next to a heavy dresser with a small brass mirror overturned on top . Just above her on the imposing Edwardian-style bed , her grandmother 's enormous belly rose from a faded sheet like a snowcapped peak , her snores already at deafening levels . A mosquito coil burned in one corner , releasing a bittersweet smell , where a temperamental air-conditioning unit jutted out from the wall . Pinky clicked the knob and the machine sputtered to high , offering a blast of cooling air . It was early June , the hottest , most unbearable , most humid stretch of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She sat on the bed , pulling her grandmother 's warm hands , knotted and thick with bluish veins , into her own . They were life-giving hands , ones that had held her , clothed her , and fed her ever since she had been a motherless infant thirteen years ago . When Pinky was younger and still sleeping in the huge Edwardian bed , she used to hold on to one of Maji 's hands through the night and perform a little ritual whenever she was afraid or sick . Turning it face up , Pinky ran her finger along the lines in the palm , starting with the thickest one that curved around the thumb . She meticulously touched a line for each of her years , as if to somehow map herself into the infinite universe within Maji 's hand . She incanted a small prayer : I am in you . Even at thirteen , Pinky still continued with this small assertion of belonging . <p> After she had finished , she wiped up the spilled water and retrieved the steel cup . Peering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teak door on the front verandah and across the entire length of the bungalow , she could barely make out a dim glow from a large window overlooking the back garden . A parallel hallway ran down the other , west side of the bungalow , dividing it into roughly three sections with bedrooms , bathrooms , and the kitchen in either wing , and the front parlor , the dining hall , and living room in the center . The one-story bungalow had been built over a hundred years earlier by a high-ranking East India Company officer as an architectural symbol of the British Raj . His wife , longing for the tidy coolness of Home , however , had irritably christened the bungalow The Jungle . Pinky loved its elegant symmetry and grand teak doors , its Moghul-inspired archways , and the lush , tropical garden in back with its grove of mango trees . <p> During the season , the trees dripped with the fleshy , golden fruit and Maji gave away all they did not need , sending baskets to friends and relatives throughout Bombay . Mango-picking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday unto themselves . The gardener arrived at the crack of dawn with extra workers and they collected huge basketfuls of the fruit , while Pinky and her cousins sat under the trees , biting into the sweet flavor , their faces smeared bright orange . They are Lord Ganesh 's favorite , too , Maji always told them as she clipped a handful of auspicious mango leaves to hang on the front verandah . Later in the day , she supervised the distribution of the mangos in the ornate dining hall while her daughter-in-law , Savita , sauntered around the long , polished dining table , squeezing and prodding the fruit to ensure that the best ones were earmarked for her relations . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
