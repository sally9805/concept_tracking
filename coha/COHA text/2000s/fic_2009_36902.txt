" Sin is crouching at your door , it desires to have you , but you shall master it . " <p>  --  The Lord to Cain , Genesis 4:7 <p> <p> The Devil is in the details . <p> Evangeline Hollis understood the true gist of that saying now , surrounded as she was by thousands of Satan 's minions . Some wore Seattle Seahawks baseball caps , others wore San Diego Chargers jerseys . All bore detailed designs similar to tribal tattoos on their skin that betrayed both what species of cursed being they were and what their rank in Hell 's hierarchy was . To her enhanced eyes , it looked like a damn festival for sinners . They were drinking beer , devouring nachos , and waving giant foam fingers . <p> In reality , the event was a football game in Qualcomm Stadium . The day was classic Southern California perfection -- sunny and warm , the eighty-degree temperature balanced by a delightfully cool breeze . Mortals mingled with Infernal beings in blissful ignorance , simply enjoying a bit of afternoon spectator sport . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves sunning themselves alongside lambs . Gore , violence , and death were the inevitable result of any interaction between the two . <p> " Stop thinking about them . " <p> Alec Cain 's deep , sensual voice made her shiver inside , but outwardly she shot him a rueful glance over the top of her sunglasses . He was always telling her to ignore their prey when they were n't on the hunt . As if rogue fae , demons , mages , werewolves , dragons , and thousands of variants of the same were easily disregarded . <p> " There 's a woman breastfeeding her child next to an incubus , " she muttered . <p> " Angel . " His nickname for her moved over her skin like a tangible caress . Alec 's voice could turn driving directions into foreplay . " We 're taking the day off , remember ? " <p> She blew out her breath and looked away . At a few inches over six feet , Alec was blessed with a powerful chest and tautly ridged abdomen that were noticeable even through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legs presently showcased in knee-length Dickies shorts and biceps so beautifully defined they were coveted by both men and women . <p> He was her lover ... occasionally . Like all sweets , Alec was delicious and satisfying , but too much of him caused a sugar crash that left her dazed and reeling . He 'd also ruined life as she had known it . Her career aspiration had been interior design , not Infernal bounty hunting . <p> " If only it was that simple , " Eve groused . " How can I go on vacation when I 'm surrounded by work ? Besides , they stink even when I 'm ignoring them . " <p> " All I smell is you , " he purred , leaning over to nuzzle his nose against her cheek . " Yum . " <p> " It creeps me out that they 're everywhere . I went to McDonald 's yesterday and the person serving me at the window was a faery . I could n't even eat my Big Mac . " <p> " Betcha ate the fries . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somber eyes . " There 's a difference between staying on your toes and paranoia . " <p> " I 'm cautious , not a basket case . Until I find a way out of this mark business , I 'm making the best of it . " <p> " I 'm proud of you . " <p> Eve sighed . Having Alec for a mentor was such a bad idea , and not just because it was the equivalent of a Hollywood casting couch in most Marks ' eyes . Never mind that the true " casting couch " was the exchange of sexual favors in return for a position you wanted . No one ever wanted the Mark of Cain . <p> The Marks ' hierarchy started at the bottom with the newbies and topped off with Alec , the original and most badass Mark of them all . There was no way to surpass him . There was also no way to work with him . He was the quintessential loner , the very definition of the word . Yet here was Eve , a six-week newbie in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't trust anyone else to watch her back . She was important to him . <p> The other Marks thought working with God 's primary enforcer had to be a vacation . While it was true that Infernals did n't mess with Alec unless they had a death wish , it did n't make things any easier . Demons now targeted her as a way to get to him . To make things worse , Alec had been marked so long that he 'd forgotten what it was like to be new and confused . There were things he expected her to simply " know , " and he became frustrated when he realized she did n't . <p> He squeezed her hand . " What happened to the girl who just wanted to forget about everything for a couple of hours ? " <p> " That was before she was kidnapped and nearly blown to smithereens . " Eve stood . " I 'll be back . I need to use the little girls ' room . " <p> As she stood , Alec caught her wrist . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He kissed the back of her hand . " When I tell you to stop thinking about them , it 's not because I want you to live in a fantasy world . I just want you to see the good stuff around you . You saw a mother nursing her baby , but you did n't see the miracle of it . You were too busy looking at the demon next to her . Do n't give them the power to ruin your day . " <p> Frowning , Eve absorbed his words , then nodded her acceptance . Alec had lived with the mark since the dawn of time and could still see miracles ; she could try . <p> " I 'll be right back , " she said . <p> He released her . After inching her way past the other spectators in their aisle , Eve sprinted up the wide cement steps . She still marveled over the speed , strength , and agility that came with the mark burned into her upper arm . She 'd always been athletic , but now she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could jump really damn high . She could also see in the dark and bust through dead-bolted doors , talents she 'd never anticipated needing or appreciating . <p> Eve reached the concourse and followed the signs to the nearest restroom . The line protruded just outside the entrance . Luckily , she was n't desperate . More than anything , she 'd just needed to get out of her seat . <p> So she waited patiently , rocking in her flip-flops with her hands in her pockets . An occasional breeze passed by , ruffling through her ponytail . It carried the mingled scent of evil and rotting souls , a pungent stench that made her stomach roil . It fell somewhere between decomposition and fresh shit , and it amazed her that the Unmarked could n't smell it . <p> How had she lived twenty-eight years of her life in complete ignorance ? How had Alec lived centuries in complete awareness ? <p> " Mom ! " The young boy in front of her was holding his crotch , crossing his legs , and wiggling madly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as if she could be the child 's sister , Eve was n't unduly surprised . Many women in Southern California did n't age . They just became plasticized caricatures of their youthful selves . This one was bleached blonde with a perfect tan , breasts a size too large for her slender frame , and plumped , glossy lips . <p> The mother looked around . <p> " Let me go in the boys ' bathroom , " he begged . <p> " I ca n't go in there with you . " <p> " I 'll be done in a minute ! " <p> Eve guessed the boy was around six years old . Old enough to pee by himself , but she understood the mother 's concern . A child had been killed in a public restroom in nearby Oceanside while his aunt waited outside . The demon who orchestrated that horror had used the oldest trick in the book -- pretending to be God . <p> The harried mother hesitated for a long moment , then gave a jerky nod . " Hurry . You can wash your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The boy ran past the drinking fountains and ducked into the men 's room . Eve offered a commiserating smile to his mom . The line moved incrementally forward . Two teenagers joined in behind her . They were dressed in the predominant fashion of layered tank tops paired with low-rise jeans . Expensive perfume saturated the air around them , which created a welcome relief from the odor of decay . In the stadium , the crowd roared . One of the Chargers ' outside linebackers was a werewolf . From the high-frequency praise of the Infernals in the crowd , he 'd done something worth cheering about . <p> " Why is the line so long ? " the girl behind her asked . <p> Eve shrugged , but the woman in front of her replied , " The bathrooms down there --  " she pointed to the left with a French manicured nail "  - -  are closed for repairs . " <p> As if on cue , the mark seared into Eve 's deltoid began to tingle , then burn . She sighed and abandoned her place . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go that bad . " <p> " Thanks , " the teenager replied . <p> Eve headed to the left , muttering to herself , " Some vacation . " <p> " You were bored anyway , babe , " purred a familiar voice . <p> Glancing to the side , Eve watched as Reed Abel fell into step with her , his mouth curved in a devilish smile that belied the wings and halo he occasionally sported for shock value . He was a mal'akh , but there was n't much angelic about Alec 's brother . <p> " That does n't mean I wanted to be put to work . " Reed was the handler in charge of her assignments , which was just a nasty trick in her opinion . Why God allowed and encouraged dissension between the two brothers was beyond her comprehension . <p> " We could blow this taco stand , " he suggested . " Go have some hot , sweaty fun . " <p> She was n't touching that invitation with a ten-foot pole . Like his brother , Reed scorched a girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kidding about the assignment ? Do you need me for something more substantial or what ? " <p> " You thought it was substantial enough before . " He winked mischievously . <p> Eve smacked him . " Do n't be crude . I refuse to be the latest toy you and your brother fight over . Go find something else to play with . " <p> " I 'm not playing with you . " <p> There was something sincere in his tone . She ignored it by necessity , although less circumspect parts of her perked up . <p> " The bathroom ? " she asked instead , when the yellow Out of Service sign came into view . <p> " Yeah . " He caught her arm and tugged her closer . " Raguel suggested it was time for an extension of your classroom training . I 'll go get Cain . " <p> Raguel was the archangel whose jurisdiction she fell under . He was the bail bondsman , Reed was the dispatcher , and she was the bounty hunter . It was a well-oiled system for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very beginning . <p> She sniffed the air . The acrid stench of Infernal wrinkled her nose . " You know ... this is like sending a medical student into brain surgery the day she first reads about it . " <p> " You do n't know your own strengths , babe . " <p> She glared . " I know when I 'm getting my ass kicked . " <p> " You 're batting a thousand so far . This one 's a wolf and you 're good with them . But be careful anyway . " <p> " Easy for you to say . You 're not the one risking your hide . " <p> His lips pressed to her temple in a quick , hard kiss . " Risking yours is enough , trust me . " <p> Skirting the Out-of-Order sign , Eve entered the men 's restroom , lamenting the fact that she was wearing her favorite flirty sandals . Due to the rigors of her " job , " she 'd taken to wearing combat boots whenever she left home , but Alec had coaxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better . <p> The harsh ammonia smell of stale urine assaulted her nostrils . Finding her target was easy . He stood in the center of the room , alone . A teenage werewolf who was eerily familiar . <p> " Remember me ? " he asked , smiling . <p> The boy was tall and thin , his face long and unremarkable . He wore a dirty gray hooded sweatshirt and jeans so low his ass was hanging out . A dark spot moved across his cheek and came to rest on his left cheekbone . His detail -- swirls around a diamond shape . Like the mark on her arm , it served a similar purpose to military insignia . <p> Recognition hit her hard , followed by an immediate chill down her spine . " Should n't you be in Northern California with your pack ? " <p> " The Alpha sent me down here to even the score . He thinks Cain needs to learn what it 's like to lose someone he loves . " <p> " There was no way to save the Alpha 's son , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose his hunts . He follows orders . " <p> " He made a deal . For you . And he broke his promise . " <p> Eve frowned . Alec had never mentioned a deal to her . But that was something she would explore later . There was a more immediate question . " You think you can take me by yourself ? " <p> His smirk turned into a grin . " I brought a friend . " <p> " Great . " That was never good . <p> The large handicapped stall in the back slammed open and something absolutely horrific thundered out . Holy shit . An Infernal that large should have reeked for yards . Instead , the only thing Eve smelled was wolf . <p> The dragon had n't fully shifted . He still wore his pants and shoes , and dark hair still covered his head . But his mouth was a protruding muzzle of razor-sharp teeth , his eyes were those of a lizard , and all of his visible flesh was covered in gorgeous multihued scales . <p> " You smell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Marks smelled sickly sweet to Infernals , which made her laugh inwardly . There was no such thing as a sweet Mark . They were all bitter . " You do n't smell like anything . " <p> We failed , she realized with a sinking feeling in her gut . Infernals still had the means to hide themselves in crowds . <p> " Brilliant , is n't it ? " the wolf asked . " Obviously , you did n't wipe out our operation completely . " <p> The dragon roared and it was a fearsome , deafening sound that echoed in the confined space of the bathroom . The mortals could n't hear it , though , and Eve 's eardrums were invincible despite their celestial sensitivity . Another boon granted by the mark . The dragon shoved the wolf aside and stomped closer . <p> " Guess that 's my cue to leave , " the kid said . " I 'll give the Alpha your regards . " <p> Eve 's gaze remained riveted on her opponent . " Yeah , tell him he screwed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ departed . Eve wanted to do the same . <p> For all her bravado , she was out of her league . If she had been capable of physical reactions to stress , her heart would be hammering and she 'd be short of breath . No doubt about it , she was going to be suffering when this confrontation was over , if she was still alive . A religious person might pray for Alec to get here soon , but that was n't an option for Eve . The Almighty did exactly what he wanted and nothing more . The purpose of prayer was to make the supplicant feel like he was doing something . It made Eve feel like she was wasting her breath . <p> " Where 's Cain ? " the dragon growled , approaching her with his hulking , lumbering stride . " I smell his stench on you . " <p> " He 's watching the game , which is what you should be doing . " Eve could n't risk telling him that Alec was coming . He might just kill her quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ odor to betray him , he could slip right past Alec . But if the dragon thought he had time , he might toy with her . Infernals liked to play . <p> " I need a snack . " His voice was so guttural she could hardly understand him . " You 'll do . " <p> " Have you tried the nachos ? " she suggested , her hands fisting . Deep inside her , power coiled . Hunger and aggression , too . It was base and animalistic , not at all the elegant sort of violence she might have expected God to employ in the destruction of his enemies . The surge was brutal ... and addicting . " The chips are kind of stale and the cheese is from a can , but it 's a lot less dangerous to your health . " <p> He snorted , which shot a burst of fire out of his muzzle . " I 've heard about you . You 're no threat to me . " <p> " Really ? " She tilted her head , frowning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies to their advantage . Eve did , too . " When 's the last time you got an update on me ? Does Hell have a newsletter ? A chat room ? Otherwise , you 're probably behind the times . " <p> " You 're cocky . And stupid . You think that sting in Upland made you a hero ? Hell 's branches are like the Hydra , bitch . Cut off one head , we grow back two . " <p> An icy lump settled in Eve 's gut . " More to sever , " she managed , albeit with a slight tremor . <p> The dragon held up his hands . As thick , sharp claws grew out of the tips of his fingers , he leered and drool ran from his gaping maw . " You 're a baby . Should make you juicy and tender . " <p> " A baby ? " she scoffed , fighting the urge to step back . " Do you have any idea what I 've been through these last six weeks ? I have some serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raised her fists , and took a deep breath . This was going to hurt . " Ready to see for yourself ? " <p> The dragon 's chest expanded on an inhale and he altered , his body assuming its natural reptilian appearance . He loomed above her , his head bent on a long graceful neck to accommodate the ceiling . He was a beautiful creature , with iridescent scales and lithe lines . Problem was , that stunning hide was like cement . Any attempt to kick or hit it would only lead to pain . For her , not him . <p> Their hide has very little vulnerability , Raguel had taught in Dragon 101 . Points of weakness are the webbing between their toes , the joint connecting the forelimbs to the torso , their eyes , and their rectum . The first will not cause mortal wounds , the second and third require proximity that can get you killed , and the fourth ... well , as the kids say , you do not want to go there . <p> <p> Holding out her hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hovering in midair , ablaze but for the hilt . Fire . Fire in Hell , fire in Heaven , fire blasting from the dragon 's nostrils forcing her to leap backward to avoid being singed . <p> Pyromaniacs , the lot of ' em . <p> If she had a choice , she 'd prefer her revolver . But she could n't carry all the time and the Almighty preferred the flame-covered sword . Never let it be said that God did n't have a flair for the dramatic . He knew his strengths , and a bit of flashy intimidation was one of them . <p> The dragon laughed or chortled or choked ... whatever . He was n't impressed . The sound of his amusement gave Eve the willies and she rolled her wrist , using the substantial weight of the blade to limber up . She 'd started out being the sorriest swordsman in her class . Now she was passably proficient , getting better every day . <p> " You missed me , " she taunted grimly , wincing when her flip-flops clung to the sticky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many things she 'd learned since getting saddled with this job was that presenting a formidable appearance went a long way toward hiding her deficiencies . Her enemies could smell her fear and they thrived on it . Throwing them for a loop with a little cockiness was sometimes the only way to gain any sort of advantage . <p> The dragon took a step toward her , his talons gouging into the tile , his weight vibrating the ground beneath them . The barrage of flames had made the room hot , but she did n't sweat . She could n't ; her body was a temple now . <p> Swinging at her with one short forelimb , the beast roared with terrible intent . He countered her evasive leap with a lash of his tail , which boasted a hard weighty scale on the tip that was used like a mace . It sank deep into the spot she 'd occupied before she stumbled out of the way with a yelp . He yanked the appendage free in a shower of ceramic dust . <p> As she ran past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sinks out of the wall . Eve darted around his side and managed to dislodge one of his scales with a hurried thrust of her blade . <p> He 'd demolished the bathroom , she gave him a paper cut . <p> " Stupid cunt ! " the beast bellowed , seemingly oblivious to the water spraying madly from the broken pipes . The depth of hatred and malevolence in the reptilian eyes added to the growing layer of hardness on her soul that was slowly changing her . Permanently . <p> Eve 's fury rose to mask her terror . Infernals such as this guy were for much more advanced Marks . If he had n't masked his scent and details , she would n't be fighting him . <p> She was in deep shit . And damn it , she was sick of being soaked all the time . Every Infernal she came across doused her with water . <p> " Reed . " Her voice was not her own . Lower and deeper , it was the language of Marks . Known as a " herald , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hurry up . I 'm in trouble . " <p> The sensation of a hot summer breeze moved over her -- Reed 's reply . <p> Lifting her free arm for balance , Eve began to feint and parry , her torso canted to the side to present a smaller target . She ducked behind her sword when another burst of flame spewed from his nostrils . The back of her hand was charred by the heat and she screamed . The damage would heal in moments , but that did n't prevent the initial agony . <p> Eve fell back , tripping over broken tiles and sobbing as a sharp piece penetrated the sole of her sandal and dug deep into her heel . Viscous warmth and the resulting slipperiness of her sole betrayed her blood loss . The dragon roared with triumph at the smell of her wounds and snapped at her with his razor-sharp teeth . <p> She was n't going to die in a men 's bathroom . No way . <p> " How the mighty have fallen , " Alec drawled . <p> Eve gasped with relief at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lashing tail , then rushed to peer around his body . <p> Alec lounged against the tiled threshold of the bathroom with both arms crossed . He looked relaxed and slightly bored , but there was a terrible darkness in his eyes when he hazarded a glance at her . She was his only weakness , a vulnerability he struggled to hide . <p> " Cain , " the dragon rumbled , his posture wary . <p> " Damon ? You used to be The Man . A courtier in the court of Asmodeus . " Alec made a chastising noise with his tongue . " Now the best you can do is terrorize rookie Marks ? " <p> " Hey , " Eve protested . " Compared to the bathroom , I 'm doing all right . " <p> The fact that her opponent had his back to her and did n't seem to think that was a danger chafed . What the hell did she have to do to get some respect ? <p> Frustration wiped out her fear and left only angry determination behind . Eve moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ height of the room , putting the weight of her body behind the downward slash of her blade . She attacked the slender fold where his tiny forelimb attached to his torso and it severed cleanly , the limb splashing onto the floor with a thud . Crimson blood spurted from the newly made hole and mixed with the water spewing from the distorted pipes . <p> The dragon howled and spun around , knocking Eve to her back . She skidded several feet in the gore-stained lake that now covered the decimated tile . He retaliated with a burst of flame . The inferno engulfed her , melting hair and skin from the top of her head down to her feet , boiling her in the flood that washed over and around her . The agony was such that she could n't voice a sound and when the flames ceased abruptly , she hoped for the relief of death . <p> But she was n't going alone . <p> Fueled by adrenaline and the animosity of a woman completely fed up with her life , Eve vaulted to her feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where she clung to the tips of his scales with one-handed desperation . The impact to her raw , burnt flesh was devastating and she cried out , nearly dropping her sword . <p> Alec was there before her , one arm banded around the dragon 's neck while the other hand gouged at the eyes . The beast flayed and screeched , whipping its neck to and fro in a vain effort to free himself of his attackers . <p> As Eve plunged the length of her blade through the vulnerable flesh created by the missing forelimb , she felt massive talons tearing into her spine . Her body arched , forcing her weapon the final inch needed to penetrate the dragon 's heart . <p> The beast howled , then exploded in a burst of white-hot embers . <p> Eve crashed to the ground , paralyzed by her wounds . She lay blinking , gasping , surrounded by the requiem created by the shower from the pipes . <p> The vibration of footsteps pounding through water assailed her , then Alec was pulling her gingerly into his lap . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tentatively touched her ruined skin . " Do n't you dare die on me . You hear me ? I just got you back , damn you --  " <p> " Alec . " She tried to open her eyes , but the effort required more energy than she possessed . Shivers wracked her abused frame and rattled her teeth . The faint chemical tang of tap water filled her nostrils , as did the scent of ashes , demon , and blood . Her blood . <p> She could finally smell and taste the sweetness of it . <p> " I 'm here . " His voice broke . " I-I 'm here . " <p> " The Alpha did this . " <p> " What ? " <p> " The Alpha . He wanted ... his son ... he tried ... " <p> " Shh . Do n't talk , angel . " A hot tear splashed onto her raw skin . Then another . " Save your strength . " <p> " We missed something in Upland , " she whispered , sinking into an encroaching blanket of darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go back ... We missed something ... " <p> Copyright 2009 by S. J.
