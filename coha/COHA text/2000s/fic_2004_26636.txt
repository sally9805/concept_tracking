Lady Whistledown Strikes Back Chapter One This week 's most coveted invitation appears to be Lady Neeley 's upcoming dinner party , to be held Tuesday evening . The guest list is not long , nor is it remarkably exclusive , but tales have spread of last year 's dinner party , or , to be more specific , of the menu , and all London ( and most especially those of greater girth ) are eager to partake . This Author was not gifted with an invitation and therefore must suffer at home with a jug of wine , a loaf of bread , and this column , but alas , do not feel pity , Dear Reader . Unlike those attending the upcoming gustatory spectacle , This Author does not have to listen to Lady Neeley ! Lady Whisteldown 's Society Papers , 27 May 1816 Tillie Howard supposed that the night could get worse , but in all truth , she could n't imagine how . She had n't wanted to attend Lady Neeley 's dinner party , but her parents had insisted , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her hostess  --  the occasionally-feared , occasionally-mocked Lady Neeley  --  had a voice rather like fingernails on slate . Tillie was also trying to ignore the rumblings of her stomach , which had expected nourishment at least an hour earlier . The invitation had said seven in the evening , and so Tillie and her parents , the Earl and Countess of Canby , had arrived promptly at half past the hour , with the expectation of being led into supper at eight . But here it was , almost nine , with no sign that Lady Neeley intended to forgo talking for eating anytime soon . But what Tillie was most trying to ignore , what she in fact would have fled the room to avoid , had she been able to figure out a way to do so without causing a scene , was the man standing next to her . " Jolly fellow , he was , " boomed Robert Dunlop , with that joviality that comes from having consumed just a hair more wine than one ought . " Always ready for a spot of fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother Harry , who had died nearly one year earlier , on the battlefield at Waterloo . When she and Mr. Dunlop had been introduced , she 'd been excited to meet him . She 'd loved Harry desperately and missed him with a fierceness that sometimes took her breath away . And she 'd thought that it would be wonderful to hear stories of his last days from one of his comrades in arms . Except Robert Dunlop was not telling her what she wanted to hear . " Talked about you all the time , " he continued , even though he 'd already said as much ten minutes earlier . " ' Cept ... " Tillie did nothing but blink , not wanting to encourage further elucidation . This could n't end well . Mr. Dunlop squinted at her . " ' Cept he always described you as all elbows and knees and with crooked braids . " Tillie gently touched her hand to her expertly coifed chignon . She could n't help it . " When Harry left for the Continent , I did have crooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knees needed no further discussion . " He loved you a great deal , " Mr. Dunlop said . His voice was surprisingly soft and thoughtful , enough to command Tillie 's full attention . Maybe she should n't be so quick to judge . Robert Dunlop meant well . He was certainly good at heart , and rather handsome , cutting quite a dashing figure in his military uniform . Harry had always written of him with affection , and even now , Tillie was having trouble thinking of him as anything other than " Robbie . " Maybe there was a little more to him . Maybe it was the wine . Maybe ... " Spoke of you glowingly . Glowingly , " Robbie repeated , presumably for extra emphasis . Tillie just nodded . She missed Harry , even if she was coming to realize that he had informed approximately one thousand men that she was a skinny gawk . Robbie nodded . " Said you were the best of females , if one could look beneath the freckles . " Tillie started scouting the exits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ torn hem , or a horrible chest cough . Robbie leaned in to look at her freckles . Or death . Her thespian demise would surely end up as the lead story in tomorrow 's Whistledown , but Tillie was just about ready to give it a go . It had to be better than this . " Told us all he despaired of you ever getting married , " Robbie said , nodding in a most friendly manner . " Always reminded us that you had a bang-up dowry . " That was it . Her brother had been using his time on the battlefield to beg men to marry her , using her dowry ( as opposed to her looks , or heaven forbid , her heart ) as the primary draw . It was just like Harry to go and die before she could kill him for this . " I need to go , " she blurted out . Robbie looked around . " Where ? " Anywhere . " Out , " Tillie said , hoping that would be explanation enough . Robbie 's brow knit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door . " Oh , " he said . " Well , I suppose ... There you are ! " Tillie turned around to see who had managed to pull Robbie 's attention off of her . A tall gentleman wearing the same uniform as Robbie was walking toward them . Except , unlike Robbie , he looked ... Dangerous . His hair was dark , honey blond , and his eyes were  --  well , she could n't possibly tell what color they were from three yards away , but it did n't really matter because the rest of him was enough to make any young lady weak in the legs . His shoulders were broad , his posture was perfect , and his face looked as if it ought to be carved in marble . " Thompson , " Robbie said . " Dashed good to see you . " Thompson , Tillie thought , mentally nodding . It must be Peter Thompson , Harry 's closest friend . Harry had mentioned him in almost every missive , but clearly he 'd never actually described him , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before her . Of course , if Harry had described him , he would have just shrugged and said something like , " Regular-looking fellow , I suppose . "
