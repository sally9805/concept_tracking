Section : A CENTURY OF FLIGHT From the Wright brothers ' breakthrough 100 years ago this month to the latest robot jets , the past century has been shaped by the men and women who got us off the ground <p> AS AN AIR FORCE TEST PILOT , Lt. Col. Dawn Dunlop has flown dozens of different airplanes , from the nimble F-I5E Strike Eagle fighter to the massive C-17 transport jet to the Russian MIG-21 . Stationed at Edwards Air Force Base , she 's part of the elite squadron that is putting the cutting-edge F/A-22 Raptor , a jet fighter , through its paces . But the aircraft that Dunlop has had the toughest time controlling was a replica of the Wright brothers ' 1902 glider . More than once she crash-landed the muslin-skinned craft onto the windswept sands of Kitty Hawk , North Carolina . " It was a real eye-opener , " Dunlop recalls of the ( bruising ) experience last year , part of a commemorative Air Force program . " They 've made it so simple to fly today we 've forgotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , much of the world will be revisiting " back then " as numerous ceremonies , books and reenactments mark the invention of powered flight . It was just after 10:30 in the morning on December 17,1903 , when Orville Wright , an Ohio inventor and bicycle shop owner , took off into a near-freezing head wind for a 12-second propeller-driven trip  --  a 120-foot voyage that may well have launched the modern age . " Aviation is the definitive technology of the 20th century , " says Tom Crouch , senior curator of aeronautics at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum ( NASM ) and author of Wings : A History of Aviation , from Kites to the Space Age . " Flight symbolized our deepest aspirations , like freedom and control of our destiny . " <p> Amid all the celebrations of the long-anticipated centennial , it might be easy to lose sight of just how amazing those landmark early flights were . As Dunlop discovered , Wright aircraft were dangerous . Frail assemblies of wire , wood and cloth powered by homemade engines , they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In fact , planes based on the Flyer that Orville Wright coaxed off the ground would kill dozens of pilots in coming years . Still , the craft embodied what We recognize today as the basics of flight , and though aviation has advanced far beyond anything the brothers might have first imagined  --  in 2000 , airplanes carried more than three billion passengers  --  the Wrights anticipated a surprising range of crucial developments . " Flying that glider was a real challenge , " Dunlop says , " but when you take yourself back , you realize what a brilliant design it really was . " <p> From the ancient Greeks , whose mythological tale of Icarus ' wax wings melting when he soared too close to the sun , to carvings left by the South American Incan civilization on the walls of its holy Andean citadel of Machu Picchu , humanity has long been fascinated by the idea of flying . Renaissance paintings and frescoes of Christ 's ascension into heaven " had a concept of air as a thing to be worked , " says Richard Hallion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and author of Taking Flight : Inventing the Aerial Age from Antiquity through the First World War . " Christ is shown lifting off like a rocket , and the Apostles all have windblown garments . Angels have muscular wings in proportion to their size . " Among the most startling early visions of powered human flight are Leonardo da Vinci 's 15th-century sketches of mechanical flapping wings and crude helicopters . Yet Leonardo 's ideas never got off the page . <p> The first person to apply scientific principles to the problems of flight was George Cayley , an English baronet known today as the father of aerial navigation . Born in 1773 , he built the first glider to go aloft with a person aboard  --  his coachman , in 1853  --  and correctly identified lift , drag and thrust as the main forces to be mastered for powered flight . Cayley , who published his research in the likes of Nicholson 's Journal of Natural Philosophy , Chemistry , and the Arts , was the first aviation experimenter to use research methods that would be familiar to today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NASM 's aeronautics division , writes in his book Visions of a Flying Machine . <p> The first hot-air balloon with passengers took to the air in 1783 , when its inventors , the Montgolfier brothers , sent a sheep , a rooster and a duck soaring for eight minutes in the sky over Versailles . For the next century , lighter-than-air balloons and airships , unwieldy or impossible to control , were considered the only realistic way to get aloft . Meanwhile , inventors kept struggling with the challenge of powered , heavier-than-air flight . Some built gliders shaped like moths or bats ; others built massive , steam-powered aircraft that were unflyable ; one such contraption collapsed under its own weight . None " had the slightest influence on the invention of the airplane , " Crouch writes . <p> Some pioneers were on the right track . The German Otto Lilienthal built 16 different gilders between 1891 and 1896 , making almost 2,000 flights in the low hills outside Berlin . In his experiments , he accumulated data on lift and would inspire the Wright brothers , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a dampening effect on aviation . Convinced that powered flight was a dangerous folly , many Europeans working on the problem aborted their efforts . <p> Unlike their predecessors , the Wrights realized that control of an aircraft was at least as important as lift and thrust . Their crucial inspiration was understanding that aircraft would fly in three dimensions : climbing and descending ( pitch ) , left and right ( yaw ) , and roll ( the banking , tilting motion that in conjunction with the rudder sends a plane into dramatic , sweeping turns ) . Roll , especially , had been largely ignored or unimagined by their predecessors . Hallion writes that the Wrights , as cyclists , visualized an airplane turning much as a bike rider makes a hard turn  --  by leaning into it . John Anderson , curator of aerodynamics at the National Air and Space Museum and author of The Airplane  --  A History of Its Technology , says the Wrights ' " longest-lasting technological contribution is purely and simply flight control . Wilbur Wright was the first person to understand how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those used to steer boats through water , and elevators ( like rudders , except horizontal ) were enough to move a plane up and down or left and right . But the third dimension , making a plane bank and turn , required a wholly new approach . The Wrights ' first breakthrough was realizing that air flowing across the wings could be used to push one wing down while it lifted the other  --  " rolling " the plane through a banked , leaning turn . Their next was figuring out how to get both wings to move the right way at the right time  --  a beautifully simple concept called wing-warping , which involved twisting the entire wing to facilitate turning . <p> The Wrights ' combination of creativity and engineering skill continues to amaze scholars today " They had the ability to visualize machines that had n't been built yet , " Crouch says . From the time they hit upon wing-warping as the solution for moving an aircraft in three dimensions in the spring of 1899 , it was only four and a half years until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hawk . As Hallion puts it , " The Wrights , when they got their act together , moved with incredible speed . " <p> AT FIRST , the airplane 's potential beggared the imaginations of the most progressive scientists . Too expensive for anyone but rich daredevils and too dangerous for regular commercial use , the Wrights ' machine was laughed off as frivolous ; even the brothers thought that only national governments would have the resources to build and fly airplanes . " It is doubtful if aeroplanes will ever cross the ocean , " the eminent Harvard astronomer William Picketing scoffed in 1908 , according to Hallion 's history . " The public has greatly overestimated the possibilities of the aeroplane , imagining that in another generation they will be able to fly over to London in a day This is manifestly impossible . " <p> Such disdain chilled U.S. investment in aviation . Between 1908 and 1913 , the U.S. government spent only $435,000 on aviation-less than Germany , France , Chile and even Bulgaria . European inventors and entrepreneurs were soon building better , faster and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wright airplane was superseded by European designs as early as 1910 , " says Jakab . German , Russian and especially French aviators and inventors soon dominated the skies , as our vocabulary attests ; " aviation , " " aileron , " " fuselage " and " helicopter " all have French origins . <p> For all the Wrights ' achievements , their aircraft were still iffy . Half-a-dozen pilots were killed flying Wright flyers in a one-year period starting in 1909 ; other early planes were also dangerous . " Europeans were n't learning from the Wright experience how to fly , they were learning how to fly better , " Hallion writes . Designers like Louis Blriot moved the Wrights ' " pusher " propellers to the front of the plane , which simplified the design ( a rear-mounted propeller requires more elaborate structures for the rudders and elevators ) . The original biplane configuration  --  which was strong , fight and generated a lot of lift  --  dominated airplane design until the early 1930s , when monoplanes , which are faster , took over . <p> At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come into its own as a military and commercial technology The open-cockpit , largely wood-and-fabric airplanes jousting in Europe 's skies-planes like the British Sopwith Camel and the German Albatros  --  were faster and far more nimble than the Wright Flyer , but still dangerous . Heroes like Manfred yon Richthofen ( the " Red Baron " ) and America 's Eddie Rickenbacker created the mystique of the fighter ace , but thousands of others perished in the air . In 1917 , the life expectancy of a British fighter pilot in a combat zone , Hallion writes , was three weeks . <p> But the war speeded up development of the fledgling aviation industry . The first passenger flight had been in 1908 , when Wilbur Wright carried one Charles Furnas during tests of the Wright Flyer . Scheduled passenger flights did not begin in earnest until January 1 , 1914 , when Tony Jannus , an entrepreneurial Florida pilot , started flying $5 hops across Tampa Bay . Planes flying at low speeds and low altitudes were buffeted by winds , causing a bumpy  --  and often sickening  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gas fumes . And bad weather kept planes on the ground , making air travel unreliable . Yet public demand accelerated . <p> In the 1920s and ' 30s , investment by industry and government fueled innovation . Wood frames and cloth skins gave way to all-metal designs , which in turn made possible larger , stronger craft , streamlining , sealed cabins and high-altitude flight . Also important were reliable flight instruments such as the artificial horizon , altimeter and directional gyroscope , crucial to flying in poor weather ( and keeping airlines on schedule ) . By 1932 , U.S. airlines were flying more than 475,000 passengers a year . <p> In 1935 , aviation reached a new peak  --  and , oddly perhaps , something of a plateau  --  with the development of the Douglas Aircraft Company 's DC-3 . With 21 seats , all-metal construction , a streamlined design , retractable landing gear , automatic pilot and a cruising speed of almost 200 miles per hour , the DC-3 is considered by many experts the pinnacle of the propeller-driven plane , and set the pattern for planes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propellers faster and faster  --  at their tips , they broke the sound barrier  --  engineers came up against baffling aerodynamic properties . Shock waves and unpredicted turbulence undermined performance . Propellers lost efficiency and thrust when they neared supersonic speeds . <p> The man who overcame that limit was not a professional engineer . Frank Whittle , a machinist 's son and Royal Air Force pilot , came up with the idea for a jet engine while serving as a flight instructor in the early 1930s . " Whittle was an odd duck pushing an idea everyone thought was kind of nuts , " says historian Roger Bilstein , author of Flight in America : From the Wrights to the Astronauts . " Nobody thought it would work . " <p> Whittle persisted , eventually scraping together the resources to design a workable jet engine on his own . The concept , at any rate , is simple : air coming in at the front of the engine is compressed and combined with fuel , then ignited ; the burning mixture roars out the back of the jet , generating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the front of the engine . <p> Whittle 's jet engine was first tested in the lab in 1937 and , four years later , powered a specially designed fighter at an air base near Gloucester , England . Pilots watching the top-secret test flight from the side of the damp airfield were baffled . " My God , chaps , I must be going round the bend , " one officer reportedly said later . " It had n't got a propeller ! " <p> Meanwhile , a German engineer named Hans yon Ohain had been developing his own jet engine , in 1944 , a handful of jet fighters and bombers , including the Messerschmitt Me 262  --  the world 's first operational jet  --  saw service in the Luftwaffe . In America , military brass put jets on a back burner , convinced the war would be won with conventional airplanes , and lots of them . Diverting resources to work on the unproven jet , authorities insisted , would be a waste of time . But after the Allies swept through Germany at the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rocket scientists , including Wernher yon Braun , and then took them to the United States in " Operation Paperclip . " The plan laid the groundwork for decades of U.S.-led innovation , from immediately useful jet technology to advances in rocketry that would ultimately make the space program possible . <p> Jet propulsion technology was the most important thing in aviation since the Wrights . " The jet was n't a refinement of anything , it was a complete breakthrough , " says NASM 's Anderson . " A whole second era of aviation was opened up by Whittle and yon Ohain . " Yet the jet 's inventors never got the recognition the Wrights enjoyed . Whittle 's patents were appropriated by the British government during the war , and yon Ohain quietly began a new career in 1947  --  as a U.S. Air Force propulsion scientist . <p> Yet it would take years of painstaking work to turn the jet plane into reliable transportation , in the early days , fighter jet pilots had a one in four chance of dying in an airplane accident . Supersonic speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions about aerodynamics , control and efficiency The design of the X-I , which broke the sound barrier over California 's Muroc Dry Lake in 1947 , was based on the .50-caliber bullet , an object that engineers knew went supersonic . It was flown by laconic West Virginian test pilot Chuck Yeager , a veteran World War II ace who counted two Messerschmitt 262s among his kills . <p> THE BRAVERY of those test pilots is what we tend to remember of jet travel 's early days . But perhaps more important was the massive government expenditure on aviation and space research in the 1950s and ' 60s . By 1959 , the aviation industry was one of the largest employers in America 's manufacturing sector , with more than 80 percent of its sales in the decade and a half after World War II to the military . America 's aviation and space successes became potent symbols in the cold war , and the booming aerospace industry got what amounted to a blank check from the government . After all , as a character in the movie version of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buck Rogers . " <p> " Government investment in things related to flight drove a whole broad front of technological development , " Crouch says . " One thing after another developed because it was somehow related to flight , and governments were spending money on it . " Computers became ubiquitous aviation tools , from aiding design of complex aircraft to forming global ticketing networks . The jet engine also took civil aviation to new heights  --  and speeds . Boeing introduced a prototype of the 707 passenger jet in 1954 that could fly more than 600 mph ( three times faster than the DC-3 ) . Four years later , Pan American began regular 707 service from New York to Paris , ushering in the jet age . <p> As the hard-won lessons of military test pilots yielded safer , more stable jet designs , the very shape of the world began to change . From massive B-52 nuclear bombers capable of flying nonstop from Omaha to Moscow in 11 hours , to passenger jets that could cross the Atlantic in 7 hours , the jet made international travel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  the 452-passenger Boeing 747 debuted in 1969  --  and the number of people who flew climbed steadily each year . <p> Supersonic passenger planes were the next obvious frontier . But with the exceptions of the Soviet Tupolev TU-144 , which first flew in December 1968 , and the Concorde , a joint venture between France and Britain that took off two months later , supersonic passenger travel would remain largely a novelty . Both planes were a bust financially In almost 30 years flying across the Atlantic at twice the speed of sound , the gas-guzzling Concorde never broke even . Air France ceased regularly scheduled Concorde service this past May and British Airways in October . Nonetheless , entrepreneurs and politicians have continued to float futuristic ( and so far impractical ) ideas , like the Orient Express , a massive supersonic transport that would carry up to 200 passengers from New York to Beijing in two hours , skipping like a stone across the earth 's atmosphere at Mach 5 . <p> Attaining ever-higher speeds has n't necessarily been the highest priority for the military : Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the new planes , with smaller , angled wings and control surfaces , tended to be unstable . That changed with the development in the 1970s of onboard computers , or " fly-by-wire " systems , in aviation lingo , capable of making thousands of adjustments per second to rudders and other control surfaces . The Northrop B-2 stealth bomber and the Lockheed F-117A Nighthawk stealth fighter , bizarre matte-black bundles of strange angles and stubby wings designed to disappear from enemy radar , seem to defy the laws of aerodynamics with the help of sophisticated software . The ultimate fly-by-wire technology , unmanned aerial vehicles , or UAVs , are remote-controlled drones , which have already seen service in the skies over Afghanistan and Iraq . <p> To many aviation experts , airplane technology seems to have hit another lull in the rate of progress . " That 's the big question : Is the airplane in its form now a mature technology ? " says NASM curator Jeremy Kinney : " The airlines are doing very well with wide-body , turbofan planes carrying hundreds of people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even a next plateau ? " <p> Engineers hope so . " Sure , we 've reached a certain level of maturity over the last part of the 20th century that some see as a plateau , the same as in the ' 30s , " says the Smithsonian 's Anderson , a former chairman of the University of Maryland 's Aerospace Engineering Department . " I believe this is a platform from which we 'll jump off and see dramatic advances . " In addition to improvements in the efficiency and performance of existing aircraft , technological refinements may soon allow amazing accomplishments : fly-by-wire systems that keep a plane aloft with one wing shot off , the reduction or even elimination of sonic booms , and unmanned aircraft capable of dramatic maneuvers that would kill a pilot . <p> Curiously , some of the most advanced research going on right now bears a striking resemblance to innovations the Wrights made more than a century ago . At NASA 's Dryden Flight Research Center in Edwards , California , engineers in the Active Aeroelastic Wing Program have equipped an F/A18 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibilities of aeroelastic wing design  --  essentially a version of the Wrights ' wing-warping , albeit one that uses very advanced computer systems to induce wings to change shape at supersonic speeds . Aeroelastic wings make rolling , banking turns possible by twisting the wing itself , improving performance at supersonic speeds . " Very few birds fly With ailerons or leading edge flaps , " quips Dick Ewers , a NASA test pilot on the project . Instead , he says , birds change the shape of their wings , depending on how fast or slow they 're going and whether they 're turning , climbing , diving or soaring . " Airplanes spend a lot of weight and money making wings stiff , " he goes on . The aeroelastic wing will eventually do away with flaps and move the plane by changing the shape of the wing itself , he predicts : " Rather than stiffen the wing , we want to let it be flexible and take advantage of it . " <p> A Centennial of Flight logo on the prototype plane proudly heralds the project 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share an inspiration with the Wrights , who successfully guided their Flyer in three dimensions by shifting the shape of its wings . " One hundred years later , we may discover that the Wright brothers ' answers were more correct aerodynamically than what we 've been living with for 80 years , " says Dave Voracek , the project 's chief engineer . " We 've really come full circle .
