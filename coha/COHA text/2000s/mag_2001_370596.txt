I like to call him Bello Nock  --  his clown name and his family name . Although he does n't act like it , Bello , who keeps his real first name secret , is aristocracy . Members of the Nock family ( their performance roots date back to the 18th century in Switzerland ) have been circus artists and great clowns for generations . I saw Bello 's uncle Pio Nock in the Ringling show when I was 22 , and I applied immediately to the Ringling Bros . Clown College . Bello 's thoroughly American accent  --  he speaks many languages , but all of them like a guy from Florida , which he is  --  does n't mask his European take on the art of circus . That 's not a better point of view than the American , but it is different . <P> Trained from childhood , Bello , 32 , has a grounding in almost every circus skill . This is one of the things that separate him from those of us who found our way to clowning from the theater . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strongest men I 've ever known ) , and so when he does a bit about setting up a trampoline , of course he gets in trouble and finds some great gags . He 's caught in the springs , first his foot , then his whole body , but he finishes with world-class trampoline work  --  going breathtakingly high , swooping into a suicide dive , tucking at the last second , then getting caught in the springs again . <P> Bello and I once put together a two-minute number for a TV show . Bello when he 's not performing is a lot like Bello when he is  --  wide-eyed , charged with energy . We never actually did the gig  --  the schedule did n't work out or something  --  but I 'll pay him these compliments , from one clown to another : first , I had a great time  --  Bello is one of the sunniest and most generous men I 've ever known . Essentially I was just there that day as a comic feed , and elder statesman , to feature some of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blown completely out of the water . As with any great practitioner , he had me on my toes and trying to get on my best game . It was a wonderful afternoon . <P> So is Bello Nock a " clown 's clown " ? That 's a hard one , because  --  this little essay notwithstanding  --  clowns tend not really to talk about one another too much . But if you get past the unanswerable questions like , Who 's the best ? or Who 's the funniest ? or Whose gig would you most like to have ? and you just ask , Whom do you like to go see ? then it gets easier . There are only a few clowns I love to see again and again , and Bello Nock is one of them . He 's really , really good , and he has a really good time ; his work fits the circus ring , and he loves the crowd . And his high-layout somersault with his pants falling off just really gets me , it always has . <P> Bill Irwin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , playwright and clown .
