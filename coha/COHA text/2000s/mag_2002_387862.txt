GEAR TO GET YOU PADDLING , WHETHER YOU 'RE NEW TO CANOES OR HAVE LAKE WATER RUNNING THROUGH YOUR VEINS. // IN 20 YEARS OF EXPLORING NORTH AMERICA 'S WILDERNESS WATERWAYS , I 'VE COVERED MORE THAN 10,000 LIQUID MILES . I 'VE PADDLED THE BREADTH OF CANADA TWICE AND NAVIGATED ALASKAN RIVERS WITH YOUNG CHILDREN IN TOW . ALONG THE WAY , I 'VE USED BATTERED ALUMINUM CANOES AND SLEEK CRAFT THAT COST MORE THAN MY FIRST CAR . HERE 'S WHAT I 'VE LEARNED : A LOT OF THINGS WILL FLOAT , BUT IT 'S WISE TO INVEST IN A BOAT THAT WILL PERFORM WELL AND LAST A LIFETIME . HERE IS A SAMPLING OF THE BEST CRAFT AND ACCESSORIES I 'VE ENCOUNTERED FOR ALL-PURPOSE , MULTIDAY BACKCOUNTRY PADDLING . TRIPPING CANOES AND KAYAKS A good wilderness-tripping boat-designed for a broad range of paddling conditions and made from durable , low  --  maintenance materials-is worth a few extra bucks . The three canoes we recommend cost less than $1,000 , but each easily could be the only boat you 'll ever need . Ditto for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Old Town Discovery 169 $799 * Length : 16 ' 9 " Weight ( mfr. ) : 85 lbs . This value-priced canoe serves as a wilderness workhorse . With a durable hull and roomy 1,000  --  pound carrying capacity , the Discovery 169 is an affordable way to get into backcountry paddling without sacrificing quality . The canoe is designed to handle the varied demands of wilderness waterways . Its slightly arched hull and sharp entry lines give it good cruising speed and stability while resisting the push of crosswinds . A bit of rocker ( the amount of curve in a canoe 's keel between bow and stem ) allows for maneuverability in rough water . Old Town 's proprietary polyethylene Superlink 3 hull material is slightly heavier than Royalex ( another common option ) , but it 's just as tough and less expensive to produce . Altogether , the Discovery 169 's features create a boat that serves capably as both a touring cruiser and a backcountry load hauler .

Reader service #102 Dagger Trinidad $1,700 * Length : 17 ' 5 " Weight ( mfr. ) : 85 lbs . This tandem sea kayak is ideal for paddlers who want to go fast and light . Want to cover a lot of watery miles , pronto ? Tandem kayaks are stable and fast , with a short learning curve if you stick to flat water . The catch ? They do n't have quite the carrying capacity of canoes , so on long trips you 'll have to think like a backpacker . Dagger 's Trinidad is my favorite tandem because it combines all the qualities I consider essential in a backcountry touring kayak . It 's very stable and predictable in ocean or lake water , yet surprisingly fast as a cruiser . For a large boat , the Trinidad even handles respectably in surf and rough water . The cockpits/seats are comfortable and adjustable , the hatches hold two large backpack 's worth of gear ( 11,500 cubic inches ) , the rudder makes for easy steering , and the EXL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Dagger , ( 800 ) 433  --  1969 ; www.dagger.com . Reader service #105 . We-no-nah Aurora $995 * Length : 16 ' Weight ( mfr. ) : 64 lbs . Here 's a backcountry boat with the responsive agility of a smaller craft . The Aurora adopts many features of We-no-nah 's classic 17  --  foot Spirit II , but employs a shorter , modified hull that makes it ideal for general backcountry tripping . Made from tough , synthetic Royalex ( also available in lighter , more expensive Kevlar ) , the Aurora 's compact size still easily swallows the load for trips of up to a week or two . The hull has a shallow arch , which translates to solid stability and nice handling in waves or chop , and a slight rocker to aid maneuverability . The most impressive quality of the Aurora is its ability to embrace the duties of a tripping boat , while retaining the nimbleness of a smaller class of canoe .

This do-it-all canoe is great for general backcountry use and even short expeditions . The Pioneer , new for 2002 , is an evolution of one of my favorite backcountry canoes , Mad River 's proven Explorer . The Pioneer 's long-lasting Royalex hull can hold half a ton of gear while retaining plenty of freeboard for rough water . The design boasts an asymmetrical hull for greater speed , along with a touch of tumblehome ( an inward curve of the hull ) for easier paddling reach . The V  --  shaped bottom tracks well across open expanses , holds against slippage in a crosswind , and works well for " ferry " maneuvers in whitewater . A slight rocker also adds to the canoe 's ability to dodge through turbulence . CONTACT : Mad River Canoe Company , ( 800 ) 311-7245 ; www.madrivercanoe.com . Reader service #104 .

Not everyone has a paddling partner . Not everyone wants a paddling partner . If you 're drawn to the freedom , autonomy , and joy of paddling alone , check boats by Bell , which makes some of the loveliest , best  --  handling solo canoes available . The Merlin II is my favorite . The stable hull is comforting to beginning paddlers , but has the speed and maneuverability to reward advanced canoeists . The Merlin If carries loads of up to 650 pounds , plenty for a lone traveler and an expeditions worth of gear . The fiberglass/ Kevlar ( White Gold model ) hull design features tumblehome for efficient paddling motion , enough rocker for dodging through turbulence , and crisp entry lines that add hull speed and tracking ability .

Reader service #107 ScanSport PakCanoe 160 $1,695 * Length : 16 ' Weight ( mfr. ) : 50 lbs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spaces on the map . A common dilemma is how to transport a big , bulky boat on remote wilderness trips . The solution ? PakCanoes , the first folding boats I 've used that can withstand the rigors of the backcountry , assemble quickly ( 20 minutes ) , and handle as sweetly as traditional canoes ( actually drier in waves ) . Best of all , the 16-foot model stuffs into a large duffel you can check on a plane . The canvaslike hull is coated with abrasion-resistant PVC for protection from rocks . An additional laminate of closed  --  cell foam protects the bottom , and the whole thing stretches over an anodized aluminum  --  tubing framework . After a 2  --  week expedition down the Yukon River , the hull of my PakCanoe looked positively unscathed . The 160 is ideal for multiday , backcountry journeys .

Sealline Dry Bags If there 's one thing you can count on in wilderness paddling , it 's that at some point all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the need for dry bags . For canoe portaging , I use the Sealline Boundary Pack 70 ( $64 ) because of its large capacity ( almost 4,000 cubic inches ) , secure double  --  sealing closure , reinforced bottom , and detachable shoulder straps . For kayak touring , I prefer Sealline 's Kodiak 25 ( $24 ) dry bag because it 's reliably watertight , has adequate capacity ( 1,480 cubic inches ) , and slides easily through small hatches .

With the Knu-Pac line of portaging packs ( $220 to $275 ) , canoes and kayaks carry easily and comfortably . Atop the external frame models are two goalpostlike cradles . Your canoe 's thwarts ( or yoke ) rest on these brackets , balancing the load and distributing the weight through the pack frame to your hips and legs . This also elevates your boat , dramatically increasing your range of vision . Choose a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ available in an internal frame .

Extrasport Contour Plus When shopping for a lifejacket , your priority should be a vest that fits comfortably and securely , does n't chafe in the armpits , adjusts easily , and is sufficiently buoyant ( make sure the jacket is a certified Type III PFD ) . Wear your paddling clothes to the store and try on several models . Grab a paddle off the rack and take a few imaginary strokes . My favorite personal flotation device ( PFD ) is the Extrasport Contour Plus . An excellent value at $72.95 , it sports large , comfortable arm holes , five points of adjustment , a mesh utility pocket , and a large zipper pull for easy use with cold hands .

My favorite is the Bending Branches Arrow ( $55.95 ) , which I 've used for thousands of miles without a blister .
