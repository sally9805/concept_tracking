<p> Simpsonville , S.C .  --  He marked the day in the den . A half-century after his halfcourt prayer was answered , precisely 50 years since that starry , starry night he scored 100 points in a college basketball game , Frank Selvy celebrated by playing neither basketball nor golf . Rather , he played with Poopie , a Yorkshire terrier . <p> " It 's nice to be remembered after all these years , " Selvy said in the comfort of his home , just off the 16th fairway at Holly Tree Country Club . " Too cold to play golf , so might as well sit here . " <p> On the evening of Feb. 13 , 1954 , more than 4,000 fans jammed old Textile Hall in Greenville , including a 22-car motorcade that drove six hours from Corbin , Ky. , Selvy 's hometown . The overflow crowd included Iva Corbin , who 'd never seen her son ( " The Corbin Comet , " as Frank was known then ) play basketball . Iva rode a train to Greenville to attend " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the postgame delirium , once the crowd had carried her boy around the court in triumph , Iva beamed and asked Frank , " Why 'd you do that ? " <p> " I did n't know what she was saying , " Selvy recalled . " I thought she meant I was being selfish , should 've let some other guys score . But over the years , I realized she was asking if I did it for her . And I probably did . <p> " I just wanted to show her how good I was , " he said . " So I played as hard as I could that night . " <p> Against little Newberry College , Selvy scored 100 points . He remains the only man in NCAA Division I play to reach the century mark , and one of three players in basketball history to do so . Wilt Chamberlain of the Philadelphia Warriors scored 100 points against the New York Knicks on March 2 , 1962 , in a 48-minute NBA game . On Feb. 2 , 1954 , 6-foot-9 Bevo Francis of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a Division II game . <p> Eleven days later , the 6-foot-3 Selvy made 41 baskets against Newberry , all 2-pointers . There was no 3-point line back then . He hit 18 of 22 free throws . Selvy 's last two points came on his 66th and final shot of the night . The rainbow , which he estimated at " 40 , maybe 42 feet , " was launched just beyond halfcourt and dropped through the net as the horn sounded . <p> " I 'd made so many shots , I just felt like it might as well go in , " Selvy said . " It went dead-center . " <p> The old gym rocked to the rafters . Even the 21-year-old coal miner 's son , still humble 50 years later , was ecstatic having hit 100 . " Heck , yeah , " Selvy said . " I think 100 sounds a lot better than 98 , or 99 . Even 101 ; 100 sounds a lot better . " <p> No one-night wonder <p> Fifty years hence , 100 echoes sweetly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Selvy , " I do n't think people would know who I was as a basketball player . " <p> Selvy was no 100 singular sensation . He was a first-team All-American in 1953 and ' 54 . He led the nation in scoring each season , averaging 29.5 points as a junior and 41.7 as a senior , when UPI named him its national player of the year . That 41.7 was the NCAA season record until Pete Maravich topped it thrice from 1968-70 ; Selvy 's 41.7 still is fourth on the NCAA list . <p> The first pick in the 1954 NBA draft by the Baltimore Bullets , Selvy played for four teams in a nine-year career that was interrupted by a three-year hitch in the Army . As a Knick , he met his wife of 45 years , Barbara , a former Miss Arkansas-turned-TV actress in New York . Selvy played one season with the Minneapolis Lakers before the team moved to Los Angeles . But not before a harrowing flight in 1960 , when the Lakers ' team plane lost its generators and nearly crashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're gon na make it . We 're gon na make it . " <p> In L.A. , Selvy played with Jerry West and Elgin Baylor and nearly helped dethrone Boston in the ' 62 NBA finals . But his 15-footer at the end of regulation in Game 7 missed after Bob Cousy bumped Selvy 's arm . The Celtics won in overtime . Yet Selvy 's still known as the 100-point man . " This is why they know me , " he said . " So I guess it 's good . " <p> Lyles Alley , Selvy 's coach at Furman , was a showman who wanted to make " Frank Selvy Night " memorable . He had a seven-piece jazz band ( including a washboard player ) to perform at halftime . The Furman-Newberry game was broadcast by WFBC-TV , the first televised sporting event in the state of South Carolina . <p> Alley hired a cameraman to film the game with a 16mm camera . And the coach decided , in essence , " Let 's be Frank , fellas . Let 's get the ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play in the first five seconds . Newberry 's Bobby Bailey , who 'd held Selvy to 23 points earlier that season in a close Furman victory , fouled out in the first 2:43 . <p> College basketball was then played in four 10-minute quarters , not 20-minute halves . Selvy scored 24 points in the first period . People around town , watching on TV , descended on Textile Hall , hoping to get inside . More than 1,000 were turned away . By halftime , Selvy had 37 points and Furman  --  a power in the pre-integration Southern Conference  --  led 77-44 . <p> The halftime show included an exhibition basketball game . Selvy 's five younger brothers , all wearing his No. 28 jersey , played against a group of Greenville kids . Selvy 's sister , Stella , was the referee . In the Furman locker room , Alley made two vital decisions : <p> * The Paladins switched from their white home uniforms to their purple away jerseys , so their numbers would show up better on TV . <p> * Alley decided to bench Darrell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation in scoring the next season , and who had scored 25 first-half points . " The guys who played in the second half were mostly subs , who had n't played much all year , " said Selvy . Their goal : Feed Frank . <p> " Wherever I went , " Selvy said , " they threw it to me . " <p> After three quarters on Textile Hall 's tiny 82-foot court ( 12 feet shy of regulation ) , Selvy had 63 points , Furman a 109-66 lead . By then , it was clear Newberry had decided to run along with Furman . Still , Selvy was far short of 100 . <p> But then he scored 37 of Furman 's 40 fourth-quarter points . " I do n't know who scored that other three , " Selvy said . He used a dazzling array of shots , including his signature spinning left- and right-handed hook shots . As the public-address announcer updated his point total with each basket , the crowd roared . <p> Selvy was at 98 when Alley called a timeout with " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Let the Newberry guy drive in , do n't guard him . ' " The player missed . Furman rebounded . Alley called time again . <p> " The play was for me to hang out near midcourt , and go and try to get a shot , " Selvy said . <p> Last shot memorable <p> Al Kyber passed to Selvy in the backcourt . " I took two , three dribbles , " he said . " They had three guys on me . They fouled me but the refs did n't call it . I spun to get away and threw it up , a desperation shot . " <p> An historic bull's-eye . Selvy outscored Newberry in Furman 's 149-95 win . On the black-and-white , silent game film , Selvy was hoisted by fans and paraded around the court . <p> With the 3-point shot , Selvy figures he might 've scored 10 to 15 more points that night . In his basement , there 's a framed replica of that box score and one of the Textile Hall backboards , saved by Selvy 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game ball ? Selvy took it home to Corbin , where his younger brothers played with it on an outdoor court . " It 's gone , worn out , " he said . " Those dirt courts , they wear out the balls . " <p> A shy , humble man , Selvy returned to Furman after the NBA , spent two years as an assistant coach , then four as head coach ( his record : 44-59 ) . But he was far more nervous as a coach , ill at ease speaking in public . Selvy quit coaching and spent 25 years with the St. Joe 's Paper Co. selling boxes . <p> When Furman wanted to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Selvy 's 100-point game with a banquet , he balked . " That 's not me , to do something like that , " Selvy said . Instead , Selvy will be honored at halftime of Furman 's Feb. 21 home game against The Citadel ; he insisted that several surviving college teammates be invited , too . <p> " I 'm proud of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Selvy , enshrined in the Kentucky and South Carolina sports halls of fame . " It does n't even that much to me . . . . There 's a lot of things more important than that . " <p> A victory over Dick Groat and mighty Duke as a sophomore . Beating South Carolina five out of six times , Clemson four of five . " I 've talked about the 100-point game so much , I do n't mind talking about it . " said Selvy . " But I 'd really rather talk about golf . That 's my passion now . " <p> * Great basketball tales come from all four corners , and between now and the Final Four we 'll take you there .
