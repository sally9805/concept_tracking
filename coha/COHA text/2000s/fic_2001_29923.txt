Tory To me , fair friend , you never can be old , For as you were when first your eye I eyed , Such seems your beauty still . - William Shakespeare She woke in the body of a dead friend . She was eight , tall for her age , fragile of bone , delicate of feature . Her hair was the color of corn silk , and slid prettily down her narrow back . Her mother loved to brush it every night , one hundred strokes with the soft-bristled , silver-backed brush that sat on the graceful cherrywood vanity . The child 's body remembered this , felt this , each long , sustained beat with the brush and how it made her imagine herself a cat being petted . How the light slanted over the pin boxes and the bottles of crystal and cobalt , and struck the silver back of the brush as it flashed over her hair . She remembered the scent of the room , smelled it even now . Gardenia . Always gardenia for Mama . And in the mirror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her face , so young , so pretty , with those thoughtful blue eyes and smooth skin . So alive . Her name was Hope . The windows and French doors were closed because it was high summer . Heat pressed its damp fingers against the glass , but inside the house the air was cool , and her cotton nightgown stayed so crisp it crackled when she moved . It was the heat she wanted , and the adventure , but she kept those thoughts inside as she kissed Mama good night . A dainty peck against a perfumed cheek . Mama had the hall runners taken up and rolled into the attic every June . Now the loblolly pine floors with their coating of paste wax felt slick and smoothunder the young girl 's bare feet as she wandered out , down the hall with its panels of bald cypress and paintings in thick frames of dull gold . Up the sharp , winding curves of the stairs to her father 's study . There her father 's scent . Smoke , leather , Old Spice , and bourbon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and big , heavy chairs with leather the color of the port her papa sometimes drank after supper . Here the circling shelves were jammed full with books and treasures . She loved the man who sat behind the enormous desk with his cigar and his shot glass and his ledgers . The love was an ache of the heart in the woman inside the child , a shaft of longing and of envy for that uncomplicated and complete love . His voice boomed , his arms were strong and his stomach soft as he enveloped her in a hug that was so different from the gentle and restrained good-night kiss from Mama . There 's my princess , going off to the kingdom of dreams . What will I dream about , Papa ? Knights and white chargers and adventures over the sea . She giggled , but rested her head on his shoulder a bit longer than usual , humming a little in her throat like a purring kitten . Did she know ? Somehow did she know she would never sit safe on his lap again ? Back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bedtime , not yet , because he was four years older and a boy and could stay up late on summer nights watching TV or reading books as long as he was up and ready for his chores in the morning . One day Cade would be the master of Beaux Reves , and sit at the big desk in the tower study with the ledgers . He would do the hiring and firing and oversee the planting and the harvest and smoke cigars at meetings and complain about the government and the price of cotton . Because he was the son . That was fine with Hope . She did n't want to have to sit at a desk and add up figures . She stopped in front of her sister 's door , hesitated . It was n't fine with Faith . Nothing ever seemed to be all right with Faith . Lilah , the housekeeper , said Miss Faith would argue with God Almighty just to irritate Him . Hope supposed that was true , and even though Faith was her twin , she did n't understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just tonight she 'd been sent straight to her room for sassing . Now the door was shut tight and there was no light under it . Hope imagined Faith was staring up at the ceiling with that sulky look on her face and her fists clenched tight as if she waited to box with the shadows . Hope touched the doorknob . Most times she could coax Faith out of those black moods . She could huddle in bed with her in the dark and make up stories until Faith laughed and the spit in her eyes dried up again . But tonight was for other things . Tonight was for adventures . It was all planned , but Hope did n't let the excitement come until she was in her own room with the door shut . She left the light off , moving quietly in the dark that was silvered by moonlight . She changed her cotton gown for shorts and a T-shirt . Her heart drummed pleasantly in her chest as she arranged the pillows on the bed in a shape that to her naive and childish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she took her adventure kit . The old dome-topped lunch box held a bottle of Coca-Cola gone warm , a bag of cookies sneaked carefully from the kitchen jar , a small , rusted penknife , matches , a compass , a water pistol-fully loaded-and a red plastic flashlight . For a moment she sat on the floor . She could smell her crayons , and the talc that clung to her own skin from after her bath . She could hear , just barely hear , the music drifting out from her mother 's sitting room . When she slid her window open , quietly took out the screen , she was smiling . Young , agile , and bright with anticipation , she swung her leg over the sill , found a toehold in the trellis mad with vining wisteria . The air was like syrup , and the hot , sweet flavor of it filled her lungs as she climbed down . A splinter stabbed into her finger , causing her to hiss in a breath . But she kept moving , keeping her eyes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadow , she thought , and no one would see her . She was Hope Lavelle , girl spy , and had a meeting with her contact and partner at precisely ten thirty-five . She had to stifle a giggle , and was breathless from the laughter that wanted to bubble out as she hit the ground . To add to her own excitement , she darted and dashed behind the thick trunks of the grand old trees that shaded the house , then peeked around them toward the faint blue light that pulsed against the window in the room where her brother watched TV , up to the clearer yellow glow where each of her parents spent their evening . Discovery now would mean disaster for the mission , she thought , crouching as she raced through the gardens and the sweet scent of roses and night-blooming jasmine . She must avoid capture at all costs , as the fate of the world rested on her shoulders and those of her stalwart partner . The woman inside the child screamed out . Go back , oh please , go back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her pink bike out from behind the camellias , where she 'd stashed it that afternoon , snuggled her kit into the white basket , then pushed it over the cushion of grass alongside the long gravel drive until the house , and the lights , were dim with distance . When she rode , she rode like the wind , imagining the pretty little bike was a souped-up motorcycle , complete with nerve gas dispenser and oil slick shooter . The white plastic streamers danced from the ends of the handlebars and slapped each other gaily . She flew through the thick air , and the chorus of peepers and cicadas became the panther roar of her speeding machine . At the fork in the road , she bore left , then jumped nimbly off her bike to wheel it off the road , down into the narrow gully where it would be hidden by brush . Though the moon was bright enough , she took the flashlight out of her kit . The smiling Princess Leia on her watch told her she was fifteen minutes early . Without fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the marsh . Into the end of summer , of childhood . Of life . There the world was alive with sound , water and insects and small night creatures . The light came in thinning ribbons through the canopy of tupelo and cypress with its dripping moss . Here magnolia blossoms grew fat with a perfume high and sweet . The way to the clearing was second nature to her . This meeting place , this secret place , was well tended , guarded , and loved . As the first to arrive , she took old twigs and stubby branches from the stockpile of wood and set to making a fire . The smoke discouraged mosquitoes , but she scratched idly at bites already dotting her legs and arms . She settled down to wait with a cookie and her Coke . As time passed her eyes drooped , and the music of the marsh lulled her . The fire ate through the thin scraps of wood , then settled down to a simmer . Drifting , she rested her cheek on her updrawn knees . At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down twisting Paris streets to evade the wicked Russian spy . But the snap of a twig underfoot had her head jerking up and the sleep clearing from her eyes . The wide grin came first , but she quickly shifted into the stern professional expression of a top secret agent . Password ! There was silence in the marsh but for the monotonous buzz of insects and the faint crackle of a fire dying . She scrambled to her feet , the flashlight cocked in her hand like a gun . Password ! she called again and aimed the short beam of light . But now the rustle came from behind her , so she whirled , heart leaping , beam dancing in nervous jerks . Fear , something so rarely tasted in eight short years , slicked hot and burning in her throat . Come on , cut it out . You 're not scaring me . A sound from the left , deliberate , taunting . As the next snake of fear curled in her gut she took a step in retreat . And heard the laughter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through thick shadows and jumping light . Terror so sharp in the throat that it slices screams before they can escape . Footsteps pounding behind her . Fast , too fast , and too close . Something hits her from behind . Bright pain in her back that vibrates down to the soles of her feet . The jolt of bone and breath as she falls hard to the ground . Air rushes out of her lungs in a sob as the weight of him pins her down . She smells sweat and whiskey . She screams now , one long cry of desperation , and calls out for her friend . Tory ! Tory , help me ! And the woman trapped inside the dead child weeps . When Tory came back to herself she was lying on the flagstones of her patio , wearing only a nightshirt already soaked through from the thin spring rain . Her face was wet , and she tasted the salt of her own tears . Screams echoed in her head , but she did n't know if they were her own or those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she rolled onto her back so the rain could cool her cheeks and wash the tears away . The episodes-spells , her mother always called them-often left her weak and queasy . There had been a time she 'd been able to fight them off before they swamped her . It had either been that or the shocking sting of her father 's belt . I 'll whip the devil out of you , girl . To Hannibal Bodeen , the devil was everywhere ; in every fear and temptation lurked the hand of Satan . And he 'd done his best to drive that wickedness out of his only child . At the moment , with the sickness circling in her belly , Tory wished he 'd managed it . It amazed her that for a space of years she 'd actually embraced what was in her , had explored it , used it , even celebrated it . A legacy , her grandmother had told her . The sight . The shining . A gift of the blood through the blood . But there was Hope . More and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childhood friend 's memories hurt her heart . And frightened her . Nothing she 'd experienced , either blocking or embracing this gift , had taken her like this . Taken her away , taken her over . It made her helpless , when she 'd promised herself she would never be helpless again . Yet here she was , sprawled on her own patio in the rain without any memory of how she got outside . She 'd been in the kitchen brewing tea , standing at the counter , the lights and the music on , reading a letter from her grandmother . That was the trigger , Tory realized , as she slowly got to her feet . Her grandmother was her link to her childhood . To Hope . Into Hope , she thought , as she closed the patio door . Into the pain and fear and horror of that terrible night . And still she did n't know the who or the why . Still shivering , Tory went into the bath , stripped and , turning the shower hot , stepped under the spray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmured , closing her eyes . " I could n't help you then , I ca n't help you now . " Her best friend , her sister of the heart , had died that night in the swamp while she 'd been locked in her room , sobbing over the latest beating . And she had known . She had seen . She had been helpless . Guilt , as fresh as it had been eighteen years before , swarmed through her . " I ca n't help you , " she said again . " But I 'm coming back . " We were eight years old that summer . That long-ago summer when it seemed those thick , hot days would last forever . It was a summer of innocence and foolishness and friendship , the kind that combines to form a pretty glass globe around your world . One night changed all of that . Nothing 's been the same for me since . How could it be ? Most of my life I 've avoided speaking of it . That did n't stop the memories , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to bury it , as Hope was buried . To face it now , to record this out loud , if only for myself , is a relief . Like pulling a splinter out of the heart . The ache will linger awhile . She was my best friend . Our bond had the deep and immediate intensity only children are capable of forging . I suppose we were an odd pair , bright and privileged Hope Lavelle and dark , shy Tory Bodeen . My daddy leased a small patch of land , a little corner of the grand plantation hers owned . Sometimes when her mama gave a big society dinner or one of her lavish parties , mine would help out with the cleaning and serving . But those gaps of social standing and class never touched the friendship . Indeed , they never occurred to us . She lived in a grand house , one her reputedly eccentric ancestor had built to resemble a castle rather than the Georgian style so popular during its era . It was stone , with towers and turrets and what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing of the princess about Hope . She lived for adventures . And when I was with her , so did I. With her , I escaped from the miseries and turmoils of my own house , my own life , and became her partner . We were spies , detectives , knights on quests , pirates , or space marauders . We were brave and true , bold and daring . In the spring before that summer , we used her pocketknife to cut a narrow slice in our wrists . Solemnly , we mixed our blood . We were lucky , I suppose , we did n't end up with lockjaw . Instead we became blood sisters . She had a sister , a twin . But Faith rarely joined in our games . They were too silly for her , or too rough , too dirty . They were always too something for Faith . We did n't miss her temper or complaints . That summer , Hope and I were the twins . If someone had asked me if I loved her , I would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day since that terrible time that August , I have missed her as I have missed that part of me that died with her . We were to meet at the swamp , in our secret place . I do n't suppose it was really much of a secret , but it was ours . We often played there , in that damp green air , having our adventures among the birdsong and moss and wild azalea . It was against the rules to go in after sunset , but at eight , rules are an exciting thing to break . I was to bring marshmallows , and lemonade . Part of that was pride . My parents were poor and I was poorer , but I needed to contribute , and had counted out the money from the mason jar I hid under my bed . I had two dollars and eighty-six cents on that August night-after having bought the supplies at Hanson's-the sum account of my financial worth rested in a glass canning jar and consisted of pennies and nickels and some hard-won quarters . We had chicken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even with the fans going on high , that eating was a chore . But if there was a grain of rice on your plate , Daddy expected you to eat it and be grateful . Before supper there was grace . Depending on Daddy 's mood it would last anywhere from five minutes to twenty , while the food sat going cold and your belly grumbled and the sweat ran down your back in nasty rivers . My grandma used to say that when Hannibal Bodeen found God , even God tried to find another place to hide . He was a big man , my father , and grew thick in the chest and arms . I 've heard that he was once considered handsome . Years carve a man in different ways , and my father 's years had carved him bitter . Bitter and stern with a meanness under it all . He wore his dark hair slicked back , and his face seemed to rise out of that dome like sharp-edged rocks out of a mountain . Rocks that would flay the skin off your bones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , a burning kind of dark I recognize now in the eyes of some television preachers and street people . My mother feared him . I try to forgive her for that , for fearing him so much she never came to my side when he used his belt to whip his vengeful god into me . That night I was quiet at supper . Chances were he 'd take no notice of me if I was quiet and cleaned my plate . Inside me , the anticipation of the night was like a living thing , jittery and joyful . I kept my eyes down , trying to pace my eating so he would n't accuse me of dawdling over the food , or of bolting it . It was always a fine line to balance with Daddy . I remember the sound of the fans whirling , and of forks scraping against plates . I remember the silence , the silence of souls hiding in fear that lived in my father 's house . When my mother offered him more chicken , he thanked her politely and took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a good sign . My mother , encouraged by this , made some mention of the tomatoes and corn coming in fine , and how she 'd be canning for the next weeks . They 'd be canning over at Beaux Reves , too , and did he think it was a good idea for her to help out there as she 'd been asked . She did n't mention the wage she 'd earn . Even when Daddy 's mood was mild , you were wise not to bring up the coin that the Lavelles would dole out for a service . He was the breadwinner in his house , and we were not permitted to forget this all-important point . The room held its breath again . There were times just the mention of the Lavelles put the thunder in Daddy 's dark eyes . But that night he allowed as that would be a sensible thing . As long as she did n't neglect any of her chores under the roof he was putting over her head . This relatively pleasant response made her smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how it made her almost pretty again . Now and again , if I think very hard , I can remember Mama being pretty . Han , she called him when she was smiling . Tory and I 'll keep things going around here , do n't you worry . I 'll go on over and talk to Miss Lilah tomorrow and see about getting it all done . With the berries coming in , I 'll be making jelly , too . I know I 've got some paraffin around here , but I ca n't think where it 's got to . And that , just that casual remark about jelly and wax and absentmindedness changed everything . I suppose my mind had drifted off during their conversation , that I was thinking of the adventure to come . I spoke without thought , without knowledge of the consequences . So I said the words that damned me . The box of paraffin 's in the top shelf of the cabinet over the stove , up there behind the molasses and the cornstarch . I simply said what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wax behind the dark bottle of blackstrap , and reached for my cold sweet tea to wash down the starchy grains of rice . Before I took the first sip , I heard the silence come back , the mute wave that swamped even the monotonous hum of fans . My heart started to pound inside that vacuum , one hard hammer strike after the next , with a ringing that was only inside my own head and was the sudden and vicious pulse of blood . The pulse of fear . He spoke softly then , as he did , always did , just before the rage . How do you know where the wax is , Victoria ? How do you know it 's up there , where you ca n't see it ? Where you ca n't reach it ? I lied . It was foolish , because I was already doomed , but the lie tumbled out , a desperate defense . I told him I guess I saw Mama put it there . I just remember seeing her put it there , is all . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of seeing through lies and ripping them to uneven pieces and sticky parts . When did I see that ? Why did n't I do better in school if my memory was so keen I could remember where the paraffin was a year after the last canning season ? And how was it I knew it was behind the molasses and cornstarch and not in front of them , or beside them ? Oh , he was a clever man , my father , and never missed the smallest of details . Mama said nothing while he spoke in that soft voice , punching the words at me like fists wrapped in silk . She folded her hands , and her hands shook . Did she tremble for me ? I suppose I like to think so . But she said nothing as his voice grew louder , nothing as he shoved back from the table . Nothing as the glass slipped from my hand and crashed to the floor . A shard of it nicked my ankle , and through the rising terror I felt that little pain . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was the fair thing , the right thing to do . When he opened the cabinet , pushed aside the bottles , slowly took that square blue box of canning wax out from behind the dark molasses , I cried . I still had tears in me then , I still had hope . Even as he yanked me to my feet , I had the hope that the punishment would only be prayers , hours of prayer until my knees went numb . Sometimes , at least sometimes that summer , that was enough for him . Had n't he warned me not to let the devil in ? But still , I brought wickedness into his house , shamed him before God . I said I was sorry , that I did n't mean to . Please , Daddy , please , I wo n't do it again . I 'll be good . I begged him , he shouted scripture and with his big , hard hands dragged me toward my room , but still I begged him . It was the last time I did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you fought him . The Fourth Commandment was a sacred thing , and you would honor your father in his house , even when he beat you bloody . His face was deep red with his righteousness , big and blinding as the sun . He only slapped me once . That was all it took to stop my pleading , and my excuses . And to kill my hope . I lay across the bed on my stomach , passive now as any sacrificial lamb . The sound his belt made when he slid it out of the loops on his work pants was a snake hissing , then a crack , sharp , slick , as he snapped it . He always snapped it three times . A holy trinity of cruelty . The first whip is always the worst . No matter how many times there 's been a first , the shock and pain is stunning and rips a scream from your belly . Your body jerks in protest . No , in disbelief , then the second slap bites into you , and the third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Your humanity has been compromised , buried under an avalanche of pain and humiliation . He would preach as he beat me , and his voice would become a great roar . And under that roar was a hideous excitement , a vile sort of pleasure I did n't understand and recognize . No child should know that slippery undercoating , and from that , for a time , I was spared . The first time he beat me , I was five . My mother tried to stop him , and he blackened her eye for it . She never tried again . I do n't know what she did that night while he whaled away , beating at the devil that gave me visions . I could n't see , not with eyes nor with mind , anything but a blood-red haze . The haze was hate , but I did n't recognize that either . He left me weeping and locked the door from the outside . After a while , the pain sent me to sleep . When I awoke , it was dark and it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pain was unbearable , because you bear it . What choice is there ? I prayed , too , prayed that whatever was inside of me had finally been driven out . I did n't want to be wicked . Yet even as I prayed , the pressure built in my belly , and the tingling came , like sharp little fingers dancing over the back of my neck . It was the first time it came into me this way , and I thought I was sick , feverish . Then I saw Hope , as vividly as if I were sitting beside her in our clearing in the swamp . I smelled the night , the water , heard the whine of mosquitoes , the buzz of insects . And , like Hope , I heard the rustling in the brush . Like Hope , I felt the fear . Fresh , hot gushes of it . When she ran , I ran , my breath sobbing out so that my chest hurt from it . I saw her fall under the weight of whatever leaped out at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see clearly , though I could see her . She called for me . Screamed for me . Then I saw nothing but black . When I woke , the sun was up , and I was on the floor . And Hope was gone .
