<p> SAN FRANCISCO  --  For an epicenter view of the USA 's burgeoning " green hotel " movement , steer your hybrid rental car ( or better yet , take rapid transit ) to the Chinatown gate . <p> A block apart in this eco-conscious city , two high-profile boutique hotels are strutting their environmental bragging rights . Like an estimated two-thirds of U.S. hotels ( up from about 10% a decade ago ) , the Orchard Garden Hotel and Kimpton 's Hotel Triton ask travelers to conserve water and energy by not having linens and towels changed every day . Both hotels have installed low-flow toilets and showerheads , switched to non-toxic cleaning supplies , and print guest bills with soy-based ink on recycled paper . <p> But in other ways , the San Francisco competitors are taking divergent paths to the same goals  --  and their evolving efforts show how confusing and complex going green can be . <p> Consider soap and shampoo . <p> In bathrooms on the Triton 's designated " eco floor , " they 're dispensed via refillable , wall-mounted containers rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Triton , at 39 other Kimpton properties , and at the Orchard Garden ( which opened in late 2006 and is one of only a few hotels built to meet the non-profit U.S. Green Building Council 's stringent guidelines ) , amenities still come in individual bottles . <p> " The verdict is split , " says Orchard Garden general manager Stefan Muhle . " If you 're a four-star hotel and you put a bulk container in the bathroom , you 're cheap . If you 're an eco-hotel and you do n't have them , you 're hypocritical . " <p> Green lodging is more than " hemp , Birkenstocks and granola , " adds Muhle , who says only 15% to 20% of the Orchard Garden 's customers book the hotel because of its ecological bona fides . " We 're still trying to educate our guests that being green does n't have to mean sacrifice , and we do n't want to look like a YMCA . " <p> If a survey released last week by Starwood Hotels &; Resorts is any indication , Muhle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do . Most of 1,041 travelers polled this spring said they 're less likely to conserve water and electricity while away from home . Nearly 70% said they open a new mini-bottle of shampoo each time they shower at a hotel , 63% were more likely to leave the lights on at a hotel than at home , and three out of four think it 's important to have their hotel linens changed each day . <p> On the other hand , a recent TripAdvisor survey of more than 1,000 travelers worldwide found that 34% would pay extra to stay in an environmentally friendly hotel ( though only 9% seek them out ) , and a whopping 78% said they opt not to have sheets and towels changed when given a choice . <p> Yet the growing number of linen reuse programs can be ineffective because time-pressed housekeepers often find they get better tips if they provide fresh sheets and towels anyway , says consultant Kit Cassingham of **33;951;TOOLONG . <p> " These days , every hotel wants to say it 's green . If a chain has an executive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the front-desk clerk or a housekeeping department , " says Patricia Griffin of the Green Hotels Association . <p> Green stamp of approval ? <p> There 's no " gold standard " for defining a green hotel , notes Glenn Hasek of Green Lodging News , a year-old online newsletter . <p> New hotels can earn the U.S Green Building Council 's LEED ( Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design ) certification by curbing energy and water use , improving air quality and reducing carbon emissions . Four U.S. properties are certified now ( the Orchard Garden ; the Hilton in Vancouver , Wash. ; Gaia Napa Valley Hotel &; Spa in American Canyon , Calif. ; and Marriott Inn and Conference Center in Adelphi , Md. ) , with another 84 under construction . <p> At least nine U.S. states ( California , Florida , Maine , Michigan , New Hampshire , Pennsylvania , Vermont , Virginia and Wisconsin ) have some form of green-hotel certification program , but they have varying levels of participation and oversight . <p> " Greenwashing " issues notwithstanding , the movement has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer in the field , switched to non-toxic cleaning products in 1989 . Today , eco initiatives at the group 's three hotels range from valet parkers at Boston 's Lenox Hotel who leave gas-saving tips hanging from car mirrors to shuttle vans that use compressed natural gas at the Comfort Inn &; Suites near Boston 's airport . <p> " Americans are still the kings and queens of consumption , but it 's exciting to see how mainstream ecology issues have become . There is a perfect storm of consumer awareness , climate change and rising energy prices , " says Tedd Saunders , co-owner of The Lenox . <p> Other examples : <p> *As part of parent company Accor 's Earth Guest program , Motel 6 's nearly 900 North American properties just launched a nationwide recycling program for batteries and compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) , which use 75% less energy than conventional bulbs but contain mercury that can be hazardous if not disposed of properly . Motel 6 started replacing regular bulbs with CFLs last year . Among Accor 's other green initiatives : organic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use cold water and reduce the amount of detergent . <p> *Marriott International , which says it 's on track to cut hotel energy consumption by almost 20% between 2000 and 2010 , includes " True Green " tips in guest rooms . ( " Removing just one 20-mile trip each week from your routine can prevent more than 1,200 pounds of greenhouse gases a year . " ) <p> *This spring , Leading Hotels of the World launched a program ( lhwgreen.com ) that donates 50 cents to the non-profit group Sustainable Travel International for every night a guest stays at one of the company 's 430 properties . <p> Sustainable Travel International invests the money , designed to offset the energy used by staying in the hotel , in conservation and renewable energy . <p> Carbon offsets put some off <p> Some skeptics criticize carbon offsets as little more than " guilt trip " relievers . Leading Hotels ' website concedes it " is not the best solution for addressing climate change , " but defends " our first endeavor to help reduce unavoidable greenhouse gas emissions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World are n't the only ones making green compromises . <p> In San Francisco , Mayor Gavin Newsom just banned city departments from buying bottled water , citing the environmental impact of making , transporting and disposing of the bottles . But the Hotel Triton  --  whose eco-friendly , bamboo-floored Woody Harrelson suite was just remodeled into the ice cream-stocked Haagen-Dazs suite  --  still stocks guest rooms with plastic bottles of California-based Crystal Geyser ( $4.75 for 1.5 liters ) . Neighboring rival Orchard Garden , which started out with Norwegian Voss , now offers glass bottles of Saratoga ... from New York . <p> " We want to be as local as possible , and I would n't want to see a transcontinental strawberry on my plate , " says the Orchard Garden 's Muhle , who provides filtered tap water in the hotel 's workout room but thinks guests want the option of bottled water . " We 're not perfect , and never will be . We have to find a middle ground .
