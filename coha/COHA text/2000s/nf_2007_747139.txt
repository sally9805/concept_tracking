The study in this article investigated how academic preparation , career development skills , parental assistance , and social/environmental barriers predicted inner-city adolescents ' psychological preparation to transition into high school . Results showed that academic preparation , parents ' instrumental assistance , adolescents ' career development skills efficacy , lack of teacher and peer support , and teenage pregnancy were predictive for both boys and girls . Suggestions appropriate to assist inner-city youth in preparing for high school are offered . <p> One of the greatest challenges for professional school counselors is the retention and success of students who are at risk for academic failure ( Edmondson &; White , 1998 ) . The dropout rate among at-risk students has reached epidemic proportions in many communities . In the inner cities , where students may be placed at risk both by their minority and their socioeconomic status ( National Center for Education Statistics , 2000 ; Turner &; Lapan , 2003 ) , high school graduation rates are often less than 50% ( Greene , 2002 ) , with many students dropping out of school as early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devastating effects on communities and thus on the nation as a whole . " Children who do not graduate with a high school diploma stand little chance of sustaining themselves or a family in today 's economy " ( Greene ) . <p> The American School Counselor Association ( ASCA , 2004 ) recommends that professional school counselors at all levels make significant , vital , and indispensable contributions toward the academic , career , and personal/social success of " at-risk " students . School counselors should provide proactive leadership in the areas of ( a ) identification of at-risk students ; ( b ) preventive program planning ; ( c ) individual , group , family , and crisis counseling ; and ( d ) individual educational planning . These efforts should be focused upon the prevention of adolescents from dropping out of school , a decision that can carry with it devastating and lifelong consequences . <p> Transition theories ( Brim , 1979 ; Graber &; Brooks-Gunn , 1996 ; Schlossberg , 1984 ) suggest that one way to decrease school dropout rates among entering high school students is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , before they begin high school , can help them better adjust to the demands of a new environment . Through anticipatory socialization ( Brim ) , young people can develop the readiness , self-efficacy , perceived support , personal control , and independence to enter into and adjust to high school . This psychological preparation can increase the likelihood that they will orient more successfully to high school , gain more access to high school resources , and adapt to high school more effectively during the post-transition phase ( Catterall , 1998 ; Heppner , Multon , &; Johnston , 1994 ) . <p> Only a few studies have been conducted that investigate the psychological correlates of successful transitioning to high school ( Bullis , Davis , Bull , &; Johnson , 1997 ; Carlson , Sroufe , &; Egeland , 2004 ; Jackson , Pancer , Pratt , &; Hunsberger , 2000 ) . These researchers have shown that young people with greater positive expectations of success experience greater adjustment , and greater agreement between expected and actual experiences subsequent to transitioning . <p> In related lines of research @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' persistence with respect to their educational and vocational development . Four primary categories of variables tend to be identified in this research : ( a ) academic preparation , ( b ) career development skills training , ( c ) parental assistance , and ( d ) skills developed to overcome social and environmental barriers . For example , researchers have shown that academic preparation is predictive of adolescents ' graduation from high school ( Arbona , 2000 ; Gregory , 1995 ; Gutman , Sameroff , &; Eccles , 2002 ) . Career development skills training is predictive of adolescents ' goal orientation , goal directedness , and confidence in their abilities to pursue chosen career paths ( Janosz , LeBlanc , Boulerice , &; Tremblay , 1997 ; Lapan , Gysbers , Hughey , &; Arni , 1993 ; O'Brien , Dukstein , Jackson , Tomlinson , &; Kamatuka , 1999 ) . Parental assistance can positively influence young people 's confidence that they can succeed in their educational and vocational development ( Alliman-Brissett , Turner , &; Skovholt , 2004 ; Turner , Alliman-Brissett , Lapan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcome social and environmental barriers can positively influence adolescents ' educational plans and career expectations ( McWhirter , Hackett , &; Bandalos , 1998 ) . <p> I suggest that in the inner cities , where many low-income , minority , and single-parent families reside , the study of factors promoting successful transitioning to high school become even more critical , as inner-city adolescents often face multiple challenges such as teenage pregnancy , lack of adequate adult and peer encouragement , and overarching extended family responsibilities ( e.g. , working to contribute to the economic needs of the family ; National Research Council , 1993 ) . Therefore , the purpose of this study was to examine how inner-city adolescents ' academic preparation , career developmental skills efficacy , parental assistance , and social/environmental barriers are associated with indicators of their psychological preparation to enter into and adjust to high school . <p> Based on Schlossberg 's ( 1984 ) recommendation that the study of transitions requires the simultaneous analysis of individual characteristics and external conditions , I chose structural equation modeling , which can be used to analyze the relationships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &; Sorbom , 1993 ) . I hypothesized that among inner-city middle school adolescents , their academic preparation , career development skills efficacy in three domains ( career planning and exploration , relating to others in career and academic contexts , and understanding the links between school and work ) , and parents ' assistance in four domains ( instrumental assistance , verbal encouragement , emotional support , and role modeling ) would be positively and differentially related to their psychological preparation to transition into and adjust to high school ( Hypothesis 1 ) ; that perceived social and environmental barriers ( lack of significant adult encouragement , lack of peer encouragement ; lack of ability , lack of motivation , lack of academic preparation ; teenage pregnancy ; family responsibilities ; gender and ethnic discrimination ; leaving home ; and lack of money ) would be negatively and differentially related to their psychological preparation ( Hypothesis 2 ) ; and that there would be no significant differences between African American and Native American participants in their psychological preparation . METHOD Participants <p> Participants were 147 eighth-grade students from one inner-city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adolescents lived at or below the poverty level . Of these adolescents , 55.8% ( n = 82 ) were boys , and 44.2% ( n = 65 ) were girls ; 47.6% ( n = 70 ) were African American , 2.7% ( n = 4 ) were Asian American , 6.1% ( n = 9 ) were Hispanic/ Latino , 40.1% ( n = 59 ) were Native American , and 3.4% ( n = 5 ) reported as being of mixed heritage . The mean age of the participants was 13.05 years ( SD = .70 ) . Graduation rates in this school district at the time of data collection were comparable to those in other major metropolitan areas in the United States , with fewer than 50% of the students predicted to graduate from high school on time ( Metro Trend Watch , 2001 ) . Procedures <p> I gathered the data during the first 4 weeks of the spring semester . Testing took approximately 30 to 45 minutes per student . Students were recruited from their social studies classes by their teachers . No students declined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Instruments <p> Psychological preparation to transition was measured using a modified version of the Career Transitions Inventory ( CTI ; Heppner , 1991 ) . The original version of this instrument is a self-report inventory designed to measure adults ' perceived preparation to make a career transition . The modified version ( which was adapted by me and two Ph.D . students ) is a self-report inventory designed to measure middle school students ' perceived psychological preparation to transition into high school . Once the modified version was developed , Heppner reviewed it to verify that the items measured constructs equivalent to the original version , and changes were made in the new instrument as per her suggestions . The modified version has a Flesh-Kincaid grade level of 6 . The 40 items of the modified inventory are rated on a 6-point Likert scale ( 1 = strongly agree , 6 = strongly disagree ) . Twenty-two items are reverse scored . Sample statistics for all scales used in this research are reported in Table 1 . <p> Five scales made up the original instrument : Readiness , Confidence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current sample , a confirmatory factor analysis revealed this same five-factor structure in the data using the modified version ( with the absolute values of the standardized path coefficients ranging from .17 to .73 p &lt; .05 for all variables , and adequate goodness-of-fit measures RFI = .81 , IFI = .86 , TLI = .84 , with values closer to 1 indicating greater fit ; Bollen , 2002 ) . A second confirmatory analysis revealed an additional two-factor structure in the data ( Readiness/Confidence/ Support RCS and Control/Independence CI ) with absolute values of the standardized path coefficients ranging from .13 to .46 ( p &lt; .05 ) , and adequate goodness-of-fit measures RFI = .97 , IFI = 1.00 , TLI = .99 , with values closer to 1 indicating greater fit , Bollen ) . Because goodness of fit was greater for the two-factor solution than for the five-factor solution , the two-factor solution was chosen . Thus , two scales ( to represent the two factors in this solution ) were constructed to be used in subsequent analyses of the data . These scales were constructed using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scale measures adolescents ' expectations that they are ready , willing , confident , committed , and have the support to go to high school and to adjust to high school . A sample item is " Going to high school may be too complex a process for me to work through " ( reverse scored ) . The CI scale measures the extent to which adolescents expect that their own efforts , creativity , capabilities , and personal choices will positively affect their educational outcomes . A sample item is " Luck and chance will play the major role in my successfully making it through high school " ( reverse scored ) . <p> Construct validity of the modified CTI was tested in a subset of the current sample ( n = 68 ) . Results showed that the RCS scale correlated negatively with a measure of anxiety ( math anxiety r = - .47 , p &lt; .001 as measured by the Fennema-Sherman Math Attitudes Scale FSMA ; Fennema &; Sherman , 1976 ) and positively with several other measures of educational and career support ( mother support for math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for math r = .45 , p &lt; .001 as measured by the FSMA ; and emotional support for career development r = .32 , p &lt; .01 and instrumental support for career development r = .29 , p &lt; .05 as measured by the Structured Career Development Inventory SCDI ; Lapan , 2004 ) . The RCS scale also correlated positively with academic achievement ( r = .32 , p &lt; .01 ) , as measured by the SCDI . The CI scale correlated positively with Rotter 's ( 1966 ) Internal/External Locus of Control Scale ( r = .35 , p &lt; .05 ) and with the number of hours worked at a job per week ( r = .31 , p &lt; .05 ) . <p> Career development skills was measured using the Missouri Comprehensive Guidance Survey ( MCGS ; Gysbers , Multon , Lapan , &; Lukin , 1992 ) . This instrument measures adolescents ' confidence that they possess career development skills . The MCGS instrument consists of three scales , each scored on a 7-point Likert scale ( 1 = low confidence , 7 = @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The MCGS was originally normed on 3,271 middle school students ( Lapan , Gysbers , Multon , &; Pike , 1997 ) . Constructs represented by the three scales in this instrument have been positively associated with vocational identity , career decidedness , and academic and nonacademic indexes of self-concept , and negatively associated with more referrals to the principal 's office and lower expectations for achieving life goals ( Lapan et al. , 1993 ; Multon &; Lapan , 1995 ) . Internal consistency estimates for the MCGS scale scores in this original sample ranged from .71 to .88 . <p> Career planning and exploration efficacy was measured using the 10-item Career Planning and Exploration Efficacy Scale . A sample item is " I am confident that I know how to explore careers in which I may be interested . " The confidence to relate to others in career and academic contexts was measured using the 31-item Understanding of Self and Others Self-Efficacy Scale . A sample item is " I am confident that I respect other people even though they may be different than me . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measured using the 20-item Educational and Vocational Development Self-Efficacy Scale . A sample item is " I am confident that I know how academic skills , such as math , reading , and science , relate to my career goals . " <p> Parental assistance was measured using the Career-Related Parent Support Scale ( CRPSS ; Turner et al. , 2003 ) . The CRPSS consists of four scales that measure parents ' instrumental assistance , verbal encouragement , emotional support , and career-related role modeling . Each of these scales is scored on a 5-point Likert scale ( 1 = strongly disagree , 3 = neither agree or disagree , 5 = strongly agree ) , with higher scores indicating more agreement . Internal consistency estimates for the CRPSS scale scores in the original norming sample ranged from .78 to .85 ( Turner et al . ) . Constructs underlying the four scales in the CRPSS have been positively associated with career decision-making self-efficacy and career decision-making outcome expectations ( Turner et al . ) . <p> The Instrumental Assistance Scale is a 7-item scale that measures parents ' assistance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sample item is " My parents help me pick out classes that will help me in nay career . " The Verbal Encouragement Scale is a 6-item scale that measures parents ' encouragement of their adolescents ' persistence regarding educational and vocational development . A sample item is " My parents told me they expect me to finish school . " The Emotional Support Scale is a 7-item measure of parental assistance and encouragement regarding educational and vocational issues . A sample item is " My parents talk to me when I am worried about my future career . " The Career-Related Modeling Scale is a 7-item measure of the extent to which parents demonstrate skills and describe circumstances that lead to successful educational and vocational development . A sample item is " My parents have taken me to their work . " <p> Academic preparation and social/environmental barriers were measured using the Perceptions of Barriers Scale ( POB ; McWhirter , 1997 ) . The POB is a 28-item inventory rated on three 4-point Likert scales : a measure of the perceived likelihood that adolescents will experience specified barriers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4 = definitely not a barrier ) ; a measure of the perceived magnitude of these barriers ( 1 = a very big barrier , 4 = not a huge barrier ) ; and a measure of the perceived difficulty of overcoming these barriers ( 1 = definitely difficult , 4 = not difficult at all ) . Barriers as measured by the POB have been related to gender-role attitudes , educational plans , and career expectations among Mexican American and European American boys and girls ( McWhirter et al. , 1998 ) . <p> In order to determine the most relevant factors of the POB in this present sample , an exploratory factor analysis , with a Varimax rotation , was conducted , using the summed ratings for each of the POB items . Ten factors emerged , with eigenvalues &gt; 1 , accounting for 75.72% of the total variance explained . Each of the item ratings loaded at &gt; .40 on their respective factors . Thus , no item ratings were deleted from further analysis . The factors that emerged were ( a ) lack of academic preparation ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ) , ( b ) lack of significant adult encouragement ( 2 items , e.g. , " teachers do n't support nay plans " ) , ( c ) lack of peer encouragement ( 3 items , e.g. , " friends do n't support my plans " ) , ( d ) self-perceived lack of ability , ( 3 items , e.g. , " not talented enough " ) , ( e ) self-perceived lack of motivation ( 2 items , e.g. , " lack of motivation " ) , ( f ) teenage pregnancy ( 2 items , e.g. , " having children " ) , ( g ) family responsibilities ( 3 items , e.g. , " having to work while going to school " ) , ( h ) gender and ethnic discrimination ( 3 items , e.g. , " racial/ethnic discrimination " ) , ( i ) leaving home ( 3 items , e.g. , " not wanting to move away " ) , and ( j ) lack of money ( 3 items , e.g. , " not enough money " ) . The items @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ academic preparation , were scaled , and mean scores for each scale were computed . To aid in interpreting the results of this investigation , items representing lack of academic achievement were reverse scored before they were scaled to reflect no lack of academic preparation . <p> Gender was included as a status variable in this analysis to detect gender differences in adolescents ' responses . Boys were coded 1 , and girls were coded 2 . RESULTS <p> Structural equation modeling ( SEM ) , using maximum likelihood analysis , was used to explore relationships among the variables . As reported in Table 1 , the testable statistical assumptions underlying SEM were met ( i.e. , continuous , nontruncated variables ; normal distribution of data ; and low measurement error ) . Goodness-of-fit measures indicated an adequate fit of the model to the data : CMINDF = 2.19 , RMSEA = .090 , IFI = .98 , and TLI = .97 . For CMINDF , values in the range of 2 to 3 indicate an adequate fit of the model to the data ( Jreskog &; Sorbom , 1993 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit ( Browne &; Cudeck , 1992 ) ; and for IFI and TLI , values very close to 1 indicate a good fit ( Bollen , 2002 ) . Figure 1 shows the relationships between the indicators and the criterion variables . In order to facilitate the interpretation of this figure , only significant paths ( p &lt; .05 ) are shown . Correlations , covariances , and the full path model are available upon request . Beta weights ( signified by the symbol ) , as shown in Figure 1 and in the text following , denote the magnitude of relationships between the predictor and the criterion variables , with larger absolute values indicating stronger relationships . **28;295;TOOLONG <p> Academic preparation had the largest positive effect on the adolescents ' RCS scores ( = .42 ) . Parents ' instrumental assistance also had a positive effect ( = .15 ) ; and lack of teacher support ( = - .22 ) , lack of peer support ( = - .39 ) , and teenage pregnancy ( = - .15 ) had negative effects . Gender ( = .31 ) had a positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and overall support to transition into high school than boys . Career development skills efficacy ( for any of the three skills areas measured ) was not significantly related to the RCS scores . Control/Independence <p> Academic preparation had the largest positive effect on the CI scores ( = .45 ) . Career planning and exploration efficacy ( = .19 ) and understanding the links between school and work efficacy ( = .14 ) had positive effects , as did parents ' instrumental assistance ( = .26 ) . Understanding self and others in career and academic contexts efficacy ( = - .36 ) had a negative effect on the CI scores , as did lack of teacher support ( = - .13 ) , lack of peer support ( = - .20 ) , and teenage pregnancy ( = - .15 ) . There were no significant effects of gender on the CI scores , indicating that there were no differences between boys and girls on their sense of personal control and independence . Ethnic Differences <p> Results of a t test with p set to .05 indicated no significant differences between Native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DISCUSSION <p> Results show that academic performance , career development skills efficacy , supports from significant others , and social/environmental barriers are related to inner-city adolescents ' psychological preparation to transition into high school . Among these predictors , academic preparation was most strongly associated with both RCS and CI . Parents ' instrumental assistance was a positive predictor of both RCS and CI ; and lack of peer support and lack of teacher support were both negative predictors . Greater efficacy for career planning and exploration and for understanding the links between school and work was positively related to greater CI , but not to greater RCS . In addition , understanding self and others in career and academic contexts had a negative relationship to adolescents ' perceived CI . <p> Finally , the anticipation of teenage pregnancy was negatively related to both RCS and CI . This finding is consistent with previous research showing that rates of teenage pregnancy among inner-city adolescents are at least 34% above the national mean ( National Research Council , 1993 ) , and it extends those findings by demonstrating that the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' expectations that they can successfully enter into and adjust to high school . <p> Other variables in this study were not significantly related to adolescents ' RCS or CI ( caring for families of origin , the prospect of leaving home , lack of money , and self-perceptions of abilities and motivations did not relate to RCS or CI ) . This suggests that providing interventions to help inner-city adolescents develop skills to overcome these barriers are not as critical to their psychological preparation to transition into high school . Further , there were no significant differences between African American adolescents ' and Native American adolescents ' psychological preparation indicators . This suggests that African American and Native American students from inner-city schools are in equal need of school counseling programs designed to promote their psychological preparation to transition into high school . SUGGESTIONS FOR PRACTICE <p> Although this study was a correlation , results suggest that there are ways that school counselors can increase inner-city adolescents ' psychological preparation to transition into and adjust to high school . These are ( a ) increasing academic preparation by increasing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support through a cohort model of middle school to high school transitioning , ( c ) providing parent and teacher training programs to enhance adolescents ' transitional competencies , ( d ) using work-based learning to increase specified career development skills , and ( e ) providing education and support around adolescents ' expectations of teenage pregnancy . <p> The ASCA National Modelr ( 2005 ) calls for service provision in three areas : academic , personal/ social , and career . Various authors have noted that personal/social and career counseling may be provided to students more often than academic counseling ( Paisley &; Hayes , 2003 ) . The results of this present study suggest that in the inner cities , where many students do not have basic reading , writing , math , or study skills ( Metro Trend Watch , 2001 ) , academic counseling should be increased in order to increase transitional competencies and expectations of transitional success . <p> Cohort transitioning has been used successfully at the college level to increase student retention ( Lucas &; Robinson , 2002 ) . Cohorts can provide adolescents with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger school systems , students often are transferred to man ) , different high schools , and they begin their high school experiences in classes in which they have very few peer supports . I recommend that school counselors advocate for cohort transitioning to high schools in larger inner-city school districts , and that cohort support groups ( in which transitional strategies and plans can be discussed ) be offered both prior to students entering high school and during their first year of high school . <p> Prior to graduation from middle school , counselors can help parents and teachers prepare to assist in their adolescents ' transitioning . Parents and teachers should be helped to understand the psychological preparation , and the psychological consequences , that adolescents can experience during their transition to high school . In addition , middle school counselors can help parents increase their adolescents ' expected transitional competencies as they increase their instrumental assistance ( such as structuring homework times and providing opportunities for educational and career-related skills development ) . <p> Many states allow young adolescents to work part-time jobs as part of their school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and understand how their education is related to work . School counselors can work with students to help them choose the work-based learning experience that would most benefit them , and counselors can offer career exploration groups to help students discuss what they are learning and how their experiences can relate to their later careers . <p> Finally , the results of this study suggest that school counselors can assist inner-city middle school students in examining and discussing the meaning of teenage pregnancy , the risks of teenage pregnancy , and strategies to avoid teenage pregnancy in order to help them make more informed choices . Structured experiences , such as group counseling dealing with teenage pregnancy and parenthood , should be provided . As well , attention should be given to individual students who are struggling to cope with the demands of teenage parenthood as well as the demands of finishing middle school and high school . <p> The overall results of this study suggest that school counselors can help prepare inner-city middle school adolescents to successfully transition into and adjust to high school through providing services in the areas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and specific help in relevant problem areas , such as becoming a teenage parent . Helping adolescents to increase their academic preparation for high school , and to build positive , healthy , and productive support systems with peers , parents , and other adults , can be important ways to promote the success and retention of inner-city students at risk for academic failure . LIMITATIONS AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH <p> A limitation of this research is that all variables were self-report . Further research could examine relationships among adolescents ' psychological preparations to transition into high school , and what is observed , such as post-transition grade retention , graduation , and psychological adjustment . Another limitation is that structured equation modeling is correlational research , which means that although related variables vary together , causation can in no way be implied by these research results .
