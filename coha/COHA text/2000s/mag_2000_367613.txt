My husband and I have kept our wedding vows , but we have n't always played by the popular rules of marriage . We 've gone to bed angry . We 've bickered in front of the children . And we ca n't seem to swing the recommended monthly night out . So what keeps us together ? Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band . I exaggerate  --  but not much . Every couple needs a shared passion that does n't involve their kids . For my parents , it 's gardening . For our close friends , it 's public service . For us , it 's Springsteen . <P> Bruce does n't know it , but his music  --  tender ballads , angry anthems , rowdy dance tunes  --  has sustained us through 17 years of road trips . Jersey Girl was the first song at our wedding . We played Born to Run on the way to the hospital to have our first child . And The Ties That Bind has never failed us . With Bruce still outdoing himself at 50 , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and beyond . <P> I 'm not ashamed to say that we traffic in concert tickets , tapes and T shirts . Over our children 's protests , we play all Bruce , all the time  --  Backstreet Boys be damned . And while we loathe Ticketmaster for never letting us buy truly great seats , we 're still hoping to get MIB 'd ( the legendary " Men in Black " roam the arena an hour or two before each show , upgrading early arrivals from nosebleed sections to the front row ) . <P> Not long ago , my husband got me a subscription to the Bruce forum at
