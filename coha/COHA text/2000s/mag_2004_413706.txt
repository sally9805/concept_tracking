When bread , pasta and even ketchup cause nothing but trouble Photograph // For as long as she could remember , Lesa Abrams had suffered from a delicate stomach . But when the New York City book editor got violendy ill after eating a frozen pizza one February night 4 years ago , she knew she was dealing with no mere bellyache . " I got terrible stomach cramps and basically spent the whole night on the toilet , " recalls the 20-something vegetarian . " The next morning , I kept waiting to feel better , but I never did-not for a long time . " Meals became ordeals . Within 20 minutes of downing so much as a measly muffin , Abrams was hit with intense abdominal pains and bouts of diarrhea so predictable she made sure to eat only within striking distance of a bathroom . Abrams ' gastroenterologist had chalked up her earlier episodes of stomach upset to the stress of an editors demanding job . But when a desperate Abrams showed up in his clinic near the end of March 2000 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests for a little-known , inherited condition called celiac disease , also known as celiac sprue or gluten-sensitive enteropathy . The disease has been considered so rare and so specific to children that Abrams ' doctor was almost certain that his patient did n't have it . A few days later , the physician left the test results on Abrams ' answering machine : " This is so strange . You 've tested positive ! I ca n't believe it ! " A Dire Disease Celiac disease is a form of gluten intolerance-an inability to digest gluten , which is a " gluey " protein that gives cohesiveness to the dough of breads , pasta and other foods that contain wheat , rye or barley . Lesser-known grains such as spelt , kamut and triticale also contain gluten . But celiac disease carries much more dire consequences than the inability to eat bagels . " Simple intolerance produces passing gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and sometimes vomiting , but with no lasting ill health effects , " says Michelle Pietzak , MD , a pediatrie gastroenterologist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , celiac is " an autoimmune disorder , like type I diabetes , so it puts people at a lifetime risk for a range of serious illnesses including anemia , osteopotosis , even cancer . " Celiac can increase a persons risk for these illnesses , says Pietzak , because the immune system reacts against gluten in the intestines , eventually damaging the wall of the small intestine so that it ca n't fully absorb the vitamins and other nutrients vital to good health . Gluten can even affect die brain , causing depression , seizures , schizophrenia and other neurologic and psychiatric problems . Doctors often make an inaccurate diagnosis because they 've been taught to regard celiac disease as a rare childhood condition that produces only gastrointestinal symptoms . But as a recent survey published in the February 10 , 2003 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine shows , celiac disease is neither confined to children nor distinguished only by stomach upset alone . Signs of celiac disease include constant fatigue , bone or joint pain , frequent fractures and weight loss . " In healthy populations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 of every 132 Americans . In families with a history of the disease , die prevalence is as high as 1 in every 22 people , " says Pietzak , die study 's co-author. // Where 's the Gluten ? // The Gold Standard of Diagnosis The initial screening for celiac disease is a series of blood tests known as the Celiac Blood Panel . A positive test shows high levels for three gluten antibodies : antigliadin IgG and IgA ( AGA ) , anti-endomysial IgA ( EMA ) and anti-tissue transglutaminase IgA ( tTG ) antibodies . Those same tests offered Selena Eon , a 26-year-old naturopathic medical student from Seattle , an answer to what lurked behind the stomach pain that had plagued her for the better part of a decade . By the end of 1999 , Eon was so sick that she would lie on the floor , hold her stomach , cry in pain and then run to the bathroom after she ate anything . Physical exams and standard blood tests turned up nothing . Eventually , her father-a naturopathic doctor-ordered a comprehensive GI panel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private clinic . The results convinced Eon she had celiac disease . Celiac specialists , however , recommend following up positive blood tests with a biopsy of the lining of the small intestine to check for damage to die intestinal wall . The final piece of die gold standard of diagnosis was Eon 's return to good health after she followed the only known treatment for the disease : eliminating all gluten from her diet . " Gluten is n't an essential nutrient , so you can live safely without it , " says Pietzak . Untreated celiac disease does take a toll on a body , so Pietzak recommends that the newly diagnosed also be tested for vitamin and iron deficiencies and osteoporosis . Wonderful Diagnosis ? Doctors often call celiac a " wonderful diagnosis " because the disease is controlled by diet alone . Patients show a lot less enthusiasm . " At first , I cried whenever I started thinking about the pizzas I 'd never eat again , the poppy seed muffins . It was like losing a love , " admits Abrams . Even home cooking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eon is so sensitive to gluten that , before making a meal , she has to wipe down the kitchen counter after her wheat-eating husband and son have been cooking . It took Eon a good year before she came to terms with her condition . " At first I laid in bed and cried a lot , " she recalls . " Then one day I decided to get over it and find all the foods I could eat-and then learn how to be a good cook . " The pickings , Eon found , were more plentiful than she 'd imagined . " In the past few years , there 's been an explosion in the number of foods , cookbook and resources available to people with celiac disease , " says Carol Fenster , PhD , author of Gluten-Free 101 and president of Savory Palate , a Colorado-based company that publishes books on food intolerance and counsels gluten-free patients . Most health food stores and a growing number of mainstream supermarkets stock gluten-free " wheat " staples : breads made from rice flours , corn and potato starch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rice breakfast Os . These stores may also carry millet and other exotic grains such as quinoa , amaranth and teff which can fill in for wheaty foods and offer a higher number of nutrients . Abrams primarily cooks meals with the gluten-free standards of the vegetarian 's diet : fruits , vegetables and legumes . A current favorite : spinach , chickpeas and tomato sauce served over rice pasta . For comfort food , it 's still pizza she longs for-and pursues . " There 's a restaurant out on Long Island that makes a gluten-free pizza , and I have no problem driving out there when the urge hits .
