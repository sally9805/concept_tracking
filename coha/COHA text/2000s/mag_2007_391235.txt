LETTER OF THE MONTH THE EYE OF THE MARMOT , THE THRILL OF THE FIGHT Thanks for September 's Gear Guide issue and getting me all revved up for the season . I can honestly say that Skiing is the only magazine I read cover to cover . I have a soft spot for the marmots in First Tracks and read that first . The mag got me so excited that , for the first time in my life , I developed a full-blown workout plan to get in shape for the season . To start , I began hiking to get my quads ready . On my very first hike , I found a marmot waiting for me near the top of the mountain . It was moving its mouth like it was trying to say something . I 'm not sure if I believe in destiny , but my first marmot experience has convinced me that this is going to be an epic ski season . Brian LaComb Westminster , Colorado We 're glad to hear the marmot has inspired you to get after it this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for actually reading the entire mag ( we thought only our moms did that ) , we 're giving you these Vlkl Bridges with a custom Skiing mag top sheet and Marker Jester bindings . They 're good for ripping the front side , shredding pow , and outrunning rabid marmots.  --  Ed . FAT I 'm still waiting for the first snowfall . But relief comes every September with your Gear Guide . Living two hours away from most Utah resorts , I now know which fatties will float Alta , which skis will rip Deer Valley 's front side , and which boards are best suited for Snowbasin 's glades . Thanks for another great review . Jake Bullinger Mountain View , Wyoming FATTER I enjoy the September Skiing Gear Guide and always look for some big-boy ski testers , since I myself tip the scales at 250-plus pounds . Last year I noticed your beloved editor-in-chief Marc Peruzzi was listed at 4 ' ' 11 " and 350 pounds , and this year he was listed at a nonsensical 6 ' ' 12 " , 329 pounds . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found him listed at 5 ' ' 2 " , 320 pounds . I recently saw a picture of him and he sure do n't weigh 300 pounds soaking wet . What gives with this obviously intended annual misprint ? Kyle Sandwith Via the Internet Misprint ? Sadly , no . Much like Andre the Giant and Fantasy Island 's Herv Villechaize , Marc Peruzzi suffers from a rare glandular disorder that causes Oprah-esque weight fluctuation . You should see him today . He 's 3 ' ' 9 " and wearing a lovely , supportive man-bra.  --  Ed . CLEVELAND , STEAMED So I 'm sitting there in my favorite reading place enjoying the September Gear Guide issue , when I stumble upon this line : " After all , only the residents of Cleveland like to read about losers . " Where the hell did that come from ? Do n't you think it 's hard enough just being a Browns fan in the first place without having to endure cheap shots from you ? You should appreciate that being a Browns fan is like being a skier . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it does n't have to make sense . So spare me your unsolicited commentary about my city and my team and stick to my other obsession  --  the one that you know best . Dave Herrington Lake Villa , Illinois Skiing associate editor and fourth-generation Clevelander Scott Gornall responds : I 'm with you , Dave . My boss , the hypothyroid editor-in-chief Marc Peruzzi , added that line as a dig against my team . Being a Browns fan , I plan on smashing a beer bottle in his Masshole face . Then I plan on being fired . Stupid sexy Tom Brady . BOX E-mail letters to editor@skiingmag.com . Go to SKINET.COM/CONTESTRULES for the official Letter of the Month contest rules .

The technical answer is jack squat , or slightly more than you earn watching them . " Basically , they get paid by their sponsors , " says Steve Winter , president of Crested Butte 's Matchstick Productions . Since the advent of freeride teams in the last decade , many pros now tend to receive annual cash retainers from their various sponsors on the explicit understanding that they will do their utmost to ski brilliantly at the slightest glimpse of a tripod . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You show up in a ski film  --  a process that starts by impressing guys like Steve Winter either in person or via demo reel . " We try to get guys when they 're coming up , " says Winter . " In a way , we 'll act as agents , find them sponsors , and make sure they sign good contracts . " MSP 's casting couch , however , is another matter entirely . IF EUROPE IS SO PROGRESSIVE , HOW COME THEIR SKI-AREA TOILETS ARE SO MANKY ? Hey , cut the fatherland some slack . After World War II left Europe with crumbling infrastructure and kleptocratic economic policies , toilets were low on the priority list . It was n't that far back when a Euro john was nothing more than a hole with footrests . And what 's with the double standard ? There 's no rule that Chamonix 's salles de bains should be any tidier than , say , a Wyoming truck stop .
