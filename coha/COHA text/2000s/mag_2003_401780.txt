FOUR FORWARD SOMERSAULTS ON A BMX BIKE ? MAYBE IF THE ROOF HAD BEEN A LITTLE HIGHER AND THE TRAMPOLINE 'S LEGS A LITTLE STRONGER .... FICTION BY GARY PAULSEN middot ILLUSTRATIONS BY MICHAEL WEAVER // I have it this time . The absolutely perfect idea .... " Henry Mosley held up a legal pad covered with calculations . Usually he kept his ideas in three-ring binders-he had two shelves of idea binders at home-but frequently he did the rough work on large yellow legal pads before transferring them to the binders . It was , Henry told his friends , for neatness . A neat mind did a neat job and a neat job thusly made for a neat mind . He actually used the word when he told them . Thusly . But they liked him anyway . " What idea ? " Bill Dolen looked cautious and downright skeptical . He and Rick Hamner were best friends with Henry , and after the last disaster with one of Henry 's ideas-in which they were acting out a book and tried to live for four days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elephant , a tiger and a chocolate-loving hyena loose from a circus train-Bill had decided they were extremely lucky to have all reached the ripe old age of 12 . " The new idea for our annual project . It 's been almost a year since our last one .... " " Has it really been that long ? " Rick frowned . " The scabs are hardly gone and my scars are still kind of purple .... " " Eleven months and 19 days , " Henry said . " We are ready for the next one . " " Well , I do n't know if you could actually say we 're ready for the next one . " Bill sighed . " I mean , you know , ready is such a big word . I think maybe you should tell us what book you 're thinking of doing before we figure out if we 're ready . " It was their continuing hobby/project . For years , once a year , they would take a book and study it and try to live out part or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting summers , and if you did n't count the pain or property damage , it usually turned out fairly educational . " No book . " Henry shook his head . " We 're trying something new this year . " There was a moment of silence-thoughtful silence on Henry 's part , something close to terrified quiet on the part of Rick and Bill . // Finally Rick opened his mouth , seemed to croak , shuddered and finally got out : " What do you mean , new ? " " Well . " Henry showed them the legal pad , which was covered with lines and formulae and diagrams and notes . " Every year we do the book idea and , sure , it 's fun , but then it 's over and nobody remembers it ... " " I do , " Rick said . " When I look in the mirror and see where the stitches came out ... " " ... And there 's no real record , " Henry went on , ignoring Rick , " except in my notebooks . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it hit me . We have to do something that breaks a record . See ? " More silence . Bill seemed to stare unthinking off into space , although he would later claim that he was thinking of how much he loved his family , even his little sister , even when she cut up his autographed Yankee World Series pennant to make a Barbie dress . Even that sister . // Rick 's silence was more thoughtful , thinking of angles . " You mean a town record ? Or county ? Or state ? " Henry shook his head . " I 'm thinking more in terms of world . A world record . Otherwise nobody will pay any attention to it . " " I was afraid you 'd say that .... " " Wait . Wait . " Bill held up his hands . " Did n't we do that already ? Remember when we got all those dogs from the pound and tried to run the Iditarod sled dog race ? " " No . That was a book thing . Remember ? We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we tried to duplicate it by getting 15 dogs and running 10 miles out around town . " " I know , I know . But we did it in summer so we could n't use a sled and we hooked all 15 dogs to a bicycle . Is n't that a record ? For number of dogs to a bicycle ? Sure . That 's got to be a world record . Even if some of them were poodles and one was a Basenji and that Chihuahua 's feet never really touched the ground , they were still dogs . I 'll bet that 's a record . So we do n't need to do that again . " " I know I do n't need to do it again . " Rick shook his head . " I was the rider and I thought I was going to have to have the bicycle surgically removed from my body . I mean when they took over and went into the back door of Jones 's butcher shop I almost swallowed the bike . " " There , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dogs loose in a butcher shop . A world record , right there . I 'll bet there is n't a place in the world that 's had 15 dogs loose in a butcher shop , fighting over wieners ? Talk about records .... " But he knew . They both knew as soon as Henry shook his head . They knew it was n't the same and they knew they would do what Henry 's plan called for ; they always did what Henry 's plan called for because , in the end , Henry had the best plans . " What , " Rick said with a resigned sigh , " is posterity ? And why do we need to do things for it ? " I 've given it a lot of thought , " Henry said , slipping to the second page of notes on the legal pad . " And frankly , the hard part was deciding just what record to break , or make , since some of the ones I thought about have never been done . " " I probably do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scratching his chin where the scar marked him from the time they did " Treasure Island " and Rick somehow came up with two real , antique cutlasses for a pirate fight scene , " but what are some of the rejects ? " " Forget it , Henry , cut right to the chase , " Rick interrupted . " Which one did you pick ? " " Bikes . BMX bikes . It 's stunts we 're heading for , men . " " Stunts ? But Henry , " Rick opened his eyes , " everybody has a BMX bike and does stunts . How can we make a record with stunts ? " " Just one , " Henry held up a finger . " We are going to break the record with just one stunt Gentlemen , we are going to break the world record with the most forward somersaults on a BMX bike . " There was a moment of what might be called stunned silence . " Exactly , " Henry said . " It 's perfect . I knew you 'd agree . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Henry , I 've watched those big rallies and meets on television . Those guys are good . I mean a lot of them are n't even kids and they 're up there doing back flips and somersaults .... " " One , sometimes two or two and a half with a doppleganger and a whizbanger or whatever they call them . And only backward . Never forward . That 's the key-forward . I 'm talking four complete forward somersaults . " " Oh well , if it 's just four , " Bill said . " I thought it was going to be hard .... " " Who ? " Rick said , sounding very much like an owl . " Who ? Who ? " " Who what ? " Henry asked . " Who does this ? I mean I 'd like to , but I was the one who went up with the hang glider we made out of plastic tarp and I 've been kind of leery of heights ever since , and it seems like somebody will have to get pretty high to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Forty-seven feet , " Henry said , " exactly . I worked it out with a calculator . " " Who ? " This time it was Bill . " That 's over four stories . Who ? " " I figure we draw straws . That way we all get a chance . And the other two will assist . " " Well good then . As long as we 've all got at least a chance . " To live , he added , whispering to himself . And so it was in this way that Rick Hamner pulled the short straw and became the first boy in history to power a BMX bicycle completely through a dumpster .... Of course nothing great is that simple or so quickly or easily done . True , Henry had worked it all out on a calculator , and had things gone the way they looked when he used the calculator Rick might not have hit the dumpster ... but we 're getting ahead of the story . // " It 's this way , " Henry said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they say it ca n't be done . So even if we get one we 've got the record . And if we get four ... well , that 's just gravy . " " Yeah , " Rick said , " Gravy .... " They had gone past Rick 's house and picked up his bicycle and his helmet and were walking along , pushing the bike , heading for a location that Henry had said was the only place they could perform the record-making stunt . " The Batsons ' house , " he said . " They 're away on vacation , and they are the only ones in town with a full-on , professional-size trampoline . " " Trampoline ? " Rick stopped . " Why do we need a trampoline ? " " For altitude , " Henry said , shaking his head . " Is n't that obvious ? " " Is that legal ? " Bill asked . " I looked it up . It does n't say anything about trampolines . Just that you ca n't use a motor . " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a bicycle ? " Rick had stopped . " Of course not , " Henry said , " that would be just silly . This trampoline is located perfectly just under the back edge of the Batsons ' roof . We start there , shoot down the incline , touch-and-go on the trampoline , and this added altitude from the spring should assist you to do four forward somersaults . Or as many as you can get done . Who knows ? You might even get more-six or seven .... " " Roof ? " Rick had n't quite caught up . " You want me to ride off a roof ? " Bill stopped them again . " Maybe this is a dumb question , but do the Batsons know we 're doing this ? " Henry nodded , then changed it to a shrug . " There might be a little fuzzy edge to it , but Mr. Batson told my dad it was all right for us to come over anytime and use the trampoline . I thought it might be best to not bring up the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Wait a minute-you want me to ride off a roof ? " Rick shook his head . " Are we sure about all this ? Are we absolutely positive I got the short straw ? Really , off a roof ? " And the thing is , later , when they were talking about it while cleaning Rick up , they all agreed that it could have worked . They positioned the trampoline just right beneath the roof edge , and by pushing and pulling and convincing and not even having to use a tranquilizer gun ( as Bill pointed out ) they got Rick on top of the Batsons ' roof sitting on his bike , wearing his helmet and some goggles Henry had brought in a bag with some Band-Aids ( Henry always believed in being prepared ) . " Are you ready ? " Henry asked . " No . Not really . It 's a long way down to that trampo .... " " Go ! " Henry was next to him on the roof , and Bill had gone down with a small digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The problem , they all agreed later , was technical ; an equipment failure . Or as Bill decided , " They just do n't make trampolines the way they should .... " With some reluctance Rick started when Henry yelled , and by the time he hit the bottom edge of the roof he was moving at something near terminal velocity . And further , he hit the trampoline exactly right , perfectly in the center . The problem was in engineering and force of thrust . No trampoline in the world could stand the load of a boy and bike hitting it at terminal velocity , and as Rick and the bike stretched it down and down and farther down until it just brushed the ground , the sideways motion of the bike coming off the roof directed the force of thrust against the two off-legs of the four-legged trampoline and with a cracking sound they collapsed , dropping the down-thrust side of the trampoline to the ground . At this precise second , all the stored energy in the trampoline let go and snap-propelled Rick and the bike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " About , " Bill said thoughtfully later , " like someone flicking a booger off a finger . " ) But because the legs had collapsed and lowered the angle of the trampoline to the side , instead of going back up Rick shot out sideways at an angle aimed at the alley . It was nearly 40 feet to the dumpster , and Bill later swore Rick never touched the ground . He had forgotten to turn on the video camera so there was no visible evidence and they could n't be sure . What they did know was Rick and the bicycle hit the dumpster at probably 60 miles an hour . The trash company had just recently gone over to plastic instead of steel dumpsters and Rick impacted with almost planned precision near a small crack the truck had made in the side , slammed through the plastic , which broke handily , blew through two plastic bags apparently ( as near as they could figure ) almost completely full of banana peels , coffee grounds and used paper diapers , was deflected slightly up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shower of diapers , peelings and coffee grounds whereupon he described a classic parabolic projectile curve , did one full and complete , perfect , forward somersault , came to rest sitting against a fence with his eyes still closed ( as they had been all along ) , a paper diaper pulled down over his head and in a voice muffled by the diaper and its contents said : " Man , I 'm glad I was wearing a helmet That would have been soooo bad without a helmet . " I do n't think they 're going to allow the record . " Henry shook his head . " I sent the BMX association a letter saying we , that is you , held the record for the first forward somersault , the first trip through a dumpster , the first use of a trampoline , the first of all the above blindfolded ... " " Blindfolded ? " Bill asked . " He had a diaper over his head full of .... " " Same as blindfolded . I did n't mention that it was a diaper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I dream about them . " Rick sat on the edge of the porch , staring off into space . " I mean it 's been two weeks now and the twitching is gone and I do n't spit all the time anymore , but you know , I still dream about them . " " About what ? " " Diapers . " Rick sighed . " They 're full of coffee grounds and something I do n't want to talk about and I wake up sweating ... they 're not nice dreams . " " I figured they probably did n't like the trampoline , " Henry went on as if he had n't heard Rick . " But there 's nothing in the rules about using balloons . " " Balloons ? " Bill 's ears perked up . " Sure . I figure we get about 30 or 40 of those big helium-filled Valentine balloons and tie them to a bike and let it drift out over Henderson 's Lake , you know , so there 's something soft to land in , and then cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he was , as sometimes happened , talking to himself . <p>
