<p> You want Olympic legacy , Atlanta style ? Then visit developer Chris Schoen 's ninth-floor office overlooking the Downtown Connector and Georgia Aquarium . <p> Schoen gushed as he pointed to cranes and construction below . The nine square blocks slated for rebirth sit just northeast of Centennial Olympic Park , Atlanta 's central gathering place created for the 1996 Olympic Games . <p> " This is the largest single redevelopment in an American downtown that we 're aware of , " the Barry Real Estate CEO said of the plans for Ivan Allen Plaza . " This is the most visible site in the Southeast . " <p> The plans are , naturally , grand . Schoen said the site will include a " super high-end restaurant , " the " highest-quality hotel downtown " and " major , major residential properties . " <p> The verbiage was pure Billyspeak , as in Billy Payne , the larger-than-life bid organizer who billed the Atlanta Games as " the greatest peacetime event in the history of the world . " <p> Whether the Atlanta Games measured up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to debate . Still the decade mark is a natural time to consider what was left in the Olympian wake . <p> The Olympics spurred a period of growth almost unparalleled in the city 's history . It left a host of venues and created a civic energy that led to international business investment and future development like Allen Plaza . But the dramatic urban renewal that city boosters promised was neither immediate nor widespread . And as time passes , it 's harder to definitively link new downtown development with the Games ' legacy . <p> The most notable Olympic leftovers are Centennial Olympic Park , Turner Field and the Olympic dormitories , which were turned over to Georgia State University . The dorms allowed the school to start erasing its image as a commuter college and become a player in downtown development . <p> The legacy encompasses not just what remains , but also what does n't . <p> Techwood Homes , the housing project just south of Georgia Tech and north of the future Centennial Park , was razed before the Olympics and replaced afterward with Centennial Place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lived in Techwood for 20 years , now lives in a garden apartment in Centennial Place . " It 's nice , safe and decent , " she said . " It gives people a new look on life . " <p> Some venues struggle <p> Yet everything the Games touched has not turned to gold . Promoters at the 6,200-seat beach volleyball stadium in Clayton County and the 8,000-seat tennis venue at Stone Mountain have had difficulties putting bodies in those chairs . And the $18 million shooting venue in south Fulton County lost money after the Games and was shut down . <p> Olympic organizers have long explained that the $1.7 billion it cost to build venues and run the Games was privately raised by the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games and a gift to the area . <p> Total government spending on the Games is hard to estimate . The federal government spent more than $200 million renovating Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and $42 million replacing Techwood . The state spent tens of millions on the World Congress Center and athletes ' dorms . Bridges , streets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Games but most had been planned even before the Olympics were a gleam in Payne 's eye . <p> By comparison , Barcelona , Spain , host of the 1992 Summer Games , spent about $9 billion  --  most of it government money  --  to get ready for the Olympics . It expanded its freeway system and converted an industrial zone into a residential district with high-rises and beaches . <p> Although Georgians spent much less on the Olympics here , a University of Georgia study estimated the event added $5.1 billion to the state 's economy . But such conclusions can be hard to substantiate because such studies measure not only direct economic impact but also the multiplier effects of those dollars . <p> Olympic organizer and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young believes the impact was greater than that . He contends the Olympics kept Atlanta 's growth machine humming during the economic downturn of the early 1990s and spurred spinoff investment in the city . <p> " If it had n't been for the Olympics , we would n't have the 17th Street Bridge and Atlantic Station , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real place to see <p> But , despite the Olympian reach , when out-of-town visitors ask where to go to view the Remains of the Games , it 's hard to point them to a place that evokes the Olympics other than Centennial Park  --  and now the Atlanta History Center , which opened its Olympic wing Saturday . <p> " My first impression from 10 years later is we did n't get as much out of it as we could have or should have , " said Richard Padgett , president of the Downtown Development Authority from 1991 to 1994 . " It paralyzed everything else in the city . We forgot about infrastructure . We forgot about sewers . It stalled some pioneering efforts near downtown . We got dazzled by the lights . " <p> The expectations of the post-Olympic benefits , fed by pre-Olympic euphoria , were hard to live up to . <p> In 1993 , Clara Axam succeeded now-Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin as the head of the Corporation for Olympic Development , an organization that oversaw public improvements funded by private and public money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wish list of sidewalk improvements , street re-redesigns , pocket parks and plazas . <p> " I stopped counting at $500 million , " Axam recalls . <p> Her agency ended up spending $76 million . <p> Atlanta was awarded the Olympics in 1990 , giving organizers five years and 10 months to pull off a frenzied building spree . " Everything seems to be in the act of being rehabbed , reinvented or reconfigured  --  all at the same time , " USA Today reported as the event loomed . <p> On July 19 , 1996 , the venues were built , the trees planted , the housing erected and Muhammad Ali lit the caldron at the new 80,000-seat Olympic Stadium to kick off the Games . <p> The next year , the 130-foot-tall caldron , likened to a McDonald 's french fry container , was trucked several blocks north so as not to mess up the sight lines of the reconfigured and renamed 47,000-seat Turner Field . <p> Help for home teams <p> Such was the disposability  --  and practicality  --  of the Games . The $3 million cycling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quebec . The $24 million open-air natatorium , the Games ' architectural star , was enclosed and expanded for Georgia Tech students to use as a recreation center . <p> Turner Field , which cost a total of $242 million , none borne by taxpayers , is credited with keeping the Braves from heading to the suburbs . The Olympic effort helped push through financing to build the Georgia Dome . The dome later spurred construction of Philips Arena . <p> These improvements allowed Atlanta to hang on to its pro football and basketball teams , and lure a hockey team . The Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce now optimistically calls the city The Sports Capital of the World . <p> Probably the most visible Olympic legacy is the 21-acre Centennial Olympic Park , the largest urban green space created in the United States in 25 years . <p> Before 1996 , it was a maze of blighted buildings in CNN 's front yard . Payne looked down from his office on the derelict property and saw its potential to save Atlanta from the embarrassment of playing host to the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became Atlanta 's family room during the 17 days of the Olympics and later the centerpiece of downtown renewal , a place where children dance in the water fountains , office workers stroll during lunch and crowds mingle for nighttime concerts . <p> It achieved what the downtown mall , Underground Atlanta , always has dreamed of doing  --  bringing suburbanites to the city 's center . <p> Once downtown , many people stayed . Payne said 30,000 new residents live downtown , a number that has been mentioned often by downtown boosters . <p> " There was never any doubt this would be the center of downtown growth , " said Payne . " But we have n't transitioned to a fully residential format yet . " <p> The 30,000 figure comes from a study of the number of new residents since 1990 living within a mile of the intersection of Peachtree and Ellis streets , said A.J. Robinson , president of Central Atlanta Progress . While the number takes a somewhat expansive view of downtown , Central Atlanta officials say 7,000 more housing units are planned in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around the park did not come at the expected breakneck speed , however . Marietta Street and the Fairlie-Poplar area still are awaiting commercial development , and a planned nightlife and entertainment district near the CNN Center never materialized . <p> Robinson attributes the delayed post-Olympic growth around the park to a collective " psychic fatigue . " He also points to poor city leadership under former Mayor Bill Campbell . <p> Payne attributes the construction lag to landowners ' overexuberance . <p> " People 's expectations of how they 'd profit became exacerbated after the Olympics , " Payne said . Before big projects could begin rolling in , land prices had to return to reality , he said . And developers waited to see if this latest round of downtown renaissance would really happen . <p> The placement of the Georgia Aquarium just north of Centennial Park signified that the west side of downtown was ready to take off . That event , however , was happenstance . Aquarium financier Bernie Marcus originally announced , in 2001 , that the facility would be built in the new Atlantic Station @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near the park . Coca-Cola , the owner of that land , is now moving the World of Coca-Cola next door to the wildly successful aquarium . <p> Gains come at expense <p> But development is a game of winners and losers . <p> " Centennial Park is becoming the nexus for exciting development , but it will be drawing away from Underground and Five Points , " said Charles Rutheiser , a former urban anthropology professor at Georgia State . " When development takes place , it happens at the expense of other areas . " <p> Peachtree Street is losing tenants to new development elsewhere downtown . Underground Atlanta , which continually tries to reinvent itself , is losing its popular World of Coke neighbor . And the Five Points plaza , a magnet for loiterers , has n't changed much . <p> Maybe the Olympics momentum should have been used to help struggling neighborhoods more , said Rutheiser , who wrote a book " Imagineering Atlanta , " about the city 's preparation for the Games . But the Olympics were n't meant to be a cure-all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sustained or directed effort to help develop the poorer neighborhoods around downtown , " said Rutheiser . " But this was n't an anti-poverty effort ; it was a business venture . " <p> Perhaps the best hope for those languishing downtown areas comes from Georgia State University . GSU President Carl Patton is eternally grateful for the 2,000-bed dorm built along I-75 for the Olympic Village , then deeded over to the university . <p> Though he is trying to sell those dorms , which are nearly two miles from campus , the university 's construction of more housing and facilities on the east side of downtown is creating a building buzz . <p> " We had no housing before the Olympics , and this changed the character of the university , " said Patton , who is quick to point out GSU paid off the housing bonds . <p> But Patton , a downtown booster who lives in a condo facing Centennial Park , said it 's important to keep things in perspective : A lot of intown development would have happened with or without the big 1996 sporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate and the Olympics changed everything , " Patton said .
