Every politician knows to kiss a baby , but most avoid holding one for very long to escape blame for the inevitable burst of tears . Last Wednesday , after the President graciously accepted the hand-off of Representative Gregory Meeks ' rambunctious one-year-old , instantly captivating her with a hybrid game of patty-cake and applause on cue , he seamlessly delivered the rationale for continuing what he had started in near perfect political , historical and emotional pitch . " It takes a long time to turn a country around , " he said , after ticking off the achievements of his Administration , and noted , " This is the chance of a lifetime to build the future of our dreams for our children . " <P> Too bad the venue was a dreary hotel conference room in lower Manhattan , preaching to the saved , and not a battleground state , appealing to the undecided . Too bad Al Gore has put his party 's most potent weapon in a lockbox . Too bad for Democrats there 's a 22nd Amendment that keeps Clinton from running @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a far more lucid rebuttal than Gore  --  and without the sighing . His job-approval rating surpasses Ronald Reagan 's in his final days . <P> At the tail end of a second term , most Presidents are old or otherwise spent . Clinton thinks he 's neither . Sadder for facing the wages of his sin and wiser for having faced down four Congresses , seven budgets and one impeachment , Clinton commands , even from his detractors , a grudging respect .

But Hillary 's embrace of her husband down the stretch may put her in the record books : the first First Lady to abdicate the White House to win a Senate seat from a state she had previously only visited as a tourist . Meanwhile , Gore , who wo n't share a stage with Clinton , finds himself in a dead heat for an office he should take in a walk . The couples were together for the first time since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were the obligatory air kisses and handshakes , followed by awkward efforts to get away from one another as fast as possible . <P> The relationship has never recovered from impeachment . Peter Baker reports in his book The Breach how former deputy chief of staff Harold Ickes approached several Democratic Party leaders about urging the President to resign . Gore 's resistance to such feelers may have saved the country from an even greater trauma , but it deprived him of sailing into the election as an incumbent . And it left him susceptible to attack , as if Monica had delivered that pizza to him . <P> It 's an upside-down world when your Vice President takes your marital infidelity more personally than your wife does . Friends say the Gores were dumbstruck by Clinton 's reckless dalliance . Hillary 's long-standing bargain with her husband might not have sanctioned extramarital affairs , but their life together taught her how to survive them . Tipper , who danced so merrily with Hillary at the ' 92 convention , took to mumbling that Monica was younger than her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
