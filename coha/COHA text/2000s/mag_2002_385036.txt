// From the new Academy Awards theater to the new Mohegan Sun casino to the viewing platform at the World Trade Center site to restaurants , hotels , and hospitals , David Rockwell is the one architect most likely to actually change your life DAVID REACHES OUT AND TOUCHES THINGS . // He wants you to touch them too . See this railing ? How it 's wrapped with leather ? Does n't that feel good ? And those walls of black river pebbles embedded in black ash ? It 's impossible to walk past them without reaching out a hand . Ditto the mahjong-tile wall panels that revolve when you touch them : very cool , pleasing to children of all ages . David also likes it when things glow that are n't supposed to glow , like these other wall panels made out of wood sliced into very thin sheets and glued to glass and lit from behind . The warm wood-light is goofy and friendly and stylish all at the same time , and it makes people look great . That 's David Rockwell in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For one of its latest projects , David 's crew found a company in Italy that has the only machine in the world that can slice onyx into thin sheets , which they glued to load-bearing glass and fashioned into this vast onyx mountain cut in facets the size of doors and lit from within . It cost millions and is cool in the most shameless way , a glowing onyx jewel the size of the Ritz with luxe cocktail lounges on different levels . But David likes craft , too . He likes well-turned wood like these columns with their raked angles and soft edges , so beautifully mitered and dovetailed and especially pleasing because of the way they butt up against metal . It gives you the pleasure of the unexpected , putting familiar things in new contexts . Pleasure , Surprise , Comfort , Entertain , // these are the important words in the book Rizzoli is putting out about him , the carrots he followed out of nowhere to run an eighty-person firm that designed the new Academy Awards theater ( the one with the goofy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) and the billion-dollar Mohegan Sun casino and the new headquarters for advertising firm McCann-Erickson and the new children 's hospital in the Bronx-the guy the City of New York approached to design the viewing platforms for the site of the former World Trade Center . In a field deeply rooted in the glorification of power and still dominated by people who seem to wish life were more like a scale model ( with neat little streets and all the people glued to plastic pedestals ) , David went the other way , learning from Broadway and Las Vegas . When he picks me up at my pitiful little ranch house , he suggests jazzing it up with a portico made out of **28;1418;TOOLONG so it can be filled with fish in the summer and birds in the winter . Bidding for an airport , he sketched a vast aviary between the windows and the planes so the people looking through would see birds and planes flying together . For an American Indian-owned gambling resort , he wanted live deer running through the casino . He wants to make the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But there 's a funny contrast between David and his wild schemes . With his hair flopping over his ears , wearing black jeans and suede slip-ons , he 's rumpled and low-key and steady If you had to guess , you 'd put him down for a civil-rights lawyer or a professional environmentalist , something modest but purposeful . But underneath the modesty is an artist 's drive . When he was in his early twenties and working for a big architecture firm , he stayed up nights designing a little sushi restaurant , so obsessed with every detail that when the chef could n't pay for his fancy lighting scheme , he borrowed money from a friend and paid for it himself-and won a prestigious lighting-design award . Because light is important . // In college he interned with a venerable theatrical-lighting designer and now he ca n't go into a space he 's created without feeling the overwhelming urge to adjust the light levels . In the onyx mountain , there are more than a hundred different dimming circuits . Dimmers are vital . As he walks the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deadline , the executive in the blue suit keeps asking if it really is n't too dark . " You sure this is n't too dark ? " Wrong question . They work hard on this . Fluorescent light sucks , but incandescent is too expensive for an office this size , so they designed fixtures that bounce the fluorescent light off the ceiling and vent it down , and took readings with light meters until they got it as close to incandescent as it was possible to get , which is pretty close . They also avoided lighting the artwork-prints of past McCann-Erickson campaigns-by silkscreening each work onto a mirror so it bounces light through the work . Of course , there 's a whole philosophical level beyond bright and dark and even on or off  --  contrast , sparkle , that 's what 's important . That 's why texture is so critical . You ca n't bounce light off a flat surface . And it almost goes without saying that all this is also an autobiography and a response to life in our times . When he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discussion packed the family into the car and drove to Mexico , giving him a taste for abrupt transitions and transformations that was reinforced when his mother 's work at community theaters introduced him to the fertile darkness of the stage and planted the seed of his core idea , the dream of creating a magic space where anything can happen . That and the tragic early death of both his parents , and three wild older brothers who dragged him to communes and plied him with various ingestibles . So the parities of modernism did not seduce him . When he was at school , new theories were bubbling up : // Naked children have nevered played in our fountains , and I M. Pei will never be happy on Route 66 .

" Photograph Children 's Hospital at Montefiore &gt;&gt;ROCKWELL DECIDED to design this entire Bronx complex from the point of view ofa child . He realized that sometimes a child might be so sick that he relates to the world better through touch or sound than through sight . The final result includes bedside computers , a hands-on lobby that echoes the design of the universe , and an audio feed that carries the sound of the wind on Mars , so that each child will feel like " an explorer on the way to being healed . " // He loved the playful fantasies of Gaudi and Michelangelo 's eccentric Laurentian Library absurdly filled with stairs and the way the trees of Central Park splashed against that magnificent forward line of buildings . There was joy in irrational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way he 's always mentioning the artist who designed this or the team manager in charge of that , the way he loves to bring people in from other disciplines to brainstorm . Under the coffee table , I want something that 's a surprise-grass , water ... Can we have a mirror on the ceiling tilted to reflect the river ? He even schedules his appointments around his infant son 's bath and bed times . " Can we do that meeting at nine , after Sam goes to sleep ? " And he likes taking his cues from reality , evoking a chef 's rural upbringing with that river-rock wall or the movie Tampopo with a noodle-block ceiling . There 's a modesty in this . And yes , you could argue that he 's perhaps a bit too well adapted to change and just another pliable postmodernist // making baubles for the inner children of the rich , like all those fancy young semioticians from Brown University who learned that it was elitist to valorize one textual system over another so they might as well just go out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is deep in a restaurant settee , lit by glowing wood and eating a thirty  --  dollar piece of fish and talking to a real estate tycoon named Ira who wants to build a luxury hotel in TriBeCa , something over-the-top and more like a home than a hotel , fresh and new but also in context with the neighborhood . David wants to use oversized blocks of terra cotta , same stone as the adjacent buildings , only bigger . Much bigger . And maybe a leather entrance . But not a fortress-he wants huge open shutters on the ground floor to bring the inside and outside together . And he seems sincere about this . Even at McCann-Erickson , walking through the unfinished space with the man in the blue suit and the woman in the red suit , he keeps talking about bringing people together , like with these little cafes and these goofy wooden ovoid pods that serve as employee lounges , and the warmth of human craft in the woodwork of the pod and the leather tooling on the reception desk and the way each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't feel like they 're working in a hive . Then you have these big two-story " black boxes " that can be dressed like a theater stage for multiple uses , with bleachers that pull out and big rolls of butcher paper to draw on and flat screens . Like a Rube Goldberg contraption you can change based on your creative needs . Because rigid boxes are rigid boxes and it 's hard to think creatively inside one . And make no mistake , there 's a dollar-cost advantage to good design . Advertising clients these days have all seen the playful Venice Beach offices Frank Gehry designed for ChiatDay , the ones with the giant binoculars , and they want to see if you 've got that youthful creative energy too-nobody wants an advertising agency that looks like an insurance office . Cool is the word he keeps using . This is cool . Is this going to be cool ? // But not so dark , // " These lights are n't focused yet , " David says . And his populist sentiments certainly did n't affect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a display of monitors carrying every McCann advertisement currently playing anywhere in the world , the better to demonstrate the company 's global domination . David calls it the Dr. Strangelove space . But there 's pleasure in that too , a touch of theater , just like the casino-he loves the casino . The day before it opened , he brought a hundred of his friends and coworkers up from New York just to wander the vast place and savor the thousands of details , from the vast bead  --  work panels that weigh two tons each ( handcrafted in India ) to the way the carpets were woven slightly out of focus to give the impression of a deeper weave . // Trivial ? Indulgent ? It does n't seem so when you visit his children 's hospital , where pleasure and surprise and comfort take on a whole different meaning . And do n't we all need a little comfort ? Like this famous old theater group that wants David to redesign its campus , something that will push the envelope of content and form and also provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will bring them all together . There 's not much of a fee involved , but David is dreaming of transformable structures that will facilitate creativity and spontaneity but also ( playing the grown-up once again ) warning them that they 'll need to build something more glamorous to attract donors . He 's as low-key as ever but inside he 's crackling with pleasure , thrilled by the chance to create a space where people will create , another version of his pods and black boxes . And now he 's venturing into the thing itself , first with the set for The Rocky Horror Show , and next the Broadway debut of Hairspray , by John Waters , a kindred spirit who also likes surprise and the unusual and who shares a certain sweet temperament , like the way his heroine never feels fat or ugly no matter how low people treat her . David wants to celebrate the populist innocence of that and Las Vegas and Route 66 and the whole goofy overstuffed roadside Americana of our lives and what better way than making stage curtains out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying up a little ribbon to transform them into a wig ! A wig around the whole stage ! So that right there at the beginning , you can see the same thing in different ways ! And different things in the same way ! And all around it , as our jaded eyes grow wide , a giant headband of glittering hairspray cans ! Glowing from within ! After an opening like that , anything could happen . Feathers could fall from the sky , fins could sprout from lenticular walls . That sound could be hooves charging straight for us , slowing down to give us a ride .
