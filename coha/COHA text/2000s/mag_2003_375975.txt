The American dream may be home ownership , but the American obsession is losing a few pounds . Artificial sweeteners are a big part of that quest : on average , each of us downs more than 20 lbs . of fake sugars a year . That raises two important questions : Are they safe ? And do they help you lose weight ? <P> The safety issue first arose in the ' 60s , when cyclamates were banned as likely carcinogens . Saccharin , which is found in Sweet'n Low , was labeled a possible carcinogen in the early ' 70s and had to carry a warning until 2000 . Products with aspartame ( NutraSweet ) have always been labeled dangerous for people with phenylketonuria , a relatively rare condition . And sucralose ( marketed as Splenda ) bears no warning label at all . <P> How should consumers interpret all this ? Michael Jacobson , director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest , believes there 's no " slam dunk " proof that any of the artificial sweeteners is clearly dangerous or perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far , " he says , " I think that sucralose is safe , that aspartame is probably safe and that serious questions about saccharin remain "  --  though the risk to an individual is very low . <P> Some critics also claim that artificial sweeteners can actually make you fatter by turbocharging your sweet tooth , but that 's folk wisdom with no hard evidence . The real question is whether they do any good . For losing weight , diet soda is better than regular , but water is even better . And pastries made with artificial sweeteners can still be high in calories if they 're high in fat . If you get a Big Mac and fries with that Diet Coke , you 're simply going to get fat at a slightly slower rate . Fake sugar is probably not a terrible thing  --  but it 's not so great for you either .
