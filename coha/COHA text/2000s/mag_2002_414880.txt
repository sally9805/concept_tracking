Section : THE Watercolor PAGE <p> Gesture , intuition , and passion are all experiences that I instill in my work . My paintings are large ; scale is extremely important in emphasizing the big , sweeping movements I use . In some ways , the paintings are an abstraction from nature . They are not descriptive , literal , or narrative , nor do they work as a direct translation . They are visual experiences that go beyond words to create a harmony of feelings . Evoking a sense of mystery , the dark colors are rich , orchestrated , and subtle , like the dim ringing of a bell . <p> When I was at Millersville University in Pennsylvania , studying for a degree in art education , I painted small , abstract landscapes and flowers in watercolor , as well as large , abstract oil paintings . I continued to paint in both media for some time , loving the thick feeling of oil paint and also the flow of watercolor . However , when I was diagnosed with adult asthma and could no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working in oil . I experimented with different watermedia and settled on three  --  watercolor , acrylic , and gesso  --  that I now combine to create single works . <p> Another important realization that helped me discover my unique style occurred at a watercolor workshop I attended , when I was advised to paint on larger paper . Later , someone else commented that my paintings would read better if I worked bigger . That was all I needed for motivation . I started working in a large , elongated format and have used it ever since . The move toward experimentation was reinforced by one of my most important teachers , painter Glenn Bradshaw , who gave me the encouragement and permission to take creative risks . Having learned the fundamentals of art , I was ready to break the rules of traditional watercolor painting . My style evolved , and I found that my interest resided purely in marks and strokes , rather than in their use for representation . I wanted to find new ways to make a mark or line interesting , conveying movement and feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting can appear out of the unknown . To allow it to do so , I start with nothing in mind . Viewing artistic expression as a process of discovery , I find out a lot about myself , and a great deal of my personality becomes embedded in my work . Customary rituals such as stuffing my apron pocket with paper towels or turning on music prepare me to paint . I do n't work to music , but instead , use it as white noise to clear my mind and paint in a Zen-like state . The mood in which I try to work is best articulated by Sam Francis , who said , " Painting is the silent wildfire of Bliss . " <p> It 's difficult to describe the sequential procedure of my paintings because they do n't always start the same way . For the most part , I stand at my table and work on a flat surface , which is a 22 1/2 ? - x- 41 ? piece of Arches double-elephant watercolor paper . To begin , I cover the entire paper with watercolor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painting just by a stroke or two , I am off and running ; I can work for about three hours without a break . Because I like to work wet-in-wet there is very little , if any , fine-tuning after I finish . Making changes later is like adding too much brocade or too much trim ; it disrupts the integrity of the piece . I know the additions are not made in the same feeling ; they are not a product of the original mood . <p> I have n't always used neutral colors . A decade ago , I was very interested in vivid pigments , such as bright oranges , reds , pinks , and blues . But eventually I started adding black to my works , and as they grew darker , I became very intrigued by the effect . My palette usually includes black , raw and burnt umber , and all kinds of gray , my favorites being Davy 's gray and Payne 's gray . The robes of acrylics I use are Winsor &; Newton Finity , Golden , and Liquitex . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as Grumbacher and Holbein . In bottles , I like Liquitex Medium Viscosity Acrylics and Golden Fluid Acrylics , and for gesso , I favor Liquitex Colored Acrylic Gesso . I do n't use any of the mediums available to watercolor and acrylic , except water . I use a lot of paint , and I scrape a lot off . Of the three paints I use , I probably use acrylic the most , but only because the tubes are bigger . Occasionally , I compose a painting  --  about one of every 30  --  in extremely light colors as an experiment . <p> The surface of my paintings ranges from a very fluid state to one that is more tactile . I do not use delicate sable brushes , but 4 ? , 6 ? , or 8 ? bristle brushes . I do n't use washes either , as I find that they create a look that is too pristine for my taste . Instead , I move a volume of paint around the paper , working over the whole surface area simultaneously because I want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the strong thrust of my marks evokes the movement in the painting . My scraping tools are putty knives , palette knives , a shower squeegee , and even tubes of paint . Guided by intuition , I use all my tools to manipulate the surface with fat and thin marks . <p> The business side of being an artist  --  sending out works to competitions , to galleries , and to be framed  --  leaves me with three to four days a week to paint . I create many paintings , but of course , they do n't all come together . During the middle of a session , I can suddenly lose the piece I am working on . I do n't always recognize that I 'm straying from the work , but sometimes  --  and I do n't know why  --  I make a mark that is n't part of the mood and does n't fit the expression I am engaged in , and it ruins the painting . Possibly it 's a matter of focus , because I am certain that when I try to fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Being attuned to what I am saying in a particular painting helps the process ; I know when I have said enough and where to stop naturally . The title is the last thing to come . Improvisation and the discovery of intuitive motion and rhythm play an important role in the evolution of my paintings . They bring out my subject and the aspects of my personality it touches . Red Mark , for example , was inspired by a work I saw during the 1960s at an Abstract Expressionist show at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh . It had a similarly vivid red mark , which I was immediately attracted to , thinking , " How courageous . " Now , 40 years later , the impression it had , which has simmered inside me all this time , surfaces . I am painting all the things that I 've seen that have moved me . <p> I trust my intuition in painting more than I do in any other part of my life . When my painting sings , and the technique that I have created uncovers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's indescribably rewarding . Occasionally , I muse that if someone were to take a group of artists and attempt to match them with their paintings , I would not be matched with mine . The paintings I produce can inspire a sense of awe in me , because I 'm a quiet person and they are so bold . Often , I see strength in my paintings that I had n't realized was in me . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Aerial , 2000 , acrylic , watercolor , and gesso , 22 1/2 x 41 .
