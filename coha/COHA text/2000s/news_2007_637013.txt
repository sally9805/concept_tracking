<p> Barbara Reardon of Marietta is a vegetarian . She 's a runner . She knows to take care of herself . <p> Even so , her " cardiac episode " more than a year ago was enough to land her in the intensive care unit for a few days . This unwelcome change of heart was inherited . <p> " I did everything right , but I have a very acute history of heart disease in my family , " she says . <p> Reardon knew she had high blood pressure , but still , her symptoms came on suddenly , and they seemed minor . She felt " vaguely flu-ish " and " icky . " She felt pressure in her chest and tingling in her hands , and she could n't get comfortable sitting or standing . <p> In fact , half of women who experience a heart attack do n't have any warning symptoms before the actual heart attack , says Dr. Gina Lundberg , a cardiologist and board member of the Metro Atlanta American Heart Association . <p> " It took me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even now I have a hard time believing it , " Reardon says . <p> Heart disease can also be associated with older men , or fried foods , or intense chest pains .

" Almost everything from a cardiovascular standpoint , so many things in the cancer arena , so many things like diabetes would never happen if we just exercised like we should , 30 minutes every day , and ate healthy like we should . " <p> So listen to your heart  --  it might be trying to tell you something . <p> WHAT FACTORS PUT ME AT RISK ? <p> * Age .

So women experiencing a heart attack can have symptoms as vague as " I do n't feel quite right . " " A woman can actually be having these symptoms for several days , and then realize something 's going wrong , " says Rebecca Jolly , a nurse practitioner . " If you think something 's wrong , you need to get it checked out .
