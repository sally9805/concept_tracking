Section : TALL SHIPS &; SALTY DOGS Patrick O'Brian 's briny novels , as teeming with life as a man-of-war , have charmed millions . But his most inventive tale was about himself <p> IT WAS A DELICIOUS DILEMMA . A new book in the series was just out . Did you snap it up at once , have a few hours of pure enjoyment , a brief and lovely time sailing with the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic Wars on the far side of the world , under a fair breeze , in good company with perhaps something by Boccherini on the violin and cello , looking forward to an island landing that might , just might , provide a glimpse of a rare booby  --  or did you postpone the satisfaction , lest you get to the inevitable end of the long chain of adventures too fast ? You must draw out the pleasure of being swept up into yet another splendid sea chase through wind-whipped seas , yet another nicely drawn battle scene of sloops and ships of the line ( those fearsome great war @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet more of that fine-tuned conversation between the two comrades in arms and particular friends , lucky Capt . Jack Aubrey and the surgeon-naturalist-spy Stephen Maturin . <p> For who knew when the aging author would cease and the anticipation of the next novel would be gone forever ? <p> Those conflicting emotions must have struck many thousands of readers in the 1990s , when enthusiasm for Patrick O'Brian 's saga surged and astonished the reading public and the publishing world . You may fairly call it the O'Brian craze . More than four million of the Aubrey-Maturin books have sold in the United States alone . They 've given rise to Web sites , a newsletter , a cookbook re-creating the vittles  --  like soused hog 's face  --  that his seamen relished , and CDs of the music that O'Brian had Aubrey , who scratched away on the violin , and Maturin , a cellist , play together . <p> O'Brian published the first of the 20 Aubrey-Maturin novels , Master and Commander , in 1969 . Reviewing the 12th , The Letter of Marque , in 1991 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the front page of the New York Times Book Review that the series constituted " the best historical novels ever written . " Fans have been as disparate as Tom Stoppard and Walter Cronkite , David Mamet and Iris Murdoch . O'Brian was frequently described in print as a reclusive Irish gentleman who had repaired to a village in southern France , where he wrote his elegant prose in longhand . In 2000 , O'Brian died at the age of 85 while working on the 21st installment , leaving an unraveling secret : he was not who he said he was . Just as he had invented his addictive tales , he had , it turned out , invented himself . <p> I was a senior correspondent at the Los Angeles Times when I met O'Brian in California in 1995 during his tour to promote the 17th novel in the series , The Commodore . He answered respectful questions from Robert Hass , soon to be named poet laureate of the United States , in San Francisco 's Herbst Theater , before an audience of 900 . At the University @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Charlton Heston questioned the then 80-year-old author and with gravity read aloud the scene in The Reverse of the Medal ( No . II ) in which Aubrey is put in the pillory after being wrongly accused of rigging the stock market . A woman in the audience , complimenting O'Brian on his female characters , asked how he had gained such insight , since he had kept himself " locked up " so many years . " But , " O'Brian said with a bright smile exploding across his tan , fierce-eyed old man 's taut face , " I was at one time young ! " <p> The O'Brian those audiences saw was the O'Brian he wanted to be : smartly if mysteriously educated , upper-class Anglo-Irish , tart of tongue and insistent on holding the advantage in talk , and prickly He told the UCLA audience that the reading of his youth was Smollett , Swift , Richardson , Fielding , Johnson and Gibbon . " Gibbon wrote a most noble English , " O'Brian said , adding , " It has a roll and a splendor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have the vibrant source of O'Brian 's clear , precise and slightly old-fashioned prose . ) <p> The day after O'Brian 's UCLA appearance , I saw the same careful pose and also a more open man . He was profoundly interested in natural history , so at his request we went to the Page Museum at the La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles . " Has it , then , no zygomatic arch ? " O'Brian asked an obliging curator , who had shown him the fossilized jaw of Smilodon fatalis , the saber-toothed tiger . No , she said , it does have one , and handed him the specimen . Outside , he and his soft-voiced wife , Mary , both looking age-worn and vulnerable , walked in the park and , like children , poked sticks into the little tar volcanoes bubbling up in the dirt . His publisher had asked interviewers not to inquire into O'Brian 's private life . Like nearly all others , I acquiesced ; I was more interested in current impressions than history . <p> In 1998 , London journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reportedly distressed O'Brian , but he did not deny them  --  and the full story was then brought out with finesse by the American writer Dean King in his 2000 book , Patrick O'Brian : A Life Revealed , published shortly after O'Brian 's death . King had been an admirer of O'Brian , publishing a lexicon and a geographical guide to the Aubrey-Maturin novels , before embarking on a biography . King found that O'Brian was not the aloof antiquarian he sometimes appeared to be . And he certainly was n't Irish . Richard Patrick Russ was born in Chalfont St. Peter , England , in 1914 . His father , Charles , was a physician but was not as financially successful as his own father , a furrier from eastern Germany Patrick 's mother , who was also English , died when he was 3 . At 25 , Patrick , already a novelist , abandoned his wife and their two children , the younger then dying of spina bifida . At 30 , he changed his name to O'Brian , shedding his German-English heritage for one Anglo-Irish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Count Dmitri Tolstoy , a barrister in England . For some years , O'Brian was in touch with his surviving son , Richard Russ , by his first wife , but they stopped speaking in 1964 , King writes . ( Mary died in 1998 . ) <p> The striking thing , in retrospect , about O'Brian 's life is the single thread that runs through it : he was a creator of tales , imaginary worlds that resonated with the pulse of an often painful personal experience . He began in his teens , writing stories about animals with rather human traits , for English boys ' magazines . In his early 20s , Oxford University Press published his novel ( under the name Russ ) set in British India , Hussein : An Entertainment , the first time that venerable press had ever published a contemporary work of fiction . Then the war came , and O'Brian began it , as did Mary , working as an ambulance driver during the blitz . Later , the two reportedly did some sort of intelligence work , perhaps communicating with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they lived in a cottage on a sheep farm in remotest Wales . He wrote stories and a novel , Testimonies , revealing a writer of anxiety and apprehension , with hints of despair , who 'd forged a precise and delicate style . The poet Delmore Schwartz praised the novel as a triumph , saying it was finer than some works by Waugh , Hemingway and Steinbeck . In 1949 , the O'Brians moved to the French-Catalan village of Collioure under the arms of the Pyrenees . He did translations from the French ( including Simone de Beauvoir 's novels and Henri Charrire 's Papillon , about a prisoner at Devil 's Island ) and produced well-received biographies of Picasso and of the British naturalist Sir Joseph Banks . <p> The Aubrey-Maturin series came about almost by accident . In 1956 , O'Brian published The Golden Ocean , a novel for young readers about the Royal Navy in the Napoleonic Wars . A decade later , a Philadelphia publishing house , J. B. Lippincott Company , was hunting for someone to write a kind of sequel to the popular Captain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in 1966 . The firm approached O'Brian , who rose to the challenge with Master and Commander . ( Though the movie borrows the title of the first novel , it dramatizes events from more than one . ) He had n't planned on writing a continuing saga , but the first was such a success that he wrote another , and so on . A British publishing firm , William Collins ( later to become HarperCollins ) , joined in , and W.W. Norton purchased the series ' U.S. rights in 1989 . <p> The friendship between Aubrey ( bluff , hearty , inescapably English and most at home on the sea ) and Maturin ( detached , ironical , secretive and terrestrial ) is the emotional hinge on which the series swings . " I look upon them rather as positive and negative , the exchange between which expresses what I have to say , " O'Brian said at the reading in San Francisco . The constancy of friendship , the virtue of loyalty and the eventual triumph of goodness are essential elements in the books ' appeal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the goodness , the just outcome , he could not wholly achieve in life . In the books there is trouble , there is danger , there is indeed betrayal  --  but not by the principals . Like the discursive talks Aubrey and Maturin engage in over dinner and wine in the captain 's broad-windowed cabin , one 's encounters with his novels are , above all , agreeable . That is probably the secret of his great success . When the noisy , intrusive contemporary world is reflected so accurately by many writers of fiction , O'Brian offers a way out , yes , an escape . His charm lies in the way he created an artificial world in which the reader happily believes . <p> The Aubrey-Maturin novels , the Oxford don and literary critic John Bayley wrote to me in response to an inquiry , can be considered " an elevated parodic genre narrative . His characters , even his minor ones , are superbly done . " Bayley , who with his late wife , the novelist Iris Murdoch , often praised the series , added that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nature of an extended parody , " with the obvious influence being that of Jane Austen . Bayley also suggested that O'Brian " is a kind of humorous writer , perhaps a distant connection of P. G. Wodehouse , even of Wodehouse 's schoolmate Raymond Chandler , who I read with the same enjoyment , and for something like the same reasons . " <p> Has the reception of O'Brian 's work been damaged by the revelations about his real life ? When the news broke , Fleet Street turned on him  --  the Sunday Times of London called him a monster , a coward , a hypocrite . But the prevailing sentiment is more likely that of the Economist in its fond obituary , which suggested O'Brian 's literary persona was a deception " of the most innocent kind . " <p> Will O'Brian 's work endure ? The Commodore begins : " Thick weather in the chops of the Channel and a dirty night , with the strong north-east wind bringing the rain from the low sky and racing cloud : Ushant somewhere away on the starboard bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light , never a star to be seen ; and no observation for the last four days . " It is hard to imagine that coming generations of readers will not be beguiled . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Adored for his sea-soaked prose , O'Brian ( aboard the Rose in New York City at age 80 in 1995 ) was n't much of a sailor . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Before he became O'Brian , Patrick Russ ( in 1939 at age 25 , with son Richard ) lived in Suffolk , England , with his wife and two children , whom he abandoned . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : History , wrote O'Brian ( at the 1995 party aboard the Rose , with his second wife , Mary , and editor Starling Lawrence ) , has been shaped decisively by sea battles . <p> By Anthony Day <p> <p> ANTHONT DAY , for 18 years the editorial page editor of the Los Angeles Times until 1989 , now lives in Santa Fe , New Mexico . <p>     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
