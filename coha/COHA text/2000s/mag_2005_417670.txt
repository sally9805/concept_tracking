NAACP Board Chairman Julian Bond says the Black leadership changes are not a cause for alarm . // WE are witnessing an un-precedented changing of the guard in Black American leadership , and many followers are wondering what 's going on , and where do we go from here . Within the last two years , five of Black America 's top civil rights and advocacy organizations-the NAACP , the National Urban League , the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , the United Negro College Fund ( UNCF ) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference ( SCLC ) - have named new executives or are looking for a new leader . Some historians and other political observers note that this is perhaps the biggest upheaval in Black leadership structures ever . And while most of the Black leaders interviewed for this story agree that the leadership helm changes are dramatic , there is no need for alarm . It was perhaps the November 2004 departure of Kweisi Mfume from the NAACP that really put the spotlight on the number of changes at the top . His decision to step down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights organization into a national search for a president . NAACP Board Chairman Julian Bond says the organization is conducting a search and hopes to have someone on board when the organization 's convention begins in July in Milwaukee . Bond notes that the numerous leadership changes have been orderly . " Whenever there is a change , you want the next person to be the best possible person . I think this change is sort of ordinary , " he says . " People leave . People come and people go . I would n't call it an upheaval . " Photograph Marc Morial , president of the National Urban League , and Charles Steele Jr . ( below ) , president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , have recently taken the reins of two of Black America 's most important organizations . // National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial was elected to this post in 2003 , taking over from Hugh B. Price , who led the organization for nine years . Morial agrees that the turnover rate is unprecedented . " Probably for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this turnover in the same two-year window . " Traditionally , he says , leadership in these organizations remained the same for 20 years or more , but in this modern age , leaders wo n't remain at the helm that long . " It 's a healthy passing of the torch that people do n't sit in these positions forever , " he adds . " And there 's something to be said about people being fresh and energetic and having a sense of hope and optimism , which I think is what it takes to be successful in these leadership positions . " Dr. Michael Lomax , president and CEO , United Negro College Fund ( UNCF ) , took the UNCF helm in 2004 after the retirement of William H. Gray III , who led the UNCF for 12 years . Lomax , a former president of Dillard University , says the changes have been " careful and deliberative in ensuring seamless transitions . I do n't see any need for concern . " Theodore M. Shaw , director-counsel and president of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been this much rapid change in leadership in Black organizations . " One of my personal mottos is " change is growth " for institutions and for individuals , " he says . " I think it 's a sign of institutional suicide when people stay in positions forever and do n't bring another generation in . I know for myself personally , when I 've given this job what I can give , and when it 's time for me to pass the baton to somebody else , that will be one of the most important decisions I can make . " Shaw is only the fifth person to head the organization since it was established in 1940 under Thurgood Marshall . He took over last year following the departure of Elaine R. Jones , who retired after 11 years in the post and 32 years with the organization . The Rev. Jesse L. Jackson Sr. , founder and president of the Rainbow/PUSH Coalition , says what we are seeing is " a continuum within the organization , " with leaders changing as the struggle continues . " The base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . Morial concurs with Jackson , adding , " I think that organizational leadership has broadened significantly . It 's not only those of us who lead civil rights organizations , but it 's a broad range of people who lead a whole range of new organizations , and we also have an increasing broadening of the number of African-American elected officials . " Some activists continue to suggest that Sisters need to be more seriously considered for major leadership posts . NAACP Chairman Bond agrees , but points out that there are now many more Black female leaders . " It used to be that when you thought about women leaders , you thought only about Mrs. Mary McLeod Bethune and Dorothy Height , " Bond says . " There are many , many more women in the mix now . " The good news , Jackson says , is there are more Black representatives in Congress than ever before . " At one time it was just the NAACP , and there were no Black elected officials at all . The SCLC has a new leader , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charles Steele Jr. , recently appointed national president of the SCLC , says the changes are part of a natural " paradigm shift . " The venerable civil rights organization-co-founded by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. - was catapulted into a national controversy after two consecutive presidents resigned in as many years , one being Martin Luther King III . " This is a new day and a new way , " Steele says of the organization , pointing out that more than half of the population in this country was born after King 's 1968 assassination . " It 's a new world order . " Photograph Dr. Michael Lomax and Theodore M. Shaw ( below ) have continued the traditions of the United Negro College Fund and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . // The SCLC already is planning to implement conflict resolution centers around the world , and , in addition , the group has been asked by the Israeli government to help in Middle East peace talks . And there are plans to build bridges with the hip-hop generation . But it is generally acknowledged that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ personal knowledge of the Civil Rights Movement , is a challenge for Black leaders . " All too often , I see signs that the 20-something and 30-something generations have a greater sense of entitlement than one of obligation and responsibility , " says Dr. Lomax of the UNCF . All of the leaders agree that organizations must have more community support to survive and thrive in the future . " Fifty years ago we asked African-Americans to march , " Lomax says , " but today we ask them to contribute financially to our most important institutions , the colleges that educate our young . " Morial advocates a renewal of support for African-American leadership through a concept he calls " civic tithing " and philanthropy . He suggests that on Dr. King 's birthday , or another acceptable date , everyone gives $10 to an organization that he or she believes furthers the dream of Dr. King . In addition to needing greater financial support , Shaw of the NAACP Legal Defense Fund says major leadership organizations also need moral support . " We need people to be engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with us , " he says , adding that the Defense Fund is emphasizing criminal justice , judicial nominations and the extension of the Voting Rights Act , which is up for renewal in part in 2007 . " We need folks to be activists . " Both Lomax and Steele concur and conclude that Black America needs a resurgence of activism centering on economic issues and poverty . " I think we left the streets and went into the suites , " Steele says with a wry laugh . " I 'm not saying that we should n't be in the suites , but you have to have a balance , and we have to be a voice within our society in terms of representing the poor . " Those efforts continue to be at the forefront of these organizations ' agenda while in the midst of what some observers call " a natural sea change of leadership . " The focus continues to be closing the divide between the haves and the have-nots as the leadership looks toward the future . " We need to prepare our children and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says , " so that when it is time to pass the torch to the next group of leaders , they will be ready to receive it .
