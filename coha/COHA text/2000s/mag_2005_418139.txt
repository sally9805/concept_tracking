SOMETHING 'S NOT RIGHT IN ROBOT CITY . An evil plan has been hatched to rid the city of outmoded robots like Rodney . Now his hero , Bigweld , has disappeared ; and it 's up to Rodney to find him . Along the way , he gets help from ' bots such as Crank , a three-wheeled robot whose lower half looks like a car . The idea of a car robot is n't made up . In 2004 a car called Sandstorm drove nearly seven ; and a half miles without a human driver . NG KIDS found out which other robots from the movie may soon show up in your life-and which ones are still science fiction . ON PATROL Rodney finds shelter with a group of out-of-date robots called the Rusties at a boarding house run by Aunt Fanny , who proclaims she " takes in ' bots that are broke . " Aunt Fanny takes care of robots in her home ; in the real world , Fujitsu 's MARON-1 robot may one day take care of things in your home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house and send pictures from its camera to a cell phone , letting you know everything 's cool . TEAM EFFORT How out of date are the Rustles ? " No one is making replacement parts for them anymore , " says director Chris Wedge . That 's why they work together , like when they help Rodney fix hundreds of brokendown robots . Working together is a &gt; strategy that real-world roboticists find effective . For example , engineers are envisioning a system in which a main I robot commands other robots to get a job done : One vacuums , another washes windows , and yet another dusts . " It 's the next step beyond robotic vacuum cleaners , " says Colin Angle of iRobot . It 's like a robotic boss making its robotic employees do all the dirty work ! MUSCLE ' BOTS Lug is the biggest and strongest of the Rustics . He can pick up a Dumpster to look underneath for spare parts , and he can lift all his friends off the ground for a group hug . Like Lug , Kawada 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over five feet tall and 128 pounds-which makes it human size-HRP-2P can bend its knees and work with a human partner to lift a 20-pound object . It can even get up if it falls downquite an accomplishment for a robot ! AT YOUR SERVICE Rodney 's clad is a dishwasher at a restaurant-literally ! To do his job , he pops open a door on his chest , loads the dishes , and turns himself on . In reality , engineers are years away from creating reliable , affordable personal-servant robots . Mitsubishi 's Wakamaru may not do dishes , but it 's a step in the right direction . " It 's designed to open doors and bring you food , " says Dan Kara , president of Robotics Trends . It will even respond when you call it . Just do n't expect to get off dish duty any time soon . ROBOT GROOVE At a party , Rodney has a great time rockin ' to a band . In Robot City , each band member resembles a mechanical version of its instrument . For instance , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drums . Toyota has created a real humanoid robot that can play the trumpet . With its artificial lips and motorized fingers , the robot can play up to 30 songs . The ' bot was developed as a helper robot , so the trumpet talent is just for show . But the robot really can toot its own horn ! TALKING HEAD Diesel , a member of the Rusties , is the silent type-but that 's because he ca n't talk . He 's constantly looking for a voice box , but most do n't quite work out . ( One voice box makes cow noises ! ) Valerie , a real robotic receptionist at Carnegie Mellon University , has no trouble talking . She greets people , provides directions , and tells stories about her life . But to talk to Valerie , you have to type on a keyboard . Valerie 's better at talking than listening .
