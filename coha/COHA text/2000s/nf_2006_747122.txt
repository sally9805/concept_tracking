The Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn 2004 study indicates that diagnostic confusion between ADD/ADHD and giftedness exists , and that research on medication practices is warranted . Mika disagrees , saying that there is no empirical evidence of misdiagnosis of gifted children as having ADD/ADHD . We disagree with Mika 's logic , and describe evidence that suggests that such misdiagnosis does occur , with possible concurrent risks . <p> We were very pleased to see the excellent research performed and published by Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn ( 2004 ) . The study was well planned and informative , and the conclusions were thoughtful and appropriately cautious . This research provides empirical evidence of the difficulty in differentiating ADD/ADHD from giftedness , and makes an excellent case for factoring giftedness into the differential diagnosis equation when the initial impression or complaint is " ADD " or the more vague description of " attention problems . " Accurate diagnosis  --  of giftedness , ADD/ADHD , or both  --  is the only route to appropriate treatment . This study suggests that knowledge , or at least awareness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those distinctions , affirming the adage in medicine : " What you do not know , you do not recognize . " Response to Mika <p> We are , frankly , puzzled by Elizabeth Mika 's comments on the study and conclusions . Maybe the problem is a misunderstanding of " empirical evidence . " Empirical evidence can be either experimental or experience based ; therefore Mika 's logic is faulty in her criticisms of the original article and the issues concerning misdiagnosis of ADHD . <p> First , she states , " there is no empirical evidence proving the existence of the problem of misdiagnosis of giftedness for ADHD " ( Mika , 2006 , p. 237 ) and then concludes that therefore there is no problem . An absence of data would indicate only that one can not answer the question , not that there is no problem . However , some data do exist that point to a problem . There is experiential ( observational ) empirical evidence in the literature , and the Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn ( 2004 ) study is experimental empirical evidence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evidence with evidence of absence . Granted , there is a limited amount of research on misdiagnosis issues , but that does not mean that there is no problem . Research rarely precedes the raising of a question . Hopefully the concerns raised by Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn ( 2004 ) will prompt further inquiry . Parenthetically , it seems odd that the DSM-IV-TR would make a point of identifying " high intelligence " in an understimulating academic environment as a differential diagnostic issue that must be ruled out for ADHD if the writers of the DSM-IV-TR did not regard intelligence as a potential factor ( American Psychiatric Association , 2000 , p. 91 ) . <p> The experience-based empirical evidence , such as the long valued medical tradition of publishing case reports , has not yet been embraced by the gifted education community . There are a number of reasons for this , not least of all that there is no gold standard for definitive diagnosis . Nevertheless , the issue of differentiating between gifted and ADHD has been in the literature for over 10 years , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there are numerous anecdotal reports scattered throughout the literature , mostly as vignettes . Many individuals in the field of giftedness have encountered this issue of differentiation between ADHD and gifted behaviors in their practices . Comparison tables showing how the criteria for ADD/ADHD should be scrutinized to rule out giftedness are published ( e.g. , Lind , 1996 ) . <p> Unfortunately many cases of misdiagnosis are not brought to light . One of the authors of the present article can attest that her highly gifted son was " diagnosed " with ADD at least five times , though she knew , as his mother and as a pediatrician , that he did not meet the criteria . These " diagnoses " were based on teacher and parent checklists and office observation . They came from one neurologist , one developmental pediatrician , one psychologist , and at least two teachers . He was denied admission to a private school based on a teacher 's off-the-cuff diagnosis of ADD . Luckily she was able to get him referred for testing by a neuropsychologist who reported that her son had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The neurologist/psychiatrist he saw subsequently retested him to confirm this for himself . <p> The DSM-IV-TR makes the point that Attention Deficit Disorders are supposed to be diagnoses of exclusion because attention can be compromised by mood and anxiety disorders , psychotic processes , lack of academic challenge , sleep disorders , learning disabilities , traumatic brain injury , movement disorders , seizures , or simple refusal to attend . During the usual 15 minutes allotted per patient , even the most dedicated pediatrician can not begin to comply with the diagnostic requirements of the DSM-IV-TR . Yet the ADHD diagnosis can not be given without having ruled out each of those disorders ; the standard is deliberately quite high since the ADHD diagnosis often means the end of the inquiry . The U.S. Department of Education ( 1994 ) has historically held the same standard mandating that all other possible causes of behavior are ruled out before a student is designated ADD . <p> Although some information can be found in the literature , published empirical data are sparse . Gifted children are rare , so it follows that data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write up case reports , more journals will print them , and a body of data would be accumulated about misdiagnosis , as it has been for rare conditions in medicine . Such data then justifies further research . <p> Second , Mika asserts that there are no data to indicate that gifted children are unnecessarily medicated . This assertion is likewise inaccurate . Granted , there are no experimental data to date on this question because the issue of misdiagnosis has not yet received much attention , but there are other data . For example , there are letters reported to the National Foundation for Gifted and Creative Children documenting cases of drugging gifted children to make them more docile ( Friedel , 1997 ) . There are also numerous anecdotal reports shared by parents of gifted children on various ListServs , as well as conversations among practitioners . Again , publication of more case reports would grow the literature base and promote more research . <p> The Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn ( 2004 ) study indicated that diagnostic confusion between ADD/ADHD and giftedness exists , and their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practices is warranted . The authors of the newly published Misdiagnosis and Dual Diagnoses of Gifted Children and Adults ( J. T. Webb , Amend , N. Webb , Goerss , Beljan , &; Olenchak , 2005 ) agree . The clinical observational and testing data from their own practices do indicate that ( a ) inaccurate diagnoses of ADHD do occur in gifted children  --  and occur commonly , ( b ) these children are sometimes unnecessarily medicated , and ( c ) that children may respond as well , or better , to curricular modifications or a more appropriate educational environment than to medication . <p> Third , Mika suggested that there are no negative effects from stimulant medication . There is substantial research indicating that each of the medications used for ADHD in children has side effects , many of which are not trivial . Stimulant drugs are associated with higher rates of later depression , can initiate or exacerbate tic disorders , and can even provoke thought disorder in individuals with that predisposition . Stimulant medications are scheduled drugs , meaning they are recognized by the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also in the midst of physical growth and development well into their late 20 's . We do not know the effects on neurodevelopment when medications are taken for a decade or more of childhood . We know even less about the effects when medications are given to very young children . Brain-imaging studies in humans and neuropsychological studies in nonhuman animals have shown that repeated drug use causes disruptions in the brain 's highly evolved frontal , response inhibition , planning cortex , which regulates cognitive activities such as decision-making and memory ( Carpenter , 2001 ) . <p> Any time medication is used inappropriately there are two negative consequences  --  the presence of side effects , and the absence of appropriate therapy . There is also the possibility that we are crudely tampering with the neural development of a child , despite having only an emerging understanding of the brain . <p> Finally , in the field of genetics there is a term " genetic heterogeneity , " meaning there are individuals with indistinguishable signs and symptoms whose underlying genetic defects differ from one another . Put another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures . Sorting out the underlying causes is essential if we are to find specific and effective therapies . There are numerous examples of this phenomenon in clinical medicine . ADHD and giftedness may manifest with similar problem behaviors , but the cause and the cure are completely different . Mika is correct when she notes the behaviors in the Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn ( 2004 ) vignette are not " characteristics " or " evidence " of giftedness , but we would argue that the behaviors could reflect giftedness as an underlying cause of the behaviors . <p> Mika is also correct when she notes that our best guesses at diagnoses should take into account the entire picture : thoughts , behavior , context and environment , past history , medical condition , and functionality . What the research by Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn ( 2004 ) shows us , taken together with numerous articles describing the clinical experience of thoughtful professionals , is that intelligence is an important part of the diagnostic picture , but  --  due to lack of awareness or knowledge about giftedness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by many clinicians in their diagnostic thinking . Research Today <p> All science begins with observation , leads to experimentation , and eventually concludes with understanding . The Hartnett , Nelson , and Rinn ( 2004 ) study takes the issue of misdiagnosis from observation to experiment , and thus advances our understanding of ADHD and giftedness . This study also indicates that simply being aware of giftedness as an underlying cause of symptoms increases the probability the diagnosis will be explored more carefully by clinicians . <p> At the heart of Mika 's objections is the longing for hard science and facts in a nascent field of knowledge . Empirical ( though not necessarily experimental ) evidence is the only kind of evidence we have in our attempts to understand the workings of the mind and the associated behavior . Empirical evidence is based on experiments or experience . In the hierarchy of scientific inquiry , empirical evidence is barely a step away from pure observation , the foundation of science . In the hard sciences , anecdotal observation alone is considered unreliable information upon which to base a conclusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ credible , and experimental data are better still . However , in applied sciences , like medicine , accumulated experience is sometimes the only information available . Currently , in the fields of psychology , psychiatry , education  --  and indeed any field which tries to fathom complex human behavior or thought  --  empirical evidence , sometimes from accumulated experience , is all we have . Thus , in these fields , there are no " facts " in the strictest sense of the word . The Future <p> The greatest obstacle between clinicians and accurate behavioral diagnoses is the absence of a gold standard for any disorder of the mind . Scientists are currently exploring functional brain imaging in an effort to advance our understanding of these disorders , but we are still far from having the tools we would need to make accurate diagnoses by these methods . <p> As an example , we theorize that the superficial symptoms shared by giftedness and ADHD may be the result of an imbalance between cortical and subcortical function . However , until we can measure such things , the theory will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all other practitioners , muddle through and do the best we can , occasionally reminding ourselves that we do not know much . <p> " To pretend to know when you do not know is a disease .
