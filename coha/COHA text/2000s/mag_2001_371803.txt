At the height of his 1960s troubles , when as a conscientious objector he has refused induction into the Army , when he 's been stripped of his title and not allowed to fight , someone asks Muhammad Ali if he even knows where Vietnam is . Sure , he replies . " It 's on TV . " <P> It is a cosmic moment in Ali , Michael Mann 's sober and often stirring film biography , a perfect representation of the instinctive , almost visionary , shrewdness that lay beneath Ali 's doggerel-spewing , hyperkinetic image . Bloodied and staggering under the blows of coarsely baying public opinion , he understood before most of us did that it was another kind of imagery  --  that selected by the media to symbolize the war to American civilians  --  that would determine the war 's outcome and his own fate . <P> He probably could not then or even now explain his almost mystical connection with America 's unofficial psyche : that best part of us that silently , often humorously , resists all the political and journalistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing about Mann 's film ( which he co-wrote with four others ) is that it does not impose conventional motivations on Ali . It just lets him be , without a lot of back story or psychologizing . We do n't learn , for example , exactly why he turned on Malcolm X , who had mentored him in Muslimism ; we just suddenly see him do so . We do n't know exactly what he and Howard Cosell saw in each other ; we just see him and the sportscaster ( Jon Voight in some rather grotesque makeup ) juking and jiving  --  playing their own mutually advantageous game while the rest of the media stumble cluelessly in their wake . Ali was rope-a-doping the world long before he applied the technique to George Foreman in Zaire . <P> The film , like all biopics , can give only an impression of its subject 's life . And so it elides much of Ali 's busy romantic history ( three relationships stand in for many ) , and we get a pretty fragmented sense of how he managed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are times when the film makes us hunger for more ( or at least better connected ) information . There are times in Will Smith 's performance when you wish he would be a little less conscientious in his imitation of life , a little more , well , yes , instinctive in his performance . And Mann 's reconstruction of the Rumble in the Jungle with Foreman ca n't match the lunatic intensity of Leon Gast 's great documentary on the subject , When We Were Kings . <P> But still , there is also great sweetness and appeal in Smith 's work ; the supporting cast , led by Jamie Foxx 's Drew ( Bundini ) Brown , is strong and real . The boxing sequences are superbly directed by Mann and ferociously enacted by Smith and a variety of sparring partners . And maybe the slight air of cautiousness that clings to this very conscientious film is a good thing . It does not brutally impose itself on the audience as so many big , riskily expensive films do . It permits us , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but also about the times Ali helped shape and which ultimately , quite miraculously , helped shape him . A thoughtful epic is both a rarity and an oxymoron . But that 's what Ali is , and you ca n't help being drawn sympathetically into its hero 's struggle for mastery of himself and his era . <P>  --  By Richard Schickel
