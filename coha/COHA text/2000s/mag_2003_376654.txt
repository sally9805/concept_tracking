Here 's the thing about Jack Nicholson : some women really like him , and other women ca n't stand him . Fortunately he can tell the difference : " I know when I got these four or five girls standing around me , talking to me , and , you know , it 's nice  --  I know the one that flat-out hates me . You know what I mean ? The one that 's never gon na like one thing I ever do . And because I know , it becomes clear to me when I 'm going to confront this to my greatest advantage . So it 's always a great delight to me when , in all candor , I can turn to a person of this nature  --  who probably has n't even seen the picture , and already she does n't like it  --  when I can turn to her and say , ' You know , I 'm not working now , so I can be very honest with you : I do n't give a f what you think ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ galvanize a conversation . " <P> Yes , it will . And here 's something else to talk about : Nicholson 's new movie , Something 's Got ta Give , is a chick flick about as unapologetic as they come . Can Jack , the unrepentant seducer , the legendary monster of appetites , the roguish charmer , turn himself into the king of hearts ? Or put another way , would you buy from this man an unblushing , sentimental , picnics-on-the-beach romantic comedy about the joys of committed love ? <P> He still looks good at 66 , though his face is fleshier and squarer and seems on pace to merge completely with his neck sometime around 2008 . But it 's still a face made for acting  --  all punctuation marks , from those pointy circumflex eyebrows to the profound parentheses on either side of his mouth . Lounging in his favorite suite at a New York City hotel , Nicholson sits in an armchair and drinks coffee and smokes Camel Lights . After a weekend of interviews , his lilting , comforting-yet-unnerving voice is shot to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Nicholson is a talker , and when he wants to talk , by God , he 's going to talk . <P> Nicholson has made a point of defying expectations lately  --  his physical transformation into a stoop-shouldered loser retiree in last year 's About Schmidt earned him his 12th Oscar nomination , and a goofball turn opposite Adam Sandler in Anger Management showed that he can mix it up with the most sophomoric . But Something 's Got ta Give , which opens on Dec. 12 , reads like an attempt to completely dismantle his public persona : he spends the first half of the movie playing directly to type and the second half dead set against it . Nicholson plays Harry Sanborn , 63 , a rich , unmarried and devilishly charming Manhattan businessman who dates only women under 30 . One weekend Harry scampers off with his girlfriend  --  played by the lively Amanda Peet ( in reality , an over-the-hill 31 )  --  to her mother 's beach house , only to keel over with a heart attack as soon as the fun starts . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the care of her divorced mom Erica ( Diane Keaton ) , a tough-minded , successful playwright with no patience whatsoever for Harry and his boyish high jinks . But as the two are forced into each other 's company , Harry sheds his lifelong bias against older women and Erica her carefully constructed emotional barriers . It 's a December-December romance .
