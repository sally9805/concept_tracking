Rasoanaivo Hanitrarivo ( pronounced Rah-SAH-nay-vo An-EEH-tray-va ) , singer-songwriter for the Malagasi band Tarika , confesses that she has adopted " a little bit of professionalism " since the group started touring internationally a few years ago . " Instead of using bicycle-brake cables , I use piano cables , " she says , referring to the components of her myriad stringed instruments . <P> Rasoanaivo seems loath to make any further concessions to foreign ways , at least when it comes to her band . The purist aesthetic of Tarika 's music  --  " It 's 90% Madagascar , " she says  --  testifies to her deep suspicion of globalization . " No one knows the good and bad any longer/The target becomes only to participate/No one fights for the differences , " she sings on Disease , a track from Tarika 's most recent CD , Soul Makassar ( Triloka ) . Rasoanaivo draws a distinction between what she calls " roots music " and everything else . " Roots music , " she explains , " means doing something you really feel in your blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everybody else is doing . " Non-roots music , she adds , is " something you make a decoration with . " <P> As an alternative to the homogenized pop culture Rasoanaivo decries , Tarika offers Madagascar 's folk music , which combines the traditions of Indonesia and the African mainland ( Indonesians settled the island thousands of years ago ) . Vocal harmonies as warm and light as Bornean breezes blend seamlessly with playful African polyrhythms . The disparate elements are held together by the rock-solid consistency of Randrianasolomalala Victor 's drumming and the conviction in Rasoanaivo 's vocals : the soul , perhaps , referred to in the album title . <P>  --  By Benjamin Nugent
