Mind-boggling incompetency " is how one American diplomatic source characterized Belgium 's laggard cooperation with U.S. efforts to catch terrorists . Since Belgian police arrested two men two days after the Sept. 11 attacks , American officials have pleaded for hard information ( phone numbers , addresses , travel itineraries ) on one of the men , Nizar Trabelsi , a Tunisian citizen suspected to have been the designated suicide bomber for a planned attack on the American embassy in Paris . Belgian officials say the U.S. did not properly request the Trabelsi dossier until Sept. 27 . It took weeks after that , they say , to scan the documents , which were " the thickness of seven phone books , " onto CDs and finally hand them over , on Oct. 12 . Initially , though , the discs were useless ; the Belgians had password-protected them and neglected to send along the code . Investigators in Washington were so frustrated with the stinginess from Belgium that they called the New York Times and gave the paper a blistering story that ran last Wednesday . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but U.S. officials remain dissatisfied . " We wanted an opportunity to examine the machine pistol that was allegedly found when they arrested Trabelsi , " said the source . " That still has not taken place . " Last week Belgian Justice Minister Marc Verwilghen told TIME that " Belgium wants to cooperate with American law enforcement " but strict evidentiary rules made it difficult . He also said his ministry 's influence is hampered by the " absolute power of the investigating magistrate , " whose authority , he admitted , " is not in balance with a good administration of justice .
