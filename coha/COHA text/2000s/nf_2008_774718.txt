The Coldest Morning // January 18 , 1988 , was a bitterly cold Iowa Monday . The night before , the temperature had reached minus fifteen degrees , and that did n't take into account the wind , which cut under your coat and squeezed your bones . It was a killing freeze , the kind that made it almost painful to breathe . The problem with flat land , as all of Iowa knows , is that there 's nothing to stop the weather . It blows out of Canada , across the Dakotas , and straight into town . The first bridge in Spencer across the Little Sioux , built in the late 1800s , had to be taken down because the river became so jammed with ice everyone worried the pylons would collapse . When the town water tower burned down in 1893-the straw packing used to keep the riser pipe from freezing caught fire , and all the nearby fire hydrants were frozen solid-a two-foot-thick , ten-foot-wide circle of ice slid out the top of the tank , crushed the community recreation center , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spencer for you . // I have never been a morning person , especially on a dark and cloudy January day , but I have always been dedicated . There were a few cars on the road at seven thirty , when I drove the ten blocks to work , but as usual mine was the first car in the parking lot . Across the street , the Spencer Public Library was dead-no lights , no movement , no sound until I flipped a switch and brought it to life . The heater switched on automatically during the night , but the library was still a freezer first thing in the morning . Whose idea was it to build a concrete and glass building in northern Iowa ? I needed my coffee . // I went immediately to the library staff room-nothing more than a kitchenette with a microwave and a sink , a refrigerator too messy for most people 's taste , a few chairs , and a phone for personal calls-hung up my coat , and started the coffee . Then I scanned the Saturday newspaper . Most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the library . The local newspaper , the Spencer Daily Reporter , did n't publish on Sunday or Monday , so Monday was catch-up morning for the Saturday edition . // " Good morning , Vicki , " said Jean Hollis Clark , the assistant library director , taking off her scarf and mittens . " It 's a mean one out there . " // " Good morning , Jean , " I said , putting aside the paper . // In the center of the staff room , against the back wall , was a large metal box with a hinged lid . The box was two feet high and four feet square , about the size of a two-person kitchen table if you sawed the legs in half . A metal chute rose out of the top of the box , then disappeared into the wall . At the other end , in the alley behind the building , was a metal slot : the library 's after-hours book return . // You find all kinds of things in a library drop box-garbage , rocks , snowballs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it gives people ideas , but all libraries deal with it . Video stores probably have the same problem . Stick a slot in a wall and you 're asking for trouble , especially if , as it did at the Spencer Public Library , the slot opened onto a back alley across the street from the town 's middle school . Several times we had been startled in the middle of the afternoon by a loud pop from the drop box . Inside , we 'd find a firecracker. // After the weekend , the drop box would also be full of books , so every Monday I loaded them onto one of our book carts so the clerks could process and shelve them later in the day . When I came back with the cart on this particular Monday morning , Jean was standing quietly in the middle of the room . // " I heard a noise . " // " What kind of noise ? " // " From the drop box . I think it 's an animal . " // " A what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's an animal in the drop box . " // That was when I heard it , a low rumble from under the metal cover . It did n't sound like an animal . It sounded more like an old man struggling to clear his throat . But I doubted it was an old man . The opening at the top of the chute was only a few inches wide , so that would be quite a squeeze . It was an animal , I had little doubt of that , but what kind ? I got down on my knees , reached over to the lid , and hoped for a chipmunk. // The first thing I felt was a blast of freezing air . Someone had jammed a book into the return slot , wedging it open . It was as cold in the box as it was outside ; maybe colder , since the box was lined with metal . You could have kept frozen meat in there . I was still catching my breath when I saw the kitten . // It was huddled in the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its legs tucked underneath it , trying to appear as small as possible . The books were piled haphazardly to the top of the box , partially hiding it from view . I lifted one gingerly for a better look . The kitten looked up at me , slowly and sadly . Then it lowered its head and sank down into its hole . It was n't trying to appear tough . It was n't trying to hide . I do n't even think it was scared . It was just hoping to be saved . // I know melting can be a clich ? , but I think that 's what actually happened to me at that moment : I lost every bone in my body . I am not a mushy person . I 'm a single mother and a farm girl who has steered her life through hard times , but this was so , so ... unexpected . // I lifted the kitten out of the box . My hands nearly swallowed it . We found out later it was eight weeks old , but it looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was so thin I could see every rib . I could feel its heart beating , its lungs pumping . The poor kitten was so weak it could barely hold up its head , and it was shaking uncontrollably . It opened its mouth , but the sound , which came two seconds later , was weak and ragged . // And cold . That 's what I remember most , because I could n't believe a living animal could be so cold . It felt like there was no warmth at all . So I cradled the kitten in my arms to share my heat . It did n't fight . Instead , it snuggled into my chest , then laid its head against my heart . // " Oh , my golly , " said Jean . // " The poor baby , " I said , squeezing tighter . // " It 's adorable. " // Neither of us said anything for a while . We were just staring at the kitten . Finally Jean said , " How do you think it got in there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was only thinking about right now . It was too early to call the veterinarian , who would n't be in for an hour . But the kitten was so cold . Even in the warmth of my arms , I could feel it shaking . // " We 've got to do something , " I said . // Jean grabbed a towel , and we wrapped the little fellow up until only its nose was sticking out , its huge eyes staring from the shadows in disbelief . // " Let 's give it a warm bath , " I said . " Maybe that will stop the shivering. " // I filled the staff room sink with warm water , testing it with my elbow as I clutched the kitten in my arms . It slid into the sink like a block of ice . Jean found some shampoo in the art closet , and I rubbed the kitten slowly and lovingly , almost petting it . As the water turned grayer and grayer , the kitten 's wild shivering turned to soft purring . I smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very young . When I finally lifted it out of the sink , it looked like a newborn : huge lidded eyes and big ears sticking out from a tiny head and an even smaller body . Wet , defenseless , and meowing quietly for its mother . // We dried it with the blow dryer we used for drying glue at craft time . Within thirty seconds , I was holding a beautiful , long-haired orange tabby . The kitten had been so filthy , I had thought it was gray . // By this time Doris and Kim had arrived , and there were four people in the staff room , each cooing over the kitten . Eight hands touched it , seemingly at once . The other three staffers talked over one another while I stood silently cradling the kitten like a baby and rocking back and forth from foot to foot . // " Where did it come from ? " // " The drop box . " // " No ! " // " Is it a boy or a girl ? " // I glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A boy , " I said . // " He 's beautiful . " // " How old is he ? " // " How did he get in the box ? " // I was n't listening . I only had eyes for the kitten . // " It 's so cold . " // " Bitterly cold . " // " The coldest morning of the year . " // A pause , then : " Someone must have put him in the box . " // " That 's awful . " // " Maybe they were trying to save him . From the cold . " // " I do n't know ... he 's so helpless . " // " He 's so young . " // " He 's so beautiful . Oh , he 's breaking my heart . " // I put him down on the table . The poor kitten could barely stand . The pads on all four of his paws were frostbitten , and over the next week they would turn white and peel off . And yet the kitten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table and slowly looked up into each face . Then he began to hobble . As each person reached to pet him , he rubbed his tiny head against her hand and purred . Forget the horrible events in his young life . Forget the cruel person who shoved him down that library drop box . It was as if , from that moment on , he wanted to personally thank every person he ever met for saving his life . // By now it had been twenty minutes since I pulled the kitten out of the drop box , and I 'd had plenty of time to think through a few things-the once common practice of keeping library cats , my ongoing plan to make the library more friendly and appealing , the logistics of bowls and food and cat litter , the trusting expression on the kitten 's face when he burrowed into my chest and looked up into my eyes . So I was more than prepared when someone finally asked , // " What should we do with him ? " // " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me , " maybe we can keep him . " // ( Continues ... ) //
