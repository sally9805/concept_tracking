In which the artist ranges from his early days in New York to 21st-century Berlin , via such concerns as the pleasures of large scale , the military-industrial complex , traditional painting techniques , the markup on breakfast cereal and the end of the world . // The right half of The Swimmer in the Econo-mist ( painting 1 ) , 1997-98 , oil on canvas , 11 by 90 1/8 feet overall . Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin . ( Work continued from previous spread. ) // In the late 1950s , James Rosenquist ( born in 1933 in Grand Forks , N.D. ) made a living by painting billboards in New York City . He learned how to combine disparate images in compositions that he would execute high above the ground at vastly enlarged scale . When in 1960 Rosenquist abandoned the perilous business of billboard painting for the life of the artist , he decided to adapt the techniques , scale and popular iconography he knew so well . These would allow him to give form to an idiosyncratic body of work examining many aspects of modern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had experimented with in his earlier easel painting . By then , the artist had developed a canny understanding both of how images drawn from the mass media project meaning and of how accepted meanings can be destabilized by fragmenting and enlarging images , simplifying their forms , softening their focus , modifying their color and placing them in unexpected situations . Following his first solo show , at Richard Bellamy 's Green Gallery in January 1962 , Rosenquist was quickly recognized as one of the protagonists of the developing Pop art movement . In huge paintings that often invite allegorical reading , monumental , dramatically cropped objects and figures are juxtaposed . In more recent work , the painter creates colorful , quasi-abstract configurations fraught with dynamism . James Rosenquist 's retrospective exhibition was recently on view at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York City . - M.A . Michael Amy : You have been painting fragments of things since the inception of your career . How did that come about ? James Rosenquist : I was probably born with the ability to draw , but that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cameron Booth at the University of Minnesota , had studied with Hans Hofmann somewhere in Europe after World War I. He taught picture making , dynamic picture making , including Cubism-ideas about form and fragments and everything else . How to make a dynamic picture plane-that 's what I was really interested in . I won a scholarship to the Art Students League in 1955 and went to New York with 350 bucks in my pocket and studied with Morris Kantor , Robert Beverly Hale , George Grosz , Edwin Dickinson , Sidney Dickinson , Will Barnet and so on . I met a lot of people and was still studying composition . Then I went broke , busted . I was homeless for a while laughs , then a friend of mine , Ray Donarski , said he knew of a great job as a chauffeur and bartender for some very wealthy people . So we went up to see them and split the job . I took it for a year , and after a year , he would take it . I lived in the lap of luxury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a ' ' 56 Lincoln Town Car and a ' ' 56 Lincoln convertible with great big fins . I did that for a year and then transferred into the International Sign Painters and Pictorial Painters Union Local 230 in New York , where I painted outdoor pictures on billboards again . I had painted billboards for a short time in Minnesota with General Outdoor Advertising , so I had entered the union back then . My union rep was about 99 years old . You wo n't believe this , but he was a boy piano player in the 1800s in the Wild West with a medicine show . In my life , I have been fortunate to meet a lot of really old people , who go back another century-American history is very short . So I began painting in Brooklyn , painting a Hebrew National Salami sign on Flatbush Avenue , and then I was laid off and eventually went to work in Times Square for General Outdoor Advertising . // The right half of The Swimmer in the Econo-mist ( painting 1 ) , 1997-98 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overall . Deutsche Guggenhelm Berlin . ( Work continued from previous spread. ) // I am saying all of this because it explains how my personal artwork developed . Every morning , I would approach this big desk and on it there would be all kinds of images-a tomato , an automobile , a movie star , a piece of bread , a pack of cigarettes-this very varied imagery I was supposed to put in the right place on a billboard sign in Times Square . Now these images I got were not in the right scale . Some were really little ; others were really big . I had to change the scale of these images and put them in this diagram that somebody gave me . I had to learn how to render things well . You learn a lot from painting those big billboards , because of the light , color and everything . For instance , you never use pure black paint-you add a lot of white to it , because of the light . I learned a lot of tricks like that . So anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1959 I quit because two guys got killed . Abbie Marcus fell off Klein 's department store , and another guy fell off a Budweiser sign in New Jersey . So I thought : " God , this is dangerous , " because I used to work on a scaffold 20 stories up . Then I went back to work for a little longer , up to 1960 , I think . I finally left , got married , had very little money-my wife worked-and got a studio . Those were the golden days in New York . I had a five-room apartment on the Upper East Side for $31 a month ; finally , I got a waterfront studio on Coenties Slip , 45 bucks a month , a pretty big loft ; breakfast was 25 cents . New York at that time was a great cosmopolitan city where you could exist with very little money , which was a wonderful thing . My neighbors were Ellsworth Kelly , Jasper Johns , Bob Rauschenberg , Bob Indiana and Jack Youngerman-so there was a nucleus of artists there at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the art schools , everyone was still being taught to express themselves by throwing paint . But I thought , gee whiz , I want to do things differently . I wondered , how can I make a mysterious painting by painting enlarged fragments-very realistically-and putting them in a picture so that the thing closest to you would be recognized last ? So that the space would spill forward , out of the picture , instead of receding like all painting had done in the past ? Even when you look at the great French paintings at the Louvre , it seems as if you are looking at an aperture , even though they are big ; and Surrealism , too-it 's all an aperture . Things appear as if you were standing at a window or in front of a view . I wanted my pictures to be impersonal and knock you in the face ! MA : Your earliest paintings had a very soft touch to them , a soft focus , a blurring at the edges . Does that come out of billboard painting ? JR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of art laughs . People say I use my billboard technique to make art . Baloney ! I used my art technique to paint billboards . The other artists were sort of like stiff illustrators , while I knew how to paint laughs . MA : Were there artists you were particularly drawn to during the 1950s and early ' ' 60s ? JR : When I was living in the Midwest , I saw a picture in Life magazine of two guys painting a sign for the Astor Victoria Theater , which was 58 feet high and 395 feet long , and I thought : Wow , if those guys can paint that , they can paint the Sistine Chapel if they have any ideas . Within about two years , I was working right alongside Frank Richert and Jay David Mischnik , who was in that picture-I was doing the very same thing . So I thought : if I can learn how to control a big space like that , I can paint anything , if I have ideas . Then I met other artists who would put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include painting . One of those artists was Jasper Johns . He was an inspiration . He demonstrated that painting was a medium that could express ideas . I met Johns and also Rauschenberg-he became a very good friend of mine-in ' ' 56. // Astor Victoria , 1959 , billboard enamel and oil on canvas , 5 5/8 by 6 7/8 feet . // MA : Is your work autobiographical ? JR : It 's all autobiographical , everything is , all of it . Students ask me : " Where do you get your ideas ? " and I answer : " Go back to your youth , go back to when you were very young and remember the things that happened to you , things that were very odd and peculiar . " During World War II , I saw an exhibition in a museum of a shrunken head , a live flower and a little painting , which constituted a collage of sorts , and I thought : what the hell does that mean ? As a kid , I used to see optical illusions that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You could see things like three-story-high horses walking by . And time and space . . . . In a desert or on a prairie , you see something from a long distance , and you can watch that thing approach , like a car or a train or a boy running , or whatever , and you have all this time to think about why it is coming at you . It 's a different sensation out there . Those things have been inspirations. // U-Haul-It , 1967 , oil on canvas , 5 by 14 1/8 feet . Whitney Museum of American Art , New York . // MA : Although you have always been fascinated by color , sometimes you choose to steer away from it and use grisaille instead . JR : I began using grisaille when I first started , because I was trying to get below zero in my work . I was thinking : How can I introduce images again , after the development of nonobjective paintings that show only pure color and form , with no other references ? Then I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to five years old , because the memory of things that occurred three to four to five years ago is a little less than nostalgia , but it is not about the present . That was the same with the Beat generation people . They got a kick out of things that were a little rusty , a little old , not too old , and not brand new , because they could not afford them . They 'd say : " Oh man ! Look at the patina on that old bicycle-is n't that bee-u-tee-full ! " MA : Was Cubism of interest to you ? JR : Cubism is dynamic . I am sure that every Hollywood cinematographer knows about composition and the Renaissance golden mean and Cubism and everything . One uses all the knowledge one can acquire to make an interesting painting . It goes on and on and on . It does not end with Cubism-there are new ways to delight people laughs . MA : There is also the size of your images . Scale is of tremendous import . JR : I paint large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can not really tell what they are . You are sort of enveloped in an ambience of color , and if you get back and look at them , you can see that these really are compositions , these really are paintings . If you are close to it , a big painting is just a feeling around you , that 's all . Also , for me , painting large is a physical workout ; it 's fun to attempt physically-with one arm-to paint these large pictures , it 's fun seeing big forms of color . I like the physical connection of painting with a paintbrush . MA : Have movies influenced you ? JR : Sure . Remember the old-time outdoor movies , the drive-ins , with those huge outdoor screens ? Sometimes , I would just look at the lower left-hand corner of those huge images of people and things . It was a total abstraction with fuzzy colors , and I really got a kick out of that . MA : When we first spoke over the phone , you told me that I attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead , you see the images as a system of forms and colors , almost in an abstract sense . JR : Maybe , maybe , maybe . The ' ' 50s were a period of great abundance in America . World War II vets were supposed to have a house , a car and two and a half children , and their own private airplane laughs . In the ' ' 50s , we had an exterior ambience of color . We had pink toilet fixtures and blue sinks and purple refrigerators , and we had bright colored cars-I remember Sugar Ray Robinson 's pink Cadillac . You never had that in Russia , where it was all very pastoral and very drab . I was in Leningrad in 1965 and I saw a truckload of plain wooden boxes go by , and then I went back to Stockholm and I saw a truckload of apples go by with bright red apple labels , and this blur of color going by seemed to me more interesting than this pastoral Russian 19th-century look . So I was given the opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color of the interior of a supermarket , which had this big splashy array of Day-Glo-colored cereal boxes and soap boxes and a lot of other things that were very exuberant . Cereal boxes are designed as eye-catchers . The thing I dislike is that today the cereal in those boxes costs about seven cents in grain . My uncles and cousins are farmers . They get a few dollars for a bushel of wheat , yet Kellogg 's and so on get $4.00 a box . You pay much more for the color packaging than for the ingredients . I think that 's topsy-turvy . The same goes for advertising , generally speaking . It still goes on . Russia-which never had any outdoor advertising-advertised the hell out of Snickers candy bars , which resulted in a backlash against the United States laughs . I thought that was hilarious . MA : When we first spoke , I stated that today we are bombarded with images , and you said that we have always been flooded with images , that this is no new phenomenon , that there are only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rapidity now . I 've watched television since 1950 probably . Now , there are 10 or 20 commercials during programs , instead of two . Anyhow , painting those advertisements and hearing advertisements all the time felt like getting beaten over the head with a hammer . This noise pounded into my sensibility , and I thought , in this noise , in this numbness , I want to make a new kind of painting by using the power and strength in the stroke of a billboard painter 's brush . That big free style , that 's what I liked . I still think in the grand tradition of painting from Europe-Western painting . I need Western dynamism , a solar-plexus punch as in a Rembrandt . I want a visual punch to my paintings . MA : You have been labeled a Pop artist . How do you feel about that ? JR : They called me a Pop artist because I used recognizable imagery . I did n't meet Andy until 1964 . I met Roy a little earlier , but I did n't really know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happenings , met him and did not know him very well . We all sort of emerged separately and all became friends . In America , there was not a lot of backbiting . There seemed to be an abundance of ideas . If you did not want to use an idea , then maybe someone else did . Andy was always very casual about it . He would ask people if they had any good ideas he could use laughs . Funny guy . I think he was interested in the acceleration of life-the speed . It 's almost like existentialism-that 's what I think his work was about . MA : Does that also apply to you ? JR : Well , yeah , early on it did . MA : You frequented the Cedar Bar . JR : I heard about the Friday Night Club . It was a private club . You paid 50 cents and could go in some loft and hear really well-known underground artists like Stuart Davis , de Kooning , Milton Resnick , Franz Kline , a lot of people . They would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about painting or about art . Then I learned that they all went to the Cedar Bar , and I used to go there . It was really kind of a crummy bar . It was n't cozy . In there would be the most famous underground artists of the time . When I was a student , all the students were copying de Kooning . He was ferociously into the viscosity of paint . I really liked de Kooning 's involvement with paint and color . And I really liked him a lot , because he was not self-conscious at all . He told jokes , he did n't give a damn laughs . He was really a rough and tough guy . He was friendly . So was poor Franz Kline , who died in ' ' 62 . And Barney Newman was a good friend . Strange thing happened to me . I was flying from Florida to New York and I sit down on the plane and there is this big old boy there with a three-piece tweed suit . He 's old . The stewardess comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a drink , I 'm buying , " and I said , " That 's very nice , " and so he says to the woman , " Give me three Jack Daniels and give this fellow a Jack Daniels , " and I said , " Well , thank you very much . " Then he says , " What do you do ? " , and I said I 'm a painter , and he says , " Oh really , I jumped ship with a painter back in the ' ' 20s named de Kooning . You ever hear of him ? " I said , " Yeah , " and he says , " How 's he doing ? Is he doing OK ? " " He 's doing pretty well . " So I said " What do you do ? " , and he says , " I 'm the head of the New York State Liquor Authority , but I 'll probably get fired because it 's an appointment . " He did n't care . It 's funny . MA : Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said he liked my spaghetti painting-he said it was sexy . Bill de Kooning ! laughs . I knew him in New York , then he moved to East Hampton . When I moved out to East Hampton , I went to see him , and he 's painting and having a drink . He says : " Goddammit ! Who the hell asked you to come here ? " So I said , " Screw you . Goodbye , " and I get out the door and in my car , and he puts his arm in the window and he says , " Do n't leave me , you bastard , come in and have another drink . " Things like that . I mean even worse laughs . He was a famous , famous , famous underground artist , really . MA : Do you always use photographs instead of the actual objects as your models when you paint ? Take the doll paintings . JR : Yes , my paintings are often composed from photographs that I take . I found some old generic dolls and wrapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some of them looked terrifying , some looked sweet , some looked ugly . I only selected 30 out of hundreds of photographs . I painted the paintings exactly the way the photographs were . I did not make changes at that stage-I made the changes with the camera . I got the idea for the gift-wrapped dolls from Claude Debussy , who wrote pieces for his little daughters . The idea of the covering , the distortion of something , was bound to the idea of AIDS . People almost had to make a business arrangement before they made love because of the fright of contracting AIDS . MA : The dolls coincide with the growth of your young daughter . JR : That 's true , because I thought : what is my poor little daughter going to encounter in the future ? MA : A large retrospective exhibition like the one presently at the Guggenheim Museum must be both thrilling and terrifying . It offers you the opportunity to study works you have not seen in many years and think about your development as an artist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JR : Oh yeah ! laughs . Well , it 's not terrifying . Each painting is specific to a certain time . As I go through the exhibition , the paintings-especially the earlier ones-conjure the atmosphere that I lived in . With some of them I go : " Wow ! That 's when I got married ; that 's when I got divorced ; that 's when I had a terrible time ; that 's when I was in debt ; that 's when I sold a painting for a million bucks " laughs-and so it goes . So it 's like a roller-coaster ride of emotion . MA : Your retrospective includes collages that are preparatory for your paintings . You use small collage sketches to build up your compositions . The process of collage goes back to early modernism . JR : Every one of the collages exists as a work . In other words , I am not exhibiting doodles . I always thought of keeping the collages as a catalogue in case someone wanted their painting repaired : I could go back to the collage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibitions that did not have drawings and studies in them seemed to be missing something-for instance , Roy Lichtenstein did many , many , many drawings in preparation for his paintings , and that connection was missing in his Guggenheim show . So I thought , well , I am going to show these . What the hell ! MA : I am surprised that your use of collage did not lead to more experiments with the shaped canvas , a pictorial format you tried out , for instance , in 1966 , in pictures like Big Bo , Aspen , Colorado and TV Boat 1 . JR : Yeah , yeah . Why should I go on doing that ? MA : You used the shaped canvas at . one point during your career . Then you have other paintings consisting of several canvases of uneven height and width forming a highly irregular horizontal composition . JR : You know what it is , Michael : ideas come unqualified , and then you have to figure out how to do them , and that 's what it is really ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it takes a shaped canvas , you do it , and if it does n't , you do n't . Sometimes I wanted people to see themselves in my work , and so what I did in the corners of my surrounding room paintings was to use reflective surfaces , so that when you would move , the image would move a little bit . MA : A couple of your works from the ' ' 60s actually moved , electrically , and of course Tumbleweed 1963-66 was lit by neon . JR : But in general , I 've avoided electricity and cinema . I started thinking that all you need to realize the idea was your own intuition and the sun-no cinema , no electric plug-ins , nothing . A number of artists did beautiful work , like Jean Tinguely , and then the things that he used in his sculpture-like radios with vacuum tubes-went out of date and they broke , and the little motors did not work . Now , the pieces still look gorgeous , but you should have seen them when they were working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizontal format you use in so many of your paintings invites a kind of narrative reading . JR : Sometimes , yes , sometimes things are like narrative . Whenever I got a new studio , I made the largest possible painting laughs , and since the ceiling was low , the painting became horizontal . As I changed studios and got larger spaces , I made bigger paintings . MA : Your paintings almost defy explanation . JR : They do n't if you ask me , because I can usually tell you what they are about . It all has meaning to me . As I explain my paintings , I hope that they get away from me , that the idea takes off and has a life of its own . My Star Thief painting 1980 was originally called A Fractured Head on a Nuclear Pillow , and then I named it Star Thief , and an astronaut thought it was about space , but it was n't , it was about a metaphor of work , almost like playing chess . If you do physical work to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go further , but if you do n't do the physical part of it , it remains only a concept . MA : Every painting has a story . JB : I have stories for every single one of them . MA : Do these stories or anecdotes precede the act of painting ? JR : I try to develop paintings that are purely visual , to work in a visual language . MA : So are your paintings about the ambiguities of seeing and of understanding what one sees , of making sense of all those visual sensations ? JR : When I start working on a composition , the whole idea bothers me . What is going on ? This is really peculiar ! The real meaning of something may be masked by something else . I try to put parts of my images together in very dynamic , colorful ways . I try to think of my work almost as if it were nonobjective painting , and I try to do something that has a total visual attitude about it , so you think of it without words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ title on it , because it 's something extra . My dealer Leo Castelli would say imitates Italian accent , " Jim , what is the title of this ? " And then I had to work hard to try to figure out a title for something I only wanted to be visual-and then the license plate on Leo 's car said : " Untitled " ! laughs . Then again , sometimes a notion starts with a title , and then you say : " Gee ! That 's a peculiar idea ! How can I make a picture about it ? " MA : You have been fortunate in your choice of dealers . Dick Bellamy , Leo Castelli . . . JR : Totally by luck ! Dick was a Beat person who was like a street poet who used to hang out in bars , and I knew him for years , and all of a sudden he knocked on my door with Henry Geldzahler from the Met and Ivan Karp , and he said : " I am opening a gallery and I would love to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " What ? ! I am going to show with this guy who hangs out at the Cedar Bar and he 's a Beat ? " Then there was a complete turnabout of my feelings , and we became really best friends , and he turned out to be an amazing . . . . He remained a poet who became fascinated with a certain group of artists . You do n't find dealers like him around any more . He was a very straight , honest fellow . Also Leo Castelli . Leo was a gentleman , and I worked with him for 30 years with only a handshake . No contract . Likewise with Dick Bellamy . I worked with him a number of years , and I left him because of his personal difficulties , not for financial reasons . People said he did n't continue because he had financial problems . Well hell , his gallery went from red to black in only one year . Photograph The Stowaway Peers Out at the Speed of Light , 2000 , oil on canvas , 17 by 46 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , New York . // MA : You previously said that all your work is autobiographical . JR : Of course ! It could not be otherwise . MA : That terrible car crash you , your wife and son were in back in Florida in 1971 , did it have an impact upon your work ? JR : Suffering does not make art . MA : Did it give rise to ideas having to do with death and mortality that can be found in your work ? JR : Well , my dear man , one might think of death and mortality all the time , or from time to time , before that accident and after it . I painted a picture after the accident called The Persistence of Electrical Nymphs in Space 1985 . So Liv Ullmann said Scandinavian accent , " What does that mean ? " and I said , " That 's either Mahatma Gandhi 's funeral or the sound of all the souls after the earth blows up , " and she went , " Oh , ja ! " Have you ever watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then they are dead , and something seems to have left the room-an electrical spark , a soul , I do n't know what it is , but there is a cadaver left , and the spark is gone . That 's very , very peculiar I think . Energy allegedly has to go somewhere . It does not disappear . Where does the energy go if the earth blows up ? That 's a good question . MA : Your paintings are about energy ? JR : Of course ! What do you do on a two-dimensional picture plane , how do you activate it ? You give it a whirl . MA : As I bring up the issue of mortality , I am thinking that your imagery often deals with youth , splendor , beautiful things-however transformed . Are these evocations of ephemeral situations , of situations that are transient ? JR : laughs That 's funny ! MA : What about the tropical flowers that appeared in your pictures of the 1980s ? JR : That 's a long story . In some of those paintings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died were transformed into flowers or whatever , what a surprise it would be if they woke up laughs . The whole thing also came from the space program . They sent fruit flies into space , kept them alive ; monkeys , kept them alive ; then human beings , kept them alive-but they could n't keep them from going crazy , because of their parallel existences on earth and in space . So the astronauts started bringing up golf clubs and baby dolls and things to remind them of their lives on earth . I was interested in this idea of people metamorphosing , as a pictorial device . So I started using slivers of recognizable things , in contrast to other things , so that peering through the slivers you would see another dimension , but the slivers were enough as a suggestion of a person .

Guggenheim Museum , New York . // MA : So that 's how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I did lizards , dogs , wolves , other animals-but most of them were female fashion models . MA : You have an abiding interest in science . JR : I always have . Years back , in 1967 I think it was , I did a whole room of walk-through images that was inspired by the notion of the rearrangement of molecules , the idea that one could physically walk through a wall , could walk through solid substances . I exhibited this huge room in Paris and in Venice-it was called Forest Ranger 1967 . It consisted of many , many images hanging on Mylar polyester plastic that I painted the way I painted theater marquees for Artkraft-Strauss . Then I cut the Mylar into vertical strips . I painted a big armored car being sawn in two like a piece of meat , a hat-a fedora-sitting off the ground-you could kick it and it would go into digits and come back into being a hat again-that kind of idea . Also , I was interested in holography at that time , but it had not quite come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought holography was going to be amazing . I thought there was a possibility of presenting-for example-rehearsals for actors where there would be a group of images sitting in a room saying their pieces and one could enter in as a third party and interact with those holographic images as rehearsals for films , plays , everything else . It never got to that . MA : Are you interested in the Internet as a source ? JR : No . MA : Do you draw inspiration from literature ? Have certain books inspired you ? JR : No , not really . Unusual contemporary situations inspire me . Any kind of idea-a word or a thing-but usually not literature of the past . In other words , I do n't do paintings about Moby-Dick . MA : Are you interested in virtual reality ? JR : No . Not really at all . I am more interested in Hollywood invention . I met Douglas Trumbull years ago . He did the effects for the movie 2001 : A Space Odyssey , and everything he did was purely mechanical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My own technique is mechanical . I tell young people that the greatest paintings in museums are made with minerals mixed in oil schmeared on cloth with the hair from the back of a pig 's ear . It 's that simple . That 's what 's fascinating : to try to create beautiful paintings with the simplest means , which is what the old masters did . It blows me away . I saw some big Miro paintings at the old Pierre Matisse Gallery and I thought , " God ! What is that ? That is fascinating , " and when I got up close , I saw that he had rubbed color onto the canvas with silk to form big soft biomorphic shapes . They were done with the simplest techniques , and I thought that they were done with airbrush or something else . I love that , when someone can make a painting with sticks and cloths and brushes instead of high technology . MA : You recently brought Picasso into the picture . I am thinking of The Swimmer in the Econo-mist 1997-98 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Berlin . How did that come about ? JR : I looked at Guernica for years when it was at the Museum of Modern Art . I thought , how could I possibly touch Guernica ? But then I thought , well , Picasso painted from Velazquez and everyone else , so why not ? So I did an image of Guernica in a spinning vortex . MA : Is The Swimmer in the Econo-mist about the 20th century ? JR : I was asked to do paintings for the Berlin Guggenheim , which occupies part of the Deutsche Bank building . I had previously visited East Berlin , and it was a mess-it looked bombed out . The Russians had just left . I did a 38-foot-wide painting called The Holy Roman Empire through Checkpoint Charlie 1994 at a time when the Germans were really fearful that they could not assimilate East Berlin and build it up , because the cost was too much . Then I was asked to paint this painting for Berlin Deutsche Bank and I thought of a person struggling and working , like a swimmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they are going , but forcefully working , working , working . Well , they did it ! I went back to Berlin-Holy cow ! East Berlin looks like the year 2025 now . It 's incredible ! MA : So The Swimmer is about the triumph of capitalism . JR : Certainly , the painting addresses finance , capitalism . But basically , it is also about what is going to be the end of man : Is it going to be a meteor or hunger ? laughs . Years ago , it was the hydrogen bomb , and then one day the Russians turned the rockets away from Manhattan and went out for lunch , and no women , no mothers went out on the street and yelled and shouted , unlike when World War II ended . At the end of that war , my uncle Tommy went out with his shotgun and shot off three shots when the Japanese surrendered . Well , this time , nobody did anything . It was a gigantic relief , for a moment , to stop worrying about Russia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TakeF-111 1964-65 . JR : I have done paintings like Brighter Titan the Sun 1961 : What 's more powerful ? A hydrogen bomb explosion or the label of a soap box , the economy-or hunger , for instance ? MA : Are there changes as far as your interests are concerned , your range of subjects ? JR : That changes all the time , sure . A recent series is called " Speed of Light . " The idea of the " Speed of Light " pictures is : according to Einstein , the traveler and the spectator look at the same thing and they see it differently because of the speed of light . This came to me because when I would do paintings , I was always amazed at who liked what , and I thought the most sophisticated people sometimes were n't , and the people who I thought were n't sophisticated really could see things visually . Some people are visual people and some people are n't visual . They can talk about it , but they do n't see things at all in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Speed of Light 2000 , what people are looking at is something that has been changed by the speed of light .

" I really like to have their input . That 's only with commissions . MA : Is it difficult to part with work ? JR : It was in the beginning .

Sometimes , the best paintings are n't sold , they are not acknowledged , and you get them back because people do n't understand them . I feel very fortunate that people saved what I did , because then I have memories .
