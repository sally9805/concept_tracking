" But there 's got to be . " Maris Matherly-Reed impatiently tapped her pencil against the notepad upon which she had doodled a series of triangles and a chain of loops . Below those she 'd roughsketched an idea for a book jacket . " P.M.E. , correct ? " " Correct . " " I 'm sorry , ma'am , there 's no such listing . I doublechecked . " The idea for the book jacketan autobiographical account of the author 's murky relationship with her stepsiblinghad come to Maris while she was waiting for the directory assistance operator to locate the telephone number . A call that should have taken no more than a few seconds had stretched into several minutes . " You do n't have a listing for P.M.E. in this area code ? " " In any area code , " the operator replied . " I 've accessed the entire U.S. " " Maybe it 's a business listing , not a residential . " " I checked both . " " Could it be an unlisted number ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything under those initials , period . If you had a last name " " But I do n't . " " Then I 'm sorry . " " Thank you for trying . " Frustrated , Maris reconsidered her sketch , then scribbled over it . She was n't going to like that book no matter what the jacket looked like . The incestuous overtones made her uncomfortable , and she was afraid a large number of readers would share her uneasiness . But the editor to whom the manuscript had been submitted felt strongly about buying it . The subject matter guaranteed author appearances on TV and radio talk shows , writeups in magazines , probably a movie-of-the-week option . Even if the reviews were poor , the book 's subject matter was titillating enough to generate sales in large numbers . The other decision makers in the hardcover division of Matherly Press had agreed with the editor when she pled her case , so Maris had deferred to the majority . They owed her one . Which brought her back to the prologue of Envy she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stack of unsolicited manuscripts . They had been occupying a shelf in her office for months , collecting dust until that unspecified day when her schedule permitted her to scan them before sending the anxious authors the standard rejection letter . Imagining their crushing disappointment when they read that impersonal and transparent kiss-off , she felt that each writer deserved at least a few minutes of her time . And there was always that outside , one-in-a-million , once-in-a blue-moon chance that the next Steinbeck or Faulkner or Hemingway would be mined from the slush pile . That , of course , was every book editor 's pipe dream . Maris would settle for finding a bestseller . These twelve pages of prologue had definite promise . They had excited Maris more than anything she had read recently , even material from her portfolio of published authors , and certainly more than anything she 'd read from fledgling novelists . It had piqued her curiosity , as a prologue or first chapter should . She was hooked , eager to know more , anxious to read the rest of the story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she wondered . Or at least outlined ? Was this the author 's first attempt at fiction writing ? Had he or she written in another genre ? What were his/her credentials ? Did he/she have any credentials ? There was nothing to indicate the writer 's gender , although her gut feeling said male . Hatch Walker 's internal dialogue rang true to his salty character and read like the language in which a man would think . The narrative was in keeping with the old sailor 's poetic , though warped , soul . But the pages had been sent by someone totally inexperienced and untutored on how to submit a manuscript to a prospective publisher . All the standard rules had been broken . An SASE for return mailing had n't been enclosed . It lacked a cover letter of introduction . There was no phone number , street address , post office box , or e-mail address . Only those three initials and the name of an island that Maris had never heard of . How did the writer hope to sell his manuscript if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mailing envelope was four months old . If the author had submitted the prologue to several publishers simultaneously , it might have already been bought . All the more reason to locate the writer as soon as possible . She was either wasting her time or she was on to something with potential . Whichever , she needed to know sooner rather than later . " You 're not ready ? " Noah appeared in her open office door wearing his Armani tuxedo . Maris said , " My , do n't you look handsome . " Glancing at her desk clock , she realized she had lost all track of time and that she was , indeed , running late . Raking her fingers through her hair , she gave a short , self-deprecating laugh . " I , on the other hand , am going to require some major renovation . Her husband of twenty-two months closed the door behind him and advanced into her corner office . He tossed a trade magazine onto her desk , then moved behind her chair and began massaging her neck and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her tension and fatigue . " Tough day ? " " Not all that bad , actually . Only one meeting this afternoon . Mostly I 've used today to clear some space in here . " She gestured toward the pile of rejected manuscripts awaiting removal . " You 've been reading the stuff in your slush pile ? Maris , really , " he chided lightly . " Why bother ? It 's a Matherly Press policy not to buy anything that is n't submitted by an agent . " " That 's the official company line , but since I 'm a Matherly , I can bend the rules if I wish . " " I 'm married to an anarchist , " he teased , bending down to kiss the side of her neck . " But if you 're planning an insurrection , could n't your cause be something that streamlines our operation , instead of one that consumes the valuable time of our publisher and senior vice president ? " " What an off-putting title , " she remarked with a slight shudder . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lozenges and wears sensible shoes . " Noah laughed . " It makes you sound powerful , which you are . And awfully busy , which you are . " " You failed to mention smart and sexy . " " Those are givens . Stop trying to change the subject . Why bother with the slush pile when even our most junior editors do n't ? " " Because my father taught me to honor anyone who attempted to write . Even if the individual 's talent is limited , his effort alone deserves some consideration . " " Far be it from me to dispute the venerable Daniel Matherly . " Despite Noah 's mild reproof , Maris intended to continue the practice of going through the slush pile . Even if it was a time consuming and unproductive task , it was one of the principles upon which a Matherly had founded the publishing house over a century ago . Noah could mock their archaic traditions be cause he had n't been born a Matherly . He was a member of the family by marriage , not blood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more relaxed attitude toward tradition . A Matherly 's blood was tinted with ink . An appreciation for it seemed to flow through the family 's veins . Maris firmly believed that her family 's admiration and respect for the written word and for writers had been fundamental to their success and longevity as publishers . " I got an advance copy of the article , " Noah said . She picked up the magazine he 'd carried in with him . A Post-It marked a specific page . Turning to it , she said , " Ah , great photo . " " Good photographer . " " Good subject . " " Thank you . " " ' Noah Reed is forty , but could pass for much younger , ' " she read aloud from the article . Angling her head back , she gave him a critical look . " I agree . You do n't look a day over thirty-nine . " " Haha .

Did you ever have a thing with her ? " He chuckled . " Absolutely not . " " She 's one of the few . " On their wedding day , Maris had teasingly remarked to him that so many single women were mourning the loss of one of the city 's most eligible bachelors , she was surprised that the doors of St. Patrick 's Cathedral were n't draped in black crepe . " Does she get around to mentioning your business acumen and the contributions you 've made to Matherly Press ? " " Farther down . " " Let 's see ...

' " Pleased , she smiled up at him . " Did you say that ? " " And more that she did n't include . " " Then thank you very much . " " I only said what I know to be true . " Maris read the remainder of the flattering article , then set the magazine aside . " Very nice . But for all her gaganess she overlooked two major biographical points . " " And they are ? " " That you 're also an excellent writer . " " The Vanquished is old news . " " But it should be mentioned anytime your name appears in print . " " What 's the second thing ? " he asked in the brusque tone he used whenever she brought up his one and only published novel . " She said nothing about your marvelous massage techniques . " " Happy to oblige . " Closing her eyes , Maris tilted her head to one side . " A little lower on your ... Ahh . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spot between her scapulas , and the tension began to dissolve . " You 're in knots , " he said . " Serves you right for scavenging through that heap of garbage all day . " " As it turns out , it might not have been time wasted . I actually found something that sparked my interest . " " You 're joking . " " No . " " Fiction or non ? " " Fiction . Only a prologue , but it 's intriguing . It starts " " I want to hear all about it , darling . But you really should shake a leg if we 're going to get there in time . " He dropped a kiss on the top of her head , then tried to withdraw . But Maris reached for his hands and pulled them over her shoulders , holding them flattened against her chest . " Is tonight mandatory ? " " More or less . " " We could miss one function , could n't we ? Dad begged off tonight . " " That 's why we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two empty seats would be noticeable . One of our authors is receiving an award . " " His agent and editor are attending with him . He wo n't be without a cheering section . " She pulled his hands down onto her breasts . " Let 's call in sick . Go home and shut out the world . Open a bottle of wine , the cheaper the better . Get in the Jacuzzi and feed each other a pizza . Make love in some room other than the bedroom . Maybe even two rooms . " Laughing , he squeezed her breasts affectionately . " What did you say this prologue was about ? " He pulled his hands from beneath hers and headed for the door . Maris groaned with disappointment . " I thought I was making you an offer you could n't refuse . " " Tempting . Very . But if we 're not at this dinner , it 'll arouse suspicion . " " You 're right . I 'd hate for people to think that we 're still acting like newlyweds who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But .... ? " " But we also have professional responsibilities , Maris . As you are well aware . It 's important for industry insiders to know that when they refer to Matherly Press , it damn well better be in either the present or future tense , not the past tense . " " And that 's why we attend nearly every publishing event held in New York , " she said as though it were part of a memorized catechism . " Precisely . " Their calendars were filled with breakfasts , luncheons , dinners , receptions , and cocktail parties . Noah believed it was extremely important , virtually compulsory , that they be seen as active participants within literary circles , especially since her father could no longer be involved to the extent he once had been . Recently Daniel Matherly had slowed down . He did n't attend as many insider gatherings . He was no longer accepting speaking engagements , although the requests still poured in . The Four Seasons was calling daily now to inquire if Daniel would be using his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat another party there . For almost five decades , Daniel had been a force to be reckoned with . Under his leadership , Matherly Press had set the industry standards , dictated trends , dominated the bestseller lists . His name had become synonymous with book publishing both domestically and in foreign markets . He had been a juggernaut who , over a period of months , had voluntarily been decreasing his momentum . However , his semi-retirement did not spell the end , or even a weakening , of the publishing house 's viability . Noah thought it was vitally important that the book publishing community understand that . If that meant going to award dinners several times a month , that 's what they would do . He checked his wristwatch . " How much time do you need ? I should let the driver know when we 'll be downstairs . " Maris sighed with resignation . " Give me twenty minutes . " " I 'll be generous . Take thirty . " He blew her a kiss before leaving . But Maris did n't plunge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her assistant to place a call . She 'd had another idea on how she might track down the author of Envy . While waiting for the requested call to be placed , she gazed out her office windows . Extending nearly from floor to ceiling , they formed a corner of the room , providing her a southeastern exposure . Midtown Manhattan was experiencing a mild summer evening . The sun had slipped behind the skyscrapers , casting a premature twilight on the streets below . Already lights were coming on inside buildings , making the brick and granite structures appear to twinkle . Through the windows of neighboring buildings , Maris could see other professionals wrapping up for the day . The avenues were jammed with competing after-work and pretheater traffic . Taxies vied for inches of space , nosing themselves into impossibly small channels between buses and delivery trucks . Couriers on bicycles , seemingly with death wishes , perilously played chicken with motor traffic . Revolving doors disgorged pedestrians onto the crowded sidewalks , where they jostled for space and wielded briefcases and shopping bags like weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forming outside Radio City Music Hall , where Tony Bennett was performing this evening . She , Noah , and her father had been offered complimentary VIP tickets , but they 'd had to decline them because of the literary award banquet . Which she should be dressing for , she reminded herself , just as her telephone beeped . " He 's on line one , " her assistant informed her . " Thanks . You do n't need to wait . See you tomorrow . " Maris depressed the blinking button . " Hello ? " " Yeah . Deputy Dwight Harris here . " " Hello , Deputy Harris . Thank you for taking my call . My name is Maris MatherlyReed . " " Say again ? " She did . " Uhhuh . " Maris paused , giving him time to comment or ask a question , but he did n't , so she went straight to the reason for the call . " I 'm trying to reach someone , an individual who I believe lives on St. Anne Island . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , ma'am , " he proudly replied . " Is St. Anne actually an island ? " " Not much o ' one . What I mean is , it 's small . But it 's an island , awright . Little less than two miles out from the mainland . Who 're you looking for ? " " Someone with the initials P.M.E. " " Did you say P.M.E. ? " " Have you ever heard of anyone who goes by those initials ? " " Ca n't say that I have , ma'am . We talking about a man or woman ? " " Unfortunately , I do n't know . " " You do n't know . Huh . " After a beat or two , the deputy asked , " If you do n't even know if it 's a man or woman , what do you want with ' em ? " " It 's business . " " Business . " " That 's right . " " Huh . " Dead end . Maris tried again . " I thought you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nope . " This was going nowhere and her allotted time was running out . " Well , thank you for your time , Deputy Harris . I 'm sorry to have bothered you . " " No bother . " " Would you mind taking down my name and numbers ? Then if you think of something or hear of someone with these initials , I would appreciate being notified . " After she gave him her telephone numbers , he said , " Say , ma'am ? If it 's back child support or an outstanding arrest warrant or something like ' at , I 'd be happy to see if " " No , no . It 's not a legal matter in any sense . " " Business . " " That 's right . " " Well , okay , then , " he said with noticeable disappointment . " Sorry I could n't he'p you . " She thanked him again , then closed her office and hurried down the hallway to the ladies ' room , where her cocktail dress had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Because she frequently changed from business to evening attire before leaving the building , she kept a full complement of toiletries and cosmetics in a locker . She put them to use now . When she joined Noah at the elevator fifteen minutes later , he gave a long wolf whistle , then kissed her cheek . " Nice turnaround . A miracle , actually . You look fantastic . " As they descended to street level , she assessed her reflection in the metal elevator door and realized that her efforts had n't been in vain . " Fantastic , " was a slight exaggeration , but considering the dishevelment she 'd started with , she looked better than she had any right to expect . She 'd chosen to wear a cranberrycolored silk sheath with narrow straps and a scooped neckline . Her nod toward evening glitter came in the form of diamond studs in her ears and a crystal-encrusted Judith Leiber handbag in the shape of a butterfly , a Christmas gift from her father . She was carrying a pashmina shawl purchased in Paris during a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had gathered her shoulder-length hair into a sleek , low ponytail . The hairdo looked chic and sophisticated rather than desperate , which had been the case . She had retouched her eye makeup , outlined her lips with a pencil , and filled them in with gloss . To give color to her fluorescent-light pallor , she had applied powdered bronzer to her cheeks , chin , forehead , and dcolletage . Her push-up bra , an engineering marvel , had created a flattering cleavage that filled up the neckline of her dress . " ' Her tan and tits were store-bought . ' " The elevator doors opened onto the ground floor . Noah looked at her curiously as he stepped aside to let her exit ahead of him . " I beg your pardon ? " She laughed softly . " Nothing . Just quoting something I read today . "
