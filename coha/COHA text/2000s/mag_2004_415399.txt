In England 's scenic southwest county , a historic estate has opened its doors as a luxury hotel . BY ANTHONY GARDNER // Dartmoor National Park , in the southwest corner of England , is one of the most dramatic and least spoiled parts of the British Isles . On a sunny day its moors , hills , rivers and rocky peaks exude an ancient magic ; when the mist gathers , you understand why Sir Arthur Conan Doyle chose to set The Hound of the Baskervilles there . Now this magical landscape serves as backdrop for an appropriately fanciful five-star hotel-the recently opened Bovey Castle . A sixty-five-bedroom baronial fantasy , the granite " castle " is more accurately an Edwardian manor whose architect got carried away and embellished it with battlements , pinnacles and gargoyles . It was built for Viscount Hambledon , a member of the W. H. Smith retailing dynasty , but in the 1920s it was converted into a sister hotel to Scotland 's fabled Glencagles and Turnberry resorts , and a golf course to rival theirs was laid out . A wing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finished . In the decades that followed , the hotel changed hands with depressing regularity . At the beginning of last year the British entrepreneur Peter de Savary bought it , and he has since spent $50 million to turn it into a country retreat , with the emphasis decidedly on " treat . " De Savary is best known for the opulent , impeccably tasteful clubs he has created around the world , among them , the Carnegie ( Hub at Skibo Castle in Scotland ( which he sold to a group of its members last year ) and Carnegie Abbey , near Newport , Rhode Island . Dovey Castle is a departure in that it is first and foremost a hotel , though it is also possible to buy a Founder membership , which entitles you to use one of twenty-two luxury lodges being built on the grounds . The rest of the world must make do with extremely comfortable bedrooms , sumptuous dining and drawing rooms , a brand-new spa , gym and indoor pool as well as 500 gorgeous acres encompassing gardens , a golf course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifty miles southwest of London , Bovey is most easily reached by making a two-hour train journey to Exeter , followed by a half-hour drive . The narrow country road-bordered in early summer by trees heavy with blossoms-winds up steep hills and down through idyllic small valleys where sheep and lambs graze peacefully . Passing under the noble gaze of 15th-century Moretonhampstead Church , you reach a handsome gate lodge , from which you set out on a mile-long drive through undulating parkland to the hotel itself . In the courtyard , porters in tweed waistcoats and plus fours lurk like extras from Gosford Park , primed to whisk your portmanteaus and traveling trunks up to your room . Although Bovey was built in 1906 , the revamped interior owes more to the Jazz Age-when the castle was incredibly popular-favoring Art Deco touches and bright colors throughout . The walls are decorated with Tamara de Lempicka portraits and fashion plates of flappers ; the Palm Court restaurant gleams with mirrored pillars and silk chinoiserie wallpaper ; the bathrooms have zebra-striped walls and chrome fittings . The heart of the hotel is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and thirty-foot-tall stone fireplace carved with coats of arms . The Adam Room is a light , airy parlor with intricate classical stucco work , while the library and billiard rooms are havens for bookish and sporting guests respectively . The staff members at Bovey are friendly and efficient , but they also know when to leave you in peace , and it is easy to find a quiet corner where you can relax without feeling self-conscious . Coming down to breakfast on my first morning , I was surprised to find a man with a fierce-looking bird on his arm standing at the bottom of the stairs . He was the hotel falconer , who gives a display every morning with half a dozen birds of prey . To watch them swoop down from the balustraded terrace across the sloping lawn to the river and ornamental lake beyond and then rise against the wooded hills is to feel enthralled and awestruck by an exhibition of deadly grace and power . Outdoor activities , from croquet to pheasant shooting , are an essential part of Bovey 's appeal . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ range . As for the golf course , it is short ( 6,303 yards ) but challenging , with the Bovey and Bowden rivers framing nine of the eighteen holes . Those who can not tell a wedge from a niblick may enjoy the castle 's Edwardian gardens with their brilliant rhododendrons and azaleas and magnificent trees , including weeping beeches and Japanese maples . Beyond the estate are 365 square miles of national park to explore , with wild ponies , moorland expanses , small villages and such legendary estates as Sir Edwin Lutyens 's Castle Drogo.The sea is half an hour 's drive away , and the hotel keeps a classic launch on the River Dart for amphibious picnicking . When it rains , there is the spa to repair to , with its sixty-five-foot-long indoor swimming pool and a well-equipped fitness center . ( I enjoyed a full-body massage , which made smooth cords of my deeply knotted muscles . ) The Children 's Barn brims with games , and the hotel also has a movie theater and the Devon Long House , where you can be instructed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's even a smoke-house on the property , where fishermen can turn their catch into dinner . The castle has two dining rooms : the Palm Court and the informal Clubhouse . You can also eat on the terrace , and the billiard room and the wine cellar are available for private dining . According to executive chef David Berry , Britain 's best organic suppliers are found in Devon , so the menu is based on local produce and includes dishes like a tian of Teignmouth lobster with caviar crme frache , moorland game terrine with tomato compote and a comforting " adult nursery dish of the day " ( cottage pic , for example ) . I found the food met a consistently high standard , without being in quite the same league as that served at Skibo Castle . My one regret was that I was not able to spend more time in my room , which was spacious , beautiful and equipped with an elaborately carved mantelpiece and elegant reproduction 1920s and ' 30s furniture . The bed was canopied , the sofa and armchairs were invitations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prints and . 1920s Vogue covers ; the only nods to modernity were the flat-screen television and the CD system . The marbled , high-ceilinged bathroom was also on a grand scale , with a wood-paneled bath incorporating a powerful shower . The best rooms are the ones at the front , with views over the lakes and the valley . These include three spectacular suites that have been created in a new wing above the swimming pool and the golf clubhouse , the largest being the 2,500-square-foot Chairman 's Suite . In the new wing of the castle , the perfectly situated Easdon room-once Viscount Hambledon 's chambers-has a splendid marble fireplace and an antique desk , and the Paton Snug is charming , suitable for a family , with a little bedroom alcove perfect for a child . The hotel 's guests are largely London-based financiers and their families , as well as passengers from the Queen Mary 2 , who come here from Southampton , just two and a half hours away . To say that Bovey does not have the same magic as Skibo Castle is hardly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The advantage of Bovey is that you can visit it more than once without having to become a member . Its atmosphere is a blend of the sophisticated and relaxed that is rarely achieved in Britain-and all in all the experience is hard to fault . At a time when others are busily reinventing their country-house hotels by filling them with funky furniture , Bovey Castle is a glorious reminder of just how good the old-fashioned kind can be .
