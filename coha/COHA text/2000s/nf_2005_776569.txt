Prologue // If I knew anything about Sigmund Freud and psychoanalysis I 'd be able to trace all my troubles to my miserable childhood in Ireland . That miserable childhood deprived me of self-esteem , triggered spasms of self pity , paralyzed my emotions , made me cranky , envious and disrespectful of authority , retarded my development , crippled my doings with the opposite sex , kept me from rising in the world and made me unfit , almost , for human society . How I became a teacher at all and remained one is a miracle and I have to give myself full marks for surviving all those years in the classrooms of New York . There should be a medal for people who survive miserable childhoods and become teachers , and I should be first in line for the medal and whatever bars might be appended for ensuing miseries. // I could lay blame . The miserable childhood does n't simply happen . It is brought about . There are dark forces . If I am to lay blame it is in a spirit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pius XII ; the English in general and King George VI in particular ; Cardinal MacRory , who ruled Ireland when I was a child ; the bishop of Limerick , who seemed to think everything was sinful ; Eamonn De Valera , former prime minister ( Taoiseach ) and president of Ireland . Mr. De Valera was a half-Spanish Gaelic fanatic ( Spanish onion in an Irish stew ) who directed teachers all over Ireland to beat the native tongue into us and natural curiosity out of us . He caused us hours of misery . He was aloof and indifferent to the black and blue welts raised by schoolmaster sticks on various parts of our young bodies . I forgive , also , the priest who drove me from the confessional when I admitted to sins of self-abuse and self-pollution and penny thieveries from my mother 's purse . He said I did not show a proper spirit of repentance , especially in the matter of the flesh . And even though he had hit that nail right on the head , his refusal to grant me absolution put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flattened by a truck outside the church he would have been responsible for my eternal damnation . I forgive various bullying schoolmasters for pulling me out of my seat by the sideburns , for walloping me regularly with stick , strap and cane when I stumbled over answers in the catechism or when in my head I could n't divide 937 by 739 . I was told by my parents and other adults it was all for my own good . I forgive them for those whopping hypocrisies and wonder where they are at this moment . Heaven ? Hell ? Purgatory ( if it still exists ) ? // I can even forgive myself , though when I look back at various stages of my life , I groan . What an ass . What timidities . What stupidities . What indecisions and flounderings. // But then I take another look . I had spent childhood and adolescence examining my conscience and finding myself in a perpetual state of sin . That was the training , the brainwashing , the conditioning and it discouraged smugness , especially among the sinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself credit for at least one virtue : doggedness . Not as glamorous as ambition or talent or intellect or charm , but still the one thing that got me through the days and nights . // F. Scott Fitzgerald said that in American lives there are no second acts . He simply did not live long enough . In my case he was wrong . // When I taught in New York City high schools for thirty years no one but my students paid me a scrap of attention . In the world outside the school I was invisible . Then I wrote a book about my childhood and became mick of the moment . I hoped the book would explain family history to McCourt children and grandchildren . I hoped it might sell a few hundred copies and I might be invited to have discussions with book clubs . Instead it jumped onto the best-seller list and was translated into thirty languages and I was dazzled . The book was my second act . // In the world of books I am a late bloomer , a johnny-come-lately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angela 's Ashes , was published in 1996 when I was sixty-six , the second , ' T is , in 1999 when I was sixty-nine . At that age it 's a wonder I was able to lift the pen at all . New friends of mine ( recently acquired because of my ascension to the best-seller lists ) had published books in their twenties . Striplings. // So , what took you so long ? // I was teaching , that 's what took me so long . Not in college or university , where you have all the time in the world for writing and other diversions , but in four different New York City public high schools . ( I have read novels about the lives of university professors where they seemed to be so busy with adultery and academic in-fighting you wonder where they found time to squeeze in a little teaching . ) When you teach five high school classes a day , five days a week , you 're not inclined to go home to clear your head and fashion deathless prose . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clamor of the classroom . // I never expected Angela 's Ashes to attract any attention , but when it hit the best-seller lists I became a media darling . I had my picture taken hundreds of times . I was a geriatric novelty with an Irish accent . I was interviewed for dozens of publications . I met governors , mayors , actors . I met the first President Bush and his son the governor of Texas . I met President Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton . I met Gregory Peck . I met the Pope and kissed his ring . Sarah , Duchess of York , interviewed me . She said I was her first Pulitzer Prize winner . I said she was my first duchess . She said , Ooh , and asked the cameraman , Did you get that ? Did you get that ? I was nominated for a Grammy for the spoken word and nearly met Elton John . People looked at me in a different way . They said , Oh , you wrote that book , This way , please , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything ? A woman in a coffee shop squinted and said , I seen you on TV . You must be important . Who are you ? Could I have your autograph ? I was listened to . I was asked for my opinion on Ireland , conjunctivitis , drinking , teeth , education , religion , adolescent angst , William Butler Yeats , literature in general . What books are you reading this summer ? What books have you read this year ? Catholicism , writing , hunger . I spoke to gatherings of dentists , lawyers , ophthalmologists and , of course , teachers . I traveled the world being Irish , being a teacher , an authority on misery of all kinds , a beacon of hope to senior citizens everywhere who always wanted to tell their stories . // They made a movie of Angela 's Ashes . No matter what you write in America there is always talk of The Movie . You could write the Manhattan telephone directory , and they 'd say , So , when is the movie ? // If I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Just one more year , God , just one more year because this book is the one thing I want to do in my life , what 's left of it . I never dreamed it would be a best-seller . I hoped it would sit on booksellers ' shelves while I lurked in the bookshop and watched beautiful women turn pages and shed the occasional tear . They 'd buy the book , of course , take it home , loll on divans and read my story while sipping herbal tea or a fine sherry . They 'd order copies for all their friends . // In ' T is I wrote about my life in America and how I became a teacher . After it was published I had the nagging feeling I 'd given teaching short shrift . In America , doctors , lawyers , generals , actors , television people and politicians are admired and rewarded . Not teachers . Teaching is the downstairs maid of professions . Teachers are told to use the service door or go around the back . They are congratulated on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are spoken of patronizingly and patted , retroactively , on their silvery locks . Oh , yes , I had an English teacher , Miss Smith , who really inspired me . I 'll never forget dear old Miss Smith . She used to say that if she reached one child in her forty years of teaching it would make it all worthwhile . She 'd die happy . The inspiring English teacher then fades into gray shadows to eke out her days on a penny-pinching pension , dreaming of the one child she might have reached . Dream on , teacher . You will not be celebrated . // You think you 'll walk into the classroom , stand a moment , wait for silence , watch while they open notebooks and click pens , tell them your name , write it on the board , proceed to teach . // On your desk you have the English course of study provided by the school . You 'll teach spelling , vocabulary , grammar , reading comprehension , composition , literature . // You ca n't wait to get to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plays , essays , novels , short stories . The hands of one hundred and seventy students will quiver in the air and they 'll call out , Mr. McCourt , me , me , I wan na say something . // You hope they 'll want to say something . You do n't want them to sit gawking while you struggle to keep a lesson alive . // You 'll feast on the bodies of English and American literature . What a time you 'll have with Carlyle and Arnold , Emerson and Thoreau . You ca n't wait to get to Shelley , Keats and Byron and good old Walt Whitman . Your classes will love all that romanticism and rebellion , all that defiance . You 'll love it yourself , because , deep down and in your dreams , you 're a wild romantic . You see yourself on the barricades . // Principals and other figures of authority passing in the hallways will hear sounds of excitement from your room . They 'll peer through the door window in wonder at all the raised hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys and girls , these plumbers , electricians , beauticians , carpenters , mechanics , typists , machinists . // You 'll be nominated for awards : Teacher of the Year , Teacher of the Century . You 'll be invited to Washington . Eisenhower will shake your hand . Newspapers will ask you , a mere teacher , for your opinion on education . This will be big news : A teacher asked for his opinion on education . Wow . You 'll be on television . // Television . // Imagine : A teacher on television . // They 'll fly you to Hollywood , where you 'll star in movies about your own life . Humble beginnings , miserable childhood , problems with the church ( which you bravely defied ) , images of you solitary in a corner , reading by candlelight : Chaucer , Shakespeare , Austen , Dickens . You there in the corner blinking with your poor diseased eyes , bravely reading till your mother pulls the candle away from you , tells you if you do n't stop the two eyes will fall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candle back , you have only a hundred pages left in Dombey and Son , and she says , No , I do n't want to be leading you around Limerick with people asking how you went blind when a year ago you were kicking a ball with the best of them . // You say yes to your mother because you know the song : // A mother 's love is a blessing // No matter where you go // Keep her while you have her // You 'll miss her when she 's gone . // Besides , you could never talk back to a movie mother played by one of those old Irish actresses , Sarah Allgood or Una O'Connor , with their sharp tongues and their suffering faces . Your own mother had a powerful hurt look , too , but there 's nothing like seeing it on the big screen in black and white or living color . // Your father could be played by Clark Gable except that a ) he might not be able to handle your father 's North of Ireland accent and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With the Wind , which , you remember , was banned in Ireland because , it is said , Rhett Butler carried his own wife , Scarlett , up the stairs and into bed , which upset the film censors in Dublin and caused them to ban the film entirely . No , you 'd need someone else as your father because the Irish censors would be watching closely and you 'd be badly disappointed if the people in Limerick , your city , and the rest of Ireland were denied the opportunity of seeing the story of your miserable childhood and subsequent triumph as teacher and movie star . // But that would not be the end of the story . The real story would be how you eventually resisted the siren call of Hollywood , how after nights of being dined , wined , feted and lured to the beds of female stars , established and aspiring , you discovered the hollowness of their lives , how they poured out their hearts to you on various satin pillows , how you listened , with twinges of guilt , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of your devotion to your students , had become an idol and an icon in Hollywood , how they , the ravishing female stars , established and aspiring , regretted how they had gone astray , embracing the emptiness of their Hollywood lives when , if they gave it all up , they could rejoice daily in the integrity of teaching the future craftsmen , tradesmen and clerk-typists of America . How it must feel , they would say , to wake up in the morning , to leap gladly from the bed , knowing that before you stretched a day in which you 'd do God 's work with the youth of America , content with your meager remuneration , your real reward the glow of gratitude in the eager eyes of your students as they bear gifts from their grateful and admiring parents : cookies , bread , homemade pasta and the occasional bottle of wine from the backyard vines of Italian families , the mothers and fathers of your one hundred and seventy students at McKee Vocational and Technical High School , Borough of Staten Island , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
