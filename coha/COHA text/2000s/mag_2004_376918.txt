Every morning 24-year-old Shahida Begum leaves her home in a Dhaka slum , wends her way through a posh diplomatic enclave and turns up for work at a garment factory overlooking the U.S. embassy . It 's a commute she may not be making much longer . Like most of Bangladesh 's 1.8 million textile workers , she has heard rumors that next year the American and European companies that buy clothes from her country will switch to Chinese manufacturers , leading to a shutdown of garment factories in Dhaka . The zero-sum math of globalization makes little sense to one of its potential victims . " How can the Chinese make clothes more cheaply than we do , " asks Begum , " when I get paid so little ? " <P> What could be impending catastrophe for Begum means relief for Susheil Joshi . Behind him in his Hong Kong office , Joshi  --  one of those who will help decide the fate of Begum and many like her next year  --  has a color-coded map of the world , with 36 countries highlighted . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the merchandise that the Children 's Place , a North American chain of affordable-clothing stores , sells in America . <P> Joshi does not enjoy his packed travel schedule . But a system of quotas  --  originally put in place in 1974 to regulate a $350 billion-a-year global industry  --  limits the number of shirts , towels and other textiles any country can export annually to the U.S. and the European Union . As a result , the Children 's Place  --  and every other American retailer  --  ca n't buy exclusively from the countries that make them most efficiently and cheaply , such as China , but must also order from less competitive places , such as Burma and Swaziland . " It 's crazy : 80% of our clothing comes from 20% of the countries , " says Joshi . " But we need to go to all these places because of the quota system . " <P> On Dec. 31 the craziness will come to an end . That 's when a 1995 trade pact called the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing , signed by members of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to quotas  --  and buyers like Joshi will be free to find the best deals anywhere they can . Ghulam Faruq , a Bangladeshi textile exporter , says American and European companies that now buy from about 60 countries might source from only 20 by 2006 and fewer than 10 by 2010 . China is expected to be the biggest beneficiary . <P> For smaller developing countries that depend heavily on textile manufacturing , the end of quotas could be a dire economic blow . In 2002 , for example , quotas on some items , including gloves and negligees , were lifted by the U.S. By 2003 , Chinese exports of those goods had leaped nearly 200% from their 2001 levels , while Sri Lanka 's exports had dropped more than 50% and Bangladesh 's had fallen 46% . If history repeats , millions of people could be thrown out of work in some of the world 's poorest and most politically volatile countries  --  and in the richest nations as well . On Oct. 12 a coalition of U.S. textile manufacturers and labor groups , claiming that thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade restrictions on imports of Chinese-made trousers , cotton shirts and other goods . The government has agreed to consider the request .
