Judge Jackson , your honor , Microsoft would like to enter into the record the exhibit marked " AOL Time Warner . " <P> Though Microsoft 's lawyers have n't had a chance to make that statement yet , company spokesmen did ballyhoo the AOL-Time Warner deal as proof that the high-tech industries in which Microsoft competes  --  unfairly , according to the Justice Department  --  are evolving so quickly and convulsively that to assert Microsoft exerts monopolistic power is " almost comical . " <P> Yet sources close to the government reported that Justice is still not amused . Throughout last week , the feds continued to favor the most draconian of penalties for Microsoft : a breakup of the software giant . The AOL-Time Warner merger may have altered the landscape today , the reasoning goes , but the government 's antitrust case is built around events that happened in 1994 and 1995 . Microsoft 's business practices back then  --  stifling competition and bullying clients when it had market-share dominance  --  are the issue , not the company 's position in today 's media world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made last week : Microsoft founder and chairman Bill Gates relinquished the title of CEO . Steve Ballmer , 43 , president since 1998 , was named to replace him . " Gates ' sidestepping helps a little bit , " says George Washington University law professor William Kovacic , " to the extent you change the face you have to deal with . Nobody speaks of Ballmer as the villain . " <P> Both Gates and Ballmer emphasized Microsoft 's identity as a software company , rather than , say , as a content and Internet company like AOL Time Warner . The word content , which figured prominently in Microsoft pronouncements and acquisitions just a few months ago , was barely uttered . " Software is our heritage , and it 's our future , " said Ballmer . " Our plan is to develop a new software-services platform that will ignite opportunities for partners around the world . " Microsoft , by developing what it calls Next Generation Windows Services  --  software that will shift applications such as databases and word processing from your computer to a server @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also the business model that can carry the company into a divested or undivested future . Just as you would have to visit AOL Time Warner to access its content , you will have to hit , or subscribe to , Microsoft 's sites to use its services . <P> If Microsoft can succeed in coming up with its own protected , pervasive network architecture  --  a computer-instruction language linking everything from wireless devices to kitchen appliances to PCs  --  then the company could dominate the network with NGWS in the same way it has ruled the desktop with Windows . <P> That may be Microsoft 's greatest challenge to date  --  and exactly what Justice wants to thwart . " For Microsoft to come in and impose proprietary source codes will be very difficult , " says Dan Kusnetzky of International Data Corp . <P> Figuring how to beat the competition without setting off the alarm at Justice is the job of Microsoft 's newly appointed chief software architect . His name : Bill Gates .               @ @ @ @ @ @
