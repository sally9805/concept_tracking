The psychotherapist , a friendly woman with wire-screwy hair that wafted in a cloud around her face , offered her hand at their first session , introduced herself as Shaun Gould , and asked , " Why are you here ? " " My dog died and now Im so lonely its driving me crazy . " His directness brought her forward in the chair , and she said , " Im very sorry you lost your dog . That must have hurt you . " " Yes . " " Did you know you were lonely before the dog died ? " " No . But I know now . " " What do you know about it ? " Shaun asked , and the question bore just exactly the right ring of interest , nothing feigned or enacted . As she listened to his answer , he studied her comforting body , its thick waist and generous curves lounging in the black leather chair . He told her about breaking up with his current girlfriend , and he told about breaking up with the previous girlfriends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he got a sick feeling in the pit of his stomach , and finally he said , " But thats not what I want to talk about . " " I did nt think it was , " Shaun said . " I want to tell you about Allen , " Ford said . " And then I want to tell you about McKenzie . " He expected to tell the story with detachment , but failed . He stopped talking and waited , shivering . Shaun listened with occasional changes of expression , small nods , and careful encouragements for him to continue . He told about the dog and McKenzie , and those months in Chapel Hill when he had been with them both . He trembled , but Shaun sat calmly , hands folded in her lap . When he said , " But he never came back to get the dog , andso I kept him , " and then fell silent , Shaun sat motionless . Finally nodding once . " Why did you tell me that ? " she asked . " To tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ? " " That I must have cared about him a lot . " " That you must have ? " He thought carefully . " That I did . I cared about him . More than I cared about anybody else that I can think of . " Ford visited Shaun once a week for a period of several months . While he declined to discuss these sessions with his parents , they were relieved to note he had regained his weight and color . He slept well , after the first few weeks . Returning to the empty house no longer paralyzed him . Abandoning the image of himself floating above himself , he caressed the physical objects around him , the exquisite antiques that had belonged to his Great-grandmother Bondurant , the Waterford vase full of silk daisies , the stainless frame of the Matisse print over the Victorian sofa . At the hospital , he proved himself to be a better prospect as a pediatrician than many would have guessed , moving with authority from nursing unit to clinic exam room , charismatic , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even after thirty-six- and forty-eight-hour shifts , Ford remained even-tempered and clear-headed , proving his value repeatedly . " Why do you want to be a doctor ? " Shaun asked , in late September . " I do nt know , " Ford answered , " I never really thought about it . " " Youre working very hard to become something , and you do nt know why you want to be that something ? " Ford enjoyed the game of framing his answers in words that Shaun would allow . " I want to be a doctor because my father was a doctor and my grandfather was a doctor . I never really thought about my own reasons . It was enough to think about my father and my grandfather . " " Do nt you think you should do a little thinking about what you want ? " " I guess I already have . Because Im going into pediatrics . My father wasnt too happy about that because pediatricians do nt have the same prestige that surgeons do . Do nt make as much money . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the whole business with the dog . " " Do you think theres any connection between the two things ? " " You mean , the fact that Im going to keep disappointing my father for a good while to come ? " Shaun fingered the plain gold band that she wore on her right hand . " Thats one way to look at it . But I think it might be healthier just to think of it as one more step toward honesty with your parents . With both of them . Your mother is involved in all this , too . " Honesty . With the white house , the cool rooms , the yard filled with oleander , the Vietnamese gardener moving among the blossoms . Honesty with the cool china , the polished silver , the framed pictures of parents , grandparents , great-grandparents , collateral couples , the great paired beings of his past . " I know what youre trying to say , Shaun . But it does nt matter what I call it , honesty or anything else . My dads going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family , in Savannah , you get married . You just do it . No matter what . Im already late . " By early fall , his parents concern over his matrimonial future became acute . At dinner with his father one evening , the two of them supping in the elegant affiliated mens business club ( which remained a mens club even though women occasionally won membership ) , Dr. McKinney Sr. brought up Fords old girlfriend , Haviland Barrows , who had recently married Red Fisher , one of Fords high school acquaintances . " Settled right down in the historic district in a little stoop cottage . Renovated beautifully , right out of a textbook . I do nt think thats such a bad way to start out . " Father dabbed his lips with the napkin , preparing to engage his almond torte . " Of course , hell get the Jones Street house when his grandfather dies . Your uncle Hubert drew up that will . God knows what she gets . Some of the Barrows do nt have a cent , from what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ford said , signaling the waiter to bring more coffee . " She deserves it . " " I never did understand how you let her get away , son , " Father said . " It was easy , " Ford answered . " In fact , I wonder if Im likely to get married at all . " " What are you talking about ? Of course youll marry . Your mother and I wonder why its taken you this long . " " If its taken this long , " Ford said , " that has to be because Ive wanted it that way . " " Nonsense . First you had to get through medical school . Thats what weve always expected . " Dr. McKinney adjusted his collar . Ford spooned his own torte . " But now youre out of medical school , and its time to think about your future . Youre going to be a busy man , and you need someone to take care of you at home . " " You got married when you were in medical school . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were coming up , people got married when they were younger . These days its better to wait , the way you have . But you do have to stop waiting sometime . " His father laughed , self-consciously , underlining the jovial atmosphere he attempted to create for serious discussions . " I do nt think Im waiting . " Ford spoke with all the finality he could muster . " Ive had plenty of chances . I do nt think I want to get married . " " You cant possibly be serious . " " I can . " Folding his napkin and laying it on the corner of the table . His father paused , then changed the subject to the politics of Emory University Medical School , the appointment of yet another dean . " This one may be worse than the last one , " Father said . " We do nt know if this one can even function with a " falling suddenly silent . " You do nt know if he can what ? " Ford asked . " Well , anyway , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what about Dean Rouse ? " Ford asked . " What are your buddies at the club saying about him ? " " Just idle talk , " Father said uncomfortably . " Did you know he s a bachelor ? " Ford asked , after a moment . " Why , yes . I did hear that . " But his face was set as stone , and Ford watched him carefully . Frost settled over the table , covering their dinnerware and the remains of the dessert . Ford sipped his coffee . Later they discussed his trust funds and other financial matters . Ford asked after his mother . Father answered that she was well . The conversation cooled even further , and the two men parted company in the porte cochere as the liveried driver handed Father the keys to his vintage Mercedes . At the last moment , the elder doctor said to the younger , " Do nt forget we talked , Ford . You need to think about what youre doing . Youve come through a bad time , and I think all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of you . You need a wife . " " Im thinking about all that , Father . " The two shook hands , and in his fathers eyes glimmered ghost lights of real affection , sodden and held back . ***** At about the same time , while awaiting an appointment with his chief of service , Dr. Milliken , Ford chanced to read a memorandum posted in the Department of Pediatrics office suite . The memorandum , like others layered on top of it on the bulletin board , might have merited little of Fords attention , being unremarkablebut it was signed by someone in administration named Dan Crell . The signature itched at Ford for a few moments before he remembered the Christmas concert , the eerie voice , and the name on the concert program . At the end of September , Ford rotated out of Grady for two months of training at Egleston , another of the teaching hospitals that Emory staffed . By the time he returned to Grady , in December , with the hospital adorned in poinsettias and decorated doors , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But one morning early in the month , he became aware of someone watching him from the back of a nearly empty elevator . Since he was ultimately headed for the operating room , Ford wore the green surgical scrubs that are ubiquitous in hospitals ; the particular suit Ford had scrounged fit him snugly , the shoulders somewhat narrower than his own . The short sleeves rode high on his shoulders , and apparently the young man at the back of the elevator found the sight of Fords shoulders irresistible . Nothing new . Ford turned a little and allowed himself to return the mans gaze coolly . But the face shocked him . Recognition came at once . Ford looked for the mans identification badge and saw it hanging from the pocket of his shirt . Mr. Crell noted the motion , and this discomfited Ford somewhat . He felt suddenly naked in the green scrubs . But he met the mans gaze again . This time Mr. Crell averted his eyes , as if shy . The moment gave Ford an interval in which to study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soft at once . The face broadcast innocence , as if a child were entombed in it . The face as a whole shimmered from awkwardness to moments of grace . Or seemed to , until the young man met Fords gaze again . " This is our floor , " said Crells companion , a nurse whom Ford had failed to notice . " I guess Im falling asleep , " Crell said , " its all those late nights , " easing away from the elevator door . Even in those few words Ford could hear the singer in Dans voice , the rich soothing undertone that , for a moment , filled the elevator car . That was it , or so Ford thought . But as the elevator doors began to close , the man looked back at Ford . They simply watched each other , and the door closed , and that was that .
