My sister Elizabeth came to see me . Elizabeth is three years older than I am . We are n't close . We had spent too much of our childhood fighting over Daddy ever to be the kind of sisters that talk on the phone every day . To cement my conviction that Elizabeth was a pain , my dog , Rosie , did n't like her either . Since Rosie likes everyone , including armed intruders , it seemed clear that Elizabeth was special . " What kind is she again ? " Elizabeth said . " A Boston terrier ? " " Bull terrier , " I said . " Rosie is a miniature bull terrier . " " I thought she was a Boston terrier . " " You want to see her papers , " I said . " Oh , are n't you funny , " Elizabeth said . We were having coffee at the counter in my kitchen without Rosie , who had left us and was on my bed at the other end of the loft , watching us carefully with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South Boston ? " I said . " Is this really South Boston ? " Elizabeth said . " The yuppie part , " I said . " Oh . . . this coffee is very good . " " Starbucks , " I said . " What is it ? " " Starbucks , " I said . " This particular one is from Guatemala . " " Oh , write that down for me , will you ? " " Sure . " I wrote Starbucks Coffee on a piece of notepaper and gave it to her . She stuffed it into her purse . I waited . She sipped some coffee . I looked at Rosie . Rosie 's tail stirred . But she did n't change her mind about staying on the bed . " Do you ever see your ex-husband ? " Elizabeth said . " Richie and I see each other every Wednesday night . " " Do you do anything ? " " Do anything ? ' " You know , " Elizabeth said , " sex . It 's all right to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess it 's all right for me to say none of your business . " " Oh do n't be so silly , " Elizabeth said . " Do you date other men ? " " Yes . " " And ? " " Elizabeth , what the hell are we talking about here ? " " For God 's sake , I 'm just asking if you have sex . " " None of your business . Do I ask you about your sex life ? " " Oh , me , I 'm an old married woman . " " Elizabeth , you 're thirty-eight , " I said . " You know what I mean , " Elizabeth said . " I 'm just interested in what life is like when you ca n't stay married . " I got up and walked down the length of my loft , breathing deeply and carefully . I bent down and gave Rosie a kiss on the nose , and breathed some more and walked slowly back . " We who ca n't stay married prefer to keep our sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sunny , honestly you 're so quaint sometimes . " " Quaint , " I said . The sun was almost straight up and it shone strongly through my skylight onto one of my paintings that stood unfinished on its easel . " You 're still painting , " Elizabeth said . " Yes . " " Does anyone ever buy one of your paintings ? " " Occasionally . " " Really ? " I nodded . We sat quietly for a while . Elizabeth reached over and got the pot and poured herself some more coffee . She did n't replace the pot . Just set it down on the counter near her where it would grow cold . It took some will , but I did n't reach across and replace it . I did n't want any more anyway . " How 's Hal , " I said . She carefully poured some milk into her coffee and stirred in two sugars , and put the spoon down and sipped from the cup . " I think he 's cheating on me , " Elizabeth said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so , and , is n't this funny , I want you to see if you can find out for sure . " " Me ? " " You are being a detective these days , are n't you ? " " Yes , of course , but . . . " " I would n't want to hire some stranger , " Elizabeth said . " You want me to tail him ? Get pictures ? Catch him in the act ? That sort of thing ? " " Yes . " " Why do n't you just ask him ? " " Ask him ? Do n't be ridiculous . Why in God 's name would he tell me ? " " Because you asked , " I said . " No . I 'm not asking that bastard anything . I am going to catch him . " " You do n't want to maybe talk about this with him , see about professional help ? " " A shrink ? They 're all crazy . It 's why they became shrinks . " " Maybe not every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of them are Jews . " " Maybe not every one of them , " I said . " I do n't want to discuss this anymore . Will you help me ? " " Of course . I was just trying to see if we could agree on the kind of help you needed . " " Well it 's certainly not some crazy Jew , " Elizabeth said . I thought about going down and lying on the bed with Rosie . Arguing with Elizabeth was futile . She was , as my father used to say about our mother , often wrong , but never uncertain . And like our mother she simply dug in deeper when her convictions were questioned . If they were actually disproved , she was entrenched for life . " I 'll do whatever I can , " I said .
