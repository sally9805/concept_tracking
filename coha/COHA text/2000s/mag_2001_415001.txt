Teaching Good Nutrition and Sound Farming in the School Cafeteria // For many students , the cafeteria bell produces visions of long lines , hair nets and perfectly molded , ice cream scoop servings of starchy , lackluster food . But as the nation renews a focus on nutrition , several inspired school districts are dismissing this grade school nightmare with higher ideals for the standard school lunch . In its quest to nurture both young minds and bodies , the Berkeley Unified School District passed in 1999 a food program policy designed to provide a healthy meal to each of its 10,000 students-a meal in which the nutritional content far outweighs the chemical . Integral to this 12-point plan is the phase-out of bovine growth hormones and genetically engineered ingredients , and the incorporation of locally grown , organic foods . A San Francisco Bay area grower delivers organic apple juice weekly , and a distributor provides organic processed foods like tortilla chips , peanut butter and graham crackers . Organic gardens , including one at Martin Luther King , Jr . Middle School spearheaded by renowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of organic farming , and give them a handson role in bringing some of the food to the table . More than a dozen local farmers provide the rest of the vegetables and 40 cases of fruits the schools go through each week for breakfasts , lunches and after-school snacks . After all , " an explicit goal of the program is to not only benefit children , but organic and local farmers : ' says Eric Weaver , chair of Berkeley 's Child Nutrition Advisory Committee . The distrio has spent about $90,000 on organic foods in the last year . Weekly visits to farmers markets , for instance , fill up the salad bars , which are opening at each of the 15 Berkeley schools . " There is a certain responsibility in an educational environment to provide students with a healthy lunch-choices based largely on the food pyramid , with whole grains , fresh fruits and vegetables , " says Laurel Lyle , the manager of the cafeteria at the Peabody Charter School in Santa Barbara , California , which began incorporating an ethic similar to Berkeley 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for kids to see that cooking fresh food is not a revolutionary or miraculous event , " she adds . " It 's really very easy . " Lyle incorporates such organic ingredients as flour for freshly baked breads and beans for stew to carrot sticks in each meal at Peabody . As a result , kids and teachers alike who were once brown bagging it are now setting down trays at the lunch table . Food waste is vastly reduced as well , says Lyle . " Because most of the things I make are fresh and separate , anything not eaten is used the next day in something else . Other schools may throw out 100 servings of food a day . Talk about an environmental nightmare . " The real nightmare , according to Susan Campbell of nonprofit Spirit in Action , lies in the vending machines that still provide powerful temptation . " Kids already know that they 're supposed to eat more fruits and vegetables , " says Campbell . " But if they 're still guzzling Coca-Cola and eating Snickers , it 's defeating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culprits . " Kids eat too much junk food , says Campbell , and most schools sell it inside their walls . As turning back this tide of sugar-laden candy and soda is not likely , Spirit in Action has invited manufacturers of natural and organic snack foods to go head-to-head with conventional a-la-carte items . A pilot project with high schools in California and Colorado will be launched this spring , offering kids looking for foods on the run a healthier alternative . Full-service kiosks will follow in the fall of 2001 . Photograph Students at Berkeley 's Malcolm X Elementary School enjoy locally grown food from the salad bar . // " Good nutrition impacts thinking skills , " says Sandy Neumann , program officer for education at the Center for Ecoliteracy , a public foundation that works with the Berkeley School District . " We talk about accountability , but kids are trying to be accountable when they do n't have the physical resources to call upon within their own bodies ! Although the solution-offering fresh , local , unadulterated foods-seems logical , the barriers to reach it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finicky , " says Elsie Szeto , director of child nutrition services at Berkeley , and a registered dietician . " They need to be familiar with a food , or they wo n't touch it . It needs a shape or form they know . " Secondly , " the food service is self-supporting : ' says Szeto , " and we only have so much money to work with . " Nine of the Berkeley schools were recently given funding to provide afterschool snacks , for example . But of the 54 cents designated per student , 14 goes to overhead , leaving only 30 cents to cover the costs of food , which must be selected from two of three food groups . Although last year the snacks were en tirely organic , this year conventional cheese was the only affordable choice . Covering the cost of free and reduced meals poses another challenge . If passed , a bill now in the California State Senate would provide increased meal reimbursement for any school in the state that purchases fresh food . Related legislation has popped up elsewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urges the Minneapolis School District to consider organic foods for its lunch program ; a resolution now pending in the city of San Francisco originally included such sentiment , but was eventually watered down . " As consciousness continues to rise about globalization and lost autonomy in our lives , we 'll see more resolutions in which people say they ca n't depend on our government to protect the food supply , " says Simon Harris of San Francisco 's Organic Consumer Alliance . " And that our school districts and local governments should . " Berkeley 's program sets an important precedent , believes Harris . " School boards are looking for replicable models , " he says , " a specific list of actions , something substantive that can be taken to other school districts . Once they can say , Look , this works , ' it will be replicated on a larger scale . " This ripple effect is already occurring within Berkeley itself . Seed money from a U.S. Department of Agriculture grant has cascaded into two successful bond measures and nearly $1.5 million in additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kitchens at each of the schools , enabling on-site preparation of meals now restricted to mainly frozen , prepackaged ordeals . The grants will support nutrition education for faculty and school officials , provide garden coordinators and cooking program specialists , fund field trips to local farms and develop a business plan to ensure the program 's fiscal success . <p>
