IF YOU BREAK your brand-new PC in right , you can keep trouble at arm 's length . During break-in , you 'll set the system to standby or hibernate , schedule your backups , and customize Windows ' appearance to your specific taste . Of course , you can improve any PC 's performance and security by disabling many of Windows XP 's automatic settings , and by activating certain features that Microsoft leaves off by default . You 'll also want to rid a new PC of various preloaded applications and trial versions that you do n't really need , and install and configure a couple of other programs designed to keep you safe and productive . Finally , you can take a few minutes to turn off many of Windows ' more annoying and useless frills . It may take a while to fine-tune everything , but in the end , you can point to your computer and say " There are many PCs like it , but this one is mine . " These steps will improve the performance of any system , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and they 'll reduce your irritation factor substantially . ( Note that the steps described here are for XP Pro , but they should work with other versions of XP as well , though the options may be slightly different . ) Step 1 : Show the My Computer icon . This desktop shortcut provides fast access to the Device Manager , your Services list , and other settings you 're likely to need when you set up your PC and when you make changes later . Unfortunately , Windows XP does n't display the My Computer icon on the desktop by default . To add it , right-click an empty area of the desktop , choose Properties , and click Desktop*Customize Desktop . Check My Computer and any other icons-such as My Network Places-that you want on your desktop ( see FIGURE 1 ) . You may wish to uncheck Internet Explorer if you do n't open the browser via that desktop shortcut ( it also appears on XP 's Start*All Programs menu ) . And since I prefer to clean my own desktop , I uncheck Run Desktop Cleanup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settings . For security reasons , I disable XP 's Remote Assistance and Remote Desktop features . ( Your PC vendor may use these features for online support , but they create potential access points for malware . ) To close the door , right-click My Computer , choose Properties to open the System Properties dialog box , select the Remote tab , uncheck all the options , and click Apply . To improve my system 's performance , I turn off most of Windows ' fancy visuals , such as those that slide , fade , and otherwise animate menus and list boxes . ( I prefer a menu that snaps into position as soon as I click something . ) To disable these effects , click the Advanced tab in the System Properties dialog box , and choose the Settings button in the Performance section . Then uncheck the boxes on the Visual Effects tab to turn off the features you do n't want or need . I leave " Show shadows under mouse pointer ' checked to make the pointer easier to find on the screen ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag it , I keep that box checked as well . But I turn off the other shadows and fading , sliding , and smoothing features by clearing their boxes . When you 're done , click Apply . Step 3 : See the Blue Screen of Death . Another troublesome feature is easy to dispatch via the System Properties dialog : On the Advanced tab , choose Settings in the Startup and Recovery area , uncheck Automatically restart , and click OK . Now if XP crashes and shows you the dreaded blue screen , you 'll be able to record the error message so you can perform some in-depth troubleshooting . Otherwise , Windows will restart immediately , often leaving you no way to figure out what happened . In a worst-case scenario-which some people encountered when they installed the Service Pack 2 update to XP-Windows blue-screens during the installation process , reboots , blue-screens again , reboots again , and continues ad infinitum . If you ever need to force a restart when this feature is unchecked , just hit your PC case 's reset button . Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dialog box , click the Hardware tab and then the Device Manager button . A yellow question-mark icon next to an entry indicates that a necessary driver is n't loaded for that device . You may need to load it manually from the CD accompanying your PC or motherboard . Doubleclick the entry , choose the Driver tab , select the Update Driver button , and follow the prompts , pointing to the folder containing the driver on the installation CD when instructed to do so . ( Note that even with a brand-new PC , a more recent version of the driver may be available on the device manufacturer 's Web site . ) Step 5 : Patch , patch , patch . Now that you have established control over the PC , it 's time to hit up Microsoft for the latest Windows fixes . But be warned : Until you download and install all the latest drivers and patches for Windows , the only sites you should open in Internet Explorer are your hardware vendors ' page ( to download driver updates ) and update.microsoft. com ( where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing as Windows Update but can also find and load fixes for Office and other Microsoft programs ) . The two PCs I used as test beds for this story , both preloaded with Windows XP S , required 45 critical security patches the first time they connected to Microsoft Update . On my DSL line , the process took about 30 minutes from first connection to last reboot . At least Microsoft has the patching trick down ; I guess lots of practice makes perfect . Step 6 : Tweak your way to speed and safety . Microsoft 's Tweak UI ( find.pcworld. com/53572 ) is so useful that it 's one of the first tools I install on a new PC , and one of the first shortcuts I put on my desktop . Few Windows tools are more helpful for making the operating system look and work just the way you want it to . To reduce the delay before a submenu appears when you hover over it , doubleclick Mouse in the left pane , click Hover , and change the time , in milliseconds , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like My Computer to appear as the first icon on screen when you clean up your desktop , double-click Desktop , choose First Icon , and click My Computer . AutoPlay is the Windows feature that let Sony install its rootkit-like digital rights management software on so many PCs without detection . If you do n't mind having to start your CDs manually by double-clicking their icon on the drive 's menu or folder under My Computer , you can improve security by turning off AutoPlay for CDs and removable drives : Double-click My Computer , double-click AutoPlay , choose Types , and uncheck both items . If you want to disable AutoPlay on all of your drives , choose Drives in the left pane , uncheck all 26 drive letters , and finish by clicking OK ( see FIGURE 2 ) . Step 7 : Disable unneeded System Tray apps . Most system-tray applets squander RAM and CPU cycles to little or no purpose . Browse to find.pcworld.com/53680 to check out Scott Spanbauer 's " 15 Icons You Can Dump " from his October 2004 feature , " Keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for reducing application and system clutter . Step 8 : Lose the XP-style Start Menu . To me , XP 's Start Menu feels like a step backward . To revert to the older version , right-click the Start button , choose Properties , and click Classic Start menu . Next , click the Customize button ; and check three options in the " Advanced Start menu options " box : Display Administrative Tools , Expand Control Panel ( which lets you get to the applet that you need without having to open the whole Control Panel window ) , and Show small icons in Start menu ( which keeps everything tidy ) . Most important , scroll to the bottom of that list of options and uncheck Use personalized menus , which gets rid of the annoying feature that makes the OS pause before showing you all of your options ( in the Start menu , at least ) ; see FIGURE 3 . Step 9 : Set Windows Explorer 's folder views . To change the view for all of your folder windows , open a window ( one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and choose Tools*Folder Options . Select the General tab and click Use Windows classic folders . Click the View tab , and check Display file size information in folder tips , Display the contents of system folders , Display the full path in the address bar , and Show hidden files and folders . Uncheck Hide extensions for known file types and Use simple file sharing . Disabling that last option actually turns on the Security tab in the Properties dialog box of your files and folders . Finally , click Apply to All Folders*OK . Step 10 : Dump the " Are You Sure ? " warning . Yes , I 'm sure I want to place those files in the Recycle Bin , right now . To keep this nagging dialog box at bay , right-click the Recycle Bin , select Properties , and uncheck Display delete confirmation dialog . Another unnecessary annoyance bites the dust . Step 11 : Turn off the Windows logo screen saver . The only saving my LCD screen needs is from Microsoft 's obnoxious floating Windows XP logo . To get rid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ click the Screen Saver tab , select ( None ) on the drop-down menu , and click OK . Step 12 : Start and stop silently . To mute Windows ' startup and shutdown sounds , click Start*Settings*Control Panel ( or just Start*Control Panel if you ignored my advice in Step 8 ) . Next , choose Sounds and Audio Devices , and click the Sounds tab . Scroll through the list under Program events , select Exit Windows , and choose ( None ) in the Sounds drop-down menu ( see FIGURE 4 ) . Do the same for Start Windows , and click Apply . If you 'd like your system to be completely soundless , choose No Sounds under Sound scheme . When you 're done , click OK .
