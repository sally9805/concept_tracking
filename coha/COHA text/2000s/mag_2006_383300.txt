Our film critic ( yes , our film critic ) explains that we are living in-and shoul celebrate-television 's golden age . Take that , movie snobs. // The premise is that we 're living in a new golden age of television . The proof is in the next six pages , an unassailable argument for the creative dominance of the medium at a time when the availability of a thousand channels feels justified . From the rigorous elegance of dramas like 24 and The Shield to the addictive spectacle of reality shows like American Idol and Survivor , TV is where pop culture is born , celebrated , psychoanalyzed , judged , and recycled in rapid succession . Some may swear by The Sopranos and The Daily Show , others pledge allegiance to Prison Break and Desperate Housewives , but all of us are beneficiaries of a full-circle moment in mass media when the smartest guys in the room are working for the small screen . * As CBS Paramount TV president David Stapf puts it with no false modesty , " TV is as good as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You do n't have time to meander . So writers hone their craft on 22 little movies a year . " * The evidence-and an intelligent person 's guide to separating the best from the rest-is elegantly presented by writers from EW 's TV department . All that 's left is to explain why a critic usually found in darkened movie theaters is here cheering for her home TV. * That part is easy : Any episode of any Law &; Order is better than half the feature-length dramas released each week . Any episode of The Office is better than 80 percent of the comedies . Any episode of The Wire ( which did n't make this roundup since the focus is on series you can see right now ; The Wire returns this fall ) is as good as anything nominated for an Oscar . Television is where interesting indie filmmakers like Michael Almereyda and Darnell Martin go to direct episodic dramas when Hollywood runs out of uses for them , where Crash writer-director Paul Haggis goes after he wins an Oscar , and where great actresses like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age out of Hollywood 's camera range . * It 's where I go every day for cultural grounding , amazed at what point-and-click riches there are to be found while sitting in my sweatpants . You too ? - Lisa Schwarzbaum HOUR PICKS We scoured New Jersey , Las Vegas , and who the heck knows where to compile our list of the top 10 dramas you should be watching every week . 1 24 ( Fox , Mon. , 9 p.m . ) The one element long missing from this crackerjack thriller-scenes permitting Kiefer Sutherland to portray something more than mere brutal efficiency-has paid off this season with a succession of surprisingly moving moments , as well as eyebrow-raising deaths ( Tony ! our big lovable bear Edgar ! ) , great guest stars ( Peter Weller deserves a spin-off series from his stint ) , and an Emmy-worthy performance by Gregory Itzin as the president . 2 . The Sopranos ( HBO , Sun. , 9 p.m . ) The ultimate family drama is also one of television 's most layered : This season entwines unsettling dream sequences with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions of loyalty , morality , and the nature of existence . The lead actors are brilliant , the writing a thing of pure beauty-even when it 's ugly . 3 CSI ( CBS , Thurs. , 9 p.m . ) More proof that the mass audience is smarter than some think . TV 's No. 1 drama is also its most subtly poetic , investigating heinous deaths with curiosity about how love twists into the urge to destroy life . 4 . Battlestar Galactica ( Sci Fi Channel , Sat. , 2 a.m . ) Science fiction as a topsy-turvy dystopia : a female president ; alien replicants who sometimes display more humanity than the humans ; dialogue that works as ongoing political/religious debate rather than the usual sci-fi gobbledygook . In divisive times , here 's TV 's only drama that courts both the right and the left with equal conviction . 5 Lost ( ABC , Wed. , 9 p.m . ) Some people have elaborate , even convincing , ways of Explaining It All . The rest of us simply remain hypnotized , from the minutes before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every harrowing cliff-hanger hour . It 's Survivor with a heart , a brain , and courage : The Wizard of Oz as nightmare . 6 . Everwood ( The WB , Mon. , 9 p.m . ) The cast-from doc/dad Treat Williams to Chris Pratt 's affable jock-is sterling , and worthy of this unique series : Everwood is a sensitive , smart family soap that allows its likable characters to screw up and fall short , yet always strive to do the right thing . This tiny Colorado town is n't filled with villains and divas , but plain , genuine , decent people , a twist that turns out to be absolutely compelling . 7 Gilmore Girls ( The WB , Tues. , 8 p.m . ) Witty , sharp banter with a heartbeat-two hearts , in fact , that often beat as one : the idealized , yet somehow utterly realistic , mother-daughter team of Lauren Graham 's Lorelai and Alexis Bledel 's Rory . This season , their ugly rift and long-awaited patch-up have brought them closer-to each other , and to us. 8 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 9 p.m. , Tues , at 10 p.m. , and Wed . at 9 p.m . ) The definition of reliable , the Law &; Order trifecta-16-year-old Law &; Order , the more emotive Special Victims Unit , and the twisty Criminal Intent-is the best of TV 's legal dramas , with wry , knowing players and oddly familiar au courant stories . 9 Veronica Mars ( UPN , Wed. , 9 p.m . ) The titular teen detective-a pert wiseacre of a heroine-is quickly becoming a character for the ages . The show 's intricate mythology rivals Lost with about 18 ( ! ) mysteries currently in play . 10 . The Shield ( Spike TV , Fri. , 10 p.m . ) The past season of this FX series-catch reruns on Spike TV-was one of the best for this jabby police drama . Guest star Forest Whitaker , obsessively investigating Michael Chiklis ' magnetic antihero , ratcheted tensions wonderfully high within the L.A. police squad-staffed with one of TV 's all-time great ensemble casts .

Caveman 's son was forced to wear a sign to school attesting " I am only a theory .
