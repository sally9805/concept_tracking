<p> POOR FLORIDA . AS ONE OF THE ELITE COLLEGE BASKETBALL PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY , IT WAS AT A DISTINCT DISADVANTAGE IN THE NCAA TOURNAMENT AGAINST CREIGHTON , WHICH GETS ALL THE BENEFITS OF THE GLAMOROUS LIFE OF ONE OF THE MID-MAJOR TEAMS IN THE SPORT . <p> So when little Creighton , filled with scraps and spare parts , beat mighty Florida and its All-Americans on Friday at the United Center , it was only to be expected . <p> " They 're not knocking heads against the teams we 're knocking heads against 15 , 16 weeks a year , " said Florida coach Billy Donovan , his hair still slicked back perfectly after the Gators ' 83-82 double-overtime loss . " That hurts us . " <p> So there 's a new take on things . The buzz entering the tournament was about the mid-majors , which basically account for all the schools you 've never heard of . <p> Such as Creighton , which is in Omaha , Neb . <p> Good mid-majors , the theory went , are overlooked by the NCAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from big-time conferences . The mid-majors ca n't schedule regular-season games against the big boys , and if they can , those games are only on the road . As a result , mid-majors ca n't get high rankings in the computers , which consider a victory against Butler about as impressive as beating up a kid sister . <p> But in defeat , Donovan managed to find Cinderella 's built-in advantages . Think how rested she must have been from not having to go to gala balls all the time . <p> In the real world , life as a mid-major always is about trying to prove you belong , then , upon proving it , being punished for it . The plight of the mid-major is n't pleasant , but it is improving . Gonzaga proved that in the last few years by doing well in the NCAA tournament . <p> ESPN analyst Dick Vitale , the screaming voice of college basketball , says the NCAA should not allow more than five teams from any major conference into the tournament at any time . CBS analyst Billy Packer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " ridiculous " and " nonsensical . " <p> Which one is right ? <p> After the first few days of the tournament , it is too close to call . Packer 's point might have the edge . But as Vitale says , the fun of the tournament , at least in the early rounds , is in watching upsets . <p> North Carolina-Wilmington beat Southern California . Kent State beat Oklahoma State and Alabama . <p> And Chicago has become the hot spot for mid-majors , with Creighton 's victory and Southern Illinois ' 76-68 triumph Friday against Texas Tech . For the first time , three No. 12 seeds advanced to the second round . <p> " I guess some teams come out with a little more passion because they feel they have something to prove , " Creighton 's Brody Deren said . " We came here as a so-called underdog . Chalk one up for the mid-major . " <p> Under the spotlight , those games seem to prove a point . In truth , only a handful of mid-major teams survived the first round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Even Gonzaga is out . <p> San Diego State , another mid-major , watched on TV in the Aztecs ' locker room at the United Center as Creighton beat Florida . The players became emotional . If Creighton can do it , they figured , so can we . <p> Illinois 93 , San Diego State 64 . <p> Afterward , San Diego State star forward Randy Holcomb , who scored only nine points , was asked what Illinois did to shut him down so completely . <p> " It was their size , " he said . " When I get on the floor , I 'm usually one of the bigger guys . " <p> Not this time . <p> And that 's what stands out about mid-major players : their honesty . They seem fresh , not cynical . <p> Creighton 's Terrell Taylor , who made the game-winning shot , talked about how thrilled he was to be playing in the arena where Michael Jordan played . He was excited just to see Jordan 's statue outside the building . Southern Illinois coach Bruce Weber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anyone could keep up with , but it included , " I told them before the game that we are a good basketball team , and that 's what you 've got to think . " <p> So for a few days , some mid-majors have found validation . <p> " Even though it was Texas Tech coach Bobby Knight we were going against today , he was n't on the court , " Southern Illinois ' Jermaine Dearman said . " We were n't playing the name today , but the players . " <p> The players and coaches from mid-majors argue that they are just as good as the majors , that there is no reason to be surprised by a victory . <p> " I do n't know if there 's much difference , " Creighton coach Dana Altman said . <p> At the same time , though , they play mind games to convince themselves about what they are saying . <p> North Carolina-Wilmington 's players brought cameras to the tournament a few years ago to capture their big moment . This time , they left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sending out the best message . <p> " We 're humbled by the fact we 're even in the NCAAs , " Wilmington coach Jerry Wainwright said after his team 's victory against USC in Sacramento , Calif . " Two years ago , I overprepared our team for the worst things that could happen . This year , I prepared our team for the best things we could do . " <p> But how could a mid-major possibly keep up ? <p> The big-time programs recruit the best high school players . Florida 's recruiting list seems to come straight from the McDonald 's All-American roster . Does Southern Illinois recruit All-Americans ? <p> " No , " Weber said . " It would be a waste of time . " <p> Mid-majors get the leftovers , the lesser guys . " <p> But Creighton beat Florida . <p> " It depends on your opinion of ' lesser guys , " ' Altman said . " We get good basketball players . I do n't think our guys have to apologize just because they 're not on somebody 's recruiting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a hit because they are less athletic , but they are coachable . Our guys do n't have to take a back seat to anybody . " <p> Still , Altman acknowledged that most of his top players , including Taylor , were not recruited by any school other than Creighton . <p> But Weber said big-time teams rely too much on All-American lists . He said big-time coaches are so competitive for players that they recruit too early , off potential , before seeing what a prospect really can do in high school . <p> " And then some of those guys do n't get to be quite as good as hoped , " he said . " If we get the leftovers , we end up getting the late-bloomers . Nobody recruits them early on , then they turn out to be good . <p> " Then those players stay with us and develop for three or four years and all learn to play together . At some of those majors , they lose guys to the NBA draft after a year or two . " <p> Weber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the potential value ( read : profits ) of successful basketball . So those schools are sinking bigger bucks into recruiting budgets , facilities and salaries to retain top coaches . <p> The big issue now , Weber said , is getting big-time programs to play his team . And why would they ? It could lead to a loss to a team no one has heard of . <p> This season , the Salukis ' big breakthrough was that Indiana  --  under a contract signed by Knight when he was the Hoosiers ' coach  --  played in Carbondale . It not only gave Southern Illinois confidence and a measuring stick , but it also provided the school with a needed boost in the computers ' strength-of-schedule category . <p> In the end , Southern Illinois did n't earn an automatic bid to the tournament by winning its conference championship . Instead , it got a rare mid-major invitation . Weber said he could n't sleep during the final nights before the tournament field was selected . But now , he and Creighton are proving their point . <p> They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> And Weber knows what that means . <p> " Now , " he said , " no one will probably ever come to Carbondale again .
