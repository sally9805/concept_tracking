Chapter One Cornelia My life-my real life-started when a man walked into it , a handsome stranger in a perfectly cut suit , and , yes , I know how that sounds . My friend Linny would snort and convey the kind of multipronged disgust I rely on her to convey . One prong of feminist disgust at the whole idea of a man changing a woman 's life , even though , as things turned out , the man himself was more the harbinger of change than the change itself . Another prong of disgust for the inaccuracy of saying my life began after thirty-one years of living it . And the final prong being a kind of general disgust for the way people turn moments in their lives into movie moments . I do this more than I should , I 'll give her that , but there was something backlit and sudden about his walking through the door of the cafe I managed . If the floor had been bare and not covered with tables , chairs , people , and dogs , the autumnal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor in a real Orson Welles shot . But Linny can jab me with her three-pronged disgust fork all she wants , and I 'd still say that my life started on that October morning when a man walked through the door . It was an ordinary day-palpably ordinary , if that makes any sense , like it was asserting its smooth usualness . A Saturday , loud , smoke already piling up and hovering like weather over me and the customers in Cafe Dora . I sat where I always sat when I was n't waiting on someone-on a high stool behind the counter-and I watched Hayes and Jose play chess . Everyone said they were good players . They themselves said they were . " Not prodigy good , " said Hayes . " Not Russian , Deep-freakin ' - Blue- playing good . But hell . " Hayes was from Texas and wrote the wine column for the Philadelphia Inquirer . He liked to swear in offbeat ways , liked to walk in , turn a chair around backward with a bang , and straddle it . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a liquid-eyed , sorrowful look , and moved a chess piece from one square to another . I do n't know the game well , but whatever Jose had done , it must have been something , because Hayes tossed back his head and hooted , " Hot damn , boy ! You pulled that one right out of your ass ! " Hayes looked at me with a wry smile and a genial cowboy twinkle in his eye , and I lifted one corner of my mouth in a kind of rueful facial shrug . " What can you do ? " my face said . But do n't get attached to Hayes . As he was already in the room , he 's obviously not the man who walked into it bearing the new life on his shoulders , and he does n't finally figure into this story much . Not sure why I started with Hayes , except that in lots of ways he 's a neat little embodiment of the old life : a self-invented , smartish , semialluring wine snob disguised as a cowboy , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue and probably a real person under there somewhere , but possibly not . In college , I read Piers Plowman in which this man Will goes on a journey and runs into characters like Holy Church and Gluttony . Think of Hayes as a character like that : **38;198;TOOLONG . I 've always found allegories kind of comforting . When you encounter people named Liar and Abstinence , you might not be crazy about them , but you know exactly what you 're getting into . Another regular , Phaedra , made her entrance , all blowsy auburn curls , leather pants , and nursing-mother breasts , and tugging a giant black pram behind her-one of those English nanny prams with high , white rubber tires . Five people jumped up and nearly cracked one another 's skulls trying to hold the door open for her . Phaedra directed a beseeching look at the couple sitting at the table nearest the door , a look that turned out to be unnecessary . The man and woman were already hustling up their cappuccinos , jackets , camera bags , and backpacks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cornelia ! " Phaedra sang at me across the room in just the sort of musical voice you 'd expect to come out of her mouth . " Could you ? Cafe au lait ? Loads of sugar ? And something sinful ! " We do n't have table service . Phaedra made a helpless , sighing gesture with her shoulders and her long hands , indicating her child , her exhaustion , the whole ancient weight of motherhood . Phaedra was a pain . But Allegra was a different story . Bearing the coffee and a croissant , I came out from behind my counter and made my zigzag way around tables and dogs for the sake of Phaedra 's baby , Allegra . And there she was , wrapped in a leopard-print blanket , just waking up . A blue-eyed , translucent , bewitching witch of a baby , fresh as new bread in that smoky room . Allegra resembled Phaedra , same white skin , same glorious Carole Lombard forehead , but with carrot-orange hair that flew out in all directions . I waited for the pang ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to touch her , specifically to sleep with her in the crook of my right arm . I put the croissant and the coffee in front of Phaedra , then cradled my elbows with my hands . Allegra was asleep and making nursing motions with her mouth because what else would babies dream about ? " Face it . You want one , " said Phaedra . With effort , I shifted my gaze from gorgeous child to gorgeous pain-in-the-ass mother . " See that ? " said Phaedra . " You had to literally drag your eyes away from her . " Ouch , I thought , and then sat down to talk for a minute , Phaedra 's misuse of the word " literally " having created a warm spot in my heart , tiny but large enough to prompt a five- minute conversation . " How 's business ? " I asked . Phaedra was a jewelry designer . " Not good . I 'm starting to think people just do n't get it , " said Phaedra . Her signature pieces , or what would be her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made out of sea glass and platinum , a juxtaposition of the ordinary and extraordinary , Phaedra claimed , that forced one to rethink one 's perceptions of " value " and " preciousness . " Maybe people did n't get it . Or maybe they got it but did n't feel sufficiently moved to shell out eight hundred dollars for a bracelet made of old Heineken bottles . Phaedra lifted her coffee to her lips , eyeing me brightly through the steam . " Cornelia , what if you wore some of the pieces in the cafe , just to generate interest ? " Her tone suggested the idea had just popped into her head . In fact , this was the third time she 'd asked . " I ca n't wear jewelry at work , " I said , not elaborating but rolling my eyes in a way I hoped suggested some unseen powers-that-be who hovered over me , forbidding jewelry . The truth was that I never wore jewelry anywhere , ever . I 'm five feet tall and built like a preteen , eighty-five pounds soaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that , given my smallness , jewelry will make me look like a geegaw or doodad , a spangly ornament to hang on a tree . It 's a shame , too , because I adore it . Not so much Phaedra 's kind-cool , angular objects-but serious jewels : diamonds , cuffs and chokers , brooches like shooting stars , tiaras . Jean Harlow jewels , Irene Dunne on the ship in Love Affair . Allegra stirred in her leopard-print nest , yawned , and shot out a fist . Phaedra lifted her onto her lap , instantly dipping her swan neck , dropping her face into the orange hair , breathing in her child 's scent . An authentic gesture , automatic , unstudied . I felt prickles shoot down my arms . I touched a finger to Allegra 's hand , and she gripped it hard and hung on . " You should have one , you know , " said Phaedra , harping , and this instantly got my hackles up , until I saw her face , which was something like kind . Phaedra was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So I just trilled a little laugh and said , breezily , " Me with a baby . Can you imagine ? " " Of course , I can . Perfectly , " said Phaedra . " And so can you . " While I resented her smug smile , and while I 'd have died before admitting it to her , I had to admit to myself that she was at least partly right : I could n't imagine it perfectly , but I could imagine it . Had imagined it , in fact , more than once . But , every time , what brought me to my senses was my conviction that before a person dropped a new life into this world , she should probably get a real one herself . The truth was , I was treading water and had been for some time . If you 're wondering why a thirty-something woman who had gone to all the trouble of attending a university and slogging through medieval allegorical texts had risen no higher on the career food chain than cafe manager , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer I 'd come up with was that I had n't figured out anything better-not yet . If I were to ever have a full-fledged vocation , as opposed to a half-assed avocation , I needed to love it and , in my experience , it is n't always easy to figure out what you love . You 'd think it would be , but it is n't . Also , if you stay in it for any length of time , like anyplace else , a cafe becomes a world . I felt suddenly weary , looking at Phaedra and Allegra and the shining black pram . And if a woman weighing less than ninety pounds can be said to heave herself , I heaved myself out of my seat and lugged myself back to my spot behind the bar . All of which is meant to demonstrate the ordinariness of the day and how the ordinariness was even taking on shades of dreariness and futility . Because you have to understand what my life was like in the " before " in order to see just how much it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Except that - and I honestly believe this , Linny 's pooh-poohing of movie moments notwithstanding-just before , a minute before the cafe door opened one more time , the ordinary day turned itself up a notch , in preparation . The light falling through the high , arched windows went from mellow to brilliant , turning the old copper of the espresso machine to pure gold . And the music-Sarah Vaughan , whom I worship , singing George and Ira , whom I worship-was suddenly floating and dipping like some kind of bird in the clear space above the cigarette smoke and chitchat . The coffee smelled sublime , the flowers I 'd bought that morning pierced the air with their blueness , the coffee cups lost their chips and glowed eggshell-thin , and standing in my red sweater and vintage suede skirt , my boots solidly on the floor , I felt almost tall . The door of Cafe Dora opened , and Cary Grant walked in . If you have n't seen The Philadelphia Story , stop what you are doing , rent it , and watch it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you watch it , you will have been living a partial and colorless life . However , it is definitely on the list of perfect things . You know what I mean , the list that includes the starry sky over the desert , grilled cheese sandwiches , The Great Gatsby , the Chrysler building , Ella Fitzgerald singing " It Do n't Mean a Thing ( If You Ai n't Got That Swing ) , " white peonies , and those little sketches of hands by Leonardo da Vinci . If you have seen it , then you know there 's a moment when Katharine Hepburn as Tracy Lord steps from a poolside cabana . She 's got a straight white dream of a dress hanging from her tiny collarbones , a dress fluted and precise as a Greek column but light and full of the motion of smoke . A paradox of a dress , a marriage of opposites that just makes your teeth hurt it 's so exactly right . I was fourteen when I first saw it . It was three days before Christmas , which in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always mean , Yuletide sensory overload : every room stuffed to the gills with garland and holly , the whole place booming with Johnny Mathis , and a monstrosity of a tree towering in the living room , weighed down with ornaments of every description , including dozens defying description that my brothers , sister , and I had made in school over the years . Fourteen was not a good year for me . I was the latest of late bloomers , of course , about two feet high and scrawny as a cat , still shopping in the children 's department , profoundly allergic to every member of my family , and convinced that nothing could make me happy . But then my grouchy channel-surfing landed me in the middle of a black-and-white heaven : Tracy , the dress . I was so struck , I forgot how to swallow and began to truly asphyxiate on a sip of 7-Up . And when , a little later , Tracy unfastened the belt from her willow waist and slipped her faultlessly formed self out of that faultlessly formed garment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's her bathing suit cover-up ! " which my father , who was sitting on the floor fastening-no joke-jingle bells to the collars of our cats , did not appreciate . I turned every atom of myself over to the rest of the movie . People must 've gone tearing through the room , because people always did go tearing through rooms , especially my brothers Cam and Toby , who were eight and nine at the time . But a volcano could have begun spewing molten rock inches away from me , and I would not have noticed . I sat . I watched . If a girl could sling a poem over her swimwear as though it were an old T-shirt , what else might be possible ? I slid my fingers over my face , feeling for Tracy 's winged cheekbones . And when Dexter ( Cary Grant ) took Tracy to task , saying , " You 'll never be a first-rate woman or a first-rate human being until you have some regard for human frailty , " I recognized it as wisdom and wondered whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just how to get it if I did n't . In college , I took a film studies class subtitled something like " Turning the Formula on Its Head " in which the professor talked about the trick The Philadelphia Story pulls off . It should never have worked : creating a fantastic love scene between two characters whom you know are not in love with each other , getting you somehow to root for them wholeheartedly during the scene , but then to feel completely satisfied when they end up with other people . Before you get the wrong impression , you should know that I 'm not and never was one of those film people , the kind who argue into the wee hours about the auteur theory and whether Spielberg is the new Capra , or whether John Huston impacts , in unseen ways , every second of American life . I do n't know from camera angles , and I do n't have an encyclopedic knowledge of pre-World War II German cinema , but I fell a little in love with the film professor when he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it should not work . But work it does ! " because he was so passionate and right . When I heard Mike ( Jimmy Stewart ) say to Tracy in that tender , marveling voice , " No , you 're made out of flesh and blood . That 's the blank , unholy surprise of it . You 're the golden girl , Tracy , " I clasped my hands under my pointy chin , prayed that she would run away with him , and swore to God that someday a man would say those words in that voice to me or else I would die . But then , at the movie 's end , my father heard cheering and left water running in the sink to watch his lately distant , disaffected teenage daughter bang her fists on the arms of her chair and turn to him crying , " with a face as open as a flower " ( my dad 's own improbable words ) , saying breathlessly , " She 's marrying Dexter , Daddy . " I 'll admit it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for having been fourteen and deeply benighted about almost everything , but having had the sense to recognize what is surely a universal truth : Jimmy Stewart is always and indisputably the best man in the world , unless Cary Grant should happen to show up . His name was Martin Grace . An excellent name , which , you may have noticed , shares all but three letters with " Cary Grant . " Of course , if you 're not a freak of nature , you probably did n't notice , and you 'll be relieved to know that it did n't even spring to my mind right away . It was later , as I lay in bed that night , that I figured it out , mentally crossing out letters with an imaginary pencil , concentrating pretty hard , but sort of affecting an offhand , semi-interested attitude about it , cocking my head casually on the pillow , even though there was no one in the room to see me . Truth be told , I 'm a little superstitious about names . Back in college @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy from Baton Rouge with a voice like a foghorn purely on the strength of his being named William Powell , whom everyone knows from the Thin Man movies , but who is even better in Libeled Lady and is one of those men whose handsomeness you believe in completely even though you know it does n't exist . My mother met the boy and knew instantly what I was up to . " Your nose looks like Myrna Loy 's , " she 'd said . " Be satisfied with that . " Even so , I did n't ditch Bill until a few nights later when I stood in his **33;238;TOOLONG of a frat house and watched Bill dancing shirtless on a tabletop , his bare , unfortunate belly pulsating like an anguished jellyfish . The bellyfish pulsated , and William Powell , with a delicate shrug , chose that moment to detach himself from Bill forever and slip out into the honeysuckle-scented night . Slippery things , names . Still : Martin Grace . Good . Very good . ( Continues ... )      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
