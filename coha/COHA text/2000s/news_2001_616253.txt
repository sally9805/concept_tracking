<p> Eva Cassidy 's ascent is as astonishing as the voice that came out of her tiny frame . <p> When she died five years ago at age 33 , Cassidy was an obscure singer who could n't land a record deal . She sold her albums out of the trunk of her car . <p> Yet those few who heard her marveled at her voice . The shy , petite blonde possessed a voice of such versatility and soul  --  she reminded many of Aretha Franklin  --  that some were stunned to discover that she was n't black . <p> Cassidy is still surprising people . Her fans during her life numbered only in the hundreds , but her voice is reaching beyond the grave to spawn one of the most improbable success stories in the history of popular music . <p> Her album " Songbird " has gone platinum in England . National Public Radio , " Nightline " and " People " magazine have done features on her . And in Atlanta , major record stores such as Tower Records and Barnes &; Noble Booksellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " She does n't seem dead , " says Elise Burbank of Atlanta , who first heard Cassidy sing on the " Nightline " special , then purchased all her albums . " I keep having this feeling like I want to hear her when she comes to town . She 's so alive and vibrant , it 's hard to realize she 's dead . " <p> Some of Cassidy 's fans make pilgrimages to her home in Bowie , Md . Others share testimonials about the healing power of her songs on a Web site  --  one of at least four dedicated to Cassidy 's music . Some become her evangelists , driven to share her music with others . <p> " A lot of customers become Eva Cassidy experts , " says Carol Willey of Borders Books and Music in Buckhead . " People do n't just buy one of her albums ; they come back and buy others . They become enchanted with her because her story is so poignant . " <p> It 's not the first time death at a young age has boosted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story and those of such artists as Patsy Cline , Buddy Holly , Tupac Shakur and Bob Marley end there . Cassidy was an unknown during her life , and part of her appeal is linked to the perception that today 's pop musicians are packaged like fast food . <p> Her fans say Cassidy was an artist of rare integrity who refused to sing what record companies dictated . She liked to sing everything . In a typical musical set , Cassidy would bounce with ease between spirituals such as " Wade in the Water , " a pop song like Sting 's " Fields of Gold " and a jazz standard like " Autumn Leaves . " <p> " Her art form was never tainted by big business or money motives , " says Pam Collins of Buckhead , who purchased all of Cassidy 's albums after hearing about her on NPR . " That 's a rare commodity in our world . " <p> Lenny Williams , Cassidy 's piano player , says a record company executive from New York once came to Washington to scout Cassidy at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music she wanted to perform . <p> Williams recalls her reply : " Pretty much anything except for that pop crap . " The executive quickly ended the conversation and never called Cassidy again . <p> Cassidy 's fans say the core of her appeal is her voice . Artists as diverse as Sting , Roberta Flack and jazz vocalist Shirley Horn have praised her . Musicians say she had perfect pitch , impeccable phrasing and displayed none of the contrived emotions often found in pop music . She usually sang alone , except for her guitar . <p> Bill Straw , president of Blix Street Records , a small label in North Hollywood , heard her rendition of " Fields of Gold " during the final weeks of her life , while she lay dying in a hospital bed . <p> After her death , he signed a deal with her parents to release her music . <p> " She was one of the best pure singers I 've ever heard , " Straw says . " When I heard her , I heard Roberta Flack , Aretha . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a synthesis , but it did n't draw too much on any of them . She had her own space . " <p> Cassidy was born in Washington , D.C. , into a family of artists . Her father , a special education tutor , played bass and cello and was a sculptor . Her mother came from a family of craftsmen . <p> She began playing guitar and singing at age 9 . But nature was her first love . She craved bicycling and hiking trips . On one of the Web sites  --  www.crosstownarts.com  --  there are several photographs of Eva outdoors , and some of her sketches ( she briefly attended college to study art ) . <p> In the mid-1980s , Cassidy eased into professional music . She was singing backing vocals on recording sessions for local Washington bands when she met Chris Biondo , a bass player and recording engineer . <p> Biondo wanted her to record as a soloist . He literally had to go out into the parking lot and coax her into the studio . <p> " Her thoughts about success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who were more deserving than her , " Biondo recalled . <p> Friends variously describe Cassidy as naive , innocent ( she did n't open her first checking account until she was in her late 20s ) , but also blunt and fiercely independent . <p> Hugh Cassidy says his daughter did n't talk about becoming rich or a famous singer . She hoped to supplement her income from a job at a tree nursery . <p> " She just wanted to make enough money to go into the woods and go hiking whenever she wanted , " he says . <p> Singing before an audience terrified Cassidy . She preferred performing with other artists , because the attention could be directed at them . <p> While she lived , two albums containing Cassidy 's work were released : " The Other Side , " a jazz collection with Chuck Brown , a popular D.C. musician , and " Live at Blues Alley , " a solo album . Two posthumous albums , " Eva by Heart " and " Songbird , " were released three years ago . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Cassidy 's back . The singer , who was very fair , had apparently gotten the growth from the time she spent outdoors . But doctors assured her they had caught it early . <p> In 1996 , Cassidy developed a pain in her hip so severe that she went to the hospital . The cancer had returned . She died four months later , on Nov. 2 , 1996 , of melanoma . <p> Her final performance came at her favorite D.C. club , Blues Alley . Her friends and family had organized a tribute concert . Cassidy , her head bald from chemotherapy , was carried onstage . <p> Leaning on a cane , she apologized for the weakened condition of her lungs . Then she was handed a guitar and sang a version of " What a Wonderful Life " that left many in the audience in tears . She died two months later . <p> Hugh Cassidy says the explosion of interest in his daughter 's music has been " unreal . " He receives letters from as far away as England from people telling him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were weeping as they wrote . <p> Fans have even showed up at the Cassidy home unannounced . One drove from Florida to Maryland just to see where Eva lived . <p> " He seemed a little quirky , " Cassidy says . " He wanted to bask in the place that Eva lived . ' Well , you 're here , ' I told him . So I gave him a 15-minute tour . " <p> The media attention has been just as overwhelming . <p> It started last year when a BBC radio producer played Cassidy 's rendition of " Over the Rainbow . " The BBC was immediately flooded with callers . After the network did an hourlong documentary on Cassidy , her version of " Over the Rainbow " was voted by BBC listeners as one of the top 100 songs of the 20th century . <p> From Britain , her fame spread to her homeland .

" We think that it 's wonderful , " he says . <p> Straw , the record company executive who finally licensed Cassidy 's work , says he sensed that her voice would find an audience after her death . But he 's been shocked at how popular she 's become . Now there is even talk of a movie about her . <p> Biondo , who became her boyfriend , says he 's yet to hear another singer who inspires him like Cassidy . <p> " Eva Cassidy is the best singer I 've ever heard in my life , " he says . " She did n't want to make it , but she 's so good , she made it anyway . " <p> To hear selections from recordings by Eva Cassidy , call 511 , enter 8600 and Soundline number 424 .
