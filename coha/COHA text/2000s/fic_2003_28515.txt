Chapter One Essex , England 917 A.D. Sigrid fled through the flames of Ragnarok , the end of creation , when gods and mortals died . The world , her world , burned . Death pursued her . Saxon curses rang in her ears . Dane , they yelled , Viking whore . We will have revenge on you . The cry of vengeance chilled her to the bone . Her breath sobbed and her feet slid on the dark shingle path between the buildings . The heavy footfalls kept gaining on her . Was there nowhere to hide in the sacked town ? She allowed one desperate glance over her shoulder and then winced as she ran full tilt into a stone wall . At least that was what it felt like , but it moved . A skin of flexible metal , tough as the scales of the World Serpent pulled through her hand , almost tearing it . It was a man clad in a corselet of chain mail , bloodied sword upraised . She screamed . But the sword did not strike . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living . But he held it back . If she was going to die at the hands of a Saxon warrior , let it be quick . Her gaze sought his face , hard and stern under the war helm . She saw his eyes , blue English eyes . They were made of magic . At least , that was the only way to explain it . Because the insane thing she did next she could only have done if she had been spellbound . Her pursuers crashed round the corner and slithered to a stop and her body moved of its own accord in a split instant of speed . Her spine straightened and her hands closed round an arm made of solid muscle encased in rings of iron . The words came out of her mouth , without thought , not in her own Danish but in Saxon , so there could be no mistake . " Go away , " she said . " I am his . " The three , in their ripped and filthy tunics , their chests heaving , wavered . Their eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heated with ale , looked not at her , but at the mountain of chain mail she was clinging to . There was silence . Nothing moved . Sigrid 's heart beat as though it would stifle her and her lungs heaved . What had she done ? How could she have gambled her whole life 's worth on one instant ? How could she have trusted her fate on a momentary impression ? Because that was all she had had : one glimpse of his face in the gathering dark , and there was nothing tangible to tell her that this man was better than any other . He was as Saxon as her pursuers . He was part of an army which had fought all day and had won , and which now had a grudge to settle on the Danish-held town . She was mad . The chain mail she was clutching at had blood on it . Its wearer was a man and a soldier and trained in the use of brute force ; and yet she had seen his face . But then it happened : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , would never have done for her . She felt the solid muscle under her hand move and before she knew what had happened , the mail-clad stranger had swung her round behind him , blocking her from the others with his body , and turned the bloodied sword on her pursuers . The man 's voice , deep , English and entirely reasonable , said , " If any man takes a step forward , I shall kill him . " Three sets of eyes narrowed in that age-old assessment of will and strength that every man has for every other . Even Sigrid 's own eyes turned to the man who now protected her . He was tall and well-made . He had body armor , which her pursuers did not , and the crossguard of his reddened blade flashed gold . There was no chink of weakness in the man beneath the armor , not the remotest consciousness that he might not win . He meant what he said , with a chill finality that brought the sickening realization of just how rash she had been . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would run . He would have to let her go . No one could fight three people , one-handed , with a captive dangling from their left arm . But her pursuers had seen the terrifying chill that she saw . They vanished , melting like evil spirits into the shadows . There would doubtless be easier pickings elsewhere . She would have less than an instant . She twisted , trying to break the grip of the ice warrior 's left hand before he realized , before he had time to spare a thought for her . But she did not even have that . The grasp on her wrist tightened . " Wait , " he said , just one word , but it was a command . There was no one else in sight and she could not break his hold . She was dragged round in front of him . She took another look at his face and wondered what on earth she had seen there . It was handsome enough , as far as you could tell under the helmet and the dust , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dane . Viking whore . We will have our revenge on you . " Let me go , " she said as steadily as she could . " Where to ? " She blinked . But it was not really a question , because he did not stop for an answer and the clipped , reasonable voice continued . " This army is completely out of control . It is commanded , if that is what you can call it , by the biggest ... fool in the entire kingdom of Wessex . He is not going to do anything to stop what is happening and even if he tried it is far too late . " At least , that was what she thought he said . Her English was good , but he had an accent that was almost incomprehensible . And it was the last thing she expected a Saxon to say . He shifted his grip , bringing her arm closer under his so that she could feel the quality of his strength . " Do you not have any kin to protect you ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chill . She made herself look straight into them . " I did , " she said . " I had a husband . He is dead . " Her hand went instinctively to her neck where the silver amulet ring hung suspended on a thin leather strap , no longer round the thick , invincible bull neck of her husband . Her hand shook . The amulet was hidden under the threadbare linen of her chemise , but she could feel every sharp metal outline attached to the ring . There were weapons : two swords , three staffs and Odin 's spear . She knew them by heart . They had never left her husband 's skin while he lived . Never would , because they were part of him .
