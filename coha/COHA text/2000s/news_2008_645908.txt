Editor - Go ahead : It 's a little crazy , but vote " yes " on Proposition 8 . We are all feeling just a bit helpless in scary economic times . So , get a little thrill when you vote to deny some folks in our state their civil rights . It might even make you feel as though you 've regained some control in your life . <p> And what 's so crazy about that ? Well , small things actually , that do add up , and do not really affect your marriage , anyway . Things like a wedding cake , that wo n't be baked . Hotel rooms , empty , not occupied . Empty tables in restaurants , rental cars not rented . Flowers not arranged , airline flights not flown , cabs not taken . Things like thousands of visiting friends and family who wo n't be visiting California , for celebrations not happening . <p> So , in these economic times , who needs all that extra business anyway . Vote " yes " on 8 . Be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - On my partner 's way to work , he had the great misfortune of finding a couple of the " Yes on Prop 8 " signs tossed into the street . First and foremost I must state that I am a firm opponent of Proposition 8 . I have a " No on 8 " sign in my front yard . <p> I think that it is shameful and completely un-American to step on someone 's private property and violate that homeowner 's right to free speech . Taking something off of a piece of private property is not free speech ; it is vandalism and should be prosecuted to the full extent of the law . <p> We live in the United States of America , and I am dismayed that there are citizens out there that feel it is OK to tramp on the basic freedom of speech that we are all supposed to be able to enjoy . <p> DAVID HARTLEY <p> Livermore <p> Editor - Recently , vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin again called Sen. Barack Obama ' s tax plan " socialism . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' s proposed tax plan would lower the taxes of the 95 percent of us earning less than $250,000 and increase the taxes on the remaining 5 percent . Remember , the top 1 percent in this country is estimated to own between 33 to 40 percent of the nation 's wealth , or close to the combined wealth of the bottom 95 percent . <p> Since 1913 , the federal tax code has used a progressive formula whereby the rich pay a higher percentage in taxes . Thus , one aim of our federal tax code is to redistribute wealth and , by the way , it 's not doing a very good job of it . Thus , if Obama ' s tax proposal is a socialist redistribution of wealth , then the U.S. has engaged in socialism for 95 years , since 1913 . But let 's not confuse Sen. John McCain and Sarah Palin with these facts . <p> RALPH E. STONE San Francisco <p> Editor - The last sentence of your editorial " Pray as you go , " Oct. 22 shows a lack of understanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to lull the masses to sleep . You say " The next president will need to find a way to pay back the enormous federal borrowing that 's behind the rescue plans . " <p> The way to pay back the borrowings is simple ; the federal government needs to run a surplus . A surplus has only happened rarely in the last few decades and certainly is an impossibility under a Congress and executive branch controlled by Democrats . <p> The country is close to a tipping point , at which more people will receive benefits , but pay no taxes . The number is currently over 40 percent , and will jump further when a President Obama ' s cash credits remove 18 million more voters from the tax rolls . Currently , the 5 percent of the people who earn $250,000 or more pay 60 percent of income taxes . <p> Obama ' s plans will grievously disappoint his followers , as he will be forced to raise more taxes on ever lower income levels . With his trillion dollars of new spending planned , and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no way the deficit will be materially cut , if at all . <p> At some point , the incentives to work hard will be diminished and our unemployment rate will insidiously rise , as has been the case in Europe for years . <p> ANDREW FINE <p> Concord <p> Editor - As a San Francisco Superior Court judge , I am extremely troubled by the campaign of Gerardo Sandoval for a seat on the San Francisco Superior Court bench . <p> In his ads and flyers , Sandoval seeks votes because he is a Democrat . <p> In California , all judges are non-partisan officials . A judge is required to follow the rules of law impartially and without consideration of politics . The California Code of Judicial Ethics , binding on all California judges , provides that " A judge shall be faithful to the law regardless of partisan interests " and that judges must " avoid political activity that may create the appearance of political bias . " <p> Candidates for judicial office should be evaluated on their integrity , character , judgment , intellectual capacity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisiveness , ability to transcend personal biases , professional ability and knowledge of the law . Using these criteria , the San Francisco Bar Association has determined that Sandoval is not qualified to be a Superior Court judge . <p> I urge all San Franciscans to reject Sandoval 's partisan assault on the impartiality of the judiciary . <p> HAROLD KAHN San Francisco <p> Editor - A small chorus of Americans prefer Sarah Palin because " she is like us " and thus genuine and plainspoken , while imparting a can-do attitude . <p> Those same voters question Sen. Barack Obama ' s authenticity because he is intellectual , reflective and talks like a " professor . " <p> But nowhere in this love of the homely and familiar is there recognition that we are voting for a president and vice president to lead us through a very precarious time in a chaotically complex world , not run the cakewalk at the carnival . <p> It 's natural to be drawn to people we identify with , but does that mean they are the best choice to solve the economic crisis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift close ? Americans are already known abroad for being unworldly and anti-intellectual . Now is not the time to worsen that embarrassing reputation . <p> ANDY CROCKETT <p> Alameda <p> Editor - As a mass transit commuter and frequent traveler along our Golden State , I am excited about the chance to experience the first high-speed rail system in the U.S. " New way of life needed to run high-speed rail , " Oct 20 . <p> But when the system is a reality and Californians take to the new trains en masse , it 's also an opportunity for the state to maintain high ridership by setting a precedent for a positive transit experience . <p> Have you taken Muni or BART lately ? Basic infractions like littering , loud cell phone conversations and shoving onto trains are all too common on short , local transit rides and would certainly put the brakes on any chance of a pleasant 2 1/2-hour ride from San Francisco to Los Angeles . <p> So if high-speed rail wants to fly in California with a bit of common courtesy , I encourage all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , where the authors remind us how to enjoy the journey and not just the destination . <p> GENNA MORI <p> San Francisco <p> Editor - Lions and tigers and big government , oh my ! Government budgets did n't get any smaller under Ronald Reagan or under President Bush . Governmental functions were simply privatized , up to and including our military . <p> The notion that the " private sector " can operate more efficiently has proved false , no surprise when profits are an integral part of the picture . Military contractors in Iraq have been a disaster . Loss of our community hospitals and shifting health care from doctors to insurance companies have made our health care system one of the most expensive , least functional in the world . Charter schools cherry-pick their student body , operate with fewer standards and regulation and drain money from public education . <p> There are duties and responsibilities most appropriately fulfilled by government at local , state and national levels . These include streets and highways , police and fire , courts , schools , parks and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banks and stock markets . <p> It should not include subsidies for businesses such as oil drilling , agribusiness , coal mining , timber cutting or any other such profit-making entity . <p> What we need is efficient government , as big as it needs to be to fulfill its constitutional mandate to promote the general welfare . <p> L.M.
