Jane and the Barque of Frailty By Stephanie Barron Bantam Stephanie Barron A Night Among the Ton No. 64 Sloane Street , London Monday , 22 April 1811 CONCEIVE , IF YOU WILL , OF THE THEATRE ROYAL , COVENT Garden , on an evening such as this : the celebrated Mrs. Siddons being rumoured to appear , after too many months ' absence from the stage ; the play Macbeth , with all the hideous power of Shakespeare 's verse and Sarah Siddons 's art ; and the Polite World of London brawling in the midst of Bow Street , in an effort to reach its place in the box before the curtain should rise . Such a welter of chairmen , link boys , fashionable carriages , street sweeps , porters , and coachmen ! Such oaths , blasted into the ears of delicately-nurtured females , carried hurriedly to the paving lest their satin slippers should be soiled in the horses ' dung ! Such an array of silks and muslins , turbans and feathers , embroidered shawls and jewelled flounces ! The scent of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ripe oranges and fish from the markets in Covent Garden , the great theatre 's windows thrown open against the warmth of the spring night and the heat of too many bodies filling the vast hall ! The flickering of wax candles , a fortune 's worth thrown up into the gleaming chandeliers ; the rising pitch of conversation , the high screech of a woman 's laughter , the impropriety of a chance remark , the hand of a gentleman restingwhere it should not , on the person of his lady -- all this , like a prodigal feast spread out for my delectation . The vague shadow , too , of a Bow Street Runner lounging in the doorway of the magistrate 's offices opposite -- which I chanced to glimpse as brother Henry swept me to the theatre door ; lounging like an accusation as he surveyed the Fashionable Great , whose sins and peccadilloes only he may be privileged to know . It is a scene hardly out of the ordinary way for the majority of the ton , that select company of wealthy and wellborn who rule what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of her thirty-fifth year , denied a proper come-out or a breathless schoolgirl 's first Season , a shabby-genteel lady long since on the shelf and at her last prayers -- it must be deemed a high treat . Add that I am a hardened enthusiast of the great Sarah Siddons , and have been disappointed before in my hopes of seeing her tread the boards -- and you will apprehend with what pleasurable anticipation I met the curtain 's rise.1 " Jane , " Eliza murmured behind her fan as the Theatre Royal fell silent , " there is Lord Moira , Henry 's particular friend and an intimate of the Prince Regent . Next his box you will recognise Lord Castlereagh , I am sure -- was there ever anything so elegant as his lady 's dress ? It is as nothing , however , to the costume of the creature seated to our left -- the extraordinarily handsome woman with the flashing dark eyes and the black curls . That is the great Harriette Wilson , my dear -- the most celebrated Impure in London , with her sisters and intimate friends ; do not observe her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in keeping ! I am sure our Harriette might bring down the Government , were she merely to speak too freely among her intimates . They do say that even Wellington --  " The pressure of Henry 's hand upon his wife 's arm silenced Eliza , and I was allowed to disregard the men of government equally with the demimondaine in her rubies and paint , and sit in breathless apprehension as a cabal of witches plotted their ageless doom . I am come to London in the spring of this year 1811 -- the year of Regency and the poor old King 's decline into madness , the year of Buonaparte 's expected rout in the Peninsula , of straitened circumstances and immense want among the poor -- to watch like an anxious parent over the printing of my first novel . Yes , my novel ; or say rather the child of my heart , which is to be sent into the Great World without even the acknowledgement of its mother , being to be published by Mr. Thomas Egerton only as By a Lady . And what is the title and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fancy of ladies both young and old ? I have been used to call it Elinor &; Marianne , after the fashion of the great Madame d'Arblay , whose exemplary tales Camilla , Evelina , Cecilia , etc. , have set the fashion in literature for ladies . Mr. Egerton , however , is of the opinion that such a title is no longer the mode , the style being for qualities akin to Mrs. Brunton 's Self-Controul . I have debated the merits of Worthiness and Self-Worth , or An Excellent Understanding . Eliza , on the other hand , would hew to the sensational . " How do you like The Bodice Rip 'd from Side to Side , Jane ? Or perhaps -- I think now only of Marianne -- The Maid Forsworn and All Forlorn ? " " But what of Willoughby ? " brother Henry objected . " Should he not be given pride of place ? Call it then The Seducer , and have done . " " It shall be Sense and Sensibility , " I replied firmly , " for I am partial to sibilants ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creature of Reason , and Marianne entirely of Feeling . You must know I am in the habit of being guided by my sister .  - -  Insofar as my inclination allies with hers , of course . " Henry and his wife cried out against this , abusing Cassandra for the excessive starch of her notions , and the quiet propriety which must always characterise my sister 's views . I ought possibly to have paid more heed to their opinions -- it is Henry , after all , who has franked me in the publishing world , having paid Mr. Egerton to print my little book -- but I am tired of toying with titles . All my anxiety is for the pace of the printing , which is excessively slow . I am resident in London a full month , and yet we have arrived only at Chapter Nine , and Willoughby 's first appearance . At this rate , the year will have turned before the novel is bound , tho ' it was faithfully promised for May -- a set of three volumes in blue boards , with gilt letters . " Jane , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Macbeth , " you are hardly attending . Here is the Comtesse d'Entraigues come to pay us a call . How delightful ! " I roused myself quick enough to observe that lady 's entrance into our box , with a headdress of feathers nearly sweeping the ceiling -- a quizzing-glass held to her eye -- an expanse of bony shoulder and excess of dcollet -- and schooled my countenance to amiability . There are many words I might chuse to apostrophise the French Countess -- one of Eliza 's acquaintances from her previous marriage to a nobleman of Louis 's reign -- but delightful is not one of them . The Comtesse d'Entraigues was used to be known as Anne de St.-Huberti , when she set up as an opera singer in the days of the Revolution ; but by either name she is repugnant to me , being full of acid and spite . Eliza hints that her friend was the Comte 's mistress before he was constrained to marry her -- and at full five-and-fifty , Anne de St.-Huberti must be grateful for the protection of d'Entraigues 's name . She paints her pitted cheeks in the mode of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scent ; affects a blond wig ; and should undoubtedly be termed a Fright by the ruthless bucks of Town . " Eliza , mignon , " she crooned as she presented one powdered cheek in all the appearance of affection ; " how hagged you look this evening , to be sure ! The years , they have never sat lightly upon you , bien sur ! You have been fatigued , sans doute , by your visit to Surrey last evening -- it was a great deal too good of you to solace my exile ! " We had indeed ventured into Surrey last night , despite all my doubts regarding Sunday travel , to enjoy an evening of music at the d'Entraigues abode . The old Count spoke nothing but French , and I understood but a fraction of the communication , tho ' Henry admirably held up his end , and declared the gentleman to be a man of parts and considerable information . The son , young Count Julien , who appears everything an Exquisite of the Ton should be , with his excellent tailoring , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fobs and seals , delighted us with his superior performance upon the pianoforte . The Comtesse had deigned to sing . Taken all together , I should rather endure a full two hours of her ladyship 's airs in the Italian than a few moments of her conversation ; and as she and Eliza put their heads together , I considered instead how the Theatre Royal might serve in a novel : the comings and goings of great personages , a lady 's chance encounter with an Unknown ; or the appearance of a Rogue , for example , who might interpret the slight nothings and subtle displays of the ton with an understanding far more penetrating than my own . . . It was impossible to be in London at the height of the Season without reverting in thought to Lord Harold Trowbridge . That late denizen of Brooks 's Club , that consummate sportsman and intimate of princes , should certainly have graced one of these lofty boxes , and been in close converse even now with Lord Castlereagh , perhaps , however little he liked that Tory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the play 's interval in dallying with a lady , or shown himself one of Harriette Wilson 's favorites , his sleek frame displayed to advantage against the marble columns of the tier . But would he , in truth , have noticed Jane ? The question arose with a pang . At five-and-thirty I can not pretend to any beauty now . My evening dress of blue , the beaded band encircling my forehead , the flower tucked into my hair -- arranged with all the genius Eliza 's French maid could command -- is yet nothing to draw the eye . One must be possessed of extraordinary looks or a great deal of money to figure in London . Had his lordship lived , he might have called at No. 64 Sloane Street , as he condescended to do in Bath and Southampton -- and left his card as my Willoughby does for Marianne -- but in the Greater World Lord Harold 's notice may have been denied to me . I like to think , however , that he would have approved of my book . It was always an object with Lord Harold that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my brother Henry enquired gently as he reappeared in the box . " We have been leading you quite the dance these past few weeks . I daresay you 're wishing yourself back in Hampshire ! " " Not at all , " I replied , banishing my ghost with effort . " You know me too well for a frivolous character , Henry , to imagine me ungrateful when such divine absurdities are laid at my feet ! What writer worthy of the name should prefer the confined and unvarying circle of the country to this ? Only observe Eliza 's French count , old d'Entraigues , paying court before Mr. George Canning -- and he no longer Foreign Minister , with favours to bestow . Observe Lady Castlereagh endeavouring to ignore the fact that Beau Brummell and the Ponsonbys prefer Harriette Wilson 's box to hers ! But tell me -- who is that woman with the aquiline nose and jewelled tiara , quite alone in the seat opposite ? She can not tear her regard from Lord Castlereagh . I should consider her excessively rude , did I not imagine her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond all censure . " " A princess indeed , " my brother replied with a careless gesture of his quizzing-glass , " but not of the Hanoverian line . You have detected a Russian noblewoman , my dear -- the Princess Evgenia Tscholikova . She is resident in London nearly a year , and may be claimed as one of our neighbours -- for she has taken a house in Hans Place , hard by Sloane Street . " " A princess , rusticating in the oblivion of Hans Place ! " I declared . " I should rather have expected Berkeley Square , or Brook Street at the very least . " " Her means , no doubt , are unequal to her station . " " But why does she gaze at Lord Castlereagh so earnestly ? His lady certainly does not notice the Princess ; and the gentleman is deep in conversation with another . " " That is like Evgenia , " broke in the Comtesse d'Entraigues , with a disparaging glance at me over her bare shoulder . " The Princess will always be playing the tragic actress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become the most ardent object of her soul . " Eliza rapped her friend 's knuckles with a furled fan . " You will shock my sister , Anne . Do not be letting your tongue run away with you , I beg . " " But surely you have seen the papers , Eliza ? " The Comtesse 's voice was immoderately loud ; several heads turned . " It is everywhere in the Morning Post , if one has eyes to see and the mind to understand . The Princess 's letters to Castlereagh -- most importunate and disgusting , the very abasement of a woman in the throes of love -- were sold to the Post but a few days ago . The editors would disguise the principals in the affair , of course -- as ' Lord C --  --  , ' and ' the Princess T --  --  , ' but the truth is known among the ton . Evgenia has disgraced herself and his lordship . Lord Castlereagh has only to conduct himself as usual , to silence the impertinent ; but I wonder that she dares to show her face . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse enemy than the Comtesse d'Entraigues I should not like to encounter , and of a sudden my sympathy went out to the Russian noblewoman , who alone among the Great at the Theatre Royal was lapped in a chilly solitude , no friend to support her . I , too , had read the salacious excerpts in the Morning Post , but lacking all familiarity with the ton , had no ability to put a name or face to the initials . My cheeks flushed with consciousness as I recalled a part of the correspondence . My limbs burn with the desire to lie once more entangled in your own . . . There is nothing I would not sacrifice , would not risk , for the touch of your lips on my bare skin . . . I can hardly write for anguish , I tremble at the slightest glimpse of you in publick , my dear one , desperate to have you alone . . . However abandoned the prose , it was vile to consider of it strewn before the publick eye . " What I desire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who should undertake to traffick in a lady 's intimate correspondence ? " " Her maid , perhaps -- if the girl was turned off without a character , " suggested Eliza . " But Castlereagh was the recipient of the letters , " Henry objected , " which must point to a culprit in his lordship 's household . " " Unless he returned the Princess 's correspondence , " I offered . " I will lay odds on it that she sold them herself , " the Comtesse d'Entraigues pronounced viciously . " She would enjoy the fame , however black . " " You are acquainted with the lady , I apprehend . " " Twenty years , at least . She has the habit of inserting herself in my affairs ; I will not deny that I abhor the very sight of her . " The Comtesse rose abruptly , smoothed out her silk gown , and said , " Eliza , I will wait upon you in Sloane Street tomorrow . Do not fail me . " Eliza bowed her head in acknowledgement , and the Comtesse swept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and all further conversation being impossible in the presence of Sarah Siddons , and the blood that stained her hands .
