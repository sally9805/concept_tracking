A tempest broke across the end of the dining room . Signified by a terrible hammering on metal sheets , the raging storm tossed sailors across a makeshift deck and into blue-painted waves surging where the banquet table ended . The impression of watery peril created by the acrobats tumbling around the motionless wooden stage was too realistic for John . While a mercenary in Bretania , the man who would eventually become Lord Chamberlain to the Emperor Justinian had seen a comrade in arms drown in a swollen stream and barely escaped with his own life . He averted his gaze only to realize his plate was graced with liver forcemeat molded into the shape of a fish . " Uncle Zeno should have arranged to borrow one of those thunder-making machines from the theater , " remarked his neighbor , a young man with dark hair and the regular features of a classical Greek statue . " It does n't really sound as if heaven 's sending a real storm . It 's more like a rapping on the front door . " Recognizing his friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wan smile . It was , after all , just a play . Not a matter of life and death . The mock storm intensified and the room darkened as servants covered the lamps . The wall behind the reeling acrobats had been concealed by curtains painted with a seascape to match the long room 's frescoes of underwater life . The diners might have been reclining at the bottom of the Sea of Marmara . If true it would have been a great loss to the empire considering the number of senators , prominent landholders and high churchmen amongst them , not to mention Empress Theodora . As she stared raptly from her richly upholstered couch at the head of the table , her eyes gleamed like pearls in the light streaming from the illuminated stage . Around the edge of the room shadowy figures moved quietly and John 's keen hearing picked up the whisper of a sword drawn from a scabbard . Guards , he well knew , were always wary of darkness . The smothered lamps filled the room with smoke . Its acrid odor mingled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The food might have complemented the room 's marine motif except that all had been grilled or broiled in pungent sauces . " A shame the twins ca n't be here . " Anatolius took a bite from a newly arrived delicacy . " After all , this fete at Uncle Zeno 's estate is in their honor . They will be sorry to miss it , the more so as I overheard my uncle telling them tall tales this afternoon . He claimed the whale they 've seen occasionally from the beach was going to come ashore and dine with us . I think he had himself half-convinced by the time he 'd finished . The children did n't believe a word . They were just disappointed they 'd be the last to see this new contraption , the mechanical whale that my uncle commissioned . " He paused for another bite . " I believe this delicious dish is mullet in quince sauce . " John nodded without interest . He would have been happier with cheese and bread . " I understand that Gadaric and Sunilda will see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight-year-olds . " Anatolius remarked that seemed a sensible idea . " Yes , especially as the writer of this current spectacle seems to have placed a great deal of emphasis on the fleshly evils of Nineveh . " The acrobats had been temporarily replaced on stage by a bevy of undulating dancers . Anatolius grinned . " If I 'd been Jonah , any one of those tempestuous girls could have convinced me to be off to Nineveh at once . There 'd be no need for storms at sea to persuade me . " His enthusiastic utterances were cut short by a sudden bout of snuffling . " Mithra ! " he muttered . " The country air is bad enough and now with the smoke in here " He sneezed thunderously , as if heralding the prophet who finally appeared , stepping from behind the curtains as the dancers fled . If John had ever thought about Jonahwhich until this evening he scarcely had , being like Anatolius a worshipper of the soldier 's god Mithrahe would not have envisioned him as a muscular dwarf . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the empress , and thus for this performance at least , the perfect Jonah . " And just as well he 's so small , " Zeno had confided earlier . " Anyone else would have difficulty fitting inside the whale . " Barnabas now proceeded to demonstrate how he had gained his considerable reputation in Constantinople , staggering about the stage in a convincing portrayal of a man still groggy with sleep and horrified by a storm-tossed ship . " Oh , ah , " he wailed . " How I wish I had gone to Nineveh ! " For a heartbeat the room was silent . Then Theodora let out a cawing laugh and the other diners , who had been uncertain as to whether they should be regarding this ludicrous prophet with the solemnity befitting his position , immediately joined in . " Look at the empress , " whispered Anatolius . " When she forgets her rank she looks like any spirited girl , but Mithra help anyone who mistakes the appearance for the reality ! " Now the sailors and Barnabas were engaged in violent fisticuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jonah 's Lord in vain in increasingly inventive , not to say obscene , ways only to be patiently rebuked and beaten around their heads by the small but athletic prophet . " Uncle insisted my play contain some didactic elements , " explained Anatolius . John shot him an amused glance . " This wonderful work is your writing ? " " Do you think I should claim a reward from the empress for its entertainment value ? " the other replied , unabashed . At last Jonah was overcome and cast flailing and screaming into the painted waves . The sailors vanished and an exceptionally tall , gaunt figure sitting in the shadows at the back of the room stood and with obvious reluctance mounted the brightly lit stage . The man 's expression was grim as he began to speak . " So they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea and the sea ceased from its raging . " His intonation was that of a prelate , John thought . The man had to raise his voice to be heard over the titters and muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' performance . He glared out at the unruly audience and very quickly there was silence . " Now , " he continued , " whilst the servants are bringing in the final course of this excellent repast , it might be fruitful to take the time to contemplate the consequences of Jonah 's refusal to do the Lord 's bidding . What is the message we may all draw as we await the Final Course which our host in Heaven has surely prepared for each one of us ? " Already Zeno 's servants had relit the lamps and were bustling around the long table , removing empty plates and bringing further new delicacies . " That is n't the speech I wrote for him , John , " Anatolius complained . " He was supposed to announce the dramatic finale that 's planned . This is what you get with a man of religion . " " He is n't an actor ? He looks and sounds so much the holy man , I thought he must be playing the part . " John rose from his couch to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cramps in his legs . Many of the diners were doing the same , strolling around the room , some still laughing over Barnabas ' antics . Others took their opportunity to escape the smoky atmosphere and catch a breath of air in the garden . Before long , however , all had resumed their places , the lamps were dimmed again , and the rawboned prelate , looking even more irritable than before , continued his remarks . " Yes , " he began , " the sailors threw headstrong Jonah into the sea . Then the Lord provided a great fish to swallow up Jonah who was in the belly of that fish for three days and nights . " As he stepped down from the stage , most of the lamps illuminating it were extinguished . The eerie trill of flutes filled the air but could not hide the shrill squeal and clank of machinery . " Now you 'll see a real wonder , " Anatolius whispered . " Uncle 's been telling me all about it , and if it can do half of what he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sign of pulleys or any other device , a large , shadowy shape , taller than a man , rolled forward . It was a great whale . The room 's remaining light limned its broad , gray back and enormous flukes and gleamed off the huge glassy eyes set on either side of its head . An admiring murmur rose from the audience as the beast 's tail , moving slowly from side to side , emerged from the curtains . It was apparent that no agent propelled the leviathan from behind . Indeed , it continued forward on its own as if truly alive . There were gasps , and John tensed as the great head moved out over the edge of the stage . However , just as it appeared the whale would swim straight into the diners , it came to an abrupt halt . There was a hissing noise . The whale spouted . To the startled exclamations of the audience , a jet of water burst up from the contraption 's head and descended in a cloud of droplets that caught the dim light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting near the end of the table , felt mist against his face . The flutes keened more urgently , underscored by a new sound , a clanking and ratcheting . Slowly and majestically , the whale 's mouth opened a crack . Through a fence of huge bronze teeth brilliant light poured out across the banquet table to flash and coruscate along gold and silver bowls . Anatolius could not contain his enthusiasm . " The beast 's lit up inside like the Hagia Sophia , " he declared with delight . " Uncle 's really outdone himself this time . " The whale 's maw opened yet further , spilling more brightness into the room . Laughs and shouts filled the air . No one doubted what the climax would beBarnabas would leap forth , freeing himself from the creature 's belly with a huge bound . The jaws stopped moving . Barnabas did not appear . John squinted into the fierce light inside the whale . " He 's waiting , for better dramatic effect when he finally appears , " he heard Anatolius say knowledgeably . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whale amid blazing oil lamps set in the floor and the walls of the beast 's head . The shape lay motionless , crumpled on the stuffed red linen tongue . John jumped from his couch and strode to the stage . The clatter of armor and weapons accompanied him as guards moved forward quickly . As he neared the whale he could see the face of the small , limp figure with the horribly mangled neck . It was not Barnabas . " It is the boy , Gadaric , " John said into the quiet that had descended upon the room . Then , before he could attempt to reach between the jaws to retrieve the child 's body , the huge mouth began to close irresistibly , cutting off its lamplight . Semi-darkness descended as the mechanical leviathan , insensitive to the tragedy , rolled smoothly backwards and vanished behind the painted curtains . * * * " Barnabas ! What 's happened to Barnabas ? " John turned in the direction of the agitated voice . The distraught speaker , amazingly , was the usually controlled Theodora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Zeno , a slight man , bird-like . His hair , still dark , hung down his back . John noticed , to his horror , that the scholarly old dreamer was trying to calm the empress by gently patting her arm as if she were some young servant . John moved forward quickly , diverting her attention to himself . " Lord Chamberlain ! " Theodora said . " Perhaps you have an explanation for this strange exhibition ? " The cold expression in her hooded eyes suggested it would be best if he did . " It is the boy Gadaric who is dead , Empress , " he replied with a slight bow . " Not Barnabas . " " Gadaric ? Then explain to me , where is Barnabas ? " " Highness , " Zeno offered her a sweet , vague smile , " perhaps he has had to return suddenly to the city ? " Theodora regarded him with incredulity . " Do you think , " she began , pointing a slender finger at the elderly man , " that I am merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand nothing ? " Her face reddened under its cosmetic chalk and her eyes glittered with anger . John had rarely seen her in such a rage . Anatolius advanced to the group . " Highness , " the young man began , doubtless fearful for the safety of his uncle , under whose roof this outrage had occurred . " May I ... " The empress ignored him . " Lord Chamberlain , you will find Barnabas , and you will find him quickly . Furthermore , when Barnabas reappears , he 'd be wise to have a very convincing explanation as to why he has so sorely disappointed me by departing from this festive occasion without my permission . " The room had fallen so silent that John could hear the rustle of Theodora 's stiff robes as she stepped closer . " But if you are unable to locate him , " she went on with a smile that was more a snarl , " you 'd best have an excellent reason as to why you failed in your search . A child has died in my presence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it is of course " she turned and laid her hand on Zeno 's shoulder , visibly startling him , " an equally intolerable slur on my dear host 's hospitality . " " Indeed , highness , " John agreed . " But if I may inquire , is it possible that you can reveal anything concerning Barnabas that may " " You may not inquire , Lord Chamberlain . " Theodora 's voice was very low . " I do not concern myself with the private affairs of mimes . " John looked away from her cold glare . Zeno 's guests were standing in clusters near the painted walls , silent or speaking in whispers , afraid to approach the furious empress and equally frightened to leave without her permission . The guards who had failed to prevent the tragedy stood with swords drawn but without an enemy to confront . Then he thought of one who was not present , forgotten momentarily as everyone kept their attention fixed on the enraged empress and her missing mime . " Sunilda ! " John shouted to the guard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
