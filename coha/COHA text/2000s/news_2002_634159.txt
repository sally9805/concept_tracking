<p> SALT LAKE CITY  --  Another night , another ice flap , another round of boos in the arena . Only this time , your loser was the American cover boy , Apolo Ohno , whose Olympic debut ended with a bump and grind in the night , followed by a 15-yard butt slide over the finish line for the strangest , wettest , wildest silver-medal effort you 'll ever see . <p> Nothing can happen cleanly at the Wacky Winter Games . The controversy bug even sticks to Ohno , whose goal of four golds evaporated in the final lap of the 1,000-meter competition in short-track speedskating . Looking like a champion , Ohno got caught in a chain-reaction , multi-skater collision as he elbowed and tangled with China 's Li Jiajun , who was pinching in and jostling as they raced into the final corner . Next thing you knew , Ohno was facing his own little plot twist in the Salt Lake Ice Center , where the screams of 15,000 fans turned to shrieks of confusion . <p> Paging Jacques Rogge . Should we give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fender-benders like this . First , the Chinese skater fell into the back of Ohno 's legs . Then you had one of Ohno 's arch-rival Koreans , Ahn Hyun-soo , stumbling and falling in front of Ohno 's path  --  purposely , I 'd say  --  and tackling him in a way that would make football coaches proud . With four of the five skaters sprawled on the ice surface , including Canada 's Mathieu Turcotte , Ohno scrambled to his feet and still tried to make it to the finish line first . But Australian Steven Bradbury , strategically lagging far behind the pack , merrily maneuvered through the wreckage and won the gold in a slow 1:29.109 . <p> Welcome to demolition derby on ice , which would be a hoot if Ohno did n't enter the interview room Saturday night with six stitches in his left thigh . He said he expects to be healthy by his next event Wednesday . Until then , we 'll be seeing replays of his slip-slide forward , like a kid learning to skate , literally skidding over the line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skater , was disqualified by officials . And suddenly , the Salt Lake Games had yet another conversation piece , with a common headline in U.S. newspapers today : " OH-NO ! " <p> The first jingoistic instinct , I 'm sure , is to blame the Chinese and Korean skaters . Bradbury , who had the best view of the dustup , refused to blame anyone . Ohno initiated at least some of the contact , leading to a tumble that caused a large gash on the inner thigh of his left leg . Asked if he was to blame , he grinned . <p> " No , not at all . I was in front , " Ohno said . " When someone falls in front of you and falls into you , there 's nothing you can do . I have to look at the tape . " <p> Li was n't blaming Ohno , the sport 's superstar . " I felt high pressure at the last turn and my hand got tangled a bit with Apolo Ohno , " he said . " It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Ohno was n't upset as much as relieved to have a medal , saying he plans to compete in his three remaining Olympic events . Though he was pushed into the arena in a wheelchair , you could n't tell he was hurt when he jumped up and down in front of a raucous crowd . <p> " My performance was one of the best of my life , " he said . " I skated exactly how I wanted . Unfortunately , I got taken out in the last corner . But this is short track . This is the sport I live for , and sometimes , things get out of control . I got a silver medal , so I ca n't complain . After that , I 'm just happy to come out with any medal . " <p> It is a dangerous sport , Ohno emphasized . " I 'm just lucky the injury was n't more serious than it was , " he said . Those who 've never seen short track should think NASCAR on skates , with racers flying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rules call for no blocking or body contact , but it still takes tremendous skill , strength and agility not to wipe out . That 's why Ohno was n't buying into the hype and downplaying comparisons to long-form speedskater Eric Heiden , the only Olympian ever to win as many as five golds in a single Games . He knows his sport leaves no room for error . One slip on a hairpin turn , one freak collision , and first place can become a butt slide . <p> " It 's impossible . It 's short track , " Ohno said of a four-gold harvest . " Anything can happen . I 've got to go through prelims , heats , semis , quarters , before you even get to the final . If I make one mistake or if I 'm a hundredth of a second too late in a pass , then the race is over . So you definitely have to have the golden horseshoe if you 're going to win four . " <p> Bradbury accepted the gold , Australia 's first ever in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's good , but it does n't make you feel right , you know ? " he said . " I consider myself the luckiest man . God smiles on you some day . " <p> In a way , it figured . You do n't exactly hum the Olympic theme when Ohno races . You do n't envision a Bud Greenspan docudrama or think of Bonnie Blair and Dan Jansen , homespun heartlanders with aw-shucks smiles . Face reality , folks : The kid is a former juvenile delinquent who dedicated himself to short track only after his father , a hairdresser , threatened to disown him and banished him to a week of solitary confinement in a remote cabin . <p> That said , Ohno is OUR former juvenile delinquent , a 5-7 daredevil with a soul patch who still might knock down the world at these Winter Games . You do n't have to like his past , which includes recent charges of race-fixing  --  later ruled unfounded in a typically bizarre decision  --  that allowed his teammate and good friend , Chicagoan Shani Davis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But despite this chaos , you still have to like his chances of doing pretty well here and leaving his imprint on Salt Lake memory banks , which would be one small step for Roller Derby on Ice , one giant leap for Generation Limp Bizkit . <p> The Olympics always produce unique stories , but Ohno 's stands alone , sounding like a segment from a sports version of VH1 's " Behind the Music . " He grew up a wayward kid , hanging out with gangbangers who skipped class to drink , steal and plot schemes such as blowing up toilets in school . His divorced father , Japanese-born Yuki Ohno , was torn between a glamorous career as a jetsetting hair stylist and raising a son . Admittedly , he felt he had failed as a dad when a rebellious Apolo began hanging with the wrong crowd . <p> " Anything you can name , they were into , " Ohno said of his old pals . " The lifestyle I was living was n't healthy . I was rebelling against my dad . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continuing efforts to channel him into sports . Together , they watched the 1994 Lillehammer Games , which is when Apolo became fascinated by a newfangled sport called short track . Eight years later , he is the talk of the nation . <p> Though hardly as he planned it . Somewhere , Don King , Vince McMahon and Dick Ebersol are laughing .
