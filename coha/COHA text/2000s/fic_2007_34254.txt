1 Sub Sandwich You could attend Emerson Hicky Elementary for a long time without knowing its substitute teachers . And you could know its subs for a long time without meeting Barbara Dwyer . And that would be just swell . Barb Dwyer was a sourpuss porcupine with a face like a bucket of mud . From the tips of her many quills to the shapeless hat on her head , she was a surly sub , and she did n't care who knew it . I could have gone my whole life without meeting her . But because Mr. Ratnose called in sick one gray Wednesday , we were stuck with the dame . Through math and English classes she had ridden us hard , like a rhino going piggyback on a house cat . We were taking a breather , doing some silent reading . Most of the kids favored Winnie the Poobah , our assignment . I had slipped the latest Amazing Mantis-Man comic book inside old Winnie . Private eyes like to live dangerously . A gentle whisper broke my concentration . " Chet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle . I gave her a look . She was worth looking at . Shirley had big green peepers , a curly tail , and a laugh like the pitter-pat of raindrops on daisies . Not that I cared about any of that . She was also a major cootie factory . " Mm ? " I said , glancing back at my comic book . " Do you , um . . . are you going to the fair on Friday ? " Shirley toyed with her scarf , one eye on me , one eye on the substitute teacher . ( Literally . Chameleons have some gross habits . ) I leaned over . " Depends . Will they have clowns ? " " Why ? " she said . " Because I hate clowns . " " Who 's whispering ? " a voice snapped . Ms. Dwyer scanned the room . We clammed up . A minute later , Shirley bent back across the aisle . She batted her eyelashes . " I do n't know about clowns , " she whispered , " but I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it , too-the Hen 's Choice Hoedown , where girls ask boys . " I was trying to forget about that , " I said . Ms. Dwyer thundered , " No more whispering . Eyes on your books ! " Shirley gave it a rest for another minute . Then she murmured , " If you 're , um , going to the fair , maybe you 'd come to the dance with me ? As my date ? " " Your date ? ! " I spluttered , shattering the quiet . " That 's it ! " cried Ms. Dwyer . She waddled up the aisle toward me , quills bristling . " You ! What 's your name ? " Although I wanted to say Seymour Butts , I stuck with the truth . " Chet Gecko . " " You 've disrupted my class enough for one morning . " I let my book drop . " But she- " Ms. Dwyer noticed my Amazing Mantis-Man . " And you 're reading this . . . this trash ? A comic book ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my science report . " " I do n't care if it 's War and frikkety Peace , " she growled . The porcupine held her hand out for the comic . I gave it to her . " You , mister , will sit outside until you learn some manners . " Bo Newt chuckled . " Guess I 'll see ya next year , Chet . " The substitute wheeled on my friend . " Would you like to join him ? " " Uh , no sir , " said Bo . " Ma'am ! " " No sir , ma'am , " said the newt . Ms. Dwyer gritted her teeth , then glared at me . " Well , what are you waiting for ? Go and reflect on your bad behavior . " It 's no use arguing with a walking pincushion . Followed by Shirley 's mournful gaze , I rose and ambled out the door . Five minutes of sitting on the hard cement was enough reflection for any gecko . My tuckus was going to sleep . But the sub let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with joy and freedom . I sighed . Idly , I twirled the tip of my tail . No case to solve , no comic to read . It would be a long , boring timeout . I could n't have been more wrong . Footsteps slapped down the hall . " Chet ! Chet ! " The last thing I expected was my little sister . And yet , there she stood , big as life-Pinky Gecko , first grader and first-rate pain in the tushie . " Little blister , " I said . " What brings you here ? " She frowned . " My feet . But , but . . . how come you 're sitting in the hall ? " " I 'm on guard duty-watching out for cockapoos . " " Cocka-whose ? " she said . " Never mind . " Pinky turned her woeful eyes on me . " Help me , big brother . " I pointed . " Okay , the loony bin is that way . " class=MsoNormal style= " MARGIN : 0in 0in 0pt ; tab-stops : 24.0pt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Mom 's pearls , they 're missing ! " I scratched my head . " Run that by me again ? " " The pearls . " Pinky shuffled her feet . " I , um , borrowed ' em for show-and-tell . " " Smooth move , moth-brain , " I said . " And what , you accidentally flushed them down the john ? " " I 'm not a moth-brain , " she said . " I showed ' em before recess . An ' , an ' when I came back from recess , they . . . disdappeared from my desk ! " I stood . " Have you told your teacher , Miss uh . . . " " Miss Flemm ? I ca n't . " " Why not ? " I asked . Pinky 's lip quivered . " She 'll tell Mom . " " Yeah , so ? " " Mom does n't know I borrowed ' em . " My eyebrows rose . " Ah . " " An ' , an ' , an ' . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lake . Before the waterworks began , I gently placed my hands on her shoulders . " And you want me to find the pearls , is that it ? " She nodded . " Mm-hmm . " I chewed my lip . We 'd had plenty of crime at Emerson Hicky Elementary-cheating , blackmail , vandalism , kids trying to take over the world . But no crook had made it this personal . No crook had ever picked on my family before . My fists clenched . This punk was going down hard , like a skydiving brontosaurus . Why , I 'd even tackle the case for free . But I 'd never let Pinky know that . " You realize if I do this , you 're gon na owe me big-time ? " I said . " We 're talking breakfast in bed , sharing desserts , no hassling me for two-no , three weeks . . . " " A-anything you say . " Pinky sniffed . " Just find the pearls . " I hate to see a reptile cry-even if she 's my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sister , " I said . " I 'm on the case .
