When I got to work that Monday morning I knew something was wrong . Mrs. Idabell Turner 's car was parked in the external lot and there was a light on in her half of bungalow C. It was six-thirty . The teachers at Sojourner Truth Junior High School never came in that early . Even the janitors who worked under me did n't show up until seven-fifteen . I was the supervising senior head custodian . It was up to me to see that everything worked right . That 's why I was almost always the first one on the scene . But not that morning . It was November and the sky had n't quite given up night yet . I approached the bungalow feeling a hint of dread . Images of bodies I 'd stumbled upon in my street life came back to me . But I dismissed them . I was a workingman , versed in floor waxes and bleach  --  not blood . The only weapon I carried was a pocket knife , and it only pierced flesh when I cut the corns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I tried my key but the door was bolted from the inside . Then that damned dog started barking . " Who is it ? " a woman 's voice called . " It 's Mr. Rawlins , Mrs. Turner . Is everything okay ? " Instead of answering she fumbled around with the bolt and then pulled the door open . The little yellow dog was yapping , standing on its spindly back legs as if he were going to attack me . But he was n't going to do a thing . He was hiding behind her blue woolen skirt , making sure that I could n't get at him . " Oh , Mr. Rawlins , " Mrs. Turner said in that breathy voice she had . The adolescent boys of Sojourner Truth took her class just tohear that voice , and to see her figure  --  Mrs. Turner had curves that even a suit of armor could n't hide . The male teachers at school , and the boys ' vice principal , made it a point to pay their respects at her lunch table in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say much about her around me , though , because Mrs. Turner was one of the few Negro teachers at the primarily Negro school . The white men had some dim awareness that it would have been insulting for me if I had to hear lewd comments about her . I appreciated their reserve , but I understood what they were n't saying . Mrs. Idabell Turner was a knockout for any man  --  from Cro-Magnon to Jim Crow . " That your dog ? " I asked . " Pharaoh , " she said to the dog . " Quiet now . This is Mr. Rawlins . He 's a friend . " When he heard my name the dog snarled and bared his teeth . " You know dogs are n't allowed on the property , Mrs. Turner , " I said . " I 'm supposed  --  " " Stop that , Pharaoh , " Idabell Turner whined at the dog . She bent down and let him jump into her arms . " Shhh , quiet now . " She stood up , caressing her little protector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of a Chihuahua . He settled his behind down onto the breast of her caramel-colored cashmere sweater and growled out curses in dog . " Quiet , " Mrs. Turner said . " I 'm sorry , Mr. Rawlins . I would n't have brought him here , but I did n't have any choice . I did n't . " I could tell by the red rims of her eyelids that she 'd been crying . " Well , maybe you could leave him out in the car , " I suggested . Pharaoh growled again . He was a smart dog . " Oh no , I could n't do that . I 'd be worried about him suffocating out there . " " You could crack the window . " " He 's so small I 'd be afraid that he 'd wiggle out . You know he spends all day at home trying to find me . He loves me , Mr. Rawlins . " " I do n't know what to say , Mrs.  --  " " Call me Idabell , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with fabulously long lashes . Her skin was like rich milk chocolate  --  dark , satiny , and smooth . That snarling mutt started looking cute to me . I thought that it was n't such a problem to have your dog with you . It was n't really any kind of health threat . I reached out to make friends with him . He tested my scent  --  and then bit my hand . " Ow ! " " That 's it ! " Idabell shouted as if she were talking to a wayward child . " Come on ! " She took the dwarf mongrel and shoved him into the storage room that connected C2 to C1 . As soon as she closed the door , Pharaoh was scratching to get back in . " I 'm sorry , " she said . " Me too . But you know that dog has got to go . " I held out my hand to her . The skin was broken but it was n't bad . " Has he had his rabies shot ? " " Oh yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me by my injured hand . " Let me help . " We went to the desk at the front of the class . I sat down on the edge of her blotter while she opened the top drawer and came out with a standard teacher 's first-aid box . " You know , dog bites are comparatively pretty clean , " she said . She had a bottle of iodine , a cotton ball , and a flesh-colored bandage  --  flesh-colored , that is , if you had pink flesh . When she dabbed the iodine on my cut I winced , but it was n't because of the sting . That woman smelled good ; clean and fresh , and sweet like the deep forest is sweet . " It 's not bad , Mr. Rawlins . And Pharaoh did n't mean it . He 's just upset . He knows that Holland wants to kill him . " " Kill him ? Somebody wants to kill your dog ? " " My husband . " She nodded and was mostly successful in holding back the tears . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I got back home last night , Holly went out , but when he came back he was going to ... kill Pharaoh . " Mrs. Turner gripped my baby finger . It 's amazing how a man can feel sex anywhere on his body . " He wants to kill your dog ? " I asked in a lame attempt to use my mind , to avoid what my body was thinking . " I waited till he was gone and then I drove here . " Mrs. Turner wept quietly . My hand decided , all by itself , to comfort her shoulder . " Why 's he so mad ? " I should n't have asked , but my blood was moving faster than my mind . " I do n't know , " she said sadly . " He made me do something , and I did it , but afterwards he was still mad . " She put her shoulder against mine while I brought my other hand to rest on her side . The thirty desks in her classroom all faced us attentively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispered in my ear . " He knew what Holly said . He was scared . " Pharaoh whimpered out a sad note from his storage room . Idabell leaned back against my arm and looked up . We might have been slow dancing  --  if there had been music and a band . " I do n't know what to do , " she said . " I ca n't ever go back there . I ca n't . He 's going to be in trouble and I 'll be in it with him . But Pharaoh 's innocent . He has n't done anything wrong . " As she talked she leaned closer . With me sitting on the desk we were near to the same height . Our faces were almost touching . I did n't know what she was talking about and I did n't want to know . I 'd been on good behavior for more than two years . I was out of the streets and had my job with the Los Angeles Board of Education . I took care of my kids , cashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clear of the wrong women too . Maybe I 'd been a little too good . I felt an urge in that classroom , but I was n't going to make the move . That 's when Idabell Turner kissed me . Two years of up early and off to work dissolved like a sugar cube under the tap . " Oh , " she whispered as my lips pressed her neck . " Yes . " The tears were all gone . She looked me in the eye and worked her tongue slowly around with mine . A deep grunt went off in my chest like an underwater explosion . It just came out of me . Her eyes opened wide as she realized how much I was moved . I stood and lifted her up on the desk . She spread her legs and pushed her chest out at me . She said , " They 'll be coming soon , " and then gave me three fast kisses that said this was just the beginning . My pants were down before I could stop myself . As I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Here I am , I 've been waitin ' for you , Ezekiel Porterhouse Rawlins . Take my arms , my legs , my breasts . Take everything , " and I answered in the same language . " They 'll be coming soon , " she said as her tongue pressed my left nipple through thin cotton . " Oh , go slow . " The clock on the wall behind her said that it was seven-oh-two . I 'd come to the door at six forty-nine . Less than a quarter of an hour and I was deeply in the throes of passion . I wanted to thank God  --  or his least favorite angel . " They 'll be coming soon , " she said , the phonograph of her mind on a skip . " Oh , go slow . " The desks all sat at attention . Pharaoh whimpered from his cell . " Too much , " she hissed . I did n't know what she meant . When the desk started rocking I did n't care who might walk into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of accrued pension and my two weeks a year vacation for the few moments of ecstasy that teased and tickled about five inches below my navel . " Mr. Rawlins ! " she cried . I lifted her from the desk , not to perform some silly acrobatics but because I needed to hold her tight to my heart . I needed to let her know that this was what I 'd wanted and needed for two years without knowing it . It all came out in a groan that was so loud and long that later on , when I was alone , I got embarrassed remembering it . I stood there holding her aloft with my eyes closed . The cool air of the room played against the back of my thighs and I felt like laughing . I felt like sobbing too . What was wrong with me ? Standing there half naked in a classroom on a weekday morning . Idabell had her arms around my neck . I did n't even feel her weight . If we were at my house I would have carried her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me down , " she whispered . I squeezed her . " Please , " she said , echoing the word in my own mind . I put her back on the desk . We looked at each other for what seemed like a long time  --  slight tremors going through our bodies now and then . I could n't bear to pull away . She had a kind of stunned look on her face . When I leaned over to kiss her forehead I experienced a feeling that I 'd known many times in my life . It was that feeling of elation before I embarked on some kind of risky venture . In the old days it was about the police and criminals and the streets of Watts and South Central L.A. But not this time . Not again . I swallowed hard and gritted my teeth with enough force to crack stone . I 'd slipped but I would not fall . Mrs. Turner was shoving her panties into a white patent-leather purse while I zipped my pants . She smiled and went to open the door for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his legs and his behind dragging on the floor . I felt somehow triumphant over that little rat dog , like I had taken his woman and made him watch it . It was an ugly feeling but , I told myself , he was just a dog . Mrs. Turner picked Pharaoh up and held him while looking into my eyes . I did n't want to get involved in her problems , but I could do something for her . " Maybe I can keep the dog in the hopper room in my office , " I said . " Oh , " came the breathy voice . " That would be so kind . It 's only until this evening . I 'm going to my girlfriend 's tonight . He wo n't be any bother . I promise . " She handed Pharaoh to me . He was trembling . At first I thought he was scared from the new environment and a strange pair of hands . But when I looked into his eyes I saw definite canine hatred . He was shaking with rage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go on now , honey . Mr. Rawlins 'll take care of you . " I took a step away from her and she smiled . " I do n't even know your first name , " she said . " Easy , " I said . " Call me Easy . "
