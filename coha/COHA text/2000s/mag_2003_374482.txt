Instead of a public phone , this is a public umbrella , or Street Umbrella , as they have dubbed it . A mobile phone is incorporated into the handle , and the point acts as an antenna . The umbrella protects the speaker from rain , sun or the rest of the street 's noise and activities so that he or she can have a conversation . Set into the wall behind the Street Umbrella is a screen with which users can navigate the telephone menu . The screen could also show the person the user is talking with or display images and information . <P> DESIGNER blu dot <P> A furniture-design studio started by artists and architects in Minneapolis , Minn. , in 1996 , Blu Dot is known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Concept : In a wireless world , the phone booth becomes a place that serves the basic , immutable needs humans have when they communicate : seclusion , shelter , a place to sit , listen and talk .
