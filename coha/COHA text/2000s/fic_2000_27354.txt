My father died when I was three months old . I do n't recall his laughter or his touch . My memories of him came secondhand , through my mother 's words and well-thumbed photo albums . " Your father was a soldier , " my mom told me , and there he is , in grainy black-and-white , with his GI grin and rumpled uniform , standing in the ruins of Berlin . Kids in ragged clothing cluster near him , holding high the gifts he 's taken from a tattered duffel bag-chocolate bars and chewing gum , socks and stocking caps , bits and bobs finagled from his squad . No department-store Santa ever looked half so merry as my dad did that day , among the children in the ruins of Berlin . " Your father 's favorite holiday was Christmas , " my mother said , and fully half the photos in the albums prove her point . There he is , years later , playing Santa at our church on the west side of Chicago , baking angel cookies to give to friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after another . While my father was alive , Christmas began on my mother 's birthday , the fourteenth of December , and climaxed with a lavish party on Christmas Eve . Christmas Day was spent recuperating . After my father 's death , my mother cut back on the festivities , for emotional as well as financial reasons . When I was growing up , there was always a whiff of mourning in the crisp winter air . No one had to tell me not to compare my father 's extravagant celebrations with my mother 's humbler holidays , but I secretly lived for the day when my Christmases would match those in the photographs . " The day has finally come , " I murmured . I curled my legs beneath me on the cushioned window seat and gazed upward at the sky . I was a grown woman now , with two children of my own , and the lean times I 'd endured after my mother 's death were a thing of the past . Thanks to an unexpected inheritance from a family friend , I possessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrate Christmas as lavishly as I pleased . This year , I vowed , my father 's favorite holiday would again be a time of jubilation , freed at last from any hint of sorrow . The crescent moon sailed serenely between lowering clouds , and the dead leaves on the beech hedge fluttered dryly in a bitter northeast wind . I eyed the heavy-laden clouds intently and shivered with anticipation . Christmas-my first Christmas in England and my sons ' first Christmas ever-was a mere two weeks away . I wanted it to be perfect . It was unfortunate , to be sure , that my nanny had temporarily abandoned her post to enjoy a prolonged holiday in Italy with her fianc . The twins were nine months old and fearfully mobile . It was no easy task to keep them from killing themselves and/or dismantling the cottage , but my father-in-law accepted the challenge without a second thought . William Willis , Sr. , arrived at the cottage the day after my nanny departed , and insisted on assuming her duties . Willis , Sr. , was no fair-weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mid-sixties , a Boston Brahmin and a lawyer of high repute , but his passion for fine tailoring was nothing compared to his passion for his grandsons . He slept on a rollaway bed in the nursery , got the boys up in the morning , read stories to them at night , and took dirty diapers , flying farina , and splashy baths in stride . When I commented wonderingly on his devotion , he informed me that since he 'd never expected to live long enough to see his son 's sons , he intended to make every moment with them count . With Willis , Sr. , in residence , I was able to go full speed ahead with my holiday plans . I took stock of my winter wardrobe and declared it null and void . My blue jeans and Salvation Army sweaters reminded me too strongly of the bad old days , so I dispatched the lot to Oxfam and filled my closet with silk-lined , custom-tailored trousers and tops that ran the gamut from raw silk to handspun wool to jewel-toned velvets . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suede and buttery leather , and my even rattier bathrobe with a vintage 1940s dressing gown in the softest shades of gray and baby blue . I splurged on a sumptuous black cashmere swing coat with a shawl collar I could snug around my face when the harsh winds blew . I 'd never been a clotheshorse , but I was learning fast . Once I 'd refreshed my wardrobe , I escorted my husband to Oxford to be fitted for a Father Christmas suit . While he was at the tailor 's , I hunted down exquisite antique ornaments and a lacy spun-glass star for the top of the tree . Bill and I plundered London on a dozen shopping sprees , buying gifts for everyone we knew . We roamed the bridle path in the oak grove near the cottage , harvesting evergreen boughs , bunches of holly , and sprigs of mistletoe , and brought home a living Christmas tree from a nursery near Oxford . I invited Bill 's English relatives to our Christmas Eve bash and arranged for them to spend the night at Anscombe Manor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nearest neighbor , Emma Harris . I ordered a goose , a turkey , and two hams for the party , along with sundry accompaniments , and stockpiled ingredients for the daily round of baking that would fill the cottage with holiday aromas . The decorating , the baking , the wrapping of presents , and the warbling of carols would begin tomorrow , the fourteenth of December , my late mother 's birthday . I could hardly wait . Even now , I could picture the living room , the hallway , the staircase , the entire cottage lit with candles , wreathed with evergreen garlands , and decked with boughs of holly . Best of all , I could envision my family-husband , father-in-law , and sons-gathered before the hearth , with mugs of hot cocoa and plates of angel cookies , enjoying the special peace of Christmastime . There was only one thing missing from my perfect celebration . I leaned forward to breathe upon the windowpane and wrote with a fingertip in the frosty condensation : snow . I wanted snow so badly I could taste it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lanes and transform the furrowed fields into something pristine and magical . I longed to watch my sons ' eyes widen as the cottage disappeared beneath a sparkling cascade of swirling flakes . When the heavy clouds swallowed the slender moon , I peered upward and rejoiced . My husband cleared his throat and I turned to face the living room . Bill sat in his favorite armchair , clad in a crewneck sweater and twill trousers , gazing pensively into the middle distance . Willis , Sr. , dressed down for the evening in creased pajamas , leather slippers , and a magnificent paisley dressing gown , sat in an armchair on the opposite side of the hearth , reading a novel . A fire , lit after the babies were safely tucked up in the nursery , crackled merrily and cast a rosy glow over the low-ceilinged , comfortably furnished room . I sighed with pleasure and gazed adoringly at Bill . He would make a splendid Father Christmas . If anyone had been born to play the role of a gift-giving saint , it was my gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and folded his hands over his stomach . " Christmas , " he stated flatly , " should be abolished . " " Huh ? " I said , startled . " Christmas should be abolished , " said Bill , biting off each word . " I 'm sick to death of it . " " But it has n't even started yet , " I objected . Bill blinked rapidly . " It has n't started ? Then what have we been doing for the past month ? " " Getting warmed up , " I replied . " Lori , " Bill said slowly , " do you realize that we 've been to fifteen parties in the past ten days ? " " Has it been that many ? " I said . " I guess I was n't counting . " Bill 's laughter held a touch of madness . " Seven dinner parties , five luncheons , and three sherry evenings , in addition to running back and forth from London every other day , not to mention all the little jaunts to Oxford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lori , " he gasped , " I 'm worn out . " " Of course you are . " I crossed quickly to sit on the arm of Bill 's chair , smoothed the hair back from his forehead , and cooed , " It was thoughtless of me to pile so much on you , but you know how hard it is to refuse an invitation without offending someone . I 'll go to the rest of the parties by myself , okay ? All you have to do between now and Christmas Eve is bring the tree in from the garden shed tomorrow . " Bill leaned his head against the back of the chair and breathed a sigh of relief . " I think I can manage that . " I smiled sweetly . " And play Joseph in the Nativity play . " Bill 's eyes swiveled toward my face . " Nativity play ? " I got to my feet and put a couple of yards between me and my great-hearted husband before asking , " Did n't I tell you about the Nativity play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frightening calm , " you did n't . " " Well , " I said , taking a deep breath , " Peggy Kitchen decided to stage a Nativity play on Christmas Eve , but according to her , Nativity plays are always directed by the vicar 's wife , so she corralled Lilian Bunting into directing it , only Lilian 's never directed a play before , and there was a shortage of male volunteers for the cast , so I " -I backed up another step- " I volunteered you . " Bill lowered his chin in the manner of a bull about to charge . " You 'll have to unvolunteer me , Lori . " " It 's mainly tableaux , " I coaxed . " Hardly any lines to memorize . And they 're only holding four rehearsals . " " No , " said Bill . " Not even as a favor to Lilian ? " I pleaded . " No , " Bill repeated . " Bill , " I said sternly , " it 's your civic duty to help the vicar 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pushing himself up from his chair . " You 've had civic duty on the brain ever since the Harvest Festival last summer . Well , here 's a news flash for you , Lori : I danced with the morris dancers at the festival , I singed my eyebrows lighting the Guy Fawkes Day bonfire , and I bought a year 's worth of beeswax candles for Saint George 's Church at the last benefit auction . I 've done my civic duty , and I plan to spend the next two weeks at home . " Red-faced with fury , Father Christmas stormed out of the living room , slammed open the stair gate , slammed it shut behind him , and stomped up to the master bedroom . I stood frozen in place until his last foot-thump faded , then leaned against the mantelpiece and groaned . Willis , Sr. , looked up from his novel . " My son is tired , " he offered . " Your son is right . " I sank into the chair Bill had vacated . " I never should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes but once a year , " said Willis , Sr. " It is only natural to wish to share the joys of the season with friends . " " Maybe , " I said , refusing consolation , " but I definitely could have planned our trips better . If I 'd arranged things properly , we would n't have had to run back and forth to London and Oxford so often . " " My son is accustomed to letting employees run for him , " Willis , Sr. , observed . " I do not think it such a bad thing for him to do his own running now and again . " " Okay , " I allowed , " but I should n't have volunteered him for the Nativity play without speaking with him first . " " No , " Willis , Sr. , agreed , " you should not have . " I folded my arms and slumped back . " Now Bill 's mad at me and I 've left Lilian in the lurch . " " I can do little to remedy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " but I may be able to help with the latter . " He ran a finger along his immaculately shaved jaw . " Perhaps I could take Bill 's place in the Nativity play . " I shot upright in my chair . " Are you serious ? " " I do not pretend to be a polished thespian , " Willis , Sr. , cautioned , " but I believe I could fulfill the role of Joseph without embarrassing myself or Mrs. Bunting . " " Lilian will weep with gratitude , " I assured him . " Then you may tell her not to worry about finding another Joseph , " said Willis , Sr. , with a decisive nod . He picked up his novel . " And now I believe you have some diplomatic business to conduct upstairs ? " I beamed at him . " What would I do without you , William ? " " I tremble to think , " he replied . I gave him a peck on the cheek , then headed for the staircase , hoping that Bill had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached the head of the stairs , I turned automatically toward the nursery to check on the twins and saw , in the night-light 's dim glow , that Bill had beaten me to the punch . I watched in silence as my husband bent low to place a handsome pink flannel rabbit at the foot of Rob 's crib . When he straightened , I whispered , " I 'm sorry . " " You should be , " Bill whispered back , but he put a hand out to me , to take the sting from his words . " Do n't worry about a thing , " I told him , taking his hand in mine . " From now on , we 're having a quiet Christmas at home . Except for the Christmas Eve party . " " I should be recovered by then . " Bill pulled me close and wrapped his arms around me . A few moments later he murmured softly in my ear , " Your willingness to make amends shall be rewarded , my love . " " How ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With snow , " he replied . My hands dropped to his shoulders . It was not the answer I 'd expected . Bill drew me to the window . " I do n't know if it 'll last until Christmas , but it 's a start . " A shimmering veil of snow swirled and billowed just beyond the windowpane . Fat flakes , wind-driven , splashed the glass or cartwheeled through the darkness to deepen drifts already forming along the flagstone path . It was dazzling , hypnotic , an answer to my prayers-I would have stood there all night , entranced , if my husband had n't suggested a better way to spend the evening . Hours later , long after Bill and I had fallen asleep , after Willis , Sr. , had closed his book , quenched the fire , and crept upstairs to bed , the snow kept falling . It curled like ermine along bare boughs , filled furrows in plowed fields , and drifted gently over the tattered stranger sprawled beside my graveled drive . The gift the stranger carried nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
