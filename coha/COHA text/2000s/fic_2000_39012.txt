Go ahead . Open it . I think you 'll like it . <p> I made that wrapping paper myself It 's similar to rubber , but not exactly . You kind of have to peel it off . Do you like the avocado color ? I bet you 've never seen wrapping paper that thick , huh ? <p> Oh , I forgot to tell you-if you touch it in one spot too long it will attach itself to you . Here , let me help you with that-do n't panic , now just calm down <p> Whew . Feisty stuff , huh ? You 're safe now . As long as no one touches it for the next thirty minutes or so it will die . I know it looks scary writhing about like that , but it ca n't move around on its own , so as long as we stay out of that corner we 're all right . <p> Pretty neat , huh ? I 've always wanted to give someone a box inside a box . <p> Of course not , silly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ box is n't empty . <p> Look in the corner . <p> Look closer . <p> See that strand ? <p> Yeah , the piece of spider web . Pull on it . <p> I 've been collecting webs for the past few months in the woods out back . Then last night I sewed them all into one long strand . Pretty neat , huh ? <p> Keep pulling . It 's a long strand . <p> Keep pulling . <p> Keep pulling . <p> You 'll see . Your present is at the end of the strand . <p> Keep pulling . <p> Keep pulling . <p> Keep pulling . <p> Should be sometime soon now . Pretty long strand , huh ? <p> See that door ? <p> Of course it 's a door . It 's just a very small door . See the doorknob ? Go ahead . Open it . Use your thumbnail . <p> Gee , I 'm sorry about that . I guess I should have told you the box behind the door was a big one . Here , let me help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything 's going to be all right . <p> See that velvet curtain on the side of the box ? Pull it back . There should be an elephant behind it . <p> Yes , it is a very large red elephant . You do n't see many red ones that large . We fed his mother food coloring every day from the time she conceived . Careful , now-do n't get too close to his trunk . See that gleam in his eye ? We do n't call him Mischief for nothing . <p> Yes , the elephant is on a tightrope . So are we . Do n't look down . <p> It 's not much further now , just a hundred feet or so . You can do it , do n't quit on me now , breathe ( but not too deeply ) and do n't look down <p> Good thing you can swim , huh ? I never have liked safety nets . I guess I should have told you that the tightrope was that same strand of spider web . We tested it with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and it held up fine . And of course you and I were doing fine until almost the end-there must have been a weak place in the strand . Boy , it sure is nice to stretch out on this sandbar , huh ? Most people do n't know that piranhas sleep for one hour each day . Guess we landed at a good time , huh ? <p> Yes , their eyes were open . They do n't have eyelids . I 'll have to admit I was a little nervous myself , swimming right by the school like that . <p> Monkeys . I bet you 've never heard anything like that before . So what do you think of the Amazon ? <p> See that little green fern just past your foot ? Pull it back Can you fit through there ? I know it 's tight . <p> Most people do n't even know about the root systems of these trees . There are some pretty good-sized tunnels down here , and some of them go a long ways . This one comes out in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , huh ? <p> How 's that for a view ? These mountains are really something . Smell that fresh air . Wow . <p> Oh , those are pterodactyls . This is their take-off cliff . Say , there 's our flight now . We 'd better hurry or we 'll miss him . <p> Beats the hell out of Delta , huh ? I dare say you@ve never see this sort of excitement before . A blue pterodactyl for two , soaring through the clouds . Do n't be afraid , just hold tight to me . And do n't worry about that screeching-he 's just an ornery reptile . <p> Man , what luck . It just figures that we 'd get a shrinking pterodactyl . Oh well , at least we landed in the South Pacific , where the water 's warm . <p> What about this sparkling azure water , huh ? Let 's take a divethere 's an old shipwreck over that way just a little bit . Are you good at holding your breath ? <p> Now look what you 've done . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but no , you had to have it your way , you had to pull the damn thing out of the sand . Congratulations . You 've drained the Pacific Ocean . I certainly hope you 're happy . <p> It seems to me you have yourself a sunbaked ocean bed and lots of rotting fish . That 's what it looks like to me . <p> I 'm going home . I hope you enjoyed your damn birthday . Have fun with the putrid fish . And do n't call me . <p>
