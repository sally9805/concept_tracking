So much of how we see ourselves  --  and how other people see us  --  is bound up in our faces that the idea of transplanting one person 's visage onto another seems not just improbable but bizarre . And yet for the past few years , surgeons at a handful of medical centers in the U.S. and Europe have been cautiously preparing for just such a procedure to offer hope to patients who have been severely disfigured by burns or accidents . No one had yet raised a scalpel to try , in part because of numerous medical , ethical and psychological concerns that had to be considered first . That 's one reason it was so startling to learn last week that the first face transplant  --  albeit a partial one  --  has taken place . Doctors in France reported that they took a triangular patch of facial tissue containing the nose , lips and chin of a brain-dead donor and transplanted them onto a 38-year-old mother of two who had been severely mauled by a dog last May . <P> By all accounts , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets of public-health and ethics authorities , was a success . The match and color of the transplanted section " were even better than we had expected , " said Dr. Bernard Devauchelle , coordinator of one of the surgical teams . " In just four hours we had re-established vascular connections between the skin fragment and the patient . " <P> Surgery is , however , just the beginning of the woman 's medical odyssey . She must take powerful drugs for the rest of her life to ensure that her immune system does not reject the graft . Of all the tissues in the body , the skin provokes a particularly strong rejection response , which makes sense when you consider that one of its functions is to act as a barrier against germs . The weakened immune system that results from the drugs also increases the risk of cancer . <P> The doctors hope to further reduce the danger of rejection by injecting the patient with stem cells taken from the bone marrow of the original donor . That is an experimental approach in which the donated stem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immune system to tolerate the graft . <P> The facial transplant , which would have been unusual under any circumstances , stirred heated debate following a French media report that the woman might have sustained her injuries during a suicide attempt in which the dog apparently bit her in an effort to wake her up . That raised the question of whether she was stable enough psychologically to give consent to the operation , never mind care for herself afterward . But Dr. Jean-Michel Dubernard , one of the surgeons who operated on the woman , denied the report . " There was no suicide attempt , " he told reporters . Instead , he said , the woman took a sleeping pill after a family fight , and the dog bit her when she stepped on it in the night . She was examined by several psychiatrists , he added , who determined that she was a suitable candidate for transplant . <P> Others criticized the operation as a rush to make history . " I believe a better result could have been achieved with careful facial reconstruction , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Academy of Medicine . " This procedure was based on ambition . " <P> Dubernard would have none of it . " For us , it was not a matter of being first , " he told TIME . " It just happened that we had a good candidate and a good donor and an excellent team .
