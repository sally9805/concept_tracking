<p> Burned by the dot-coms and other failed ventures , private investors are now turning to an unexpected place to make money  --  college students . <p> My Rich Uncle , a New York company , is offering human capital as an investment , setting up mutual funds of sorts for investors willing to provide students with funding for college in exchange for a percentage of future earnings . <p> " The return on a college education is almost twice that of an equity investment , " said Vishal Garg , co-founder of My Rich Uncle . " One out of 10 companies may succeed . Here , we are investing in high-quality undergraduate and graduate students , most of whom will succeed . " <p> Garg said there is a " sizable need " for such alternative financing as students face rising tuition and other costs and a loss in family savings from a falling stock market . But critics say there is something unseemly about individuals capitalizing on student need . One called it tantamount to " indentured servitude . " <p> The human capital contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposed by Nobel Prize-winning economist Milton Friedman , wrote Miguel Palacios in a recent report presented at a conference hosted by the conservative Cato Institute . But , Palacios said , the introduction of subsidized federal loans killed the system before it got off the ground . <p> But Garg and co-founder Raza Kahn breathed new life into the concept in 2001 with My Rich Uncle , and they have investors and supporters . <p> " Education is an investment . People who get a college education make more than those who do n't . There ought to be a way to invest capital in it , " said David Salisbury , director of the Center for Educational Freedom at the Cato Institute . " College costs are increasing , and this is a way for students to be able to obtain a college education that they would n't otherwise . " <p> Garg wo n't disclose the number of students who have signed up , he said , for proprietary reasons , but the company provides funding for students at more than 100 colleges and universities across the country . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and payment rates range from 1 to 4 percent of future earnings on every $10,000 invested . The students also pay My Rich Uncle a one-time fee of 2.5 percent that is automatically deducted from the financial assistance . <p> After graduation , instead of having a fixed amount to pay back , they pay a fixed percentage of their earnings every year for a predetermined time period . Garg said that gives graduates the flexibility to pursue their career goals without worrying that if they fail , they wo n't be able make payments . <p> " It allows them to go after the job they want , rather than the job they need to get , " he said . <p> PAYBACK COULD BALLOON <p> But students could easily end up paying back up to four times as much as they borrowed , said Terry Hartle , senior vice president for the American Council on Education , an umbrella group for colleges and universities . <p> " The people who are providing the investment money ( for My Rich Uncle ) are in it to make money . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have the students ' best interest at heart , " he said . <p> " Most colleges and universities will have arrangements with financial institutions that offer good terms , " Hartle said . Students should go to their college financial aid office first for help , he said . <p> Yoon Park , 20 , a sophomore at the University of California at San Diego , said she is attracted to the program over loans because of the payback terms . <p> " I would n't have to pay hefty interest , but pay according to my income . I do n't have to worry about it when I 'm in school , " said Park , a computer engineering major . " I do n't want to depend on my parents too much when they are having a hard time . " <p> Park has been approved for $1,400 , which she will repay at a rate of 0.4 percent of her salary for 10 to 15 years , depending on whether she goes to graduate school . Computer engineers in California make an average starting salary of about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> If Park were to earn just the average starting salary , she would end up paying My Rich Uncle about $2,240 over 10 years . That amount would rise considerably if Park 's salary rises . If she had gotten a Stafford loan , a commonly used federally subsidized loan program with an interest rate of 4.06 percent , the same loan would have cost her $1,968 over the same period  --  though , interest rates on Stafford loans are subject to change . <p> " It is not immoral , it is not illegal . But it is not necessarily a good option for borrowers , " Hartle said . <p> My Rich Uncle officials say their system provides students with the funding to fill the gap between costs and what they get from their families and government loans and grants . <p> While loans put the risk on taxpayers , the human capital system shifts that risk to investors and gives them the opportunity to benefit , co-founder Kahn said . <p> It has n't yet been tested in court , but students ca n't easily weasel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deferred if a student joins the Peace Corps or another volunteer organization , and a medical student , for example , who gets married and decides to stay home with the kids after becoming a doctor will still have to pay . The payments would be calculated based on any income the individual receives or one-half of the family 's combined gross income . My Rich Uncle receives a percentage of whichever is greater . <p> The system is completely merit-based , and eligibility and terms are determined based on an investment evaluation of an applicant 's school , year , field of study , grades and career plans , Garg said . <p> The company does target middle-class students attending good schools who will likely get well-paying jobs . It favors graduate students in business , law , medicine and engineering and undergraduates in majors such as finance and economics . <p> About 60 percent of the students who have signed up are in graduate school , and about 40 percent are undergraduates . <p> Sandra Baum , an economist at Skidmore College and expert on college affordability who sees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most part wo n't benefit students who most need the help . <p> The company uses standardized tests such as the SAT to estimate a person 's future earnings , Baum said , so minorities would be more likely to pay a higher percentage  --  or be denied . <p> " It is quite clear that people whose future earnings are likely to be less will be denied or will be paying a higher percentage of their income . That is really not helping for access , " she said . <p> But one program run by My Rich Uncle is more altruistic . <p> The program at UC San Diego , from which Park received her loan , was funded by alumnus Michael Robertson and is n't limited to students in the traditional money-making fields . <p> Robertson , 35 , and a 1990 graduate , made a fortune selling his company MP3.com and invested $3 million through My Rich Uncle to provide education assistance . <p> The money that students pay back through their earnings after graduation is put back into the fund to help future students . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here is to prove out a model where there are mutual funds investing in education . We have a real opportunity to change the way people are funding education , " Robertson said . <p> Jim Langley , vice chancellor of external relations at UC San Diego , said that the program adds to the financial aid possibilities for students . <p> " It is tight . If you are a young university like we are , we have a great unmet need . We have far more deserving students than we can help , " he said . <p> But Baum said the only reason she sees for a student to turn to private investment is if the student knows something My Rich Uncle does n't know . <p> " If you think you are going to be a public interest lawyer , " she said , " and you can do this without telling them , then it might make sense .
