Cash-strapped consumers are getting reacquainted with cooking at home , and that 's been bad news for restaurants and their stocks . <p> The dining-out industry is suffering through a major fire in the kitchen . Slowing business is forcing chains to shutter locations . Restaurants that remain open are seeing a drop-off in sales . <p> Shares of the top 26 restaurant companies have seen their stocks lose an average 49.3% of their value from their highest points over the past 52 weeks . That 's been an even harsher pullback than the 46.5% decline of the Standard &amp; Poor 's 500 from its 52-week high . <p> There 's even deeper pain suffered by individual restaurants and their investors . Ruth 's Hospitality , operator of the Ruth 's Chris Steak Houses ; DineEquity , which runs IHOP and Appleby 's ; and Ruby Tuesday have all seen their stocks fall nearly 90% . <p> Meanwhile , 20 members of the retail and restaurants industry classification are dangerously close to having trouble keeping up with the interest payments on their corporate debt , S&amp;P says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that S&amp;P considers the weakest . Meanwhile , nine of the top 26 publicly traded companies have posted losses in their most recent quarters . <p> " Everyone is pulling back , " says Lynne Collier , restaurant analyst at KeyBanc . " The economy is playing into it . " <p> While the economy is prompting some families to closely review their budgets , taking a hard look at their dining-out costs , the stock market is especially punishing restaurants that : <p> *Cater to the high-end diner . As consumers look to cut back expenses , restaurants with the highest tabs are the first to see business slide , says Jeff Farmer , analyst at Jefferies . Consumers might forgo brunches at Cheesecake Factory if they 're worried about their jobs , he says . <p> Many of the higher-end restaurants are also hurt by the fact that companies are trimming their expense account spending , says Ronald Shaich , CEO of Panera Bread . <p> Diners are migrating to the lower-price menus such as Buffalo Wild Wings , where customers can enjoy beer , chicken wings and televised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 52-week high , they have risen 22% this year even as the S&amp;P 500 has fallen 15% . <p> The company 's sales at stores open at least a year grew 4.5% in the fourth quarter , and earnings rose 28.7% to $7.7 million . <p> Similarly , with its relatively low-price menu , McDonald 's has been an industry bright spot . While other restaurants are seeing business slow , sales rose 5.4% in January at McDonald 's locations open at least a year . The industry leader 's shares are beating the broader market this year , down 12% . <p> *Have considerable debt loads . Many of the larger players in the industry were borrowing heavily when business was booming three years ago , Collier says . The use of debt allowed the companies to boost their shareholder returns , she says . Many restaurants also used borrowed money to buy back shares of their stock . <p> The industry 's debt burden has become onerous . As a group , restaurants have borrowed 83 cents for every $1 in shareholders equity , Thomson Reuters says . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ S&amp;P 500 on average have borrowed 76 cents for every $1 in shareholders equity . <p> But several restaurants have debt loads that are almost twice the industry 's lofty level . <p> These heavy debt loads have come back to burn many of the restaurant companies . And investors , already worried about the difficultly companies may have in refinancing their debt , have sold the stocks . " These companies did n't need to be leveraged up , " Collier says . " The timing was very unfortunate . " <p> *Rely on dinner . Restaurants that get a big slice of their business and profit in the evenings are feeling the downturn most , Shaich says . That 's been a big reason behind troubles at many of the large casual-dining chains , he says . <p> At Panera , for instance , breakfast traffic has been the least affected , followed by lunch . Workers are still paying to take themselves out to lunch . " Not buying a Lexus is one thing , but to brown bag it , that 's a lower savings , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question is , when will the restaurants do better and the stocks turn around ? <p> With little clarity of when the economy will heal , restaurant stocks by and large continue to sink , Collier says . <p> Despite the bruising the stocks have taken , valuations as a group are n't cheap compared with the market . The restaurant industry is trading for 16 times its earnings over the past 12 months excluding restructuring charges , Thomson Reuters says . <p> That 's down from its high valuation mark of 38 times earnings but still above the S&amp;P 500 's 13.2 P-E , or price-earnings ratio , measured on a similar basis . <p> Collier does n't expect the restaurant industry 's turnaround to come for at least 12 months and possibly up to 24 months . <p> Still , as soon as consumers feel more confident that they 'll hang onto their jobs , they will quickly resume dining out , Collier says . <p> Shares of several restaurant stocks have been faring much better in 2009 . <p> Shares of O'Charley 's , Steak n Shake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 11% , respectively , largely because of the fact they had already been beaten down . <p> " It 's hard to go back and cook at home every night , " Collier says . " People want to go out and reward themselves . That will happen eventually .
