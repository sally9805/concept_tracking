<p> The Final Four and its power teams come later . Now it 's the little big men who lace up high-top glass slippers , yearning to spin a basketball game into a fairy tale . <p> They are , in some cases , exotically nicknamed stars from schools better known if their names ended before the hyphen . <p> This is their time , the first round of the NCAA tournament , belonging as much to Davidson as to Duke . <p> " A lot of guys at the big schools might take the tournament for granted , " Davidson guard Brendan Winters says . " But for the midmajors and smaller , this is the biggest deal around . This puts us in the same sentence with the elite teams . " <p> Davidson is David . Ohio State is Goliath . They meet Friday . Such games are what the first round is all about . <p> " I 'm a midmajor guy , and it becomes a part of you when you 've been living it for four years , " Winters says . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creep up on the big guys . " <p> Montana forward Jordan Hasquet agrees . " There 's no pressure on us . The pressure is on the teams that are supposed to beat us . We get to go out and ... give somebody a run for their money . " <p> Here are five little big men who will try to do just that : <p> ' Squeaky ' Johnson <p> University of Alabama at Birmingham <p> No player in this year 's tournament can offer the combination of hairstyle , nickname and life experience that Carldell " Squeaky " Johnson will bring when he lines up at point guard for UAB . <p> His flowing , braided locks are a style popular in his native New Orleans and , indirectly , account for his nickname . Johnson 's curly hair reminded his mother , Elise , of the character Squiggy on Laverne &; Shirley . That morphed over time into Squeaky . <p> The path Johnson followed to Birmingham was n't straight and was rarely easy . His father , Lonnie , died in 2000 after a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson to junior college before coach Mike Anderson gave him a chance at UAB . Johnson had to earn that chance , raising his grades while working a full-time job with the university groundskeeping crew . That led to a scholarship three years ago . <p> In August , his mother 's home in New Orleans was obliterated by Hurricane Katrina . Johnson did not know the fate of his family for five days ; he then learned they had been evacuated to Houston . <p> Now they live in Birmingham , and his mother is able to see her son play regularly for the first time . She will travel to Philadelphia to see the Blazers play Kentucky , a team they upset in the 2004 tournament when Kentucky was a top seed . <p> " We lost everything in the hurricane , " Johnson says . " But it 's been a blessing to have my mother here . I 've been able to show her I could lead our family . " <p> Just as he has led his team to three consecutive NCAA tournament berths . Johnson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Division I in assists-to-turnovers ratio ( better than 3.2-to-1 ) and is shooting 50% from three-point range . <p> " It 's been a funny road , " he says . " There were times when I just worried about making ends meet . I never had anything given to me . But I think I appreciate life more because of that . " <p> Boo Davis <p> Wisconsin-Milwaukee <p> Wisconsin-Milwaukee was one of the more engaging stories of last year 's tournament , storming out of the Horizon League as a 12 seed to upset Alabama and Boston College before falling to No.1 Illinois . After losing coach Bruce Pearl to Tennessee and leading scorer Ed McCants , new coach Rob Jeter knew someone had to step up for the team to reach the NCAAs again . <p> The man Jeter tapped was Ronald " Boo " Davis , who responded by scoring 16.2 points a game , six more than last season . He also led the team in steals and foul shooting . <p> " McCants and ( then-senior forward Joah ) Tucker were so dominant last year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeter says . " It was obvious we needed to run some offense through him and get him in a rhythm . " <p> That was welcome news to Davis , who has taken 58 more three-point shots than last year and hit 29 more ( 85-for-220 ) . <p> " I showed some flashes last year , but I was a little overshadowed , " says Davis , who was given his nickname as a boy by his cousin . " I told Coach Jeter I needed to shoot . " <p> Davis is a whirling dervish on defense , routinely drawing the opposition 's top perimeter scorer . " He is so doggone aggressive that sometimes I have to rein him back a little " on the defensive end , Jeter says . " But he is our lockdown defender , no question . " <p> Jeter says Milwaukee 's chances against Oklahoma rest largely on Davis : " In the tournament , teams that can shoot the ball well , especially the midmajors , have a chance to pull an upset , and Boo is going to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no wonder Brendan Winters has perfect form on his pretty jump shot . I taught him how to shoot , says his father , Brian , who was known for his picture-perfect release at South Carolina in the 1970s and for nine NBA seasons . Winters scored a career-high 33 points against Chattanooga in the Southern Conference tournament final , then went into the stands to find his father , coach of the WNBA Indiana Fever . We hugged , and I told him how proud I was , his dad says . Winters , at 6-5 and with his fathers high release , shoots over defenders . He hit six three-point shots in the Chattanooga game and was tournament MVP . Last season he was conference player of the year . Brendan will be making money somewhere next year , Davidson coach Bob McKillop says . Maybe in the NBA , if he finds the perfect situation , or maybe overseas . Davidson was his perfect situation for college . Winters says he would have accepted a scholarship from any Division I school in the country after his senior year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came . His father called McKillop . They had played basketball against each other in high school and on the playgrounds of New Yorks Rockaway Beach . McKillop suggested a year at prep school . Brendan needed to grow into his body and add some athleticism and strength , McKillop says . He was a typical Irish kid . They mature a little later . But I knew , based on his work ethic and his basketball IQ , he was going to get better every year . Winters says comparisons with this father used to get old , but no longer . He wears No. 32 , his fathers number . My name always gets paired with his , Winters says . Everyone always tells me my shot looks like his . Thats because he taught me how to shoot . And Im definitely thankful for that . <p> John Goldsberry North Carolina-Wilmington John Goldsberry looks like a pretty boy . He does nt play like one . John is as tough as any player in America , says Brad Brownell , his coach at North Carolina-Wilmington . He dives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chin . He has a scar on his forehead . I tell him the longer the season goes , the uglier he gets . Lindsay Gleason , his girlfriend , begs to differ . It does nt matter how many scars he gets , she says . He s still the best-looking one out there . When Goldsberry was a freshman , he hit eight of eight threepointers in his only NCAA tournament game , a heartbreaking 75-73 loss to Maryland . It remains the record for three pointers in an NCAA tournament game without a miss . In the Colonial Athletic Association tournament semifinals and finals , he scored a total of 12 points but had 20 assists to three turnovers . Goldsberry learned the game from his father , Frank , director of womens basketball operations for the University of Dayton . Before that , his father coached high school boys basketball for 17 years and girls for 10 . Notre Dame All-America guard Megan Duffy played for him , as did two daughters . Thursday , Goldsberrys father will be in Greensboro , N.C. , to see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hell watch them play Saturday , most likely against Duke . Sunday he will be at Purdue to watch his daughter , Lindsey , play for Bowling Green against UCLA in the NCAA womens tournament . Hell miss his son Robert play for Tippecanoe in Thursdays regional semifinals of the Ohio state high school tournament . Lindseys team is 28-2 , Johns is 25-7 and Roberts is 24-0 , the old coach says . Its been a good year . John Goldsberry carries the same name as his late grandfather , who played defensive tackle for the NFL Chicago Cardinals in 1949 and 50 . Goldsberry was a defensive back in high school . Ive always thought of myself as a football player playing basketball , he says . He plays like one even in practice . Well play five on none and the ball will be going out of bounds , and hell dive to save it , Brownell says . Thats just the way he is . " <p> Jordan Hasquet Montana Jordan Hasquet ( rhymes with basket ) is a legacy in Montana basketball : uHeman Bird @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago for a traveling team from Red Wing , Minn. uRobert Hasquet , his grandfather , played for Montana from 1949-51. uDoris Deden , his mother , played for Montana from 1980-84 and is seventh in career scoring ( 1,248 points ) . Her sister , Linda , is 14th in career rebounding ( 626 from 1976-80 ) . Jordan has roots to Montana basketball that go back 100 years on his mothers side and more than 50 years on my side , says his father , Pete , who played junior varsity basketball there . We love the Grizzlies in this house . Hasquet is 6-9 . His father says credit for that goes to Hasquets mother , who is 6-1 , and to her family . When I go to church , Im the shortest one in the pew , and the other four are women , Hasquets father says . Hasquets mothers team beat Oregon State in the first round of the 1984 NCAA womens tournament and lost to eventual champion Southern California and Cheryl Miller in the second round . Coach Larry Krystkowiak has known Hasquet since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he spent five summers living in the Hasquets basement near campus in Missoula . We always got some sweet shoes at Christmas , says Hasquet , who lives in that basement now , the teams only player who lives at home . Hasquet was recruited to Montana before Krystkowiak became coach two years ago . They arrived on campus around the same time , and Hasquet redshirted last season so he could put on weight . In the conference tournament final against Northern Arizona , an off-balance Hasquet tipped in a missed shot in spectacular fashion . I looked at my coaches and said , He s been doing that in his backyard since he was 3 , Krystkowiak says .
