<p> EDINBURG , Texas - Abe Lemons was unique . He could have gotten rich as a stand-up comedian . Instead he coached university basketball teams that won 599 games . <p> His real name was n't Abe . <p> " They christened me just plain A.E . Lemons , " he said . " When I went in the service they made me pick a name , so I put a ' B ' in the middle and was Abe . Later I thought I could have named myself ' Ace , ' but that would have made me a different person . " <p> Lemons was a tough , 6-foot-4 fighter out of Walters , Okla . He stood about as tall as Abe Lincoln , and shared that Abe 's love for jokes . <p> He cost himself his 600th victory . Most coaches would kill to reach that milestone . <p> " We had a great shooter named Jim Krivacs at The University of Texas , " said Jim Lancaster , Abe 's student athletic trainer for the Longhorns . " Krivacs was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State , the game started with a technical foul . The home team had dunked the ball in practice , which was illegal . <p> " Abe did n't like that rule ; he thought it was silly . So he told Krivacs to shoot the free throw with his back to the basket . Krivacs used to do that in practice , for fun , and made some of them . So Krivacs bore down , and the free throw hit the rim , but barely missed . <p> " And the Longhorns lost that game by one point , and Abe ended his career one win short of 600 . But Abe laughed about it , " Lancaster said . <p> Some colleges offered to hire Abe as coach for one last game to get his 600th win , but he said , " No , I 'd rather be remembered as the coach who cost himself 600 wins . " <p> Always a free spirit , Lemons liked jokes and oddities . <p> " The first year I was his trainer on the road , I was working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now the head athletic trainer for the University of Texas-Pan American . Abe recommended him for the Pan Am job around 1980 . UTPA was named Pan American University when Abe coached there , winning 55 games , losing 16 . <p> " So I 'd hobble onto the court to help somebody , " Lancaster said , " and Lemons would tell people , ' My trainer is hurt worse than any of my players , and he does HIS job ! ' Lancaster carries everything we need on the road , or he can find it for me . If I told him , ' Get me a machine gun , Lancaster ! , ' he would say , ' With or without dum-dum bullets , coach ? " ' <p> Lemons had war experience . In the three years I was his sports information director at Pan American University , 1973-76 , Lemons joked about just about every subject possible , except his mother and World War II . <p> He was part of the Greatest Generation , those veterans who came home after looking death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't take life too seriously . They had seen worse . <p> Over three years I pried Lemons ' war record out of him , slowly . He did n't like to talk about it . He served four years in the U.S. Merchant Marine , a seaman who delivered the supplies that won the war . <p> " Where did you go in the war , coach ? " I asked him <p> " In four years I sailed every big port that was open except Murmansk , Russia . " <p> Why did n't you go to Murmansk ? <p> " Because everyone who went to Murmansk got killed . " <p> I thought he was exaggerating for comic effect , but he was n't smiling . <p> Later I learned that one big convoy had every ship sunk by German U-boats and bombers before the ships could reach Murmansk . <p> Pestering him for details , I got him to admit this much : " It was slow , it was dull . The convoys would go about 11 knots ( 10 mph ) . The calm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fire torpedoes straight in heavy seas . You 'd be sailing along on a smooth sea and all of a sudden a ship would blow up . We did n't stop to pick up survivors . We sailed right past them . We had a Navy ship at the back of the convoy to pick up survivors . " <p> Some 30,000 Allied merchant seamen were killed in the North Atlantic by German submarines . Abe experienced things that made him happy to be a coach , become a comedian . <p> He could be a sharp-tongued taskmaster , like a young officer bawling out a common seaman to lower the lifeboats faster . <p> " Congratulations , Hart ! You got one more rebound than a dead man , the first half ! " Abe liked to use that comparison . Hart had got 18 points , 18 rebounds , the previous game . <p> " Thanks , coach ! " Hart said , taking it as a compliment . Abe benched him as a starter after that . <p> After one great season at Pan American - " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the road in five different states - I watched a team meeting before the Broncs made a big trip to Las Vegas to play UNLV . <p> " Does anybody have any questions ? " Abe asked , which he rarely did . He usually barked orders instead . <p> One Bronc said , " Yes , coach why is nobody ever guarding me , on defense ? ' " ' <p> Abe could n't believe it . <p> " The season is almost over , and you do n't know that YOU are supposed to be guarding THEM on defense ? " He left that player home from Las Vegas . A terrible punishment . The survivors played defense . <p> Lemon teased mercilessly , as merchant seamen did for amusement . Once he told me , " That new suit of yours looks like a TV test-pattern ! " <p> It still hangs , a 1970s checkered relic , in my closet , barely worn . Lemons dressed sharp . <p> Once , in Amarillo , the Broncs had just four men score all their points , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ radio show I asked Abe , " What did you think of Chuy Guerra 's performance tonight , coach ? 20 points , 15 assists , seven rebounds , one turnover , and he played all 45 minutes ! " <p> " Little Jesus played turrible tonight , " Lemons growled in that Oklahoma twang he never lost . <p> " How 's that , coach ? " I said , shocked at his attitude and the fact he called Pan Am 's all-time great playmaker guard " Little Jesus " on the radio . <p> " He should n't have made that one turnover ! " Abe growled , but his eyes twinkled . <p> Abe liked to irritate people to see how they would react . Once he insulted me at breakfast in Beaumont , after the Broncs had ended a Lamar home-court winning streak . <p> " If you were n't my boss , Abe , I 'd ask you to step outside and fight ! " I said , unwisely , in anger . <p> " OK , McKone , for five minutes I 'm not your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were taking off our sports coats outside the nice restaurant , and I was thinking , " Oh my God , he 's 10 years older , but he has fought in ports and on ships and he has a big reach and if I fight him inside he 'll break my ribs , and I fight him outside he 'll break my nose . " <p> I decided to fight him outside ; my nose already had been broken three times . <p> " But , oh God , what if the papers pick this up ? They will say ' Coach Beats Up Sports Writer , ' or maybe ' Sports Writer Beats Up Coach , ' and either way , I lose ! " <p> Then Bill White , the assistant coach Lemons called " Blanco Bill , " said " You do n't really want to fight , do you ? " and I was the one who said no , so we went back inside and finished breakfast . <p> We calmly discussed the road victory . <p> " Little Jesus was the only player on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation was , and what to do in the last two minutes , and he did it , " Lemons said . <p> It was a good quote . I wrote it down . Lemons smiled at me . <p> Lemons ' sharp wit caused my wife Jerry to embroider a sampler that said , " When Life Gives You Lemons , Make Lemonade . " It hung behind my desk , in the office next to Abe 's , for three years . He never commented on it . He would glance at it sometimes . <p> A.E . Lemons was a low-income guy who grew up in the Great Depression in Oklahoma . He took his unlikely life and made lemonade out of it . <p> He died at age 79 , on Sept. 2 , back in the city where he began and ended his coaching career at Oklahoma City University . <p> If I had my life to live over , I might have gone ahead and fought Abe with bare knuckles that morning in Beaumont , just for the honor of having been knocked out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
