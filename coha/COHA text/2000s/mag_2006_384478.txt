. How to resolve your differences  --  even in front of the kids . My husband , Jason , and I linger at the dinner table , trying to ignore the fight brewing over Yu-Gi-Oh ! cards in the next room . Eli , 8 , has " borrowed " his older brother Milo 's prized Exodia Necros card , and Milo wants it back . When polite requests fail , Milo , 10 , resorts to arm-twisting  --  literally . Eli howls . " Milo , to your room , now ! " Jason bellows as he stomps into the family room . " Wait , ca n't we first have Eli recognize that this would n't have happened if he 'd just given the card back ? " I ask , chasing after him . " We can do it after the time-out , " says Jason . " But the teachable moment is now , " I insist . " The teachable moment is going to have to wait till after the time-out , " he says . Look who 's fighting now  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents should present a united front when it comes to discipline . But , as many couples know , this is n't always how things go . Many discuss , debate , and just plain argue about discipline , which is okay . When you disagree about something , each of you has a chance to air your attitudes and approaches , which helps you hear each other 's viewpoints more fully . More important , " it can lead to a better , more thoughtful resolution , " says Anthony Wolf , Ph.D. , author of " Mom , Jason 's Breathing on Me ! " In other words , disagreements about what to do when the kids misbehave can lead to well-considered rules and consequences for breaking them that seem fair to everyone . But not every childhood crime will have an agreed-upon punishment in place at the time it 's committed . That 's when the grown-ups may find themselves publicly at odds , and that 's not necessarily bad , provided you do it properly ( more on that in a minute ) . " Your child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be listened to , " says Michele Borba , author of 12 Simple Secrets Real Moms Know . " Beyond that , she can learn the art of negotiation , compromise , and peacemaking . " So , your child can actually glean these lessons from seeing her parents face off ; you just need to follow some ground rules . ( But keep in mind that a child under 3 wo n't be able to take away anything positive from watching Mommy and Daddy bicker . With a little kid , you should take it outside  --  or at least into the next room . If that 's not possible , just stow it until later when she 's asleep . ) GROUND RULE : Agree to hear each other out in front of the kids . Much as you may believe that you 're absolutely , positively right ( and your spouse has lost all perspective ) , it 's important that you both get to present your opinions fully . No interrupting with cries of " You are so wrong ! " allowed . Adhering to basic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Connecticut , home of Barrie Dolnick , mom of Elisabeth , 6  --  especially when it comes to television watching . " My husband , Gary , and I disagree strongly about it . I grew up watching it , and I think there 's nothing wrong with it . But he 's a neuroscientist and ca n't stand the idea of Elisabeth watching more than a drop of PBS , " she says . So when Barrie rewards Elisabeth with TV , Gary inevitably steps up with his viewpoint : " Basically , I make the case that TV is garbage , and reading is so much better for you , " he says . Barrie then states her side of the issue , and from there they work out how much Elisabeth can watch . " We 've agreed not to let the debate get heated , though , " says Barrie . " And I actually like that we discuss this in front of her . It helps make her a critical thinker ; she knows that people can have strongly opposing views and still get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dad does n't want me to watch TV . He says books are better for the brain . How about yours ? ' ' " GROUND RULE : Develop tiebreaker tactics for when you get seriously deadlocked . One good strategy : Find ways to make each parent a primary decision maker , part of the time . " My husband is a total soft touch , " says Janis Mysona of San Francisco , mom of Hannah , 13 , and Abby , 10 . " He works long hours , and when he comes home , all the rules tend to go right out the window . It would be way past Abby 's bedtime and I 'd find David and her cuddled up in the family room , watching TV . I 'd have to break up the lovefest and order her off to bed . David would jump in with " But I 've barely seen her all week , and we 're having such a good time ... ' ' " After months of battles , during which Janis felt like the household killjoy , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control . They decided that , by and large , Janis would call the shots on weekdays , and David would rule the roost on the weekends . " He 's got a long wick , and that 's fine on the week-ends . I 'm the disciplinarian , and that 's what 's needed on weeknights . Now that we 've agreed who 's calling the shots when , we pretty much know where things are heading and do n't get into big blowouts over " Yes , she can stay up another twenty minutes , ' or " No , she ca n't . ' ' " Other ways to deal with stalemates : Agree to let the parent who feels most passionately about the issue at hand have the last word . Or defer to the parent who swooped in on the touchy situation first . But make sure each of you has some victories under your respective belts . If one parent always wins or dominates , the system is n't serving you well . GROUND RULE : Know how to shut things down if tempers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the best punishment for Play-Doh jammed into the DVD player to devolve into a screaming match . But sooner or later there will probably be a discipline " debate " that threatens to spin out of control in front of your child . And if that happens , not only are you giving your child an education in how to lose it , you also run the risk of having her think she 's to blame . It 's time to take it down a notch when your voices get an edge to them , you start making derogatory comments , it 's clear things are about to escalate , or your child 's getting upset . Three parent-tested tactics for when it 's best to hash it out in private : * Use a code word . " One of us will say " pas devant , " which is French for " not in front of ... , ' ' " says Dolnick . " Then we tell Elisabeth , " Mom and Dad need to discuss this in private , and we 'll get back to you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hairy eyeball . " When Dave starts telling me to lighten up , I give him The Look  --  okay , you might call it a glare , " says Mysona . " He knows it means , " You know where we stand on this ; it 's not up for debate . ' ' " * Walk away . " When I do n't want to lose it , I go into the yard or the bathroom , where I break the tension . Nothing gets resolved until I come back and am ready to talk it through , " says Mercy Eelman , a mom of two , in Westfield , New Jersey . Will this hashing-it-out discipline style work for you ? Much will depend on the kind of partners you are . The night of the Yu-Gi-Oh ! card-snatching incident , a big part of me wished our family had ironclad house rules . But instead , we debated the situation for a few minutes , and I somewhat reluctantly let my husband decide the consequences . ( His winning foray ? " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reinforce that bickering over cards is a fantastic way for our family to spend the evening . " ) Our discipline style pretty much reflects who we are as a couple and a family : two very different people who know that , with a little negotiation and just a touch of sarcasm , we can work out just about anything . And there 's nothing wrong with our kids seeing that . 5 times you must be united There should be no last-minute finagling in matters of : 1 . SAFETY . Never waver when it comes to things like standing on the glass-top coffee table , scootering in the street , or whacking a little brother over the head . 2 . RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY FIGURES ( parents , grandparents , teachers , etc . ) . Rudeness targeted at adults is unacceptable . 3 . HEALTH . Do n't even think about debating whether or not a child has to brush her teeth , finish all her icky-tasting medicine , or wear sunscreen at the park . 4 . EDUCATION . As soon as your kid is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting homework done , period . 5 . LYING . It should n't be tolerated under any circumstances : It 's that serious a trust issue .
