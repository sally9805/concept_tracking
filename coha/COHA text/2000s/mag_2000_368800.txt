I 'm in the middle of writing a book and have been conducting a lot of interviews . A few weeks ago , I decided to get efficient and hire a friend of a friend who lives in Chicago to transcribe the tapes that have been piling up . With a few e-mails , we quickly agreed on a price and a work schedule . In his last e-mail , my new assistant had a novel request . Would I mind paying him through PayPal ? <P> It was the second time in a week I had been steered to PayPal . A few days earlier , I won an auction on eBay , and the seller 's listing said he accepted payment through PayPal and Billpoint . I knew these were the two leaders in the online-payment field , with millions of registered users between them , but I had never used either one . I decided to give PayPal a try . <P> My usual bill-paying routine leaves  --  let 's face it  --  room for improvement . I start by writing a check , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I riffle through desk drawers looking for an envelope . Then I hunt for a stamp with the proper first-class postage . ( Jeez ! Hard to believe that dog-eared 29cents stamp has n't been good for nine years . ) And then , like everyone else , I wait for the U.S. Postal Service to brave snow , rain , heat and gloom of night to deliver my letter  --  days later . <P> Things were a lot different with PayPal . I went to its website
