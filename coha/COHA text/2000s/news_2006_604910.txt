<p> PLANTATION , Fla.  --  April29 ca n't get here fast enough for Vince Young . That 's when the University of Texas quarterback will officially meet his future by being selected in the first round of the NFL draft . <p> Unofficially , projections for how long a Saturday that will be for Young are all over the board . It is a long shot that Young will be chosen No.1 overall by his hometown Houston Texans , who are leaning toward Southern California running back Reggie Bush . He might be destined to be picked third by the Tennessee Titans . Or go to the Oakland Raiders in the seventh slot . <p> Young , 22 , is the Great Debate of this month 's NFL draft . <p> He is an electric talent with megastar potential and has been impressive in recent workouts . Yet he has been the subject of enough questions that some analysts are hesitant to label him a can't-miss prospect . <p> In some mock drafts , Young is projected as the No.3 quarterback  --  after Southern California 's Matt Leinart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10th to the Arizona Cardinals or 13th to the Baltimore Ravens . <p> " You hear so much ; it 's something different every day , " Young says in the midst of a whirlwind NFL tour that had him visiting the Miami Dolphins , picking 16th . " I do n't feed into it a lot . You never know what 's going to happen . " <p> Of course , Young does n't expect to be sitting in the backstage green room when the 16th pick comes around . <p> " Hey , " he says , " Miami might trade up and snatch me up quick . " <p> When the scenario is put to Dolphins coach Nick Saban , he acknowledges considering all options . <p> " I can call Bill Cowher and tell him what we 're going to run on third down , " Saban grumbles , referring to the Pittsburgh Steelers coach and opponent in the Sept.7 regular-season opener . " You kind of do n't want your game plan to be out of the bag . It 's not an advantage for anybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Saban , though , hardly conceals his respect for Young , whom he has known since Young attended his football camp at LSU as a teenager . Saban lights up when talking about Young 's " competitive character . " <p> As for buzz about Young 's stock teetering , Saban says , " I would recommend that anybody who does think that just watch him play in that championship game , and they 'd forget about it quick . " <p> Agent Major Adams bristles at the thought Young , 30-2 as a starter at Texas , is anything lower than a top-five pick . He thinks Young 's workouts , character and history of rising to challenges supersede any doubts . " I know this from talking to the coaches and scouts , not from the newspapers and that crazy stuff , " Adams says . <p> One element of this draft business was predicted by Young 's mentor and friend , Steve McNair , the Titans quarterback who coincidentally has been barred from working out at team headquarters amid the expectation the team will draft his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to do everything , try everything , to bring you down . They will say any and everything about you , ' " Young says . " He was right . " <p> When Young says he 's looking forward to the immediate days after the draft so he can get away to recharge , it offers a clue to how draining the scrutiny has been . " This whole process has been fun , but it 's been stressful , too . " <p> The last time Young was seen in live action , he was capturing the nation 's fancy with his performance against Southern California in the Rose Bowl . Making plays with his legs and arm , he sparked a rally from a 12-point , fourth-quarter deficit to lead Texas to its first national crown since 1970 . <p> Since then , however , he 's taken hits from every angle . <p> Doubters appear <p> At the scouting combine in late February , there were anonymous reports that alluded to Young 's score on the 50-question , Wonderlic IQ exam . Generally , red flags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test , typically leading to additional testing that delves into how a player grasps and processes information . <p> Young wonders if he was a victim of a misinformation campaign waged this time of year to affect draft status . " That 's someone hating , trying to make it look like I 'm dumb , which I know I 'm not , " Young says . " But it was also disrespectful , just how it got out . For the first time in history , somebody 's score gets out and gets talked about like that . Somebody wants to find something on me , which was n't even true . It was horrible . " <p> Texans GM Charley Casserly insists the Wonderlic is not a tool to make a definitive judgment about a prospect , given that players have been known to get " coached up " for the exam as they would for an SAT . Young says he has had much discussion with teams trying to gauge the most effective way for him to learn , although that probably would be the case regardless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know how fast I will be ready to play , " he says . <p> Casserly says : " It 's more about the instincts . He can learn . His biggest adjustment is going from a shotgun offense to taking snaps from under center . And like all quarterbacks , he 'll have to get used to a different terminology . " <p> Ready or not <p> Leinart , who played in a pro-style offense in college , is considered more prepared to play as a rookie . But Casserly cautions against reading much into that for long-term gains . He ripped off a list of Pro Bowl-credentialed quarterbacks who watched from the sideline as rookies  --  including McNair , Donovan McNabb and Tom Brady  --  and envisions Young perhaps following a similar path . <p> Still , another question mark surrounding Young ( 6-5 , 229 ) has been his mechanics . His delivery , although bolstered by a quick release , is somewhat side-armed . <p> It 's a delicate issue : A low release point increases the chances for passes to be batted at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the nation with a 163.9 pass efficiency rating last season . <p> Young does n't want to change much but has been working with former NFL quarterbacks coach Jerry Rhome . Young says McNair advised him to bring his shoulders up , and Rhome has been helping him develop better footwork . <p> " Coach Rhome says the way I throw the ball helps me with my quick release , " Young says . " That 's how I throw the ball to get it from Point A to Point B. That 's all that really matters . " <p> Gil Brandt , the ex-Dallas Cowboys personnel director who is a draft consultant for the NFL , says Young did much to convince the approximately 150 representatives from teams who witnessed his pro day workout . In working for nearly 40 minutes taking snaps from under center and throwing a variety of passes , Young completed 49 of 54 passes ( including one drop ) . <p> " That was something special , " Brandt says during a phone interview . " Everybody went looking to see what was wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> With athleticism that helped Young amass 4,086 passing and rushing yards in 2005 and make history against Oklahoma State last season when he became the first NCAA player to top 230 yards passing and 230 yards rushing in a game , comparisons to Atlanta Falcons double-threat star Michael Vick are inevitable . <p> Brandt says that is unfair . " The difference between Vince Young and Michael Vick is like New York City and Big Sky Montana , " he says . " Everybody wants to lump him with Vick . This guy is a passing quarterback first . Vick is a running quarterback first . " <p> Young , who won the Davey O'Brien Award last season as the nation 's best quarterback , seems intent on proving that on the next level . " I felt good about the O'Brien Award because it was for the most outstanding quarterback , " he says . " A lot of people said I was n't a quarterback , so I answered them on that . But it 's always something . <p> " It 's like people want to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . But it 's my calling , my blessing . So I 'm not going to fail . I 've got the man upstairs as my protector , and I 'm going to continue using all the crap as motivation . ... So you might as well hop on the bandwagon and give me my respect .
