<p> Ron Jaworski remembers sitting through three-hour quarterback meetings after 2 1/2-hour workouts in Philadelphia with his driven coach , Dick Vermeil . <p> A few weeks ago , they were together again in St. Louis , where Vermeil has the energized Rams favored to reach the Super Bowl as NFC champions . <p> " Dick invited me to dinner on Saturday night , " says Jaworski , now an ESPN analyst . " I walked in about 7:30 , and Dick was in the kitchen cooking salmon . <p> " Coach , " Jaworski said , " I remember when John Sciarra 's wife was having a baby on Saturday night and you would n't let him leave the hotel . " <p> But now Dick Vermeil has seen golden leaves tossed by an autumn wind . He has told stories of faraway places to a granddaughter on his lap . And on this Saturday night Vermeil was home , as were all the members of the Rams ' family . <p> Jim Hanifan , Vermeil 's offensive line coach , has been moving in NFL circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his players to bed at home on Saturday nights . " We have a Saturday walk-through at home , and the next time we see the fellas is Sunday morning for breakfast , " Hanifan says . <p> The day before Christmas , Vermeil agreed to change the time of an 11 a.m. workout but refused to cancel it . Yet when the Rams executed a near-flawless practice , Vermeil shouted " the hell with it " and gave them Christmas Day off . <p> Quarterback Kurt Warner , who made the request , is one of nine players on a got-a-gripe executive committee . " One player from each position , " says Vermeil , brightening . " We have n't had one meeting this season . " <p> Of course , in Philadelphia , where Vermeil coached with a sense of urgency for seven years , there was never any thought given to complaints . Vermeil was sometimes referred to as the " Little Dictator " because of his whip-cracking style . <p> " He 's mellowed , " Jaworski says , " but he still gets his message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to sell Cadillac Eldorados and Blue Cross-Blue Shield insurance in TV commercials is still youthful but framed by graying , neatly cropped hair . Vermeil is 63 , a little guy with the waistline of a jogger and the knowing eyes of a small-town doctor . <p> Learning to relax <p> On Jan. 10 , 1983 , Vermeil announced he had coached his final game for the Eagles . He stood misty-eyed with a heavy heart . And when he spoke , he introduced the media to the term " coaching burnout . " <p> " I do n't know what it was about Dick , " says Marion Campbell , who succeeded Vermeil in Philadelphia . " That man did n't get turned on ' til the night . Then he went into high gear . " <p> Vermeil , who slept three nights a week in his stadium office , retired to a career in sports television . He learned to relax with a glass of California red wine and Neil Diamond tapes when he was n't hunting with former players . <p> He and Carol , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home on a 100-acre site in Coatesville , Pa. , about 45 miles outside Philadelphia . They designed the home , called " Yosemite Lodge " by Kansas City Chiefs general manager Carl Peterson , Vermeil 's longtime friend . Vermeil helped with the construction , using a tractor given him by former owner Leonard Tose . <p> Thirteen years after his burnout speech , Vermeil jumped back on the NFL coaching carousel . An old friend , Rams owner Georgia Frontiere , hired him to rebuild a fading team . The Rams had produced one defensive Pro Bowler in seven years , tackle Sean Gilbert , then traded him . <p> " It was a tough decision to come back , " Vermeil says . " I was out for so long and had a number of inquiries . But I always said no . It finally got to a point where I felt better about myself and my own self-control . The ' Eagle thing ' stimulated it . All of a sudden , it made me realize that , hey , there 's still a fire there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer in 1995 from Jeffrey Lurie , Philly 's dashing new owner and Hollywood filmmaker . When the lawyers could n't agree on money or power , Vermeil had to wait two years until the " Ram thing " developed . <p> No excuses <p> The Rams struggled in Vermeil 's first two years . The media drums began beating , suggesting the game had passed him by . Vermeil never noticed . And now , in Vermeil 's third year , with only nine players left from his first team and 16 new starters , the Rams are just two home wins from the Super Bowl . <p> " When we are really humming and executing , " Vermeil says , " we 're tough because everybody can make a play . " <p> Even before Warner began his storybook season , Vermeil was sure the Rams were going to be a special team . " When we got Marshall Faulk , I said , ' That 's the icing on the cake , ' " he says . " We have no excuses for not getting it done . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list the reasons the Rams could fail . <p> " I listed , No. 1 , injury , and No. 2 , not doing a good enough job coaching , " he says . <p> The Rams have more speed and more playmakers than any other team in the playoffs . They are 8-0 at home in the Trans World Dome , where the sound is like 66,000 screaming rock fans with mikes . <p> The big names on offense , of course , are Warner , who threw 41 touchdown passes ; Faulk , who gained a record 2,429 yards from scrimmage ; explosive receiver Isaac Bruce ; and Orlando Pace , a tackle the size of a courthouse . On defense , they are speed rusher Kevin Carter , cornerback Todd Lyght , underrated tackle D'Marco Farr and linebacker London Fletcher . <p> As the keeper of all this talent , Vermeil lives by a simple philosophy . <p> " I 've always felt that players win games , not coaches , " he says . " So you 've got to get good football players . And so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> And the coach better have a hard edge . He 'd better be organized . And he 'd better have a solid staff of assistants , young and old , to motivate his players in a free-agency era that pulls teams into crazy spins . <p> Vermeil is and has all that . But he clearly is no longer the " Little Dictator " who worked the Eagles on July 4 during Philadelphia 's bicentennial celebration . <p> " We were in a meeting about 9 o'clock , and we heard the sound of fireworks , " recalls Peterson , then Vermeil 's tight ends coach . " Dick told me , ' I do n't know what 's going on , Carl , but go out there and tell them to knock it off . ' " <p> Vigor remains <p> Vermeil has delegated more authority to his staffers . " I 'm more of a suggestion-maker and an evaluator , " he says . " In certain situations , a decision-maker . And you know , I 'm not as tense as I used to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has surrendered a few hours from the daily grind , but not any of what Hanifan calls " the vigor . " Vermeil learned the ethic repairing cars in father Louie Vermeil 's garage in Calistoga , Calif. , aptly called the Night Owl . <p> " We were in high school , " Carol Vermeil says . " We used to work on his car , a ' 36 Ford coupe , together . I learned how to change a carburetor . I was hanging around his house all the time . " <p> The Night Owl shop was located near the Vermeil home . <p> " The boys were all expected to work in the garage , " she says . " The garage was right there , about 150 feet behind the house . It was part of their life . " <p> The sport of football , however , was Vermeil 's high calling . He was a little option quarterback at Calistoga High and later at San Jose State . At one point when he was mulling a return to the NFL , Vermeil came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " is the only thing I really know something about . Something I can compete with other experts on , anyway . " <p> When old friends inquire about him , the question is always the same : How much has he changed with the Rams ? <p> " All the quirks are still there , " says Lynn Stiles , a vice president and tight ends coach . " But he 's not digging ditches like he used to . He can stand and look at the horizon . He 's developed a great chemistry , and it 's not just the athletes . It transcends the whole organization . And he 's letting the lieutenants make decisions . " <p> Carol Vermeil acknowledges being concerned that her husband would revert to his 16-hour workday . <p> " He cares so much about everybody , " she says . " I was concerned he would start spreading himself too thin again . " <p> Vermeil was too smart for that .
