Julia wins critics raves , Dut real-lite sleuth Erin Brockovich gets the prize for pluck , passion and plunging necklines Photograph Working with ill plaintiffs " taught me the value of family , " says Brockovich ( near her Agoura Hills , Calif. , home last week ) . // Erin Brockovich wants to set the record straight : She is not exactly the trash-talking , cleavagebaring hellion that Erin Brockovich 's Julia Roberts makes her out to be . Okay , so the swearing part is right . " Sometimes , " says the 39-year-old researcher at the L.A. law firm of Masry &; Vititoe , " a simple F-you is the only thing that works . " And she does admit to a penchant for the low-cut tops that Roberts wears in nearly every scene . " I do dress that way , " says Brockovich with a laugh , but " I 'd never let my bra strap hang out like Julia does . Never . " Call it harmless error . As Brockovich is the first to say , the tale depicted in Brockovich-Roberts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " right on . " Eight years ago she was a struggling , divorced mother of three who wrangled an $800-a-month clerical job in a small law firm only to discover  --  after sorting through the file on a pro bono real estate case-that a utility company was contaminating a town 's water supply . In between juggling endless child-care crises and a hunky , Harley-loving boyfriend , she helped win one of the largest class-action lawsuits in history . Brockovich co-executive producer Carla Santos Shamberg first heard the story at the office of the chiropractor she shares with Brockovich . Though at first skeptical of Shamberg 's interest , Brockovich gave the green light . Still , sitting today in her French-country-decorated five  --  bedroom ranch house in L.A. , she ca n't quite believe that her life story is playing at the multiplex . Says Brockovich : " It 's very , very weird . " Photograph " Erin has a tremendous drive to succeed , " says Ed Masry ( at Brockovich 's home ) . Photograph Her divorces and working hours have been hard on ( left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew . Says Brockovich : " I 'd be lying if I said they did n't have tough times . " // But probably not as weird as the sight , some six years ago , of a striking 5 ' ' 9 " blonde in high heels knocking on the doors of house after house in Hinkley , Calif. , talking to residents about the possible link between the chromium once used by the local Pacific Gas &; Electric Company plant and the rash of ailments-from nosebleeds to cancer  --  striking the community . " When I saw Erin get out of her car , I thought , " Oh my God , " " recalls Valerie Bruce , 37 , whose husband suffers from brain damage . " But she 's more than a great body . She 's smart and honest and forthcoming . " Like many of the approximately 600 plaintiffs who settled for a total of $333 million from PG &E,; Bruce has a mixed reaction to the payoff : " Some of us felt people needed to go to jail for what they did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Getting such a wonderful settlement in such a short period of time was a miracle . And Erin played a huge role in that . " A role that came as little surprise to her sister , Jodie Knight , 49 , a health-care provider in Silver City , N.Mex . " Erin has always operated in extremes , " says Knight with a chuckle , " whether an extremely foul mouth or an extremely big heart . " The youngest child of Frank Pattee , a retired engineer , and Betty Jo , a retired journalist , both 76 ( brother Frank Jr. , 52 , Is a baking company distributor in Topeka , Kans. ; Tommy died at 36 in 1994 from a severe allergic reaction ) , Erin was , recalls Frank , " fun-loving . " At Lawrence High School in Lawrence , Kans. , Brockovich was less interested in studying than in boyfriends , buddies and the occasional beer . " Life was great , " she says . But the great life ended when Brockovich graduated in 1978 . After earning a fashion merchandising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ management trainee for Kmart in Newport Beach , Calif. , in 1981 . Unsatisfied , she quit several months later to try her luck in potentially lucrative beauty pageants . That year she was named NEss Pacific Coast , but Brockovich found the contest world " shallow " and gave it up . In 1982 she married restaurant manager Shawn Brown , eventually moved to Reno and within four years gave birth to Matthew , now 16 , and Katie , 15 . But as Brockovich says , she and Shawn " had troubles we could n't fix . " In 1987 they divorced , and she began dating stockbroker Steven Brockovich . They were married in 1989 , she says , but " my kids were n't accepting of him and he could n't handle the stress . " Their 1990 divorce had just become final when she found out she was pregnant with Beth , now 9 . As for Brown , " I did n't even know where he was , " says Brockovich . And Steven Brockovich , who has never seen Beth , paid support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all parental rights in order to avoid paying child support . ) In 1991 , Brockovich hired Masry &; Vititoe to sue a driver who had hit her car-and later persuaded them to hire her to do , she says , " anything . Ed Masry still teases that if I misbehave , I 'm on bathroom duty again . " Not likely . " The most impressive thing about Erin is her brain , " says Masry , 67 , who paid her more than $2 million for her PG &E; work . " She put her heart and soul into that case . " And then some . According to Brockovich , her obsession with the case contributed to the end of her 18-month relationship with Jorge Halaby , played in the film by Aaron Eckhart . ( She has n't had contact with him for two years . ) She also believes her contact with samples of contaminated dirt and water caused her to develop a tumor in her nose . But most difficult was the toll her work took on her kids . Last year , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send Matthew and Katie to out-of-state boarding schools when they became chronic truants and started using drugs . " It was tough love , " she says . " I cried for hours after I dropped my son off at the airport . But I did n't want to bury my head in the sand . " Today , she phones and writes both kids several times a week-in between 15-hour days working on seven new toxic-litigation cases . But no one is complaining-certainly not Eric Ellis , the 34  --  year-old actor she married last March . " Erin 's tenacious and very set in her ways , " says Ellis . " But that 's what drove me to her . " Either that or those miniskirts . After a recent appearance along with Roberts on The Oprah Winfrey Show , Brockovich got a call from Matthew , who said , " All my friends were going , " Dude , that 's your mom ? " " But it was his reaction that touched her .
