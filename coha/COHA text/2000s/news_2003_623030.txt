<p> Watching Catherine Zeta-Jones wind her thighs ' round the back of a chair in the opening dance number of " Chicago , " I thought of George W. Bush 's national security strategy ; how far the invention of one is from the invention of the other . Released in Sept. , 2002 , the security strategy announced Bush 's intent to use pre-emptive military action against countries he perceives to be hostile and to stop nations from challenging U.S. military supremacy . <p> I liked " Chicago " on Broadway , and liked it better on film , where Rob Marshall adapts the leggy choreography ( by Bob Fosse ) to the screen and knows where to put the camera to catch it . I liked the film because its ideas are clearer  --  oh yes , the musical with more garter belts than " Cabaret " has ideas . <p> Watching Eminem shuffle nervously back and forth in " 8 Mile , " revving himself up to grunt his nasty poems , I tried  --  and failed  --  to make one picture of his America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sept. 11 of non-nationals and U.S. citizens without providing access to lawyers or notification to families , a practice ruled constitutional on Jan. 8 , 2003 . <p> I thought of the increased powers of the FBI and CIA and new powers of the Homeland Security Department aided by the Orwellian-sounding Total Information Awareness computer system which , linking medical , financial and commercial databases , can tell intelligence agencies and the cops when you last ordered from Amazon.com or had your colon checked  --  information it may now retrieve without a court warrant or evidence , like Santa has , of whether you 've been bad . <p> Eminem got rid of the misogyny and homophobia for the big screen and left his sex-and-race charged rhymes . In the film , Eminem and his buddies drive their jalopy across parts of Detroit that rival 1945 Dresden . <p> I watched Eminem shuffle and Renee Zellweger promise her best pout as she tries to steal the show from Zeta-Jones ' glittery kicks , and I thought of the strange mis-identification between the American government and people . We elect it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looks at the U.S. unilateralism and military build-up will have to look also at this . " Chicago , " " 8 Mile , " Spielberg 's " Catch Me if You Can , " and Scorsese 's " Gangs of New York " are us . <p> The misidentification is the result of the size and diversity of the nation such that no government could possibly represent us all . The government , or parts of Congress , may represent parts of us , but Americans do not identify with it . It is not the source of the myths , plans and scams that scream on the streets . <p> Whatever you may think of them , " American Beauty " and " Do the Right Thing " are us . Bruce Willis , Charlton Heston and Susan Sarandon are us . " In the Company of Men " and " Pretty Woman " are us . " Apocalypse Now " and " The Trials of Henry Kissinger " are us . " Arlington Road " , about the mania of the far-right , and " Bulworth " , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dumb and Dumber " and " Bowling for Columbine " both are us . <p> These come from many " us " s that butt against each other , vying for space and a piece of the pie  --  the blues singers , bowlers , Rotary Clubs , rappers , soccer moms , Christian Identity and the devotees of telenovellas . The engine on the ground does n't come from the top . There are no government subsidies that shelter this clutter , and even when there are  --  crop supports , corporate write-offs , and the steel tariffs that so angered the EU last year  --  the beneficiaries are as leery of government as were Jesse James and Billy the Kid . <p> Americans watch the French rely on the government to put quotas on American movies , to shield the products of its people , and we are dumbstruck . Bush shielding Eminem or Zeta-Jones ' thighs ? <p> American people will march to the military drum , except when they are isolationist , or far-right anti-government militia , or Mothers Against Drunk Driving who do n't want their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more worried about their retirement portfolios . Or when , after 10-hour days working on insurance auditing , they spend their evening hours at the local peace movement . <p> The misidentification does not mean that the U.S. government had no part in churning the growth of the country . It did , in land deals , annihilation of the Native Americans , cheap loans , canals , railroads , territorial wars , the public schools , subsidies to industry and agribusiness , and manipulation of interest rates , taxes and tariffs . But perhaps by accident of immigration and the trek West , America pushed out through what Tocqueville called " local independence . " The government pulled itself together to build an infrastructure to manage the mess on the ground . More new territory was occupied in the generation after Independence than in the 150 years of the colonial era . By 1800 , sale of Western land increased to half a million acres , up from 100,000 just a decade earlier , and by 1820 the trans-Appalachian population had grown to over 2 million , up from one-third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplish this without the government , but often they led rather than followed . Americans believe the government did , and they have been as distrustful of it as much as they constitute it . <p> The Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh is well within American traditions . Americans  --  immigrants or recent immigrants  --  have believed they invented it all , and when whatever they had did n't suit , they re-invented it and moved on , to another chance , another scheme , another kind of music and self . <p> This essential movement of America , volatile and creative , makes its way around the government , in spite of it , or in disregard . Even American nostalgia for " the good ol ' days " is a longing for adventure , frontiers and " rugged individualism , " or for new towns with that fresh-paint smell of possibility , and more " personal responsibility , " youth working its way up and " boot-strap " business , and the wildcat inventions of the dot-com boom . It is a nostalgia for the new . <p> Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would thrum at the " Gangs of New York " ad line : America was born in the streets ! Yes ! We , one scruffy group after the next , scuffed it up by ourselves , and made somethin ' outta ' the dust . <p> Germany was born in Bismarck 's battles , a consolidation of the " homelands " that for centuries had been filled with traditions , people and seats of power . Much of the rest of Europe consolidated under the kings ' absolute control . Even England , country of constrained kings , was born by an accident of tax law that kept the monarch dependent on Parliament for money and then for everything else . <p> " Gangs of New York " is as good a case as any of the mind-set on the ground : Get yourself a vision  --  and every Pashtun cabbie has one  --  and then work , fight , and gamble , gamble , gamble your way into your own invention . <p> Want to know why America is rich  --  and it is rich : average annual income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the latter group richer than 95 percent of the planet and richer than 99.9 percent of the people who ever lived . It 's rich because , as David Brooks wrote in The New York Times , " Americans perpetually , and not always unrealistically , sense the imminence of great wealth . In the land of abundance , there are all these wonderful spots just over the next hill or with the next spouse , or with the next job opportunity , after the next deck renovation or lottery ticket , where all the dreams come true . " <p> In 2000 , 19 percent of Americans told a Time magazine survey that they were in the top 1 percent of earners and another 20 percent expected to reach it . In America , people are , as Brooks wrote , " pre-rich . " <p> " Gangs " is not a good film . The sets , apparently filched from the Cincinnati run of " Turandot , " are overlaid with hyper-realist violence until it turns into " Braveheart " with a touch of " Hamlet " angst , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rippers " and " Pretty Baby " breasts for the cherry on top . But it sprays more myth on the screen than blood . <p> The Irish came and lived in filth ; their children floated paper boats in the butcher 's ooze in the streets . They were beaten to a pulp , bribed their way into city government and became it . Much of the " big " money in New York is still " Irish . " About mid-way through " Gangs , " a " Negro " taps a dance that looks like a Holy Roller imitating Fred Astaire and the boys at the bar spit tobacco juice . " Take the rhythm of the dark continent , " one says , " and the Irish jig , ya ' mix it all up and that makes America . " <p> The government did n't do the mixing . Leon Wynter in " American Skin " writes that the markets and culture  --  not government policies  --  have been where the 140 languages and traditions here have mixed it up . <p> On one hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sikhs ( mistaking their traditional turban for Islamic garb ) in vigilante retaliations . <p> On the other , America is home to Arabic rap and a new play about four lesbians in an Islamic cafe . If the " mix " is a myth , Americans have nonetheless pushed themselves into being what they think they already are , even as we critique the process . <p> The critique is another re-invention of the self . Now we are not only scruffy fighters on the frontiers of " pre-rich " and cultural re-mixes , we are self-aware . We are savvy , clearer about the myths that blind us and allow us to improbably succeed  --  or to believe , like that hopeful 39 percent , that we will . We sell ourselves on ourselves even as we deconstruct the process in post-structuralist journals and made-for-mall movies , which are now at once myth and exegesis . <p> In America , exposes have never stopped the business of re-packaging and sales . <p> " Chicago " is a critique and sister film to " Wag the Dog . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fixer recruits a Hollywood director to shoot a non-existent war to distract the public from the president 's less laudable affairs . The director succeeds not because Hollywood specifically can sell anything but because America generally has always been about re-packaging , what you are and what you peddle , for good and evil . <p> What did the Irish do if not re-package and find themselves a power niche ? The rest of the European immigration followed , doing what the Bengalis and Ecuadorans do today . The re-invention that grew the country from the 1803 Louisiana Purchase to Silicon Valley re-packaged snake oil " cures " and junk bonds , the shady scam of the ' 80s now called " high-yield instruments . " <p> " Chicago " is about selling not a war but justice . Two dames in Prohibition Chicago are on Death Row for killing their fellas and the best lawyer in town is the best because he remakes each gal into the public 's sweetheart , and sells the jury on her innocence . Blooming from vicious killer to wide-eyed maid misled by booze and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' do , as they said in " Rocky , " another commentary of the engine on the American ground . <p> The hero of Spielberg 's " Catch Me If You Can " one-ups the stakes by re-inventing himself over and over  --  into an airline pilot , doctor , lawyer  --  and forging a few billion dollars in checks to support his select lifestyles . Every Gold Rush gambler with a card up his sleeve would have been proud . At the end , the kid gets caught and thrown in the slammer , until he reinvents himself as an FBI agent in the forgery division . <p> At the end of " Wag the Dog " when the " war " subsides , the director gets a hankering to tell the world about his best " film " and the president 's fixer has to provide him with a heart attack to shut him up . The government has real power . But it is not the power of the gamble on the ground , and this throws a tragi-comic clunk into global anti-Americanism . <p> Guys in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Jakartan anti-America demonstrator named Rahmat , vowing to defend his Muslim brothers in Afghanistan after 9/11 , asked a Western reporter if he could take him back to America to see Michael Jordan . By the way , " Catch Me If You Can " is based on a true story.Marcia Pally is the author of two books on censorship and freedom of expression , " Sex &; Sensibility : Reflections on Forbidden Mirrors and the Will to Censor " and " Sense &; Censorship : The Vanity of Bonfires.
