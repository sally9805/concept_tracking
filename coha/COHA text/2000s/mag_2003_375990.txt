The Democrats staged the first of six presidential primary debates in Albuquerque , N.M. , last week , and it was n't exactly gladiatorial . No blood was spilled , no memorable lines unsheathed . The candidates were not eloquent , funny , clever or incisive . No one was embarrassed  --  except , perhaps , those who attempted to speak Spanish ( the event was sponsored by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus ) . But the debate may prove to be a turning point , nonetheless . It illuminated a critical decision <P> the Democrats now face  --  between principled opposition to the Bush Administration and populist demagoguery on the two main issues of this election , the war and the economy . This is a particularly crucial choice for Howard Dean , who wants to build his candidacy past Internet insurgency toward a broader audience . Indeed , Dean 's subdued and awkward performance , and his slipperiness on both issues , seemed a rare moment of indecision in what has been a steamroller campaign . <P> The Democrats were more united than they had ever been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , as Dick Gephardt said , a " miserable failure " in the postwar period . All the major candidates favored a deal with the U.N . to bring more foreign troops into the peacekeeping operations ; none counseled retreat . But a minor candidate , Congressman Dennis Kucinich , threw down a wildly provocative challenge : " We should bring the troops home now . " This , I fear , is a position with a future . Many polls are showing significant public ambivalence about America 's commitment to rebuild Iraq  --  and a clear-cut desire to spend less , not more , money on the occupation . Such sentiments will increase , no doubt , as the occupation slogs on , the casualties and bills mount . The U.S. military dreads another Baghdad summer . By next spring the door will be wide open for a **26;16687;TOOLONG challenge to the President . Happily , none of the major Democrats chose to walk through that utterly irresponsible door last week , but Dean  --  who is on the record as favoring more American troops and more money  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops , they are going to be foreign troops , " the former Governor said , changing his position and glancing warily over at Kucinich , who hopes to dent Dean 's support in the peaceable kingdom of Iowa . " Ours need to come home . "
