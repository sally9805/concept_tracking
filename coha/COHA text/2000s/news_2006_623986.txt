<p> Paul Saffo gets paid to look ahead at the trends , technologies and companies of Silicon Valley . But please do n't call him a futurist . <p> In a wide-ranging interview , Saffo , who works with the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park , described himself as a " professional bystander " who uses the history of technology to forecast what may lie ahead . <p> Saffo , who also teaches at Stanford University 's School of Engineering , described the world as being in the midst of a media revolution that is " blowing right down the hallways " of publications like The Chronicle . <p> The quick-witted Saffo occasionally turned the tables on the reporters and editors who questioned him . When one journalist asked him how technology is changing the way young people learn , Saffo , 51 , turned to two high school students who happened to be observing the session and quipped that the question should have been directed at them . <p> What follows is an edited version of an hour-long interview in which Saffo balanced his fears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more hopeful view that technology will elevate moderation over extremism  --  even if the digital future turns out to be more suburban than utopian . <p> Q : You call yourself a forecaster . Some people call you a futurist . Is there a difference ? <p> A : People who call themselves futurists do n't have a sense of history of the term . It dates back to the early 1900s . Tied into fascism , these guys would have parties and go hang out and stroke the streamlined lines of new cars . I think of futurists as people who have a particular attitude about the future . They 're advocates for a certain kind of outcome . As a forecaster I am something very different . I am a professional bystander . I have opinions about the future , of course . But my whole posture is to be detached and to identify what I think will happen and not allow my judgments of what should happen to get involved . <p> Q : Like a journalist . <p> A : The fact is that you and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to help our audiences make sense of what lies ahead . The only difference is your audience pays less per report than mine do . <p> Q : What makes you qualified to look into the crystal ball ? <p> A : We have a whole set of formal methodologies for the Institute . We 've been around since 1967 so we have a track record . This is systematically applied common sense and intuition . The message I give my clients is that anybody can do this and everybody should do this . You do n't want to rely on an expert to tell you what lies ahead . The answer is I have a bunch of fancy degrees , but the fact is any thinking person is qualified to be a forecaster , and in fact , everybody does it every day . <p> Q : How has technology impacted how young people learn and how they get information ? <p> A : ( Saffo asks Walnut Creek high school students Christine Lei and Jocelyn Sears , visiting the newspaper on a job-shadowing exercise , which they use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " About the same , " he continues . ) I have a sister who is a professor . She was complaining that she ca n't talk to her son who 's a sophomore at the University of Chicago . " He wo n't answer my e-mails , " she says . I told her , " Well sis , get on instant messaging , because he does n't use e-mail . " She said , " I hate instant messaging . " If you are 40 , you use e-mail and not instant messaging . The thing I see happening is that there 's a real compression between generations . There used to be about 20 years difference ( in technology use ) . Now you talk to 15-year-old kids and their 9-year-old brother or sister is using stuff that they do n't understand . <p> Q : Because of the number of hours younger people use e-mail and the Internet , and play video games , are they processing and absorbing information differently than they were before television ? <p> A : I think that is absolutely true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would rather interact electronically than face-to-face . It does not mean that if you 're a fortysomething that you 're doomed to be clueless . It 's not like learning a foreign language where you have to begin at 5 years old or you 're sunk . I think older generations can get into things like multiplayer games and instant messaging if for no other reason than to talk to teenagers . It 's interesting to see the lament of each generation overwhelmed by the next new tool . I can show you passages from scholars of Germany in the 1480s lamenting the fact that they are overloaded with all this stuff to read because of the printing press . <p> Q : You 've written that " Information Age " is " a profoundly wrongheaded description " of our times . What would be a better phrase ? <p> A : It 's not information . It 's media . This is why I think it 's been so hard for traditional media to cover what 's going on . I ca n't imagine how you can find the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the winds of which are blowing right down the hallways of the publication you work for . That 's like an orthopedic surgeon trying to perform arthroscopic surgery on their own knee . It 's possible , but it 's hard to see through all the pain . It really is a media revolution and I think the closest parallel is what happened in the 1950s with the rise of television . The arrival of television established a mass-media order that dominated the last 50 years . This is a personal media revolution . The distinction between the old order and the new order is very important . Television delivered the world to our living room . In the old media , all we could do was press our noses against the glass and watch . This new world of personal media  --  the Web , the Internet and et cetera  --  not only delivers the world to your living rooms , but everywhere . And we get to answer back . And we 're expected to answer back . <p> Q : What are the practical results of this compression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? <p> A : Sometimes I wonder if this pressure to constantly respond begins to look like a disease-state . We 've become more and more interrupt-driven . If you have six tasks to do in an hour , you ca n't just take 60 minutes and divide and have 10 minutes per task . You have 10 minutes per task minus the time required for context-shifting . That will be the next big challenge : figuring out how to fight the distraction-driven mode we 're in and stay focused on one thing long enough to get it done . Every new thing upsets people . We all know someone that has a teenage kid who sits in the room and the television is on , their iPod is on , they have the computer on and at least three other electronic devices going while they 're doing their homework . It drives the dad nuts , but he ca n't complain because the kid 's a 4.1 ( GPA ) student . Think about reading : Today , parents would love it if their kids read books more because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parents were upset because their kids were reading dime-store novels . Parents would say , " I do n't want you inside reading anymore . Get outside and play . " I guarantee you , in 50 years or so , parents are going to say , " You 're not going outside to play until you finish that video game . " <p> Q : Can we continue to speed things up or is there a logical limit to information overload ? <p> A : I do n't think information overload is a function of the volume of information . It 's a derivative of the volume of information plus the sense-making tools you have . Think about the rise of info-graphics in newspapers . Those were sense-making tools to help people ( absorb information ) . You can bookmark your Web pages . Now we have things like ( the Web site ) Del.icio.us that allow you to create tags to share and organize Web pages . In my class , we 're using a wiki ( a Web page that is like an open bulletin board ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  that 's a sense-making tool . These are tools that help us make sense of information . I think it was Samuel Johnson who said , " There are two kinds of information in this world : that what you know and that what you know where to get . " The tools help the latter , and that 's what keeps us from going nuts . The sense of overload comes from the gap between that sudden jump in volume ( of information ) and the tools we have to make sense of it . <p> Q : How does the speed of information and the way we obtain information impact our culture and politics ? <p> A : As a global society we are performing a great experiment on ourselves . Half of the world population wants to race faster into the future . Go visit China and India . They 're ready to go . And half of the world wants to drag us into the past . The problem is both sides have guns . I think there really is a reaction . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is information-sharing a force for peace or a force for conflict , or does it matter ? <p> A : No . More information and more communications foster world peace and understanding . But connecting extremist nut cases together on the Web  --  whatever flavor extremism they are  --  is a really bad thing . More information may not be a good thing , either . As recently as the ' 70s , people were forced to see information that they did n't agree with in newspapers and the like . Now there is so much information you really can build your own walled garden that just has the stuff that reinforces your view . I think it applies to all of us . People are really going into these separate camps , and that 's the big social challenge in this age of too much information . How do we crack that and create a common dialogue ? <p> Q : You talk about the benefits of using wikis and a divergence of thought . How do the two things come together ? What are your thoughts on the reliability @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A : I 'm actually an optimist about what lies ahead . Are wikis reliable ? It depends on the specific business . Is Wikipedia reliable ? You bet . Wikipedia is a researcher 's dream . <p> Q : What about efforts to limit information ? We 've had the major search engines comply with China 's rules about filtering certain kinds of results . <p> A : What 's happening in China is frightening , and the acquiescence of companies in it is also very frightening . People were touchingly naive at the dawn of the Internet revolution when they said the Internet will route around censorship the way it routes around damage . With any revolution , the establishment catches up and figures out how to screw it up . The answer is to keep technology advancing fast enough so that those who would try to control it ca n't . It 's up to people to defend what they care about . We should n't be complacent that this stuff is going to be a force for good . <p> Q : So did Google do the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not ( Google CEO ) Eric Schmidt . They stood up to the feds ( by fighting a subpoena seeking search records to explore whether there is a need for new Internet child pornography laws ) and it 's " Yea ! " Then it comes to the Chinese government and it 's " How could you disappoint us ? " It 's such a dynamic situation . Who knows what pressure was put on them . I 'm not sure I would want to judge unless I was in their shoes . <p> Q : Do you think Google is the exemplary new-age corporation ? <p> A : Stock prices turn people 's heads . When prices are high , we treat a company like gods , and if they drop , we treat them as fools . It 's important not to overstate what 's going on . Google was the right set of people at the right time , and they ended up doing the right set of things . It 's worth looking at how they are managed . They are network-oriented and allow a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerging technologies have your attention ? <p> A : Let 's start with the obvious one , biology . The human genome being decoded was an indicator of where that field is going . If you look at the last 150 years , about every 30 years or so , a new scientific discipline emerges that starts spinning out technologies and capturing people 's imaginations . Go back to 1900 : That industry was chemistry . People had chemistry sets . In the 1930s , it was the rise of physics and physicists . They build on each other . Chemists laid the experimental understanding for the physicists to build their theories . It was three physicists who invented the transistor in 1947 . That started the information revolution . Today , kids get computers . <p> Q : Talking about information overload , what about digital photos and e-mails and stuff that we just keep adding and never delete . <p> A : On the bright side , at least you do n't have boxes of pictures filling up your house . There 's something about a collector mentality . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasons : to be useful , to tell each other stories and to collect stuff . It 's the only explanation for eBay . We love to collect stuff , and at least if we 're collecting stuff in cyberspace we 're not deforesting the Sierra Nevada . <p> Q : Are we running any risk of storing important data digitally and then not being able to retrieve it in 50 years ? <p> A : As Stewart Brand ( co-founder of Emeryville 's Global Business Network ) likes to say , " Information lasts forever . Digital information lasts forever or for five years , whichever comes first . " There are examples everywhere . The tapes from the original Viking landers that went to Mars are at ( NASA 's ) Jet Propulsion Laboratory , but there is no machine that can read the tapes . Every day huge amounts of information break off like icebergs and melt away . What worries me is that much information in electronic form is never reduced to paper . Some people have described this as being on the edge of a digital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of amnesia . <p> Q : Is n't that an indictment of the digital revolution , that there could be a huge hole in the archives and library of our times ? <p> A : I 'm worried enough about it that I 'm on the board of the Long Now Foundation , which is based in San Francisco . One of our projects has been figuring out how we can store things for 10,000 years so they can still be read . There is an interesting counter-idea here : I worry about a society that can remember everything . ( He asks the students if they keep online journals and whether they would feel self-conscious if anyone read them . They say no because their online writings are not personal . ) The difference between our collective generation and your generation ( differentiating the reporters from the students ) is that we poured our souls out on paper that got easily yellowed and lost . The danger is that many of your friends ( nodding at the students ) are putting intimate ideas in cyberspace journals . So when today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag out all of that idiotic stuff at their class reunion . The curse of cyberspace is that everything we want to preserve will get lost and everything we want to lose will be preserved . <p> Q : Do you think people will pass away and leave so much of their lives stored in digital form that their survivors will have to deal with a digital afterlife ? <p> A : I remember that the first digital suicide was someone on the Well ( a pioneering online community ) . I think it was about 1988 or 1989 , and there was one person who , just before they committed suicide , went on the Well and used their status as a system administrator to delete everything about themself . That 's an indication there is something very profound here . But I would say digital technology probably does n't have much impact on us so far . We 've seen photographs of people from when they are alive . We see home movies . We have videotapes now and e-mails . When it 's going to get interesting is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ online personas ) . You could actually create an avatar that 's semi-autonomous . It could do things for you while you get off the game to run the rest of your life . I think it is just a matter of time before we have literal ghosts in the machine so you can create an alter ego of yourself that learns from your social experiences and extends a life even if you 're no longer in the game or you are no longer alive . <p> Q : Does this lead us to rethink privacy and how we protect it ? <p> A : The privacy debate is poignant given what the National Security Agency has been doing ( referring to the controversy over warrantless surveillance President Bush authorized ) . Most people do n't realize that our Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Communications Commission have all mandated that cell phones need to have position recording built in . They want to be able to pinpoint your location with a global positioning chip in your phone or some other way of identifying your location . This costs the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Feds is that we 'll implement it , but then we get the right to use this for commercial purposes . You will get location-based marketing . People do n't realize but their cell phone will become their personal billboard . We do need to rethink privacy . I think we need to fall back on ( former Supreme Court Justice ) Felix Frankfurter 's definition of privacy which is , " Privacy is the right to be left alone . " <p> Q : What else does technology force us to rethink ? <p> A : Digital technology is the solvent leaching the glue out of all of our traditional institutions . <p> Q : You call yourself an optimist , but some of your forecasts are dark . <p> A : There is reason to be scared . Look at what has happened with fundamentalism  --  this is a reaction against modernity . It happens to be cloaked in religion , but these are people saying enough is enough . It 's happened again and again through history . The good news is that modernism has always won @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentalism is going to burn itself . I am an optimist that we 're going to come out on the other side in pretty good shape , with a much more humane view of technology , and maybe for the first time in a while the middle will win and the two extremes will fail . <p> Q : Are we in control of technology or is technology in control of us ? <p> A : So far , at least , the technology is not autonomous to be in charge . That will be the worry for people 20 to 40 years from now . It is people who are in control . The main lesson is that we invent our technologies and then we turn around and use our technologies to reinvent ourselves as individuals , communities and cultures . We 're right in the middle of that now . Take cyberspace as an example . We had this wonderful utopian vision of a new home for the mind . What we 've reaped is n't cyberspace . It 's cyberbia . It 's this vast , bland wasteland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starlets . But despite all the uncertainty , has there ever been a more fascinating moment to be alive ? <p> ON TECHNOLOGY AND THE HUMAN CONDITION : Sometimes I think we 're on this world for three reasons : to be useful , to tell each other stories and to collect stuff . <p> ON HOW THE INTERNET CHANGES EVERYTHING : Digital technology is the solvent leaching the glue out of all of our traditional institutions . <p> ON PRIVACY AND INFORMATION OVERLOAD : The curse of cyberspace is that everything we want to preserve will get lost and everything we want to lose will be preserved . <p> BRIEFCASE <p> Name : Paul Saffo <p> Organizations : Institute for the Future and Stanford University School of Engineering <p> Jobs : Forecaster and consulting associate professor <p> Age : 51 <p> Education : Bachelor of arts , Harvard College , 1976 ; bachelor of laws , Cambridge University , 1980 ; doctor of jurisprudence , Stanford University , 1980 <p> Work experience : Forecaster for the Institute for the Future in Menlo Park since 1985 ; currently teaching a class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writer <p> Web site : www.saffo.com <p> Beyond the boardroom <p> What 's your favorite hobby ?
