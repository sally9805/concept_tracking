In the fifth year of Khufu , the Golden Horus , Great in victories , Chosen of Ra , as the pyramid rose in the desert like a burning torch to the sun god himself , I realized my mistake and knew that I had brought disorder . <p> " Foolishness ! " Khons slapped a stone-roughened hand on the papyri unrolled on the basalt-black slab before us , and turned his back on the well-ordered charts to study the workforce on the plateau . <p> I refused to follow his gaze . Behind me , I knew , eight thousand men toiled , dragging quarry stones up ramps that snaked around my half-finished pyramid , and levering them into beautiful precision . Below them , intersecting lines of men advanced with the rhythm of drumbeats . They worked quickly but never fast enough . <p> My voice took on a hard edge . " Perhaps , Khons , if you spent more time listening and less blustering- " <p> " You speak to me of time ? " The overseer of quarries whirled to face me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's flank when a fly irritates . " Do you have any idea what these changes mean ? " He waved a hand over my plans . " You were a naked baboon at Neferma'at 's knee when he and I were building the pyramids at Saqqara ! " <p> This insult was well-worn , and I was sick of it . I stepped up to him , close enough to map every vein in his forehead . The desert air between us stilled with the tension . " You forget yourself , Khons . I may not be your elder , but I am grand vizier . " <p> " My good men , " Ded'e interrupted , his voice dripping honey as he smoothed long fingers over the soft papyrus . " Let us not quarrel like harem women over a simple change of design . " <p> " Simple ! " Khons snorted . " Perhaps for you . Your farmers and bakers care not where Pharaoh 's burial chamber is located . But I will need to rework all the numbers for the Giza quarry . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Khons turned on me . " The plans for the queen 's pyramid are later than grain in a drought year . A project of this magnitude must run like marble over the rollers . A change like this-you 're hurling a chunk of limestone into the Nile , and there will be ripples . Other deadlines will be missed- " <p> I held up a hand and waited to respond . I preferred to handle Khons and his fits of metaphor by giving us both time to cool . The sun hammered down on the building site , and I looked away , past the sands of death , toward the life-giving harbor and the fertile plain beyond . This year 's Inundation had not yet crested , but already the Nile 's green waters had swelled to the border of last year 's floodplain . When the waters receded in three months , leaving behind their rich silt deposits , the land would be black and fertile and planting would commence . <p> " Three months , " I said . In three months , most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ till , leaving my pyramid unfinished , dependent on me to make it whole . <p> Khons grunted . " Exactly . No time for changes . " <p> Ded'e scanned the plateau , his fingers skimming his forehead to block the glare , though he had applied a careful line of kohl beneath his eyes today . " Where is Mentu ? Did you not send a message , Hemiunu ? " <p> I looked toward the workmen 's village , too far to make out anyone approaching by the road . Mentu-hotep also served as one of my chief overseers . These three answered directly to me , and under them commanded fifty supervisors , who in turn organized the twelve-thousand-man force . Nothing of this scale had ever been undertaken in the history of the Two Lands . In the history of man . We were building the Great Pyramid , the Horizon of the Pharaoh Khufu . A thousand years , nay , ten thousand years from now , my pyramid would still stand . And though a tomb for Pharaoh , it would also bear my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thinks he can do as he wishes , " Khons said . <p> I ignored his petty implication that I played favorites among my staff . " Perhaps he is slow in getting started today . " I jabbed a finger at the plans again . " Look , Khons , the burial chamber 's relocation will mean that the inner core will require less stone , not more . I 've redesigned the plans to show the king 's chamber beginning on Course Fifty . Between the corbelled ascending corridor , the burial chamber , five courses high , and the five relieving chambers that will be necessary above it , we will save 8,242 blocks . " <p> " Exactly 8,242 ? Are you certain ? " De'de snorted . " I think you must stay up all night solving equations , eh , Hemi ? " <p> I inclined my head to the pyramid , now one-fourth its finished height . " Look at it , De'de . See the way the sides angle at a setback of exactly 11:14 . Look at the platform , level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finger . " I turned on him . " Do you think such beauty happens by chance ? No , it requires constant attention from one who would rather lose sleep than see it falter . " <p> " It 's blasphemy . " Khons 's voice was low . It was unwise to speak thus of the Favored One . <p> I exhaled and we hung over the plans , heads together . Khons smelled of sweat and dust , and sand caked the outer rim of his ear . " It is for the best , Khons . You will see . " <p> If blasphemy were involved , it was my doing and not Khufu 's . I had engineered the raising of the burial chamber above ground and , along with it , Khufu 's role as the earthly incarnation of the god Ra . It was for the good of Egypt , and now it must be carried forward . Hesitation , indecision-these were for weak men . <p> " Let the priests argue about religious matters , " I said . " I am a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are like the pyramid , Hemi . All sharp angles and unforgiving measurements . " <p> I blinked at the observation , then smiled as though it pleased me . <p> Khons opened his mouth , no doubt to argue , but a shout from the work site stopped him . We three turned to the pyramid , and I ground my teeth to see the work gangs falter in their measured march up the ramps . Some disorder near the top drew the attention of all . I squinted against the bright blue sky but saw only the brown figures of the workforce covering the stone . <p> " Cursed Mentu . Where is he ? " Khons asked the question this time . <p> As overseer for operations , Mentu took charge of problems on the line . In his absence , I now stalked toward the site . <p> The Green Sea Gang had halted on the east-face ramp , their draglines still braced over their bare shoulders . Even from thirty cubits below I could see the ropy muscles stand out on the backs of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attached to the line . Their white skirts of this morning had long since tanned with dust , and their skin shone with afternoon sweat . <p> " Sokkwi ! Get your men moving forward ! " I shouted to the Green Sea Gang supervisor who should have been at the top . <p> There was no reply , so I strode up the ramp myself , multiplying in my mind the minutes of delay by the stones not raised . The workday might need extending . <p> Halfway up the first rubble ramp , a scream like that of an antelope skewered by a hunter 's arrow ripped the air . I paused only a moment , the men 's eyes on me , then took to the rope-lashed ladder that leaned against the pyramid 's side . I felt the acacia wood strain under the pounding of my feet and slowed only enough for safety . The ladder stretched to the next circuit of the ramp , and I scrambled from it , chest heaving , and sprinted through the double line of laborers that snaked around the final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Still so much to build . <p> Sokkwi , the gang supervisor , had his back to me when I reached the top . Several others clustered around him , bent to something on the stone . Chisels and drills lay scattered about . <p> " What is it ? What 's happened ? " The dry heat had stolen my breath , and the words panted out . <p> They broke apart to reveal a laborer , no more than eighteen years , on the ground , one leg pinned by a block half set in place . The boy 's eyes locked onto mine , as if to beg for mercy . " Move the stone ! " I shouted to Sokkwi . <p> He scratched his chin . " It 's no good . The stone 's been dropped . We have nothing to- " <p> I jumped into the space open for the next stone , gripped the rising joint of the block that pinned the boy and yelled to a worker , larger than most . " You there ! Help me slide this stone ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stone . We strained against it like locusts pushing against a mountain . Sokkwi laid a hand upon my shoulder . <p> I rested a moment , and he inclined his head to the boy 's leg . Flesh had been torn down to muscle and bone . I reached for something to steady myself , but there was nothing at this height . The sight of blood , a weakness I had known since my youth , threatened to overcome me . I felt a warmth in my face and neck . I breathed slowly through my nose . No good for the men to see you swoon . <p> I knelt and placed a hand on the boy 's head , then spoke to Sokkwi . " How did this happen ? " <p> He shrugged . " First time on the line . " He worked at something in his teeth with his tongue . " Does n't know the angles , I suppose . " Another shrug . <p> " What was he doing at the top then ? " I searched the work area and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stomach . <p> The supervisor sighed and picked at his teeth with a fingernail . " Do n't ask me . I make sure the blocks climb those ramps and settle into place . That is all I do . " <p> How had Mentu allowed this disaster ? Justice , truth , and divine order-the ma'at - made Egypt great and made a man great . I did not like to see ma'at disturbed . <p> On the ramp a woman pushed past the workers , shoving them aside in her haste to reach the top . She gained the flat area where we stood and paused , her breath huffing out in dry gasps . In her hands she held two jars , brimming with enough barley beer to allow the boy to feel fierce anger rather than beg for his own death . The surgeon came behind , readying his saw . The boy had a chance at life if the leg ended in a stump . Allowed to fester , the injury would surely kill him . <p> I masked my faintness with my anger and spun away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lines below me , down into the desert below , perhaps to the quarry beyond . He should never have allowed such an inexperienced boy to place stones . Where had he been this morning when the gangs formed teams ? <p> The men nearby were silent , but the work down on the plateau continued , heedless of the boy 's pain . The rhythmic ring of chisel on quarry stone punctuated the collective grunts of the quarry men , their chorus drifting across the desert , but Mentu did not answer the call . <p> Was he still in his bed ? Mentu and I had spent last evening pouring wine and reminiscing late into the night about the days of our youth . Some of them anyway . Always one story never retold . <p> Another scream behind me . That woman had best get to pouring the barley beer . I could do nothing more here . I moved through the line of men , noting their nods of approval for the effort I 'd made on behalf of one of their own . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basalt-black stone where I conferred with Khons and Ded'e , I saw that another had joined them . My brother . <p> I slowed my steps to allow that part of my heart to harden like mud bricks in the sun , then pushed forward . <p> They laughed together as I approached , the easy laugh of men comfortable with one another . My older brother leaned against the stone , his arms crossed in front of him . He stood upright when he saw me . <p> " Ahmose , " I said with a slight nod . " What brings you to the site ? " <p> His smile turned to a smirk . " Just wanted to see how the project proceeds . " <p> " Hmm . " I focused my attention once more on the plans . The wind grabbed at the edges of the papyrus , and I used a stone cubit rod , thicker than my thumb , to weight it . " The three of us must recalculate stone transfer rates- " <p> " Khons seems to believe your changes are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled , his perfect teeth gleaming against his dark skin . <p> The gods had favored Ahmose with beauty , charm , and a pleasing manner that made him well loved among the court . But I had been blessed with a strong mind and a stronger will . And I was grand vizier . <p> I lifted my eyes once more to the pyramid rising in perfect symmetry against the blue sky , and the thousands of men at my command . " The Horizon of Khufu will look down upon your children 's grandchildren , Ahmose , " I said . I leaned over my charts and braced my fingertips on the stone . " When you have long since sailed to the west , still it will stand . " <p> He bent beside me , his breath in my ear . " You always did believe you could do anything . Get away with anything . " <p> The animosity in his voice stiffened my shoulders . <p> " Khons , Ded'e , if you will . " I gestured to the charts . Khons snorted and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the papyrus . <p> " It must be gratifying , " Ahmose whispered , " to command men so much more experienced than yourself . " <p> I turned on him , my smile tight . " And it must be disheartening to see your younger brother excel while you languish in a job bestowed only out of pity- " <p> A boy appeared , sparing me the indignity of exchanging blows with my brother . His sidelock identified him as a young prince , and I recognized him as the youngest of Henutsen , one of Khufu 's lesser wives . <p> " His Majesty Khufu , the king , Horus , " the boy said , " the strong bull , beloved by the goddess of truth- " <p> " Yes , yes . Life , Health , Strength ! " I barked . " What does Khufu want ? " I was in no mood for the string of titles . <p> The boy 's eyes widened and he dragged a foot through the sand . " My father commands the immediate presence of Grand vizier Hemiunu @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reason ? " <p> The prince pulled on his lower lip . " He is very angry today . " <p> " Very well . " I waved him off and turned to Khons and Ded'e , rubbing the tension from my forehead . " We will continue later . " <p> The two overseers made their escape before Ahmose and I had a chance to go at it again . I flicked a glance in his direction , then rolled up my charts , keeping my breathing even . <p> Behind me Ahmose said , " Perhaps Khufu has finally seen his error in appointing you vizier . " Like a sharp poke in the kidneys when our mother was n't watching . <p> " Excuse me , Ahmose . " I pushed past him , my hands full of charts . " I have an important meeting . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
