Section : Priority What a former cookie-shop owner knows about entrepreneurship <p> ONE NIGHT IN 2000 , Sen. John Kerry invited 15 Massachusetts technology entrepreneurs over for dinner . Arriving late , Paul Egerman , a veteran of tech start-ups , was n't able to find a parking space and pulled into a dubious spot in front of his host 's Beacon Hill mansion . The senator greeted him at the door with a parking pass , then asked for a favor in return . " He gave me a piece of bond paper with just his name and asked me to give him an autograph , " Egerman recalls . " I felt stupid . " But he signed  --  and then took a second to process what he 'd just learned : John Kerry collects entrepreneurs ' autographs . <p> Those who assume that a liberal senator from Massachusetts would rather collect the autographs of tax collectors might be even more surprised . Like most Democratic senators , Kerry routinely receives poor ratings from the tax-cut-obsessed National Federation of Independent Business . The group , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the minimum wage , the estate tax , and almost everything else . Tapping a trial lawyer as his running mate did nothing to boost Kerry 's image at NFIB . <p> And yet , in two decades in the Senate , Kerry has put together a distinct agenda with respect to entrepreneurship , one informed by his own experiences as a business owner and his roots in one of the nation 's most innovative , growth-oriented state economies . " A lot of political folk , especially Democrats , did n't used to get the private sector , " says John Moriarty , a former lobbyist and longtime Kerry ally . " But he understands the value of it , of rewarding results based on merit . " Still , Kerry has work to do . An informal survey of Inc. 500 CEOs , for example , shows Kerry winning the support of only 16% to Bush 's 57% . They may recall that in 2000 , Al Gore , despite a long history as an enthusiast of technological innovation , came to be perceived as an opponent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ versus the powerful . " <p> The Kerry camp would argue that their man has some of the best Main Street business credentials since Truman . In 1976 , Kerry and his friend K. Dun Gifford opened a cookie business in Boston under their mothers ' maiden names , Kilvert &; Forbes . It was intended to sound , Gifford says , like " a pretty snooty upscale company . " <p> Though Kerry also had a law practice at the time , Gifford says his partner proved to be a hands-on operator , reviewing sales data daily . They started with two types of cookies based on family recipes , selling for $1.25 each because of costly ingredients . Kerry insisted on the Lindt chocolate he remembered from his Swiss boarding-school days and the same butter used in traditional croissants . <p> Political ambitions cut short Kerry 's cookie-mogul dreams ; when he ran for office in 1982 , he bought out Gifford , then sold the business . " I could 've been Mrs. Fields ; ' he joked with reporters in May , but " I thought it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the Senate , Kerry volunteered to serve on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship , even though it is widely seen as a backwater . At first , many thought it an effort to move out of the considerable shadow of his state 's senior senator , Edward Kennedy . Both Democrats and Republicans have since credited Kerry with helping to expand the committee 's range as its ranking Democrat and , for two years , its chairman . He has not spent as much time as Republicans lamenting the burden of taxes and environmental and labor regulations , but he has proposed tax-simplification and regulatory-assistance programs designed to make it easier for small businesses to comply . <p> Although pro-business activism does not always square with fealty to Democratic interest groups , Kerry has at times managed to balance the two , sponsoring legislation to encourage individual investment : tax breaks on long-term gains from small-business stock , and an expanded capital-gains exclusion for small-cap companies . He has also pushed programs designed to benefit businesses in disadvantaged urban and rural areas , subtly challenging the logic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Kerry has used his Beacon Hill dinners to keep in touch with local health care , software , and venture-capital communities . " He 's a man of Massachusetts , ' says Moriarty . " The tech industry has been economically important for most of his adult life . Enabling everyday high-tech start-ups is small business . " These days , the state 's economy is defined more by the tech-heavy Route 128 corridor than by Cape Cod docks or Boston banks ; growth has come in the form of small companies , frequently founded out of universities and research labs . " He gets that it 's an incubator economy , " Moriarty says . <p> As a presidential candidate , Kerry has proposed the types of initiatives that would likely play well at those entrepreneurial dinners , even if they do n't excite the NFIB . The centerpiece is a national " small-business opportunity fund , " with a focus on loans to micro-enterprises and a promise to increase federal venture capital investments . He now suggests scrapping capital-gains taxes on new long-term investment in small businesses and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In sum , Kerry 's platform In sum , Kerry 's emphasizes access-to-capital issues over payroll concerns like taxes and health care costs ( although Kerry has proposals dealing with those subjects , too ) . " There 's a clear policy distinction between looking at small business as a large mess of small interests and looking at a segment of fast-growing gazelles , the real engine of the U.S economy , " says the Democratic Leadership Council 's Rob Atkinson , who has advised Kerry . " That is what Kerry has done differently from the more traditional Democratic approach and actually from the Republican approach . " <p> While Kerry may never become Mrs. Fields  --  although his personal record as a business-man compares favorably with George W. Bush 's  --  his ultimate success as an entrepreneur might be in redefining the Democratic Party around a cutting-edge pro-business agenda . " Why would a guy go start a cookie company ? " asks Moriarty . " He gets the sheer fun of building and creating something that becomes viable . He 's got the soul of an entrepreneur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in San Jose , Calif . <p> By Sasha Issenberg <p>
