from Seven Mediterraneans The dreamer had heard what she thought was a rumor about someone she did n't know wanting to have sex with her . This after several months of trying to have sex with Janine , who was in the painting group  --  they all took turns posing for gesture drawings  --  right before the weather changed to rain along the coast . This would have been the early 1970 's , when the dreamer could , on her toes , see the ocean as she walked down the gravel path from the redwood house , if the fog was n't in . Had she become more time entrepreneur , and not the beachcomber , or messenger , or whatever , she might 've stayed to buy that which would eventually obstruct the view . But possession on that order was never her passion . <p> She lived with two guys in those days , one of whom she was " with . " She was always setting out , it seemed , down the path which , if she went left , headed along an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this was one of the first years in which that word had any import  --  alone in the early hours . Later , when Litzi moved in and Billy moved out , she jogged with Litzi 's two dogs , Babe and Haile . After Babe died , Litzi got another Rhodesian ridgeback , Flora , who saved the dreamer 's life every day by licking her face , so she would go out on a run with her ( it would be " running " by then ) , but this was years later , at the house Litzi built in Spain , and let her use  --  she 'd be much more the adventurer by then  --  for arduous metaphysical quests , and others admittedly less active , if no less tortured . Although by no means a torture such as the Spanish heretics endured under the Catholic tribunals , it had , coincidentally , anguished cries of Damn it ! and Have mercy ! But these must be hushed for now . <p> Billy told the dreamer that this woman he knew wanted to sleep with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be interested . He came home very excited and said to call her and do it . So the dreamer called her , although she did n't believe she had actually said this to him ; she thought perhaps someone had told someone who had told him . She was not flattered at all because she did n't take it personally . She 'd simply wanted to have sex  --  the dreamer found out later , for the first time  --  with a woman . As a dreamer , she had plenty of time to hang out in bars , where a live band played . The band consisted of two people and a cheap guitar . There she would sit , dreaming a singer who would make a stone weep . Looking everywhere for such a voice , the dreamer made the call . <p> She sounded cheerful and laconic . The dreamer asked herself over . They planned something for the next day , and the next day she walked over . The sun was just breaking through the fog . She was buoyant , walking on a curve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretch of redwood trees . To say that the air was perfumed would be to give too much of a French , sweet accent . But there was a scent on the air , of redwood smoke , of eucalyptus leaves , a faint breath of salt , and the last flowers of autumn , the scentless but humid trilliums one was never to pick . They would never grow back , that would be it . <p> As soon as she got there , she wanted to know if the dreamer wanted to take a bath . She led into the bathroom and immediately undressed ( different from taking off her clothes ) , one piece at a time , stopping , then continuing down her body and , finally , out of her sandals . Leaving her own clothes in a pile , stepping on them , the dreamer got in , facing her . They kissed wetly , over and over , as they sat there , in no way reminding each of the other . <p> She kept on her rings and silver bracelets , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soapy sponge , on an insignificant afternoon among days which held the heat for an hour before turning cool and foggy again . She made it seem like they had known each other a while . She washed her , sexually , slowly , and dropped the sponge , and let her touch her , and then came when the dreamer came , and cried , laughing . The dreamer wondered if , among her other encounters , with men , this woman was as naturally generous . She had simply decided to have sex , once only , without making it seem terribly impersonal . The humid bath water , like the air outside , and jasmine soap , so much like her perfume around her neck , and her softness , so much like a child 's : welcome . <p> The dreamer was stunned when she came , not because she had come with a woman , but because she woke from a dream . She heard her light laughter in the outside world . So they got out of the tub . They saw each other one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a floral dress , and the coral and silver bracelets , many of them . The dreamer saw her first and looked at her for a minute . Everything was in regular time , the time it took her to cross , and then she saw the dreamer and looked happily past . She blew a kiss at the dreamer , opening her mouth to start it , never touching her hand to her lips , but nearly , so as to stop shy of her nose with her straight fingers , and not grazing her nose , and moving her hand swiftly , but not indifferently . Simply moving . <p> Walking home from her house that one afternoon , the dreamer could describe the wind which , in fact , had picked up and was slicing into the air with a ragged edge , and say it began to rain , as it did in that region , as a mist , but that 's not true . When she left the house , it seemed no later in the day , judging by the uniformly cloudy light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer cared to infer one thing from another . She walked slowly , empty-handed because she had n't taken her keys or money . The thing was n't of this world as she knew it . <p> She finally slept with Janine . It was too bad , because what could have been a long friendship ended , and just when Janine was leaving town soon anyway . Billy was in the house , so it must have been awkward for her . It was a small , hand-built redwood house , two open floors , and Billy 's room was very small , such that he always hung out in the living room , right under the big bedroom . There was a small window behind the bed . To think of it now , the resinous , saturated air must have been nearly suffocating . People in that town would go home and , if the moon broke through the clouds , write poems about moon-breasts and read them at poetry readings with a bass player and a snare drummer  --  the bass player must be somebody now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group over , and Janine stayed afterwards . She loved to model for the group as a part of each taking turns holding a series of poses quickly , while the rest worked in charcoal or pastel . Eventually she did a series of fat ladies in chairs , big oils , which was kind of a joke since several members , especially Harriet , were skinny . She worked from the gesture drawings , except that she had the chairs around the house and painted them from lift . <p> On one glass of wine , the dreamer ca n't imagine how , after they kiss , Janine agrees to come upstairs . She thinks perhaps Janine has stayed over because they 'd had a good drawing session , everyone talking at once , about love and sex . Janine talked about her French grandmother who 'd taught her to make jam ; Janine would take the dreamer to collect blackberries up on the headland and cover their faces in the juices while they cooked . One afternoon , the dreamer fill in love with her , even though Janine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Janine taught the dreamer how to stand over a blowhole where the ocean met the rocks , and not fall in . She had a lot of guys in love with her , and one of them used to swim in the butt-cold water while they would pace along the shore . She slept with a tot of guys . The dreamer knew all about them . One of them is a famous journalist now , he writes about the uprisings in southern Mexico . The dreamer could never understand how Janine could sleep with him because he never washed . He thought he was a beat poet . The dreamer was too much the dreamer to get that Janine liked him . Sometimes the dreamer would drop by just as he was leaving Janine 's place , a crummy apartment right near the ocean , and they 'd be really happy to see her , like she was their kid or something . <p> When they did make love they stayed up all night and very casually made love many times . The dreamer remembers thinking this made her her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward her , she was as warm as ever , and entirely uninvolved , until the dreamer gave up . The dreamer gave up painting around the same time , for reasons unrelated . The idyll simply ended . <p> Yet this Edenic place existed , where people smoked pot , grew acres of it unimpeded , and ate the fresh abalone and salmon poor artists should never see . The crab would fall apart on the two-mile ride home , and the salmon drip blood-orange , color right out of a painting . Janine and the dreamer would eat down by the dock a lot . Janine talked about Louie , one of her friends . Maybe he had a hard time of it later ; he was just starting to wear dresses then . The dreamer always ended up on Janine 's couch in her office . Her mother has a picture in her living room from those days , probably with the sweetest smile the dreamer ever had . She thought for sure she was going to kiss Janine all afternoon . <p> Janine never liked her belly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wandering eye , which never stopped her from attracting some of the best-looking guys . Everyone slogged around town in rubber boots , hats , wool jackets , and salty jeans . Janine smelled of lavender , because of how much she said about her grandmother and French jams and jellies and breads . When Janine started hanging out with Joaquim , the master jeweler  --  which was brief because he had a wife who was very possessive  --  they found themselves introduced to coral and agate . Abalone was so plentiful that people used the shells for ashtrays . Janine and the dreamer would pull mussels off beach rocks and invite friends to the beach and heat pots of water over a fire and pull the beards off of mussels , which came right off the rock , unlike clams , the dreamer went out one dawn with the guy she was living with to clam , and they just stood there and never saw one suck hole . <p> Her endless patience while the dreamer watched Janine cook and garden ! She followed Janine like a dog . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black standard poodle , hurtling through the air . Janine claimed poodles were the smartest dogs , and Monsieur the smartest of all , and indeed , he did have a sixth sense about time , weather , and humans . Janine said he read The New York Times , unlike anyone else in California . She was a snob about France and literature . She knew everything about art and spoke English with a peculiar , lilting rise at the ends of lines of poetry at public gatherings that gave the dreamer a headache . <p> Janine recommended that the dreamer study Henri Matisse , because she said only the French can properly draw , and Janine liked to quote the painter Ingrs , who wrote , " Drawing is the probity of art . " But what does it mean ? It is far less annoying when Janine says that Hokusai is called " the old man mad about drawing . " Slowly , slowly , Janine would say , one studies nature . Janine liked especially to throw Courbet in the dreamer 's face : " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own individuality within a total knowledge of tradition . " So it was going to take years , she could see that . <p> And she could figure out that Matisse did n't paint objects frivolously , but to connect objects and feelings . She would study his notes : " Do n't misunderstand me : I do n't mean that seeing the tree through my window , I work at copying it . The tree is also the sum total of its effects upon me . I have before me an object that affects my mind not only as a tree but also in relation to all sorts of other feelings . " So , it was about life ! That much she could certainly understand . She hardly needed to shut her eyes , and there was Matisse 's tree , the trunk , the leaves , the branch , the branches turning and crossing in front of the trunk , all of it , and she became exhilarated at the thought of her tree , waiting outside companionably , and it exhausted her , too , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then , that a tree is made to look as if ten or twenty leaves are the full thousand ? <p> Janine would lean over her sink , where she could get right at her pots on the windowsill , and yank rosemary out and put it under the dreamer 's nose and cry out about how it was a tree , everything was a tree . And she was right , put there , that way , the search for color came from the outside , from nature , and its expression was personal . <p> <p> By Jane Miller <p>
