<p> For years , Salman Rushdie 's meticulous journals , manuscripts and letters gathered dust in a storage lock-up in London . The famed writer said he never thought about what to do with them . Then , Emory University came calling . <p> So why house the nearly 100 boxes of personal materials at an Atlanta institution to which he had few ties , outside of a one-time visit ? <p> " Because they asked me and nobody else had , " Rushdie said Tuesday . <p> Rushdie , 59 , one of the world 's best-known essayists and writers of contemporary literature , arrived at Emory this week for a four-week stay , part of his five-year appointment as distinguished writer in residence . While at Emory , he will teach a weekly literature seminar for graduate students and host a public lecture later this month . <p> Rushdie 's archives are being cataloged and will likely open to scholars in the next year . Emory has declined to release financial details of the arrangement . <p> Rushdie said Emory 's commitment to building a serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poet Laureate Ted Hughes and Nobel Laureate Seamus Heany  --  helped him make his decision . <p> In addition to hundreds of personal letters , drafts of his books , and four computers containing his e-mail , the archive includes nearly 1,600 pages of typescript for his 1988 novel , " The Satanic Verses . " <p> Rushdie spoke on campus on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the Ayatollah Khomeini 's infamous call for the writer 's execution for allegedly blaspheming Islam in the book . <p> Rushdie spent 10 years in hiding before the Iranian government announced it would no longer obey the edict or encourage others to do so . <p> While Rushdie likened the opening of his own archive to the feeling of " undressing in public , " the British-Indian writer said he is looking forward to the chance to " rummage around in my past . " <p> " I found two short stories I 'd completely forgotten I 'd written , " Rushdie said . <p> He said he has no plans to make other extended commitments to other universities . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to guard your time or otherwise you do n't have a chance to write . " <p> Rushdie first visited Emory in 2004 as a headliner in a literature lecture series . While on campus , President James Wagner first proposed the idea of an extended relationship and of housing his archives , he said . <p> " I could n't be more pleased that this has worked out , " Rushdie said . <p> Stephen Enniss , director of Emory 's Manuscript , Archives and Rare Book Library , called the journals and archival papers a road map to Rushdie 's highly complex novels . <p> " This archive offers unprecedented access to his own private thoughts , " Enniss said . " He is one of the masters of his generation and will be studied for centuries . " <p> In between scribbled phone numbers or to-do lists are intimate descriptions of Rushdie 's life . <p> " When , if ever I finish " The Satanic Verses , " in spite of emotional upheavals , divorce , house move , Nicaragua book , India film , death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al , I will , I feel , have completed my ' List business ' that of naming the parts of myself , " he wrote in one journal . " Then there will be nothing left to write about ; except , of course , the whole of human life . " <p> Rushdie said he plans to use his journals from 1989 on , which have not yet been opened to Emory , to write a memoir about his life in hiding . <p> " Until I do that , they 're mine , " he said . <p> Rushdie will teach 17 graduate students in his weekly seminar . The students sent in applications to the English department describing how his class would help their research . <p> Emory officials would not disclose details of security on campus for Rushdie . <p> On Tuesday , Rushdie said he rarely thinks about his safety . <p> " It 's reached a point where it is a piece of rhetoric , not a real threat , " he said . " It 's been a long time since it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year Iranian clerics renew the call for his execution in what Rushdie calls a " Valentine 's Day card from Iran . " <p> Stephen Blackwood , 31 , a graduate student in religion , said he is studying the relationship between poetry and prose . Rushdie 's work , he said , " comes from a muse that is friendly with poetry . I thought reading the prose he selected himself might give me a glimpse into the nature of the kind of muse I 'm thinking about in my own research . It will be a privilege just to sit and listen . " <p> Rushdie 's collection is the latest in a long line of major acquisitions for the university . Emory purchased the Hughes archives in 1997 and a major portion of the Heaney 's archives in 2003 . <p> In 2004 , Emory again made headlines when it received the 60,000-volume Raymond Danowski poetry collection . Last month , the university announced it had acquired the letters Hughes wrote to his lover , Assia Wevill . <p> ABOUT SALMAN RUSHDIE <p> * In 1981 , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Booker Prize , one of the world 's most prestigious literary prizes . <p> * " The Satanic Verses , " published in 1988 , caused a firestorm in parts of the Islamic world .
