Until recently , voice-recognition features on cell phones had only limited use . You recorded a name and later , if you said it exactly the way you did the first time , the phone might make the call . Now a new class of phones is speaker independent : anyone can say a name and , in theory , the phone will call . Sprint PCS sells three such phones  --  the Samsung A600 ( $350 ) , VGA1000 ( $260 ) and new VI660 ( $230 ) . Verizon Wireless introduced similar voice recognition last fall in the Samsung i600 Smartphone ( $500 ) and this week follows it up with the VX4500 from LG ( $120 ) . We programmed the four new models with identical phone books . The three Samsungs immediately displayed a knack for recognition . Hard consonants and names with several syllables seemed to be easy for all , but the LG alone struggled with short words like Dad or Jenn , both of which it mistook for Deanna .  --  By Wilson Rothman        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
