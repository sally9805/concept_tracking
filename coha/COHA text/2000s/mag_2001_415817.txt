More and more young women are getting high-and hooked-on legal drugs . We investigate this scary trend . Photograph Household pills can be harmful , // * After Sabrina Smith* , 25 , was in a minor car accident last spring , the aching in her lower back caused her to toss and turn at night . Her doctor prescribed OxyContin to ease the pain . It did do that and more-it made her feel pleasantly buzzed , and the more she took , the better she felt . Within days , she was doubling her dosage , then quadrupling it . Soon , she had convinced three doctors to write her prescriptions . " I had never touched any drugs before then , " she says . " I thought people used OxyContin all the time without any problem . " But by fall , she had to check in to a rehab center to wean herself off the pills . Like Sabrina , most people believe that prescription drugs are perfectly safe  --  after all , they 're approved by the Food and Drug Administration . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taking these legal concoctions recreationally  --  in larger doses than they should and often when they do n't suffer from the conditions the drug is meant to treat . The three most commonly abused types of prescription drugs are painkillers , like OxyContin , which affect the brain areas related to pleasure ; stimulants , which make you more alert and energetic ; and sedatives , which relax you by slowing normal brain function . " Prescription-drug abuse is definitely on the rise , " says Alan Leshner , Ph.D. , of the National Institutes of Health . What 's more problematic is that all of these drugs are habit-forming . Like Sabrina , many women start taking pills for a legitimate reason , then build up a tolerance and get hooked . Addicts often resort to buying their drugs off the street or , more rarely , forging prescriptions . ( Both practices are illegal . ) " Addiction becomes an overpowering motivator .

" We started taking them , and at first it felt great , " says Elizabeth . " But after about a week , I had to take them just to get out of bed and feel normal . " First introduced on the market in 1995 , OxyContin abuse has been spreading like wildfire . Its active ingredient is a synthetic form of morphine called oxycodone ; the tablets have a time-release coating and are supposed to be used by people with chronic or severe pain . Recreational users often smash the tablets , then snort or inject them for a quicker buzz , a practice that can easily lead to a fatal overdose .

At the Life Center of Galax , a rehab program in Virginia , clinic workers are struggling to keep up with the number of OxyContin abusers . " Even after two or three days of withdrawal , which feels like the worst case of the flu ever , they still go back to using again , " says Emily Jennings , a director at the clinic . Elizabeth , who began Galax 's outpatient treatment program last year , has felt the power of the drug firsthand . " Once you get hooked on Oxies , you hate them , but you have to have them , " she says . Elizabeth 's need was so great that she even started going out with a drug dealer so she could get OxyContin for free . At Galax , Elizabeth was put on methadone , which blocks the pleasurable effects of drugs .

" Sometimes , when I have to work a long shift and ca n't keep my eyes open , I run to the bathroom and down one pill . It kicks right in , and I 'm 100 percent focused for the rest of the day , even until midnight . " College students cramming for an exam , professionals preparing for a presentation , and even actresses who need to learn their lines quickly are turning to Ritalin . They can get it easily by telling doctors or psychiatrists that they 're having problems paying attention . Some women even chop the tablets into powder and snort it for a quicker performance-enhancing effect . Experts say that kind of abuse is dangerous .

Hallowell , M.D. , author of Driven to Distraction . the sleep seducer Women are discovering all sorts of effects from even the most benign-seeming drugs , like Ambien , the newest sleeping pill on the market . " I took my Ambien one night for its regular purpose , " says Michelle , a 27-year-old antiques dealer who was prescribed the drug for insomnia . " I was stressed and freaking and could n't sleep . I started reading a book when I realized that if I made an effort to stay awake before letting the Ambien take over , it was like being drunk with no side effects .

" I had a whole telephone courtship with my boyfriend while I was high on Ambien , and I do n't even remember what I told him , " says Becca , 27 , who was mildly depressed and began using Ambien to cope . " Now I wonder whether he fell in love with me or the drug . " Becca ended up taking Ambien for six months-including during the day-before she realized what it was doing to her . She stopped taking the drug and went to counseling to help her deal with her depression . " It was as if I was trying to sleep through life , " she says .
