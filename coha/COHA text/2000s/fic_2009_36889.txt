MAMORU <br> <br> On the seventh and final day of mourning for the loss of the war , my brother Iseul came to my chambers to tell me that our father was dead . <br> I had been expecting the news for some time . There was ritual ensconced in the hour of his death  --  this , on the seventh hour of the seventh day  --  which made it all the more unsurprising to see the truth in my brother 's eyes , lining his mouth and hardening his jaw . The news was no shock to us . Our father had taken his life in apology for our defeat at the hands of the Volstovics , as we always knew he would ; all we could do now was join him or suffer his legacy . For either of these , we were equally prepared . <br> My brother came with black robes and no kohl to line his eyes , rather than with knives of ceremony . I saw then that his decision had been made . In this as in all things , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> Outside the window , just past the quiet gardens of raked sand and contemplation , loomed the broken roof of the magicians ' dome , like the rounded edge of a broken sky as seen from above , where the gods once sat and watched over us in dominion . It was far enough away that it looked almost like a shattered bowl overset , or a forsaken cup of tea dropped by clumsy hands . What remained of the dome was charred . Here and there the blue stone sparkled , but it was no more than feeble protest in the bleaching sunlight . <br> The destruction of the dome had been a particularly crushing blow to our people , though perhaps not the one the Volstovics intended . We were not a society based heavily on magic ; war had forced our hand in advancing the skill of our magicians . And though in later years the dome became a perfect gathering place for the magicians , it had first been built as a temple of worship for our gods . Its demolition had been a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ symbol more than a practical structure . <br> Iseul pushed his fingers through his hair , each heavy braid a commendation of his prowess as our father 's general . He was on the verge of pacing , but practice kept him fearsomely still . <br> " The delegation arrives tomorrow , " he said . " We shall meet them as planned . " <br> The entire city must have known by then  --  or would soon know  --  of my father the emperor 's death . From somewhere deep in the green garden just below my window , I heard the sudden throaty wail of a songbird , trembling upon the air . The sound echoed the faint trembling of my brother 's fists , and I averted my eyes . <br> The dew had barely left the leaves . <br> " We 'll meet them as though nothing has changed , " I said , with the hint of a question . <br> Iseul 's eyes flashed in anger . " Nothing has changed , " he insisted . <br> I sank to my knees before him at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Everything had changed . Our father was dead and my brother the emperor in his stead , and I had shown grave disrespect to my new lord by neglecting to bow to him ; shock had overwhelmed all memory of protocol . I struggled with my shame and could not lift my eyes . <br> " Mamoru , " Iseul said , in place of how he had once addressed me . Brother . " Do not do this . Rise . " <br> " I swear to serve you , " I said , instead of obeying him . This old custom was more important even than brotherhood . We were no longer two princes , and I had wasted too much time already without acknowledging his new place as emperor of the Ke Han . " In seven ways I shall serve you . In seven ways I shall offer my life to you . In seven ways , if it is in my power , I shall die beneath your blade , as your blade , for your blade . May your reign be prosperous and long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the words I 'd known since before I could form them with my own mouth , the prayer with which I was born . " May the people love you as I do , " I whispered . " Iseul  --  " <br> My brother held up his hand , fingers spread wide . As always , it was a small sign , but the shame I felt was assuaged by the openness of the gesture . If my brother 's fingers had been all together , I would have sensed his anger at my actions , but I had never given my brother cause to close his hand and his heart against me . <br> " Enough , " he said , his voice cold . He must have already been preparing , mentally , for the arrival of the delegates . " Rise . " <br> I did as he 'd bidden me . It was as things would be between us from then on , and it was as things had always been , for I respected my brother 's elder position just as I loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to know that not everything had changed . <br> " What  --  " I held my tongue , breathing the way I 'd been taught to hide the uncertainty in my voice , my movements . " What happens now , Iseul ? " <br> He shook his head , looking out over the gardens as though expecting to find some answer within their soothing patterns . Of course , my brother was a man who needed no such reassurance . I myself felt an unbidden longing . The sand had no need to worry as to what direction to take , what shape , what form . There was a plan in mind for the sand , and it had only to follow . My brother and I had no such luck . <br> I fiddled with the smooth , soft fabric of my overlong sleeves , trying not to seem as though I was waiting on my brother 's response . Surely the new responsibility was weighing heavily on his mind , and he would have a great many things to discuss with the warlords , our own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The proper thing , I knew , was to beg my leave , expecting to be informed of what my new role within the negotiations would be at a later hour , when my brother had taken his time to sort it out . Knowing this , however , did not preclude my stubborn desire to stay nearby . After all , with our father dead , Iseul was all I had of family , and I the same to him  --  for even as the elder prince , my father had not yet seen fit to find my brother a wife . Now he was emperor , but still my brother , and I would not leave until I 'd found some sign that I 'd not lost him to dark thoughts of what was to come . But he would not look at me . <br> " Iseul , " I began , and felt reassurance opening like a blossom within me . It seemed then that I knew , from some unseen source of certainty , that everything would be healed in time for my brother and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Han . We would put our heads together , Iseul and I , along with my father 's old advisors ; and we would manage the task set to us as best we could . I had n't yet grown past the childish notion that there was nothing we could n't accomplish together . And indeed , even our father had been proud to claim that Iseul 's strengths balanced against mine so fittingly that together we made a nearly invincible pair . Today was going to be onerous for him , and I could not expect reassurances  --  rather it was my place now to reassure him , in his new station , for if I did not support our new emperor with all my being , then what man could be expected to do so ? <br> We would find ourselves within this new rhythm once we 'd settled into this new way of being . It was only a matter of time . <br> My brother 's face turned toward mine , and then to the door as Kouje cleared his throat just beyond , filling the silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " Your pardon , " Iseul said to me , sounding distant somehow , but how could I blame him ? He moved with a steadiness of purpose that I longed to imitate , and slid open the door on the kneeling figure before us . <br> " My lord Emperor , " Kouje began , proving that news traveled faster among the servants than I 'd have believed possible , and that my brother 's decision was known now throughout the great house , if not the palace proper . " Word has been sent that the delegation from Volstov is set to arrive rather  --  earlier  --  than we anticipated . " <br> " Earlier , " my brother repeated . <br> He did not need to phrase it as a question ; it was Kouje 's duty to anticipate and respond in kind . <br> " We believe they may be here in a matter of hours , your Supreme Grace . " <br> It was then that I envied Kouje 's propriety in keeping his face averted . This way , he did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terrible as the gods ' fire . <br> " Gather the warlords , " said my brother , in a voice I did n't recognize . It was a voice that had commanded our warriors in the mountains . " We will hold counsel in the green room . " <br> Kouje rose , clad all in mourning black . The sight of it seemed to remind my brother of something , for he lifted his hand  --  an emperor making his decision . I scarcely had time to marvel at the completeness of my brother 's transformation , as though he 'd been living all his life on its cusp . <br> " Take the prince to be dressed , " Iseul commanded . " The seven days have passed , and the delegation must find us prepared to receive them with all due hospitality . " <br> Kouje bowed , though not so low as to find himself on the floor once more , and turned to me with a waiting expectation I 'd come to know well . <br> " Iseul , " I said . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my silence entirely . It would have been different , in the company of servants , or the other warlords ; but before his death Kouje 's father had served ours as Kouje did me . While he was not of distinguished blood , he was certainly trustworthy  --  too trustworthy , in fact , for he had forgiven me many an error in decorum over the years . I did n't have my brother 's facility in assuming the responsibilities of a prince , nor could I possibly imagine the weight on his shoulders now that he was emperor . Still , we were brothers . I could offer him comfort , if nothing else . " We shall persevere . " <br> We had no other choice beyond that , save to perish in the attempt . But I left unsaid the second half of the old warrior 's idiom , knowing it would only make my brother frown and Kouje regret teaching me such things in the first place . <br> " Go with Kouje , " said my brother . His voice betrayed nothing but an iron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment I was overcome with a sharp awareness of how things were to change between us . " Then . . . return to your chambers . I will send for you . " <br> I bowed low to my brother , the emperor . Despite his remonstrations to the contrary , it never occurred to me to act in any other way . <br> We parted ways without further talk , and I found myself relieved for the silence . My brother never had such troubles as I with keeping his silence or maintaining the peace of his spirit ; I was always at war with myself , my father had once said , and it seemed a quality I might never entirely lose . <br> Kouje , too , said nothing . There were no lamps lit , nor were there servants moving swiftly and surely in preparation . The halls seemed like the winding passageways of a warrior 's tomb . <br> Luckily , there were tasks immediately to hand that would serve as ample distraction from this unfortunate comparison . While Kouje waited just outside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had been drawn for me , holding my breath as I sank deep inside . The water was hot enough that I felt it might scald all my skin from my bones  --  a clean , new birth . <br> I knew with certainty that my brother had been strong enough not to shed a single tear for the father we had both lost  --  and not only our father but our lord emperor as well . He had died the only noble death left for him , and though I mourned the victory for which we had all hoped , I could do nothing more than be a loyal son to him . <br> The bath was swift , and the incense already burning when I stepped out . Servants came to dry me , twisting dry the braids of honor in my hair . This , for the victory at Dragon Bone Pass . This , for the victory of the tunnels . This , for the victory of the forsaken men . This , for the victory of the auspicious moon . <br> I bore no scars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second son . I rode no horse , but did the best I could to keep the men serving me from dying . In the later months of the war , when the fighting had grown too fierce for an unexpected general such as me , the council of warlords had recommended my return to the palace . In place of earning more braids , I had attempted to set up facilities of care for those displaced by the war . It was a necessary task , and I took great pleasure in helping those who 'd been caught living too closely to the Cobalts , but I was no warrior . <br> I imagined that I would always bear the shame of my own shortcomings held against my brother 's fiercer nature were it not for something my father said to me , less than a week before the dragons ' final assault on the capital . <br> " The people 's needs are never so simple as they seem , " he said , taking his favorite seat in the pavilion , built overlooking the koi pond . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could never hope to meet them all at once . My sons will not suffer with such difficulties . Your brother protects what land we have , while you provide for our subjects . Just as we can not provide if the land is taken from us , so the protection becomes meaningless if you squander what gifts may be gleaned from it . " <br> My father had never been one to waste words on meaningless praise . He had never spoken to me thus before , and I sought to memorize his words even as I watched the multicolored fish swarming over and past one another like brightly colored veils , orange and white , blue and gold . <br> I had not returned to the pavilion since the assault on our city , but it bolstered my spirit somewhat to know that the fish would remember our conversation . That though I could no longer ask my father for confirmation of his words , there was some creature left who had been witness to them . <br> Continues ...          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
