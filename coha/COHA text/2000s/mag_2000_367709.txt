Ever since 1906 , when German physician Alois Alzheimer described the degenerative brain disorder that bears his name , doctors have argued about what exactly causes the disease . Dr. Alzheimer carefully noted two main features of the autopsied brains of his patients : the dense clumps , or plaques , of protein that showed up where nerve cells should have been and the tortured tangles that many of the neurons had become . But whether the plaques or the tangles triggered the illness or they were both just the most visible effects of some other , more obscure process no one could say for sure . <P> Now the century-old mystery is on the verge of being solved . As researchers , physicians and caregivers gather in Washington next week for the World Alzheimer Congress , the scientists who favor plaques as the culprit are getting a first crack at proving their hypothesis . Thanks to a series of discoveries  --  some of which have been made only in the past couple of months  --  they should soon be able to demonstrate once and for all whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halting the progression of Alzheimer 's disease . They 've already started preliminary clinical trials in human volunteers of the first anti-Alzheimer 's compounds designed to treat the cause , and not just the symptoms , of the disease . <P> The most straightforward approach to fighting Alzheimer 's plaques is to target their main ingredient , a protein called beta amyloid . Last summer scientists from Elan Pharmaceuticals , a biotech firm located in Ireland , reported that they had developed a vaccine that could shrink the plaques  --  at least in mice . Here the idea is to prime the immune system to treat amyloid proteins just as it would any foreign invader and target them for destruction . The concept is somewhat counterintuitive , since most researchers believe that at least part of the damage in Alzheimer 's disease is caused by the immune system 's overreaction to the presence of plaques and tangles . But the idea was so simple and the animal studies were so encouraging that Elan researchers decided to try it out on people . <P> Initial results of a small safety trial will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If all goes well , Elan will undertake further studies to determine what positive effects , if any , the potential treatment might have on the brain . <P> Another approach , favored by several large pharmaceutical companies , is to try to block the body 's production of amyloid proteins . It turns out that everyone makes beta amyloid throughout his brain and body ( more on that later ) . But people who , for genetic reasons , tend to get Alzheimer 's at an early age  --  in their 40s or 50s  --  seem to shape the protein into a stickier version that is more likely to clump together . By inhibiting an enzyme called gamma secretase , which facilitates amyloid production , researchers hope to push amyloid production so low that no new plaques will form .
