Headnote Parks Optical 's 6- and 8-inch Newtonian reflectors deliver top-notch optics at a reasonable price . // BY PHIL HARRINGTON The Astrolight AZ6 and AZ8 Newtonian reflectors from Parks Optical combine quality optics with a simple mount at a price that wo n't break the bank . What more could a cost-conscious amateur astronomer ask for in a scope ? * The 6-inch f/6 AZ6 and 8-inch f/6 AZ8 both feature the company 's trademark glossy white tube assembh and American made Pyrex mirrors . But instead of massive equatorial mounts , each rides on a basic alt-azimuth mount on top of a pier . Like a Dobsonian mount , the Astrolight mount moves left and right in azimuth , and up and down in altitude . This makes the scope simple for novice stargazers to use almost right out of the box . Both Astrolight scopes address the complaint that most small Dobsonian-mounted reflectors are too low to the ground . When aimed vertically , the AZ6 's eyepiece stands 58 inches ( 1.5 meters ) high , while the AZ8 's is 67 inches ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 43 inches ( 1m ) off the ground . I like to observe standing up , so I appreciate this convenience . The telescopes ' optics are housed in glossy white fiberglass tubes rather than the more common steel . They look great , but fiberglass has its pluses and minuses . While lightweight and strong , fiberglass tends to retain more heat than metal and reradiates that heat slowly at night . A telescope 's optics must acclimate to the outdoor ambient temperature to provide a sharp focus . This adds many minutes of waiting after setup , depending on the temperature where the scope was stored . Both the AZ6 and AZ8 scopes use the same Astrolight mounting . To compensate for the different tube diameters , the mount 's tapered arms can be unbolted , swapped left to right , and reattached . When the mount 's arms are farthest apart , it is set up for the 8-inch tube . When they are closest together , they accommodate the 6-inch tube . I thought that was quite clever . Each tube comes with a pair of mounting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its cradle . To keep weight down , the Astrolight mount uses a unique mix of metal and composite material . The 4-inch-diameter ( 10 centimeters ) pier is steel , while the altazimuth mount is glass- reinforced , high-impact polymer . The pier 's three legs are also made of the same composite material . When assembled , the mount and pier weigh just 25 pounds ( 11 kilograms ) . The Astrolight pier and mount assemble easily . Each of the three legs attaches to the steel pier with a single thumbscrew . A ring-shaped collar then slips over the pier and legs to lock them in place . The altazimuth mount comes preassembled , but the user must attach it to the top of the pier . The azimuth axis rides on two small ball-hearing assemblies sandwiching the mount 's head . Turning a hex-keyed flathead bolt that passes through the mount and threads into the pier 's cap adjusts the azimuth tension . It took some finesse to get that tension right . Tightening two large side-mounted knobs adjusts altitude friction on the mount . Testing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in California . Unfortunately , the shipment was a little rough . Somewhere along the way , the AZ6 's primary mirror broke tree ol the silicone adhesive holding it to its cell and banged around inside the telescope tube . By the time it arrived on my New York doorstep , the instrument was effectively destroyed . I inspected and repacked it and returned it to Parks for replacement . Thankfully , the AZ8 and second AZ6 arrived unscathed . Both the AZ8 and replacement AZ6 arrived with their primary mirrors out of collimation . I believe this was because each mirror cell 's three lockdown screws ( which the included instructions say should be tightened after the primary 's tilt is set ) were left loose . Although the illustrated instructions detail the collimation process , neither instrument comes with an alignment tool or a center-spotted primary mirror to simplify that process . At f/6 , precise collimation is required to get the most out of the AZ6 and AZ8 . So , at a minimum , owners will need a sight tube when adjusting either Astrolight . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parks ' good reputation . After setting them up this past winter , I anxiously aimed each scope toward a variety of sky objects . Because neither telescope comes with an eyepiece , I used several of my own for these tests . The standard 1 ' ' ' rack-and-pinion focuser had more than enough travel to bring each eyepiece to the focus point , including a couple that require a large amount of back-focus . To keep everything at the ready , the Astrolight mount has a built-in accessory tray for holding up to four eyepieces as well as a lew ! iIters and maybe even a small flashlight . Parks ' optics are impeccable . Whether it was the filamentary tendrils of the Orion Nebula ( M42 ) or the twinkling gems that make up some ol winter 's gleaming open clusters , the AZ6 and AZ8 did not disappoint . I kept returning to the Orion Nebula , bouncing between the wide view through a 22mm eyepiece and zeroing in on the Trapezium with a 5mm . On one night of unusually steady seeing , both scopes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Saturn , rising in the east then , also put on a wonderful show . The Cassini Division was clear in both scopes every time I turned its way . Each also revealed wonderfully fine details in Jupiter 's belted atmosphere during some frigid early morning sessions . Star testing proved that those images were no accident . With a 5mm eyepiece in place , I aimed each telescope toward a 3rd magnitude star and slowly racked the image in and out . I saw virtually identical images on either side of focus , proving the optics are indeed top-notch . Both instruments produced smooth , symmetrical patterns with virtually no indication of spherical aberration and only a slight amount of astigmatism . I judged the 8-inch mirror to be slightly better than the 6-inch , but only by a small margin .

Despite my attempts to adjust the tension on the altitude and azimuth axes , the mount 's motions were not as smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . To check the Astrolight mount 's sturdiness , I rapped the telescope tube lightly with my palm while looking through the eyepiece . Then 1 counted how many seconds it took for the image to settle down . Even with both axes locked , images through the A/8 took a long 6 seconds to calm down . The lighter , shorter AZ6 took 5 seconds . And maybe it 's because of my own big feet , but I also found the pier 's three black legs easy to trip over in the dark . Each leg extends 21 inches ( 0.5m ) from the pier . 1 would recommend owners mark the tip of each leg with white duct tape . Ibis wi ) J make them easier to see and less of a trip hazard , especially when viewing in groups or with younger observers . I was impressed with the optical performance of the AZ6 and the AZ8 Astrolight reflectors overall . Once coll i mated , images were clear and crisp , offering delightfully detailed views of the planets and deep-sky objects .

Parks Optical 's 6-inch and 8-inch Astrolight Newtonian reflectors deliver a lot of bang for the buck in terms of aperture , ease-of-use , and optical performance .
