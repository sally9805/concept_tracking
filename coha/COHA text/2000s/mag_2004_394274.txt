But the boy who never grew up shows no signs of getting old <p> SINCE HIS DEBUT a century ago , he has graced the stage in innumerable productions around the world and the screen in a classic animated Disney feature and live-action movies . His image is used to sell peanut butter and cross-country bus trips . He even entered the ranks of Greek tragedy when he joined Oedipus and Electra in having his name linked with a psychological syndrome . Peter Pan may remain forever young , but he has evolved over the course of a turbulent century , journeying far from the dark imaginings of author James Matthew Barrie . <p> It was two days after Christmas 1904 that Peter Pan first flew onto the stage of the Duke of York 's Theatre in London in the play that bore his name . There , for the first time , an enchanted public met the three Darling children , their canine nurse , Nana , the Lost Boys and an evil Captain Hook fleeing a crocodile that had swallowed a clock . When Tinker Bell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands to save her life , members of the orchestra were ready to oblige if the public declined . It proved an unnecessary precaution . <p> After pre-opening rumors of imminent disaster , the play became a surprise hit of the Christmas season , and it would make an annual holiday return for years to come . Its origins lay in the influence of five little boys on Barrie 's complex imagination . Over the years , as Peter Pan has become both a classic tale and a cultural touchstone , scholars and artists have studied Barrie 's creative relationship with the sons of Arthur and Sylvia Llewelyn Davies . Their friendship is the subject of the new movie Finding Neverland , starring Johnny Depp as Barrie in a Hollywood version of the often tragic story behind one of the century 's most popular works of children 's literature . <p> Barrie was born at the foot of the Scottish Highlands in 1860 in Kirriemuir , a town of weavers . Resting above the placid slopes that stretch to the North Sea , Kirrie , as it is known by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very heart of the mountains . Barrie was deeply influenced by his mother 's stories of the region 's past . He was exceptionally ambitious . When he was a boy , a Kirrie neighbor taught him a poem with the lines , " What can I do to be for ever known , /And make the age to come my own ? " Years later , Barrie admitted it was an apt description of his own youthful striving . He received his degree from Edinburgh University in 1882 , landed his first job as a writer with the Nottingham Journal in 1883 , and arrived in London two years later , ready to risk all as a freelance writer . His tales of Scotland , inspired by his mother 's memories , caught on . Kirriemuir , rechristened as Thrums , was soon beloved by readers of prestigious British publications such as the National Observer and St. James 's Gazette . <p> Two collections of the Kirriemuir stories , Auld Licht Idylls and A Window in Thrums , brought Barrie modest literary recognition , but the publication in 1891 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diminutive minister who loves her , placed him in the top ranks of British novelists . Robert Louis Stevenson wrote to Barrie from Samoa in 1892 : " I am a capable artist ; but it begins to look to me as if you are a man of genius . Take care of yourself for my sake . It 's a devilish hard thing for a man who writes so many novels as I do , that I should get so few to read . And I can read yours , and I love them . " <p> By 1892 , Barrie was also becoming a popular playwright . A young actress named Mary Ansell took a leading role in his Walker , London , and in 1894 she married its author . Adapting The Little Minister for the stage in 1897 cemented Barrie 's reputation as a playwright , both in London and on Broadway . <p> That year , on a stroll through Kensington Gardens , Barrie made the acquaintance of 5-year-old George and 4-year-old Jack Llewelyn Davies . The fascination was mutual . The boys found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Barrie  --  who lived with his wife and a Saint Bernard named Porthos in London 's fashionable Gloucester Road  --  found a rapt audience for his fanciful tales , which transformed the vast London park into a fairyland . His audience grew over the following decade as George and Jack were joined by three younger brothers . <p> Peter Pan made his first appearance in Barrie 's 1902 novel , The Little White Bird , which centers on a wealthy older man who befriends a young couple and their growing son . The elderly gentleman tells the boy of an infant named Peter Pan , just 7 days old , who roams the paths of Kensington Gardens and has the ability to fly . Like the Pan of Greek mythology , this Peter is a happy-go-lucky child , playing on his pipes and enjoying life . But the Peter of the novel is a mere precursor of the character in the play . As Peter evolved in Barrie 's mind , he became the central character of a new drama , that of a boy who lives out his adventures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the person of pirates , Indians and mermaids  --  and no one grows old . There the Darling children  --  Wendy ; Michael and John  --  must decide whether to remain forever young or face the responsibilities of maturity . When they finally say goodbye to Peter , they also say goodbye to childhood itself . <p> Barrie credited the Davies boys as his inspiration . " I suppose I always knew that I made Peter by rubbing the five of you violently together , as savages with two sticks produce a flame , " Barrie wrote in a preface to the published play in 1928 . " That is all he is , the spark I got from you . " <p> Barrie 's relationship with the entire family was a close one . When the boys ' father , Arthur , was diagnosed with cancer in June 1906 , Barrie helped him through the illness until he succumbed in 1907 . Focusing his attention on the boys and their widowed mother , Barrie neglected his own marriage , ultimately sending his wife into the arms of another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted on divorce rather than reconciliation . Two days after the marriage was dissolved , in 1909 , Sylvia Llewelyn Davies was herself diagnosed with cancer . Less than a year later she left her sons  --  now ranging in age from 6 to 17  --  orphaned and Barrie bereft . <p> Named their legal guardian , " Uncle Jim " became provider and mentor . He had taken a flat , high above the Thames , after his divorce , and it now became a second home for the boys . Barrie led them on fishing vacations in Scotland and sojourns to the Continent , and he saw them enrolled at Eton , Oxford and other leading schools . ( I have found no evidence to support the speculation that his attraction to the boys was unhealthy or inappropriate . Nicholas , the youngest of the five , wrote in his 70s that " I 'm glad I lived with that odd little man rather than living in poverty , or , for that matter , with virtually any other person I have ever known . " ) <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the eldest , was killed in France during World War I. Michael , a budding poet particularly close to Barrie , drowned near Oxford in 1921 while still an undergraduate . In 1960 , a long-depressed Peter Llewelyn Davies , the third oldest of the boys , threw himself before a London subway train . " ' Peter Pan ' Ruled a Suicide , " one headline put it . ( Jack had died of emphysema a year earlier , and Nicholas , the youngest , succumbed to the same disease in 1980 . ) In a notebook entry just after Michael 's death , Barrie wrote , " It is as if long after writing ' P. Pan ' its true meaning came to me  --  Desperate attempt to grow up but ca n't . " <p> Barrie 's literary output lessened significantly after Michael Davies ' death . His last work for the stage , The Boy David ( 1936 ) , tells the biblical story of David , Jonathan and King Saul . It closed after only 55 performances . Four months later , Barrie , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nicotine ) , died of pneumonia in London at the age of 77 . <p> Though he had drawn parallels between Peter Pan and himself , Barrie was in at least one important way Peter 's opposite . He sought out responsibility , taking on the cares of others . He 'd met explorer Robert Scott at a dinner party and formed a close friendship , becoming godfather to Scott 's son . Two and a half years later , when Scott lay freezing to death in the Antarctic , it was to Barrie whom he wrote , asking him to watch over his wife and son . Lady Cynthia Asquith , Barrie 's personal secretary and one of his closest friends in later life , wrote in her Portrait of Barrie , " His face continued to impress me as the most adult , the most experienced , I had ever seen , and each glance at the photograph of that six-years-old boy in braided and frogged velveteens . . . confirmed my suspicion that the creator of Peter Pan had been a case , not of arrested , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A LONG WAY in 100 years . Barrie 's official biographer , Denis Mackail , wrote in The Story of J.M.B. that Nina Boucicault , the first actress to play Peter , was " not beautiful . Or you do n't think so for a minute or two . But then her voice and movements do rather more than the trick . If Barrie writes something that raises a slight shudder in print , Miss Boucicault only has to say it and your heart turns over three times while tears trickle from your eyes . " <p> Even before Boucicault was cast in the role , Barrie had his eye on American actress Maude Adams , who had already made a success of The Little Minister on Broadway . Initially he pictured her in the part of Wendy , but producer Charles Frohman convinced him to give her the title role . " I have written a play for children , which I do n't suppose would be much use in America , " Barrie wrote to Adams in 1904 . Wendy " is rather a dear girl with ever so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy is Peter Pan in a new world . I should like you to be the boy and the girl and most of the children and the pirate captain . " Casting Adams as Peter meant that a woman also had to be cast in the London premire-and so a tradition was established that would continue for the better part of the century . <p> Barrie 's trust in Adams turned out to be well placed . " All New York may not believe in fairies , " the New York Times reported of the November 1905 opening of Peter Pan on Broadway , " but there was no doubt last night , when Tinker Bell was dying , that the audience ... irrespective of age or condition , had gotten back very near to second childhood . " <p> No less an authority than Mark Twain added his two cents . " It is my belief that Peter Pan is a great and refining and uplifting benefaction to this sordid and money-mad age , " he wrote in a letter to Adams : " The next best play on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you play Peter . " <p> Adams returned regularly to the role for more than a decade , touring with near-missionary zeal . " How splendid all the accounts of your Peter are , " wrote Barrie , who never saw her in the role himself . " I feel sure you are the most entrancing little boy that ever was by sea or shore , and I hear things you do in the part which are so absolutely what Peter did that it makes me gay . There never was such a girl as you for finding out what her author was up to . " <p> Adams returned the compliment . " My childhood and girlhood had been spent with older people , and children had always been rather terrifying to me , " she wrote in a series of reminiscences gathered in Phyllis Robbin 's Maude Adams : An Intimate Portrait . " When one met the eyes of the little things , it was like facing the Day of Judgment . Children remained an enigma to me until , when I was a woman grown , Peter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not , they understood Peter . " <p> In fact , Barrie had aimed the play  --  and his novelization of it , Peter and Wendy , published in 1911  --  at adults as well as children , and the original theatrical presentation contained a range of emotional experience that was often missing over the passing decades . Both the Disney film , released in 1953 , and the Broadway musical that opened in 1954 omit a line central to Barrie 's vision . Peter , faced with the prospect of drowning in Mermaid 's Lagoon , declares : " To die will be an awfully big adventure . " Sandy Duncan , who starred in a 1979 revival of the musical , said that the death-as-adventure line was briefly reinstated during a pre-Broadway tour . " We were coming into New York with the show , " Duncan recalled , " and our producers came to see it and they said , No . The line was too dark for family audiences . That line , though , is the heart of the play " <p> Cathy Rigby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revival in which she starred on Broadway , Peter 's seemingly eager acceptance of death was included . " Back then it was a little bit much , but certainly nowadays the children do n't have a problem with that , " she said in an interview from her home in Southern California . In Rigby 's interpretation , it 's not a fascination with death that Peter experiences , but a " way of making something good out of something tragic , " she explained . " ' I 'm going to make this an adventure , ' he says . " <p> THE MUSICAL VERSION of Barrie 's play , which became a vehicle for both Duncan and Rigby , also gave new life to Peter Pan himself when it opened on Broadway back in 1954 . It redefined the character and enshrined him in the memories of American audiences . The production , directed and choreographed by Jerome Robbins , owed much to a score that included lyrics by Betty Comden and Adolph Green and music by Jule Styne . But it was Mary Martin 's legendary performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Peter Pan a pleasure . Indeed , the show was tailored for her . The operatic " Oh , My Mysterious Lady " was inserted to highlight the star 's coloratura range . The part of Liza , maid to the Darling family , was enhanced for Martin 's daughter , Heller Halliday . The pivotal reference to death was removed , and the loneliness of a boy trapped in youth was altogether forgotten in the star 's simple embodiment of Peter 's blissful persona . <p> In her autobiography , My Heart Belongs , Martin wrote : " Peter Pan is perhaps the most important thing , to me , that I have ever done in the theater . I can not even remember a day when I did n't want to be Peter . When I was a child I was sure I could fly In my dreams I often did , and it was always the same : I ran , raised my arms like a great bird , soared into the sky ; flew . " <p> Martin 's portrayal was joyous  --  and pervasive . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1955 and 1956 and a taped production , which debuted in 1960 and was rebroadcast sporadically into the early 1970s . Her performance reigned supreme until Sandy Duncan 's phenomenal success in the role . Duncan holds the record for portraying Peter on Broadway ; with no fewer than 551 performances . " The director and I really committed to doing it as a box " Duncan says today " Before that it was always a woman playing the part . Mary did it as a leading lady " Duncan , the mother of two sons , says , " There 's a great vulnerability in young males , more than in young women .... They have such an innocence that you know is going to be lost and you ca n't do anything about it . " <p> Rigby ; who returned to the role this October , taking the show to 29 cities in what is billed as the 100th Anniversary Tour , says her performance has changed over the years . ' I 'm trying to continually make the character more an authentic child , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis Muny , which is this enormous theater . ' You were great , ' he said , ' and I really like what you did , but now that I 'm close I can see you have wrinkles . ' No adult would do that .... " <p> THE PLAY 'S OTHER CHARACTERS have made their own mark over the century Gerald du Maurier was the first actor to assay the role of Hook . His daughter , Daphne du Maurier , author of Rebecca , remembered a sinister villain very different from the caricature portrayed in the Disney film or the Broadway musical . " Children were carried screaming from the stalls , " she wrote in Gerald : A Portrait . " And even big boys of twelve were known to reach for their mother 's hand in the friendly shelter of the boxes . " <p> Wendy , with more spunk and courage than brothers Michael and John , also stands in the ranks of classic characters . ( Some critics have speculated that Barrie based the character on his mother . ) Even her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ transcription of a young admirer 's lisping , mispronounced nickname for him , " Friendy , " and became a fad . In 1954 , Roger Lancelyn Green , author of the encyclopedic Fifty Years of Peter Pan , noted that out of " all the thousands of Wendys alive today , not one is more than fifty years old . " <p> Lately ; Peter Pan 's metamorphosis seems only to have accelerated . In Steven Spielberg 's 1991 movie Hook , Robin Williams played a grown-up , fumbling Peter to Dustin Hoffman 's title villain . An animated Disney production , Return to Never Land , appeared in 2002 . Last year , director P.J. Hogan conjured a live-action feature film actually titled Peter Pan starring Jeremy Sumpter as Peter . It returned in a large degree to Barrie 's original vision , depicting a self-involved and sometimes lonely boy ; isolated from the world by his gift of eternal youth . <p> The new movie about Barrie , Finding Neverland , distorts some key facts  --  it kills off Arthur Llewelyn Davies before Barrie even meets the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his work . ( For an insightful exploration of Barrie and the boys who inspired him , nothing rivals Andrew Birkin 's J.M. Barrie and the Lost Boys , recently reissued by Yale University Press . ) <p> Most of Barrie 's writings have faded into the shadows . In the play Dear Brutus , written in 1917 , strangers gathered at a country house are offered a second chance at life , but each tragically repeats his or her critical mistake . Mary Rose ( 1920 ) is a haunting play about a mother lost in the Scottish Hebrides . She returns home , unaged , to find her infant son grown into a swaggering soldier . <p> Only Peter Pan has stood the test of time . It is Peter who will forever soar through the windows of the Darling nursery ; creating himself anew for each generation . Perhaps it is flight that makes him so appealing ; certainly it is flight that so elated his interpreters . " I wish I could express in words the joy I felt in flying , " Mary Martin wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit  --  the thing Peter always felt  --  was suddenly there for me . I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground . " Cathy Rigby described the experience in words that Barrie would surely appreciate . " You have to remember to bring your harness , " she said , " because when you 're up there you do n't even know you have it on , or that there 's a wire on you . It feels like a giggle that starts at your toes and becomes a complete feeling of freedom and joy and danger .
