It 's fair to say that Wade Horn is not your typical George W. Bush appointee . For one thing , the 47-year-old volunteered for George McGovern and played guitar in a folk-rock ensemble that favored trippy tunes like A Horse with No Name by America . Unlike Rumsfeld or Powell , he 's so soft-spoken , you have to lean in to hear him . When he spouts statistics about family-dissolution rates , you wonder how he found himself in the towel-snapping world of W. <P> Horn may have a gentle mien , but his words roil Washington . He has used his mouthful of a title  --  Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for Children and Families  --  to crusade for the government to take a more active role in promoting marriage . Horn believes that sustaining marriages is moral and cost efficient . Nearly three-fourths of children in single-parent families will experience poverty by age 11 , vs. about one-fifth of children in two-parent families . Children from intact families are less likely to give birth out of wedlock or get in trouble with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government a bundle . <P> Horn 's first big battle will be over welfare reform , which the President will promote this week . The 1996 reform that ended welfare as an entitlement needs to be renewed this year , and Horn wants to embellish it with $300 million in experimental programs to promote marriage . The money , given in grants , could go to things like family-therapy centers and health clinics that offer courses in parenthood or prewedding counseling . <P> The notion of government promotion of marriage may seem odd , if not dubious , but the idea has supporters on both the left and the right . In Oklahoma G.O.P. Governor Frank Keating aims to cut the divorce rate one-third within a decade . Indiana 's Democratic Senator Evan Bayh , a fan of Horn 's , says that marriage promotion is worth a try . " What 's the harm ? " he asks . For his part , Horn swears he 's not out to be the bad cop of matrimony or to trap people in abusive unions . " The money in this bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and want to try to stay married , " he says , noting that the middle class has access to marriage counselors while the poor do not . <P> It 's fitting that Horn should end up in the middle of the marriage issue . His career parallels two decades ' worth of debate over the meaning of family . As the head of outpatient psychological services at Washington 's Children 's Hospital in the 1980s , Horn saw the effects of broken homes and absent fathers . The experience pushed him to the right . His wife 's becoming pregnant with two girls made him , he says , more sensitive to fetuses and a foe of legal abortion . In the Administration of George Herbert Walker Bush , Horn was a mid-level appointee on family issues . Though the Bush years were marked by Dan Quayle 's Murphy Brown speech about the importance of fathers to single-mom families , the government did little to promote marriage .
