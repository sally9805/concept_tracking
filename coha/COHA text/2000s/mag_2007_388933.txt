Headnote ONCE UPON A TIME , PEOPLE KEPT SECRETS . TODAY 'S TELL-ALL BLOGGERS AND MYSPACE DENIZENS HAVE MADE THE NOTION OF A GUARDED PERSONAL LIFE FEEL OBSOLETE . WHAT EFFECT DOES SUCH EXPOSURE HAVE ON THE PSYCHE ? BY CARLIN FLORA ON MAY 11 , 2004 , JESSICA CUTLER WROTE a handy guide to keeping her love life straight and posted it on The Washingtonienne , a blog about her sexual adventures as a young Hill staffer . Five days later , on Cutler 's 26th birthday , Wonkette , a political gossip site that draws about 80,000 daily visitors , linked to the blog . Wily Internet users easily deduced the identities of her high-powered paramours , and Cutler was soon denounced in the press as a privileged young woman who was cynical , loose , and proud of it . Prostitution maybe the world 's oldest profession , but thinly disguised blogs about sex-for-cash are a new-and growing-phenomenon . Though she was fired from her job in the Senate , Cutler was rewarded generously for her extreme public disclosures with a centerfold in Playboy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her most recent appearance in the papers was in January , as Robert Steinbuch , the former Capitol Hill lawyer she identified as " RS " - her " current favorite " - sued her for $20 million . ( The court date is n't yet set . ) A leading lady of tell-all bloggers , Cutler came to fame just as online diaries began to proliferate . They 're now a nation more than 65 million strong , collectively dishing a lot of personal dirt . Bookstores and talk shows have long trafficked in the confessions of not-necessarily-notables , but the Internet has democratized and amplified personal gut spilling . Web sites such as postsecret.com and mysecret.tv bring bathroom-wall-variety confessions , such as " I only love two of my children , " " I had gay sex at church camp , " and " I pee in the sink , " to-and from-the masses . Meanwhile , teenagers telegraph their deep thoughts and petty observations for YouTube prowlers hungry for novelty and diversion . Such waves of revelation are fast eroding our notions of private identity . People have always been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to show off , but in times past these admissions were aimed at confidants-priests , soul mates , diaries . Telling secrets can be therapeutic , but when confession targets the masses , what 's really being processed , and who benefits from the disclosure ? IRONICALLY , HUMANS NOW ENJOY MORE privacy than ever , says Aaron Ben-Ze'ev , president of the University of Haifa and author of Love Online : Emotions on the Internet . " Two hundred years ago , when people lived in villages or very dense cities , everyone 's behavior was evident to many and it was extremely hard to hide it , " he says . Today , e-mail and " chatting " online allow for completely anonymous interactions . We can talk and make plans without the whole household or office knowing . But if we 're so able to keep things to ourselves , then why are we doing exactly the opposite ? For those engaging in online conversations or message-board discussions , the Internet can be more disinhibiting than the stiffest drink . Electronic disclosure eliminates the normal self-censorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primary explanation for the Jessica Cutler phenomenon . " We 've been shaped to be very sensitive to each other on a face-to-face basis , " says Daniel Wegner , a Harvard psychologist When someone is in front of you , you can read how they 're reacting to your admissions , keeping track-as you 're hardwired to do-of whether they 're comfortable , disapproving , or rapt . But when you 're alone in a room and typing on a computer , explains Wegner , it 's easy to forget there 's somebody on the other end of the line and become oblivious to the consequences of sharing information . " When people post to blogs , they may be thinking , " I 'm not going to worry too much about who the target of my revelation might be ; I 'm just going to go ahead and let go . ' " Hairdressers , bartenders , and strangers on a train have long been recipients of anonymous confessions , but they 're also participants who keep you from getting too lost in your head or revealing too much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never expected an audience beyond her close , like-minded friends . " The big problem as I saw it was using e-mails , since those could get forwarded , " says Cutler . " I thought my blog was a more private way to share stuff . " It 's one thing to risk full exposure , but quite another to eponymously tide your proudly unexpurgated blog . In I Ca n't Believe I 'm Still Single : The Eric Schaeffer Blog , a 45-year-old screenwriter and director intersperses tales of dating mishaps , recipes , musings on Gandhi , and an excruciatingly detailed account of a visit from a professional dominatrix . ( A defense of his preference for younger women reads : " I do n't get mad when women like black guys , or young guys or buff guys , it 's their preference . God bless them . STOP GETTING MAD AT ME AND THE REST OF US 45 YEAR OLD MEN WHOSE CUT OFF IS 36 OKAY ? ! ! ! " ) In exchange for his brutal honesty , he 's suffered a barrage of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life 's work to be infused with autobiographical elements , he did pause before writing the blog and a memoir : " I thought , do I want everyone to know the deep recesses of my sexuality , my parents , all that stuff ? The fear was that then people would judge me , that perhaps they would n't like me . But I did n't want to act out of fear , so I asked myself , is there a positive reason to do this ? And that would be connecting to people who appreciate me expressing myself and revealing my weaknesses . " Perhaps we simply have less to be ashamed of in an increasingly free-to-be-you-and-me era . " More and more people believe they are entitled to behave according to their own values and not the norms prevailing in society , " Ben-Ze'ev says . That means there is less of a need to keep a protected private self , free from the scrutiny of strangers . Each of us has our own ( sometimes curious ) sense of what 's appropriate : Cutler is more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some now-outdated earrings than the ones about taking money from paramours . " I did n't tell them to pay me-that 's their shame , " she says . " I 'm single . I can date as many people as I want . Apologizing for that would be stupid . " Nor do self-disclosers feel sheepish about craving the spotlight . " I 've always thought of myself as being in a movie , that my world is larger than life , " says Schaeffer . " There 's a way in which our lives seem valid only if they obtain some veneer of media recognition , " says Jefferson Singer , a psychologist at Connecticut College . A blog makes your mundane life into an electronic saga that turns you into something more than an anonymous drone in a technological and impersonal world . " You now have a story and perhaps you 've even become the focus of other watchers and listeners , " says Singer . " You become a character , a speaking part , in the larger theater of society . " Even ifyou 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unattractive-at least you 're part of the show . Schaeffer is contemplative about the vitriol his blog has garnered . " I wonder why I am not an antihero . Maybe it 's because other people purely play the schlub , whereas I claim my successes as well as my weaknesses . I embrace both . " WHAT DOES ALL THIS GUT SPILLING DO FOR THE spillers ? Is it healthy to expose your struggles , fears , and adventures to an audience ? In the second of his bestselling memoirs , Dry , Augusten Burroughs explains why public disclosure , at least in front of a small , like-minded audience , is so appealing to the confessor : " It 's like some sort of love affair , stripped of the courtship phase . I feel bathed in safety . " He 's right : Telling secrets has been shown to have a positive effect on the person who 's doing the confessing , because keeping them requires a lot of mental work . Wegner has found that actively trying to suppress a thought ( like trying not to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your mental browser and bring it to mind . " It 's almost as though there 's a little corner of the mind that 's looking for the very thing you 're trying not to think about , " he says . Sharing the secret , though , " unprimes " the information , freeing the mind to focus on other things and breaking the cycle of worry . By recounting their sins and lapses , the AA member and the blogger can unload pesky thoughts and mull more productive ones for the rest of the day . Recording concerns in a journal or similar medium can be particularly effective . " When people write about secrets , they report feeling better ; they acknowledge the events and can organize them , " says Jamie Pennebaker , professor of psychology at the University of Texas at Austin . In one study , he asked subjects to write for 15 minutes a day for several days . They showed positive changes in immune function and psychological well-being . Other research shows that when couples are asked to keep reflective diaries in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Pennebaker is n't convinced that these benefits apply to public disclosers , because bloggers , who write for an audience , probably wo n't engage in the same level of emotional processing as they would if writing just for themselves . Though their audience may be small and their true identity concealed , bloggers type with an eye toward self-presentation . They may resist the urge to lie , but they 'll be tempted to blunt the edges of ugly revelations with humorous comments . " Blogging has elements of theater , " he says . " If you 're writing and you know lots of people are going to be looking at it , you 're going to change things to make yourself look good . " Whether he realizes it or not , the online scribe cultivates an identity that anticipates and responds to its audience . " Blogging as therapy is not a good idea , " says Cutler . " When you 're blogging , you 're not thinking , " What 's my motivation ? " You 're thinking , " This is what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who writes the blog Spectacularly Normal , is convinced of the benefits . " Blogging has been immensely therapeutic for me , " she says . When she started posting about her life a year ago , Kendall , 31 , a mother of a five-year-old daughter , was unhappy . Her fianc had no idea she was anorexic and bulimic . " There was so much going on in my head and I felt really alone , " she says . After reading and feeling a kinship with other personal bloggers such as Heather Armstrong of dooce.com , Kendall set up her own page . Sharing her daily external and internal happenings has helped her sort out her feelings . She 's even found that her " open diary " can be a helpful supplement to pillow talk . " Sometimes I wake up on a weekend morning and I 'm really depressed but ca n't explain why , " Kendall says . " So I 'll sit down and post about what 's going on in my head . And my fianc will realize what I 'm doing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I 'm huddled under the covers , and he 'll say , " OK , I get this , let 's talk about it . ' ' " That " post-posting " conversation is crucial to fostering intimacy and understanding in the wake of a disclosure . " Writing things down and getting reactions is a start , but I do n't think it 's an end point , " says Singer . " You need a sustained reaction from a concerned and involved listener , so that the story does n't just end , but keeps getting written . The two of you write it together . " Otherwise , Singer says , the solo secret teller runs the risk of turning herself into an object in a story , of dissociating from her " real " life to the point where she feels like events happen to her persona and not to her . Spinning questionable actions into an amusing read can even reduce her guilt-she may start feeling less responsible to the flesh-and-blood people in her life and more beholden to her online readers . " Those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her blog material . " It 's the sort of thing where you see things happening and you can feel detached , where you think , " I ca n't wait to tell my friends about this ! ' Maybe it 's a weird coping mechanism . " Blogging may have helped Cutler justify her own actions . Or maybe , as she says , she never had qualms about them in the first place . But without their permission , she dragged other characters onto her stage . Robert Steinbuch claims in his lawsuit that he was subjected to " humiliation and anguish beyond that which any reasonable person should be expected to bear in a decent and civilized society . " For every citizen who employs freedom of speech to the hilt , there 's someone equally determined to keep a few gems-or at least trysts-to herself . And those impulses can co-exist in one person . Cutler says she gleaned insight into her D.C. affairs when writing her novel , The Washingtonienne . But she 's not interested in disclosing it . " In a way , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
