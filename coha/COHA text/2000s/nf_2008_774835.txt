The World Turned Upside Down // The American Revolution and the Slave Trade // At about ten o ? clock in the bright morning of 17 October 1781 , a lone drummer boy dressed in shabby bearskin and red coat scrambled on to the ruined earthworks outside Yorktown and beat for a parley . From their trenches , which encircled the little tobacco port like a noose , George Washington ? s forces could see him through the smoke of battle . But they could not hear him because of the thunder of their hundred guns . Firing incessantly were 24-pound siege pieces which smashed the fortifications , 8-inch howitzers which dismembered their defenders , lighter cannon whose balls splintered the clapboard houses along the bluff overlooking Chesapeake Bay and sometimes skipped over the water like flat stones , and heavy French mortars whose 200-pound projectiles  --  black bombshells clearly visible in daylight , blazing meteors after dark  --  made the whole peninsula shake . Then , behind the boy , a British officer appeared , waving a white handkerchief . He bore a message from Lord Cornwallis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposing to end the bloodshed . The barrage ceased , the emissary was blindfolded and the terms of the British surrender were negotiated . Washington , unbending in his role as the noblest republican of them all , administered a severe blow to imperial pride . Cornwallis ? s 7,200 troops were to become prisoners of war . They were to march , flags furled , between the ranks of their foes drawn up along the road from Yorktown , which passed through fields white with ripe cotton bolls , and lay down their arms . // It was a " humiliating scene , " watched in dead silence by the Americans , clad in ragged homespun , some " almost barefoot , " and their French allies , plumed and often mustachioed , immaculate in white uniforms and black gaiters , their pastel silk banners decorated with silver fleurs-de-lis . King George III ? s German mercenaries marched past steadily but the British " lobsters " ( as the Americans called them ) were less dignified . Some were the worse for rum  --  the largest single item of expenditure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were disdainful , others defiant . A few flung down their heavy , smooth-bored Brown Bess muskets as though to smash them . Lieutenant-Colonel Abercromby , who had led the only serious sortie from Yorktown , chewed his sword in impotent rage . According to an American witness , the British officers behaved like whipped schoolboys . " Some bit their lips , some pouted , others cried , " hiding such emotions beneath their round , broad-brimmed hats . Cornwallis himself remained in Yorktown , pleading indisposition but perhaps unable to face the triumph of revolution . Meanwhile , the bandsmen of his captive army played a " melancholy " tune on drums and fifes . It was the dirge of the British Empire in America , " The World Turned Upside Down . " // The Old World did regard the New World ? s victory as an ominous inversion of the established order . It was an unbeaten revolt of children against parental authority  --  the first successful rebellion of colonial subjects against sovereign power in modern history . How could a rabble of farmers in thirteen poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat the trained might of the mother country ? Americans were divided among themselves and thinly spread along an underdeveloped eastern seaboard which shaded gradually into isolated pioneer settlements and virgin wilderness . They were opposed not only by white loyalists but by black slaves and " Red Indians . " Washington ? s recruits , in a spirit of democratic " licentiousness " ( his word ) , were disinclined to take orders without discussion : as one senior officer complained , " The privates are all generals . " Their auxiliaries , until the advent of the French , were wholly undisciplined . The militia consisted of summer foot soldiers on furlough from the plough and , wrote one witness , a cavalry of round-wigged tailors and apothecaries mounted on " bad nags " who looked " like a flock of ducks in cross-belts . " These were supported at times by tattooed and buckskinned frontiersmen with tomahawks in their belts , bear grease in their hair and coonskin hats on their heads . // Yet this motley array often proved effective , particularly in guerrilla fighting . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened hostilities at Lexington in 1775 , the redcoats made such a " vigorous retreat , " quipped Benjamin Franklin , that the " feeble Americans could scarce keep up with them . " On other occasions British generals proved dauntlessly incompetent . " Gentleman Johnny " Burgoyne distinguished himself less as a professional soldier than an amateur dramatist  --  when his play The Bloodbath of Boston was performed the audience at first thought that American shelling was part of the show  --  and in 1777 his histrionic recklessness led to the British capitulation at Saratoga . By contrast , George Washington , though by no means a military genius , was a great leader . Tall and stately in his familiar buff and blue uniform , with a long pallid face dominated by a jutting nose , a broad mouth and steely grey-blue eyes , he looked the part . And he played it with courage and canniness . Formidably self-possessed , ruthlessly single-minded , incomparably tenacious , he made small gains and avoided large losses , staving off defeat until he could achieve victory . // Before Yorktown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote , despite the support of Spain and Holland as well as France , which the Earl of Chatham described as a " vulture hovering over the British Empire . " Redcoat bayonets dominated the battlefield and Britannia still ruled the waves . General Clinton had an iron grip on New York . From there he wrote to Cornwallis in March 1781 : // Discontent runs high in Connecticut . In short , my Lord , there seems little wanting to give a mortal stab to Rebellion but a proper Reinforcement , and a permanent superiority at Sea for the next Campaign without which any Enterprize depending on Water Movements must certainly run great Risk . // Cornwallis himself was subjugating the south . He was assisted by Colonel Banastre Tarleton , who boasted of having " butchered more men and lain with more women than anybody "  --  he should have said ravished , remarked the playwright Sheridan , since " rapes are the relaxation of murder . " Washington ? s forces had scarcely recovered from their winter agonies at Valley Forge and Morristown , where , as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a Degree that I who never flinched to old Boreas had t ? other day one of my Ears froze as hard as a Pine gnut . " In the spring of 1781 Washington wrote , // our Troops are approaching fast to nakedness and . . . we have nothing to cloath them with . . . our hospitals are without medicines , and our Sick without Nutriment . . . all our public works are at a stand . . . we are at the end of our tether . . . now or never our deliverance must come . // It came with French men-of-war. // In August , Washington heard that Admiral de Grasse was sailing with a fleet of twenty-eight ships of the line and bringing three thousand more regular soldiers to reinforce the five thousand commanded by the Comte de Rochambeau . Washington seized his opportunity . In great secrecy he disengaged from Clinton and marched his army south through New Jersey . When he heard that de Grasse had reached Chesapeake Bay , cutting Cornwallis off from outside help , Washington abandoned his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chester , waving his hat and his handkerchief , and embraced Rochambeau as he arrived . The young Marquis de Lafayette was even more effusive when he met Washington at Williamsburg . He leapt off his horse , " caught the General round his body , hugged him as close as it was possible and absolutely kissed him from ear to ear . " The news was a tonic to the whole army  --  it even cured General Steuben ? s gout . For everyone except the British believed that Cornwallis would be " completely Burgoyned . " " We have got him handsomely in a pudding bag , " wrote General Weedon . " I am all on fire . By the Great God of War , I think we may all hand up our swords by the last of the year in perfect peace and security ! " // Washington personally ensured that his " mouse-trap " snapped shut . He made meticulous preparations , even going so far as to pay his troops ( with French gold ) . He surveyed Yorktown ? s defences from an exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hail . " With a pickaxe he broke the ground for the opening trench and he put a match to the first gun in the cannonade . Washington pressed forward fast , puzzled by the sluggishness of the enemy . Although erratic , Cornwallis was an able commander . He was brave , tactically adept and adored by his men , whose hardships he shared . But apart from shooting starving horses and expelling hungry slaves ( many of them ill with malaria , smallpox and dysentery ) , he took few initiatives at Yorktown . This was because , as he told Clinton , his army could only be saved by a successful naval action . However , de Grasse had seen off the British fleet in an indecisive battle on 5 September and Washington persuaded him to remain on guard . By the end of the month Clinton informed Cornwallis : " I am doing everything in my power to relieve you by a direct move and I have reason to hope from the assurance given me this day by Admiral Graves that we may pass the Bar by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accident happens . " But the Royal Navy was in no state to break the French hold on Chesapeake Bay . // It was ill led by Lord Sandwich , First Lord of the Admiralty , who , the philosopher David Hume complained , spent several weeks trout-fishing at Newbury with " two or three Ladies of Pleasure . . . at a time when the Fate of the British Empire is in dependance , and in dependance on him . " It lacked necessities : in the West Indies Admiral " Foul-weather Jack " Byron had " a fleet to equip without stores , to victual without provisions , to man without men . " It also suffered from less obvious defects . Among them was a hidden canker caused by the new system of sheathing the bottoms of wooden vessels in copper . This eliminated marine growth , crustacea and plants which slowed ships down , and the teredo worm which honeycombed their oaken keels in tropical waters . However , until a technical solution was found to the problem ( as it was in time to defeat the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underwater iron fastenings . This sometimes led to sudden disasters : merely by firing her seventy-four guns during the action against de Grasse , the Terrible almost shook herself to pieces and the following day she had to be scuttled . So for a time England was evicted from " the throne of Neptune . " // The naval situation determined both the fate of the thirteen colonies and the shape of the British Empire . If Cornwallis had been evacuated the French and perhaps even the Americans might have sued for peace on George III ? s terms . As it was , his First Minister , Lord North , spoke for nearly everyone in Britain , except the contumacious King himself , when he exclaimed on hearing the news of Yorktown : " Oh God ! it is all over ! " He repeated the words many times , throwing his arms about and pacing his Downing Street room " under emotions of the deepest agitation and distress . " In relative terms Yorktown was a small defeat but its significance was great : it threatened to eclipse " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The famous phrase was apparently first coined by Sir George Macartney in 1773 and down the years endless variations were played on it , often with gloomy emphasis on the final stage of the solar trajectory . Lord Shelburne , long a fierce opponent of coercing the colonies , feared that their independence would end imperial greatness and " the sun of England might be said to have set . " In his first comment on Cornwallis ? s debacle he adorned the image . Shelburne told parliament that the King had " seen his empire , from a pitch of glory and splendour perfectly astonishing and dazzling , tumbled down to disgrace and ruin which no previous history could parallel . " // Yet in truth the ramshackle imperial edifice had never been securely based . From the first , when the English began haphazardly planting colonies and setting up trading posts overseas during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , the mother country ? s sway had been challenged . Settlers , traders , conquerors , dissenters , preachers , trappers , explorers , freebooters , treasure-hunters , lawbreakers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moreover they carried its seed with them . At least as warmly as their kith and kin at home , they cherished the ideal of " English liberty . " And they cited natural law , scriptural authority , ancient precedent and modern philosophy ( notably that of James Harrington , John Locke and David Hume ) in defence of their freedom . They also worked for it , electing assemblies to control the purse strings and to rival the mother of parliaments in London . These " little Westminsters " sought to dominate colonial Governors , who were disparaged as grasping rogues  --  here a " needy Court-Dangler " or " a hearty , rattling wild young Dog of an officer , " there an " excellent buffoon " or a fellow who had distinguished himself " in the profession of pimping . " Bad government or no government at all  --  known as " salutary neglect "  --  the Americans could endure . But after 1765 the conviction that they had become the victims of tyranny overcame their instinctive feelings of loyalty to the old country and its King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sense , " the Royal Brute of Great Britain . " The Stamp Act , which Boston greeted with flags flown at half mast and muffled peals of bells , was viewed less as a fiscal imposition than as a measure of political oppression . " No taxation without representation " became the rallying cry of Americans determined to enjoy " the rights of Englishmen . " Many at Westminster concurred , among them Chatham , Edmund Burke and Charles James Fox , who appeared in what looked like an American uniform , toasted Washington ? s forces as " our army " and spoke of an English victory as " terrible news . " Fox ? s quasi-treasonable vehemence reflected his commitment to a " tradition of liberty " which led to " the final undoing of the entire colonial project in America . " Imperium et libertas later became the watchword of British imperialists and the motto of the Primrose League ; but as W. E. Gladstone would famously point out , the phrase was a contradiction in terms . In the last resort , liberty was at odds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other reasons for anticipating imperial decline and fall . Like the sunset , it seemed a natural phenomenon . It was part of a process of individual and cosmic decay that had been regarded as inevitable since the fall of Babylon , perhaps since the fall of Adam . Hesiod had even visualised that in the old age of the world babies would be " born with greying temples . " The logic of the process was confirmed by the recurring metaphor of maturity : Francis Bacon , Thomas Hobbes and many others had said colonies were " children " which , as they grew up , might expect to separate from their parent kingdom . In similar vein , the French economist Turgot compared colonies to fruits which detach themselves from a tree when they are ripe , as provinces did from Rome . Both Joseph Addison and James Thomson compared ancient Rome and modern Britain , contrasting their glories with the decadence of contemporary Italy . Empires clearly evolved , vigorous new growth replacing rotten old fabric . What is more , as Bishop Berkeley memorably prophesied , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It advanced from corrupt Europe to pristine America  --  where , in a reverse version of the conceit , Thomas Jefferson said that a journey eastward from the frontier to the coast was " equivalent to a survey , in time , of the progress of man from the infancy of creation to the present day . " The idea that progress followed Apollo ? s chariot was heard from " Horace to Horace Greeley . " And its transatlantic course was dramatised in a futuristic jeu d ? esprit published by Lloyd ? s Evening Post in 1774 . It was set in 1974 and featured two visitors from " the empire of America " touring the ruins of London . These resembled Piranesi prints of Roman ruins  --  empty , rubble-strewn streets , a single broken wall where parliament once stood , Whitehall a turnip field , Westminster Abbey a stable , the Inns of Court a pile of stones " possessed by hawks and rooks , " and St. Paul ? s , its dome collapsed , open to the sky . The sun had set on British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artisans and workers , it had risen over " Imperial America . " After the loss of the thirteen colonies , the British did indeed fear that their Empire , however wide its bounds , was vulnerable to expanding America . They looked with apprehension and fascination at the Great Republic , seeing it as the wave of the future . That astute gossip Horace Walpole pronounced that " The next Augustan Age will dawn the other side of the Atlantic . " Casting " horoscopes of empires " in the manner of Rousseau , he forecast that travellers from the New World would " visit England and give a description of the ruins of St Paul ? s.
