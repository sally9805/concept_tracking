Thursday , May 22 , 1567 Her way illuminated by a full moon , Constance Crane left Mill Hall in the hour before midnight to follow the footpath that led past the abandoned chapel . The unexpected crack of a twig under her own foot made her gasp . Closing her eyes for a moment , she waited for her heart to stop racing . She told herself there was nothing to fear . She had walked the short distance to her cousin 's cottage many times in daylight . She ought to be able to navigate the route blindfolded . As she resumed her journey , her wary gaze attracted by every flicker of movement , every wisp of sound , she wondered if having her eyes covered might not be an advantage . Shimmering moonlight picked out the most hazardous obstacles underfootexposed roots and rocks and the likeand helped her stay on the hard-packed trail , but it also created ominous shadows . Constance had the uneasy sense someone was behind her , keeping just out of sight but watching her every move . Nonsense ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more reasons to remain within doors than to go out . Sensible folk went to bed early and rose with the sun to take up the day 's duties . Constance doubted she 'd be able to perform with her accustomed efficiency on the morrow , thanks to this night 's business , but that could not be helped . Nor would she change her mind about meeting Lucy . Constance had promised to assist her cousin , and she prided herself on being a woman of her word . She hurried past the chapel and the two giant elms that stood on either side of it like twin sentinels . Had they been planted there to guard a holy place against evil ? Superstition held that spirits walked the earth after dark . Demons appeared then , too , and the faeries who made the milk go sour . And everyone knew that corruption traveled in the night air , spreading the plague and other terrible sicknesses . Dread riding on her shoulder , Constance had to force herself to plunge into the thick cluster of trees beyond the chapel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? Above her head , interwoven branches of elm and beech stood out in silhouette against the sky , swaying and dipping in a strange dance choreographed by gusts of wind coming in off the Narrow Seas . A low-growing bush snagged Constance 's skirt . She broke into a run , certain it was a hand grasping at her . A moment later , she burst free of the wooded stretch , entering the rectangular clearing that was her goal . By then , her chest heaved and her heart seemed to slam against her ribs with every ragged breath . Lucy waited outside her door , a basket over one arm . She regarded Constance 's panic-stricken countenance and harried demeanor with ill-concealed amusement . " I perceive you have never been out alone in the dark before . There is naught to fear from traveling by night , but it might have been less upsetting had you carried a lantern . " Brought up short by the brusque , matter-of-fact words , Constance reined in her overactive imagination and felt herself flush with embarrassment even as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have reached the cottage , but when she looked over her shoulder she saw that Lucy was right . She 'd had no reason to be frightened . Neither man nor demon nor faery king had followed her out of the trees . Only a ghost , she thought with wry self-mockery . For this was not , in truth , the first time she had braved the night 's dangers on her own . Her memory jogged by Lucy 's comment , Constance recalled with vivid clarity that long-ago midnight when she 'd crept out of the room where Lady Northampton 's ladies slept and gone to meet a lover . She 'd been very young and surpassing foolish , and she 'd had no qualms about braving the extensive gardens of a country estate in the dark to give herself to a handsome young man in the duke of Northumberland 's household . Together they 'd reveled in the heady delights of the flesh and in the excitement of their own daring . " Come along , " Lucy urged , taking Constance 's arm for support . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she made good speed . Constance had to move swiftly to keep pace with her . Lucy 's excitement was so intense that she fair vibrated with it . There was no stopping her . After being bedridden and housebound for much of the winter just past , she was determined upon her quest . Constance was prepared to endure for Lucy 's sake . Although she knew a number of people who had lived more than her cousin 's sixty years , they were hardy souls . Lucy was frail , unfit to go wandering through the woods alone . And yet , if Constance had not agreed to accompany her , she 'd have attempted this expedition on her own . After nursing Lucy all those months , and comforting her more recently , when she 'd learned of the death of a longtime acquaintance , Constance felt an obligation to continue looking after her cousin . Besides , she 'd grown fond of Lucy . Once more , Constance found herself following a moonlit path through thickly wooded darkness . She swallowed an anxious protest when Lucy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of direction , unable to tell if they were still on Mill Hall land or if they had crossed over onto property belonging to the Edgecumbes , Constance put her faith in her cousin . Lucy had confidence enough for them both . The older woman never faltered , never slowed down until they reached their destination . " There . " Triumph in her voice , she pointed one gnarled finger toward a cluster of plants growing wild in the wood . " I do not see why we could not have come here in daylight , " Constance murmured . " I have told you my reasons . " Lucy 's querulous voice sounded loud in the stillness of the night . " The leaves are most potent if they are gathered between Lady Day and Midsummer 's Eve . Collecting them in the full of the moon adds to their power . Should congestion of the lungs ever bring me as close to death 's door again as it did on St. Valentine 's Day , then these leaves , plucked at their strongest , have the power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for herself how a pinch of this herb , ground and dissolved in sweet wine , had eased Lucy 's struggle to breathe . Besides , they were here now . They might as well continue . She picked her way over the last uneven stretch , knelt , and reached for the nearest stalk . " Wait ! " With excruciating slowness , Lucy lowered herself to the ground beside Constance . One knee made a sharp popping sound . " Ritual is important . The herb must be crossed and blessed when it is gathered . " She made the sign of the cross , then bowed her head . " Hallowed be thou , vervain , as thou growest in the ground , for in the mount of Calvary , there thou was first found . Thou healedst our Saviour , Jesus Christ , and staunchedst his bleeding wound . In the name of the Father , the Son , and the Holy Ghost , I take thee from the ground . " No hasty plucking of leaves would do for Lucy Milborne . Constance resigned herself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayers when the job was done . By then , Lucy 's bad leg had further stiffened from kneeling in the early-morning dew . They returned to her cottage at a snail 's pace . Dawn was not far off when they reached the door of the stillroom . " I have one other favor to ask of you , child . " Lucy deposited her basket , filled to overflowing , on a long worktable . Tired as she was , Constance did not think of refusing . She even managed a small smile at her cousin 's use of the endearment . Lucy might be some twenty years older than she , but by no stretch of the imagination did that make Constance a child . " There is a root in my herb garden that needs digging up . " Lucy rubbed her right knee . " I can do the work myself . Never think I can not . But without your help I will have the devil 's own time getting to my feet again when it is done . " " I will unearth your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one it is . " Constance had lived so long in the household of the late marchioness of Northampton , without making use of her early lessons in plant lore , that she had all but forgotten them . She knew the smells and uses of more apothecary-made medicines than most women but was perilous ignorant when it came to the appearance of single ingredients in their natural state . The rising sun found Lucy and Constance both kneeling in Lucy 's small garden . What should have been a simple task had taken far longer than either of them had anticipated . Constance glanced up from her struggles to discover she 'd been caught in a most undignified position by one of the servants from Mill Hall . Arthur Kennison was gaping at them from the path . When she scowled at him , he hastened to avert his eyes and continue on his way through the clearing . Lucy gave a dismissive snort . " That fellow again ! " " Does he often come this way ? " " Of late he does . " Constance stared in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if one stayed on it instead of veering off to pick vervain , led to only one placeEdgecumbe Manor . " Is he on his own business or Hugo 's ? " Constance wondered aloud . Hugo Garrard , who was cousin to both Lucy and herself , had spent considerable time with his nearest neighbor before Clement Edgecumbe 's sudden death . He might well make a special effort to look out for Edgecumbe 's widow and daughter , but would he choose to send Kennison , the least trustworthy of Mill Hall 's servants , to carry his messages ? " Help me up , " Lucy said , distracting Constance from her speculations . When she 'd settled her cousin in the stillroom , Constance returned to Mill Hall . The way was passing ordinary in daylight . Busy with her duties as Hugo 's housekeeper , Constance had no notion that anything was amiss in the neighborhood until the local constable , a carpenter by trade , arrived late in the day . " I are come to arrest you , Mistress Crane . " At first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words made no sense . Neither did the emotion she recognized in his eyes . Why should he be afraid ? " For what crime ? " " It is charged that you and old Mother Milborne did bewitch Peter Marsh to death and that she did kill Clement Edgecumbe by witchcraft . " Stunned , Constance took a step away from him . She could scarce take in all the shocks contained in that one sentence . For a moment , she fixed on the least of the strangeness , wondering why he 'd addressed Lucy as Mother instead of Mistress . Then the rest of what he 'd said crashed in on her . A ripple of alarm shook her out of her state of dazed incomprehension . " Marsh can not be dead . " Constance had seen Hugo 's former clerk only two days earlier . He 'd been hale and hearty ... and up to his usual tricks . Hugo , face pale within a shock of reddish brown hair and the little tuft of his beard , his heavy-lidded eyes wider than Constance had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kennison , stone-faced and for once showing no evidence of being cup-shot , appeared at his elbow . " ' T is true , Constance , " Hugo said . " I can scarce believe it myself , but we have just been to see the body . There is no doubt it is Marsh . " Death could come of a sudden . She knew that . But accepting Marsh 's demise forced her to contemplate the remainder of the constable 's remarkable statement . Her hands felt clammy as she clenched them into fists at her sides . Holding herself still , she struggled to order her thoughts and keep panic at bay . Marsh was dead and she was accused of killing him . By witchcraft . " I am not a witch , " she whispered . " How else do you explain the circumstances of his death ? " Drawn by the commotion , Mill Hall 's servants had left their duties to come and gawk at the tableau in the hall . The cook , who just an hour earlier had exchanged cheerful , friendly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Emma , the young maidservant she 'd befriended , appeared to be too terrified to speak . And the chaplain , who might have been expected to play a role in such proceedings , kept in the background , his expression guarded . " When did he die ? " Constance managed to conquer her dread long enough to address the constable . " And where ? " " He was found this morning , within sight of Mother Milborne 's cottage . " The constable lowered his voice as a note of awe crept into it . " He lay dead , not a mark upon him , face down under the wych elm . " In the horrified silence that followed this announcement , Constance began to feel light-headed . Her stomach clenched in fear . " Mother Milborne is already in custody , " the constable continued . " You will both be tooken to Maidstone for trial at the summer Assizes . " Maidstonethe shire town for Kent . Assizesthe twice-annual court at which felons were tried . And after , executed . Constance fought for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or faint . She had to think . There must be some way out of this terrifying situation . She was not a witch and neither was Lucy . Lucy was accused of bewitching Clement Edgecumbe to death ? Had the constable said that ? The charge was preposterous . Lucy had still been all but bedridden when her neighbor died . And she 'd been distraught when the news was brought to her that he was dead . They 'd not been friends . They 'd quarreled too often for that . But they 'd known each other all their lives and Lucy had admitted to Constance that she 'd miss " the old goat . " Constance tried again to deny the charges , but no one listened . Under guard , she was escorted to her own bedchamber . She and Lucy , she was informed , were to be kept prisoner at Mill Hall overnight and taken north on the morrow . There was a proper gaol in Maidstone . Left alone , Constance could no longer hold her horror at bay . She sat , staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing waves . But she had never been the sort to weep and wail and bemoan her fate . When the onslaught had at last passed by , she was able to think again , to consider what she could do to save herself . If Lucy had been fit , Constance would have found her , freed her , and run away , but that was not possible . The Assizes , she remembered , met sometime in the middle of July . That meant she and Lucy would spend many weeks in gaol . She did not allow herself to dwell on that bleak prospect but instead considered that the same span of time might be used to their benefit . They 'd need an ally , someone she could persuade to look into the two deaths and discover their true cause . An ironic smile twisted Constance 's lips at the name that came at once to mind . Yes , she would know how to proceed . She had been in a similar situation herself some two years earlier . She 'd escaped the gallows by uncovering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last person on earth who would be inclined to help Constance Crane , for she was the widow of the man Constance had met in that garden , and other gardens , all those years ago . Constance passed a long , sleepless night but she could think of no one better suited to her purpose . She spent the hour before dawn composing a letter . She had nothing to lose by asking , and she did not make her request only for herself . Lucy had never even met Constance 's lover . " Thank the Lord , " Constance whispered when the first person to enter her chamber was someone she considered trustworthy . In haste , before the constable and his men came to take her away , she explained what she wanted done . She left Mill Hall buoyed up by a faint stirring of hope . She 'd exacted a promise . Within the hour , a messenger would be dispatched to take her missive to its destination .                @ @ @ @ @
