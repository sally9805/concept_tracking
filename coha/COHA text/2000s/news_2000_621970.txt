<p> PLANT SOME SEEDS TO IMPROVE LIFE <p> Editor  --  Here comes Spring ! Seeds , sprouts and taxes ! A strange mix ? Yes and no . Here 's an idea . At this time of new beginnings , as you work your soil , consider new ways of working with money . Scary thought , sure , but the possibilities for benefit to ourselves and our planet are excellent right now . <p> Think of the good that can be done by investing in effective funds . At this time of soaring stock profits , there are more socially responsible funds than ever before , and many are performing very well indeed , contrary to rumor . Some of these funds simply screen out negatives , by avoiding companies that are destructive to life 's resources , or destructive of the lives of those who work for them or live near their factories . Other funds are highly proactive , investing in companies working hard to do business in ways that benefit all involved : workers , clients , consumers , Earth dwellers , Earth herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " there 's nothing we can do " to help stop the tide of destruction . And it 's too tragic . What we do with our money  --  our life energy  --  has a huge impact on the quality of life right now , and far into the future of our children 's children . Why not plant some seeds for a wholesome future by moving some money into funds that help , rather than hurt , life on this sweet , generous Earth ? <p> JESS RIVER <p> Albion <p> . <p> TAX CONFORMITY <p> Editor  --  At tax time 2000 we are stuck with a California personal income tax process that needs to be reformed . Why ca n't we just pay the state a percentage of our federal income taxes without having to file a separate return ? <p> Granted there are some differences between California and federal tax law , but there is clearly a general conformity between the two . There should be a way to reconcile any areas of difference to permit the state to adopt a more rational and much less expensive procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The senseless and wasteful process now in place must be costing taxpayers millions and millions of dollars in unnecessary expenses . With a simplified plan calling for us to pay a percentage of what we pay the IRS , we should be able to dismantle , or at least downsize , a redundant , superfluous Sacramento bureaucracy , reduce state expenses , and eliminate a needless source of irritation to taxpayers . <p> HUGH O'DONNELL <p> Menlo Park <p> . <p> HERO 'S COURAGE <p> Editor  --  Your article on Medal of Honor awardee Charles Liteky is very welcome at this time when hearing of the deeds of true heroes is rare and when cynicism is the prevailing mood in the land . <p> Last November , 4,000 of us marched onto the Army base at Fort Benning , Ga. , where the School of the Americas ( SOA ) trains Latin American military personnel and again witnessed Charlie 's determination and courage . As we reached police lines , despite pleas from high-ranking military personnel who tried to dissuade Charlie from proceeding , he moved with vigor and determination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us forward . We continued to bear witness to the many innocents who have suffered because of the SOA and to demand closure of this school supported with our tax dollars . <p> Hopefully , more Americans will join us to question why the United States must support and train armies from the poverty-stricken countries to the south . Could it be to promote democracy there , as the Army contends ; or is it to train " enforcers " to further subjugate and terrorize those populations and maintain the economic status quo which has benefited only the wealthy for centuries ? <p> DOLORES PEREZ PRIEM <p> SOA Watch West <p> San Francisco <p> . <p> REAGAN 'S LEGACY <p> Editor  --  Two of the Republican candidates were simply glowing over the term , " Reaganesque Republicans . " Now I know better than to bad mouth an old man who was president of our country for two full terms , and is now very near the end of his life , but his effect on what happened in this country and the world , must be dealt with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sleepwalking Through History , " by Haynes Johnson , which is , in my opinion , the most honest criticism of the Reagan years yet presented . Haynes Johnson is not careless with words , and all events and quotations are documented . <p> He points out that at the end of his term , 138 officials of the Reagan administration had been convicted , indicted , or subject to official investigation for official misconduct and/or criminal violations . He goes on to say that in terms of numbers of officials involved , the record of his administration was the worst ever . <p> If I were trying to impress people with my principles and beliefs , I would not care to be linked with that record ! <p> SVEN H. ANDERSON <p> St. Helena <p> . <p> HEADWATERS AGREEMENT <p> Editor  --  The Chronicle story on the status of the Headwaters Agreement one year later , " Headwaters Trouble , " on March 1 , was unfortunately misleading . <p> The historic Headwaters Agreement not only preserved the last remaining large stand of old-growth redwood in private ownership , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a comprehensive Habitat Conservation Plan ( HCP ) for the remainder of our forest lands . The HCP provides for unprecedented protections far in excess of those required by the state forest practice rules , and were extolled by , among others , Sen. Feinstein , Secretary Babbitt and Gov . Gray Davis at the time of their adop tion . <p> The Pacific Lumber Company is fully implementing the Habitat Conservation Plan agreed to as part of the Headwaters Agreement . The grousing by an environmental extremist ( who has consistently opposed the Headwaters Agreement ) that we are " avoiding proper implementation " and trying to " reinterpret the plan " is pure bunk . The comments by the Department of Forestry spokesman make that clear . <p> Further , CDF recently commended PALCO for " doing an excellent job of improving compliance " with the state 's forest practice rules . This is an area of particular focus this past year and clearly reflects our commitment to doing the job in proper fashion . <p> Under the HCP , we are gathering and analyzing scientific information that will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our forests in the future . This watershed analysis process is n't a PALCO process  --  but rather involves all relevant state and federal agencies as partners and has substantial public involvement . It is in everyone 's interest that this process be kept scientific and not politicized . The site-specific measures that will be produced through the watershed analysis process will assure healthy , productive forests on a sustainable basis accompanied with more than adequate protections for fish and wildlife . <p> JOHN A. CAMPBELL <p> President &; Chief Executive Officer <p> The Pacific Lumber Company <p> Scotia <p> . <p> JAM-PACKED MUSEUM <p> Editor  --  The plight of the Dollar Liner President Coolidge model being in the ladies rest room , as mentioned in Scott Ostler 's column on February 16 , highlights a serious space problem that has plagued San Francisco 's maritime museum almost from its beginning 50 years ago in the WPA 's Aquatic Park bathhouse . The steamship room is so small and completely filled that one gets a feeling of claustrophobia in it . <p> More than twice as much of the museum 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Many objects have never been seen by the public . When the National Park Service moved a further collection of objects recently from the Haslett Warehouse at Hyde Street Pier to storage at the old Alameda Naval Air Station , they were found to need 77,000 square-feet of space . Included were 110 small historic boats . Still more museum objects are scattered in 22 locations around the Bay Area . The present museum has less than 10,000 square-feet . <p> What is needed is a new facility to enable the museum in its entirety to fulfill its mission for today and the future . The bathhouse is a national historic landmark and can not be altered or replaced . The Haslett warehouse , once considered for a museum , is not suitable . Four years ago , Pier 32 was proposed as a site to bring all of the museum and its historic ships together . Before that it was China Basin . Those options are gone now , but a new location still needs to be considered , if only for a museum site alone . <p> RAYMOND @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Editor  --  There is one law affecting the gun owners of America that can not be amended , repealed or opposed by the National Rifle Association . It is the law of averages , that determines that , with more than 200 million guns in the hands of American citizens , ten children will die every day from accidental shootings . <p> OSMOND MOLARSKY <p> Ross
