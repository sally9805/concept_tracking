Headnote Come along as two big fans of the Gulf Coast revisit their favorite spots-and discover new ones-from Ocean Springs , Mississippi , to Louisiana 's Cajun Country . First Stop : " The " burg " En route to Biloxi from Birmingham , we decided to explore downtown Hattiesburg . Home of the University of Southern Mississippi ( USM ) , Hartiesburg enjoys that special blend of grand old traditions and a young , energetic vibe that sets many of the South 's college towns apart . A friend at USM pointed us to several nifty finds , including New Yokel Market &; Side Door Cafe for organics ; Main Street Books , a fine independent bookstore ; and The Bottling Company , a popular music venue in a renovated warehouse . We sampled terrific sandwiches in a cool , urban atmosphere at Brownstone 's , where locals come for live blues . ( My pick from the menu was a tasty chicken salad sandwich , $8.99 , with a side of honey-pineapple coleslaw . ) Just up the street from Brownstone 's is A Gallery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jewelry , photography , art glass , pottery , and other works by Mississippi artists , and she spotlights an artist of the month . Her June artist is Impressionist painter Joyce Bradley , who has an affinity for beautiful , distinctively Southern landscapes filled with flowers . I asked Joyce if she 's a gardener . " No , " she said with a grin and a nod to her canvas . " I do my gardening in the air-conditioning . " ( For an interview with Joyce , visit southernliving.com/ june2007 . ) Living Luxe at the Beau Next we headed to Biloxi and " the Beau . " As much as Dave and I love traveling off the beaten path , some places are famous for a reason . We ca n't resist Beau Rivage and made it our base camp for exploring several coastal towns . This is one fabulous resort with a stunning lobby and shopping promenade , plenty of restaurants and nightlife , an elegant spa , a brand-new golf course , and ( our personal favorite ) a drop-dead gorgeous pool overlooking Mississippi Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your tan . ( For those of us who grow weary of dingding-ding casino noise , the Beau is arranged so that you can easily dodge the gaming floor . ) We were eager to see what a $550-million renovation could do to an $800-million hotel . The short answer ? A lot . They 've added a variety of new restaurants and shops ( do n't miss the $10 Boutique for budget baubles ) . Guest rooms are downright plush now with 32-inch flat-screen TVs , deliciously poufed pillows and linens , and marbled baths with separate showers and soaking tubs . We booked an upper-floor room that faced the water and woke up to incredible views every morning . Laid-back in Ocean Springs Just a stone 's throw from the Beau is one of our favorite small towns , Ocean Springs , Mississippi . With its cottagey storefronts , streets lined with live oaks , and an eclectic mix of galleries , restaurants , and shops , it is a great place to stroll , chill , and chat up the locals . This old coastal community attracts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hip at the same time . It 's also a pedestrian traveler 's dream because many of its best offerings line two main drags , Washington Avenue and Government Street , which inter sect in the heart of town . Among our favorites are Two Dogs Dancing , jampacked with gifts for pets and the people who adore them ; On the Menu : A Kitchen Gallery , a mix of fun and function with great kitchen tools , colorful tableware , and more ; the famed Walter Anderson Museum of Art ; and The Art House on Cash Alley , a gallery for a local artists ' consortium . Many more shops and restaurants are sprinkled about the heart of Ocean Springs . Our delicious , down-home breakfast at McElroy 's on the Bayou fueled us for a day 's shopping . For dinner , we tried the ultracasual Government Street Grocery , which has patio dining . Dave discovered the wonders of the muffuletta , an Italian-inspired , native New Orleans sandwich made with salami , ham , provolone cheese , and olive salad . The Grocery can attract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little like the hall monitors , but we got over it when we tasted the food and saw the low prices . It 's All Good in Bay Saint Louis Remember the " class favorites " section in your high school yearbook ? If there was a yearbook for towns , Bay Saint Louis would get " Most Fun-Loving . " Katrina hit Bay Saint Louis hard , particularly the waterfront Old Town area . Strange as it may sound , though , that 's one of the reasons why everybody should go . These folks have lost a lot , but they remain one of the most colorful , upbeat , creative , welcoming communities we 've ever found . Take Trapani 's Eatery . Temporarily on U.S. 90 , Jolynne and Tony Trapani hope to move their restaurant back to the bayside in early 2008 . The couple married and opened their restaurant in 1994 , with Tony running the kitchen and Jolynne handling the business side . Together , they 've created one of the best restaurants on the coast . Dave and I love Tony 's fried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . The Trapanis offer fresh seafood , salads , pasta , and other specialties of the house , all with Tony 's creative spin . Their decadent desserts are surely a sin . We suggest ordering the Dinwiddie Deluxe-but loosen your belt ( and call Weight Watchers to ask forgiveness ) first . It involves ice cream , amaretto , and toasted almonds , plus some other ooey-gooey fabulous stuff . Next we headed to Main Street , where a group of artists shares studio space , sends each other customers , and works to bring back the heart of Bay Saint Louis . This street helps host the monthly Second Saturday Artwalk . One of our favorite stops is Maggie May 's , a beautiful gallery named after a stray dog that owners Dave Moynan and John Brennan adopted years ago . They share their large gallery space with six other artists who lost their studios to the storm . Their neighbors down the street , The Artists of 220 Main , are another cooperative . Together these two groups offer everything from beautiful paintings , sculpture , jewelry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , most all of it inspired by the coast . While on Main , we also had fun browsing the Social Chair , Bay Books , Deborah Kennedy Jewelry Designs , and more . I ducked in the Mockingbird Cafe to admire my purchases over an enormous latte-which gave me time to persuade Dave that we needed to swing by the Depot District on our way out of town for more retail therapy . Hello , NOLA ! Coming back to New Orleans after a long absence is like getting reacquainted with an old friend-a vibrant , stylish , irreverent , food-loving , foot-stomping , good-times-rolling friend . From the unapologetic bawdiness of Bourbon Street to the elegant grace of Royal , the French Quarter packs amazing variety into a single neighborhood . For our first trip back , we decided to try one of the smaller , older hotels in the Quarter , Maison Dupuy , where we found a comfy room , a pretty courtyard pool , and an incredibly friendly staff at a great price . As a bonus , the hotel 's on Toulouse , so a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the French Quarter . Because escaping the hustle-bustle of the workaday world is part of any vacation for us , Dave and I like to stay in the Quarter , park the car , grab a good street map , and vacation on foot or by cab . That 's definitely the way to go in New Orleans while areas outside the Quarter continue to rebuild . You can also catch a flight or take Amtrak and cab your way to Big Easy fun . After settling in , we made the obligatory pilgrimage to Bourbon Street . The sing-along at Pat O'Brien 's Bar is in full swing again , and it 's only a matter of time before somebody requests " You Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me , Lucille . " The wrought iron balconies on Royal drip with ferns and flowers , a sight so amazing that even the most focused shopper has to tear herself away from the art and antiques long enough to take it in . Then there 's the food . Mercy . Emeril 's , Brennan 's , Bacco , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Commander 's Palace , Galatoire's-the French Quarter 's and Garden District 's classic restaurants are serving up some of the most incredible dining experiences imaginable . Even the down-home food in New Orleans is fabulous . Locals and tourists alike flock to Central Grocery Company , home of the original muffuletta , and Mother 's , where the jambalaya is worth going up a jean size . Dave and I found a new favorite , Irene 's Cuisine , on St. Philip . The Filet Mediterranean ( $32-$33 ) and the Chicken Rose Marino ( $18 ) - plus everything on the dessert menu-were among our favorites . Irene 's is the perfect combination : fine food in an elegant setting that makes dinner an event , yet the restaurant is n't the least bit pretentious or stuffy . Executive chef Nicholas Scalco learned the ropes by washing dishes and waiting tables for his mom , " Miss Irene " DiPietro . After finishing culinary school , he went to Italy to study . " When I got back , my mom said , " Now forget everything they told you-I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Nicholas said with a grin . We thanked the folks at Irene 's and headed back to our hotel , stopping along the way to check out places we 'd like to try on our next visit . Definitely Hotel Royal , a small , tucked-away inn that we stumbled onto . My friend Mark loves hotel Provincial , so that 's on our list too . Wish we 'd had more time for Caf Du Monde and a swamp tour and the zoo and aquarium , and a ride on the steamboat Natchez and .... Sidebar We just had to get back . My husband , Dave , and I could feel the pull of that very special coastline that marks the end of Old Man River 's ramble to the Gulf . It wraps around Louisiana and Mississippi like a ribbon of live oaks , shrimpboats , and colorful towns . We knew it would be different after Katrina , and it is . Now and then , we had to take a moment just to grasp the dramatic changes around us . Still , as our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their new town motto , " It 's all good . " They 're right too . Focused on the future , the people of the Gulf Coast are making it a land of promise . For travelers , it 's also a land of fun and adventure . - VALERIE FRASER LUESSE Enjoy great food and a view of downtown Hattiesburg on Brownstone 's upper terrace .

Sidebar Mississippi Travel Tip Two bridges on U.S. 90 are still under construction , so you 'll need to take 1-10 to reach Bay Saint Louis or Ocean Springs from all coastal points between these two towns .

Jacqueline typifies the spirit of Cajun Country . These folks love to cook for people who love to eat . Dave and I started our boudin sweep in Prairieville , Louisiana , near Baton Rouge , where we had an amazing breakfast at Frank 's Restaurant &; Smokehouse . Then we made our way to a down-home restaurant called Thibodeaux 's in Duson , just outside of Lafayette , where we could 've eaten a No. 3 washtub full of the potato salad , and the seafood gumbo held a good day 's catch smothered in a chocolate-brown roux .

Bama Bayou , a development across the waterway from The Wharf , plans a full water park , dolphin swims , a resort and conference center , and more . Lulu 's , the recently relocated restaurant owned by Jimmy Buffet 's sister , serves fish sandwiches and shrimp in a setting that resembles a cross between Disneyland and a Florida Keys hideaway .
