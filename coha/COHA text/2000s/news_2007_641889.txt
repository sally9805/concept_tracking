<p> Former Gov . George Ryan , 74 , stood defiantly in front of his Kankakee home Tuesday night in the chilly air and declared his innocence after his last bid to stay out of prison failed . <p> " I will report to the federal corrections facility in Oxford , Wisconsin , as ordered . . . but I do so with a clear conscience and I have said since the beginning of this 10-year ordeal that I 'm innocent and I intend to prove it . " <p> Ryan gained worldwide attention for emptying Illinois ' Death Row in his last days in office , and he signaled a kinship Tuesday night with the allegedly wrongfully accused prisoners of the world . <p> " I 've been fortunate to have at my disposal the finest legal team in the country in Winston &; Strawn , " Ryan said , surrounded by his family . " However , there are many less fortunate , with fewer means than I have , still fighting for justice . " <p> Ryan has enjoyed an extraordinary run of postponements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was convicted of fraud for diverting state money and contracts to his family and friends , including co-defendant Larry Warner , who is to report to prison in Colorado today . <p> LOST LAST CHANCE AT BAIL <p> Ryan and Warner 's last shot would have been for U.S. Supreme Court Justice John Paul Stevens to extend bail , but Stevens on Tuesday morning said " no " to that request . " We knew the petition for bail was a long shot , " said Ryan 's lawyer , former Gov . Jim Thompson of Winston &; Strawn . <p> Today , Thompson 's driver will pick up Ryan and members of his family and take them up to Oxford penitentiary , near the Wisconsin Dells . Thompson was the U.S. attorney who fought to put politicians  --  former Gov . Otto Kerner for example  --  in prison . This is the first time he will be driving to prison to drop off a client . <p> " George Ryan is my client , " Thompson said . " He has also been my friend for 30 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in trouble . " <p> Ryan 's family will be able to visit him only every other week or so . <p> Ryan praised his family for their support through this ordeal , pointing out his son and daughters , his sister and brother , and pulling his wife , Lura Lynn , close to him . <p> " I especially want to thank my wonderful wife right here of 41 years , my high school sweetheart , " he said , then corrected himself , " Nope , sorry , 51 years . Fifty-one years we were married this year . " <p> His family and friends ' cars were parked in the driveway  --  a Lexus SUV ; a Lincoln Town Car , a Cadillac Escalade  --  all with personalized , low-digit license plates  --  part of the package of perks he was convicted of handing out as governor and secretary of state . <p> Actor Mike Farrell of " MASH " fame , a fan of Ryan for his work on the death penalty , called the case against Ryan " disgraceful " and said he hoped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that somehow Gov . Ryan was a rich man because he was steering contracts to friends , " Farrell said . " The fact is he does n't have any money . The only money he had was his pension , and that 's been cut off . He did n't have any money to pay the defense team and , thank God , they did it pro bono . He probably does n't want me to tell you this , but he could n't afford to keep two health insurance policies , and his wife is in poor health , so he let his go so his wife could continue to get health insurance . " <p> ' NO REASON HE CA N'T MOP FLOOR ' <p> Thursday will be the 13th anniversary of the death of six children of the Rev. Scott and Janet Willis in an accident caused by a driver who got his license with a bribe during Ryan 's tenure as secretary of state . The Willises issued a statement saying they believed justice has prevailed . <p> " The Willis children have been deprived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power . " They 're not alone . Other people died or have been seriously injured as a result of this license-for-bribes scandal . George Ryan is still around . His family can still visit him . " <p> Will Thompson ask President Bush to pardon Ryan ? Thompson did n't promise not to ask but said Bush has only granted one so far , and pardons usually come years after sentences have been served . " I do n't think there 's much of a prospect for presidential pardons , " he said . <p> The only item Ryan will be able to take with him to prison is his wedding ring , Thompson said . The prison has no pharmacy , so Ryan , a former pharmacist , will be assigned some other job , Thompson said . <p> " There 's no reason he ca n't mop the floor , sweep the hallway or clean the toilets or do whatever else , " Thompson said . <p> IN GEORGE 'S WORDS <p> Former Gov . George Ryan 's statement Tuesday to the public ( and the reporters camped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope you enjoyed your night here last night . I think at four o'clock this morning I saw somebody sitting out here . If you'da knocked on the door , I 'd probably 've given you a cup of coffee . <p> But as you may know , I have received word today that Justice Stevens has denied my request to postpone my sentence while my appeal is pending before the United States Supreme Court . Needless to say , I 'm disappointed . <p> I want to speak to the citizens of this state who returned me to office for close to 40 years . I 've been silent for a long time based on the advice from my attorney . And I 'm going to pretty much stay that way , except for this statement tonight . I felt obligated to talk to the people that returned me to office for over 40 years . <p> I regret that 's the circumstances that bring me here tonight . It would have been easy over the course of these years to fold under the unrelenting pressure and enter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of pain . But such a plea would just not have been truthful . To the people of Illinois , I 'm not blind to the sentiment that some hold . But I want you to know that I did my best . <p> I want to thank my friends and the many people who have expressed their support with kind words and gestures over these many difficult times and years . I especially want to thank my friends here in Kankakee that supported me since the first day I ever ran for public office . And I especially want to thank my wonderful wife right here of 41 years , my high school sweetheart  --  nope , sorry , 51 years . Fifty-one years we were married this year . Lura Lynn , my children , my oldest , Nancy , Lynda , Julie , Joanne , Jeanette , my youngest , my son , George Jr. , their families . My brother Tom and his wife , my sister Katie , and the rest of my extended family . Their undying support and their love has kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good friends , Jim Thompson and Dan Webb , and the team that they put together at Winston &; Strawn  --  Brad Lerman , Tim Rooney , Julie Bauer and Ray Mitchell . And from the DePaul Center for Wrongful Convictions , the lady that sat by my side during the trial , Andrea Lyon . I want to thank from the Northwestern Center for Wrongful Convictions a woman that helped me a lot , Jennifer Linzer . <p> I 've been fortunate to have at my disposal the finest legal team in the country in Winston &; Strawn . However , there are many less fortunate with fewer means than I have still fighting for justice . <p> Tomorrow , I embark on a new journey in my life . I do so with a firm faith in God and the support and faith of my family . <p> We 're gon na continue our fight . And I will report to the federal corrections facility in Oxford , Wis. , as ordered tomorrow morning . But I do so with a clear conscience . And I have said since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I intend to prove that .
