Nigel Bevelstoke , better known as Turner to all who cared to court his favor , knew a great many things . He knew how to read Latin and Greek , and he knew how to seduce a woman in French and Italian . He knew how to shoot a moving target while atop a moving horse , and he knew exactly how much he could drink before surrendering his dignity . He could throw a punch or fence with a master , and he could do them both while reciting Shakespeare or Donne . In short , he knew everything a gentleman ought to know , and , by all accounts , he 'd excelled in every area . People looked at him . People looked up to him . But nothing-not one second of his prominent and privileged life-had prepared him for this moment . And never had he felt the weight of watchful eyes so much as now , as he stepped forward and tossed a clump of dirt on the coffin of his wife . I 'm so sorry , people kept saying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all the while , Turner could not help but wonder if God might smite him down , because all he could think was-I 'm not . Ah , Leticia . He had quite a lot to thank her for . Let 's see , where to start ? There was the loss of his reputation , of course . The devil only knew how many people were aware that he 'd beencuckolded . Repeatedly . Then there was the loss of his innocence . It was difficult to recall now , but he had once given mankind the benefit of the doubt . He had , on the whole , believed the best of people-that if he treated others with honor and respect , they would do the same unto him . And then there was the loss of his soul . Because as he stepped back , clasping his hands stiffly behind him as he listened to the priest commit Leticia 's body to the ground , he could not escape the fact that he had wished for this . He had wanted to be rid of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Such a pity , " someone behind him whispered . Turner 's jaw twitched . This was not a pity . It was a farce . And now he would spend the next year wearing black for a woman who had come to him carrying another man 's child . She had bewitched him , teased him until he could think of nothing but the possession of her . She had said she loved him , and she had smiled with sweet innocence and delight when he had avowed his devotion and pledged his soul . She had been his dream . And then she had been his nightmare . She 'd lost that baby , the one that had prompted their marriage . The father had been some Italian count , or at least that 's what she 'd said . He was married , or unsuitable , or maybe both . Turner had been prepared to forgive her ; everyone made mistakes , and had n't he , too , wanted to seduce her before their wedding night ? But Leticia had not wanted his love . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the heady rush of satisfaction when yet another man fell under her spell . Turner wondered if she 'd felt that when he 'd succumbed . Or maybe it had just been relief . She 'd been three months along by the time they married . She had n't much time to spare . And now here she was . Or rather , there she was . Turner was n't precisely sure which locational pronoun was more accurate for a lifeless body in the ground . Whichever . He was only sorry that she would spend her eternity in his ground , resting among the Bevelstokes of days gone by . Her stone would bear his name , and in a hundred years , someone would gaze upon the etchings in the granite and think she must have been a fine lady , and what a tragedy that she 'd been taken so young . Turner looked up at the priest . He was a youngish fellow , new to the parish and by all accounts , still convinced that he could make the world a better place . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he looked up at the man who was meant to be the bereaved widower . Ah yes , Turner thought acerbically , that would be me . " Dust to dust . " Behind him , someone actually sniffled . And the priest , his blue eyes bright with that appallingly misplaced glimmer of sympathy , kept on talking- " In the sure and certain hope of the Resurrection- " Good God . " - to eternal life . " The priest looked at Turner and actually flinched . Turner wondered what , exactly , he 'd seen in his face . Nothing good , that much was clear . There was a chorus of amens , and then the service was over . Everyone looked at the priest , and then everyone looked at Turner , and then everyone looked at the priest clasping Turner 's hands in his own as he said , " She will be missed . " " Not , " Turner bit off , " by me . " I ca n't believe he said that . Miranda looked down at the words she 'd just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteenth journal , but this was the first time-the first time since that fateful day nine years earlier-that she had not a clue what to write .

Spent much of the time staring out the window . Ate lunch : fish , bread , peas . Conjugated Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roast , potatoes , pudding . Brought tragedy to the table ( book , not event ) .
