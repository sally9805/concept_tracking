" IN LAR'SZ " TRADITIONAL society , " said the alien , " a lady would often be buried with her husband . A rather beautiful custom , do n't you think ? " The Active Complement of the interstellar freighter stared at him , slightly alarmed . Their companion , the illustrious " passenger " who had elected to share their vigil , liked to play games with their expectations . They never knew when he was joking . Humor glinted in Sigurt 's black eyes - sharply diamond-shaped as to the rims , a curious and attractive difference from the Blue Planet oval . " No , no ! Not buried alive . Not like that , not at all . She would live in the tomb : she would retire there of her own free will , to spend the rest of her days in peace and solitude . " He reached a claw-like fingernail to scratch his ear . " Lar'sz " nobles and peasants continued the practice well into historical times . It 's the sons of the soil and the owners of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? And the dispossessed , of course . Refugees . " They were gathered in the mess : seven Blue Planet humans , vital components in the freighter 's wetware : plus one celebrated alien archaeologist . The hold was laden with precious ancient artifacts from Sigurt 's World , on their way to an exhibition . The Cultural Ambassadors and their staff were making the crossing in dreamtime , but this black-eyed , shadow-skinned , graceful creature preferred activity . They were not clear - they were n't good at reading the small print - whether " Sigurt " was a generic name , or whether their archaeologist was also the actual " Sigurt " who had made first contact . None of them had yet dared to ask him . It was a pleasant , low-ceilinged saloon , decorated in silver and green , the traditional color scheme of the young culture of interstellar transport . Light gleamed from above like sunlight through leaves , the floor had the effects of grass and mosses . They sat around a blond wood table , actually extruded ceramic fiber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sweet , the whole impression was as if they were in a roomy tent , a pavilion pitched in sunny woodland , somewhere in the Blue Planet 's beautiful temperate zones . But outdoors the blizzard raged , pitiless , unimaginable . The hum of the torus was never-ending ; they no longer heard it . And if it ever stopped , that deep subliminal murmur , they would not have time to notice it was gone . The Active Complement had just found out - Panfilo Nube , Payload Officer , had discovered the small print of the manifest , in an idle moment - that one of the pieces in the hold was supposed to be haunted . It was a tomb , but the ghost was not the official owner , so to speak . It was something called a " Tomb Wife , " some kind of ghoul associated with tombs in Lar'sz " culture . Nadeem , the moody , black-browed Homeostat Commissar , had asked Sigurt - half joking - was this spook definitely dead ? They did n't know much , but they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-lived , with a propensity for long comas when times were hard . Sigurt had answered cheerfully that one could not be absolutely sure ; and hence the explanation . " A Tomb Wife did not provide for herself , you see , " he continued . " She was a hermit , a sadhu . " He smiled at Nadeem , who did not smile back . " Her family or her servants would supply food and necessities , but they never saw her . Among the peasantry of course the widow simply went to live in the graveyard , in full view of her neighbors . Her exclusion from society was formal , ritual .... " Rafael , the young Assistant Navigator , frowned uneasily . " But how can you say you 're not absolutely sure she 's dead ? The relics down there are thousands of years old , are n't they ? I do n't mind , I 'd just like to know . A ghost is cool , but a thing that lives in a tomb and is n't dead , well - " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Nobody laughed . Rafe suffered from transit nightmares , an affliction as crippling as seasickness-but it did n't affect his efficiency , or his passion for this strange ocean . " I think we can assume she 's dead , " said the mischievous alien . " In the records of Tene'Lar'sznh , the royal house to which this princess belonged , it 's noted that the food-offerings first went untouched about fifteen hundred years ago , our time . That 's about four thousand of Blue years , I think ? " The Active Complement nodded hurriedly , in unison . Vast timescales made them nervous . A little less , thought Elen , the Navigator . She was intimately aware of the relation between a Blue Planet " year " and the same period for Sigurt 's planet ; as she was aware of every detail of the impossible equations of this journey . She wanted to put Sigurt right , but how would she reach the end of that sentence ? But when , in what relation , at what particular moment ? She closed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " she repeated . " And that 's how they knew ? So , what did they do , when a Tomb Wife 's food'went untouched ' ? " " Nothing at all . " Sigurt 's pointed teeth flashed : the modified aggression of a grin , which seemed to be a constant of humanoid life . " How quick of you , Elen , you 're exactly right . A lady of rank did not allow herself to be seen , once she 'd taken up residence . Her servants or family would continue to supply her needs , but they were forbidden , by the lady 's own will and testament , to go looking for her , and the tomb could be a large and complex building . Nobody would know when , precisely , the offerings became offerings to the dead . " He paused . " Is n't that beautiful ? After a year - or thereabouts , depending on the liturgical calendar - the undertakers were allowed inside . The lady 's remains would be found and there 'd be a funeral . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has it that no remains were ever recovered . And that is how this particular tomb became known as " haunted . ' " " She probably legged it one dark night , " decided Rafe , with relief : and then blushed . " Uh , sorry if that 's a poor taste idea , Sigurt , no offense . " " None taken . " " Are n't you a Lar'sz'ian , Sigurt ? " wondered Carter , the burly ship 's doctor , who wore the captain 's armband . " Larziote , Larzy-ite , however you say it ? " Carter was one of those people who have to assert themselves in the presence of celebrity or renown . He had a horror of showing deference to anything or anyone . For a moment the alien bristled , a startled double-take of affront , thought Elen ( although she could n't be sure ) . The Lar'sz " were now ( when is now , where is now ? ) an impoverished , short-lived remnant . The famous tombs , temples , ruins , were scattered over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like telling a Brazilian you 'd thought he was Portugese . " My family has Tene'Lar't ancestry , but it 's a long way back . " Nadeem the Commissar shifted in his recollection of a birchwood chair : restless with thoughts he knew nobody shared . " Why do you say " Tomb Wife , " Sigurt ? Why a lady ? You beings do n't have our two biological sexes . " Nadeem was a Diaspora-denier . He would bore the socks off you explaining , interminably , how actually there was 120 uncontroversial evidence that all planetary variants on the sentient biped model , all the possessors of " numinous intelligence , " capable of interstellar transit , were descended from a single species . He passionately refused to accept that the original species had been a hominid from the Blue Planet - a precursor of Homo sapiens who had flourished and vanished , leaving only the faintest and most puzzling of traces . It 's only a theory , he 'd insist . And yet the man was a scientist . You had to excuse him ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other 's foibles . Sigurt shared this trait , or he could not have joined them ) . You had to remind yourself that believing that the Earth was the center of the cosmos had once been good science and sound common sense , and many eminent scientists had clung to the old model , long after the new facts arrived . Diaspora-deniers favored the term " beings . " They thought it made them sound rational and agnostic ; which it did not . The rest of the Actives called their illustrious friend an alien , without embarrassment , because at home alien had become a term for the much-loved human practice of bodymorphing , and they 'd forgotten it might be offensive . Sigurt did n't seem to mind . He called them " Blues . " He was not just eminent , he was an original , a Blue Planetophile . His skill in " Blue " languages had not been acquired for the sake of this trip ; it was his hobby in real life . He had no trouble dealing with Nadeem . " Ah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows , which were commas of black velvet , the same texture as the close mat of hair ( or fur ) that covered his skull and extended down his neck and across his shoulders , glimpsed at the throat of his ship-issue green jumper . " Let me think . No , I 'm sure " wife " is correct . The wife is the one who remains , who can not tear herself away . This is social gender , not biology . " Nadeem was not satisfied . Ideally , he explained , all self-respecting other beings , when speaking human language , should call themselves it Elen imagined a dry landscape , a dustbowl sky : parched mounds with small stone markers ( the graves she envisaged were Muslim , somehow ) . The burial ground was sown with sad hunched shapes outside little cardboard shacks ; the villages were depopulated of grandmas . Did the tomb-wives really choose seclusion ? Or were they compelled by the iron hand of custom ? Which nobody inside the rules will ever admit is an oppression . The blizzard outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ match their cargo . But it was whiteness she always imagined " out there . " A white darkness of quantum vacuum . She noticed that Sigurt had said wives , not widows , though his English was very good ; and she wondered about that . They are not the widows of the dead but the wives of the tombs . " Stop kidding yourself , Batman . " Nadeem was getting agitated . " It 's not a one-off planetary evolution that we have in common , it 's time , gravity , hydrogen bonds . It 's an accident of convergent evolution that we look more or less alike . You 've let yourself get sucked in to a cheap , tourist way of thinking , denying your own difference , fantasizing that you can understand us - " " You 're a racist jerk , Nadeem , " responded Sigurt amiably . " Anyway , you just did it yourself . " " What - ? . " The alien raised his arms , spreading the webs between his slender fingers , hooking the air with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ELEN SUITED UP and visited the hold . The float tube delivered her to darkness , where she drifted from one handhold to the next , following track lights to the main cargo compartment . She flooded the great space with air and pressure , touched down as gravity embraced her , took off her helmet , passed through the lock , and walked into a cavern at the roots of a sea-mount . The habitat a green , sunlit island far above The artifacts were crated in force fields , but she could n't adjust the light above art-conservation level . Pedants , she murmured , marveling at the dim , pixelated spectacle . The Lar'sz " part of the collection was the most impressive : so damned impressive you could almost justify the mad expense of the shipping . The haunted tomb was huge , multistoried . It caught her breath . She circled it slowly , calculating that their whole living quarters would easily fit into the Tomb Wife 's portico . There was a single doorway , a black teardrop without a door : set about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carved and inlaid stone . It would be a scramble to get inside . Perhaps the front steps had been left behind , or there was a secret mechanism , something like ancient Egypt . She sat cross-legged , slightly awkward in her suit , gazing . Like most sailors of the strange ocean , she rarely got farther than the dockside when she made landfall . Even if there 'd been more time and less bureaucracy she would n't have been tempted by a lightning tour of Sigurt 's planet . What for ? You 'd see so little . You 'd learn hardly anything . She 'd been interested in the cargo as a professional challenge , a factor in her caculations . The science of transporting massive material objects was in its infancy , and artwork was a nightmare ! But here in the gloom she felt the value of these things . A virtual Lar'sz " tomb , freighted through the transit in a courier 's brain , downloaded into the digital inventories of a limited-release of premier museums , could never have had this presence . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nothing to stop them from breaching the force fields for a preview , without the fuzz . No areas were barred to Active Complement , except the fearsome threshold of the torus itself . She should come back with Sigurt , get him to give her a guided tour . But not the tomb , she thought . If she went into the tomb , she 'd like to do it alone . The image of a dessicated heap of bones and skin , preserved intact , flitted through her mind . The Tomb Wife in a stone room , an old lady fallen down with a broken hip , too proud to cry for help when she heard her servants arriving and departing . But how old was she ? Maybe she was still young when the food offerings " remained untouched . " Sigurt would know . She would ask him . Or better , she 'd look it up herself , and impress him by knowing something . It was probably all in the background files the Complement did n't bother to read . If the practice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Suttee had continued in India long after the Brits tried to stamp it out , had resurfaced even in the Space Age . But it was the haunting that fascinated Elen . Do ghosts travel ? Did pharaohs and Inca sacrifices ever wake up , bewildered , in glass cases , half a world away from home ? Did they wake up in modern times , to find themselves replicated in software ? What about a journey so immense that it has no duration ? What damage would the relativity storm of the blizzard do to something as fragile as spiritual remains ? How embarrassing if the loaned archaeology arrived stripped of its patina and pedigree .... How embarrassing for the fledgling enterprise of interstellar freight , if there should be a Missing Legend incident ! She listened until she was sure she could hear footsteps inside the ziggurat . No , it 's okay , she 's still there , still haunting . Unhurried , peaceful , timeless , the Tomb Wife was going about her quiet routines . Rafe had agonized nightmares in which the Lar'sz " ghl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : seeking live human flesh . Seriously repentant , Sigurt dredged up ( or fabricated ) some potent ancient Lar'sz'ian prayers , which he translated into English phonemes , and taught Rafe to recite . Elen had said nothing about the footsteps in the tomb , but she felt equally responsible . She might have leaked it into the shared reality ; telepathy artifacts were the bane of starfaring . You learned that you had to think no evil of your companions in the matrix , or there would be hell to pay . And do n't imagine spooks , or somebody will get spooked . She did not confess . It would only have made Rafe worse . At the end of a long shift she unplugged herself from the mainframe , meeting as always the adrenaline of panic as she returned to ship-time : clutching at her stomach , icy down her spine . Carter was the captain on this trip , thank God . But Elen was the one who crunched the numbers . She was finally responsible for all the lives on board ( not to mention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worst was knowing that if if ! - she 'd let a transcription error get by , it would not manifest itself until the closing phase . Not until too late . That 's quantum computing , no way around it . The terror of the blizzard engulfed her . No radio , no GPS for this ocean . No ground control for this spaceship , not the slightest possibility of rescue . She saved-off their position meticulously , although off-frame storage was nonsense , no such thing as a Black Box ; and let the solidity of the banks of instruments and winking screens reassure her . The freighter 's official name was Pirate Jenny ( not that Actives themselves bothered much with names of starships ) ; reflecting the Brechtian , Utopian leanings of the parent company , and its financial partner , the World State of Earth . Other ships were the Clement Atlee and the Eleanor Roosevelt . Their sisters were the White Visitation , the Sacred Wicca , the Caer Siddi . Elen decided she preferred the occult strand . No Black Box but this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are doing ; we conjure with monstrous forces , far beyond our control . Footsteps behind her , a breath on the back of her neck , a mocking sigh . " So you got out , " she whispered , and turned slowly , hoping to catch a glimpse of the Tomb Wife 's ghost . Nobody there . She never lets herself be seen They grew accustomed to the extra presence . " I blame myself , " said Sigurt , but in fact the symptom was a common one , technically harmless in terms of neurophysics : believed to be benign by superstitious Actives . Only Rafe was troubled , and he had his prayers . Sigurt told stories . Nadeem the Commissar and the Chief Engineer flirted . The Assistant Navigator , Chief Engineer 's former squeeze , took up with Passenger Liaison . Elen visited the hold again , alone . She 'd decided against the guided tour . In the low light , looking up at that black , balanced teardrop , she fell into a reverie in which the Tomb Wife tradition was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to let go of the past : to decide , so far and no farther . The princess had chosen to stick , as they say in cards , at the grief of loss . To stay with the absence , never to let it fritter away into vague anniversaries , faded rose leaves of memory . Was refusing to let go a feminine trait ? Or was it a Blue trait , which she was cutting and pasting onto the customs of another planet ? It was an Elen trait . She told people ( family , boyfriends , outsiders ) , that she was an interstellar navigator for the adventure of it . The most exotic of exotic travel . But we do not travel , she thought . Not a step . When the transcription is done-what does when mean , where there is no time ? - we will make the crossing in almost zero extension . What we do is stay , in the paradoxical moment Without deliberation she stood up , used her sleeve controls to open the tomb 's force field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit was limber , designed for active wear . A push downward , a bounce up , she had her knee on stone . As she stood up diffuse lighting welled around her . The tomb had been prepared for visitors . She realized , disappointed , that she could n't possibly be the first to enter since the Tomb Wife 's time : probably not even the first Blue ! A short passage led into a stone room , where a table like an altar stood against an inner wall . Above it a life-size mural , in brilliant color , showed two people , same height , same build , sitting opposite each other , informally ; knees up . They both looked like Sigurt , in a generic way . They were gazing at each other , their diamondshaped eyes over-bright , their smiling lips full of sadness . Both had the short cape of black velvet fur . One of them seemed to be wearing a black half-mask . It was this figure who reached to the other , one slender hand outstretched , as if in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an array of diamond-shaped bowls : a curved platter , a heap of dry rags . She looked into the bowls . Dead leaves , granular dust Are the conventions of mourning a universal constant ? Elen thought of Etruscan tombs , Chinese ancestor worship . Her files contained no data , only the vaguest notions , but she was pretty sure that mural was a masterpiece . Her gauntleted hand must have brushed one of the artifacts . A label sprang into existence in the air , explaining - in Sigurt 's planet 's dominant script , in English , and in a third writing she did n't recognize that the actual bowls and platters had been taken away , with their ancient contents . These were replicas . The dry rags were a replica of the decayed set of clothes that had been found The past as theme-park is a universal constant . She explored the stone corridors of the ground floor , paying no further attention to the artwork : ghoulish and hopeful as a child , looking for the bones that had never been discovered . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There were no stairways to the upper floors , and nothing she could identify as living quarters . The artful lighting started to make her feel like a tourist . She took refuge in the gloomiest of the courtyards and sat there looking at another black teardrop , halfway up a wall : quietly visiting the shade of a long-dead " princess . " Immense peace , engulfing spiritual quiet . She listened for footsteps , suddenly terrified . Abruptly she got up and returned to the entrance , dropped to the floor . As she closed the field behind her , embarrassed by her moment of panic in there , a black manta ray swooped across the ocean trench darkness . Elen yelped , and stared around wildly . The shadow cruised again . Her heart was thumping , my God , what is that thing ? What 's in here with me ? " Who 's there- ? " No answer but the hiss of disturbed air . " Hey ! Who 's there ? " Sigurt landed beside her with a soft thump , wrapping slippery folds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , with smiling interest . " So it 's you , Elen . " She stared , appalled : open-mouthed . " My God ! Sigurt ! What d' you think you 're doing ! You ca n't fly ! This is not a game ! " " On the contrary , " said the alien cheerfully . " The whole universe is a game , is it not ? A puzzle-mass of tiny units of information , the pattern of which can be changed at will - given the torus , and the fabulous software implanted in a trained , numinous consciousness . Such as yours , Elen . I 'm not the expert , but is n't that the whole basis of interstellar " navigation ? ' " Elen was shaking with horror . " You ca n't do this ! You ca n't piss around doing impossible things in the transition ! Our lives depend , every f-fucking moment - " " On our conviction that all this is real , " he finished , unrepentant . He showed her the fx controller on his sleeve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I can access a toy from the ship 's library without damaging the equation , ca n't I ? I was just playing . I 'm much lighter than a Blue , and there 's not a great deal of gravity in here . I 've been jumping off the monuments . " She dropped her head in her hands as relief thundered through her , leaving her spent and hollow . Starf arers live in constant terror , like sailors on the ancient oceans . You do n't realize , until you hit a peak , how high the ambient stress is getting " Just for the record , Sigurt , there 's no software , not the way you mean . " " I know that we maintain all this , " he waved a slender hand , shadowpale in the dark . " Between us ... I 've never been quite sure how it 's done . You Blues have all the secrets . Is it true that Starf light Actives have had brain surgery ? " Sigurt 's people had stunning cellular regeneration . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The sciences of surgery and ( worse ! ) gene manipulation had come as a horrible shock to them . Barbarism . " No surgery . No implants . It 's more like a tissue culture . You have to have the right kind of brain to start with . The reason you can be awake is because you 're like us , Sigurt : but you 're a straight , a virgin . We 've had the training that makes us grow the extra neuronal architecture , which does n't , er , exist in normal space - " " Or you would be hydrocephalic Eloi , with heads the size of pumpkins . " She nodded , though she had no idea what an Eloi was . They sat with their knees folded up , like the figures in the mural " I 'm sorry I fooled around , Elen . I scared you . I think I 'm going stir crazy . " " Or else you 're reacting poorly to racist abuse , Batman . " Sigurt laughed , and scratched his ear . " Batman ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my taste . If you like comparisons , we are more akin to frilled lizards than bats . " " Nadeem must really annoy you . " " He is something I would scrape off my shoe , " pronounced the alien , with relish . He tipped back his head . " Do you hear that , Commissar ? Shoe-Scrapings ! " They started to laugh . The Active Complement lived in each other 's heads , accommodating each other as if they 'd been workmates for a lifetime . They were a group mind : inhibited , licensed ; in constant negotiation . Elen replayed the first remark Sigurt had made . Sigurt had known that someone was visiting the artifacts , but because he was only supercargo , not A/C , he had n't known who it was . " I 've been visiting the Tomb Wife , " she said . " I 'm fascinated by the idea of a ghost on an instantaneous transit . Do you know anything more about her ? " The alien shrugged . " Like what ? " The tomb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peered at them from the gloom , carving and shaping blurred into a vague sense of life . " Was she old ? Was she young ... ? Did she have a lover ? " " Widows are a danger to social cohesion , " said the alien . " The relict of a partnership has to be neutralized , or there 'll be msalliances , inheritance disputes . Therefore the widow must marry again , harmlessly . She must wed the tomb - " " That sounds very human . Nadeem would be horrified . " Sigurt seemed to think it over . " The ancient Lar'sz " kept state records , " he said at last . " And accounts . Not much else was written down . I 'm afraid we do n't know much . There are the bas-reliefs , but they 're high art , highly ambiguous . And not of her choosing , of course . They are the memorial her husband ordered . " Elen wanted to ask what was her name , but she was afraid that might be a lapse in taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Is it right to call her a ghost ? Or did a haunting mean something different to the ancient Lar'sz ' ? " " It 's different and it 's the same , of course . " The constant cry of one numinously intelligent sentient biped to another . Sigurt grinned , acknowledging the problem . " Let me try to bridge the gap . In my world we believe that people can , how can I put it , leave themselves behind at certain junctures , life events . Someone else goes on . When we speak of a haunting , that 's our derivation . Not the , er , spirit of someone physically dead . D' you see ? " " Yes , " said Elen , startled and moved . " Yes , I think I do . " She felt that she knew Sigurt better , after this conversation . There was a bond between them , the celebrated archaeologist and the navigator : unexpected but real . THE COUNTRY of no duration ca n't be seen from the outside . You can never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what happened . Everything that " happened " in a transit was doomed to vanish like a dream when they fell back into normal space . As the Pirate Jenny moved , without motion , to the end , without ending , of the paradoxical moment , everyone had a terrible psychic headache . The Active Complement suffered fretful agonies that swamped the ghost , Rafe 's nightmares ; all their shipboard entanglements . They regarded Sigurt , whose wakefulness was part of their burden , not so much as an exciting famous person , more as a demanding pet . Batman 's favorite expression ( of course ! ) set everybody 's teeth on edge . The captain had been interstellar crew for as long as there 'd been commercial interstellar traffic , and he could see the writing on the wall . " The Pirate Jenny is a horseless carriage , " he moaned , in mourning for the sunlit green walls , the mossy ground , the polished birchwood . " Soon it will all be gone , all this . Nobody will bother . Passengers will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shut up , " muttered Elen , " shut up , shut up , I 'm trying to concentrate - " She was mortally afraid that she 'd made a mistake . She scoured the code for a single trace of the ghost ( there must be a trace ! ) found none , and knew she must have missed something . Mistake , mistake . The insensate , visceral memory that she always felt like this in the closing phase was no comfort at all . " What about freight ? " Gorgeous Simone , Chief Engineer , looked up from a game of solitaire . " Who 's going to carry the freight , doctor ? Hump it through the indefinite void , if not people like us ? Fuck , look at the size of that problem . " " Swearbox , " piped Rafe , who had grown chirpy while the others grew morose , and was now a rock , a shoal , an infuriating danger to shipping . " Go and eat your head . " " They 'll paint the crates with essence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some crazy Borgs will break the Convention . They 'll create actual supernuminal " Artificial Intelligence " nanotech , and inject it into matter . " " So fucking what . You wo n't be redundant , you 're a doctor . " " Ooops ! Swearbox again ! " " Does not compute , man ! If it 's a true AI , it 'll have civil rights and they wo n't be able to make it do anything . We 'll unionize it , it will be on our side - " The alien laid his black velvet head on his slender arms on the tabletop and sighed , very softly . All seven of them took this as an outrageous insult . They 'd have fallen on Batman and torn him limb from limb , except that they knew there 'd be hell to pay . The navigator quit the saloon and retired to her section . God , let this be the peak . Let us be over the mountain , this is unbearable . They were over the mountain . Elen reported their position , news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing for her to do but watch the tumblers fall : watch the numbers cascade into resolution , not a phase-point out of place . She loved this part and hated it She went down to the hold to visit the Tomb Wife , for the last time . There was a rumor that they 'd all be given free passes for the Exhibition , but she did n't think she 'd go . The relationship had been formed here , in the dim-lit cavern under a sea-mount . It would n't be the same in normal space . The tomb greeted her with its shimmering silence , with the stillness of a grief embraced ; set in stone . " Hello ? " she whispered . " I think I 'm here to say good-bye . " She was not surprised when Sigurt joined her . They smiled at each other and sat for a while ; but the black teardrop beckoned . The alien succumbed first . He hooked his long fingers into twin curves in the carving that she had n't noticed , and was through the doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought Elen . The entrance is supposed to be like that . She tried to copy his action but could n't find the handholds . She had to make the same scrambling jump as before ; and followed him to the chamber where the partners faced each other , the " wife " poised forever in that gesture of farewell . Emotion recorded in art was the rosetta stone , the only ( and frequently deceptive ) common language of the Diaspora . Elen was n't sure what a rosetta stone had been , originally . Sigurt would probably know . But she felt she understood the message of that unfinished caress ; the speech in those bright , half-hidden eyes . The dead are gone . The Tomb Wife stayed with herself . She stayed with the life that had ended , rather than going on , a different person How strange , how beautiful . Sigurt had gone farther into the tomb . At length she heard him coming back . She did n't have to look around , she could clearly picture him leaning in the ancient doorway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no duration . As often as she left this homeland and woke into forgetfulness , she never got used to the wrench of parting . Oh , she thought . I need not leave . I can stay . If I had n't taken this berth , if I had never met Sigurt , I would never have realized that I could do this ! With a rush of immense gratitude toward the alien , she knelt , she crept on her knees to the offertory table and settled there , curled against the stone . " The Tomb Wife was obliged to remain , " said the archaeologist , behind her , in a tone of mild apology . " For all eternity , with the partner to whom she was bound .

The sentient bipeds barely knew anything about each other , as yet . Misconceptions abounded , wild mistakes were only found out when it was too late . A family divided by a single language , thought Elen : knowing at the same time that everything , the stone against her cheek , Batman 's deception , was a translation , and really there was only the blizzard . Yet in the last paradoxical moment , annoyed that it had to happen , that she would not stay here entirely , she felt herself splitting , giving birth to the person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sigurt , arm in arm : glimpsed , through the veil of Elen the Navigator 's physical form , the Tomb Wife 's caped shoulders , the delicate black domino of velvet fur , the gleam of the lovers " eyes .
