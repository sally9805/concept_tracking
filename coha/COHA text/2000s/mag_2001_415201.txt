At thirty-five , the posh , pioneering countryhouse hotel on England 's southwest coast is an Anglophile 's dream . It 's an English idyll , the scene at Chewton Glen this summer Sunday afternoon . Lunch has been served , checkout time has come and gone and still the flagstone terrace that runs along one side of the hotel 's gabled , ivy-and-wisteria  --  covered facade is dotted with weekend guests reluctant to stir from their tables and head for the M3 expressway . Here and there , couples read their newspapers in silence , or doze in the soft sun , or flirt in the shade of awning  --  striped umbrellas . Others just let their gazes roam over the candy-colored border of petunias and geraniums at the terrace 's edge , to the view of the grounds beyond it . There , on the perfect flat of a perfectly green croquet lawn , boys in blazers and girls in dresses with silk ribbons trailing down the back are idly knocking balls through wickets and waiting for their parents . In the distance , a lone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon of trees his only background . Photograph Right this way ? Chewton Glen 's raspberry-colored foyer offers guests a warm welcome-and Wellingtons , too , to borrow for walks around the pastoral 120-acre property . // We all have that one place in the world we love more than any other . Maybe it 's a place where we actually did once fall in love , or maybe it 's a place where we feel more at home than we do when we really are at home . For me that place is England , so it 's no wonder that before I 've even checked in , while I 'm waiting just a few minutes on the terrace for my room to be ready , I 'm already hooked on Chewton Glen . Climbing ivy rustling in the whispering breeze , an elderly woman slowly leading her white-haired brother down a path to admire the " busy Lizzies " ( impatiens , it turns out ) , young waiters in bow ties and crisp suits offering saucer-size strawberries and glasses of Champagne ... I admit that as an Anglophile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scenes , but really-how could anyone resist this ? The short version of the Chewton Glen story is easy . Originally a modest manor house , it was built in Hampshire , just inland from the English Channel , in the mid-1700s . In time , the house passed through a number of owners , was expanded and remodeled along Palladian lines , and by the 1960s , attempts were being made to turn it into a small hotel . Enter , in 1966 , a young man named Martin Skan , who was looking to do something on his own after a stint in the confectionery business . After acquiring Chewton Glen , he **29;339;TOOLONG others had failed , turning the place into the elegant hostelry that it is today and doing so years before country-house hotels became fashionable . Now in his thirty-fifth year as proprietor , Skan has expanded Chewton Glen 's guest rooms from 8 to 62 , its grounds from 30 acres to 120 and its staff from 6 to 200 . Today his establishment is a member of the Relais &; Chateaux luxury hotels group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include indoor and outdoor pools , a health club , a spa , four tennis courts ( including two indoors ) and a nine-hole , par-three golf course . And the rave reviews for Skan , his Swiss-born co  --  proprietor and wife , Brigitte ( who oversees the hotel 's interior design ) , and their managing director , Peter Crome ( ex-manager of London 's Savoy Hotel ) , keep rolling in . Chewton Glen was voted the number-one hotel in Europe by readers of the English edition of Conde Nast Traveler in 1998 , best U.K. hotel outside London by hotel and restaurant critic Michael Winner in 1999 , and best country-house hotel in the world by Gourmet readers in 2000 . In its January 2001 issue , The Gallivanter 's Guide , a newsletter for discerning luxury-travel aficionados , wrote that for small hotels , Chewton Glen " is the star of the UK . " But the short story does n't tell the real story of Chewton Glen , which , more than the accolades , is why you 'll want to go . Through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bridge and up to a flower-rimmed circular courtyard-from the start , Chewton Glen is beautiful and impressive without being showy . Once you 're inside the front door , the decor  --  overstuffed furniture , fine carpets , good paintings and fresh flowers-lives up to the proper , country-house look of the exterior , but the atmosphere , while formal , is not fussy . In the raspberry-colored foyer , for instance , a grand , claw-footed gilt-framed mirror hangs over a row of ordinary Wellingtons , put out for guests to borrow for walks during their stay . Photograph // To the left of the reception area are three rooms used as lounges , the middle and largest one done in softly faded yellows and florals . Library tables are piled with magazines , and on two sides there are arched floor-to-ceiling windows with views of the lawns and terrace . There 's a grand piano , too , for music on special occasions . Straight ahead from the reception area and on the left , you come to a nook-filled bar in cozy reds and , across the corridor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rooms , the last being the most dramatic . A long , narrow and minimally furnished glass conservatory , it pairs white-clothed tables on a terra-cotta floor with arcs of white fabric that billow down from the ceiling . At night , with the candles on the tables faintly illuminating the darkness of the garden outside , this is surely one of the most romantic dining rooms in England . Above and beyond this ground-floor core are the accommodations , which are variously located in the Old House ( along with the lobby , restaurant and lounges ) , the Garden Wing ( added in 1972 ) , the Coach House Wing ( converted in 1980 ) and the Croquet Lawn Wing ( added in 1990 ) . Because of the additions and the way they emanate from the Old House , finding your way can be complicated-corridors can go up a few steps here , down a half-level there  --  which adds to the feeling of being in a rambling private house . The names of the rooms are no help , either . Parts of a well-known British children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were written in the house in the 1840s by sea captain Frederick Marryat , so guests now stay in lodgings with such names as " Jacob Faithful , " " The Poacher , " " Patience Heatherstone " and " Ralph Restless " - all taken from Captain Marryat 's characters and poems . The names are n't just a cute touch , though : the real New Forest , a vast , thickly wooded landscape largely undisturbed since the time of the Norman kings , still exists just a few minutes from the hotel . But whether your room is a standard ( there are fortythree ) or a suite ( nineteen ) , each is a cocoon of rich fabrics . Stripes , patterns , chintzes and florals are almost everywhere you look : on the beds , headboards , curtains , swags and table skirts . Amazingly , however , no pattern is used in more than one room ; Brigitte estimates that she has used at least 300 different fabrics throughout the hotel . There 's a crystal decanter of sherry in every room , heated towels in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a profusion of pillows . ( The sofa in my suite had five of them plumped and positioned for instant lounging . ) The majority of the rooms also have terraces or balconies , so that guests have as much opportunity to enjoy views of the lawns as they do views of the decor and , in either case , to appreciate how well the English do comfort when they set their minds to it .

Some realization might come to you during a half-hour walk down to the breezy sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grounds , you reach high cliffs above an arc of a beach , with a view of the Channel and the Isle of Wight 's chalky cliffs in the distance that looks as old as time itself . Or you might sense it just before you drift off to sleep on sheets that go through the hotel 's two massive pressing machines only to emerge , miraculously , as delicate and caressing as Champagne bubbles . But at some point you will know that Chewton Glen superbly serves up the softer side of England-the England of chintzes and crumpets and clotted cream , of the Queen Mother 's reaching 100 and bringing a tear to the eyes of a nation . That 's part of the reason that Chewton Glen is not everyone 's idea of the perfect country-house hotel . For some , it 's too " old-fashioned " ( the word " computer " does not appear in the room guide , even though up-to-date wiring ensures that your laptop will work fine here ) ; for others it 's too perfect and pretty , or not grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deliver the supremely comforting side of England past that has managed to survive in small pockets of England present . Certainly there are powerhouse elements here that will be part of any stay . The dining room in particular comes on strong , offering such dishes as an Emmenthaler cheese souffle with kirsch sauce that is like tasting a delicious cloud , and a lamb fillet so crusted with mustard , herbs and breadcrumbs that it delights four of the five senses . And the wine list ! It boasts more than 400 vintages , many of them connoisseur-class . But overall , the pleasures here are as gentle as they are refined . Altogether they make for travel that takes you not to a new place but , in a sense , to a new person-or , rather , to the person you were before life started taking its toll . And that 's the real story of Chewton Glen . Luxury travel today , whether it 's adventurous ( like temple  --  viewing in Cambodia ) or sybaritic ( like beach-basking in Hawaii ) , is often about getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets you back to yourself by focusing on the quality of the simplest parts of daily life : food , drink , relaxation and sleep . By elevating these basics , it makes you enjoy-and appreciate-them all the more.You find yourself sitting on the terrace for much longer than it takes to have tea or a drink , or reading a book in a corner of a lounge without concern for the time and feeling that it is a rich experience . And it is . Because how often do you feel true contentment and well-being ? Photograph A stately pleasure dome indeed : inside and out , Chewton Glen offers the height of civilized relaxation .

They will admit that they spend almost all their profits on keeping up the property and paying for their never-ending renovations and expansions ; last year , for instance , their building costs were $3 million , which included the creation of twelve new suites in the Coach House Wing . But beyond acknowledging their reinvestment strategy , this impeccably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lauren and Dolce &; Gabbana for her ) like to attribute their success to their staff , especially managing director Peter Crome and such veterans as deputy general manager Giuseppe ( Joe ) Simonini , who has been with the hotel for thirty-four years , and chef Pierre Chevillard , in the restaurant for twenty-two years . Still , one can glimpse a tenet of the Skans ' management style-the power of the personal touch-in the way that either they or Peter Crome seems to be always on site and on duty . Crome 's office looks out over the entrance courtyard , " so I can see all the comings and goings , " he says . And , at six feet six , even when he 's elsewhere-which is much of the time , as " I can only sit still for half an hour at a time " - little escapes his attention . " I 'm one of those people who 's all over the place . My philosophy is and always has been that you should look upon every guest as your most important relation and give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that relative came to your house . " Like Crome , the Skans , too , make it a point to introduce themselves to new customers at drinks or to get up to welcome back longtime clients at dinner . They enjoy spending time at home , half an hour away , and they travel frequently , especially to Switzerland , where they have another residence , but when they are at Chewton Glen , never do they remain in any one place for too long before quietly slipping off , separately or together , to reappear at yet another guest 's side or in another part of the hotel . " We really do n't want people staying just one night , because we do n't get to know them , " says Martin , making it clear that to him , understanding the client is tantamount to serving the client well . More and more luxury travelers , he points out-and especially Americans-tend to " arrive in the afternoon , have dinner , and they 're gone at eight the next morning.We want to tell them about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them-we want to look after them as best as we possibly can .

" When guests do put themselves wholeheartedly in Chewton Glen 's hands , chances are they 'll be well satisfied-and will return again and again . " It 's the most wonderful place we 've ever stayed , " declares Carol Ross , who , having first visited from Los Angeles with her husband , Bruce , in 1999 , came back in 2000 and is planning another visit as well . Not only did she and her husband reserve the top-of-the-line Marryat Suite for their second trip , they 've also , she adds , " told about twenty-five of our closest friends they 've got to go . " Lou and Judi Mezzullo of Richmond , Virginia-two of the Rosses ' circle who 've taken their advice-nod in agreement . " Staying in nice places is our hobby , " says Lou , who estimates that he and his wife have visited between thirty and thirty-five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is the nicest yet .
