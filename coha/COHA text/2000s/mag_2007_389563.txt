Headnote BEFORE OVERDOING IT THIS SPRING , LEARN HOW TO PREPARE YOUR BEDS-AND YOUR BODY-FOR PAIN-FREE GARDENING AND MAXIMUM ENJOYMENT . On a warm , sunny spring morning , you bound out of the house , eager to get busy digging , planting , weeding , and taking all the other steps to getting your garden started for the season . All day you keep at it , standing , stooping , leaning , kneeling , and crouching . The next morning , every muscle aches and you need time to recover before you can even think about gardening again . Even worse if , like so many of us , you are n't as young and limber as you used to be . Does this mean you should give up the pleasures of homegrown tomatoes and fresh-picked bouquets ? Not if you set up your garden to avoid the strain , use smart tools designed to lighten the work , and take time to prepare your body . The gardeners on these pages , photographed in the Chicago Botanic Garden 's Buehler Enabling Garden , face challenging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plots . Apply their insights to your efforts , and take the ache out of gardening . Simple Rules Okay , these may seem pretty obvious to you , if you stop to think about them . The problem is , most of us do n't practice them until after we 're in desperate need of massage therapy just to stand upright . Set attainable goals . We 've all been in this position : On the one weekend you have completely free , you plan to turn the soil and plant all of your spring garden before sundown on Sunday . No matter how you feel by Saturday afternoon . Do n't fall into this trap . Instead , set modest goals for each portion of the day and assess your progress and how you feel every couple of hours . Pace yourself . Remember that story about the tortoise and the hare ? You will work longer and stronger if you go at a task steadily than if you push to finish a big project . Take breaks . Every hour , give yourself 5 minutes to stretch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from your exertion . You 'll more than compensate for those idle 5 minutes with increased productivity during the other 55 minutes of the hour . Place chairs in the shade around your garden so you are reminded to relax in them . Beware of bending and reaching . Physical therapists , chiropractors , and other experts in the field will tell you that you are most vulnerable to injury when you are bending at the waist and reaching . You 're also more prone to losing your balance and falling in this position . If you must bend , do so with your knees rather than your back . And position yourself close enough to your task so that you are not reaching . Even pulling weeds puts more strain on your lower back than you realize . Ask for help . This may be the toughest advice to take when you are determined to make it through your list of chores . But if you have a heavy or awkwardly balanced object to move , get assistance from a friend or neighbor . Whether you are lifting something alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to your body in front to avoid back strain . Oh , My Aching ... Back , knees , neck , hands . All of us are likely to feel sore in these areas after a busy day in the garden . But many gardeners are limited by chronic pain ( even arthritis ) and must avoid putting any strain on their sore spot . If you fall into this category , the ideas on the following pages will help you avoid or at least reduce joint pain . Raise your garden . We almost always recommend growing in raised beds-typically 4 to 8 inches above the ground . But if you ca n't bend or kneel for any length of time , follow the example of the Buehler Enabling Garden , which has beds that are 2 to 3 feet high . Vertical wall gardens or tabletop gardens are a smart option for gardeners who can only work sitting down . Or plant in pots . Vegetables , flowers , even fruit trees grow well in containers , which you can place where they are comfortable for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across , says Buehler Garden director Gene Rothert , to prevent the soil from drying out too quickly . Place the pots on caddies with casters so they 're easy to move . Hang baskets from tree limbs , fence posts , and similar stands , and you have your garden just about at eye level . Cushion your knees . Use a foam-padded knecler ( two make an even better cushion ) or knee pads to prevent knee and backaches when planting seedlings , weeding , cultivating in tight spots , or picking low-growing crops . We 've worn out quite a few kneelers here at OG , and we recommend the kind that flips over to become a seat and has handlebars that help you stand up after you 've been on your knees for a while . Work with long-handled tools . Whether you 're weeding , cultivating , or watering , you stay more upright and can even work sitting down when you do these tasks with tools that have 3- to 4-foot-long handles . But you do n't have to buy a shedful of special new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works well for cultivating , suggests Nancy Chambers of New York 's Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine . Rely on a ratchet . If pain in your hands and fingers makes gardening uncomfortable , use chopsticks to easily open holes for seeds and transplants . For all kinds of pruning jobs , get lightweight ratchet tools ( see " Handy Helpers , " below ) , which increase pressure on branches and limbs with no more effort from you . Switch often . Avoid repetitive-motion injuries by dividing up each task into sections that allow you to switch activities and posture often , advises Teresia Hazcn , Registered Horticultural Therapist and coordinator of the Legacy Therapeutic Gardens in Oregon . For instance , weed one raised bed , then stand up and water it before weeding the next bed . Listen to your body . Professional athletes get paid to play with pain . But you garden because it 's tun ( remind yourself of that next time you are struggling to pull an especially resistant weed ) . When you are hurting , your body is sending you a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ count on completing your to-do list this season , and for years to come . Horticulture as therapy . No favorite activity should be curtailed by the barrier of a physical limitation , especially gardening . The benefits to the mind , body , and spirit are unmatched . Smell , sight , touch , taste , sound-they all come into play in the garden .

Sidebar MASTER 'S TIP Install levers ( rather than round handles ) on gate latches , doors , and water faucets . NEWBIE HINT Keep a few hand tools tucked away in the garden at various locations to save steps . Sidebar Easy does it : A display on the wall of the Buehler Enabling Garden 's toolshed holds tools for demonstrations and for visitors to try out . The soil is organic , so bare hands are used along with PETA helping tools . Gene Rothert , manager of the Enabling Garden and the Chicago Botanic Garden 's horticultural therapy services , swears by his pruner . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quick Warmup Gardening is a strenuous activity , so your body needs to loosen up before you start working it . Take a brisk walk to get your heart pumping and muscles ready to perform . Or try this routine developed for Organic Gardening Barbara Benagh , a Boston yoga instructor . Ideally , Benagh says , start these exercises at least a month before the gardening season begins to strengthen your back and other potential sore spots and improve your balance . Reclining leg stretch . lie on your back with straight legs . Raise one leg 90 degrees from the floor and hold your foot with a strap or your hands . Keep your knee bent if you are unable to raise the leg 90 degrees . Breathe steadily and hold for one minute before releasing . Repeat the exercise with your other leg . Back strengthener . Lie face down with your knees bent and arms at your sides . Breathe in as you raise your head and chest ; breathe out while raising your arms and legs as high as possible . Hold for three breaths before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Standing , join your hands behind your back . Stretch your arms back and up behind you . Breathe in and hinge forward from your hips . Keep your hands clasped and stretch your arms overhead . Hold one minute . Neck and spine stretch . Grip something solid ( like the knobs of a door ) and step back a couple of feet . Slowly hinge backward from your hips until you feel yourself hanging . Adjust your feet to maximize the stretch in your back and shoulders . Hold one minute . Ready , willing , able : Dedicated gardeners work together to maintain the Enabling Garden . A certified occupational therapist uses a rolling seat to work in the raised beds , above . An able-bodied volunteer finds that this Ste padded kneeler lessens knee pain and its side handles help with getting up . Pipe insulation on the handle makes an everyday trowel easy to grip .
