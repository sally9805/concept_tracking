<p> THE IRONY IN THE POPE 'S APPEAL <p> Editor  --  How ironic that the Pope John Paul II asks forgiveness for the intolerance demonstrated by the Roman Catholic Church just days after California voters made Proposition 22 state law . Proposition 22 was rooted in intolerance for gay and lesbian Californians and our families . The church supported the initiative from the pulpits and the pocketbooks of dioceses across the state . <p> Although I was raised Catholic , I worship in a Protestant church where my family and I are valued as an essential part of the spiritual community . Remorsefulness requires actions as well as words . More anti-gay legislation is sure to follow Proposition 22 . It will be interesting to see if the Catholic Church truly deserves the forgiveness it seeks . <p> LAURA STRATTON <p> Oakland <p> APOLOGIES TO COME <p> Editor  --  Now , centuries after the transgressions committed by the Roman Catholics , the pope has apologized for some of the mistakes the church made throughout history . But he failed to apologize for the support afforded the Nazis during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and murdered . Hitler was a Catholic , and his troops were often sprinkled with holy water by the priests . <p> I expect we may hear an apology for that sometime before the end of this millennium . Then the pope can work on an apology to the gays and lesbians that are still demonized and tortured by the church . In only a few thousand years the Catholic Church should be all apologized out . <p> JIM PRATER <p> San Jose <p> SHAMEFUL SALARIES <p> Editor  --  Shame ! Shame ! Shame ! San Francisco school custodians are making more money than the district 's teachers . At our school , we love our custodians and appreciate their hard work . We are also envious that they have such an effective union that gets them a decent wage . But this recent publicity has once again pointed out just how poorly teachers in San Francisco are paid , and we are outraged . <p> Teachers have a responsibility unparalleled by any other profession . As teachers , we are expected to do everything in our power to help children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we spend hundreds of hours doing these jobs beyond our required workday without overtime pay . In addition , we must take extra college courses on our own time and money to keep up with current curriculum and technologies . <p> Salaries in San Francisco range from $31,000 for starting teachers to a maximum of $56,000 for teachers with 25 years or more of experience . Veteran teachers are making $12,000 a year less than other Bay Area instructors . Currently , we have been offered a zero percent raise . We live in one of the most expensive cities in the nation , yet we remain one of the lowest paid . New teachers can not afford to live here . Each year we are losing many talented people who are seeking out better-paying districts . Still others are leaving the profession altogether in order to lift themselves out of poverty . <p> We need to apply pressure to our elected Board of Education to give teachers a substantial raise by writing letters , e-mailing and/or calling each and every member . We must contact Gov . Davis to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the governor thinks that monetary rewards to students will motivate learning , he is quite mistaken . It takes teachers in the classrooms to instill the love for learning by quality teaching . Quality education should be society 's first priority , and San Francisco teacher salaries need to reflect that . <p> JOHN GOUGH <p> San Francisco <p> JOURNALISTIC INTEGRITY <p> Editor  --  As one of the " Weyrich 12 , " ( now over 15 or more ) I hope your readers wo n't be distracted by the red herring policy issues of " gays " and " abortion " that prompted so many to resign from various Weyrich " Gazettes " ( Chronicle , March 7 ) . The core issue was and is the fact that these people put their jobs on the line for a notion most people think is dead : Journalistic integrity and the covenant a " real " newspaper must have with its community . <p> I do n't think the Weyrichs have any comprehension of the extent of the injury they have inflicted on our community . Nor do I think they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride to discover that over a dozen people still believe that good journalism actually matters and is worthy of sacrifice . Imagine that . <p> ANN CALHOUN <p> Los Osos <p> BRAGGING RIGHTS <p> Editor  --  Gov . Bush 's office is putting up a smoke screen when it comes to his environmental record ( Letters , March 8 ) . <p> As a Texan , I want the people of California to know the truth about the environmental problems in our state and how Gov . Bush has failed to clean up the pollution that impacts so many Texans . Let me give you the only number that matters in Texas  --  No. 1 . <p> Texas is No. 1 in toxic air pollution . <p> Texas is No. 1 in toxic releases to the environment . <p> Texas is No. 1 in cancer-causing pollution . <p> Houston has passed Los Angeles as the nation 's smog capital . <p> The Bush campaign brags about a proposed cleanup of air pollution in Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth . The fact is that Texas is only proposing a cleanup because the U.S. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the state if Texas does n't come into compliance with the federal Clean Air Act . <p> The Bush campaign brags that Texas is reducing emissions from older electric power plants as a result of an electric industry restructuring bill signed into law by Gov . Bush . The fact is that the provision reducing emissions from those plants was forced on the governor by the members of a Texas House committee who made it a condition for passing the bill . <p> The Bush campaign brags that industrial air emissions in Texas declined 11 percent and toxic air emissions dropped 20 percent since Gov . Bush has been in office . The fact is that whatever reductions in air emissions occurred were the result of federal Clean Air Act requirements and a program initiated by Gov . Bush 's predecessor , Ann Richards . <p> KEN KRAMER <p> Director , Lone Star Chapter <p> Sierra Club <p> Austin , Texas <p> SHOOTING STANDARDS <p> Editor  --  So it is " irrelevant " that those New York cops killed an innocent man ? Mark Lundin 's outrageous apologia ( Letters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the brotherhood-in-blue mentality is not limited to New York or Los Angeles . <p> Those officers were so focused on seeing a threat that did not exist that they did n't take the time to perceive the actual situation and thus took an innocent human life . We have to have more objective standards than simply letting the police shoot away because of certain stereotypes they harbor . The Diallo tragedy and Lundin 's thoughtless letter should be a wake-up call to reassert full civilian review of police conduct . If this is Monday-morning quarterbacking , then we need more of it . <p> MICHAEL P. HARDESTY <p> Oakland <p> PARENTS BEFORE PCS <p> Editor  --  Jesse Jackson opens an office in East Palo Alto in hopes of bridging " the digital divide . " The governor of Maine wants to give every seventh-grader in his state a laptop computer . <p> Is there any kind of technology handout that would have altered the life of the 6-year-old killer from Michigan ? These kids do n't need PCs and Internet access . They need better parents . <p> ELAINE HAMILL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am writing in regard to a February 14 article , " FDA Stops Tracking Herbal Remedies , " concerning the FDA 's regulation of dietary supplements . <p> The FDA carefully monitors adverse reaction reports concerning dietary supplements . All reports undergo an initial clinical review , and for all serious events , additional information is sought from reports and health-care providers to aid in a proper assessment . This information includes product labeling , use and medical records . These reviews provide the FDA 's Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition with " signals " of potential problems that warrant further evaluation . <p> We also look at the targeted market populations , such as the elderly , pregnant women and children , as well as possible drug interactions and disease states . The FDA considers this monitoring to be crucial and will continue to work to strengthen its reporting systems . <p> JOSEPH A. LEVITT <p> Director , Center for Food Safety <p> and Applied Nutrition <p> Washington , D.C.
