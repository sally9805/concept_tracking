" Miss ? " <p> The passenger in 13C woke up to find the flight attendant lightly shaking her shoulder . <p> " I 'm sorry to disturb you , miss , " the flight attendant said , " but we 're about to land at Kennedy . You 're going to have to return your seat to its upright position . " <p> " Oh ... Yes , of course . " She pushed the button to put her seat back in place . The flight attendant smiled , thanked her , and moved down the aisle . <p> When she was gone , Passenger 13C sifted through her purse for a compact , found it , and flipped it open , inspecting her face in the mirror . She sighed , not liking what she saw in the reflection . These early mornings did n't agree with her . <p> She slipped the compact back in the purse , then reached under the seat in front of her , where her backpack was stowed , and tucked the purse inside it . <p> Then she yawned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and prepared for landing . <p> Henry Lemmon was late . <p> Keeping the speedometer at a steady seven miles per hour above the speed limit , his dark blue 2002 BMW 525i flew down the Van Wyck Expressway . His eyes darted left and right in the dawn sunlight as they searched for police cars . Still , his foot never wavered on the gas pedal , not even when it officially entered the grounds of John F. Kennedy International Airport . <p> He loved driving this car , loved the way it handled as it zipped around banks of aggressive yellow taxis and the awkward movements of civilian automobiles jockeying for position in the crowded roadway . He loved the way he could ease it to the right , then left , then right again , and it never complained ... The way it rode up one ramp and down another , shifted lanes , and did it all over again , threading through the congestion like it was the only car on the road . He loved it so much that he barely remembered he was ultimately in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . <p> In a few years he 'd have his twenty-five in , and then he could retire with a full pension . Maybe , thought Henry Lemmon , he could then sit behind the wheel of his 525i all day , and see where it took him . <p> It was only when he approached the traffic backing up outside Terminal 4-home of TriState Airlines-that he finally slowed , regretfully taking control back from the machine and patting the steering wheel , as if to assure the vehicle that it was nothing personal . <p> After pulling the car into an open space at the far end of the sidewalk adjacent to Arrivals , Henry Lemmon slapped a Suffolk County Sheriff 's Department placard on the dashboard to make sure he would n't be hassled by airport security . Then he slid across to the passenger 's side , let himself out at the curb , and cast an appreciative glance back at the car before briskly walking through the sliding glass doors . <p> Once inside , just past Baggage Claim , he reached into an inside pocket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheet of paper , inspecting his careful lettering one last time as he opened it . <p> ARBOGAST . <p> The sheet of paper unfurled , he held it at chest level and stood at the foot of the escalators , where-at any moment-Amber Arbogast would be descending , fresh from her 6:43 AM flight from Albany . She would see her name and rush into his arms , free at last from the tyranny of her abusive parents , and forever grateful that Henry Lemmon-Deputy Henry Lemmon of the Suffolk County Sheriff 's Department-had been her savior . <p> And then they would be happy together . Happily ever after . <p> True , she was only sixteen years old , but she 'd be seventeen in mere months . And after six weeks of on-line chats and a few brief , furtive phone calls , Henry Lemmon already knew they had a lot in common ... Enough , certainly , to compensate for the twenty-five-year gap between their ages . She would get an education and be free of abuse and thrive ; in return , he would get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for both of them . <p> Best of all , no one had to know the truth ; the neighbors had already been informed that Henry 's wayward , runaway niece was coming to stay with him . The cop as family disciplinarian ... it was the perfect story to deflect suspicion . Clever girl that she was , Amber had come up with that cover . It just went to show how smart she was . He never ceased to be amazed by how damn smart the girl was . <p> And , in an absolute worst-case scenario , sixteen was almost legal . Maybe it was n't normal for a sixteen-year-old girl to be with a forty-one-year-old man who was going to be forty-two in a few weeks , but it was almost legal . And " normal " was in the eyes of the beholder . Or so he told himself . <p> Henry Lemmon smiled , sucked in his sagging belly , held his ARBOGAST sign proudly , and thought how lucky they were to have found each other . At any moment she would be standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was sure of that-sure she 'd be standing there , that was , since he definitely knew she 'd be grateful-because he had checked and knew she had boarded the plane . <p> He had n't wanted to do that-it seemed wrong to doubt his soul mate-but the cop in him made him cautious every now and then . He would have felt like a chump if Amber had n't boarded the plane and had been playing him all along . But she had n't ; she was on that TriState plane . <p> Which , come to think of it , should have emptied its human cargo by now , if not their checked luggage . <p> His eyes misted a bit as he looked at the sign . ARBOGAST . Henry Lemmon and Amber Arbogast were going to start their new lives together in mere minutes . Henry , Amber , and the dark blue 2002 BMW 525i . Who could ask for anything more ? <p> A trickle of people began to descend the escalator-the first arrivals from the 6:43 AM flight from Albany-and he started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blue jacket met his gaze , then glanced away , and his heart skipped a beat until he realized she was far too old to be his Amber . <p> At the bottom of the escalator , the woman brushed past him , and the cop in him sensed that something was n't quite right . He looked over his shoulder at her as she bypassed Baggage Claim and walked toward the automatic doors . <p> It was the backpack ... Yeah , that was all it was . It just seemed strange for a woman , probably in her late thirties , to be carrying such a big backpack . <p> He shrugged it off and held his sign-ARBOGAST-just a bit higher . <p> The woman in the blue jacket with the backpack walked out into the crisp morning and followed the sidewalk to the end of the terminal , where she proceeded to climb a flight of concrete stairs . Outside the Departures doorway-one level above the Arrivals gate , where Henry Lemmon waited expectantly , his sign held proudly-she scanned the row of cars dropping off passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Finally she spotted a familiar , unsmiling man , staring and waving furiously while leaning across the passenger seat of a car parked at the curb . <p> Walking toward the car , she began dabbing cold cream on her face , not particularly caring who noticed-not that anyone would-until the real face of Chase LaMarca began to emerge through the heavy makeup . <p> Behind the wheel was his partner , Grant Lambert . Chase sighed when he saw he was unshaven , which was Grant 's usual state on those days when he did n't feel the need to be presentable , which numbered approximately three hundred forty per year . As a religious moisturizer , Chase dreaded the effect of the scruffiness on his soft skin , made even more sensitive by this morning 's application of makeup , but after fifteen years together he was resigned to it . Mostly . <p> Chase climbed in as Grant retreated to the driver 's seat . Pulling off his wig and stuffing it in his backpack , Chase asked , without a word indicating affection , " Next time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you take the train , maybe he takes the Long Island Rail Road into the city to meet you , and you 're sort of trapped at Penn Station . If you fly , he drives , and has to go to a different door to wait for you . It 's that simple . " <p> Chase began pulling his male clothing out of the backpack . " But he does n't even know what I look like . What 's he gon na do , start interrogating every single person in Penn Station ? " <p> " Maybe . " <p> Chase rolled his eyes . " I do n't think so . " <p> " And I think , " said Grant , as he turned the ignition , " that we wanted the car , too . Meaning , we go to the airport , where he has to drive ; not Penn Station , where he does n't . " <p> Chase sighed again and tossed a makeup-smeared tissue over his shoulder . Out of the corner of his eye , he watched the early morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that three-day growth of beard sprinkled with even more silver among the brown . His partner had the look of George Clooney gone to seed , which-he had to admit-was n't altogether a bad look , although deep down he thought a George Clooney tending to his appearance would have been preferable . <p> " Plus , " Chase finally continued , as he took off the blue jacket and let the fake boobs that were under it fall to the floor , " I 'm getting too old-not to mention too male - to keep getting on planes pretending to be a teenage girl . TSA is n't stupid . Mostly , at least . You know that , right , Lambert ? They 're developing this imaging technology now that can see right through your clothes . " <p> " It 's over , so do n't worry about it . " Grant turned off the parking blinkers and began slowly edging forward into a traffic lane . <p> " Right through your clothes . Next time , they could see my penis , and there goes that scam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Never again . Hopefully . And put your seat belt on . " <p> " Let me put my shirt on . " <p> Grant eyed the activity around them . " Make it quick . " <p> Chase frowned and pulled a blue sweatshirt over his head . " By the way , that was n't the most sincere apology I 've ever received . " The car entered the flow of traffic and he added , " Nice car . " <p> " Yeah , " Grant said . " Your boyfriend did right by us . " He glanced at the dashboard and added , " That reminds me . " With that , the Suffolk County Sheriff 's Department parking placard joined the wadded-up tissue in the backseat . <p> Chase ran his hand along the leather seat . " Almost a shame to take it to a shop . But we 've got to make a buck where we can make a buck , I guess . " <p> " Mmmm-hmm . " <p> Chase dropped the sun visor , opened the vanity mirror , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think we 've got ? " <p> " With the car ? " <p> " No , with the credit card . " <p> Grant thought about it . He had to recalculate after every one of these jobs . They were all so different , as he had learned when a bank president fell in love with Amber Arbogast , back when she was known as Becky Campanella . That particular scam had not gone well , but as long as they did n't end up in jail , he could chalk it up to experience . <p> " Well , on the minus side , he 's a cop . My experience is , that 's never a good thing . But on the plus side , we know he never checks his credit , so we 've probably got a week , maybe two or three , before he knows for sure that something 's going on . " He thought a bit more . " And we also have six weeks ' worth of chat-room transcripts . Just in case . " <p> Chase flipped the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a tissue . " That 's right . All those transcripts . What if he comes looking for me when he realizes that ' Amber ' was n't on that flight ? " <p> " What 's he gon na do ? " <p> " Maybe I could string him along for a few more days . Keep him off guard . You know , tell him my monstrous parents caught me at the airport , dragged me off the plane , and TriState forgot to take me off the manifest ... Something like that . " <p> Grant shook his head as the dark blue BMW rounded a curve and exited the airport grounds . " Too risky . From this point on , we wo n't know when he catches on , or what he might do . If he brings in his fellow cops now and tells them that he 's been investigating on-line identity theft , well ... His story is n't all that convincing , but he gets to frame the story . It 's better that Amber Arbogast disappears forever . " <p> Chase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I suppose so . It 's just that ... " <p> " What ? " <p> " I du n no . I sort of got to like Amber Arbogast . " <p> Grant Lambert took his eyes off the road for a split second-which he hated to do anywhere , but especially when leaving JFK and entering the Van Wyck-and stared at his partner before swiveling his eyes back to the road . " But you are Amber Arbogast . " <p> " Was , " Chase said with a sigh . <p> Grant patted Chase 's knee and said , " Do n't worry about it , baby . You can become a different teenage girl next week , okay ? One that 's even better than Amber Arbogast . " <p> Chase did n't answer . Instead , he again dropped the visor and flipped open the mirror , giving himself a final once-over . The makeup was gone , but it left a slight rash on his face that blushed his cheeks , which annoyed him . And the wig had mussed the hair he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overdone the highlights the last time he was at the stylist . They were too memorable , which was good if you wanted to make an impression , but not so good if you were in his line of work . <p> Even though in age Chase and Grant were in the same ballpark , give or take a few years , in appearance , well ... They were playing in different leagues . Everything about them-how they took care of themselves ( Chase , obsessive ; Grant , not at all ) ; how they dressed ( Chase , stylish ; Grant , for comfort ) ; how they saw the glass ( Chase , half-full ; Grant , completely empty and the water had been turned off ) - was a polar opposite . Love held them together , but Chase knew-well , he thought , because the circumspect Grant would never confirm nor deny it-that the secret to their long relationship had been in the way they had managed to thrive off their differences . <p> Without him , Chase knew that Grant would have withered away into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set out to be a criminal , but some early decisions had evolved into his only opportunities , and he had run with them as the easiest way to make something out of his life . Grant Lambert was a smart guy who had n't been able to catch a break , but he was doing the best he could to keep above water . <p> As for Chase LaMarca , he had also found his opportunities limited by the twists and turns of life . But there was an undeniable thrill to this sort of sideline-which , for Chase , was a necessary supplemental income , not the whole paycheck-and he and Grant did everything possible to make sure that other bad guys- worse guys-were their targets , so he managed to justify it . <p> And if it had n't been for a little larceny , they never would have met . That had to be put in the plus column , too . <p> In fact , the Pedophile Scam , as they came to call their current project , had even been Chase 's idea . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trolling Internet chat rooms for those logical victims . <p> At first , they found it astounding that otherwise solid citizens would fall in love with grainy pictures of teenage girls and stupid instant messaging ... but , one after another , they did . Sometimes they even had to reject potential suitors because they were stringing along so many middle-age professional men that it was getting confusing . And so many of them-not that bank president ; that had been a bad move on their part-were only too willing to give up their personal financial information in exchange for an opportunity to meet a teenager . <p> The world is full of twisted people , thought Chase , as he sat in the passenger seat of a stolen dark blue BMW 525i . <p> A few miles down the expressway , Grant slowed and merged right onto an exit ramp . <p> " It 's time ? " asked Chase . <p> " Yeah . " Grant glanced at his watch . " Fifteen minutes for him to realize the girl did n't get off the plane , maybe another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget where he left his car ... I figure right about now he 's screaming at an airport security officer . So it 's time . " <p> At the end of the ramp , he waited for the light to turn green before making a left turn and driving a few blocks until he spotted what he was looking for : a parked van with out-of-state plates . He pulled the BMW next to the van , then peeled Henry Lemmon 's EZ Pass reader from the inside of the windshield behind the rearview mirror and handed it to his partner . <p> Then it was Chase 's turn . He darted out of the door-the sun glinting off his blond highlights much the same way it had off Grant 's gray-and skittered to the front of the van , where he affixed the EZ Pass to the most inconspicuous spot he could find on its grille before rushing back to the BMW . The stop had taken them less than thirty seconds . ( Continues ... ) <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
