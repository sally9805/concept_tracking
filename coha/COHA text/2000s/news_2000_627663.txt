A junior at Memorial High School and a varsity basketball player , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a short day . <p> Between studying , games and basketball practice , Tammer also helped his mother , Thora , unpack 20 boxes of Christmas decorations . <p> Before doing anything , though , he made sure to break his Ramadan fast with fruit and water . It was the first thing his mom greeted him with at the door . <p> After that , he was ready for Christmas . <p> Tammer was raised by a Christian mother and a Muslim father , Maher . To him , it has meant the best of both worlds : He celebrates and respects the religious holidays of Christians and Muslims . <p> But the Qaddumi family is also careful to stress the spiritual - as well as social - aspects of the holidays . <p> Ramadan is the holiest of Muslim holidays . It is a month of spiritual renewal , during which Muslims pray , and abstain from food and drink from sunrise to sunset . <p> The holiday 's date depends on the lunar schedule . In the past few years , Ramadan has fallen around Christmas . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of fasting , will probably be on Christmas Day . <p> That means , Tammer said , that the Qaddumis will have to wait until after sundown for their usual holiday snacking . <p> " I think it 's fun because we get the best from both of them , " Tammer said . " You get money on the Eid and presents at Christmas . But I like the family part best . During Ramadan , our whole day is different . Everyone comes home at 5:30 p.m. - usually we are running in all directions . We eat together or we go out to eat with friends . " <p> There are many Houston families that blend religious holidays - some focus on one or the other . The Qaddumis are serious about celebrating both holidays . <p> Thora and Maher Qaddumi enjoy sharing their holidays with friends and family . That feeling has extended to their children Anan , 33 , Halla , 30 , Summer , 18 , and Tammer . <p> " The celebrations ( Ramadan and Christmas ) actually go well together , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a special effort to get together with family and friends . There 's attention to charity and giving to others , and each has an important spiritual focus . " <p> The Qaddumis have found that people of all faiths enjoy celebrating the secular aspects of Christmas , such as Santa . On Christmas Eve , the family hosts a big party with 25 to 50 people . Thora plays piano , and Anan plays tabla ( a type of drum ) , while Christian and Muslim guests don Santa hats and listen to Maher sing The Little Drummer Boy or join in on Deck the Halls . <p> Christmas Day for the family is quieter and more spiritual . <p> Then there are Ramadan celebrations - joyful iftar dinners with friends , where the family breaks its fast . <p> During lunch , Tammer generally retreats to the library to study or visits with friends . Though they are generally supportive , his friends occasionally tease him and dangle tempting food in front of his nose . <p> Tammer smiles . He admits he would rather eat , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accomplished something . <p> When Anan , Tammer 's older brother , was in high school in the 1980s , the atmosphere was much different , he said . There was more emphasis placed on Judeo-Christian holidays , and the Qaddumis did n't feel comfortable taking their children out of school for Eid al-Fitr . <p> Life is very different these days , Anan says . Now his parents feel comfortable taking Tammer out of school for Eid . They get dressed , have a big breakfast , visit two or three families and go to two movies , just as Maher did growing up in Nablus , in the West Bank . <p> " As a teen , Tammer is blended culturally and he has benefited from what we ( older children ) went through , " Anan said . " He is confident enough to be different , and he does n't seem to be bothered by it . " <p> But every blended family deals with holidays differently . <p> The Attar family - Christine and Mohammed Attar and their children , Carolyn , 12 , and Christopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Christopher know about Ramadan , when it 's happening and that it 's their father 's religious tradition . <p> " Both of us ( parents ) were brought up in the religion of our family , " said Christine , who was raised in the Catholic faith . " But neither of us is very strong in our traditions . We tell the children that we all believe in the same God . At Christmas , we stress peace on Earth , good will to men . " <p> Like Tammer , Carolyn enjoys decorating for Christmas and spending time with family and friends . She also believes that being exposed to two cultures makes her more open to the world . <p> " I do n't criticize people as much and say , ' Oh , they 're different , ' " she said . " I know that lots of people are different , because I 'm one of them . " <p> As the daughter of a Jewish mother and a Christian father , 18-year-old Hailey McCrory feels there are no borders between people . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I think that is great , " she said . <p> Haily chose to become Jewish and had her bat mitzvah at age 13. and her family always has celebrated Hanukkah and Christmas with " great gusto , " says her mom , Aimee . <p> Hailey looks at Christmas as her dad 's holiday and Hanukkah as her mom 's , she said , and enjoys celebrating both . <p> " I like them both the same , " Hailey said . " I do n't know what I would do if we did n't celebrate both holidays , it makes it such a special time . My parents always made it very magical for me . " <p> On Hanukkah , which begins at sundown Dec. 21 , Hailey will light the candles and get gifts from her mother . On Christmas , she will get gifts and generally will give her presents then , as it is when most of the family is around . <p> A senior at Memorial High School , Hailey has Jewish , Christian and Muslim friends . Her best friend is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We used to laugh that a little Jewish girl and a little Muslim girl would be best friends , but we are so much alike , " Hailey said . " I think it makes me a lot more open-minded . " <p> This year , when Barbara Zanger and Bill Ashton put their Christmas tree up , they topped it with a Star of David made by Bill . <p> Barbara has fondly dubbed the tree her Hanukkah bush . Barbara , who is Jewish , and Bill , a " lapsed Catholic , " attend the Houston Congregation for Reformed Judaism , where her father , Michael LeBurkien , is rabbi . Many members of the congregation have interfaith marriages . <p> Their children , Allyn , 3 , and Anthony , 10 months , already celebrate Christmas and Hanukkah . But this year marks a first . <p> " This is the first year we will talk about Santa , " said Barbara , who plans to raise her children in the Jewish faith . " If they can think of it as a game , then that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up a stocking , that is OK , too . My problems are not so much religious-based . It 's just that Christmas is so pervasive , there is no way out . I was not prepared for that , " <p> Even though her children are young , there have already been some wonderful cultural moments , Barbara said . Like the day her older son recited a prayer in English and then in Hebrew . <p> For the past few years , the Ramona and Tony King family has celebrated Christmas and Kwanzaa , an African-American holiday . This year they will observe Christmas in a spiritual way and without a tree . <p> The family 's children , Tamarind , 11 , Vincent , 10 , and Malcolm , 6 , will get gifts from their grandparents . But this year the family will focus on the seven nights of Kwanzaa , which starts Dec. 26 . <p> " I do n't like the commercial side of Christmas , " Tamarind said . " And I do n't think we have the right to cut down a tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your house . " <p> Kwanzaa , she said , is about recognizing people and ancestors from the past and how they have contributed to history . Each of the seven nights represents different principles - unity , self-determination , responsibility , cooperative economics , purpose , creativity and faith . <p> " I think it 's good for children and grown-ups to know stuff about different cultures , " Tamarind said . " I just think the only holiday that is n't commercialized is Thanksgiving . Even Kwanzaa is a little commercialized . " <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55929 <p> choice . A swimming lure such as the Rat-L-Trap with saltwater The slow-sinking mullet plug stopped against a sharp strike . I hit on reflex and a 3-pound speckled trout wallowed near the base of the jetty rocks . <p> " Try not to lose that one , " yelled Doug McLeod , perched on a nearby granite shelf . The advice was aimed at an inglorious miss on a fish moments earlier . <p> The trout was large enough , strong enough , to pull a short burst of line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surface and scuttled to a lower vantage . The line worked closer and , with a well-timed surge of tide , the rod flipped the fish onto the flat rock . The trout flapped silver and bright against the setting sun . <p> I gripped the prize behind gill plates and remembered the old jetty rat 's trick of running a cord stringer through the lower jaw before attempting to unhook the lure - one flounce and an untethered fish might be lost amid the many cracks and crevasses of the rocks . <p> The needle-nosed pliers twisted the chartreuse and gold plug free and I held the fish high for McLeod to admire , but he was dancing rock-to-rock under a bending rod . <p> We hit a school of specks just as the sun sank , but before the fish pulled from reach we strung six " solid keepers " in the 18- to 22-inch class ( OK , he had four , but he is semi-pro and hard to pace ) . In addition , we had a few throwbacks and several missed strikes . <p> We did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercise was worthwhile . And , significantly , it occurred last week . <p> Most coastal anglers reserve serious jetty walking for the warm-water months but , in truth , winter on the rocks can be rewarding - and a lot less crowded . Speckled trout in the 2- to 6-pound class are the top draw for light-tackle anglers casting lures and live baits , but redfish , black drum , and panfish are within reach . <p> The key , as always , is to go when conditions are right . During winter , that often means connecting with the days of light wind and green water behind the passage of a norther . Often , a window of mild , calm weather is available , and both mornings and afternoons can be productive - assuming tidal current is moving . Dead water can be painfully slow on the rocks at any time of the year . <p> The rocks themselves are a big plus during the cold-water months . In addition to providing cover for bait and predators , they absorb and reflect heat from the sun during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter lake can benefit from warming riprap along dams and levees , so the savvy jetty rat can key on the sub-surface jumbles of granite . <p> As another plus , the various Gulf jetties offer proximity to deeper water where fish can seek refuge during severe blows of dropping tides and temperatures . Jetties framing shipping channels offer access to some of the deepest inshore water on the Texas coast ; even rock groins and jetties framing sanded-over cuts ( such as the Fish Pass on Mustang Island south of Port Aransas ) have the buffer of the open Gulf . <p> Regardless of depth , a slow retrieve usually is best for the winter trout plugger . Chill water slows the reaction of receptive fish ( the Gulf was pegged at 60 degrees the afternoon McLeod and I fished , and it is at least 5 degrees colder now along the upper coast ) . <p> The top draw for large winter trout is a mullet-type plug - in plain and unabridged English , a MirrOLure . Again , these fish are not moving fast and prefer a sizeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains the go-to choice for many veteran rock walkers . <p> However , the hugely popular nose-rigged 51M-series used for bay and near-surface duty might not be as effective as the original head-rigged 52M . The latter tracks deeper and sinks faster , more efficient for sounding along the jetties . Remember , the depth beyond the sloping rocks might be 6 to 12 feet on the Gulf side , and 15 feet or more feet on the channel side ( within casting distance , as opposed to the main shipping lane ) . Cold-water fish tend to hug bottom , or hang along the sloping edge , and the idea is to remain in that kill zone as much as possible during the retrieve . <p> A plug such as the 52M that gets down is the percentage choice . A swimming lure such as the Rat-L-Trap with saltwater riggings is another good option . An old , discontinued King Bingo is a fine choice , assuming you can locate a few ( the solid-plastic , fast-sinking Bingos in fishable condition are available for $ 5 to $ 10 from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crankbait such as Bagley Fat Free Shad or Bomber Model A also might be worth a try . <p> This is not to say that the shallow-running , slow-sinking mullet plugs such as the 51M , the Catch 2000 and the Corky are not worth trying . Under low-light conditions , jetty trout may unweight from bottom and hold along the sloping rocks within several feet of the surface . A shallow-runner that tracks straight rather than diving can reach these fish - and with much less likelihood of snagging a rock . <p> Various soft plastics work well , especially when " keeper " 1- to 2-pound sand trout are ganged off the ends of the winter jetties . A Texas-rigged ( snagless , with hook point turned back into the body ) soft jerk bait such as a Bass Assassin or Slimy Slug might be very effective bumped along the bottom and up the slope , but you seldom see this approach used on the rocks . <p> Spoons are marginal for winter rock walking . Casting out and across the rocks forces a fast retrieve to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quick pace keeps the offering above winter-stunned trout . Certainly , you can slow the count and pump near bottom , but breaking off $ 3 spoons gets old after a while . Leadhead jigs are much cheaper to feed to the rocks . <p> Regardless of offering , it eventually will get snagged on the jetties . Heads-up fishing demands concentration and the willingness to work as close as possible to danger . Most old timers chunking plugs and jigs use the count-down method , figuring six or eight seconds in close , and a 10- or 15-count in deeper water . It is always a gamble , and there is no accounting for stray rocks , but the count down at least provides a workable base . <p> For example , if a 5-pound trout hits at eight seconds , you know how long to count on the next cast . Conversely , if a 500-pound rock snags at eight seconds , you might try a prudent six count after re-rigging . <p> Often , walking below or above the snag , reversing the angle as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A tougher draw is the hook that hangs in a wad of discarded line tangled around a sub-surface rock ( a sad but common situation on high-use jetties ) . The line-fouled hook slides back and forth , offering no firm angle or leverage . All you can do is pull straight back and hope . <p> For this reason , many veteran jetty pluggers use heavy casting lines in the 17- to 20-pound range . Granted , a heavier line does not cut through the water as efficiently as a thinner 12- to 14-pound line , but it improves the chances of plucking a snagged lure . <p> Also a consideration , the heavier line is less apt to nick or fray when brought in contact with exposed rocks and barnacles . On that note , the experienced rock walker learns to monitor any billow of slack line following a backlash or wind-blown cast . If a rock-wrapped nick is evident ( felt between thumb and index during the retrieve ) , take the time to re-rig or risk bitter disappointment over a splashing sow . <p> Walking the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast offer drive-to opportunities for anglers on short schedules . Certainly , no coastal fishing is cheaper and more accessible . <p> I will not go so far as to say that jetties are better during winter than summer , but it is a huge mistake to assume that the gray rocks are dead during December and January . This especially is true for the plugger gunning for good trout . <p> TYPE : - LINKS- @55930 <p> ' Scary Movie ' <p> If you can forgive gleeful vulgarities , this parody of teen slasher flicks is a well-sustained yuck-fest with moments of show-stopping hilarity . <p> Not content with " Scream 's " satire of horror schlock , " Scary Movie " merrily mocks everything from Scream itself to " The Sixth Sense , " " The Blair Witch Project , " " The Matrix " and TV 's " Whassup ?
