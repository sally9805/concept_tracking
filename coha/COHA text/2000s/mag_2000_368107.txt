Well before Election Day , campaigns tend to be lost or won depending on whose vision of the race prevails . The secret code of the Bush campaign is that politics does n't really matter , the country is at peace , the market is up , so you can afford to vote for the guy you like because we 're all happy centrists now . George W. Bush has all but dared Al Gore to fight on that ground , as he strolled down the middle of the field , threw up a tent and invited every voter to the party . <P> Gore heard the music and read the polls and saw that this was a contest he could not win . He is sharper when he 's in a fight , but Bush has not played by the Gore rules . He 's been a confounding foe , he wo n't say anything specific enough to give Gore a target , and yet he has had the crowd on his side from the start , to the point that even some Democratic voters were drifting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a different fight . " The presidency is more than a popularity contest , " he declared in his speech on Thursday night . " It 's a day-by-day fight for people . " All that populism , the hymns to long-haul truckers and late-shift waitresses , is not really about changing tactics ; it 's about changing enemies . He may not win a popularity contest against George W. Bush , but he might win one against , say , Exxon . You did n't hear him so much as mention Bush last week . Instead he found the enemies he wanted : the greedy HMOs , the polluters , the tobacco and oil companies . If the demons seem real and the stakes are high and issues actually matter , Gore gets to fight on the ground where he is strongest , win back the Democrats who have wandered off , maybe even warrant a second look from the fickle soccer moms . If he 's artful , he can do it without sounding too much like Huey Long  --  just wrap the New Democratic message in an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Centrist Democrats who are desperately rooting for Gore are watching this with their heart in their throat . Nearly everything about the Gore tack  --  indeed , much of last week 's party convention in Los Angeles  --  left them scratching their head and pining for that old Clinton magic . Why does Gore have to use the word fight 20 times in his speech when every survey shows many swing voters want all the partisan fighting to stop ? " It 's hard to lead a nation by dividing it , by pitting people against each other , " Bush shot back the next day . " That 's the rhetoric of the past . That 's ... class warfare . " For that matter , why was the whole Democratic spectacle so , well , democratic ? Every interest group got its five minutes in the spotlight : the Clinton family on Monday , the Kennedy family on Tuesday and then , the next night , a picket line : speakers from the teachers union , the AFL-CIO and the N.A.A.C.P. Four years ago , Bill Clinton won a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , crime fighting , deficit reduction . Last week Gore sang that refrain too , but you had to listen carefully for it .
