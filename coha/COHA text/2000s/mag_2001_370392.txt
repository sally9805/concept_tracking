David Schoch , 30 , a telecom executive , is taking some time away from work to get his M.B.A. , and he spends his days in such seminars as Economics of the Firm and Management : People , Principles and Processes . In the evenings , he works on group projects at the apartment he shares with two other guys . In many ways , his existence is like that of any first-year student at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business . Yet when Schoch walks to class each morning it is not along the blustery shores of Lake Michigan but through the bustling streets of Barcelona , past Antonio Gaudi 's Casa Batllo , to a century-old art-nouveau office building that bears the University of Chicago 's red-and-white logo above its filigreed iron balconies . <P> Schoch is one of a new generation of global executives commuting to class with passport in hand . An American whose primary residence is Prague , he manages some 300 employees across the Czech and Slovak republics for GTS , a firm based in London with offices in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Europe . But for 13 one-week stays over two years , Schoch is jetting into Barcelona to join 80 classmates of 24 nationalities . <P> In addition to learning such traditional M.B.A . subjects as accounting and finance , the students participate in a special summer session devoted to global commerce . For three weeks , Schoch will travel from Barcelona to the University of Chicago 's flagship Illinois campus and then to a second satellite campus that the university opened last fall in Singapore . " I 've spent most of my career overseas working with people from different countries , " says Schoch . " It just did n't make sense to drop everything to get my M.B.A . back in the U.S. " <P> As more and more businesses have shrugged off borders , so too have the institutions that train corporate executives . In a survey of 55 deans of top business schools conducted by Rice University this spring , globalization tied with technology and entrepreneurship as the No. 1 priorities for improvement . Aspiring global execs are also getting trained in other ways , whether through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zones , or at the summer seminars popular among Americans at the highly regarded Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires ( INSEAD ) business school in Fontainebleau , France . INSEAD is collaborating with the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania to exchange faculty and students among campuses in Fontainebleau , Philadelphia , San Francisco and Singapore . Already 39 Americans are earning M.B.A.s through INSEAD in France and Singapore . <P> These borderless B schools underscore a broader educational trend . Universities are now the fifth largest U.S. exporter of services abroad  --  topping entertainment and health care  --  and raked in $10 billion last year . In the past two years , Duke University 's Fuqua School of Business in Durham , N.C. , has opened an outpost in Frankfurt , Germany , while Harvard has established research facilities in Hong Kong and Buenos Aires . And in April , Cornell announced that it would open a branch of its medical school in Qatar .
