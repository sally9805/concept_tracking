The brain , wondrous as it is , poses a special challenge for scientists . Mental disorders play out in a 3-lb. universe that is largely inaccessible without drastic  --  and extremely risky  --  surgery . At least it was until the 1970s , when the first crude pictures of the living brain were taken . Today researchers can peer into that universe with a variety of scanning technologies that capture the brain in action and send back beautifully detailed images that are the next best thing to being there . <P> The best results come from combining two or more scanning methods . Some capture the size and shape of brain structures ; others freeze-frame the ever shifting activity of nerve cells as they fire and subside . With this information , doctors are beginning to understand  --  at the level of the neuron  --  how mental illnesses occur . " Brain imaging , " says Dr. Nancy Andreasen , a leading schizophrenia researcher at the University of Iowa and the MIND Institute in Albuquerque , N.M. , " has changed the face of psychiatry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this field has occurred , and the images on the following pages trace the remarkable journey that scientists are taking as they search for the roots of this disorder and perhaps someday a cure . <P> 1970s Computed Tomography ( CT ) <P> CT scans represent a major advance over the simple X ray , which did not allow doctors to visualize brain tissue at all . Instead of a flat , two-dimensional X-ray picture , CT scanners produce a series of successive images . Taken as the patient , lying down , moves through a scanning ring , these " slices " can be combined to create the illusion of depth . The resulting pictures of bone and soft tissue can help doctors distinguish between patients with a psychiatric disorder and those with head trauma ( which can trigger similar symptoms ) . CTs have been particularly useful in identifying schizophrenia patients . In the 1970s researchers uncovered the first distinguishing abnormality in these patients ' brains : the ventricles ( fluid-filled open spaces ) , circled in yellow , are significantly larger in those with the disease , left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provided the first clue that schizophrenics may have less brain tissue affecting cognitive functions such as attention and memory . <P> 1980s Magnetic Resonance Imaging ( MRI ) <P> This technology takes advantage of the body 's natural magnetic field , measuring changes in the field 's energy as patients are exposed to various radiofrequencies . Unlike CT views , MRIs can be rendered in full 3-D because MRI machines can slice along three or more planes , not just one . A computer can then compile the information to generate a sort of relief map of the brain , left , depicting even the smallest brain structures ( for example , the brain 's center for emotion , the amygdala , in yellow , is deeply buried but visible ) . Using MRIs , scientists have learned that the brains of schizophrenics , above right , are smaller than those of people without the disease , above left , and that they have smaller frontal lobes , the part of the brain responsible for planning , decision making , higher learning and emotions . <P> 1980s Positron-Emission Tomography ( PET @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
