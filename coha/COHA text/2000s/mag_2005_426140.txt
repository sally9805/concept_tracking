Pastors Creflo and Taffi Dollar have built a multimillion-dollar megachurch empire by practicing what they preach Photograph Clockwise , from top left : The World Dome ; a Bible study service ; a moment of prayer at work ; Dollar with a Hurricane Katrina evacuee. // This is not your typical storefront church with the afterservice fish fry . This is another world . You know you 're getting close when traffic comes to a dead stop near the pawn shops on Old National Highway south of Atlanta . I sit in traffic with the masses , watching as some people give up , park on a grassy median , and walk the rest of the way , Bibles in hand . Farther up around the corner , sheriff 's deputies direct the hordes . The congregants are in Sunday-go-to-meeting suits , sneakers and stilettos , cutoff jeans and baggy T-shirts , dreadlocks and do-rags . There 's an urgency about their stride , a thrill , even , as if they are part of something bigger than themselves , bigger than most any churchgoer could imagine . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flock who worship under the spiritual direction of Pastor Creflo A. Dollar , a onetime college football star turned minister , and his wife.Taffi Dollar . Together the Dollars oversee a " megachurch " ( see sidebar ) that seats 8,500 and is usually filled to capacity for the two Sunday services . There are no crosses , no stained-glass windows , no images of Jesus . There is no single piano in the corner played by the pastor 's sister-in-law , but a full band with horns , guitars and congas . The production values are right out of network TV . A camera on a crane swirls above the crowd , and even the keyboard player has headphones on . " Megachurches play on a whole different understanding of religion , and it 's not something that looks like your parent 's faith , " says Scott Thumma , a sociologist of religion at the Hartford Institute for Religion Research . " They 're tapping into the bigger-is-better , mall-like mentality of America . And that 's not going away anytime soon .

There 's the staff of 300 employees here in Atlanta and 100 more in New York . There are the flow charts and cabinet meetings and audits and auditors . There are the recording label and the ministerial divisions . There are the Saturday-night sermons at New York City 's Madison Square Garden and the Gulfstream jet to get him and the ministry there and to their outreach offices all over the world .

She also preaches regularly and helps her husband in any way deemed necessary . Church members call him Pastor Dollar and nonaffiliates know him as Dr. Dollar . At the Sunday service that I attend , he wears no robes or kente cloth draped around his neck , nor does he have the gray hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , dressed in a threepiece suit , his wavy hair trimmed to perfection . His pinstriped movie-star image glows from two ten-foot screens flanking the pulpit and about a dozen television monitors angled toward the back rows . His congregants say they come to hear a kind of gospel that is part self-help , part power of positive thinking , but biblically based . To outsiders , this message-with its references to abundance , increase and money-may seem to be a call to get rich through Jesus . But the Dollars and their followers are quick to point out that they seek abundance in all its forms : financial , spiritual , emotional , marital . " Prosperity is not just money , " Dr. Dollar says in one of his signature phrases . " It 's gaining success in every area of life . " This philosophy is woven into the fiber of his sermons . " If you have experienced increase , " Dr. Dollar says from the pulpit , " and would like to honor God with your first-fruit offering , we rejoice with you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then , as the buckets pass through the aisles to collect the offering , he blesses the assembled : " I declare increase to be an anointing on your life ! God is getting ready to take your life into overflow ! " SERVING THE MASSES Some 23,500 people belong to the Dollars ' church in Atlanta alone and there are thousands more in New York . The church also has offices in South Africa , Nigeria , Australia and the United Kingdom . Dr. Dollar is so busy that he can not perform every marriage ceremony or visit all the sick and shut-ins . There are assistant pastors to marry people , and a whole corps of doctors ready to minister to the sick . " We 've been here nine years and have never met Minister Dollar , " says one member who credits the church 's counseling services with strengthening her marriage . " He ca n't physically do it all .

She says the church literally changed her life : She lost weight , left an unhappy marriage , is raising six boys alone , and is happily considering life with a much younger man . She believes she does n't need to touch the pastor 's robe or know everybody 's name to feel she belongs . In fact , she likes it this way . It 's like choosing a restaurant . " I ca n't go to a church where it ai n't but a few cars out there , " she says . " How good can it be ? Here I 'm being fed . I leave a tip every time . " Indeed , anonymity can be an attraction . " It is an opportunity to be a part of a community but also remain private , " says Robert M. Franklin , Ph.D. , a professor of social ethics at Emory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many people do n't want the village in their business and their lives . They want to be able to take their seat and have no one make ethical demands on them . At a megachurch no one will single out Sister or Brother So-and-So to help the church out . " One business manager and faithful attendee says he does n't expect to meet with Dr. Dollar any more than he 'd expect to meet his company 's CEO . Instead , he enjoys walking into the spectacle of Sunday at the Dome . " It 's nice to see something this grand be for God , " he explains . For their part , the Dollars accept the fact that most of their members will never see the church 's first family up close . " We do n't stress out because we do n't know everybody and everybody does n't know us , " Pastor Taffi says . " We try not to let it all rise and fall on our shoulders . We delegate . What matters is , " Are your needs being met ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning , and Dr. Dollar is in the studio at his administrative building , which is part of a complex that is called the campus . Like everything else , the studio is a professional outfit , with teleprompters and ten or 12 studio staff-light men , cameramen , sound guys , makeup artist , director . Dr. Dollar is there to tape new promos for the books and programming that they produce . Over and over again he delivers the lines his staff has prepared for him , and they move quickly from product to product , from " The Undeniable Laws of Prosperity " to " The Statutes of Abundance . " He glows golden in the studio lights and speaks with a network anchor 's baritone . He nails most of the promos , shaking his head when he flubs a line or two . " You may have a runny nose , an aching back or a sore throat , " he begins , " but the moment you say you have the flu , that 's exactly what you 'll have .... " He 's leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to purchase the teaching called the " Mouth/Heart Connection . " It will end with a broad smile and the words , " Order today ! " " Is that okay ? " he asks . " Marketing 's fine with that ? " They will also tape fragments of phrases- " Next on Creflo " ... " This is Creflo ... " - to use as teases for Creflo , a secular talk show . Seeing the lights , the cameras , the expert delivery under the watchful eye of marketing , it is apparent that the Dollars have the resources to take the Message to the masses . Many outsiders may question this commercializing of God and wonder how to justify seemingly worldly means to achieve a spiritual end . The official view at World Changers Ministries is that religious institutions deserve to be run with the same efficiency and resourcefulness as businesses that do not have the potential to do as great a good . But Dr. Dollar 's parishioners are his greatest defenders . One congregant remembers being at a finance meeting as an airline executive . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought to herself : This company 's CEO is making millions , and no one ever questions his motives . Yet Pastor Dollar is feeding my soul . If this is what he needs to do God 's work , then I feel blessed and honored that he is able to do it . BEYOND THE PULPIT The Dollars have a home in a chic Black neighborhood south of Atlanta , where their house stands out from the rest , if for no other reason than the giant CAD and TLD built into the wrought iron gates out front . It 's a long way from the cinderblock duplex Dr. Dollar grew up in as the son of a policeman and a cafeteria worker . Inside this house , one of two they own , there are exuberant vases of silk roses and feathers ; gold swag draperies ; a gym ; a private sitting room ; a theater with leather recliners , footrests and cupholders ; an indoor pool with a big letter D at the bottom ; and a master suite the size of your average New York apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name ) by a white baby grand in the foyer .

He is the star of the family , but in the 20 years they 've been married , she has risen to the demands of their partnership while raising their three daughters , Jordan , 15 , Alex , 12 , and Lauren , 8 . ( They also have two grown adopted sons , Jeremy and Greg , who are both Caucasian . ) During the interview Taffi listens raptly to her husband , interjecting a tidbit when he asks , which he does often . She is maternal , but not a bit matronly . She seems to have found a way to balance traditional wifely submissiveness with the confidence of a modern , independent woman who occasionally wears Chanel pumps and carries a Louis Vuitton bag .

When he threw himself into Bible studies with his best friend from school , word spread , and the group started to grow . " Everybody was talking about this Creflo Dollar guy , " Taffi remembers . Growing up , she had not been especially religious , but she joined , too . " He seemed very sincere and had a sense of purpose , " she says . " I liked that . " She liked it so much she defied her normally reserved nature and invited him to a game she had tickets for . " I think I caught him off guard , " she recalls . " He was saying , " I do n't know . I have to think about it . ' I knew not to push it . I knew how far to go .

" And she was everything I had described . " Taffi believes their union still works because they keep God first , and each other second . And their approach to marriage is very traditional , with the husband being seen as the head of the household and the wife being submissive . " For modern-day women , the topic of submission is very hard , " Taffi admits . " I 've been married 20 years , and I 'm still working on it . " AN EXPANSIVE MINISTRY Certainly their formula has sustained their relationship through the growth of their ministry from their salad days after college , when her husband served as a pastor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own services in a school cafeteria each Sunday , and later that year he moved into his first church , not far from where he grew up . He called it World Changers , a phrase he had used since college . His practical message of self-empowerment , his come-as-you-are , nonjudgmental , nondenominational , total-life prosperity preaching caught hold with people and soon he was delivering four sermons every Sunday to standing-room-only congregations . But he could n't do four sermons every Sunday forever , so in 1991 the church set about raising enough to build a church big enough to hold thousands . They called it the World Dome . It exists because of the basic economic principle of supply and demand . Now the Dollars are a part of a whole new culture and category of worship , and all that comes with it .

" To the Dollars , and their followers , the sky 's the limit . " How many of you are ready to be flooded with all the fullness of God ? " he asks during a recent sermon .

" Sidebar Something Like a Phenomenon As the number of megachurches serving our community continues to rise , we wonder if bigger is always better The nondescript building bears a " CCC " ( for Christian Cultural Center ) sign and is surrounded by colorful gardens . From the street it looks as if it could be a corporate headquarters . But inside this sprawling place of worship , built on a six-acre gated complex in the middle of Brooklyn , there is a bookstore and a caf , a restaurant , a flower shop and more . The sanctuary , with its stadium seating , holds thousands of people and each of CCC 's three Sunday services are pretty much filled to capacity . Welcome to Sunday service in the age of the megachurch . By definition , a megachurch attracts at least 2,000 attendees to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historically existed in urban areas , over the last 35 years the numbers of these supersize congregations have grown substantially . In 1970 the nation had ten megachurches ; by 1990 there were 250 . According to John Vaughan , founder of Church Growth Today , an organization that monitors and consults megachurches , today the numbers have surpassed the 1,000 mark . While the majority of these big churches tend to be White evangelical congregations . Black congregations are joining the megafold , too . There are approximately 300 Black megachurches across the country that attract a total of about 500,000 people to their pews ( or plush seats ) on Sundays , says Vaughan . The majority tend to be found in areas with significant Black communities , including Texas , California , Georgia and Illinois . In fact , the D.C. corridor from northern Virginia to Baltimore is home to the largest number of Black megachurches in the country , with more than 40 . While many of these big churches , such as Creflo Dollar 's World Changers Church International ( 23,500 members ) , TD . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Betty Peebles 's Jericho City of Praise ( 19,000 members ) have charismatic pastors , the real attraction seems to be the large congregations themselves and the overall services these church communities can offer . Often they have their own gyms , health clinics , schools , recreation programs and Internet cafs . They may offer financial-planning courses that include credit counseling , mortgage help and economic advice . A number have community-development corporations that provide housing as well as establish new businesses like record labels , music studios , publishing houses , radio and television shows . They are often better positioned to respond to crises like Hurricane Katrina . Three weeks after that devastation , Jakes partnered with Kirk Franklin to host a benefit gospel concert for victims . Sidebar " It is the one-stop shopping principle , " says R. Drew Smith , scholar-in-residence at the Leadership Center at Morehouse University in Atlanta .

They want their congregations to address a wide range of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious drawback is that personal interaction with the pastor is Often lost . Megachurches attempt to get around such a potential turnoff by creating smaller , targeted ministries that many members praise . They range from men 's ministries to teenage girls ' ministries to hip-hop ministries . At CCC there 's even a bikers ' ministry because its pastor , the Reverend A.R . Bernard , is an avid motorcycle rider . " This church is so welcoming that I do n't notice the size , " says CCC member Olivia Montgomery , 36 . " From the moment I walked through the door , I never felt like an outsider . There was always a place for me . " More worrisome to critics , however , is the socalled prosperity preaching or emphasis on individual success . Not all megachurches follow this dogma , but it seems to be increasingly popular , especially among some of the largest and fastest-growing congregations . Building a church 's own kingdom and thus expanding services for its members sometimes seems the primary concern . Churches are then run like businesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determine just how much money these entities have . Such information is not public , and churches rarely volunteer financial information . If they do divulge their financial status , they offer only conservative estimates . Still , the emphasis on economic issues of these churches seems to resonate with the post-civil-rights generation of young , middle-class professionals as well as with upwardly mobile working-class folks , creating congregations generally younger than the traditional churches . But what gets lost , critics argue , is the tradition of social justice of the Black church . " There tends to be a religious privatism rather than the transformation of the society at large , " says Smith . Although the vast majority of Black churches have no more than a couple hundred members , the access that larger congregations have to political and corporate powers due , in part , to their size , ca n't be ignored .
