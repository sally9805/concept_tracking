1 <br> <p> lt was two weeks before Chinese New Year , the spring festival that marks the end of winter . It is the principal holiday of the year , with celebrations that last seven days . Red Luck Posters were stuck to the door of each home . Meat was marinated and strong rice wine , ju , bought . Families arranged visits , and banquetswere prepared . In Beijing millions thronged the temple fairs to complete their holiday shopping . <p> The largest miaohui was in Ditan Park . There the noise was deafening . Drums thudded , cymbals clashed , and trumpets blared in the cold air . Stall holders called their wares , and customersshouted for children to keep up . <p> Swept along by the crowds , Mei walked beside her sister , whose mood had darkened . " Why must we come here every year ? " Lu moaned . " All these people pushing each other  --  and where 's Mama ? " <p> " She said she wanted to buy something . " Mei stood on tiptoe to search @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white stone arch of the sacrifice altar , where the emperor would offer sacrifices to earth at the summer solstice , and behind it , more crowds and stalls . <p> " Fireworks ! Fireworks for Spring Festival ! " <p> " Luck Posters to welcome the spring and banish ghosts ! " <p> Dancers on stilts appeared at the end of the lane , accompanied by trumpets and drums . The women wore red satin and waved vast pink fans . The men were in long blue robes and domed hats beneath which their faces were heavily made up with thickly lined eyes and rouge cheeks . Two children ran in front of them , causing some to wobble . At that moment Mei saw her mother pushing through the crowd with two bottle gourds . <p> " Hulu ? " Lu frowned and uncrossed her arms to take the gourd . <p> " For luck  --  and a grandson soon , " said Ling Bai . <p> " Mama ! " Lu protested . Her blush of embarrassment was endearing . <p> " As for you "  --  Ling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against demons . " <p> " I do n't need it . " <p> Ling Bai glared at her elder daughter . " Thirty-one years old and no boyfriend ? You need a lucky charm . " <p> Lu nudged Mei with her elbow . " Just take it , " she whispered . <p> " Hulu is very powerful . Look at the curves . It 's heaven and earth in union , true harmony . Especially lucky for a woman , " Ling Bai averred . <p> They walked up the stone steps to the sacrifice altar , where a jiaozi theater was in full swing , musicians playing in exaggeratedways , trumpets , drums , cymbals , and an erhu , a Chinese stringed instrument . As four men danced , they tossed a sedan chair  --  the jiaozi  --  with an actress inside it . <p> " Where are you going , young wife ? " roared the men . <p> " Going back to my mama ' s house , " sang the actress . <p> " Where is your husband ? " <p> " At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The audience laughed . But Lu stood rigid and glared at the spectacle . She loathed folk dancing . Mei glanced at her mother , who was smiling , enjoying the play . Her face was lined , and strands of her gray hair blew across her face in the wind . Mei shivered with cold and guilt . But how could she love if she could not forgive ? She had learned the truth , which had separated her from her mother as completely as if a shutter had fallen between them . <p> She shook her head as if to clear it . She wished she could confide in someone , to share the burden . <p> " Shall we find some bingtang hulu ? " asked Ling Bai . Candied hawthorn on a stick was a favorite winter delicacy that everyone munched at the miaohui . <p> " Not for me , " said Lu . " How can you eat something that 's been lying about in this dust for hours ? " <p> The Wangs made their way to the North Gate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " People are staring at you , " Mei muttered to her sister . <p> " Are they ? " <p> Lu sounded indifferent , and Mei knew why . Her sister was strikingly beautiful but never gave it a thought . It was of interest only to others . <p> Ling Bai bought two bingtang hulu , one for Mei and one for herself . They ate them as they walked . The path leading to the North Gate was packed with stalls . A man was pouring tea from a large copper pot with a very long spout . Smoke rose from kebab braziers , the scents of cumin and chili in the air . Colorful windmills spun , and red lanterns dangled like giant fruit from leafless branches . <p> An ice slide stood in the middle of North Gate Square , childrenand adults squeaking and laughing as they slid down . A long queue snaked around the ticket booth . Bright banners displaying miyu , riddles , hung from the trees , where a large crowd had gathered . <p> Ling Bai and Mei liked miyu . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had competed on National Day and won prizes . <p> " There 's one , " said Mei , reading aloud . " ' A good beginning  --  a foreign currency . ' " She thought for a while . " The answer is U.S. dollars  --  mei yuan . Mei means ' beautiful , ' and yuan can mean ' beginning , ' " she whispered to Ling Bai . <p> " Oh , yes ! " exclaimed her mother . " Write it down and we 'll win a prize . " <p> " One wo n't get us far . We 'll need to solve at least ten to win something worthwhile , " Lu said . <p> " We have plenty of time . " Mei glanced at Lu . <p> " I 'm tired of standing about in the cold , " said Lu sweetly . It was n't a complaint . " We 've been out for hours . " <p> " Perhaps you 're right , " Ling Bai said , clutching her shopping bag . <p> Lu took her mother 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> They heard a drumroll from the direction of the sacrifice altar , and someone shouted , " Lion Dance ! " The crowd surged . <p> Mei , Lu , and Ling Bai walked out of the North Gate , where taxis were delivering revelers to the fair . Lu found an empty one and got in , her mother following . Mei sat next to the driver . <p> " Where to ? " cried the driver jovially . <p> " The Grand Hotel , " said Lu . <p> He started the engine and turned on the meter . " Which way shall I go ? Changan Boulevard is at a standstill . " <p> " Whichever way 's the quickest , " said Lu with a hint of impatience . <p> At the Grand Hotel , they sat at a table with a white linen cloth in the Red Wall cafT . The waitress brought tea in a silver pot , and as she set it down , the china tinkled . She went away , then returned with a cappuccino for Lu . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spiral staircase with a vine growing up the banister . Potted plants and panoramic windows gave the impression of a lush conservatory . A waiter brought Western cakes on a trolley , so perfect they might have been made of plastic . <p> Ling Bai eyed them . " Too beautiful to eat . " Mei ordered a yellow piece with icing . She hoped it was cheesecake , which she had eaten once before and liked . <p> Lu stirred her coffee . " They were saying there 'll be snow tomorrow . " <p> " I 'm not surprised . This is the time of Big Chill , the coldest two weeks of the year , " said Ling Bai . <p> Sitting in the cafT , Mei found that hard to believe . They were insulated here from the outside world . <p> Lu took out her mobile phone . " Li-ning is having lunch at the China Club . Maybe he could join us if they 've finished . " <p> Mei and Ling Bai sipped their tea , awkward together now that Lu 's attention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her strong nose and firm mouth making her profile sharp . The sky was darker , clouds dense , and traffic thick as mud idled on Changan Boulevard . Mei stretched for a glimpse of Tiananmen Square , which was not far away , but she could n't see it . <p> " Ca n't you come for a few minutes ? " Lu said into the phone . She sounded annoyed . <p> " When do you leave for Canada ? " Mei asked her mother , although she knew the date . She was embarrassed that Ling Bai was eavesdropping on Lu 's conversation . <p> " In a week , I think , " said Ling Bai gloomily . " Will I see you before I go ? " <p> " You know that Gupin , my assistant , is going home for Spring Festival . I 'm afraid I 'll be too busy , " Mei said to her teacup rather than to her mother . <p> Ling Bai sighed . " You should think of finding a new assistant . I thought you were doing well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially a man ? People will talk . " <p> " I do n't care what anyone says . Gupin is good at his job . Unlike some , he has a high school diploma and is taking evening classes at the university . " Suddenly , Mei was picturing Gupin 's chiseled face and muscular shoulders in her mind 's eye . She wondered what he was doing this weekend . Perhaps he was still at work on the case of the boy who had died in the hospital during a routine operation . Perhaps he had been shopping for his sick mother  --  he could even have been at the miaohui , buying Beijing treats to take home . The thought made her smile . <p> Lu shut her phone . " I 'm sorry . Li-ning wo n't be able to come , even though he wants to . They 're going to the driving range with Big Boss Dong . " <p> " He 's always busy . " Mei remembered the last dinner Li-ning could n't make . <p> " Everyone wants to collaborate with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to be a tycoon . " <p> " Surely  --  " <p> " I do n't mind . I know what it takes to be a success . He has to put a great deal of time and effort into networking , which means making sacrifices in our personal life . I have to do the same for my show , " Lu said . She hosted a program on Beijing TV in which she interviewed and offered counseling to people who had problems such as adulterous affairs or difficult mothers-in-law . It had proved popular , and for a time there had been talk about broadcasting it nationally . <p> " You both work so hard I hardly see you , " Ling Bai said , looking first at Lu , then at Mei . " Especially you . " <p> " Mama , you know everyone wants their case solved yesterday . " <p> " Opportunity ! It 's everywhere these days . If you do n't grab it , someone else will . " Lu raised a hand to silence Mei , who had been about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you make , Mei , catching cheating husbands , but for us , lost opportunity might cost millions . So we work all the time , trying to keep up . Li-ning and I know we 're being unfair to our family and friends "  --  she laid a hand affectionately on her mother 's  --  " and that 's why this Spring Festival , we 're taking Mama with us to Vancouver to see Li-ning 's family . " She turned to Mei . " Mama told me you 've stopped going to see her since she came out of the hospital . " <p> " You 've done no better . " Mei stole an uneasy glance at Ling Bai . <p> " I 'm busy . I have my show , I lecture , and sometimes I travel overseas with my husband . And yichuo  --  you ca n't imagine ! Dinners , lunches , parties , going to the theater and the opera with business contacts . If we never said no , we 'd be working twenty-four hours a day . But Mama ' s been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together . " Lu glanced at Ling Bai . " We 've grown closer since she had her stroke . What happened last spring made me realize that we ca n't take anything for granted . One day we will lose her , and then we 'll wish we 'd looked after her properly . " <p> Mei could n't contradict her , but neither could she explain . She was silent , swirling the tea in the bottom of her cup . <p> " Have you heard , " said Ling Bai , eager to defuse the tension , " Hu Bin 's been released . " <p> " Was n't he one of the student leaders at Tiananmen ? " <p> Ling Bai nodded . " Mei knew him at university , did n't you ? " <p> " I met him a couple of times on campus , " said Mei . She had seen it in small print on page twenty-one of today 's Beijing Daily . Hu Bin had been sentenced to twelve years for leading the student protest in 1989 . His release , three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hu Bin 's release had brought back uncomfortable memories . Mei had already been working at the police headquarters  --  the Ministry for Public Security  --  when the students had taken to the streets in the spring of 1989 . Every day she had read avidly about the protest in the square , but unlike millions of other office and factory workers in the city , she had not gone out to join them . She had sat behind her desk at the ministry , ensconced on the other side . The side who , in the end , went against the students . To this day , she reproached herself for that . The guilt for not having being with those she cared about lodged in her heart like a stone . But how could she have known that it would end in blood ? That people would die and friends like Hu Bin would be imprisoned for so long ? <p> She could reproach herself for so much . It had been her , really , she reflected , who had stolen her father 's life . Their mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cultural Revolution ; it had been her only way to save her children from the labor camp . Her evidence had helped send him to prison , where he died young . When Mei stumbled on the truth the year before , while uncovering an ancient jade lost since the Cultural Revolution , she had been angry at first , but then she had grieved . Hatred threatened to destroy her love for her mother . Mei wished she could forgive the woman who had made such great sacrifices and given Mei life twice . <p> Her mother 's voice brought Mei back to the Red Wall cafT . " It 's a goodwill gesture , I suppose , to release him before the holiday . " <p> " I 'm sure that 's right , " said Lu , finishing her coffee . " It 's about time , too . Such ancient history . It 's better for both sides to forget . " <p> " It 's only been nine years , " retorted Mei . <p> " Exactly . Ancient history . " Lu tossed her hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you live too much in the past , and everyone else has moved on . How does the old proverb go ? ' The present is like gold . ' " <p> At that moment , the waiter brought their cakes . For a while they gazed , awestruck and silent , at the art on their plates . Then Mei took a bite of hers and shuddered . It was lime , not cheesecake , and she did n't like lime . <p> " Lu 's right , " Ling Bai said to Mei through a mouthful of her napoleon . " You must forget the past and move on . Do n't carry it with you . Learn to forgive . " <p> Mei 's heart jumped . Did her mother know that she had found out what had happened to her father ? <p> " Will you go back to Ya-ping ? " Ling Bai asked . <p> Mei sighed . " But you did n't like him  --  you did n't want me to marry him . " <p> " That was years ago , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a successful businessman now , living in Chicago . " <p> " He 's also divorced . " <p> " So is Li-ning . " Ling Bai gazed proudly at her younger daughter . " That it may make him a better husband . " <p> Mei took another bite of her cake . " Once a cup 's broken , it ca n't be mended . " <p> " That 's because you do n't want to mend it , " said Lu . " He broke your heart , yes , but that 's more ancient history . Live in the present . It 's the key to happiness . " <p> " And you can let me worry about my love life . " What if Mei could n't learn to forgive and forget ? <p> Lu gestured to the waiter for the bill , then said to Mei , " But I care about you because you 're my sister . A friend of mine will call you tomorrow . His name is Mr. Peng . He 's the chairman of Guanghua Record Company . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big one . " <p> " Thank you , " said Mei . Her sister had irritated her with unsolicited advice , but she had just redeemed herself . <p> Copyright 2008 by Diane Wei Liang <br> Continues ...
