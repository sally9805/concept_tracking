The man smiled and I let my gaze linger over his face . His eyes were a lovely shade of pale blue . Their color reminded me of a Siberian husky , except the person sitting next to me was no animal . Of course , he was n't human , either . <p> " I have to leave now , Nick , " I said . " Thanks for the drinks . " <p> He stroked my arm . " Have another one . Let me enjoy your beautiful face a little longer . " <p> I stifled a snort . Was n't he flattering ? But if he liked my face so much , then his eyes would n't have been glued to my cleavage . <p> " All right . Bartender ... " <p> " Let me guess . " The loud voice came from across the bar . An unfamiliar face grinned at me . " A gin and tonic , right , Reaper ? " <p> Shit . <p> Nick froze . Then he did what I was afraid he 'd do-he ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaulting after the fleeing figure . Heavily armed men in black clothes sprinted into the bar , shoving the patrons aside . <p> Nick threw people at me as I went after him . Screaming , flailing bodies hit me , making my attempts to catch them and fling a silver knife through Nick 's heart even more difficult . One of my blades landed in Nick 's chest , but too far center to have hit his heart . Still , I could n't just let those people splatter to the floor like so much garbage . Nick might think of people that way . I did n't . <p> My team fanned out , guarding all the exits and attempting to herd the remaining patrons out of the way . <p> Nick reached the far end of the bar and glanced around frantically . There was me , advancing with my silver knives , and my men with their Desert Eagle handguns pointed at him . <p> " You 're surrounded , " I stated the obvious . " Do n't make me angry , you wo n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girls . " <p> He had two of them in his grip , one hand on each vulnerable throat . Seeing the terror in those girls ' eyes made anger flare through me . Only cowards hid behind hostages . Or murderers , like Nick . <p> " I leave , they live , Reaper , " Nick hissed , no romance in his tone any longer . " I should have known . Your skin 's too perfect to be human , even if your heart beats and your eyes are n't gray . " <p> " Colored contacts . Modern science 's a bitch . " <p> Nick 's icy blue eyes bled to glowing vampire green and his fangs slid out . <p> " It was an accident , " he yelled . " I did n't mean to kill her , I just took too much . " <p> An accident ? Oh , he had to be kidding me . " Her heartbeat slowing down would have warned you , " I replied . " Do n't try that accident crap on me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an oops ' moment once . " <p> If possible , Nick looked even more ashen . " And if you 're here ... " <p> " That 's right , mate . " <p> The accent was English , and the tone was lethal . Invisible waves of power rolled over my back as my men parted to let Bones , the vampire I most trusted-and loved-through . <p> Nick 's gaze did n't shift , which I 'd been hoping for . No , his eyes did n't leave me as he suddenly yanked my blade from himself and then stabbed one of the girls in the chest . <p> I gasped , catching her instinctively when Nick threw her at me . <p> " Help her ! " I yelled to Bones , who 'd lunged at Nick instead . With that wound , unless Bones healed her , she had only seconds to live . <p> I had time to hear Bones mutter a curse before he spun around , abandoning his pursuit of Nick to drop to his knees beside the girl . I vaulted after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but only a few . With the rest of the bar patrons still scrambling for the doors , plus Nick holding the other girl like a shield , my team could n't just open fire . Nick knew that , and so did I. Nick leapt across the heads of the crowd in a gravity-defying burst , flinging the girl at a member of my team as if she were a weapon . Helpless , the nearby soldier fell back with the girl on top of him , just in time for Nick to swoop down and yank his gun away . <p> I flung three more of my knives , but with all the jostling from the people around me , my aim was off . Nick let out a yell as they pieced his back , missing his heart . Then he turned and fired at me . <p> I had a fraction of a second to realize that if I ducked , those bullets would hit the people around me instead . They were n't half vampire like I was ; it would likely kill them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a blur in the next heartbeat , my head jammed into Bones 's chest while three hard vibrations shook him . The bullets meant for me . <p> Bones let me go , whirling around and flying across the room to Nick , who tried to snatch another hostage . Nick did n't make it . Bones plowed into him hard enough for both of them to smash through the wall . I ran , hopping over people , in time to see Bones twist his knife in Nick 's chest . <p> I relaxed . Silver twisted through the heart meant curtains for Nick-and any vampire . <p> Bones gave one last twist for good measure and then drew his blade out , his eyes flickering over me . <p> " You 're bleeding , " he said , concern creasing his face . <p> I touched my cheek , where someone 's belt or shoe or whatever had scored me when Nick was using people like human speed bumps to slow me down . <p> " You 've been shot , and you 're worried about a scratch on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " I heal instantly , luv . You do n't . " <p> Even though I knew what he said was true , I could n't help but feel his back to reassure myself that his skin was smooth , no more shredded flesh from the bullets . <p> " Speaking of , there are dozens of injured people here you need to heal . You can get to my scratch later . " <p> Bones ignored that , drawing his thumb across a fang and touching the cut it made first to my cheek , then to my mouth . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
