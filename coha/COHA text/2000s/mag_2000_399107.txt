Section : Companies , People , Ideas Something is n't right with the water in the Gulf of Mexico . Are we going to spend $5 billion to fix it before we know what 's going on ? <p> THEY CALL IT THE " DEAD ZONE . " It sure makes good copy . The two words appear in headlines in Newsweek , the New York Times and the Washington Post . In Science , it 's " death by suffocation . " The articles are all about fertilizer runoff that flushes down the Mississippi River basin , giving rise to algae blooms in the Gulf . When these die and decay , they suck the oxygen out of the ocean water , allegedly killing fish . <p> Proposed solution to this environmental problem : Cut way back on nitrate fertilizer on farms and the number of farms themselves within the drainage basin of the Mississippi . It could be done , but it would be massively expensive and it might not accomplish any improvement in the Gulf . The truth is that no one knows exactly what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are . <p> Despite the uncertainties , there is a movement afoot to do something drastic to bring the dead zone back to life . The Committee on Environment &; Natural Resources ( CENR ) , appointed by the White House Office of Science &; Technology Policy , has just released the final part of a report urging draconian actions : a 20% cutback on fertilizer use by perhaps half of all American farms , along with converting 5 million acres of farmland to wetlands . Cost of this program ? About $4.9 billion a year . <p> The dead zone is big  --  about 7,500 square miles  --  and it has doubled in size since 1985 . In this space plant growth is above normal and the oxygen level in the Gulf water falls so low that it becomes difficult or impossible for fish to breathe  --  what scientists call hypoxia . <p> Fertilizer runoff clearly contributes to the Gulf hypoxia . But how much ? <p> The problem , says Jonathan Pennock , an associate professor of oceanography at the University of Alabama , is that since 1950 there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , and there has been an increase in hypoxia in the Gulf . But since 1985 the hypoxic area has doubled , even as the fertilizer concentration has gone down . <p> The area of the zone increased tremendously in 1993 following a massive flood in the Midwest . Is that because the flood washed nitrates out of fields into rivers , eventually dumping them into the Gulf ? Maybe . But then why did the zone last year finally fall back to essentially its pre-flood level , only to balloon to its largest size ever this past summer ? How can that be traced to the flood ? <p> " To me it points to the multiple factors that go into affecting the hypoxic zone , " says Pennock , " and shows it 's not a simple problem with any one cause . " <p> Pennock might be considered biased since the Fertilizer Institute paid for a study he did of Gulf hypoxia . But then , is the antifertilizer crowd without taint ? The most quotable authorities on the evils of nitrate runoff are Nancy Rabalais , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chauvin , La. , and her husband , R. Eugene Turner , a coastal ecologist at Louisiana State University in Baton Rouge . They have become environmentalist darlings , including winning the San Diego Foundation 's Blasker Award for environmental science and engineering and a check for $250,000 . <p> Though direct measurements of the Gulf 's oxygen content only began in the 1970s , there are indications it has varied dramatically over time . Sediment analyses indicate hypoxia became more severe in the 18th and 19th centuries , long before the widespread use of chemical fertilizers . <p> Derek Winstanley , chief of the Illinois State Water Survey in Champaign , notes that the hypoxic zone is off to the west of the Mississippi , " but when you look at the satellite photos from 1993 you see the flood debris do an immediate U-turn , go east , and are taken up into the Gulf Stream past the Carolinas . " Why would fertilizer nitrates follow an opposite path ? <p> You also rarely hear that hypoxia zones are common throughout the world , usually where fertilizer could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles of ocean that are naturally hypoxic , " says Winstanley , " including the whole of the Pacific Ocean offshore from the Canadian-American border to Chile . " <p> Causes and contributors aside , the underlying current of all the fuss is fish . Something has to be done because fish are dying and fishermen are suffering , right ? Wrong . <p> " Economic assessment based on fisheries data failed to detect effects attributable to hypoxia , " the CENR report admits . The dead zone is a bad spot to fish but fishermen working the edge of the zone pull up net-ripping catches . Still , says the report , if the zone grows larger , it could eventually affect the industry . <p> Being a federal creature , the CENR ca n't imagine alternatives requiring less than iron-fisted regulation and vast expenditures . But farmers have already begun employing high-tech solutions to reduce both fertilizer use and runoff , such as using satellites to determine which acres might need less fertilizer . <p> New crops are also under development that need less nitrogen fertilizer . One wheat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same yield with a third less fertilizer . Such crops could be blanketing the country faster than the Army Corps of Engineers could put into gear a scheme to convert some of America 's most productive farmland into muskrat metropolises . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : World food demand is rising , but this farm on the Mississippi could become wetlands . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : The government report admits there 's no evidence fisheries in the Gulf of Mexico are suffering . <p> By Michael Fumento <p> <p> Michael Fumento is a Senior Fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington , D.C. <p>
