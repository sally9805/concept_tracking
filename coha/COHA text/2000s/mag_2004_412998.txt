In their 1974 bestseller All the Presidents Men , reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein credited a highly placed source dubbed Deep Throat for much of their success .

A penchant for self-promotion is n't the only characteristic these sometime business partners have in common . Both of these bigheads come with some bad hair .
