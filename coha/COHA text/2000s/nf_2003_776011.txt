The Rise and Fall of Smallpox // The medical history of smallpox is a saga of untold human suffering , unforeseen human inventiveness , **28;63;TOOLONG human triumph . Smallpox was a loathsome disease , spreading around the world from antiquity to modern times . It was transmitted by an invisible virus ; it infected an individual person and an entire community with remarkable speed ; and it proved fatal to nearly one-third of its victims . Those who somehow survived a painful two-week period of fever , skin eruptions , and internal organ damage were usually left with severe scarring and sometimes blinded . There was no cure . // Origins of the Disease // No one knows for certain when , where , or how the smallpox virus first appeared on earth ; we do know that it has circumnavigated the planet multiple times over many centuries , invading every place of human habitation . We also know more generally that the incidence of different forms of microbiological infection is probably almost as old as life itself : the first fossil traces of higher organisms , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insidious fungi and other parasitic attachments . // Even within written human history , it has proven impossible to trace the patterns of smallpox origins and evolution thoroughly , in part because of the lack , until the modern era , of a standardized medical lexicon . All sorts of plagues , rashes , pox diseases , and other pestilence were referred to interchangeably , and the ancient scribes ' unscientific reports of the symptomatology do not always adequately distinguish the different types of ailments . Even in the modern era , accurate differential diagnosis has remained a challenge , as smallpox can sometimes masquerade as several distinct types of maladies , including the familiar chicken pox and more exotic novelties , until laboratory findings confirm the initial clinical impressions . // The image of smallpox as ubiquitous and ominous was well captured for the entire world by the British historian T.B . Macaulay in 1848 : " Smallpox was always present , filling the churchyard with corpses , tormenting with constant fear all whom it had not yet stricken , leaving on those whose lives it spared the hideous traces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at which the mother shuddered , and making the eyes and cheeks of the betrothed maiden objects of horror to the lover . " // The smallpox virus may have originated from a random mutation of some other , less venomous , and even older , strain of unknown virus , maybe around 10,000 b.c. , perhaps somewhere in the fertile Ganges River plain in India . Some authors suggest-but it can be no more than speculation-that some relatively mild disease agents spontaneously adapted themselves from early domesticated animals or from lower primates to human hosts : the viruses that cause cowpox and monkey pox , for example , are still identifiable as close variola cousins today . // The term variola was derived in a.d. 570 by Bishop Marius of Avenches ( near Lausanne , Switzerland ) from the Latin varius , meaning spotted , or perhaps from another Latin term equally descriptive of the disease , varus , meaning pimple . In turn , the English word smallpox was coined in the sixteenth century , to distinguish between this disease and syphilis , which then became generally known as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the skin rashes the two maladies could produce . Other cultures likewise applied their own vocabulary in recognition of the power and destructiveness of smallpox : in some parts of West Africa , for example , it was known as naba , meaning " the chief of all diseases . " // The first traces of what we now recognize as smallpox epidemics can be discerned among the records of ancient Egypt , India , China , and Greece , when agricultural settlements achieved population densities sufficient to sustain unbroken communication of the virus . Three mummies from the eighteenth and twentieth Egyptian dynasties ( 1570 to 1085 b.c. ) , for example , have exhibited the characteristic scarring interpreted by modern experts as evidence of smallpox . The first individually identified smallpox victim whose remains we can inspect , Pharaoh Ramses V , died in 1157 b.c. , presumably from this disease : sophisticated modern analysis of his mummy has revealed the distinguishing pustular eruptions . He thereby inaugurated a miserable tradition of fatal or near-fatal smallpox infection among royalty and prominent leaders , as well as legions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some estimates , 10 percent of all human deaths worldwide each year were attributable to this one illness . // Some of the best evidence about ancient epidemics comes to us from war records : about 1350 b.c. the Hittite armies , for example , were devastated by a fatal contagious disease that apparently originated among the Egyptian prisoners of war they had seized in Syria . The illness killed their king , Suppiluliumas I , as well as his son and successor , Arnuwandas II , and led to a period of degenerative instability within the Hittite empire . Some experts familiar with the records now contend that this , too , was variola at work . Similarly , smallpox is credited with killing one-quarter of Athens 's soldiers and countless civilians around 430 b.c. , undermining that city-state in its competition with Sparta . Carthaginian troops also became infected with a contagious disease while besieging Syracuse in 395 b.c. , depriving them of the potential for capturing Sicily and thereby threatening Rome ; Alexander the Great 's foot soldiers , while invading India in 327 b.c. , suffered from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been smallpox . // Half a world away , smallpox entered northern China in about 250 b.c . The Great Wall had been erected to repulse the invading Huns , but it proved little impediment to the virus they carried , and Chinese texts reported a terrible " epidemic throughout the empire " in 243 b.c . Japan , too , sparsely populated at that time to support endemic smallpox , was victimized nonetheless by recurrent epidemics , as visitors from China or elsewhere introduced the virus repeatedly , as early as the sixth century a.d. // On the average , smallpox killed at least 25 percent to 30 percent of the people it infected . The disease would spread with devastating speed , especially in the increasingly densely populated urban areas of Europe . Perhaps three to seven million people lost their lives to smallpox during the early days of the Roman Empire , and countless others were blinded or suffered other crippling impairments . Thereafter , increasing human mobility brought the disease to wider and wider areas of the planet , and sub-Saharan Africa , too , fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in an irregular geographic pattern . The only constant was the disease 's ability to kill both the high-born and the commoner-not distinguishing between " princes and peasants , " as the title of Donald Hopkins 's 1983 book puts it . Queen Elizabeth I of England was infected in 1562 ; she survived , but two Japanese emperors , kings of Burma and Siam , and perhaps the Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius were less fortunate . Smallpox killed " a queen of England Mary II , an Austrian emperor , a king of Spain , a tsar of Russia , a queen of Sweden , and a king of France in the eighty years before 1775 . " Abraham Lincoln was stricken with a mild case of smallpox upon his return from delivering the Gettysburg Address in 1863 ; perhaps he acquired the virus from his youngest son , Tad , who also survived ; the president probably passed the infection on to his valet , William H. Johnson , who died . // Four characteristics of smallpox shaped its transmission patterns . First , the disease was spread through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the air for short distances or passed along by immediate physical contact with a diseased person or with his or her clothing or linens . Proximity was thus a requirement for dispersion . Second , smallpox appeared in an acute , manifest form ; it could not be carried asymptomatically or secretly . Third , it virtually never struck the same person twice : anyone who contracted the disease and managed to survive it thereby incurred lifelong immunity . ( Consequently , adolescents whose faces bore its characteristic pockmarks were much in demand as nannies and servants ; anyone else could be a conduit for variola ) Fourth , the disease affected humans exclusively ; there is no reservoir for variola in flora , fauna , soil , or air , as there is with so many other insidious disease agents . // The combination of those factors meant that smallpox would commonly appear in waves , several years apart . It might , for example , flare up in a particular city , where the closely spaced houses facilitated the virus 's access to new bodies . A great many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infection had run its course within the defined population , however , another outbreak was unlikely for several years , as most people would be either dead or immune . Only after a new generation had been born would there once again be a sufficiently large unprotected population for the virus to attack ; when it was reintroduced , say , by a traveler , it would again work its way through the new victims . The grisly reality was that smallpox became , perforce , an episodic disease of children-in eighteenth-century Britain , for example , a full 90 percent of the victims were under ten years of age . // A vivid illustration of the contagion was offered by the experience of the Spanish conquistadors in the New World in the early sixteenth century . Latin America , isolated from viral or other contact with Europe , was virgin territory for variola : no one there was already immune . When the virus was first imported into Caribbean islands by incoming slaves , whole tribes were instantly wiped out ; half the native population of Puerto Rico was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Later that year , when explorers Hern ? n Cort ? s and Panfilo de Narv ? as encountered the Aztec civilization of Mexico , variola accompanied them . As the disease spread quickly , the natives " died in heaps , like bedbugs . " The Spaniards , many of whom had survived smallpox epidemics as children seemed impervious to the illness , a fact that heightened the impression that they had mystical powers . The Aztecs soon lost their emperor to smallpox , as well as numerous other local leaders who might have effectively resisted Cort ? s . Estimates of variola 's death toll among the Aztecs range from two to fifteen million ( out of a total population of less than thirty million ) , within only a few months . // The macabre story was next repeated in Central America , as variola accompanied the Spanish southern advance upon the Mayan civilization . Epidemics struck Yucatan in 1520 or 1521 , killing off half the population and a comparable percentage of its leadership . Likewise , the Incas in Peru were devastated a few years later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? s and Francisco Pizarro to subdue opponents who greatly outnumbered them . // In North America , too , smallpox proved an essential , if unwitting , ally of the European colonizers . As late as 1600 , there was probably no experience with smallpox north of Mexico , and , accordingly , no individual or social immunity . Following the earliest explorers , however , a decimating illness that may have been smallpox reportedly killed 90 percent of the Indians along the Massachusetts coast from 1617 to 1619 . Another smallpox epidemic arose in the populations near Plymouth Colony in 1633 , killing twenty immigrants from the Mayflower and whole tribes of Indians . Enormous epidemics soon swept westward , inflicting terror and mass death among tribes along the Great Lakes : the Hurons and the Iroquois were especially hard hit . // A century later , smallpox asserted itself again , during the French and Indian War of 1754 to 1763 . In any particular battle , one side or the other ( or both ) suffered enormously from the illness , and neither could count on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disease . In 1755 , the so-called Year of the Great Smallpox Epidemic , Native American tribes were profoundly struck , and thereafter outbreaks-at roughly one-decade intervals-plagued the cities of whites and villages of Indians alike . // During the Revolutionary War , smallpox altered military strategy and shifted the course of battles . George Washington ( who himself had survived a bout with smallpox , caught during a visit to Barbados in 1751 ) was loath to send his troops into Boston in pursuit of a fleeing British General William Howe in 1776 , because of a smallpox epidemic then raging in the city . Later , smallpox among the colonials ( rather than the military prowess of British reinforcements ) compelled them to break off their threatening siege of Quebec , which could have been a decisive rebel triumph . Smallpox continued to harass both sides for the duration of the war , and fear of the contagion even played a role in the logistical maneuvers leading up to the Yorktown campaign in 1781. // By the eighteenth century-when smallpox was killing an average of 400,000 people per year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to differentiate smallpox from other , similar impairments and had developed a sophisticated understanding of variola 's disease progression . With the increasing reliance on the scientific method , they had routinely and painstakingly recorded the progression of the illness in an individual and in an entire population . The inquiry was confounded , however , by the fact that the disease could assume markedly different characteristics in otherwise similar individuals , giving rise to nomenclature differentiating half a dozen different smallpox types , including " fulminating , " " malignant , " " benign , " and " modified . " // In a " standard " case , variola virus was thought to enter the human body through the lungs or , less frequently , the skin . Smallpox typically started with a ten- to fourteen-day incubation or latency period following the initial exposure ( the " pre-eruptive stage " ) , during which the infected person exhibited no signs or symptoms of pathology . For the next three days ( the " prodromal stage " ) , various flulike effects would emerge : some victims suffered headache , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and delusions , and a scarlet rash might appear on the face or body . Then , oddly , for a day or two , the fever would subside and the victim would feel better , as if recovering from some other , less deadly , ailment. // At that point ( the " eruptive stage " ) , however , the smallpox infection worsened . //
