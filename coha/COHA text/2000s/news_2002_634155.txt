<p> Paul Vallas is the painfully shy , bullied nerd who triumphed over a lifetime of insecurities to become the man Mayor Daley called " quite simply the best chief executive in the history of the Chicago public schools . " <p> Now , he 's one of three Democratic candidates for governor , fighting for his party 's nomination with the same dogged determination he once used to overcome stuttering . <p> " When you 're raised in an immigrant household with four absolutely wonderful parents , there are no obstacles . There 's no chance you wo n't succeed , " said Vallas , referring to the grandparents who lived in his house and helped shape his upbringing . <p> " Even when you were stuttering and stammering , and kids would make fun of you , there was always somebody there to hold your hand and whisper confidences . And my dad was always there as a role model  --  through hard work , discipline and drive , you could achieve anything . " <p> The second of four children , Vallas , 48 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's corner grocery store at 111th and Roberts Road . <p> Gus Vallas , his father , earned an accounting degree at night on the GI Bill , drove a milk truck and worked in a steel mill by day to support his young family and went on to achieve success in the restaurant business . He started with a Kentucky Fried Chicken and ended with three bustling restaurants in the south suburbs . <p> " The joke was that my father wanted to spend more time with his family , so he opened a restaurant and made us all work there , " said Vallas , a clone of his workaholic father . <p> The Country House Restaurant in Alsip was " like the family farm , " said the candidate 's sister Marianne Kountoures . " We all worked it  --  anything that needed to be done . At 14 , I was a waitress . The guys were bus boys and peeled potatoes . You name it , we did it . " <p> Sharon Vallas , a former suburban police officer , met her husband while working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . <p> " Paul was in college , but he would have to serve his weekends over at his dad 's restaurant while , at the same time , trying to work on his thesis , " Sharon recalled . <p> " He would literally take up a whole booth with his books and papers . " <p> ***** <p> Growing up , Paul Vallas suffered from a severe stuttering problem . The same guy who can hardly stop talking as an adult barely said a word as a child . <p> " He could n't even say , ' Mom . ' He never answered the phone . He had to fight to get the words out , " said Mary Vallas , the candidate 's mother . " I took him to Northwestern for evaluation to make sure it was n't anything psychological , and they sent me to a therapist , who suggested exercises . Every day , we put a button in his mouth with a string attached so he would n't swallow it . I would give him a sentence , and he would repeat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enunciate . " <p> Stuttering gives the victim 's loved ones an irresistible urge to finish the sentence , but verbal assists were a no-no in the Vallas household , said Dean Vallas , the candidate 's younger brother . <p> " My mother would n't allow it . We 'd get smacked in the head if we interrupted when Paul was talking . You had to wait . Let him get the words out . Do n't help , " Dean recalled . <p> The stuttering and stammering would continue to plague Vallas through graduate school at Western Illinois University , prompting him to confront the problem head-on . He got a teaching certificate , packed his bags for Montana and spent 10 weeks student-teaching on an Indian reservation . <p> " I had to teach five classes by myself , so I 'd either stop stuttering and stammering , or I could n't teach , " he said . <p> ***** <p> Name any movie , and Vallas , who sees almost everything , can recite the cast . Name an NBA or Major League Baseball team , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's stats . <p> " He has a mind for sports like a steel trap . His real goal in life would be to become the general manager of a baseball team , " said longtime Army National Guard buddy Randy Thomas . <p> It 's a role that Vallas played to perfection during his boyhood days in Roseland . <p> Paul organized an alternative sports league for the neighborhood kids who were n't good enough to make the elite travel teams . <p> The lost boys so loved the football and baseball competition  --  and the player statistics meticulously kept by Vallas  --  they would stand outside screaming , " Yo , Paul , " to summon their de facto GM while the Vallas family was eating dinner . <p> One day , the Roseland boys " at the top of the food chain , " as Dean put it , showed up intent on disrupting the competition . Their leader stole a football that had been given to Dean as a present . Paul snatched it back and got beaten to a pulp . <p> " Paul went after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his eyes hemorrhage . But Paul just would n't stop . He would n't give up , " Dean recalled . " It breaks my heart . I still feel guilty about it , I guess , because we probably should have done something . But we were all too scared , so Paul was all alone . It was just him and their punk leader . That 's Paul . He just reeks of passion . That defines him . " <p> ***** <p> Thirty years later , Paul Vallas would share that passion with an entire city as the face of public education in Chicago . <p> After successful stints as City Hall revenue and budget director , Vallas was paired with mayoral chief of staff Gery Chico and dispatched to the Board of Education to direct Daley 's risky school takeover . <p> That began a stormy marriage and a whirlwind , six-year reign that drew national acclaim . Vallas and Chico made Chicago the first U.S. model for ending social promotion , maintained labor peace in a school system with a sorry history of teacher strikes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They found funds to hold back poor-performing students , dispatch expert help to struggling schools and finance reforms from mandatory summer school , new after-school and expanded early-childhood programs to reduced class size , metal detectors in all schools and a five-year high school program . <p> Through it all , Vallas was a tireless , ubiquitous headline machine . He worked round-the-clock and demanded the same of a staff that got used to being on what they called " Vallas time . " He compulsively controlled every story about the schools . <p> " His leadership style was very troubling . ... I 've never encountered anyone with so little tolerance for criticism or even input or suggestions from people closely involved in the schools , " said Julie Woestehoff , executive director of Parents United for Responsible Education . <p> Woestehoff said she knows from experience how thin-skinned and vindictive Vallas can be . When a newspaper story about local school councils contained a critical quote from Woestehoff , Vallas called her on the carpet , then stripped her organization of its contracts to train LSC members at 90 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done to hurt our organization and the LSCs that we support in retaliation for our disagreement with some of Paul Vallas ' policies , " she said . " When that happens with Paul Vallas , he slams the door . " <p> ***** <p> When Daley finally canceled the " Paul and Gery Show " last year , it was not only because he was itching for progress on student reading . The mayor was also fed up with Vallas ' patented defensiveness . He firmly believed that Vallas was engaged in a smoke-and-mirrors game and that he had grown more concerned about perpetuating his savior image than he was about improving student performance , Daley confidantes said . <p> Vallas abhors the media hound label . He says he was everywhere as schools CEO simply because that personal touch was needed to " reconnect the system to the public " at a pivotal juncture . <p> Relinquishing the schools CEO 's job and the extraordinary platform that it provided was n't easy for Vallas , who was afforded hero 's status and hounded for autographs in the schools he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was clear the mayor desperately wanted to make a change . That forced Daley to pull the plug and play the heavy . <p> " When you get fired , you have to go up on the podium and sing praises to Caesar , " said Thomas . " You tell everybody how great your boss is and how happy you are to be leaving . " <p> Vallas followed the script at his final City Hall news conference , and Daley sang his praises right back . You could cut the tension with a knife . <p> ***** <p> For a career bureaucrat who has become somewhat addicted to media attention , the campaign for governor has provided a smooth , albeit temporary landing . It also has become the family farm all over again . <p> At a recent news conference called to unveil his health care plan , Vallas came off like the long-winded policy wonk that he is . He 's a treasure trove of ideas , but he still has a tendency to overanswer questions and hit the rewind button in mid-paragraph , a remnant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few troubling inconsistencies . <p> Vallas fashions himself as a budget whiz but leaves political observers wondering how he manages his own campaign finances because he has yet to air a television commercial to counter the blitz by U.S. Rep. Rod Blagojevich ( D-Ill . ) . <p> Vallas has unveiled a sweeping ethics proposal to restore the public 's " trust and confidence " in state government , but his campaign has paid $8,750 to controversial political gadfly Ziff Sistrunk , who has been arrested 16 times since 1985 , convicted twice on felony counts and pleaded guilty to contributing to the delinquency of a minor . <p> Asked why the Vallas campaign would hire an ex-con , campaign manager Matt Ryan said , " He lied about his background . Since he lied , I 'm going to terminate him . " <p> Still , Vallas appears to have momentum of late . His poll numbers are surging . Former state Comptroller Michael Bakalis , the only other Greek American in the race , dropped out . And Vallas is piling up key endorsements from the Rev. Willie Barrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former U.S. Rep. Glenn Poshard ( D-Ill. ) , the 1998 Democratic nominee for governor who 's still wildly popular Downstate . A radio commercial featuring Poshard is scheduled to hit the Downstate airwaves this week . <p> Gov . Ryan has even joined the Vallas chorus , with some glowing comments about the candidate 's education expertise . <p> Win or lose , Vallas has proved once again he has come a long way since his nerd days . <p> " Paul loves children . He can relate to them . When he makes governor , he 'll be able to continue this . He knows what it 's like to struggle . He knows what it 's like when things do n't come easy , " Mary Vallas said . <p> Dean added , " I am so proud of Paul  --  not of his accomplishments . It was hard for him to assimilate out there . He overcame that stuttering by being a leader . What I 'm most proud of is that he 's a functioning , confident adult . " <p> PAUL VALLAS <p> AGE : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police officer .
