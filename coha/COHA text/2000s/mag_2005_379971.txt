IT WAS ON SEPT. 10 , A DAY SHY OF THE fourth anniversary of the attack on the World Trade Center , that Imam Mohamed Magid met terrorism 's victims face to face . He was presiding at the funeral on Long Island for the daughter and son-in-law of Bangladeshi Americans from his Sterling , Va. , mosque . The children , who were at work in the North Tower , perished in the Sept. 11 attack , but not until this past August had medical examiners identified enough of their charred tissue and bone fragments for the parents to hold a funeral . Staring at the two wooden boxes covered with green embroidered cloth and surrounded by grieving family members , the Muslim cleric was gripped by both sadness and rage . " The terrorists who kill in the name of Islam claim they are the martyrs , " Magid told TIME later , the anger still roiling him . " But the victims are the martyrs . The terrorists are the murderers , and God will deal with them on Judgment Day . " <P> From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the some 600 full-time imams across the country , is fighting his own war against radicals trying to hijack his religion . For Magid that has meant not only condemning terrorism but also working closely with the FBI in battling it . He regularly opens doors for agents trying to cultivate contacts in his Muslim community , and he alerts the bureau when suspicious persons approach his congregation . That puts him in a precarious position : How does he maintain credibility as a spiritual adviser while , in effect , he is informing on fellow Muslims ? To understand that balancing act , TIME spent two weeks following Magid as he raced from prayer to prayer , meeting to meeting , in the strange new world of American Muslim ministry . <P> Breaking with tradition has n't bothered Magid . Born 40 years ago in the northern Sudanese village of Alrakabih along the Nile River , he studied Islam under African Sunni scholars , who included his father . Magid immigrated to the U.S. in 1987 , when his ailing father came seeking medical treatment . Unlike many foreign imams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ withdraw to their mosques , he reveled in the cultural diversity . " I never had a Jewish friend until I came to the U.S. , " says the gregarious imam . " And the questioning of all religions here helped me strengthen my own beliefs . " <P> Magid reached out , taking college courses in psychology and family counseling , teaching classes on the Koran at the Islamic Center and Howard University in Washington . One of his African-American students at Howard  --  Amaarah Decuir , who had recently converted to Islam from Catholicism and was getting a master 's degree in education  --  eventually became his wife and educated him on women 's issues . In 1997 , Magid became imam of a mosque just west of Washington called ADAMS , an acronym for All Dulles Area Muslim Society . An imam can be a layman sufficiently versed in the Koran to lead daily prayers , but larger , more established mosques hire professional imams , comparable to Christian ministers or Jewish rabbis , who are trained in Islamic seminaries or mentored by scholars .    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
