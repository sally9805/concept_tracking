One May 7 , 1915 Happily unaware he 'd be dead in twenty-three minutes , Henry W. Wyley imagined pinching the nicely rounded rump of the young blonde who was directly in his line of sight . It was a perfectly harmless fantasy that did nothing to distress the blonde , or Henry 's wife , and put Henry himself in the best of moods . With a lap robe tucked around his pudgy knees and a plump belly well satisfied by a late and luxurious lunch , he sat in the bracing sea air with his wife , Edith-whose bum , bless her , was flat as a pancake-enjoying the blonde 's derriere along with a fine cup of Earl Grey . Henry , a portly man with a robust laugh and an eye for the ladies , did n't bother to stir himself to join other passengers at the rail for a glimpse of Ireland 's shimmering coast . He 'd seen it before and assumed he 'd have plenty of opportunities to see it again if he cared to . Though what fascinated people about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urbanite who preferred the solidity of steel and concrete . And at this particular moment , he was much more interested in the dainty chocolate cookies served with the tea than with the vista . Particularly when the blonde moved on . Though Edith fussed at him not to make a pig of himself , he gobbled up three cookies with cheerful relish . Edith , being Edith , refrained . It was a pity she denied herself that small pleasure in the last moments of her life , but she would die as she 'd lived , worrying about her husband 's extra tonnage and brushing at the crumbs that scattered carelessly on his shirtfront . Henry , however , was a man who believed in indulgence . What , after all , was the point of being richif you did n't treat yourself to the finer things ? He 'd been poor , and he 'd been hungry . Rich and well fed was better . He 'd never been handsome , but when a man had money he was called substantial rather than fat , interesting rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At just before three in the afternoon on that sparkling May day , the wind blew at his odd little coal-colored toupee , whipped high , happy color into his pudgy cheeks . He had a gold watch in his pocket , a ruby pin in his tie . His Edith , scrawny as a chicken , was decked out in the best of Parisian couture . He was worth nearly three million . Not as much as Alfred Vanderbilt , who was crossing the Atlantic as well , but enough to content Henry . Enough , he thought with pride as he considered a fourth cookie , to pay for first-class accommodations on this floating palace . Enough to see that his children had received first-class educations and that his grandchildren would as well . He imagined first class was more important to him than it was to Vanderbilt . After all , Alfred had never had to make do with second . He listened with half an ear as his wife chattered on about plans once they reached England . Yes , they would pay calls and receive them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associates or hunting up stock for his business . He assured her of all this with his usual amiability , and because after nearly forty years of marriage he was deeply fond of his wife , he would see that she was well entertained during their stay abroad . But he had plans of his own , and that driving force had been the single purpose of this spring crossing . If his information was correct , he would soon acquire the second Fate . The small silver statue was a personal quest , one he 'd pursued since he 'd chanced to purchase the first of the reputed three . He had a line on the third as well and would tug on it as soon as the second statue was in his possession . When he had the complete set , well , that would be first class indeed . Wyley Antiques would be second to none . Personal and professional satisfaction , he mused . All because of three small silver ladies , worth a pretty penny separately . Worth beyond imagining together . Perhaps he 'd loan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he liked the idea . THE THREE FATES ON LOAN FROM THE PRIVATE COLLECTION OF HENRY W. WYLEY Edith would have her new hats , he thought , her dinner parties and her afternoon promenades . And he would have the prize of a lifetime . Sighing with satisfaction , Henry sat back to enjoy his last cup of Earl Grey . Felix Greenfield was a thief . He was neither ashamed nor prideful of it . It was simply what he was and had always been . And as Henry Wyley assumed he 'd have other opportunities to gaze upon the Irish coast , Felix assumed he 'd remain a thief for many years to come . He was good at his work-not brilliant at it , he 'd be the first to admit , but good enough to make ends meet . Good enough , he thought as he moved quickly down the corridors of first class in his stolen steward 's uniform , to have gathered the means for third-class passage back to England . Things were just a bit hot professionally back in New York , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not that it had been his fault , not entirely . His only failing had been to break his own first rule and take on an associate for the job . Bad choice , as his temporary partner had broken another primary rule . Never steal what is n't easily , discreetly fenced . Greed had blinded old Two-Pint Monk , Felix thought with a sigh as he let himself into the Wyley stateroom . What had the man been thinking , laying sticky fingers on a diamond-and-sapphire necklace ? Then behaving like a bloody amateur by getting drunk as a sailor-on his usual two pints of lager-and bragging over it . Well , Two-Pint would do his bragging in jail now , though there 'd be no lager to loosen his idiot tongue . But the bastard had chirped like the stool pigeon he was and given Felix 's name to the coppers . It had seemed best to take a nice ocean voyage , and what better place to get lost than on a ship as big as a damn city ? He 'd been a bit concerned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Germans stalking the seas had given him some pause . But they were such vague , distant threats . The New York police and the idea of a long stretch behind bars were much more personal and immediate problems . In any case , he could n't believe a grand ship like the Lusitania would cross if there was any real danger . Not with all those wealthy people on board . It was a civilian vessel after all , and he was sure the Germans had better things to do than threaten a luxury liner , especially when there was a large complement of American citizens on board . He 'd been lucky indeed to have snagged a ticket , to have lost himself among all the passengers with the cops two steps behind him and closing . But he 'd had to leave quickly , and had spent nearly all his wherewithal for the ticket . Certainly there were opportunities galore to pluck a bit of this , a bit of that on such a fine , luxurious vessel filled with such fine , luxurious people . Cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never the wrong size or the wrong color . Inside the stateroom , he let out a low whistle . Imagine it , he thought , taking a moment to dream . Just imagine traveling in such style . He knew less about the architecture and design of where he was standing than a flea knew about the breed of dog it bit . But he knew it was choice . The sitting room was larger than the whole of his third-class accommodations , and the bedroom beyond a wonder . Those who slept here knew nothing about the cramped space , the dark corners and the smells of third class . He did n't begrudge them their advantages . After all , if there were n't people who lived high , he 'd have no one to steal from , would he ? Still , he could n't waste time gawking and dreaming . It was already a few minutes before three , and if the Wyleys were true to form , the woman would wander back before four for her afternoon nap . He had delicate hands and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Big bucks , he figured , they 'd leave in the purser 's keeping . But fine ladies and gentlemen enjoyed having a roll of bills close at hand for flashing . He found an envelope already marked STEWARD and , grinning , ripped it open to find crisp dollar bills in a generous tip . He tucked it in the trouser pocket of his borrowed uniform . Within ten minutes , he 'd found and claimed nearly a hundred fifty dollars and a pair of nice garnet earbobs left carelessly in a silk evening purse . He did n't touch the jewelry cases-the man 's or the woman 's . That was asking for trouble . But as he sifted neatly through socks and drawers , his fingers brushed over a solid lump wrapped in velvet cloth . Lips pursed , Felix gave in to curiosity and spread open the cloth . He did n't know anything about art , but he recognized pure silver when he had his hands on it . The lady-for it was a woman-was small enough to fit in his palm . She held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was garbed in a kind of robe . She had a lovely face and form . Fetching , he would have said , though she looked a bit too cool and calculating for his personal taste in females . He preferred them a bit slow of wit and cheerful of disposition . Tucked in with her was a paper with a name and address , and the scrawled notation : Contact for second Fate . Felix pondered over it , committed the note to memory out of habit . It could be another chicken for plucking once he was in London . He started to wrap her again , replace her where he 'd found her , but he just stood there turning her over and over in his hands . Throughout his long career as a thief , he 'd never once allowed himself to envy , to crave , to want an object for himself . What was taken was always a means to an end , and nothing more . But Felix Greenfield , lately of Hell 's Kitchen and bound for the alleyways and tenements of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship with the Irish coast even now in view out the windows , and wanted the small silver woman for his own . She was so . . . pretty . And fit so well in his hand with the metal already warming against his palm . Such a little thing . Who would miss her ? " Do n't be stupid , " he muttered , wrapped her in velvet again . " Take the money , mate , and move along . " Before he could replace her , he heard what he thought was a peal of thunder . The floor beneath his feet seemed to shudder . Nearly losing his balance as the ship shook side to side , he stumbled toward the door , the velvet-cloaked statue still in his hand . Without thinking , he jammed it into his trouser pocket , spilled out into the corridor as the floor rose under him . There was a sound now , not like thunder , but like a great hammer flung down from heaven to strike the ship . Felix ran for his life . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ship dipped sharply and had him tumbling down the corridor like dice in a cup . He could hear shouting and the pounding of feet . And he tasted blood in his mouth , seconds before it went dark . His first wild thought was , Iceberg ! as he remembered what had befallen the great Titanic . But surely in the broad light of a spring afternoon , so close to the Irish coast , such a thing was n't possible . He never thought of the Germans . He never thought of war . He scrambled up , slamming into walls in the pitch black of the corridor , stumbling over his own feet and the stairs , and spilled out on deck with a flood of others . Already lifeboats were being launched and there were cries of terror along with shouted orders for women and children to board them . How bad was it ? he wondered frantically . How bad could it be when he could see the shimmering green of the coastline ? Even as he tried to calm himself , the ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Its screaming passengers were hurled into the sea . He saw a mass of faces-some torn , some scalded , all horrified . There were piles of debris on deck , and passengers-bleeding , screaming-trapped under it . Some , he saw with dull shock , were already beyond screams . And there on the listing desk of the great ship , Felix smelled what he 'd often smelled in Hell 's Kitchen . He smelled death . Women clutched children , babies , and wept or prayed . Men ran in panic , or fought madly to drag the injured clear of debris . Through the chaos stewards and stewardesses hurried , passing out life jackets with a kind of steady calm . They might have been handing out teacups , he thought , until one rushed by him . " Go on , man ! Do your job ! See to the passengers . " It took Felix one blank moment before he remembered he was still wearing the stolen steward 's uniform . And another before he understood , truly understood , they were sinking . Fuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screams and prayers . We 're dying . There were shouts from the water , desperate cries for help . Felix fought his way to the rail and , looking down , saw bodies floating , people floundering in debris-strewn water . People drowning in it . He saw another lifeboat being launched , wondered if he could somehow make the leap into it and save himself . He struggled to pull himself to a higher point , to gain ground was all he could think . To stay on his feet until he could hurl himself into a lifeboat and survive . He saw a well-dressed man take off his own life jacket and put it around a weeping woman . So the rich could be heroes , he thought . They could afford to be . He 'd sooner be alive . The deck tilted again , sent him sliding along with countless others toward the mouth of the sea . He shot out a hand , managed to grab the rail with his clever thief 's fingers and cling . And his free hand closed , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went tumbling by . Muttering wild prayers of thanks , he started to strap it on . It was a sign , he thought with his heart and eyes wheeling wild , a sign from God that he was meant to survive this . As his shaking fingers fumbled with the jacket , he saw the woman wedged between upturned deck chairs . And the child , the small , angelic face of the child she clutched against her . She was n't weeping . She was n't screaming . She simply held and rocked the little boy as if lulling him into his afternoon nap . " Mary , mother of God . " And cursing himself for a fool , Felix crawled across the pitched deck . He dragged and heaved at the chairs that pinned her down . " I 've hurt my leg . " She continued to stroke her child 's hair , and the rings on her fingers sparkled in the strong spring sunlight . Though her voice was calm , her eyes were huge , glazed with shock and pain , and the terror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think I can walk . Will you take my baby ? Please , take my little boy to a lifeboat . See him safe . " He had one moment , one heartbeat to choose . And while the world went to hell around them , the child smiled . " Put this on yourself , missus , and hold tight to the boy . " " We 'll put it on my son . " " It 's too big for him . It wo n't help him . " " I 've lost my husband . " She spoke in those clear , cultured tones , and though her eyes were glassy , they stayed level on his as Felix pushed her arms through the life jacket . " He fell over the rail . I fear he 's dead . " " You 're not , are you ? Neither is the boy . " He could smell the child-powder , youth , innocence-through the stench of panic and death . " What 's his name ? " " Name ? He 's Steven . Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get you and Steven Edward Cunningham , the Third , to a lifeboat . " " We 're sinking . " " That 's the God 's truth . " He dragged her , trying once more to reach the high side of the ship . He crawled , clawed his way over the wet and rising deck . " Hold on tight to Mama , Steven , " he heard her say . Then she crawled and clawed with him while terror raged around them . " Do n't be frightened . " She crooned it , though her breath was coming fast with the effort . Her heavy skirts sloshed in the water , and blood smeared over the glinting stones on her fingers . " You have to be brave . Do n't let go of Mama , no matter what . " He could see the boy , no more than three , cling like a monkey to his mother 's neck . Watching her face , Felix thought as he strained for another inch of height , as if all the answers in all the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God knew what , rained down from the deck above . He dragged her another inch , another , a foot . " Just a little farther . " He gasped it out , without any idea if it were true . Something struck him hard in the back . And his hold on her slipped . " Missus ! " he shouted , grabbed blindly , but caught only the pretty silk sleeve of her dress . As it ripped , he stared at her helplessly . " God bless you , " she managed and , wrapping both arms tight around her son , slid over the edge of the world into the water . He barely had time to curse before the deck heaved and he pitched in after her . The cold , the sheer brutality of it , stole his breath . Blind , already going numb with shock , he kicked wildly , clawing for the surface as he 'd clawed for the deck . When he broke through , gasped in that first gulp of air , he found he 'd plunged into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all around him . He was jammed into an island of bobbing , staring white faces , of screams from the drowning . The water was strewn with planks and chairs , wrecked lifeboats and crates . His limbs were already stiff with cold when he struggled to heave as much of his body as possible onto a crate and out of the freezing water . And what he saw was worse . There were hundreds of bodies floating in the still sparkling sunlight . While his stomach heaved out the sea he 'd swallowed , he floundered in the direction of a waterlogged lifeboat . The swell , somehow gentle , tore at the island and spread death over the sea , and dragged him , with merciless hands , away from the lifeboat . The great ship , the floating palace , was sinking in front of his eyes . Dangling from it were lifeboats , useless as toys . Somehow it astonished him to see there were still people on the decks . Some were kneeling , others still rushing in panic from a fate that was hurtling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like dolls into the sea . And the huge black funnels tipped down toward the water , down to where he clung to a broken crate . When those funnels touched the sea , water gushed into them , sucking in people with it . Not like this , he thought as he kicked weakly . A man was n't meant to die like this . But the sea dragged him under , pulled him in . Water seemed to boil around him as he struggled . He choked on it , tasted salt and oil and smoke . And realized , as his body bashed into a solid wall , that he was trapped in one of the funnels , would die there like a rat in a blocked chimney . As his lungs began to scream , he thought of the woman and the boy . Since he deemed it useless to pray for himself , he offered what he thought was his last plea to God that they 'd survived . Later , he would think it had been as if hands had taken hold of him and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was expelled , flying out on a filthy gush of soot . With pain radiating through him , he snagged a floating plank and pulled his upper body onto it . He laid his cheek on the wood , breathed deeply , wept quietly . And saw the Lusitania was gone . The plate of water where she 'd been was raging , thrashing and belching smoke . Belching bodies , he saw with a dull horror . He 'd been one of them , only moments before . But fate had spared him . While he watched , while he struggled to block out the screams and stay sane , the water went calm as glass . With the last of his strength , he pulled himself onto the plank . He heard the shrill song of sea gulls , the weeping prayers or weeping cries of those who floundered or floated in the water with him . Probably freeze to death , he thought as he drifted in and out of consciousness . But it was better than drowning . It was the cold that brought him out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and every trickling breeze was a new agony . Hardly daring to move , he tugged at his sopping and ruined steward 's jacket . Bright pain had nausea rolling greasily in his belly . He ran an unsteady hand over his face and saw the wet was n't water , but blood . His laugh was wild and shaky . So what would it be , freezing or bleeding to death ? Drowning might have been better , after all . It would be over that way . He slowly shed the jacket-something wrong with his shoulder , he thought absently-and used the ruined jacket to wipe the blood from his face . He did n't hear so much shouting now . There were still some thin screams , some moans and prayers , but most of the passengers who 'd made it as far as he had were dead . And silent . He watched a body float by . It took him a moment to recognize the face , as it was bone-white and covered with bloodless gashes . Wyley . Good Christ . For the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weight in his pocket . He felt the lump of what he 'd stolen from the man currently staring up at the sky with blank blue eyes . " You wo n't need it , " Felix said between chattering teeth , " but I swear before God if I had it to do over , I would n't have stolen from you in the last moments of your life . Seems like robbing a grave . " His long-lapsed religious training had him folding his hands in prayer . " If I end up dying here today , I 'll apologize in person if we end up on the same side of the gate . And if I live I take a vow to try to reform . No point in saying I 'll do it , but I 'll give doing an honest day 's work a try . " He passed out again , and woke to the sound of an engine . Dazed , numb , he managed to lift his head . Through his wavering vision , he saw a boat , and through the roaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men . He tried to call out , but managed only a hacking cough . " I 'm alive . " His voice was only a croak , whisked away by the breeze . " I 'm still alive . " He did n't feel the hands pull him onto the fishing trawler called Dan O'Connell . Was delirious with chills and pain when he was wrapped in a blanket , when hot tea was poured down his throat . He would remember nothing about his actual rescue , nor learn the names of the men whose arms had hauled him to safety . Nothing came clear to him until he woke , nearly twenty-four hours after the torpedo had struck the liner , in a narrow bed in a small room with sunlight streaming through a window . He would never forget the first sight that greeted him when his vision cleared . She was young and pretty , with eyes of misty blue and a scatter of gold freckles over her small nose and round cheeks . Her hair was fair and piled on top of her head in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her mouth bowed up when she glanced over at him , and she rose quickly from the chair where she 'd been darning socks . " There you are . I wonder if you 'll stay with us this time around . " He heard Ireland in her voice , felt the strong hand lift his head . And he smelled a drift of lavender . " What . . . " The old , croaking sound of his voice appalled him . His throat felt scorched , his head stuffed with rags of dirty cotton . " Just take this first . It 's medicine the doctor left for you . You 've pneumonia , he says , and a fair gash on your head that 's been stitched . Seems you tore something in your shoulder as well . But you 've come through the worst , sir , and you rest easy for we 'll see you through . " " What . . . happened ? The ship . . . " The pretty mouth went flat and hard . " The bloody Germans . ' T @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hell for it , for the people they murdered . The babies they slaughtered . " Though a tear trickled down her cheek , she managed to slide the medicine into him competently . " You have to rest . Your life 's a miracle , for there are more than a thousand dead . " " A . . . " He managed to grip her wrist as the horror stabbed through him . " A thousand ? " " More than . You 're in Queenstown now , and as well as you can be . " She tilted her head . " An American , are you ? " Close enough , he decided , as he had n't seen the shores of his native England in more than twelve years . " Yes . I need- " " Tea , " she interrupted . " And broth . " She moved to the door to shout : " Ma ! He 's waked and seems to want to stay that way . " She glanced back . " I 'll be back with something warm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Me ? " She smiled again , wonderfully sunny . " I 'd be Meg . Meg O'Reiley , and you 're in the home of my parents , Pat and Mary O'Reiley , where you 're welcome until you 're mended . And your name , sir ? " " Greenfield . Felix Greenfield . " " God bless you , Mr. Greenfield . " " Wait . . . there was a woman , and a little boy . Cunningham . " Pity moved over her face . " They 're listing names . I 'll check on them for you when I 'm able . Now you rest , and we 'll get you some tea . " When she went out , he turned his face toward the window , toward the sun . And saw , sitting on the table under it , the money that had been in his pocket , the garnet earbobs . And the bright silver glint of the little statue . Felix laughed until he cried . He learned the O'Reileys made their living from the sea . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rescue effort . He met them all , and her younger sister as well . For the first day he was unable to keep any of them straight in his mind . But for Meg herself . He clung to her company as he 'd clung to the plank , to keep from sliding into the dark again . " Tell me what you know , " he begged her . " It 'll be hard for you to hear it . It 's hard to speak it . " She moved to his window , looked out at the village where she 'd lived all of her eighteen years . Survivors such as Felix were being tended to in hotel rooms , in the homes of neighbors . And the dead , God rest them , were laid in temporary morgues . Some would be buried , some would be sent home . Others would forever be in the grave of the sea . " When I heard of it , " she began , " I almost did n't believe it . How could such a thing be ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to rescue survivors . More boats set out from here . Most were too late to do more than bring back the dead . Oh sweet God , I saw myself some of the people as they made land . Women and babies , men barely able to walk and half naked . Some cried , and others just stared . Like you do when you 're lost . They say the liner went down in less than twenty minutes . Can that be ? " " I do n't know , " Felix murmured , and shut his eyes . She glanced back at him and hoped he was strong enough for the rest . " More have died since coming here . Exposure and injuries too grievous to heal . Some spent hours in the water . The lists change so quick . I ca n't think what terror of heart families are living with , waiting to know . Or what grief those who know their loved ones are lost in this horrible way are feeling . You said there was no one waiting for word of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went to him . She 'd tended his hurts , suffered with him during the horrors of his delirium . It had been only three days since he 'd been brought into her care , but for both of them , it was a lifetime . " There 's no shame in staying here , " she said quietly . " No shame in not going to the funeral today . You 're far from well yet . " " I need to go . " He looked down at his borrowed clothes . In them he felt scrawny and fragile . And alive . The quiet was almost unearthly . Every shop and store in Queenstown was closed for the day . No children raced along the streets , no neighbors stopped to chat or gossip . Over the silence came the hollow sound of church bells from St. Colman 's on the hill , and the mournful notes of the funeral dirge . Felix knew if he lived another hundred years he 'd never forget the sounds of that grieving music , the soft and steady beat of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the instruments , and remembered how that same sun had struck the brass of the propellers as the stern of the Lusitania had reared up in her final plunge into the sea . He was alive , he thought again . Instead of relief and gratitude , he felt only guilt and despair . He kept his head down as he trudged along behind the priests , the mourners , the dead , through the reverently silent streets . It took more than an hour to reach the graveyard , and left him light-headed . By the time he saw the three mass graves beneath tall elms where choirboys stood with incense burners , he was forced to lean heavily on Meg . Tears stung the backs of his eyes as he looked at the tiny coffins that held dead children . He listened to the quiet weeping , to the words of both the Catholic and the Church of Ireland services . None of it reached him . He could still hear , thought he would forever hear , the way people had called to God as they 'd drowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them die horribly . Then he lifted his head and , across those obscene holes , saw the face of the woman and young boy from the ship . The tears came now , fell down his cheeks like rain as he lurched through the crowd . He reached her as the first notes of " Abide With Me " lifted into the air . Then he fell to his knees in front of her wheelchair . " I feared you were dead . " She reached up , touched his face with one hand . The other peeked out of a cast . " I never got your name , so could n't check the lists . " " You 're alive . " Her face had been cut , he could see that now , and her color was too bright , as if she were feverish . Her leg had been cast as well as her arm . " And the boy . " The child slept in the arms of another woman . Like an angel , Felix thought again . Peaceful and unmarked . The fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one prayer , had been answered . " He never let go . " She began to weep then , soundlessly . " He 's such a good boy . He never let go .

" " I 'm sorry . " " He would have thanked you . " She reached up to touch a hand to her boy 's leg . " He loved his son , very much . " She took a deep breath . " In his stead , I thank you , for my son 's life and my own . Please tell me your name . " " Felix Greenfield , ma'am . " " Mr. Greenfield . " She leaned over , brushed a kiss on Felix 's cheek .

You saved her life , and the little boy 's . " Concerned , she hurried up to him , took his arm to steady him . He 'd have shaken her off if he 'd had the strength . Instead , he simply sat in the high , wild grass of the graveyard and buried his face in his hands . " Ah , there now . " Pity for him had her sitting beside him , taking him into her arms .

" " Who can answer ? But there 's a child who 's alive today because you were there . Would you have been , do you think , just where you were , when you were , if you had n't been stealing ?
