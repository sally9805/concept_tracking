AUGUST 21 <br> 5:27 P.M. <br> " Captain , Mister Grafton is attempting to put a man ashore , sir . " <br> " Which man , Mister Eaton ? " <br> Three hundred yards off the island 's sheer wall , H.M.S. Retribution rolled on a ten foot swell setting away from the shore . The corvette was hove to , her gray sails billowing in opposite directions to hold her position on the sea as the sailing master kept an eye on a growing bank of cloud to the north . <br> Watching from the decks in silence , some of the men were praying as a boat approached the cliff . Lit pale orange by the setting sun , the palisade was bisected by a blue shadowed crevasse that streaked seven hundred feet up its face . <br> The Retribution was a captured French ship previously called the Atrios . For the past ten months , her crew had been relentlessly hunting H.M.S. Bounty . While the British admiralty did not object to stealing ships from other navies , they had a long memory for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been five years since the mutineers had absconded with the Bounty , and still the hunt continued . <br> Lieutenant Eaton steadied the captain 's telescope and twisted the brass drawtube to focus the image : nine men were positioning the rowboat under the crack in the cliff . Eaton noticed that the seaman reaching up toward the fissure wore a scarlet cap . " It looks like Frears , Captain , " he reported . <br> The dark crack started about fifteen feet above the bottom of the swell and zigzagged hundreds of feet across the face of jagged rock like a bolt of lightning . The British sailors had nearly circled the two-mile-wide island before finding this one chink in its armor . <br> Though the captain insisted that they thoroughly investigate all islands for signs of the Bounty 's crew , a more pressing matter concerned the men of the Retribution now . After five weeks with no rain , they were praying for freshwater , not signs of mutineers . As they pretended to attend their duties , 317 men stole furtive , hopeful looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the spray as the nine men staved off the cliff with oars . At the top of one swell the man wearing the red cap grabbed the bottom edge of the fissure : he dangled there as the boat receded . <br> " He 's got a purchase , Captain ! " <br> A tentative cheer went up from the crew . <br> Eaton saw the men in the boat hurling small barrels up to Frears . " Sir , the men are throwing him some barrecoes to fill ! " <br> " Providence has smiled on us , Captain , " said Mister Dunn , the ruddy chaplain , who had taken passage aboard Retribution on his way to Australia . " We were surely meant to find this island ! Else , why would the Lord have put it here , so far away from everything ? " <br> " Aye , Mister Dunn . Keep a close counsel with the Lord , " replied the captain as he slitted his eyes and watched the boat . " How 's our man , Mister Eaton ? " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length of time , Eaton saw the scarlet capped man finally emerge from the shadow . " Frears 's signaling . . . He 's found freshwater , Captain ! He 's throwing down the barrecoe ! " <br> Eaton looked at the captain wearily , then smiled as a cheer broke over the decks . <br> The captain cracked a smile . " Ready four landing boats for provisioning , Mister Eaton . Let 's rig a ladder and fill our barrels . " <br> " It 's Providence , Captain , " cried the chaplain over the answering cheer of the men . " ' T is the good Lord who led us here ! " <br> Eaton put the spyglass to his eye and saw Frears toss another small barrel from the fissure into the sea . The men in the longboat hauled it alongside . <br> " He 's thrown down another ! " Eaton shouted . <br> The men cheered again . They were now moving about and laughing as barrels were hauled up from the hold . <br> " The Lord keeps us . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chin . <br> The captain smiled in the chaplain 's direction , knowing that he 'd had the shock of his life these past months observing life aboard a working ship in the King 's navy . <br> With a face as freckled as the Milky Way , Captain Ambrose Spencer Henders resembled a redheaded Nelson , the hero of Trafalgar , to his crew . " An island this size without breakers , birds , or seals , " he grumbled . He stared at the faint colors swirled in the island 's cliff . Some bands of color seemed to glitter as if with gold in the last light of the setting sun . After sounding all around the island they had found no place to anchor , and that fact alone baffled him . " What do you make of this island , Mister Eaton ? " <br> " Aye , it 's strange , " Eaton said , lowering the glass  --  but a glimpse of Frears falling to his knees at the edge of the crevasse made him raise it hastily to his eye . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and saw him drop what appeared to be the copper funnel he was using to fill the small kegs . The funnel skittered down the rock face into the water . <br> A red flash appeared at the sailor 's back . Red jaws seemed to lunge from the twilight and close over Frears 's chest and head from each side , jerking him backwards . <br> Faint shouts drifted over the waves , echoing off the cliff . <br> " Captain ! " <br> " Eh , what is it ? " <br> " I 'm not sure , sir ! " <br> Eaton tried to steady the scope as the deck rolled . Between waves he saw another man in the longboat catch hold of the lip of the fissure and scramble up into the shadow of the crack . <br> " They 've sent another man up ! " <br> Another swell blocked his view . A moment later , another rolled under the ship . As the deck rose , Eaton barely caught the image of the second man leaping out of the crevasse into the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to the boat ! " <br> " What in blazes is going on , Mister Eaton ? " Captain Henders lifted a midshipman 's scope to his eye . <br> " The men are hauling him into the boat . They 're coming back , sir , with some haste ! " Eaton lowered the glass , still staring at the fissure , now doubting what he had seen . <br> " Is Frears safe , then ? " <br> " I do n't believe so , Captain , " Eaton replied . <br> " What 's the matter ? " <br> The lieutenant shook his head . <br> Captain Henders watched the men in the boat row in great lunges back to the ship . The man who had jumped into the water was propped up against the transom , seemingly stricken by some fit as his mates struggled to subdue him . " Tell me what you saw , Mister Eaton , " he ordered . <br> " I do n't know , sir . " <br> The captain lowered the scope and gave his first officer a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they drew near the Retribution . <br> The captain turned to the chaplain . " What say you , Mister Dunn ? " <br> From the crack in the cliff face came a rising and falling howl like a wolf or a whale , and Mister Dunn 's ruddy jowls paled as the ungodly voice devolved into what sounded like the gooing and spluttering of some giant baby . Then it shrieked a riot of piercing notes like a broken calliope . <br> The men stared at the cliff in stunned silence . <br> Mister Grafton shouted from the approaching boat : " Captain Henders ! " <br> " What is it , man ? " <br> " The Devil Hisself ! " <br> The captain looked at his first officer , who was not a man given to superstition . <br> Eaton nodded grimly . " Aye , Captain . " <br> The voice from the crack splintered as more unearthly voices joined it in a chorus of insanity . <br> " We should leave this place , Captain , " urged Mister Dunn . " ' T is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , why would the Lord have put it here , so far away from everything ? " <br> Captain Henders stared distractedly at his chaplain , then said , " Mister Graves , hoist the boat and make sail , due east ! " Then he turned to all his officers . " Chart the island . But make no mention of water or what we have found here today . God forbid we give a soul any reason to seek this place . " <br> The hideous gibberish shrieking from the crack in the island continued . <br> " Aye , Captain ! " his officers answered , ashen-faced . <br> As the men scrambled from the boat , the captain asked , " Mister Grafton , what has become of Mister Frears ? " <br> " He 's been et by monsters , sor ! " <br> Captain Henders paled under his freckles . " Master gunner , place a full broadside on that crevice , double shot , round and grape , if you please ! As you 're ready , sir ! " <br> The master gunner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aye , sir ! " <br> Retribution fired a parting shot into the crevasse on lances of fire and smoke as she came about , blasting the cliffs like a castle 's ramparts. <br> <br> 9:02 P.M. <br> Captain Ambrose Spencer Henders dipped a kite feather quill into the porcelain inkwell on his desk and stared down at the blank page of his logbook . The oil lamp swung like a pendulum , moving the shadow of the quill across the paper as he paused , weighing what to write . <br> <br> PRESENT DAY <br> AUGUST 22 <br> 2:10 P.M. <br> <br> The Trident cut the deep water with her single-hulled bow and turned three wakes with her trimaran stern . She resembled a sleek spacecraft leaving three white rocket trails across a blue universe . The storm clouds that had driven her south for three weeks had vanished overnight . The sea reflected a spotless dome of scorching blue sky . <br> The 182-foot exploration vessel was approaching the center of 36 million square miles of empty ocean that stretched from the equator to Antarctica  --  a void that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words " South Pacific Ocean . " <br> Chartered for the cable reality show SeaLife , the Trident comfortably quartered forty passengers . Now an " on camera " crew of ten who pretended to run the ship , fourteen professionals who really ran the ship , six scientists , and eight production staffers , along with a handsome bull terrier named Copepod , rounded out her manifest . <br> SeaLife was chronicling the Trident 's yearlong around-the-world odyssey , which promised to encounter the most exotic and remote places on Earth . In its first four weekly episodes the cast of fresh young scientists and hip young crew had explored the Galapagos Islands and Easter Island , launching SeaLife to number two in the cable ratings . After the last three weeks at sea , however , enduring back-to-back storms , the show was foundering . <br> The ship 's botanist , Nell Duckworth , glared at her reflection in the port window of the Trident 's bridge , repositioning her Mets cap . Like all the other scientists chosen for the show , Nell was in her late twenties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had celebrated over the **25;112;TOOLONG bowl of a marine toilet . She had lost weight , since she had n't been able to keep food down for the last ten days . Her motion sickness had subsided only when the last of the massive storms had passed last night , leaving a cleansed blue sea and sky this morning . So far , bad weather , sunblock , and her trusty Mets cap had protected her fair complexion from any radical new pigmentation events . But she was not checking her reflection for wrinkles , weight loss , or freckles . Instead , all she noticed was the look of despair glaring back at her from the glass . <br> Nell wore taupe knee length cargo jeans , a gray T-shirt , and plenty of SPF24 sunblock slathered on her bare arms and face . Her beat up white Adidas sneakers annoyed the producers since Adidas was not one of the show 's sponsors , but she had stubbornly refused to trade them in . <br> She gazed south through the window , and the crushing disappointment she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Due to weather delays and low ratings , they were bypassing the island that lay just beyond that horizon  --  bypassing the only reason Nell had tried out for this show in the first place . <br> For the past few hours , she had been trying not to remind the men on the bridge of the fact that they were closer than all but a handful of people had ever come to the place she had studied and theorized about for over nine years . <br> Instead of heading one day south and landing , they were heading west to Pitcairn Island , where the descendants of the Bounty 's mutineers had apparently been planning a party for them . <br> Nell gritted her teeth and caught her reflection scowling back at her . She turned and looked out the stern window . <br> She saw the mini sub resting under a crane on the ship 's center pontoon . Underwater viewing ports were built into the port and starboard pontoons  --  Nell 's favorite lunch spots , where she had seen occasional blue-water fish like tuna , marlin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trident boasted a state-of-the-art television production studio and satellite communication station ; its own desalinization plant , which produced three thousand gallons of freshwater daily ; a working oceanographic lab with research grade microscopes and a wide spectrum of laboratory instruments ; even a movie theater . But it was much ado about nothing , she thought . The show 's scientific premise had been nothing but window dressing , as the cynic in her had chided her from the start . <br> On the poop deck below , she watched the ship 's marine biologist , Andy Beasley , trying to teach the weather-beaten crew a lesson in sea life . <br> <br> 2:11 P.M. <br> <br> Andrew Beasley was a gangly , narrow-shouldered scientist with a mop of blond hair and thick framed tortoise-shell glasses . His long , birdlike face often displayed an optimistic smile . <br> Raised by his beloved but alcoholic Aunt Althea in New Orleans , the gentle young scientist had grown up surrounded by aquariums , for he lived over his aunt 's seafood restaurant . Any specimens that came under his study were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live out Althea 's dream of becoming a marine biologist , e-mailing her every day from the moment he left home for college to the day he accepted his first research position . <br> Aunt Althea had passed away three months ago . After surviving Hurricane Katrina , she had succumbed to pancreatic cancer , leaving Andy more alone than he had thought possible after feeling so terribly alone all his life . <br> One month after her funeral , he had received a letter inviting him to audition for SeaLife . Without telling him , Althea had sent his curriculum vitae and a photo to the show 's producers after reading an article about the casting call for marine biologists . Andy had visited his aunt 's grave to put flowers on it , flown to New York , and auditioned . As if it were Aunt Althea 's last wish being granted , he had won one of the highly contested berths aboard the Trident . <br> Andy usually wore bright clashing colors that gave him a slightly clownish appearance . It also made him a natural target @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily crushed as a puppy  --  a combination that drew out a maternal impulse in Nell that was surprising to her . <br> Andy fidgeted with the wireless mike pinned to his skinny yellow leather tie . He wore a Lacoste **49;139;TOOLONG shirt , which resembled Fruit Stripe gum . Paired with the vertically striped shirt , he wore Tommy Hilfiger boardshorts with horizontal blue , green , pink , red , orange , and yellow stripes . To set it all off , he wore green size-11 high-top sneakers . <br> Continues ...
