Opponents ' proposals call for tax increases , benefit cuts , and/or government investing . // WHILE PROPOSALS for privatizing Social Security have been much debated , there has been far less discussion of the alternatives . Indeed , opponents of privatization often critique it as if such proposals existed in a vacuum . Critics compare privatization proposals with " current law " and suggest that they will provide lower benefits or at least lower government-provided benefits . Or , they suggest that the costs of transition to a privatized system will require tax increases . However , as Charles Blahous , executive director of the President 's Commission to Strengthen Social Security , has pointed out , " Ibe essential problem with comparing reform plans with current law ' is that current law ' allows the system to go bankrupt . " Impending bankruptcy is not the sole problem facing Social Security . Payroll taxes are already so high that younger workers will receive an extraordinarily poor rate of return . In addition , Social Security contains a host of inequities that penalize working women , minorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only on insolvency . They implicitly assume that the structure of the current program is fine and the changes needed are merely in its financing . Therefore , the solutions they offer generally do not deal with establishing property rights , making benefits fairer to women and/ or minorities , allowing low-wage workers to accumulate wealth , or even increasing rates of return . Yet , even judging by their own limited standards , opponents of privatization offer few concrete proposals . Pres. Bill Clinton identified the limited range of options available to restore Social Security to solvency : raise taxes , cut benefits , or get a higher rate of return through investment in real capital assets . Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution , an opponent of privatization , agrees . " Increased funding to raise pension reserves is possible only with some combination of additional tax revenues , reduced benefits , or increased investment returns from investing in higher yielding assets , " he told Congress in 1999 . The question , then , is , since opponents of privatization have rejected individual investment to earn a higher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they support-raising taxes , cutting benefits , or some nonindividual form of investment ? As Reps . Jim Kolbe ( R.-Ariz. ) and Charles Stenholm ( D.-Tex. ) pointed out in a letter to the bipartisan Congressional leadership in November , 2001 , " All participants in the debate over the future of Social Security must be held to the same standard so that the different approaches to strengthening Social Security can be compared on a level playing field . " Nevertheless , few , if any , opponents of privatization have put an actual scoreable proposal on the table . Indeed , the President 's Commission to Strengthen Social Security specifically invited opponents to submit detailed proposals for reforming the system , offering to have those proposals scored by the Social Security Administration on the same basis as the commission 's own proposals . Yet , no opposition group chose to take advantage of the offer . Still , from their writing , testimony , and speeches , it is possible to piece together what opponents of individual accounts offer as an alternative . Generally , those proposals boil down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or government investing . All of them contain significant costs and risks for individuals and the American economy alike . Tax increases Not surprisingly , since their primary goal is to preserve the structure and benefits of the current system , the solution most commonly offered by opponents of privatization is some form of tax increase . The National Academy on an Aging Society suggests that there is no limit to the amount of taxes American society can bear if they are used for a good cause such as preserving Social Security . It specifically rejects the notion , widely accepted by economists , that total taxes should not exceed 20% of national income . Joseph White , a fellow with the Century Foundation and professor of public policy at Case Western University , takes a similar approach . In his 2001 book , False Alarm : Why the Greatest Threat to Social Security and Medicare Is the Campaign to " Save " Them , he argues : " We have a responsibility to maintain a decent society . Social Security and Medicare are part of that . We have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by cutting its expenditures ) with solving society 's . No matter where we started , cutting Social Security and Medicare would be good for the budget . Eliminating them would be better . But the government does not exist just for its budget . The government exists to make the country a better place to live . Social Security and Medicare do make this a better country , and they can and should be preserved from the attack on entitlements Ken Apfel , Social Security commissioner under Clinton , says that successful Social Security reform will require Americans to abandon the notion that " future tax revenues should not be increased-even modestly . " He warned in an Apr. 11 , 2001 , op-ed piece in the Washington Post that , " over the next several decades Social Security taxes are projected to decline by more than 10 percent as a percentage of GDP . With a doubling of the senior population , more revenue will be needed , not less . " Lisa Maatz , formerly of the Older Women 's League , argues that , " while not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in the solvency discussion . If it helps to preserve the universal nature of Social Security , where no individual is left to sink or swim on their own , it may be worth the cost . " This is ultimately the point , an admittedly philosophical one , of those who would raise taxes to preserve Social Security . They see Social Security as a good thing , and , therefore , in their view , we should be willing to pay whatever it takes to preserve the program in its current form . The first place to look for tax increases is the payroll tax itself . For example , Vincent Sombrotto , president of the National Association of Letter Carriers , has urged the President 's Commission to " reject the notion that taxes can never be raised to overcome the projected shortfalls in the Social Security Trust Fund . If Americans are living longer , why should n't we pay higher payroll taxes to handle it ? " // Former Social Security Commissioner Robert M. Ball , writing for the Century Foundation , proposes " moderately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Economic Policy Institute would not only raise payroll taxes , but would index them to future increases in longevity . Various levels of payroll tax increases are also supported by University of Notre Dame economist Teresa Ghilarducci , Mark Weisbrot of the Center on Economic and Policy Research , and Robert Myers , former chief actuary at the Social Security Administration , who suggests that they would not be " too terribly painful . " The tax increase needed to restore Social Security to solvency is extremely large . To maintain benefits after the system begins running a deficit in 2016 , the government must acquire new funds equivalent to $103 per worker . By 2030 , the added tax burden increases to $1,543 per worker , and it continues to rise thereafter . Tax increases of this magnitude would have a serious impact on the U.S. economy . A look at the last rounds of payroll tax hikes shows how increasing payroll taxes can destroy jobs and reduce economic growth . For instance , according to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , hikes between 1979 and 1982 resulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the 1988 and 1990 payroll tax increases by economists Gary and Aldona Robbins estimated 510,000 jobs lost permanently and a reduction of the U.S. gross domestic product ( GDP ) of $30,000,000,000 per year . The reason for this is that workers view payroll taxes as a " pure tax , " not as an investment . Higher payroll taxes create a " wedge " between what employers are able to pay and what employees are willing to accept , thereby lowering take-home wages and making employment less attractive . Projecting the potential impact of future tax increases is more difficult , but the CBO estimates that a five percent increase in payroll taxes would reduce marginal after-tax compensation by 10% . The CBO further concludes that every 10% drop in after-tax wages would lead to as much as a three percent contraction in the labor supply . This would , in turn , likely lead to an unspecified , but significant , decline in American GDP . Moreover , a payroll tax hike would fall heaviest on low-income workers , who are least able to afford it . According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland , increasing the payroll tax would result in a 3.8% rise in Social Security 's lifetime net tax rate for those in the lowest quintile of income . As an alternative to across-the-board payroll tax hikes , some have suggested targeting the increase to upper-income workers by removing the current cap on income subject to the tax . Currently , individuals pay Social Security taxes on the first $84,500 of wage income . Wages above that level is exempt from Social Security taxes ( though not Medicare payroll taxes ) . Approximately 84% of all wage income earned in the U.S. falls under that cap and is subject to the tax . It is unclear whether advocates of this approach would remove the cap altogether or simply raise it . The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare , for instance , suggests that the cap be raised so that 90% of covered earnings are subject to the tax , as does the AFL-CIO . Hans Reimer of the 2030 Center appears to advocate total repeal of the cap , as do the National Council @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research would remove the cap as well , but only on the employer 's portion of the payroll tax . Ball would raise the cap , but just to 87.5% of covered earnings . Advocates of raising or eliminating the cap on payroll taxes often suggest that the current level of covered wages is significantly below the roughly 90% of earnings subject to the tax in 1983 , at the time of the Greenspan Commission 's reform . What they fail to note , though , is that the 1983 rate was unnaturally high . In fact , from 1945 to 1965 , the proportion of wages covered by the payroll tax declined steadily from 88% to roughly 71% . However , beginning in 1965 , in order to pay for added benefits , the cap was gradually increased , reaching a high of 90% in 1983 . Since that time , it has again begun to decline , but still remains above the post-World War II average of 82.9% . The multiplicity of proposals and their vagueness make it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt that any change in the payroll tax cap would be a significant tax increase . In fact , total elimination of the cap would amount to the largest tax jump in U.S. history-$461,000,000,000 during the first five years . For workers with wages over the cap , it would come to an immediate 12.4% hike in their marginal tax rates , so that many of them would be paying more than half their income in Federal taxes alone . While the economic consequences of raising or eliminating the payroll tax cap would be less than those of an across-the-board tax hike , they would still be considerable . The Heritage Foundation estimates that removing the cap would reduce the rate of U.S. economic growth by two to three percent . Over the next 10 years , it would cost the U.S. economy nearly $136,000,000,000 in lost growth , and roughly 1,100,000 jobs would disappear . In exchange for this massive tax increase and its attendant costs , Social Security would gain very little . Even total repeal of the cap would extend the payroll tax solvency of Social Security merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also contained in proposals to redirect general tax revenue to Social Security . The result would be to rely not on payroll tax hikes , but increases in income or other taxes to make up for any gap in Social Security 's financing . Of course , tax increases are not necessary to support general revenue financing of Social Security . The Federal government could always reduce other spending and devote the savings to Social Security . Indeed , advocates of privatization have suggested that as a way to help finance the transition to a system of individual accounts . However , such spending reductions would be considerable , and most opponents of privatization are not advocates of cutting government spending . In fact , their statements and publications show that they are talking about an increase in income tax revenue . Instead of advocating new taxes , one common approach calls for repeal of the tax reductions that passed Congress in 2001 , but have not yet taken effect . One suspects that this position stems more from opposition to the tax cut than from concern about Social Security . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , meaning that Social Security will be running a surplus throughout the period during which they are in effect . Social Security 's deficit is predicted not to start until approximately 2016 . Presumably , then , when advocates of repealing the tax cut speak of applying the funds to Social Security , they mean somehow crediting the money to the Social Security Trust Fund . All of those proposals reflect a fundamental misunderstanding of the nature of the trust fund . Social Security payroll taxes are currently bringing in more revenue than the program pays out in benefits . After 2016 , the situation will reverse , with Social Security paying out more in benefits than it brings in through taxes . The surplus is used to purchase special issue Treasury bonds . The Social Security surplus used to purchase bonds becomes general revenue and is spent on the government 's annual general operating expenses . What remains behind in the trust fund is the bonds , plus an interest payment attributed to them ( also paid in bonds , rather than cash ) . Government bonds are , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise against future tax revenue . When the bonds become due , the government will have to repay them out of general revenue . Adding more money to the trust fund now would simply increase the number of bonds . The money from purchase of those bonds would revert to general revenue and be spent . It is an endless cycle that does nothing to change Social Security 's actual solvency . That is why the more-sophisticated proponents of tax increase would not actually apply the increased revenue to Social Security , but to paying down the national debt . As Robert Shapiro , former Under Secretary of Commerce in the Clinton Administration , explains , " Getting rid of the debt will save hundreds of billions of dollars a year in interest payments , significantly pushing back the day of reckoning on redeeming those trust fund assets ... If the next generation decides to borrow to redeem those assets , becoming debt-free first will make it a lot cheaper to do so . " In short , paying down the debt will save money currently spent on interest payments . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after 2016 . Moreover , if it becomes necessary to borrow in order to cover Social Security 's post-2016 shortfall , it will be easier to do so if the current national debt has been paid off . There is a kernel of truth to both these points , but eventually both fall short . Despite budget shortfalls caused by the slowing economy after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 and increased government spending , the Bush Administration still projects future non-Social Security surpluses , much of which would be dedicated to paying down the national debt . It is true , of course , that repaying government debt reduces the interest payments the government must pay each year . These savings in debt service costs could , in theory , assist in maintaining the solvency of the Social Security system , but the extent of the help should not be overestimated . In 2000 , the government paid approximately $225,000,000,000 to service the publicly held debt . If that debt were repaid ( or had never been run up in the first place ) , the government would have , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could increase spending or reduce taxes . How far would those interest savings take Social Security ? Assume that the publicly held debt is retired by 2016 , the year in which Social Security begins to run payroll tax deficits , thereby adding an extra $225,000,000,000 annually to Social Security 's balance sheets . While this would help , it would take just until 2021 for Social Security to run payroll tax deficits exceeding $225,000,000,000 . In other words , those debt service savings would buy Social Security another five years of payroll tax solvency . The larger case for debt repayment is n't based on reducing debt service costs or increasing the government 's capacity to borrow . It is that repaying debt frees investment dollars that were previously used to finance government operations so they can be dedicated to more-productive , private investment . Retiring government debt injects capital into the economy ; more capital means better tools and technology for each worker , which raises wages and increases the nation 's productivity . A more-productive economy is better able to support larger populations of retirees with a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are relatively simple-the politics , which determines whether debt is retired , how much is retired , and how the benefits of a reduced debt burden are allotted , is substantially more complicated . Roger Hickey , director of the Campaign for America 's Future , while strongly advocating repeal of the Bush tax cut , seems to acknowledge that repeal will have little direct impact on Social Security , since he does not even pretend to advocate applying the new revenue to the Social Security system . Nor would he use the new revenue to pay down the debt . Rather , he would increase government spending generally in the belief that it would lead to increased economic growth , making additional revenues available in the future . Hickey 's Social Security plan , therefore , amounts simply to a dose of old-fashioned " tax-and-spend " economics . These tax increases would not be without consequences . Interestingly , many of the people advocating repeal of the Bush tax cuts favor reducing the cap on payroll taxes , too . The combined result of the two actions would be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rates . Most economists would agree that high marginal tax rates are very likely to restrict economic output and , potentially , economic growth . Some opponents of privatization go beyond repealing the Bush tax cut and advocate other forms of general tax increases . For instance , several have suggested increasing the tax on Social Security benefits . Author and commentator Amitai Etzioni , for example , would extend income taxes to all Social Security benefits , ignoring the fact that the employee 's portion of the payroll tax has already been taxed . ( Social Security taxes are not deducted from gross income for income tax purposes . ) Less drastically , the AFL-CIO and Aaron would tax Social Security in the same way as other pension income . Going still further on the tax front , Baker calls for a tax on all stock transactions . Both the buyer and the seller of stocks would be taxed at 0.25% of the transaction price . He would also increase the capital gains tax from its current 18% to 28% , the rate prior to 1997 . To the degree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they suffer from the same problems as does repealing the Bush tax cut . However , they presumably would increase revenues after 2016 as well , which would allow revenues to be used to pay Social Security benefits . There is one final revenue-raising proposal that appears to be gaining support among some opponents of privatization . Currently , approximately 5,000,000 state , county , and municipal workers do not participate in the Social Security system . Instead , they are enrolled in their own retirement programs , which provide far-better benefits than does Social Security . The National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare would require all newly hired public employees to be brought into the Social Security system , as would Aaron . This would be a 12.4% tax hike for those workers and could potentially force them to curtail contributions to their far-more  --  lucrative private pension plans . Benefit cuts The flip side of tax hikes is benefit cuts . Most opponents of privatization have been reluctant to propose any reduction in currently promised Social Security benefits . After all , their goal is to preserve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put benefit cuts on the table . In fact , Baker suggests that they might not be such a bad thing . He points out that , because of scheduled increases in the benefits baseline , even after required cuts , retirees would actually receive checks for higher dollar amounts than they do today . Baker is not necessarily incorrect in this . Indeed , the President 's Social Security Commission makes a similar argument . It does render rather hypocritical , though , the argument of opponents that reductions in government-provided benefits included in some privatization plans are automatically bad . Indeed , many of the cuts proposed by opponents of privatization sound very much like the cuts they warn would result from it . For example , one of the most widely criticized proposals by the President 's Commission was a plan to change the indexing formula used to determine benefits . The formula is now adjusted for wage productivity ; the change would be to adjust it for prices . Benefits would remain constant on an inflation-adjusted basis , but would no longer increase at a rate greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aaron and colleagues , called this a deep cut in benefits . Yet , in 1976 , Aaron supported a very similar proposal by a Congressional commission , which included such antiprivatization stalwarts as MIT 's Peter Diamond , who said that it " would leave more options open for spending the productivity dividend of economic growth . Congress could still raise pensions in the future , but it could also decide that other programs such as housing , health insurance , or defense have greater claims on available funds . " The same holds true for other proposed cuts . Shapiro , while joining the chorus calling for repeal of the Bush tax cuts , suggests increasing the retirement age and reducing cost  --  of-living adjustments . Apfel , while not providing any specific proposals for cuts , says that " modest measures should be taken to keep Social Security benefit levels from growing as fast as the economy . " Ball suggests that the increase in benefits for future retirees , scheduled under current law , should be slowed by about three percent . He would accomplish that primarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's 35 highest years of wages to 38 years . Alicia Munnell of Boston University would lengthen the benefit computation period , as would Aaron . Lengthening the computation period means that more years of low or no wages would be included when determining the average wage on which to base benefits . Aaron probably supports the most-extensive cuts in benefits of any foe of privatization . For instance , while opponents of privatization often accuse its supporters of favoring increases in the retirement age , Aaron would raise not only the normal retirement age , but the early retirement age . He is supported in this approach by fellow Brookings scholar Gary Burtless . Myers would speed up already scheduled increases in the normal retirement age , but would leave early retirement untouched . Ghilarducci would agree to speed the increase in the normal retirement age to 67 , but only if disability criteria are loosened to include sector unemployment . Aaron would consider still further benefit cuts , including reducing or even eliminating spousal benefits . In the 2001 book he coauthored with Robert Reischauer , Countdown to Reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The simplest and least costly way to end the lesser earner problem would be to eliminate the spouse 's benefit altogether . However , this step would significantly reduce benefits for many older couples in which one spouse worked outside the home little or not at all . It would also make it far more costly for one parent to stay home to care for children . But a large majority of mothers , even those with preschool age offspring , now work , and that proportion has been rising . To aid parents who stay at home to care for youngsters , Vice Pres. Al Gore proposed , as part of his 2000 campaign for president , to give earnings credits of one half the average wage for up to five years spent caring for young children . Such a provision would further reduce the need for the spouse 's benefit . A gradual reduction in the spouse 's benefit over a decade or so from one-half of the principal earner 's benefit to one-third or even one-quarter would free-up funds that could be used to lower the projected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With the exception of Reischauer , few opponents of privatization are willing to embrace such significant benefit cuts . Government investing The third alternative identified by Clinton is to find a way to achieve a higher rate of return on movies paid into the Social Security System . In practice , this means investing Social Security funds in private capital assets . That is precisely the point made by many advocates of privatization . Yet , because opponents reject the idea of allowing workers to invest their Social Security taxes through individual accounts , they are forced to turn to a different entity for investing-namely , the government itself . Supporters of this approach seldom refer to it as government investing . Instead , they have devised an impressive collection of euphemisms for the concept . For example , Munnell calls it " broadening the portfolio " of the Social Security Trust Fund . Reimer refers to it as " diversifying the Social Security Trust Fund 's investment strategy . " To Aaron , it is " improving the management of Social Security 's reserves . " Whatever it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ central part of many reform plans supported by opponents of privatization . Ball proposed such an approach to the Social Security Advisory Council as long ago as 1996 . Clinton included it in his proposal for Social Security reform . It is at the heart of the proposal advanced by Aaron and is supported as well by the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare , New York Times columnist Paul Krugman , the Older Women 's League , Munnell , Reimer , and others . Allowing the Federal government to purchase stocks would give it the ability to obtain a significant , if not controlling , interest in virtually every major company in America . Experience has shown that even a two or three percent block of shares can give an activist shareholder substantial influence over the policies of publicly traded companies . The result could be a government bureaucrat sitting on every corporate board , a prospect that has divided advocates of government investing . Even if the government avoids directly using its equity ownership to influence corporate governance , there is likely to be an enormous temptation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the government makes . Approximately 42% of state , county , and municipal pension systems require that some portion of investment be targeted to projects designed to stimulate the local economy or create jobs . This includes investment in local infrastructure and public works projects as well as in local real estate development and in-state businesses . Moreover , 23% of the pension systems have prohibitions against investment in specific types of companies , including companies that fail to meet the " MacBride Principles " for doing business in Northern Ireland ; firms conducting business in Libya and other Arab countries ; those that are accused of pollution , unfair labor practices , or failing to meet equal opportunity guidelines ; the alcohol , tobacco , and defense industries ; and even corporations that market infant formula to Third World countries . In fairness , most advocates of government investing believe that sufficient " firewalls " can be built in to prevent government from politicizing its investment decisions . Given the dismal history of government investment policies , though , that seems to be based far more on hope than on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't know of any way that you can essentially insulate government decisionmakers from having access to what will amount to very large investments in American private industry ... I have been around long enough to realize that that is just not credible and not possible . Somewhere along the line , that breach will be broken . " Some proponents do n't even pretend to insulate the investment process from politics . For example , Gerald Shea of the AFL-CIO has suggested that it would be a good thing if the government exercised its new influence over the U.S. economy , claiming that Washington 's involvement would " have a good effect on how Corporate America operates . " This led Greenspan to warn that proposals for government investing " have very far-reaching potential dangers for a free American economy and a free American society . " International experience provides ample warning against allowing Washington to direct investment in private capital markets . A 2001 study by the World Bank found nearly universal politicization of government investment policy , resulting in rates of return well below those earned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns on government investment were below what could be earned on ordinary bank deposits . Some opponents of privatization would prefer to offer no alternative at all . They simply deny that Social Security is in need of reform . For instance , Rep. Jerrold Nadler ( D.N.Y. ) has called Social Security " a crisis that does n't exist . " Baker and Weisbrot wrote an entire book devoted to the idea that Social Security was " a phony crisis . " Their argument is , essentially , that current projections of Social Security 's insolvency are too pessimistic . They contend that , if the economy grows faster than projected , wages and payroll tax revenue will rise , providing more than enough revenue to keep the program going , without any need to make significant changes . However , as Cato Institute analyst Andrew Biggs has shown , keeping Social Security solvent would require levels of economic growth unprecedented in American history . Moreover , even if the economy does grow more quickly than projected , Social Security 's benefit liabilities and funding shortfalls will rise along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimistic than can be expected , Social Security remains insolvent . In fact , a 2001 study by a pair of demographers and economists at the University of California , Berkeley suggests that projections about Social Security 's future might not be pessimistic enough ! Ronald Lee and Ryan Edwards maintain that " the chance for a really bad outcome is far higher than commonly expected . " As a result , even most opponents of privatization admit that something must be done to reform Social Security . However , they wo n't tell us what . Beyond solvency While most opponents of privatization of fer no proposal to fix Social Security 's problems beyond solvency , it is worth noting that at least some of their plans would make those problems worse . Rate of return . Payroll taxes are already so high relative to benefits that most young workers will receive an extremely poor rate of return , one far below that provided by private capital markets . The Social Security Administration estimates that 30-year-old medium  --  wage workers will receive rates of return ranging from a high of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just 1.13% ( for a single male ) . Those returns will decline even further in the future . Raising taxes or reducing benefits , as many opponents of privatization advocate , will simply make the rate of return even worse ( at least compared with promised benefits ) . This is particularly true of proposals to increase the payroll tax . The impact on rates of return of other proposals for tax hikes is less easily measured and falls more unevenly . However , any increase in the revenue going into the system without a corresponding increase in benefits will mean lower returns . Minorities and women . The current Social Security System contains a host of inequities , many of which disadvantage minorities and women . For example , because lifetime Social Security benefits are closely linked to longevity , people with shorter life expectancies can expect to receive less in retirement benefits . At every age and income level , African-Americans have shorter life expectancies than do whites . As a result , an African-American who has the same lifetime earnings and pays the same payroll taxes as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of return . This situation is exacerbated by the facts that African-Americans are more likely to begin working earlier than whites and that African-American marriages are more likely to end in divorce in less than 10 years . Indeed , no group may be as poorly treated by Social Security as African-Americans . None of the proposals advanced by opponents of privatization would change this unfair situation-and many likely would make it worse . For example , African-Americans , who , on average , earn lower wages , would be disproportionately affected by proposed hikes in the payroll tax . Even worse would be increases in the retirement age supported by Aaron and other foes of privatization . The current system also penalizes many women , especially those who work outside the home . For instance , under Social Security 's " dual entitlement rule " for spousal benefits , the spouse with lower lifetime earnings , nearly always the wife , is eligible to receive either a benefit based on her own earnings or one-half of her spouse 's benefits , but not both . Effectively , this means that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional benefits for them . Moreover , the current spousal system may set up situations in which a two-earner couple may actually receive less in benefits than a single-earner couple with the same lifetime earnings . In addition , the loss of up to 50% of a couple 's benefits at the husband 's death throws one of every five widows into poverty , and current rules deny benefits to those who were married less than 10 years . Since the average marriage lasts just seven years , millions of women lose benefits under the current system . Some women 's organizations have proposed changes in the current system to address some of those inequities . For example , they would increase benefits for widows and decrease the number of years of marriage required to qualify for spousal benefits from 10 to seven . They would also give women a $5,000 per year credit for years spent raising children outside the workforce . These proposals would make the current system fairer , but would be costly , requiring additional revenue equal to more than one percent of payroll . Aside from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms to eliminate the current system 's inequities for females . Once again , many of their proposals would make the problems worse . Proposals to lengthen the period used to compute Social Security benefits would particularly disadvantage women , since they are far more likely than men to have years with zero or low earnings . Wealth creation . One of the strongest arguments for privatization is that a system of individual accounts would give low-income Americans an opportunity to accumulate wealth . In contrast , the current Social Security system contributes to the growing " wealth gap " in the U.S. Because it forces the poor to annuitize their savings , it prevents them from accumulating real wealth and passing that wealth on to future generations . None of the antiprivatization proposals would deal directly with the wealth creation issue , although some opponents have proposed creating individual accounts to supplement the current Social Security system as a way to help the poor accumulate wealth . These would be funded , depending on the proposal , through voluntary individual contributions , general tax revenues , or mandatory payroll tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " accounts are unlikely to benefit low-income workers . They simply do n't have enough discretionary income to be able to contribute more to their retirement savings , even if the government provides generous matching funds . On the other hand , if the add-on accounts are funded by mandatory contributions , they become simply another tax increase . If that increase is combined with the tax increases needed to keep the current system solvent , the burden on low-income workers could become intolerable . A right to benefits . Under the current Social Security System , workers have no legal right to their retirement benefits . In two important cases , Helvering v. Davis and Flemming v. Nestor , the Supreme Court has ruled that Social Security taxes are simply taxes and convey no property or contractual rights to Social Security benefits . As a result , a worker 's retirement security is entirely dependent on political decisions made by a president and Congress . Benefits may be reduced or even eliminated at any time and are not directly related to Social Security taxes paid into the system . Therefore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politicians for their retirement income . None of the proposals advanced by opponents of privatization would change this situation in any way .
