<p> WHERE have all the catchers gone ? To new teams , that 's where . <p> Of the 19 catchers who started more than 100 games last season , 8 , or 42 percent , are with new teams this year . More than 25 catchers in all have changed teams , voluntarily or involuntarily . It has been an unusually active winter for catchers . <p> The Oakland Athletics were involved with three of the catchers . They traded Ramon Hernandez , the catcher on their four consecutive playoff teams , to San Diego , then acquired Michael Barrett from Montreal and traded him to the Chicago Cubs , from whom they obtained their catcher , Damian Miller . <p> Even before the Athletics touched off that series of deals , the Minnesota Twins reluctantly sent A. J. Pierzynski to the San Francisco Giants , who decided to jettison Benito Santiago after three creditable years . <p> Kansas City , whose manager , Tony Pena , is an old catcher himself , signed Santiago and Kelly Stinnett after letting Brent Mayne leave . Mayne signed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moeller went to Milwaukee , as did Gary Bennett , who was the Padres ' primary catcher last season . <p> Baltimore 's Brook Fordyce switched to Tampa Bay , but the biggest switches came from Javy Lopez , who took his .328 batting average , 43 home runs and 109 runs batted in from Atlanta to Baltimore , and from Ivan Rodriguez , who took his World Series championship ring from Florida to 119-loss Detroit , of all places . <p> Although Rodriguez 's four-year , $40 million contract is not completely guaranteed , a baseball executive speculated that he decided to go to the Tigers because they offered the most money and this is probably going to be his last contract . <p> Money , too , was involved in the Twins ' trade of Pierzynski , who batted .312 and drove in 74 runs last season . " I was trying to free up some dollars to retain Stewart , Guardado and Hawkins , " General Manager Terry Ryan said . " Trading Pierzynski enabled us to make a run at them . " <p> The Twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie Guardado and LaTroy Hawkins . Yet they have opened the catching job for 20-year-old Joe Mauer , the No. 1 overall draft pick in 2001 . <p> " If Mauer was n't around , we would n't have done it , " Ryan said of the trade . " We 're bringing him into camp to give him the chance to claim the job . Anything that 's been asked of Mauer the past two and a half years he 's done . We think he can handle the job . " <p> The Padres initially talked to Minnesota about Pierzynski , but the Twins wanted one of San Diego 's young pitchers , whom the Padres did n't want to give up . So they went after Hernandez . " We felt our biggest need this off-season was to upgrade the catching , " General Manager Kevin Towers said . " We feel this is a significant upgrade . " <p> Towers said that he and Billy Beane , the Oakland general manager , began talking about Hernandez last June but that the Athleticswere in no position to trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kotsay for Hernandez and outfielder Terrence Long , who was another key element of the deal because the Athletics saved money by shedding his contract . <p> Hernandez is seven years younger than Miller , the Athletics ' new catcher , but Beane said the difference was n't a factor in his planning . <p> " There 's not a huge gap between catchers and their performance , " Beane said . " Other positions , there are eras where you have some dominant guys , but there 's a bunch of pretty good catchers somewhat tightly bunched together in their performance or expected performance . The career performances of these two guys are close enough . " <p> So the Athletics traded Hernandez Nov. 26 . On Dec. 15 they obtained Barrett from Montreal , which did not want to go to arbitration with him . They passed Barrett on to the Cubs the next day . Four days later , they got Miller from the Cubs . <p> Miller was signed for this year , but the Cubs did not plan to keep him beyond 2004 . They also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they will use Bako and Barrett . They also saved money on Miller 's salary and used it to help sign Todd Walker to play second base . <p> The Closer Near the Red Sox <p> If the Boston Red Sox want to talk about a need for a closer , they have to look no further than their N.F.L. neighbors . The New England Patriots will attest to the importance of a strong closer . <p> For the second time in three years , the Patriots won the Super Bowl because their closer , Adam Vinatieri , kicked a last-play field goal in regulation time , in football 's equivalent of the ninth inning . <p> The Red Sox eschewed the role of traditional closer last season , thinking they would reinvent the game . Instead they undermined their bullpen until it turned into a disaster . <p> " We got caught up in nomenclature , " Larry Lucchino , the Red Sox ' president , said . " We wanted a strong closer . " <p> But they did n't want one they had to pay millions in salary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Mariano Rivera and most others , be responsible primarily for the ninth inning . <p> " It 's not that there should n't be a strong closer type , but it 's where and when that person should be used , " Lucchino said . <p> Maybe the seventh inning is the one that 's important , Lucchino added . If the Red Sox are ahead by a run and the other team loads the bases , maybe that 's the spot where they should use their closer . <p> Their problem last season was they could not find anyone to get out of that seventh-inning jam , let alone one in the ninth . This winter , though , Boston signed Keith Foulke , who led the American League with 43 saves and 67 games finished last season . <p> Now they have to decide where they want to use Foulke : the seventh , the eighth or the ninth . In considering that decision , they would do well to remember Adam Vinatieri . <p> Pitching Experiment Debated <p> Now if you 're really looking to reinvent the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , consider a plan percolating in the mind of the Milwaukee Brewers ' general manager , Doug Melvin . He is in the early stages of a plan to have relief pitchers start some minor league games , then have starters come in beginning in the third inning . <p> " We want our starters to pitch important innings , the eighth and ninth , and not look for the bullpen , " Melvin , a former minor league pitcher , said . " We want them to know it 's their game . This is what we 're developing them for . Some guys never see the ninth inning . " <p> No premium seems to be placed any longer on a pitcher 's finishing what he starts . Teams have closers , set-up men and set-up men for the set-up men . <p> Melvin said he did n't see the disappearance of a closer under his plan , but the starter would at least have a better chance of pitching at the end of a game . <p> " Even if the relievers give up runs early , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back than if a reliever gives up runs in the eighth and ninth . " <p> A 1999 playoff game influenced Melvin 's thinking . Pedro Martinez relieved for Boston in the fourth inning , with Cleveland ahead , 8-7 , and held the Indians hitless for the final six innings in what became a 12-8 series-clinching Red Sox victory . <p> " We might consider it for one of our teams at a lower level , for the fourth or fifth starters , " Melvin said . " The minors is the place to experiment , " Melvin said . " It 's just a matter of having enough nerve to do it . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
