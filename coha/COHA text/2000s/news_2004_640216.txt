<p> For a fix-it-and-go corporate turnaround artist , Wild Oats Markets chief executive Perry Odak seems unusually concerned about the politics of salmon and coffee beans . <p> The salmon sold at Boulder-based Wild Oats comes from a farm off the coast of Ireland , so as not to further deplete wild fish populations , Odak said on a recent tour of the new store on South Kipling Parkway . <p> Likewise , some bags of coffee beans are certified organic and bear the fair-trade label that indicates growers have been paid a living wage for their crops . <p> ' This is a real commitment , ' said Odak , 58 . ' We just think as a company , we should n't be making money on the backs of poor farmers . We 're going to expand that into other areas . ' <p> Spoken like a true organics pioneer , someone who puts food safety , the environment and working conditions above profit - except that Odak , who started at Wild Oats in March 2001 , is only a recent convert . <p> His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen national companies - from Armour Food Products to Ben &; Jerry 's Homemade - out of trouble . <p> Typically , once the job is done , so is he . <p> Odak walked into a unique challenge at Wild Oats , though . <p> He needed to clean up the balance sheet of a large publicly traded company without compromising Wild Oats ' commitment to natural and organic foods . <p> Meanwhile , the company was battling for market share with Whole Foods , the nation 's largest natural foods retailer , based in Austin , Texas . <p> Until recently , Odak declined requests for interviews and steered clear of Wall Street investors while he learned the guiding principles of an industry built on ethics , not economics . <p> ' You need to walk the talk before we talk about ourselves , ' he said recently . <p> Odak took the reins of a company hung over from an acquisition binge . Wild Oats had outgrown the homespun , off-the-cuff management style of founder Mike Gilliland . <p> Wild Oats had become a national player in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt . It lacked a uniform identity . <p> There were more than 100 stores operating under 13 names . Individual managers decided which foods to stock , which meant product offerings and prices were inconsistent from store to store . Operations were disjointed . Customer service faltered , and so did sales . <p> Odak wasted no time . Two months into his tenure , he laid off 95 people , 15 of them at the corporate office . Poorly performing stores were closed . Financing was arranged to correct violations of loan agreements . <p> By spring 2002 , he had assembled a senior management team of execs from the Gap , PepsiCo , Giant Foods and Ben &; Jerry 's . The company returned to profitability . <p> The positive results were credited to a new marketing program and efficiencies customers could n't see , such as new systems for setting prices and tracking products . Food distribution was centralized , which translated to fresher produce and fewer items out of stock . <p> In September 2002 , Wild Oats raised $ 48 million in a stock sale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would help pay for eight new stores , including a new concept store on South Kipling Parkway near Ken-Caryl Ranch , where the aisles are wider and produce and cafe areas are larger . Products are organized more like a traditional grocery store , so shopping is more intuitive , Odak said . <p> This year , Wild Oats expects to repeat that style in 15 stores , including two in Colorado . Even more stores are planned for 2005 . <p> Wild Oats carried $ 124 million in short-term debt and $ 228 million in long-term debt before Odak 's arrival in 2001 . By the third quarter of 2003 , the company had knocked down short-term borrowings to $ 19,000 and total liabilities to $ 150 million . <p> Wild Oats lost some momentum last year , however , when the retailer changed distributors to cut costs . The move backfired , which cost the company profits in the third quarter and brought back the problem of items out of stock . <p> The company has since returned to its old distribution company . <p> Analysts hail Odak and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry about the grocer 's single-minded focus on core natural and organic shoppers . <p> ' What Whole Foods has done is take that concept a step further , and unfortunately , I would argue Whole Foods dominates all customers in the specialty food space , ' said analyst Carole Buyers with RBC Capital Markets in Denver . <p> Whole Foods sells natural and organic foods as well as a vast selection of conventional gourmet goods . <p> Buyers suspect Odak 's mission also has changed from prepping Wild Oats for a sale to a longer term turnaround project . <p> Kroger , a long-rumored buyer , and other large grocers are busy fighting with their unions and their biggest competitor , Wal-Mart . <p> Although Odak prepared Ben &; Jerry 's for its 2000 sale to Dutch conglomerate Unilever , he said a sale is not his goal for Wild Oats . <p> However , Odak acknowledged ' anyone that 's a publicly held company is susceptible to someone coming in . ' <p> Odak said he 'll stay as long is it takes to get Wild Oats on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five years from his start , maybe longer . <p> The fact is , Odak said he has grown more attached to Wild Oats and the natural foods industry than he has to other jobs . <p> ' Part of it is , as I 've gotten older I 've probably gotten more liberal and more understanding , ' Odak said . ' I have more empathy for those who business touches every day . It 's important to me that corporations know where their raw materials and supplies come from . ' <p> It 's fitting that Odak has immersed himself in the natural foods business . He was born into the food business , on a dairy farm in Red Hook , N.Y . <p> Odak got a degree in animal husbandry before going onto Cornell as a business management major . <p> His first job was in canned meat , working for Dial Corp . ' s Armour Food Products division in the 1970s . <p> That job sparked his passion for problem-solving . <p> ' I was one of these people that every time there was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , ' I want to work on this ' and went to it , ' he said . <p> Quick , but careful , said his advisers , including board member and serial entrepreneur Mark Retzloff . <p> ' He will readily admit he is continually learning , ' said Retzloff , a co-founder of Alfalfa 's , a Wild Oats acquisition , of Horizon Organic Dairy and most recently Aurora Organic Dairy . ' He 's willing to adapt and make the changes that are necessary when he realizes maybe there is a better direction . ' <p> Petco chief executive and Wild Oats board member Brian Devine calls Odak ' the opposite of an entrepreneur . ' <p> ' Everything the entrepreneur says , he says passionately and believes that 's the only truth , rather than looking at all of the options and then testing , ' said Devine , who joined Wild Oats ' board in 1997 . ' Perry tests a lot . ' <p> Employees greeted the changes differently . They like improved benefits , but raises now are based on performance , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adapted to the new systems , training and uniformity in products , said Edythe Mullins , a manager at the Washington Park Wild Oats store for 11 years . <p> ' You ca n't grow to 100-plus stores and have the benefits we do here and still do business the way we did when we were small , ' she said . <p> Odak prefers to keep his personal life personal , except to say he has a daughter and two stepsons , one of whom lives in Colorado . The rest of the family is on the East Coast , where Odak 's wife splits most of her time between Pennsylvania and Florida homes . <p> Odak travels back and forth . When he 's not in Colorado , he 's probably on his phone to Colorado . <p> ' When you 're the CEO , seldom are you not thinking about the company , seldom are n't you taking phone calls over the weekend or nights , ' he said . ' It 's been ingrained as part of my life . I do n't think about it anymore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with Wild Oats were worse than he thought . <p> " Not harder , more work , " Odak said . " We 're not reinventing the wheel . "
