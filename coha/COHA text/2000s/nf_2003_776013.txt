PARADISE ICE // Cape and Islands First Assistant District Attorney Michael O'Keefe told me to meet him Saturday night . He had agreed to discuss the recent murder of forty-six-year-old fashion writer Christa Worthington , who was found dead on the kitchen floor of her seaside cottage , her toddler daughter nestled by her side . O'Keefe said , " We 'll meet . We 'll talk . We 'll talk about how we keep our mouths shut . " He agreed to sit down , but first he was taking me to the Mashpee Wampanoag Winter Ball at the Sons of Italy Lodge in Cotuit . O'Keefe was running for office and had to show up at these community spectacles . It helped to have a woman along . // O'Keefe had known Chief Vernon " Silent Drum " Lopez and medicine man Earl Cash , Jr. , for a long time , but I 'd never met the Wampanoag tribe officials . I knew that in 1620 , the Pilgrims had their first encounter with Native Americans in Truro , the small town where I live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miles Standish , pilfered the savages ' stash of corn that was buried in a sand dune . It was a rustic caper , but I guess you can say it was the first B&amp;E , or " breaking and entering " violation , perpetrated on Cape Cod by white men . Today , the little crime scene is called Corn Hill . // O'Keefe apologized for making me drive all the way up Route 6 on Suicide Alley , a tight two-lane highway that bisects the peninsula , famous for its long chronicle of head-ons . A lot of travelers avoid the bottleneck and turn around . O'Keefe said he did n't know why anyone with free will would choose to live way out on the tip . // The Cape Cod peninsula is like a flexed arm thrust into the sea . Truro is at its " wrist , " and is only a mile wide at its most narrow site . The slender hook is the afterthought of the Wisconsin Stage glacier , a monstrous wall of ice ten thousand feet thick that shaped all of New England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is still carved and remastered by tides , storm surges , waves , and wind . The Cape is a river of sand ; the shoreline continually shifts and rebuilds its ridges . Backshore lagoons arise and disappear from one year to the next . The finial arm is always roaring and tingling , eroding three to six feet a year . All aspects of life this far out are evoked and controlled , atoned for or punished , by the sea . That 's what I like about it . // But the Outer Cape has a chaotic , fiddlehead topography of dunes and swales that curl around in a spiral . Standing on the breakwater at Land 's End , you can lose your sense of direction entirely . What is supposed to be due west is actually looking south , and northward could be east . A person living at the inverted tip has to let go of common sense , drop the reins and rely on intuition , especially in sea mists . // " Why do you live way out there , on that clam strip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " // " That wilderness . Why do you people go for that ? " // You people could be Truro 's movers and shakers , but more likely O'Keefe is referring to the Land 's End losers , lost souls and drifters who wash ashore and pile up down here . // " I guess it 's not for everybody , " I said . O'Keefe 's sentiments mirrored those of the Reverend James Freeman , who in 1790 wrote about Truro , " What could induce any person to remain in such a place ? " Even today , many people think that the Outer Cape is a " no man 's land , " " a god-forsaken wasteland , " or " a situation so completely removed from the stir of society , " as Emily Bront ' writes in Wuthering Heights . Even Thoreau was appalled by the Outer Cape , and wrote of Truro , " We shuddered at the thought of living there " and " The walker there must soon eat his heart . " // But for us it 's Eden . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of the selectmen 's annual report filed in 1982 , it was written , " The Board of Selectmen shall continue to make every effort to seek ways to keep Truro the Garden of Eden of Massachusetts . " But I was n't going to try to convert O'Keefe . I was getting used to his jabs. // In the summer , I like to swim in the Pamet River across from Depot Road , Christa 's street . I like it when the tide turns and the water seems to percolate with indecision-its crystal surface becomes chaotic and crosshatched-is it coming or going ? From my side of the tidal river , I had often seen young mothers with their kids . On sunny afternoons , a row of beach umbrellas blooms on the beach across the inlet . As the day advances , one by one these tilts are plucked and carried away . One of these gaudy pinwheels might have been Christa's. // Police have estimated that Worthington 's body had not been discovered for thirty-six hours . Left unattended all that time , the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The police found evidence that the toddler had tried to help . A bloodied facecloth was neatly folded across the victim 's forehead , and beside the body , they found the baby 's weighted Tippee Cup that Ava had tried to offer to her mother . // The event of a murder in our small community was never expected . There had n't been a murder in Truro for thirty years . Truro is renowned for its stunning wilderness , its remoteness , its quiet . In a recent issue of Men 's Journal , Truro was placed near the top of the list in their survey " Fifty Best Places to Live . " The article noted that one reason for its charmed status is that Truro is just about " invisible . And it means to stay that way . " No such luck , when , for instance , one summer , Air Force One helicopters swooped in to deliver Vice President Al Gore and his family at a summer retreat . And Hollywood celebrates " invisible " Truro as the ideal bucolic spot in its blockbuster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In both these films , our small town is depicted as home and haven for Tommy Lee Jones 's character , who flees violence and alien threats and returns here to become the " Truro postmaster . " As absurd as that might be , before Christa 's death was discovered on January 6 , a murder in our town would have seemed even a further stretch . // Christa Worthington , the one-time Women 's Wear Daily dynamo turned single mom , was a high-profile victim . Her killing presented instant contradictions ; it crossed boundary lines within the small insular society of Truro , which had always seemed charmed and protected , like a village in a snow globe . Incongruent hitches emerged in a hodgepodge . Christa 's chic CV , her Yankee credentials , and patrician lifestyle had become enmeshed with the Outer Cape 's blue-collar mystique of mariner traditions , rogue sailors , lady-killers , and one local legend in particular . // Secrets , sex , and money . // The principals at the core of the murder were an offbeat triangle . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a quiet , sometimes stormy children 's book author ; and the woman who had entranced them both , Christa Worthington , a fashion writer . Praised by her editors , one of whom had called her a " fashion anthropologist , " Christa left the fashion world and had holed up in Truro with her out-of-wedlock " miracle baby . " // In addition to Jackett and Arnold , the murder had an unusual cornucopia of possible suspects . " Suspect is a TV word , " O'Keefe griped , but the list of people " in the orbit of opportunity " was a ragtag patchwork of the American quilt . // The list included the philanderer 's jilted wife , Susan , who remained " the undisputed most beautiful girl to ever graduate from Provincetown High School " ; Jackett 's edgy , Rapunzel-look-alike daughter , Braunwyn ; the estranged husband of the edgy daughter , Keith Amato ; Jackett 's handsome and monastic sons , Luc and Kyle ; and Christa 's own father , Christopher " Toppy " Worthington , a retired Boston lawyer . Toppy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a heroin habit , was also under investigation . A contrapuntal rumor soon began to circulate that Porter was n't just a shack job but that she was Toppy 's love child from an extramarital affair he had had when Christa was growing up . // That 's quite a piebald gymkhana and I needed O'Keefe to help me sort through it . // O'Keefe is usually deadpan , with a wicked gleam that surfaces now and then . His stony face , dark hair , and compact physique is an attractive amalgam of two schools : the film noir detective and the all-too-familiar mainstream-TV Kojak . His locution is acerbic , clipped . He speaks in monosyllabic crits of whatever falls in front of him . Serious to a fault , his veneer is hard to break through , highly polished , and he does n't volunteer much . But his introspections sizzle beneath the surface . It 's my goal to soften him up . It 's going to be tough to penetrate the steely prosecutor coupled with the savvy politician in him . // O'Keefe had told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cape for the last eighteen years . Unattended deaths-you have to figure out if it 's suicide , accident , or murder . Like that boy killed last week in West Yarmouth-that was a violent crime . That kid lost twelve pints of his fourteen pints of blood . " // " Twelve pints ? " // " There 's a lot of blood in you , " he said . // That 's almost a river . I imagined him rolling up his trouser cuffs . // " I 've got a mortician 's sense of humor by now , " he said . // I wanted to learn how O'Keefe nosed around " murder world " without it seeping into him . It was taking its toll on me . I see Christa everywhere . If there 's a woman with a little curly-topped girl in the A&amp;P , at the ATM at Seamen 's Bank , or a woman waving her Mobil speed pass , her back to me , filling her tank at the next pump . She might have Christa 's high forehead , pouty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's a nobody . // The night of the Wampanoag Ball , I had volunteered to tag up with O'Keefe at the commuter lot at Exit 6 on the Mid-Cape Highway . I thought that it was a convenient spot to leave one of our cars . But he told me to go straight to his office in Barnstable . He 'd meet me . He explained that his office was in the big white colonial a couple of doors east of the county courthouse , across from the Dolphin Restaurant and the demure little Barnstable post office . I took my first baby steps just up the street at 6A , and I thought I knew by heart the seventeenth-century picture-book village : the courthouse ; the Barnstable Tavern ; the Dolphin Restaurant ; the Cancer Ransack Shop ; shake-roofed cottages and Victorian guesthouses ; the block-to-block antique emporiums ; and , at one time , there was an aviary that sold budgies and society finches . But I had never been inside the DA 's office . // I arrived after sunset to find the building was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left my car to walk around the footprint , in case there was an entrance on the other side and maybe O'Keefe expected me to find him . The mountain was n't going to come to me . As I toured outside the building , I saw the Barnstable County House of Corrections perched just up the hill . Originally built to house seventy-five inmates , it now kennels three hundred . The complex was blazing ; a modest little compound with an afterthought of concertina wire that twinkled in the floodlights. // As I circled the white colonial that fronted Main Street , I sidestepped a little mess on the sidewalk , a broken jar of jelly . I stared at the sugary tumble of shattered glass and strawberries . It must have jimmied from a shopping bag and exploded right here . Its blood-red pectin stained a deep scallop on the fresh-swept paving stone . Roadside stands all over Cape Cod sell these homemade jellies , watermelon pickle , and corn relish , but none of these kiosks would be in operation yet . It was early March and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a label . I stooped and poked the weeping blob with a fingertip . I tasted it . Sweet with a sharp aftertaste. // The little treasure upset me . One time I had left a little jam pot in smithereens in a hotel room in Manhattan . Room service had brought croissants and coffee , and I pitched the mini-jar at my visitor 's head as he had skulked out the door . // A car purred into the side lot and squeezed beside my Camry . I walked over to the passenger door . Instead of inviting me to sit down beside him , O'Keefe climbed out of the car . His door swung wide open to deliver a powerful blow of astringent cologne . As the car light flicked on , I saw the spray container propped on the console : " Eternity-for Men . " I wondered if he brought his aftershave bottle everywhere he went . // O'Keefe was groomed and suited up in an elegant pinstripe . He was wearing the midnight-black camel hair overcoat I 'd admired the first time I met him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to wear trousers because I had recently broken my ankle and it was still swollen . My vanity wounded , I sacrificed my pride and wore a little basic black number and a pair of flats . I was just out of a cast and could n't wear heels . Embarrassed by the infirmity , I explained to O'Keefe that I felt " uneven , " kicking one toe out and then the other to show him my lopsided conformation . I might as well admit the deficit and douse any expectations for perfection . He examined the damage and said , " Well , at least you 're standing up . " // We were just breaking the ice , but the exchange reminded me of James M. Cain 's critique about a woman 's " legworks " in the first pages of his noir mystery novel Serenade . Something about O'Keefe had reminded me of Cain 's obsessive reverence for women even as he dismissed them , like a man who fears his addiction might be revealed if he does n't publicly decry it . // I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . O'Keefe did n't have an extra minute to waste . His law enforcement schedule was dawn to the wee hours , and he was always charging through his tasks full speed . From his morning coffee , he hopped from his offices with DA Phillip Rollins to the courthouse , to the state police barracks , to CPAC meetings for crime prevention and control , to taped-off chambers-of-horror murder scenes , to community soirees with teapots and trays of petits fours . He is a public man . He told me that he 'd been up to the state crime lab in Sudbury , " twisting their arms and holding hands " to get them to complete DNA testing for the Worthington case . In the Sudbury lab , DNA capabilities are so limited that each of the state 's district attorneys can submit only one case a month , first come , first serve . " They do n't have the bodies , " O'Keefe said . // " The bodies ? Where do they take the bodies ? " // He looked at me as if I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have the resources . This is Massachusetts . We do n't , we do not invest in the law enforcement infrastructure . We ran out of state police overtime money February ninth . Done . //
