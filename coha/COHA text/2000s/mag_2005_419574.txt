One of my favorite calibers is one you might not have heard of  --  the .225 Winchester . It 's fast , it 's accurate and it does the job it was designed to do to near perfection . It 's also one of the most colossal failures in modern cartridge making . Explaining why some calibers fail while others succeed is a lot like trying to explain why some marriages go sour while others blossom . They all start out with the promise of enduring bliss , but sooner or later-much sooner in the case of the .225 Win. - some of them meet their demise . Of course , most calibers that we consider obsolete simply died of old age . The real puzzlers are the modern-day hotshots that seemed bound for success only to stumble at the starting gate . The easiest one to pick on is the aforementioned .225 Win . In almost every aspect of its design and presentation the folks at Winchester demonstrated a death wish unprecedented in cartridge marketing . Which is all the sadder because I , for one , believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything else about the misbegotten .225 was in the wrong place  --  especially the rifle . To be charitable , it might be that they were still wistful about their rimmed .219 Zipper ( another failure ) , or simply saw success in a round similar to the .219 Wasp , a rimmed wildcat popular at the time . Since its introduction in 1936 , Winchester 's bolt-action Model 70 rifle had been a darling of hunters and richly deserved its motto , " the rifleman 's rifle . " But by the early 1960s things were not going well at Winchester . Newly arrived MBA-type managers were focusing on ways to reduce production costs , and their hard glare fell on the M70 and other costly models like the M12 shotgun . Beginning in the 1950s the making of M70s had been slightly economized by replacing metal buttplates with plastic ones while using plainer wood and less checkering . But such cuts did n't go far enough to suit the bean counters , and in 1964 a whole new M70 was introduced ... to the horror of riflemen . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well known , along with how the phrase " Pre-64 " entered our lexicon , so I wo n't tell it again . Except to point out that the .225 chambering made its grand entrance at the time of Winchester 's 1964 debacle . Some night when we 're sitting around a campfire we might modestly amuse ourselves by speculating on whether the .225 might have been salvaged had it been a truly spectacular cartridge . But the facts are that it was n't , and that it was born with a couple of strikes already against it . For one thing-now tell me if this makes sense-Winchester was abandoning a varmint cartridge better than the .225 : the .220 Swift . True , there had been problems with the Swift ( along with years of bad publicity from writers who had probably never shot it ) - enough to cause Winchester 's executives to vow they 'd never make another one . ( They would recant that vow a few years later . ) One problem with the Swift , though minor , was a rim that extended somewhat beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cartridges are at odds with many bolt-action rifles-the M70 included-and cause occasional feeding problems . It seems clear enough that when you design a new cartridge it makes sense to eliminate problems , such as rims , that existed before . But did Winchester ? Take a guess . To be fair , however , I have to say that I 've owned two of those beastly looking 1964 rifles in .225 caliber , and with factory ammo they were , until recently , the most accurate factory rifle/ammo combos I 've ever shot . With so many things going against it , the .225 was a cartridge that needed to be put out of its misery , and the coup de grace was administered by Remington 's .22/250 . Announced just weeks after the introduction of the .225 , the .22/250 had been an immensely popular wildcat ( made by necking a .250 Savage case down to .22 caliber , hence its name ) and had benefitted from decades of favorable word of mouth and publicity . So while the .225 stumbled at the starting gate , the .22/250 hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's popular M700 and other brands that were quick to add it to their catalogs . Where are they now ? It 's easy to play coroner and declare the cause of the .225 's death . But with other cartridges that suffered a similar fate , the causes tend to be more subtle . Remember the .307 and .356 Winchester rounds ? When they appeared on the scene back in the early 1980s , the stars were aligned in their favor . Or so it seemed , because the cartridges and rifles for which they were chambered represented two popular worlds . The .308 Win . cartridge was riding a crest of popularity about then and the .358 Win . had earned a solid reputation as good medicine in brush country . So would n't they be great if combined with the light , fast-handling , lever-action carbines so beloved by American hunters ? As a matter of fact , Savage had done exactly that several years earlier with its M99 lever rifle , but by 1980 had sidelined M99 production . At any rate , the M99 had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so a .308/.358-M94 union seemed to be a marriage made in ballistic heaven . But first there were a few problems to be solved . The .308 and .358 were modern , high-intensity rounds that developed more internal pressure than the old M94 was designed to withstand . Winchester countered this problem with a bulked-up M94 called the XTR that also featured a redesigned ejector , which tossed fired cases out at an angle so they would n't bang against top-mounted scopes as happened with the older top-ejection M94 's . These improvements were well and good and would have been a fine place to stop , but since the folks at Winchester were in a redesigning mood they also added a bulky Monte Carlo stock that looked as out of place on the 94 as a tango dancer at a hoedown . Along the way , the ammo-developing arm of Winchester figured that rimmed versions of the .308 and .358 would go well with the revamped 94 and came out with the .307 and .356 Win . rounds . Except for the rims , dimensions are virtually identical to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are a bit reduced , especially the downrange figures of the .307 , owing to its flat-tipped bullets ( a precaution against accidental ignitions that might occur when pointed bullets are loaded in tubular magazines ) . Inevitably , the .307 and .356 were compared to the .308 and .358 and came up short . That might have been forgiven if the rifle had more appeal , but it too suffered when compared to M94s of generations past . So after struggling with the cartridges for about 15 years , Winchester threw in the towel . Nowadays Winchester ammo has reduced its loadings to one each for the .307 ( 180-grain ) and .356 ( 200-grain ) and , according to the Blue Book of Gun Values , rifles in these calibers have a collectors ' value of some 25 percent above that of M94s of that generation , indicating that very few were sold . REMINGTON 'S BIG 8 One cartridge that I think deserved a lot more popularity is the 8mm Remington Magnum . But it 's pretty obvious why it did n't succeed when you compare its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's .300 and .338 magnums . Shortly after Remington gave the word in 1978 that the 8mm Mag . would be available in its M700 bolt rifle , I took one on a few hunts . I pulled off some satisfying long shots at elk and moose with 220-grain bullets factory-loaded to a reported 2,830 feet per second . But whereas the 8mm Mag . case was as long as the full-length .375 H &H,; and thus required a magnum-length action and corresponding longer bolt travel , the .300 and .338 Winchesters offered quite similar ballistics in standard-length ( .30/06 ) cases and rifles . Today Remington loads only a 200-grain bullet at 3,000 fps , compared to a current 200-grain Super-X .338 Win . Mag . bullet at 2,960 fps . So despite the 8mm Mag . ' s larger case capacity , it did n't offer enough of a performance advantage to make it a winner . But now the plot thickens with Winchester having just introduced an 8mm Mag . of its own : the .325 WSM . This puts it head to head with the .338 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple more calibers that were hobbled at the starting gate were the 6.5 Rem . Mag . and .284 Winchester . The essence of a slender 6.5 bullet in a Magnum case is velocity , a flat trajectory and the appeal of long-range shooting . Remington , however , was thinking in terms of short-range timber hunting and offered its 6.5 Mag . in the stubby little M600 carbine . I wish I had one because these rifles are now rare and valuable collectors ' items . WINCHESTER 'S .284 Although the .284 Winchester could have achieved greatness ( yes , it 's that good ) , it has instead been a perennial bridesmaid . Winchester 's concept was a good one-packing performance nearing that of the .270 Win . and .280 Rem . into a case scarcely longer than the .308 Win . To achieve such a wonder it designed from scratch a case somewhat fatter than the .308 , with more powder capacity . If this short-but-potent round had been united with light , short-action bolt rifles , it might very well have made firearms history . Instead it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accurate M88 lever and M100 autoloading rifles . When the rifles disappeared , the .284 did too , but not before a host of wildcatters discovered that the plump case was great for converting into such popular wildcats as the 6mm/284 and 6.5/284 . For some good cartridges that deserve better , there is life after death . FOOD FOR THOUGHT At the beginning of this piece I mentioned that the tragic .225 Winchester is one of my favorites . But why ? Rimmed cartridges such as the .225 belong in single-shot , falling-block-type rifles . So recently when I had master craftsman Pete Grisel build a rifle on a beautiful little Miller single-shot action , the .225 was a logical caliber . Which makes it interesting to speculate : Could the .225 have survived and possibly even flourished if it had been offered in a popular single-shot rifle such as the Ruger Number One ? But oh , how often we all overlook the obvious . A watch list of endangered and threatened cartridges : RIFLE .218 Bee .222 Rem .

Just JIM Marvelous Creations Recently I happened across a TV program that had a panel of assorted know-it-alls discussing mankind 's greatest achievements . I went along with their ranking the ancient Roman aqueducts with the great bridges of today , and had no quarrel with them equating the cave paintings of ancient man with Michelangelo 's Sistine Chapel . But to my acute annoyance the program ended without their once mentioning what I consider one of mankind 's most exquisite achievements  --  the bird dog . Nowhere does the genius of man glitter more brilliantly than when he recognizes the genius of another species and harnesses it for the betterment of both himself and that species @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grander because it is the result of many generations of humanity sharing a dream no less inspired than those of the greatest artists and bridge builders . Even as we marvel at ourselves for piercing the heavens , spanning great waters and developing worldwide communications , what other invention can we lay claim to that finds a quail with breathtaking precision , brings it to our hand , faithfully trusts and adores us in spite of what we are , and asks in return only for a scratch on its ear , a murmured " well done , old boy , " and the pleasure of our company ? This is why I 'd rather spend my days with the marvelous creations called bird dogs than with artists or bridge builders . Illustration <p>                     @x My story begins at the extreme edge of memory , on a snowy January afternoon when I was six years old , and it seemed as if all the bells in all the churches of St. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father lifted me up so I could see over the top of the balcony railing , and I felt the freezing wind on my face and saw , through the greenish-yellow fog , a crowd of people such as I had never seen before . <p> The mass of people , all singing and shouting and waving flags and banners , seemed to stretch as far as I could see , all across the Palace Square and beyond , out toward the corners of the avenues and even along the bridge across the river . <p> " Batiushka ! Batiushka ! " they were shouting . " Little Father ! " Though the noise of their shouting seemed to dissolve into the resonant clanging of the bells and the singing of " God Save the Tsar . " <p> It was my name day , or near it , the Feast of the Holy Martyr Tatiana of Rome who lived in the time of the Caesars , and at first I thought they were all shouting and singing to celebrate my name day feast , so I waved and smiled and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such joy at my feast day . <p> But of course it was not my name day that they were celebrating , it was something much more important , as I found out later . <p> My father put me down but I could still see through the open stonework of the balustrade and I could still hear the tremendous commotion . People began singing " Holy Russia " and chanting " Hail to the Russian army and fleet " and clapping as they chanted , though their poor hands must have been raw from the cold . Mother led us back through the glass doors into the White Hall and we thawed ourselves in front of the fire . <p> She smiled at us and gave us hot milk and plates of warm buns with honey and icing . We were all happy that day because she had just told us a wonderful secret : that we would soon have a baby brother . <p> There were four of us girls in the family , in that winter of l904 . I was six , as I have already said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was four and the baby , Anastasia , was two and a half . Everybody said we needed a brother and mama assured us that we would soon have one , no matter what stories our Grandma Minnie told . ( Grandma Minnie was unkind to mama , and always said she could only have girls . ) <p> " Is it because our little brother is coming that all the people are shouting and all the bells are ringing ? " I asked . <p> " No , Tania . It is because they love Russia and they love us , especially your dear papa . " <p> " I heard Chemodurov say it was because of the war , " Olga said , in her most grown-up , know-it-all voice . Chemodurov was my father 's valet and the source of all Olga 's information at that time . <p> " Hush ! We leave such things to your father . " Mama spoke crisply , and gave Olga a look that made her frown and sulk , though she did obey and said nothing more . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , changing the subject . " Did you manage to avoid stepping on Olga 's feet ? " <p> " Professor Leitfelter says I am a good dancer , " I said proudly . " I keep good time with my feet . " <p> Olga and I went to dancing class twice a week at the Vorontzov Institute for Young Noblewomen . With forty other girls , all of us dressed in identical long white pinafores and pink linen underskirts , we stepped and twirled , promenaded and bowed to the music of a grand piano , while our dancing master walked up and down , correcting our form and clapping his hands irritably when we failed to keep in step . <p> I loved dancing class . Everything about it pleased me , from the beautiful high-ceilinged immaculately white ballroom in which it was held , with its grand marble columns and its immense chandeliers , to the gold-framed portraits that looked down on us from the walls while we danced , to the grace of the best dancers and the carefree feeling the movements brought out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer a grand duchess , fussed over by nursemaids and servants . I was just one of forty identical girls , treated no differently from the others just because I was the emperor 's daughter . ( Professor Leitfelter was equally strict with us all . ) For as long as the class lasted I yielded , happily , to the flow of the music and drifted away . <p> On the following day the immense crowds formed again in Palace Square and out beyond it . Once again the church bells rang and the people sang and shouted , and my father led us all out onto the balcony to receive their tribute . <p> " I 've never seen anything like it , " my father said to us all at tea that afternoon . " Such huge demonstrations of support , such outpourings of love and affection for the nation  --  " <p> " And the dynasty . Do n't forget that , " my mother interrupted . " It is for the house of Romanov , and for you , Nicky . " <p> My father smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the emperor , was the focus of veneration . <p> " My people are loyal , " he said . " They may complain , they may go on strike and march in protest and even throw bombs , but when the nation needs them , they respond . I 'm told there are crowds like this in ever town , " he went on . " Men are rushing to volunteer for army service . Contributions are pouring in , tens of thousands of rubles . And all because we are at war with Japan . " <p> " We will win , wo n't we , papa ? " I asked . <p> " Of course , Tania . Only the British have a finer navy than we do . Though Cousin Willy has many fine ships as well . " Mama 's cousin Willy was Kaiser Wilhelm , ruler of Germany . I had seen pictures of him in mama 's study , a burly , angry-looking man . Mama did n't like him . <p> For many days the crowds came to cheer and sing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wave . But papa , who always looked a little sad except when he was taking a long walk or riding his bicycle or chopping wood , began to look very sad , and before long the noise and the singing stopped , though there were still many people in Palace Square , looking up toward the balcony or talking among themselves . <p> Olga told me that some of our big Russian ships had been sunk by the Japanese . A lot of men had drowned , she said , and I thought , no wonder papa looks sad . <p> " There is a war . A terrible war . And we are losing . Chemodurov says so . " <p> I remember being confused , and being sorry to see my father 's sad face ( for he could be very jolly ) , and the next thing I remember was the day my baby brother was born . <p> On that day , in the morning , we children were sent upstairs to the nursery , out of the way , and were told that mama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her bed . <p> " All the tsars of Russia have been born in that bed , " our nursemaid told us . " Your father , and your grandfather , who was strong as an ox , and your sainted great-grandfather , the one who was blown all to pieces by that awful man . " <p> It was not long before the guns in the Peter and Paul Fortress began going off and we knew that our little brother had come into the world . We were allowed to go downstairs to see mama and the little baby . Mama was lying back on the soft pillows of the bed and looking very tired , the way she looked when her head hurt . Yet she looked beautiful , with her lovely face softened by fatigue and her rich dark blond hair spread out all over the lace-trimmed pillow . She smiled at us and held out her hands . <p> Beside the bed a golden cradle flamed in the sunlight . Next to the cradle sat one of the nursery maids , gently rocking it with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing there , beneath a purple velvet coverlet embroidered in gold , our new brother , asleep . <p> " Alexei , " mama said quietly . " We are going to call him Alexei . The eighth Romanov to sit on the throne of all the Russias . Now , that is something to celebrate .
