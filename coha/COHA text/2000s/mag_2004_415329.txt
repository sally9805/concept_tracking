As a nasty Aussie financial scandal picks up steam , it is sucking in Berkshire Hathaway , Goldman Sachs and a stock tout for the New York mob . <p> Rodney Adler is the kind of guy a friend labeled a " spoilt brat . " He was born into wealth in Sydney , Australia . In 1988 , at age 29 , he inherited a 30% stake , worth about $300 million , in commercial insurer FAI Ltd. when his father died suddenly . As FAI 's chief executive over the next decade , Adler struggled to keep the firm afloat while its stock sank . The American Depositary Receipts fell from a peak of $73 to $5 . He bailed out in 1998 , selling FAI to HIH Insurance Ltd. , another Australian insurer , for $180 million . Three years later HIH declared bankruptcy with $3.2 billion in debts , ranking as one of the largest failures in Australian history . ( Figures have been translated from Australian into U.S. dollars . ) <p> Turns out that Adler pulled off the sale with help from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policies was Ajit Jain , who runs Berkshire Hathaway 's National Indemnity reinsurance arm and has been described by Warren Buffett as the " guiding genius " of the firm 's major-catastrophe line . <p> Investment bank Goldman Sachs , it also turns out , had looked hard at buying into FAI , only to turn up its nose . Then it emerged as the financial adviser in its sale . The firm has faced questioning by the Australian government for knowing about FAI 's financial artifices but saying nothing . <p> To top it off , Adler was all the while scheming to pump up the stock of FAI  --  whose assets included the troubled Hotel St. Moritz on Central Park South  --  by hyping its U.S.-listed ADRs . His partner was a stock tout who , it later turned out , was working for the New York mob . <p> Australia set up a Royal Commission , akin to a congressional investigative committee , last year to look into the scandal . It has uncovered evidence that Berkshire 's Jain worked out a contract " designed to enable FAI @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year it was up for sale , according to Geoffrey Bromley , executive vice president for Guy Carpenter &; Co. , the Marsh &; McLennan subsidiary that acted as middleman for the reinsurance . At no time was Adler interested in insuring against risk , Bromley conceded in testimony to the panel . <p> Instead , Jain negotiated to " develop a structure that would pass muster " with regulators , Bromley said . It included at least the appearance that FAI was transferring risk to National Indemnity . Then , when National Indemnity paid a large " claims recovery " back to FAI in the first year of the deal , the policy 's status as reinsurance enabled FAI to book the money as a profit . When the deal was done , the parties backdated a cover note almost one year , possibly to give the appearance of a forward-looking policy . A commission attorney has labeled the Berkshire policy a " sham . " <p> FAI 's final chapter began on Christmas Eve in 1997 , as Malcolm Turnbull , then head of Goldman Sachs ' Australian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equity arm wanted to expand in Australia and figured it might do well taking FAI private , whipping it into shape and selling out . Adler was keenly interested . Over the previous three years FAI had lost a cumulative $38 million on $2.6 billion in revenues . The prospect of a big payday apparently convinced Adler to take extreme measures to pretty up FAI . In May 1998 he hosted New Yorker Jeffrey Pokross and his wife in Sydney , wining and dining them at swank nightspots . <p> Back home Pokross ran DMN Capital and worked with Bobby Lino , a.k.a . Robert L. Little , a member of New York 's Bonanno crime family . Pokross had been charged with a " pump-and-dump " stock-ramping scheme the previous January by the National Association of Securities Dealers . He returned from the Sydney trip promising to " support the FAI stock . " <p> In mid-June 1998 FAI 's fiscal year was winding down and Adler faced a loss of as much as $30 million on $600 million in revenues . One week before his book closing he began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insurer is supposed to assume another 's risk . FAI 's policies were from National Indemnity , a unit of Omaha-based Berkshire Hathaway , and GeneralCologne Re , which Berkshire bought in late 1998 . National Indemnity sold FAI a policy costing $33 million over five years . FAI had to pay only $3.3 million in fiscal 1998 but received $24 million in an unusual claims recovery that , as a reinsurance buyer , it could book as profit . The real bill would come due over the next four years via $7.4 million annual premiums . The coverage ostensibly had to do with earthquake damage in Sydney . There were no earthquakes , but the claims-recovery gambit made for the quick payback . <p> Meanwhile , FAI promised to pay GeneralCologne Re $55 million for $52 million in coverage . Geoffrey Barnum , general manager for GeneralCologne in Australia , was asked by a commission attorney if he could " think of any benefit that FAI might have derived from the transaction , except a perceived advantage to its reported results , if it accounted for the contract as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think of any other advantage , no . " Testifying under oath , Barnum admitted the apparent transfer of risk that qualified the policy as reinsurance in the contract was actually overridden in separate private documents . If they had been disclosed , the policies would not have been approved by regulators , he said . <p> Together the policies enabled Adler to turn his looming loss of as much as $30 million in fiscal 1998 into a $5.2 million pretax profit . Berkshire Hathaway says the terms were proposed by the Marsh &; McLennan broker and that it required FAI to disclose them to external auditors and regulators . It denies acting to conceal the true nature of the policies . <p> Around that time , Goldman sent bankers to FAI , which accorded them office space and nonpublic data . Turnbull held a climactic meeting at FAI in mid-August 1998 , coming away sure he did n't want to embark on a turnaround effort at the troubled company . An internal Goldman memo pegged FAI 's " true " net assets  --  after the cost of paying off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loan portfolio and a coal company , plus goodwill  --  at a mere $12 million . That was a fraction of FAI 's $132 million reported book value . <p> " This memo brought Goldman 's proposal to a halt , " Norman O'Bryan , a lawyer for the Royal Commission , told the panel . <p> Fortunately for Adler , and Goldman , Raymond Williams popped up within days with a generous bid . Williams had set up HIHin Sydney in 1968 . He priced policies to get business and had used acquisitions to build a $1 billion ( revenues ) global firm by the time he went after FAI . <p> HIH offered $180 million for FAI in mid-September , a 43% premium to its market cap . If Williams wanted to buy FAI he would have to do so without meticulous research into FAI 's books , Adler decreed . Williams agreed , relying initially on a valuation by the SG Hambros Group and FAI 's accounts , audited by HIH 's own accountants  --  Arthur Andersen . <p> To recoup Goldman 's costs , Turnbull pitched Adler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ FAI . Adler agreed on Sept. 24 , one day after unloading half his family 's holdings , to HIH in a private transaction . <p> The ink was not dry on the merger papers when HIH 's fortunes began to sink . FAI still owed large reinsurance payments and lost $70 million in fiscal 1999 on U.S. liability insurance . Within 18 months HIH wrote down the FAI asset by $240 million  --  the liabilities , that is , made FAI worse than worthless . HIH was also hit hard by its own losses . Still , for the first half of 2000 HIH posted an $11 million profit and $563 million in net assets . It declared bankruptcy five months later . Of HIH 's $3.2 billion hole , FAI 's share may turn out to be as much as $600 million  --  " probably a substantial cause of the collapse , " said panel lawyer O'Bryan . <p> The collapse deprived half of Australia 's doctors of malpractice insurance and prompted a national strike . Thousands of small businesses lost liability coverage . FAI still exists as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of HIH 's liquidation . <p> Adler was sued by Australian securities authorities for helping HIH artificially inflate its stock price after it bought FAI , when he was a director and shareholder of the acquirer . An Australian civil court banned him from serving as a corporate director for 20 years and fined him $3 million . Adler has appealed the ruling . <p> HIH 's Williams has yet to testify and declines comment . His attorney calls him " devastated " by HIH 's bust . <p> By the time he visited Adler in Sydney , stock tout Pokross had rolled over for the FBI and reported back to the feds on his trip , even though Adler was n't under investigation by the Americans . According to an e-mail he sent to the FBI in 1998 , Adler 's invitation to Sydney was an attempt " to drive up the price of FAI in Australia to attract a higher takeover bid . " Adler said in commission testimony he was unaware of Pokross ' mob links and met him while looking for a small-cap broker . <p> Pokross @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of five New York crime families for using union funds to ramp small-cap stocks much like FAI . He is in hiding under witness protection and was never punished for his alleged securities violations . <p> Goldman Sachs says it did nothing wrong in not disclosing how the Berkshire policies had goosed FAI earnings . " It would have been improper to give confidential information to HIH , for whom we were not working , " says Goldman Managing Director Lucas van Praag . " The whole issue here is caveat emptor . " Turnbull says it 's common to seek other ways to engage a spurned investment target . He adds : " I am being set up by people out to disparage Goldman Sachs and me . " <p> The disparaging may just be getting going . When the Royal Commission finishes , HIH creditors will likely join the act . Chief liquidator Anthony McGrath of KPMG vows a good show . " The information is all there and it 's just a matter of time , " he says . " These are highly expensive pieces of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a return .
