The Other Woman A Novel of Suspense By Diamond , Diana St. Martin 's Press Diamond , Diana Pam Leighton should have seen it coming . She knew when John Duke was named a candidate for a position in the administration he would have to tidy up all the messy corners of his life . She was one of those messy corners . It was n't that she was nave . Pam was a reasonably bright college graduate with an advanced degree in economics who held down a responsible research post for a Washington trade association . She knew that married men who wandered from home were usually on short leashes . Deep down she understood that John Duke would never leave his wife , Catherine , no matter how sincerely he claimed that they were no longer in love . Love meant different things to men at different stages of their lives . Maybe his romantic feelings for her were stronger than his feelings for Catherine , but that did n't mean he wanted to leave his wife . Pam had always understood that if push came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was just that , it was hard to believe . Hard , because her two-year affair with her boss was n't the typical affair . Pam was n't a kept woman . She earned her money and paid her own rent . The only thing she depended on John Duke for was affection . Their relationship was n't centered on the bedroom , even though it might have been . Pam was a very sexy woman , on the cusp of thirty , when youthfulattractiveness softens into mature interests . Her coloring -- -dark hair with blue eyes -- -looked like it was the result of the mating of an English stallion and an Italian mare somewhere back in her bloodlines . Her skin tone , high cheekbones , and full lips came from her Mediterranean heritage . Her straight nose and sharply cut jawline were inherited from Nordic raiders . Her figure was a bit too curvaceous for a runway model but without the bounce that draws applause from construction workers . There was just enough flow in her movements to turn heads on the street , and to raise faces over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sex toy . She had no drawer of transparent nightwear , nor were there leather outfits hanging in her closet . She slept in pajamas , or in nothing at all , depending on the occasion . Her bathrobe was terry cloth , her underwear white cotton , and her bras unpadded . When John came to her apartment , she was as apt to smell of a lemon fish marinade as of an exotic Parisian fragrance . In their typical evening together , they worked side by side in the kitchen , generally sipping the wine intended for the saucepan . They shared a lively conversation over dinner and often fell asleep in front of the television . On weekends , when he was in town , they sat around in pajamas passing sections of The Washington Post back and forth before they settled down to the crossword puzzle . Some evenings , they worked together . The Electric Energy Institute 's real business was lobbying government officials to make sure that no legislation hostile to the electric utilities , or regulation distasteful to their executives , would ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politically attractive conclusions her research should yield . John would sometimes ask her advice on a recalcitrant senator . How big a donation was he looking for ? How many votes could he deliver ? What they shared was n't that much different from any marriage between urban professionals . Much more than just casual sex , their affair was a commitment of time , interest , and affection , from which intimacy flowed naturally and guiltlessly . It truly seemed that it would last forever . They had to be discreet , of course . In the Electric Energy Institute offices , they exchanged greetings in passing that held no hint of affection . " Good morning , Pam ! " " Good morning , John , " when they met in the lobby . " I 'll have those figures you asked for this afternoon " and " Thank you , Pam , " when they interacted in the office . If they found themselves at the same table in the cafeteria , they invited others to join them . They never booked luncheon reservations at the same restaurant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never at a fashionable downtown restaurant or at one of the Georgetown clubs . As director of the institute , John was immediately recognizable by most senators , congressmen , and their staffers , as well as power industry executives . As the institute 's top researcher , Pam would be recognized by most second-level Washington officials and many of the executives of the institute 's sponsoring companies . Both of them were well known to the lobbying industry , with its offices stretching for block after block along K Street . Within hours after their appearing together in the District , it would have been universally acknowledged that they were an item . Instead , they would often travel north to Baltimore , where they could get lost in the crowds at the harbor . They could drive west to Leesburg , where the county was exploding so rapidly that no one knew anyone . Or they might head south to Charlottesville and join the chaos of student revelers . When business called for them to travel together , they would find separate rooms in the hotel , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Pam was joining John in a major resort city , they would book separate flights on different airlines . The subterfuge bothered neither of them . It was accepted as a necessary arrangement in their relationship , just as a husband might put up with a two-hour daily commute . Over the two years of their relationship , there had been several close calls . One time , at a resort in the Bahamas , John had excused himself from the dinner table only to run into the president of a sponsoring company in the lobby . While the two men shared a drink at the bar , Pam had slipped away , leaving two untouched dinners behind . They had checked out in the middle of the night . On another occasion , Pam had seen a man from their office at an airport gate where John 's flight was arriving . Suggestively , she had led him off for a cocktail . For weeks after , her colleague had hinted around the watercooler that she was hitting on him . Only once had Pam and John been caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater and saw a congressman they both knew staring back at them . Fortunately , the woman with the congressman was from an escort service , and both couples silently agreed not to acknowledge one another . Pam had been delighted when John told her that his name was in play for a position in the new president 's cabinet . He had modestly dismissed the implications . " Lots of names get kicked around . It 's no big deal . " But it was a big deal . The incoming administration was pro-business , particularly favorable to energy producers . The new Secretary of Energy would be responsible for turning the industry 's wish list into public law . More important , she knew that John wanted it . Instead of courting important men , he would be one being courted . The position would be his entry into public life , with all its social and financial perks . The repute that came from rubbing elbows with the president would lead to book advances , speaking fees , maybe even a university chair . All heady stuff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry . Pam knew that John would go through a detailed vetting . The new president 's team would scrutinize every detail of his life , looking for breaches of the law or of public morality that could embarrass the administration . Ideal candidates had been unceremoniously dumped because the family maid was an illegal immigrant , or because they did n't pay a nanny 's Social Security . A vice presidential candidate had lost out when it was discovered he had seen a psychiatrist . A Supreme Court candidate had been rocked by charges of sexism . More than likely , they would ask John about the state of his marriage . He would have to tell them about her , because there was every chance that they would find out anyway . From the day his name came up , detectives had probably been following him . A panel truck full of radio equipment was probably homing in on his cell phone calls . More than likely , someone at the post office was watching his mail . But even when he told them , Pam did n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on affairs in the White House ? Were n't congressmen balling their interns ? By comparison , her relationship with John was proper and discreet . He had a lovely wife who presided over a household in Connecticut to which he frequently returned . She was the daughter of a politically connected family that had made its fortune in shipping , running molasses and hardware to the Caribbean , and bringing back rum and slaves . Two of her forebears had served as state representatives to the United States Congress , and two recent presidents had dined with members of the family while campaigning in the state . One of her cousins , Benjamin Porter , was the majority whip in the House . She was known to politicians of every stripe , and Pam had no doubt that her influence had been critical to John 's selection for a cabinet post . Catherine was at his side in all his official photographs and joined him at important functions , always smiling at him adoringly even though they had separate bedrooms . She was the woman who would be at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be photographed with the president 's wife . She was the perfect companion for his public life . He also had a mistress , who was invisible to the outside world . She had no desire for notoriety , was content to live backstage , and would never do anything to embarrass his wife or jeopardize his public image . She was a perfect companion in his private life . It all worked very well , so why should the administration 's inquisitors be concerned ? Surely they had more incendiary issues to deal with . He came to her apartment on a Monday night after spending a weekend in Connecticut , gave Pam a distracted kiss , and opened a bottle of a modest wine they both liked . He put the bottle on the table that Pam had already set , went to the stereo , and slipped in a jazz CD . Then he eased onto the sofa almost as if he was afraid of crumpling a cushion . " How was your weekend ? " she called from the kitchen . " Okay , " he answered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clung to her when he returned from home , demonstrating how much he had missed her . By now he should have poured the wine , toasted to her beauty , and then plunged into the food preparation , taking every opportunity to brush against her . " A problem ? " " Sure . There 's always a problem . " She dried her hands and stepped out of the kitchen . The table was close to the front door , across from the kitchen counter . He was sitting at the far end of the room , tapping his fingers on the armrest in time to the music . She lit the candle , her signal that dinner was ready . " Anything you want to talk about ? " she asked as she poured the wine . He got up heavily , showing none of the zest he usually brought to their table . " No ... well ... there is . But not now . It will keep until after dinner . " They began silently , John plainly lost in his thoughts and Pam wondering what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take the tension . " What do you think ? " she said , gesturing toward the fish she had served . " Wonderful ! What did you marinate it in ? " His eyes were glazing over before she finished listing the ingredients , but she went on with the details of preparation , trying to keep the conversation alive . " Delicious , " he interjected when he realized she had stopped talking . She tried another tack . " How was the flight ? " " Uneventful , " he said without glancing up . " The best kind . " " Did Catherine pick you up ? " " No , she was busy . I took a limo . " " What was she busy with ? " " The usual nonsense . Nothing important . " Pam was n't going to give up . There had to be something they could talk about . " Let me tell you about my weekend , " she started , but she was cut off by the clatter of his fork falling onto his plate . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than saying them . " Catherine knows about us . " He reached for his wineglass and drained it . " So ? " Pam asked . It was n't a frivolous question . They had often speculated that his wife might already know of their affair and , if not , that she would probably find out . Both of them assumed she would live comfortably with the arrangement , or perhaps demand a divorce . Whichever , it would be a quiet and dignified resolution . Catherine was n't into scenes . " So , " he answered softly , " she wants this ended . " Pam set her fork down and pushed her plate aside . She felt a cold chill of fear and a knot tightening in her throat . She could n't even pretend to eat . " How does she want it ended ? " she managed . " Just ended ! She does n't want me to see you anymore . " He refilled his glass and then tried to pour a bit into Pam 's glass . His hands were shaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't hold eye contact . " What do you want ? " she asked , even though she could already guess his answer . " What I want does n't matter . It 's what I have to do . " He seemed distraught , on the verge of tears . " What do you have to do ? " she asked . He half-turned away from her . " Do you have to give me up ? " He nodded . " That 's Catherine 's price . " She did n't understand . Price for what ? What was John 's wife holding over his head ? " Her price for my nomination to go through . Catherine has connections all over the government . If she makes it known that she would rather not have me burdened with the demands of public life , the administration will find a more available candidate . Christ , the only reason my name came up in the first place is that the new people are trying to suck up to her family . They 'd love to get her cousin in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went to the stereo , and snapped off the jazz combo . Then he sat down on the sofa , this time heavily , as if he were falling into a great , black hole . Pam followed and took a chair across from him . " If I understand you , I 'm not sure that I 'm being dropped because of Catherine . It sounds more as if I 'm losing out to a job in the new president 's cabinet . " He shook his head slowly . " Catherine is n't giving me any leeway . " " No , " Pam corrected . It 's your ambition that is n't giving you any leeway . You want the job more than you want me . " " That 's not true , " he wailed . " You know I love you . But Catherine has me by the short hairs . " He was up on his feet and pacing in front of her . " I think she knew about us from the beginning . She 's been biding her time , playing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she could crush me like a bug . Now she has it . She pushed my nomination just so she could dangle it over me . " Pam caught his arm and turned him toward her . " If there 's no nomination , then she has nothing to dangle over you . Call her right now and tell her you 've decided not to join the administration . You 'll still have the institute , and we 'll still have each other . " " It 's not that simple , " he answered curtly . " Catherine could make one hell of a scene . " " And drag her illustrious family through the tabloids ? " Pam reminded him . " Catherine will never let that happen . She 'll accept the present arrangement or arrange a very quiet and dignified divorce . Either way , we 'll still be together . " She looked toward the telephone , and his eyes followed . But when he saw the handset on the end table , he turned his head away . " Damn it ! It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more complicated . " That was true , Pam thought . She had never been able to explain why she was in love with John , or why their relationship was the anchor of her life . She could n't expect him to explain why a short-lived position in the executive branch would be such an aphrodisiac for him . Sometimes people , or places , or titles , or opportunities simply became irresistible . Few people could explain all the choices that had shaped their lives , so it was n't fair to demand an explanation . " What are you going to do ? " she asked sympathetically . She was trying to help him focus rather than demanding an answer . " I do n't know . It 's all so sudden . A few days ago I had everything . Now I 'm afraid that I 'm going to lose it all . " " Is there anything I can do to help ? " " Just bear with me for a while . " He reached across the table and touched her hand . Continues ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
