Playing video games may be fun , but you ca n't make a living at it . Or can you ? A small but growing cadre of quick-fingered keyboard jockeys have joined the circuit as professional video-game players , and with at least three pro leagues paying out more than $1 million in prize money annually , a few are doing quite well . <P> Next week 600 gamers from 55 countries will compete in Seoul , South Korea , at the third annual World Cyber Games for prizes worth $350,000 .

And the $10 billion-a-year gaming industry hopes the sport will catch on as a way to spark more interest and sell even more titles .
