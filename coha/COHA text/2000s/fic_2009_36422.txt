* <br> Occasionally , actually quite often , someone will refer to a family or person as dysfunctional . Which , I believe , is a sign of ignorance , for the obvious reason that 70 or 80 percent of all the people who have ever lived were dysfunctional . The other 20 or 30 percent tried to be , or had sense enough to be , a little wiser . Among them , the greatest were disliked , hated , killed , or crucified . And they were n't even perfect , except one . <br> For instance they crucified Jesus of Nazareth , and all his disciples , Martin Luther King , Jr. , Mahatma Gandhi , and others . People who thought as much or more of others than they did of themselves . People killed the people who seemed to wish good things for mankind . <br> Throughout the history of mankind the struggle for survival on this earth has been extremely , horribly intense and never ending . Wars have been fought , almost continually , when there were enough people to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called on to die for their leader , country , or the current god . Then there was slavery ; every country or body wanted a slave . Someone to do their work or make money for them . Sometimes slaves were all a war was about . And , if not a whole war , then groups , communities , families , and friends would fight and kill each other . Ai n't that interesting ? <br> Not just African slaves ; every nationality alive has been a slave , at some time , for some other nation . Believe me . It would seem most of mankind likes killing . For Greed of something , for Gold or financial reward . They doing it now ! <br> You probably know all about history so let us skip , for my purpose , to the twentieth century . People are still fighting slavery in one form or another . In many parts of the world women are fighting for food or medicine , a roof for their children , or some way to keep from being raped , while some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behinds , breasts , and everything else they can get out in front of somebody . <br> In several other parts of the world people are being denied their life , or stolen from their life to be sold . Children are being stolen , every day , killed or given away . Everything I can think of , you already know . <br> I believe all anyone wants is to be " happy . " Everyone just wants to be happy . Why are they not happy ? Other people . <br> Black people , Brown people , Native Americans are treated abominably . White races are not excluded . Poor white people have a struggle to survive also , no matter what they may think . Poor is the operative word . And yet . . . No one wants to leave this earth .

If not they , then an ancestor lied and deceived , even murdered . <br> You may believe me or not . I do n't mind . The truth is not popular . <br> I truly marvel at the struggle for Love . <br> Parents , children , relatives , all people are part of it . I 'm leaving out the insane or mindless ; but they , too , usually respond to love and kindness . <br> Some people think this struggle for love makes the doing of all mean , petty , even evil things necessary . Why ? Stupid and mindless is my guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them . <br> Sometimes it 's a struggle to get over self-love first . Sometimes in this struggle for love , we give up , or lose , everything , and we still do n't achieve love . Some people do n't even recognize real love when it comes without being called or sought . <br> Well , I want to tell you this story : this strange , sad , kind'a beautiful , life story . I want to speak about Love , chile . <br> Chapter 2 <br> * <br> In the early twentieth century Wideland was an ordinary , small town in Oklahoma where the ordinary people were beginning to prosper a bit , and the town was expanding . The railroad came in 1907 , and by 1910 , the steady building-up , all the activity and prosperity , had drawn people of many backgrounds to Wideland . Local calamities , diseases , floods , hurricanes , famine , also sent many people out of their lands , or homes , to seek something better . <br> In a restless , young country there are many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if possible , labor , surely , and pursue some happiness . As usual , there were small investors seeking a better start where everything was needed ; items and services were bought and traded briskly . The mentally crooked always follow , bringing hurt and pain for someone . <br> Wideland was a nice little town grown up from a village with a good reputation . People came seeking to make a home for their family and future . Large enough to have several churches , two pharmacies , and two doctors , one good one ; they both served the small hospital that was for emergencies . A variety of small clothing stores for men and women ; working clothes , nothing too grand . Small secondhand shops for everyone . <br> Wideland even had two small banks , whose owners created the Society , those that considered themselves the elite . There were lumberyards , a hardware store , and a few good-sized stores for buying food and necessities . Farmers and others provided a place for people to bring things to sell or barter ; things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the striving poor . <br> A small police station , a small shack for the post office , and a new courthouse to be proud of were built near a large creek diverted off the Long River that ran alongside Wideland . There were many whites , some Blacks and Native Americans , a few Asians . For a long time there was one lawyer , now there were two . More people meant more problems , so the attorneys made a living . <br> Wideland had good weather and bad weather , none was extreme except occasionally . It was an easy town to live in . <br> An African American cowboy , Val Strong , and his Native American Cherokee brother-friend , Wings , came to town to find , or build , a house for the pretty young woman Val had recently married , Irene Lowell . They rode in on horses they had caught , broken , and trained themselves . That was their way of life . <br> Val 's mother was a strong , lovely Native American . His father , an African , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his slave-master and lived with the Indians for years . He had been killed in one of the wars or skirmishes the U.S. fought against the Indians . For the land the Indian was born in , and the land the white man had sailed into . <br> Val had been raised with the Native Americans and in his heart he was a young , strong Brave . Wings had been his friend of his youth , and indeed , he was a young strong Brave . <br> They wore cowboy hats , and leather pants and boots , even with spurs on their boots . They were handsome , indeed ! They worked together running cattle for anyone who had cattle to run from one destination to another . Sometimes they crossed several states : New Mexico , Texas , Kansas , Arizona , even New Jersey , and farther . They had driven cattle as far east as they cared to go . They were leery about people who were too strange . They were quiet and kept themselves apart , except from the men they worked with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Val had saved all his working life , about fifteen years . Now he had a sizable sum to purchase a house for his new wife ; she did not want to live on a reservation . He was eager to start his new life . He was in love . <br> As he had passed through Wideland many times , he observed the town and the people . The sky was deep blue and stretched to far , far yonder , and was full of enchanting voluptuous clouds . Plenty of pretty birds , fish , and animals lived there . He loved all the natural beauty of God 's creations . He also wanted to stay near the reservation . <br> He did n't know how deep the little town was , but he knew it was long ; it stretched a long , long way to the north and south , following the river . He decided his wife , and later , children , would be safe when he was away on a cattle drive . It seemed a town where a family could live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was around thirty years old when he married Irene . Irene was from a little town near Wideland . She had learned to read , write , and cipher , and shared her knowledge in a little shack with a sign nailed over the door saying " School . " She had no teaching certificate , but taught all ages and colors . She dearly needed the money for she meant to be independent , and had no help . <br> There were n't many students in her classes at a time ; who had the money ? Older people knew the advantages of being able to read and count ; they came , and brought their children and grandchildren . She charged a pittance , and that was all her living . <br> She helped serve two meals a day at Mz . Shaw 's rooming house , where she lived . Irene also helped clean the other guest rooms in exchange for her own tiny room , and the small shack she used for a teaching classroom . <br> Mz . Shaw owned the room and boardinghouse . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they were most all men . Irene kept her eyes down in the dining room as she did her duties . But when Val came through the town on a cattle drive and stayed overnight at Mz . Shaw 's , she had noticed him . <br> She saw that whenever she raised her eyes , he was always looking at her . After the first time he saw her , he returned about every two weeks . He changed ; he did not sleep out in the fields under the stars with his herding partner , Wings ( sometime called just " Wing " ) , as had been his habit . He slept at Mz . Shaw 's when in Wideland . <br> Mz . Shaw 's was not the best place to stay in Wideland , but colored people were not allowed to stay everywhere , and Val would not spend his hard-earned money just for a place to sleep . He was used to sleeping outdoors under the stars until winter moved over the land . Mz . Shaw 's was honest , clean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shaw , was good , better than that at the " best " houses . <br> Irene had tried to pay as little attention to Val as necessary , except a few quick glances across the table . She thought he was handsome , but she was looking for a better job or way to make a living . She would rather have a good job than a poor husband . " He probably already married anyway , " she thought , and put him out of her mind . " No time for that foolishness ! " <br> She thought a lot about a husband ; someone to help her , protect her . She prayed a lot at night , asking , " Lord , please direct my feet cause how can I know what to do ? " But Irene had good sense , and the Lord probably let her lead her own self ; because how else is a person going to learn ? <br> Val had asked Mz . Shaw if Miss Lowell was married , and when he found out she was not , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had that information , on his next trip he brought her an ocean-colored turquoise flower . He gave it to her , saying , " That 's what color the ocean look like . " She could only sigh , " Ohhhhhhhhh , " with a smile . <br> Irene loved the lovely little jewel . It was her first real gift from a man she did not think could be expecting anything from her . She looked into his face , still smiling as she thanked him , and walked away . She had not had so many experiences that she knew exactly what a person did in " courting , " she had learned mostly what not to do . But she remembered to smile at him again as she placed his gift gently and firmly in her apron pocket . <br> Irene was a medium-sized woman , bright and healthy . She had smooth browngold skin and clear , hazel eyes like dusky sunshine . Even though they were sad eyes , they were bright and honest , seeking some happiness , yet reserved and subdued . Irene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ survive ever since she could remember . She had run away from a motherless home , at last , five years ago . Running from her father , brothers , uncles , and white men pulling after her body . <br> Irene , clean , mannerable , and presenting herself well , had found work as a servant to a family with three children . It was a fairly wealthy house , and they spent good money on the children 's education and tutors . Irene always sat in on all their classes for the five years she was there . <br> She had learned to read and write and more , along with the children . She was alert to life 's demands . Her learning was her tool for her living . Now she taught what she had learned . She still had her same books , loved , worn , but very well cared for . She taught from them , sometimes copied from them for her students , but seldom let anyone touch them . No , sir ! <br> Now , Val thought of her very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indian family , but sometimes he had looked at American houses in passing . He wondered at the privacy and quiet inside those rooms . Native Americans lived in many types of structures . Some even built low , flat houses similar to the white man 's before the white man came . But those were Indians who worked the land , not migrating with the seasons and animals . <br> Val , being a young healthy man , looked at all women , their clothes , their ways . He was handsome , and they looked at him , too . He did not like the white women because of his family 's history with white men , but he knew there were Brown women , and women who were Black , like his father . And now , he had met one . He liked the women on his reservation , but felt like they were sisters . " Oh , Irene , Irene . " <br> It had taken a few months , though he asked often , before Irene allowed him to take walks with her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had a healthy and wise fear of them . <br> Val , with good sense , was patient . He was a thoughtful man , and discovered she liked books and learning . He could not read , but he had brought her a few books here and there , wherever he could find them . Spelling books , simple reading books , and even one from Europe he had found in a bartering shop . The books pleased her ; that made him happy . <br> Continues ...
