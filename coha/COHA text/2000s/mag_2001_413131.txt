Guide To Finding Scholarships A survey by the American Council on Education showed that Americans still believe a college education is worth the money . However , 71% believe college is getting less affordable . Additionally , 83% of African Americans and 79% if Hispanics are more likely to think that college is not affordable . And while there are many books and financial-aid counselors available , many of us still do n't know where to get reliable information about financing a college education . Every parent would love for their child to receive a full-tuition scholarship . But unless your child has an outstanding academic record or exceptional athletic ability , he or she may not be eligible for such aid . Several years ago , I did some freelance work for a foundation that provided scholarships to graduating seniors . To my surprise , there are many scholarships that do not require students to have extremely high grade point averages , extreme financial need or great athletic ability . While some of these scholarships wo n't pay fun-tuition ( some were as low as $100 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay room and board for a year , or supplement other fees that are associated with attending a post-secondary institution . And unlike the federal grants and loans , most of these scholarships do not require a parent to submit tax forms or wade through lengthy applications . However , they do require that students take an active role in applying for the scholarship . That is , the student either writes an essay , has a personal interview with a committee , supplies reference letters from teachers , employers or others in the community  --  or all of these activities . When do I begin looking for scholarships ? When to begin looking for scholarships is more important than where to look for scholarships . If you and your child wait until senior year to begin looking for funding , you have greatly limited your success . While there are scholarships out there , there are not enough to provide money to every child that wants or deserves one . I began looking at the different types of scholarships available when my daughter was in eighth grade . She is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when she is a senior . Early on , I realized that the successful candidates had built " resumes " during their secondary education . Most scholarships require students to show a record of leadership , community involvement , or academic achievement over a period of time . The longer a child can show continued involvement in activities in the area the scholarship requires , the better his or her chances are of receiving funds . Maximize your child 's interest  --  not yours Your child may need to show a record of activity in the community or through school or church . It may be hard for some parents to allow their children to choose their own activities . And sometimes a little guidance is necessary . But it is important that the child has an interest in the activity . If the child likes the activity , they will not only participate as a member , but also strive to take a leadership role in the organization . I developed a plan for my daughter when she was in the eighth grade . At the beginning of the school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting and offered the most challenge . I had only one requirement : one of the activities had to be academic in nature , focusing on participate either for a semester or the entire school year . By mandating the length of participation , she chose very wisely . Also , it gave her enough time in the organization to evaluate whether to continue the following year . She tried participating in an athletic activity , but at the end of the season she decided that it was not for her . However , she did stay throughout the entire season . If asked , she can add this to an application . It is also good for the child to show a record of community service and leadership . Consider organizations such as the scouts , 4-H club , church committees or civic groups that provide service projects at least once a year . And do n't limit your child to local activities . If you can , try to involve them in regional , state and national activities as well . Summer is important , too Your child should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may choose to work while others may attend an athletic or academic-enrichment programs . They should attend a program where they can walk away from the experience with a broader view of themselves , the subject and the world . Summer is also an excellent time to develop hobbies . Do n't down play the hobbies your children have . My daughter loves to sew and create art objects . Those activities show creativity and tenacity . Hobbies such as building model cars or landscaping may prove to have hidden value . There may be scholarships available for those interests . Put those activities and their outcome on the application Under hobbies , skills and accomplishments . Applying for scholarships is just like applying for a job . You have to show a record of achievement and skills that fit the position in order to get the job . So it is with scholarships . Build a solid resume . Where do I find these scholarships ? Your child 's school is a good resource for scholarships . Guidance counselors are usually the first point of contact . But it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So , it is really up to the student to check for information on his or her own . Along with scanning the local newspaper under organization news , here are a few places to check : Businesses and Corporations . Start with businesses and corporations in your town or in your state . Their requirements may be less strenuous than some of the national companies . Call the public relations department for information . They will be able to lead you in the right direction . After you have explored your options with the locals , begin to look for scholarships from the national companies like Ford Motor Company and Coca-Cola , to name a few . An internet search is a great way to research other prospects . Private Scholarships/Foundations . Private scholarships are provided by trust funds , memorial funds , foundations or individuals . Some private scholarships are available as early as the junior year in high school . These scholarships may have very specific requirements such as residence , school , interests or hobbies . Clubs and Groups in Your Community . Even if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organizations , your child may still be eligible based on his involvement in the community .

These organizations may be offering money to students . Religious Organizations . Churches and other places of worship often sponsor scholarships . Also , check with worship-oriented service groups . You may not have to be a member . Some will provide scholarships to students who plan on studying in the particular religion . Minority Organizations . To provide for increased minority diversity , many sororities or fraternities , and some civic organizations use race , ethnicity , religion , or gender as eligibility requirements for their scholarships .
