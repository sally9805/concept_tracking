Section : SCIENCE America 's top naval architects compete to build a new class of fast and deadly warship . DEFENSE <p> It happened in an instant . One moment , a perfectly routine refueling operation was under way . The next moment , the crew of the USS Cole was struggling to keep the missile cruiser afloat . For the family and friends of the 17 sailors who died , it was tragedy beyond imagination . Aden , Yemen , was , after all , supposed to be a friendly port of call . For the navies of the world , the explosion delivered a powerful message : Modem warships are as vulnerable to suicide bomber attacks as tourists on crowded buses in Israel . What terrified admirals was not that a lone fanatic might repeat the Oct. 12 , 2000 , attack . The nightmare scenario was that a group of small boats would swarm a ship like killer bees . And that amid this confusion , an antiship missile would be fired at an aircraft carrier . Almost certainly the missile would be shot down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upside-down world of international terrorism , the fact that someone could draw close enough to strike a crown jewel of the American fleet would be viewed as a stunning Al Qaeda victory . <p> A Navy report issued after the attack on the Cole summed up the new threat to American sea power . " The current world environment requires us to operate in the backyards of tough , unyielding zealots . They do n't want us there . They want us to stand off , farther and farther . To what degree do we influence events at sea and ashore , at a time and place of our choosing , if we are compelled to remain at arm 's length for every power projection transaction ? " <p> It did not take the Navy long to realize that it already had the rough outline for a new type of vessel to counter the threat posed by international terrorists . The Navy calls it a Littoral Combat Ship ( LCS ) . " Littoral Combat Ships have been part of Navy concept development and experimentation since 1999 , " says a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Newport , R.I. " In the Title X Global war game series , in the DARPA-sponsored Capabilities for the Navy After Next war games , in Fleet Battle Experiments and in other field and lab experiments , LCSs have had capabilities ranging from information operations to mine countermeasures to anti-submarine warfare to supporting special operations . Fleet commanders and battle group commanders have praised their attributes . " DARPA refers to the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency . <p> The idea for an LCS took a major step toward becoming an actual vessel with its inclusion in a Department of Defense planning document known as " Defense Planning Guidance ; Fiscal Years 2003-2007 . " The report specifically directs the Navy to develop capabilities for dealing with the sorts of threats that could be mounted by rogue nations and international terrorists . The most important mission for the LCS is to keep the operating area around aircraft carrier battle groups clear of submarine-delivered and floating mines . Related to this is the need to improve the naval fleet 's ability to destroy or evade large numbers of submarines operating in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to the NWDC , several factors make the LCS a good vessel for conducting anti-submarine warfare in littoral waters . " Because of its high sprint speed , shallow draft , and its ability to operate over the horizon , the need for escort and protection is greatly reduced , allowing other assets to be freed up for power projection missions and other tasking . With active torpedo defense technology , the LCS can play a role analogous to an area air defense AEGIS ship . An LCS can sprint with towed or deployed anti-torpedo capability to counter attacks from quiet diesel submarines . " <p> And , hearkening back to the fears raised after the Cole episode , the Navy wants to be able to destroy waves of small antiship cruise-missile-armed boats or merchant ships , without drawing upon the aircraft on its carriers . <p> " The future for the U.S. Navy-Marine Corps team requires us to dominate the near-land battle space and provide access for our joint combat team , " says Chief of Naval Operations Adm . Vern Clark . " Our enemies will continue to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the asymmetric advantage that will allow us to dominate in this critical area . We need this capability as quickly as we can get it to the fleet . " Platform Approach <p> The LCS will be fast , lethal and incorporate the most advanced active and passive stealth technology . But most striking is the way naval architects will approach its design - as if they were creating an airplane rather than a warship . <p> Historically , American warships have been designed for specific tasks . The driving force behind a ship 's design is its weaponry . A warship 's very structure is part of the weapons systems it carries . And , that 's exactly the opposite of what the Pentagon has in mind for the LCS . <p> In designing the LCS , the Pentagon wants architects to follow the model developed by the aircraft industry . That is , they want the LCS to be a seagoing platform with weapons viewed as plug-and-play accessories . Many of the weapons that the LCS will carry , including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles ( UAVs ) , are themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that an LCS can be configured to operate across a spectrum of military operations , from delivering emergency aid after an earthquake to depositing special forces to trouble spots . <p> Controlling the flow of illegal arms shipments is yet another mission envisioned for the LCS . NWDC planners sketched this scenario : A 6-ship LCS squadron is under way to investigate possible violation of a United Nations sanction on a rogue nation . Maritime interception has been ordered to investigate suspected arms shipments by a merchant vessel . Two UAVs are launched from an LCS 200 miles from the suspect vessel . One UAV deploys several smaller , autonomous UAVs that monitor communications . Over the radio , the remarks made by the captain of the suspect merchant ship do not coincide with his course tracked by radar . The UAV drops in for a closer look and then transmits images of unusual topside activity . Analysis of this video , conducted thousands of miles away in a Pentagon war room , determines that the crew is preparing to dump the weapons overboard . Three LCSs set an intercept course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firing rifles at the UAV , which , despite taking evasive action , is hit . Two of the three dispatched LCSs coordinate a boarding operation and capture the weapons . The third LCS provides area defense . <p> In a sense , the LCS would be a Swiss Army Knife of a warship , one that would operate in groups in near-shore waters after first crossing 3500 miles of ocean . Selecting A Design <p> This past summer , the Pentagon took the important first step in making those sorts of globally coordinated low-intensity maritime battles a reality . It announced it had selected three contractors to each perform a 7-month preliminary design effort to refine the Navy 's LCS concepts . The winners were General Dynamics-Bath Iron Works of Bath , Maine ; Lockheed Martin Naval Electronics &; Surveillance Systems-Surface Systems of Washington , D.C. ; and Raytheon-Integrated Defense Systems of Portsmouth , R.I. Each contract is worth roughly $10 million . For the winner , there will be a multibillion-dollar payday . The U.S. Navy wants to buy nine of the ships by 2009 . The LCS fleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ encourage original thinking , the Pentagon is letting shipbuilders come up with the details of the LCS design . It will be at least a year before specifications are finalized . What is certain is that whichever design is selected , it will represent a major break from the shape of ships past . According to a Navy briefing paper , " The LCS will feature an advanced hull form and a shallow draft and will be capable of quickly moving through the littoral region at speeds of up to 40 to 50 knots . " The Lockheed Martin LCS is named Sea Blade . Its most distinguishing feature is its shallowdraft , semi-planing hull . The Raytheon-led LCS team is working on a concept based on an all-composite twin-hull catamaran design that uses the latest in composites technology provided by Goodrich Corp . ' s Engineered Polymer Products division . The General Dynamics-Bath Iron Works entry is based on a trimaran hull derived from racing yachts ( " Sea Power 2000 , " Nov. 1999 , page 72 ) . Twin Missions <p> In a briefing paper , the NWDC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adept at two tasks : focused missions and continuing missions . In focused missions , the LCS will employ reconfigurable weapons modules tailored to specific tasks such as anti-submarine warfare ( ASW ) and countering boat attacks like the Cole episode . In either case , a number of ships would operate as part of a distributed force . " For example , one squadron of LCSs may be conducting antisubmarine warfare operations while another is detecting and classifying sea mines , " says the NWDC spokesman . <p> In continuing missions , the ships would be lightly armed , taking on additional weapons as needed to defend themselves from any immediate threat that arises while they conduct intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance . They also could be used to deliver personnel and materiel , perform maritime interception operations , and conduct information warfare . <p> Even though they are designed to work in groups , a single LCS would be a formidable force . One forward-deployed LCS would be able to respond rapidly to a low-threat environment and conduct a wide range of missions , including special operations support , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and medical assistance . <p> " The LCS teams selected represent the best available domestic and international expertise , and reflect strong efforts on the part of industry to provide innovative technologies and operational flexibility for the fleet , " says John Young , Assistant Secretary of the Navy for Research , Development and Acquisition . Next year , the Navy will select the design that will be used for the LCS . If schedules stay on track , the Navy could take delivery of the first of these radical new warships sometime in 2007 . <p> The competition is now between three different hull designs , all of which are fast and stealthy . <p> " The U.S. Navy wants to buy nine of the ships by 2009 . The LCS fleet could grow to as large as 60 .
