Carrie Fisher on being infatuated with a man over 20 years her junior // Photographed by Karl Lagerfeld I swear to you that it was not my idea . I do n't like younger men . I mean , I like them , and they look great in magazines , and I plan on liking one one day or finding him not quite good enough for my daughter but still liking him ... pitying him maybe ... and they can be fun to have around . Even my 30-year-old stepson is really fun , but how did I end up with ... well , I ca n't quite say " infatuated " with someone 23 years younger than myself , but , then again , I ca n't quite not say it : I just do n't want to say it out loud or in front of people I want to respect me . I mean , really-I had an ectopic pregnancy older than him ... I suppose meaning in the land of bad taste and no subtlety that he could be my son . The only great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If people were going to think he was my son , at least let them think I was the mother of a 23-year-old who looked anywhere from okay to pretty damn good for her age . Anyway , the person I am telling you about is a boy named X. A delicately handsome , flirtatious 23-year-old who came into my life via another older woman whose two kids he had been nannying . The woman , like me , is a well-off , divorced writer , dating no one . There were lots of very wealthy women I knew who would not want to cash in their chips on a younger man . There is something unseemly about it . Something very " Have him washed and brought to my tent , " or in this case , " Have him washed and brought to my guesthouse " - which is where this particular newly scrubbed recent teen suddenly was living . X had migrated from NYC to Los Angeles , like five million others , to become an actor . He needed a place to stay . I had an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Done deal . To me , he looked like the boy from the Visconti film Death in Venice . I 'd seen it around age 15 . That boy 's name was Bjorn Andresen and I was so taken with him that I 'd put his picture in my wallet alongside Lenny Bruce , Stan Laurel and forgotten others . Bjorn played the kid in the film with whom Dirk Bogarde became so obsessed that instead of leaving Venice when the cholera epidemic broke out , he stayed just to gape at him , then contracted cholera himself ... and , with mascara running , died . I tell you this because it is essentially what happened to me , minus the cholera and Venice and homosexuality and Visconti . Other than that , the situation was exact . Because , yes , I suppose I did get a little infatuated with X. But not infatuated as I had formerly known it-where you hope for something lasting . I do n't think I ever hoped for anything beyond a kind of ' ' 50s ritual necking . I also did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Things just do n't work that way-in the direction of young men and old women . There is an unwritten law scribbled everywhere that old men can date young women , but the reverse is n't true . What is sadder still is how for years I have mocked older men with younger women-a commonplace coupling all over the world , especially where the man is a man of means . Even a few exes of mine have gotten themselves much younger , newly minted mates fresh off the girlfriend truck . Why should n't I get me some newly minted minion ? Well , for one thing , I still thought it was idiotic , vampiric and gross , but aside from that , I 'm sure it had to be fantastic ! What is age but a number ? I 'll tell you what it is : a very telling number . One that marches you , however reluctantly , toward the disintegration of your appearance and health , ultimately resulting in your death . And the number representing the years between this boy living in my guesthouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents a gulf of experience , choked with time spent here on earth . And yes , sure , some young people are old or wise beyond their years , but more often than not , they 're just a lot younger and in much better shape than us older people . They 're not people you want to disrobe in front of in harsh light or any light for that matter or want to get intimate with where it requires nudity in any way . Maybe it 's not for nothing that I felt this way . I 'd been around these sorts of pairings most of my life . My mother married an older guy after my young father left her . It was as if she ran into his sad , withered arms for safety , figuring ( incorrectly ) that older guys were a better bet , most being too arthritic for additional sexcapades . My father went on to marry a very young woman in one of his many marital misfigurings ; presenting me briefly but all too memorably and horrifically with a stepmother precariously close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mustered the bad judgment required to refer to me on several occasions as " Dear . " Well , I find these alliances somewhat unseemly . At times , even more than somewhat . At times , I 've been known to find them more or less cringe-making , occasionally bordering on gross . But X ? Not a cringe-making combo ... just ... a distracting one . He became my **32;749;TOOLONG , fresh from the oven of the East Coast to me . Originating from a small town in the Northeast , the youngest child of four and only son of a stockbroker mother and stay-at-home dad . His father was very strict and hands on , leaving his mother to immerse herself in her investing ... but for young X , there was no substitute for a mother 's love and imagined ministrations . The upshot of all this , or the bottom line , depending on your trajectory , is I blame the kid for the whole not-much-of-anything thing . But it is totally his fault because he was fucked up about his mother , which made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my den and in his bedroom . Oh yeah , maybe there was also one time in mine . Oh , and possibly a tiny , tragic , abortive make-out thing in my car , but not really porno make-out , so do n't judge me too harshly . Okay , maybe one of those times was a teeny bit porno . So anyway , that 's why I lost the weight ... and started fixing myself up better and wearing things like jeans , which I had completely retired something like 20 years ago . Anyway , my intentions were far from serious . They were barely even intentions . I was just goofing around for the most part . And no , I do n't really blame him , because , duh , yes , I know I 'm the adult here and am supposed to know better , and yes , I 'm accountable-but I can dream , ca n't I ? The flirt thing was hilarious . The shock-value thing was beyond great when I took him to parties and stuff . I mean , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matthew Perry . " So , what ... are you , like , dating this guy ? " he asked . We were in the restaurant Trader Vic 's . I looked at him very seriously and said deadpan , " Yes , we 're very much in love . " X said , " It 's true . We 've been together , like , a few months . " Matthew gazed at me for a long moment , as if perhaps I 'd fold under his silent but brutal cross-examination . " Why is that so weird ? " I inquired . " Men do it all the time . " Matthew 's eyes narrowed . " Okay , if you 're so much in love , make out in front of me for five minutes . " Uh-oh . Which is when X leaned over and put his mouth on my mouth and my mouth got so small ... and our little routine as Hollywood 's newest sad , old/young couple began . There was much laughter in the land then because , of course , we could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not even I could , and I 'm mentally ill , which makes for a good excuse . I 'm not saying that any person somewhat advanced in years who finds themself drawn to an extremely young person has to be mentally ill-not at all . All you need is to have a really good income and be frightened of aging , which results in hoping a younger person on your arm and in your bed will make you look and feel younger and more desirable . Plus , they can push your wheelchair and remind you to take your blood-pressure medicine later on . But , like I said , after the Matthew Perry Incident , X and I did end up making out , in my den and in his bedroom , and in mine , and in the car , and my life was transformed into a wonderland of joy and happiness . Oh , no ... wait ... Well , I guess you know this thing did n't end up falling under the heading of " happily ever after . " It did , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sharing the next-to-last dregs of her fading life with a callow youth who has to look up callow in the dictionary and regularly says " awesome , " " like , " and " dude " ... but who looks great in cutoffs , sprawled on a chaise lounge next to a heated swimming pool . I highly recommend almost doing whatever it was that I never got around to doing with this kid . It 's good for your weight and good for stirring up a string of events providing you with the swirling illusion that something of charm and consequence is taking place in your life . And when it 's done , you return to your regular world with three square meals , four connecting walls , bills , a staff and mortgages . But for a few weeks , you were a giddy , jean-wearing , Norma Desmond fool .
