WHY HERE , WHY NOW : Missoula is a mountain biker 's Eden in early summer . The encircling mountains shed their snow , wildflowers burst from the trailsides , and the many singletracks that sunburst from town are at their tacky best . DIRT : For a perfect welcome-to-Missoula trundle , crank up to the panoramic summit of Mount Sentinel , Missoula 's signature mountain . To get there from downtown , head south on Higgins for a mile-and-a-half , go left on South , then right on Maurice and follow it as it turns to dirt and pitches steeply up the flank of Mount Sentinel . The scenic doubletrack soon slims into the Hidden Treasure trail , a sinuous singletrack that climbs through forest and open mountainside ( with one brief dirt-road stint ) to Sentinel 's summit . Bask in the view , then point it back the same route for your 1,800-foot payoff . If you 've got the time ( and the legs ) for something a little less civilized , the Sheep Mountain Trail-a 35-miler with 4,000 feet of climbing-is Missoula 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the climb is a quad-buster , but views from Sheep Mountain are spectacular and your endorphin valve will open wide on the barn-burning descent . SHOP : Missoula Bicycle Works ( 708 South Higgins Ave. ; 406/721-6525 , missoulabicycleworks.com ) has everything a great shop should : bikes ( Kona , Bianchi , Seven ) , rentals ( full-suspension and hardtail ) , good mechanics and heaps of local knowledge . GRUB : The Old Post ( 103 W. Spruce St. ; 406/721-7399 ) is a classic locals pub with great burgers and local favorite Moose Drool Ale on tap . If you prefer multiple-sized forks in your place setting , head to Finn and Porter ( 100 Madison ; 406/542-4660 ) , where the steak is fine , the wine list encyclopedic , and the deck overlooks the Clark Fork River . If you do n't mind dropping 10 bucks for an omelet , The Shack ( 222 W Main St. ; 406/549-9903 ) has the best breakfasts in town . CRASH : Missoula 's premier digs can be found at the river-side Doubletree Hotel Missoula/Edgewater ( 100 Madison ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bel Aire motel ( 300 E Broadway ; 406/543-3183 ) , where rooms start at $45 and which , like the Edgewater , is walking distance to the aforementioned restaurants. - Aaron Teasdale Sidebar <p>
