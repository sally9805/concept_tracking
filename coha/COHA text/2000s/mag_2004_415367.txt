There were still barren landscapes they had to traverse , hair-raising rapids they had to negotiate and a seemingly endless winter of privation and discomfort they had to survive . Yet they proceeded on , sustained by wild game , fish and the spirit of adventure , and reached their destination in November 1805 . On Sunday , March 23 , 1806 , after spending the winter of 1805-06 at Fort Clatsop near the mouth of the Columbia River on the Oregon side , the explorers headed for home . Once they crossed the Bitterroots and were back on the Missouri River , the downstream trip did n't take so long . On the evening of Sunday , Sept. 21 , 1806 , members of the Corps of Discovery beached their canoes at St. Charles , Mo. , the place where it all started . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of other adventures were about to begin for those mountain men and settlers who followed in their footsteps . " Adventure " is a word that still comes to mind when modern outdoorsmen contemplate the stupendous landscape of the Washington-Oregon border . Here 's a sampling of what awaits you in the Pacific Northwest nowadays . UPLAND BIRD HUNTING IN THE HILL COUNTRY Crossing the Bitterroots left the Corps of Discovery exhausted and weak with hunger . Big game was scarce , but the Columbia River region 's high country and lush valleys harbored blue , ruffed , spruce , sage and sharp-tailed grouse , which the expedition 's journalists lumped together as " pheasants . " Thanks to the Conservation Reserve Program ( CRP ) and farming changes that favor cereal crops , southeastern Washington today is still a paradise for upland bird hunters . Sage grouse and sharptails are no longer numerous enough to provide much hunting opportunity , but other species abound . With the addition of pheasants , chukar and Hungarian partridges , bird hunting between Walla Walla and Spokane is more diverse now than it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is its Feel Free to Hunt land . In eastern Washington alone , the state-run program makes more than 1.5 million acres of private farm and forest available to anyone with a hunting permit . Feel Free to Hunt property is marked with signs along roads . When it comes to a strategically located bird-hunting headquarters , the town of Dayton is as good as it gets . I arrived in this clean-scrubbed little farm community with a shotgun and a fantasy of hunting where the Corps of Discovery had trod . It took me only an hour to learn everything I needed to know to realize my ambition . My source was the other hunters gathered at Cracker B 's Tavern on Main Street . When I left town two days later , I had flushed pheasants on CRP land within sight of the Corps of Discovery 's May 3 , 1806 , lunch site near the north edge of Dayton , shot chukar in the steep Palouse hills at Wooten Wildlife Area east of town and gunned for California quail and blue grouse in abandoned apple orchards and tangled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the places for another day . To say I left eastern Washington satisfied is a considerable understatement . If you get to hunt birds there , you 'll know what I mean .

" William Clark , Nov. 19 , 1805 Surely the men who had been so eager to do battle with grizzly bears would have been equally keen to hook a fish that can weigh as much as 1,800 pounds . It never happened , though . Maybe the explorers were being tight-lipped to protect a honey hole of epic proportions . If so , their secret did n't keep . On autumn weekends , the stunning view of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flotilla of boats . Anglers come to enjoy some of the best sturgeon fishing in the world . On a sturgeon outing with Bill Monroe , outdoor editor of the Portland Oregonian , I watched four men in a small johnboat struggle to land a 10-footer . Taking turns with the rod , they finally worked the leviathan to the surface . When it saw daylight , though , the brute made a lightning run that propelled it completely out of the water twice . Then it dove hard , straightening the brass snap-swivel between the leader and the 80-pound-test main line . How they hoped to boat that monster , I have no idea . Afterward , the fishermen were a study in ambivalence : equal parts thrilled , disappointed and relieved . To do justice to these gargantuan fish , you need a stout , roller-tip rod and a heavy-duty level-wind reel spooled with at least 40-pound-test line . Sturgeon are scent feeders that stay on the bottom , so bait has to be kept there , allowing the current to create a scent trail . An 8- or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Columbia River 's strong current . Using a 15-inch leader of soft , woven Dacron reduces the likelihood that a sturgeon will spit the hook out of its sensitive mouth . Heavy , stainless steel barrel swivels are preferred for joining leader and line . Put your sinker on a slider rig above the barrel swivel to let the bait move freely . Finish your rig with a 7/0 circle hook tied directly to the leader . Regulations require barbless hooks . Bait is gathered during the peak of the smelt run in February and March . No other bait can match these oily little fish , but shad , crayfish , clams , sand shrimp , eels , squid , chicken livers and night crawlers are all acceptable , if not equal , substitutes . When fishing with smelt or shad , thread the hook through the head from top to bottom and secure the rest of the fish with a series of half-hitches looped around its body . Top it off with a dose of fish attractant .

Bank-fishing is a smart choice when the wind is too strong for safe boating . A surf-casting rig with an 8-ounce pyramid sinker will get your bait into the action . The slot-length limit for sturgeon is 42 to 60 inches . Smaller and larger fish must be released unharmed at once . Smoked or grilled , sturgeon backstrap is a gourmet feast . Sturgeon fishing goes on year-round from Bonneville Dam to Astoria , including the lower Willamette River in downtown Portland . The area between Multnomah Falls and the dam accounts for most of the really big fish . The stretch between the dam and Beacon Rock is closed in the spring to protect big fish while they spawn . During the winter smelt run , the best fishing is in the flow between Portland and Longview .

" Sauvie Island Wildlife Area has some of the best duck hunting in Oregon , " says Chuck Lobdell , a Ducks Unlimited biologist . The 15-mile island is only 10 miles west of downtown Portland , where the Willamette meets the Columbia . The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife owns 12,000 acres at the island 's northern end . The remainder is mostly controlled by private hunting clubs . When the fall migration is in full swing , as many as 150,000 ducks and geese show up . This is managed wetland hunting the way it is supposed to be , with plenty of grain and native food plots attracting waterfowl , plus ample refuge areas to keep ducks around . Hunting on the island 's eastern side takes place by reservation only . Hunters without reservations can fill in behind those who limit out early . On the western side of the island , hunting access is assigned by daily drawing . Some hunters get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anywhere within designated areas . A few decoys go a long way .
