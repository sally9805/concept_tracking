Chapped , dry hands and rough , patchy elbows are two signs that you 're not as young as you used to be . But most of us do n't think much about how aging  --  not to mention the desiccating effects of wintry winds and overheating  --  also dries out the thin film of tears that bathes and protects our eyes . For 10 million Americans , the problem is bad enough that they suffer from something called dry-eye syndrome . Their eyes become dry and itchy or , at the other extreme , produce excessive quantities of tears . Their vision may get blurry , or they may find they ca n't leave their contacts in for very long . In severe cases , sufferers develop infections that can lead to blindness . <P> Fortunately , chronically dry eyes can usually be treated . There are dozens of over-the-counter products designed to moisten or lubricate your eyes , but you should resist the temptation to play doctor and instead should seek out an eye-care specialist . Dry eyes may be associated with an underlying medical condition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ infection or something called Sjogren 's syndrome , says Dr. Esen Akpek , an ophthalmologist who runs the dry-eye clinic at Johns Hopkins ' Wilmer Eye Institute . " You can also overdo it with eyedrops and actually wash out your own tears , " Akpek says . Also , watch for products whose active ingredients end with the suffix - zoline . Those are vasoconstrictors designed to reduce redness and should not be used for more than a few days , since they can trigger a rebound effect , increasing redness . <P> Research over the past decade has shown that the film covering your eyes is quite complicated . There 's an inner layer of sugary proteins , followed by a more watery middle layer and then an oily layer on top . Chronic dry eye can result from an imbalance in any part of the film . For example , the oily layer , which is produced by glands at the base of the eyelashes , keeps tears from evaporating too quickly . If you do n't make enough oil , you may need one of the thicker over-the-counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on your eyelids to open the glands . <P> Another potential problem is an inflammatory reaction that can be treated with eyedrops containing cyclosporine . For that , you need a doctor 's prescription . <P> In the meantime , you can help keep your eyes moist by setting up a humidifier , taking frequent breaks from the computer and removing your contacts every now and then .
