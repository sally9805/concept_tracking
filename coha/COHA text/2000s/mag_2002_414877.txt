Section : Methods AND Materials <p> One of the most famous details in art must be the large pearl ear ring in Vermeer 's Girl With a Pearl Earring . Cover this one object and the impact of the entire painting is minimized . Perhaps it is the opportunity to create such a tremendous effect that overwhelms artists when they are deciding what small marks will leave a big impression . <p> Guy Diehl claims he tried to avoid details for years , but one look at his current work shows his diligence in every aspect of his luminous paintings , including the details . For this Mill Valley , California , acrylic painter , detail is not just , for example , embroidery on a dress , but " any key element that goes into a painting , " he remarks . " This can be the surface texture of objects , the exact play of light and shadow , or the number of parts in any area . " In Diehl 's 30 years of painting details he has learned to follow the simple maxim that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is appropriate and leave out what is not necessary , " he states , adding that typically he edits half the details he sees . " By paying attention to only the important details , I can make a painting that is more interesting . I think this is a universal problem that artists have dealt with all along  --  putting in too much detail versus not enough . " <p> When Diehl considers adding a detail , his first concern is not one of paint but of personal comfort . " I have to decide up front if it is worth the effort , " he says , adding that he makes the determination based on the complexity and time involved . " I also have to feel confident in my ability to paint it . If I do n't feel ready to tackle a certain subject , I will wait . For example , I do n't usually pursue a complicated flower unless it 's absolutely necessary . In general , I think artists take on too much detail too early in their careers . They bite off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's wrong with their work . " <p> Diehl 's favorite subjects are books , particularly those about artists , which allow him to pay homage to painters he admires . " The majority of these books are fictitious , " he explains , " so I compose the still life using garden books and cookbooks for the shapes and colors . " Then he takes photographs of the setup and projects the best one onto the canvas as a guide . " The photos capture an exact light , so I can work even if the light on the still life changes . However , " he continues , " the still life is set up if I need to examine a detail more closely . " <p> As the books usually do n't exist , to create a title on the spine that appears in perspective the artist uses his computer . He types in the title text and skews it using a graphics program . He then prints it out in the correct size , makes a stencil , and traces it onto the canvas . Diehl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for many other details , a magnifier is necessary . He employs a visor of sorts that he slips over his reading glasses . <p> Diehl works on a pristine gessoed canvas with acrylic paint mixed with gel medium that has been diluted with 3 parts water to 1 part gel . To that he adds a touch of drying retarder and flow medium . The artist also keeps a fine-mist spritzer with water and flow medium on hand . " The flow medium breaks the surface tension of the water and makes it easier to achieve effects , " he comments . " I ca n't tolerate the oil environment , so I developed this technique with acrylic to give me the rich look of oil . " He wields bristle brushes that he hand-pares to the shape of a filbert , as the synthetic brushes traditionally used with acrylics are too limp for his technique . <p> Many artists struggle with making a seamless transition from light to dark or from one color to another ; it is a detail for which Diehl has constructed a unique method @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explains , " I mix four colors or values of the color , lay them in , and physically blend them as much as I can . It 's still a raw blend because I can see my brushstrokes . I save the four colors in jars and let the area dry overnight . The next day I do a second layer with the colors starting at one end of the transition and slowly working toward the other , making the transitions smoother . As a final layer I put the same four colors down and lightly pass a large house-painting brush over them . After each pass I wipe the brush clean on a rag . If I need to , I spray a bit more water on it to keep the paint workable . " <p> Bright highlights and darker shadows are common details , and it is important to Diehl that they are integrated into a painting , not just marks made on the surface . He gives the example of students painting a red ball : " A typical problem is that they apply a white dot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ color for the shadow . For the white to become part of the painting , it 's important to create the transitions that lead to the highlight . On the red ball I would first paint the degrees of pink that fall between the red and the highlight . Only last would I put the dot of white on the core of that pink for the highlight . These transitions are equally important in the shadows . " <p> The edges between a subtle background and sharp objects are also a critical detail for Diehl , so he uses masking tape to guarantee clean edges . " I often tape the whole subject and foreground before painting the background , " he says . " After applying the tape I seal the edges with gel medium so my paint does n't run under it . " He may occasionally apply tape over a painted background to protect it as he renders his subject , but not usually . <p> A painting of approximately 30 ? x 40 ? takes Diehl two to three weeks to finish if he puts in six- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blocking in the simpler areas and the background . " I save the hardest elements or the most critical details for last , " the artist remarks . " When the painting is about 80-percent finished , I decide what details to bring up . I often crop my reference photo to focus my attention on the area I 'm working on , and I use a mirror to look at a painting along the way . It 's a process of taking things slowly and trying not to rush ahead . " <p> Again and again Diehl returns to the importance of simplifying details . He is in awe of Renaissance works that depict books so minutely that every bit of text on a painted page is readable . But the artist does n't spend his time going into such a fine detail . He states , " My concern is not to paint every word on-a page or every pore on an orange but to look closely and understand exactly how the light and shadow play off the object . It 's a fine-tuning of my eye so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surfaces . I want to make strong statements with simplification . I ask myself what is the pure essence of the surface , and I try to paint it . It 's a bit of trial and error at first , but when I get the painting right , it begins talking back to me and says it needs more of this or that . At that point detail becomes convincing .

Although Diehl is in awe of Renaissance paintings in which the text on the page of a painted book is legible , he considers knowing what details to paint to be critical to a painting 's success . Notice that if there is any text on the right page , it is concealed by the dark book on top . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Still Life With Duchamp , Freud , and Darwin , by Guy Diehl , 2000 , acrylic , 26 x 30 . Because the books he paints do not actually exist , Diehl uses a computer graphics program to create the spine text , then makes a stencil with which he traces the lettering on the painting . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Still Life With Billie Holiday , by Guy Diehl , 2000 , acrylic , 26 x 32 . <p> By Christopher Willard <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
