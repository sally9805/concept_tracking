Undercover among America 's secret theocrats Photograph // And a man 's foes shall be they of his oum household . - Matthew 10:36 his is how they pray : a dozen clear-eyed , smooth-skinned " brothers " gathered together in a huddle , arms crossing arms over shoulders like the weave of a cable , leaning in on one another and swaying like the long grass up the hill from the house they share . The house is a handsome , gray , two-story colonial that smells of new carpet and Pine-Sol and aftershave ; the men who live there call it Ivanwald . At the end of a tree-lined cul-de-sac , quiet but for the buzz of lawn mowers and kids playing foxes-and-hounds in the park across the road , Ivanwald sits as one house among many , clustered together like mushrooms , all devoted , like these men , to the service of Jesus Christ . The men tend every tulip in the cul-de-sac , trim every magnolia , seal every driveway smooth and black as boot leather . And they pray , assembled at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or in the bunk room or on the basketball court , each man 's head bowed in humility and swollen with pride ( secretly , he thinks ) at being counted among such a fine corps for Christ , among men to whom he will open his heart and whom he will remember when he returns to the world not born-again but remade , no longer an individual but part of the Lord 's revolution , his will transformed into a weapon for what the young men call " spiritual war . " " Jeff , will you lead us in prayer ? " Surely , brother . It is April 2002 , and I have lived with these men for weeks now , not as a Christian-a term they deride as too narrow for the world they are building in Christ 's honorbut as a " believer . " I have shared the brothers " meals and their work and their games . I have been numbered among them and have been given a part in their ministry . I have wrestled with them and showered with them and listened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's fortune and which man succumbed to the flesh of a woman not once but twice and which man dances so well he is afraid of being taken for a fag . I know what it means to be a " brother , " which is to say that I know what it means to be a soldier in the army of God . " Heavenly Father , " I begin . Then , " O Lord , " but I worry that this does n't sound intimate enough . I settle on , " Dear Jesus . " " Dear Jesus , just , please , Jesus , let us fight for Your name . " . Ivanwald , which sits at the end of Twentyfourth Street North in Arlington , Virginia , is known only to its residents and to the members and friends of the organization that sponsors it , a group of believers who refer to themselves as " the Family . " The Family is , in its own words , an " invisible " association , though its membership has always consisted mostly of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) , Charles Grassley ( R. , Iowa ) , Pete Domenici ( R. , N.Mex . ) , John Ensign ( R. , Nev . ) , James Inhofe ( R. , Okla . ) , Bill Nelson ( D. , Fla. ) , and Conrad Burns ( R. , Mont. ) are referred to as " members , " as are Representatives Jim DeMint ( R. , S.C. ) , Frank Wolf ( R. , Va . ) , Joseph Pitts ( R. , Pa . ) , Zach Wamp ( R. , Tenn. ) , and Bart Stupak ( D. , Mich . ) . Regular prayer groups have met in the Pentagon and at the Department of Defense , and the Family has traditionally fostered strong ties with businessmen in the oil and aerospace industries . The Family maintains a closely guarded database of its associates , but it issues no cards , collects no official dues . Members are asked not to speak about the group or its activities . The organization has operated under many guises , some active , some defunct : National @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National Leadership Council , Fellowship House , the Fellowship Foundation , the National Fellowship Council , the International Foundation . These groups are intended to draw attention away from the Family , and to prevent it from becoming , in the words of one of the Family 's leaders , " a target for misunderstanding . " The Family 's only publicized gathering is the National Prayer Breakfast , which it established in 1953 and which , with congressional sponsorship , it continues to organize every February in Washington , D.C. Each year 3,000 dignitaries , representing scores of nations , pay $425 each to attend . Steadfastly ecumenical , too bland most years to merit much press , the breakfast is regarded by the Family as merely a tool in a larger purpose : to recruit the powerful attendees into smaller , more frequent prayer meetings , where they can " meet Jesus man to man . " In the process of introducing powerful men to Jesus , the Family has managed to effect a number of behind-the-scenes acts of diplomacy . In 1978 it secretly helped the Carter Administration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anwar Sadat , and more recently , in 2001 , it brought together the warring leaders of Congo and Rwanda for a clandestine meeting , leading to the two sides ' eventual peace accord last July . Such benign acts appear to be the exception to the rule . During the 1960s the Family forged relationships between the U.S. government and some of the most anti-Communist ( and dictatorial ) elements within Africa 's postcolonial leadership . The Brazilian dictator General Costa e Silva , with Family support , was overseeing regular fellowship groups for Latin American leaders , while , in Indonesia , General Suhatto ( whose tally of several hundred thousand " Communists " killed marks him as one of the century 's most murderous dictators ) was presiding over a group of fifty Indonesian legislators . During the Reagan Administration the Family helped build friendships between the U.S. government and men such as Salvadoran general Carlos Eugenios Vides Casanova , convicted by a Florida jury of the torture of thousands , and Honduran general Gustavo Alvarez Martinez , himself an evangelical minister , who was linked to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We work with power where we can , " the Family 's leader , Doug Coe , says , " build new power where we ca n't . " At the 1990 National Prayer Breakfast , George H.W. Bush praised Doug Coe for what he described as " quiet diplomacy , I would n't say secret diplomacy , " as an " ambassador of faith . " Coe has visited nearly every world capital , often with congressmen at his side , " making friends " and inviting them back to the Family 's unofficial headquarters , a mansion ( just down the road from Ivanwald ) that the Family bought in 1978 with $1.5 million donated by , among others , Tom Phillips , then the C.E.O . of arms manufacturer Raytheon , and Ken Olsen , the founder and president of Digital Equipment Corporation . A waterfall has been carved into the mansion 's broad lawn , from which a bronze bald eagle watches over the Potomac River . The mansion is white and pillared and surrounded by magnolias , and by red trees that do not so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named for these trees ; it is called The Cedars , and Family members speak of it as a person . " The Cedars has a heart for the poor , " they like to say . By " poor " they mean not the thousands of literal poor living barely a mile away but rather the poor in spirit , for theirs is the kingdom : the senators , generals , and prime ministers who coast to the end of Twenty-fourth Street in Arlington in black limousines and town cars and hulking S.U.V. 's to meet one another , to meet Jesus , to pay homage to the god of The Cedars . There they forge " relationships " beyond the din of vox populi ( the Family 's leaders consider democracy a manifestation of ungodly pride ) and " throw away religion " in favor of the truths of the Family . Declaring God 's covenant with the Jews broken , the group 's core members call themselves " the new chosen . " The brothers of Ivanwald are the Family 's next generation , its high priests in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ banker acquaintance , a recent Ivanwald alumnus , who had mistaken my interest in Jesus for belief . Sometimes the brothers would ask me why I was there . They knew that I was " half Jewish , " that I was a writer , and that I was from New York City , which most of them considered to be only slightly less wicked than Baghdad or Amsterdam . I told my brothers that I was there to meet Jesus , and I was : the new ruling Jesus , whose ways are secret . t Ivanwald , men learn to be leaders by loving their leaders . " They 're so busy loving us , " a brother once explained to me , " but who 's loving them ? " We were . The brothers each paid $400 per month for room and board , but we were also the caretakers of The Cedars , cleaning its gutters , mowing its lawns , whacking weeds and blowing leaves and sanding . And we were called to serve on Tuesday mornings , when The Cedars hosted a regular prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attorney general . Each week the breakfast brought together a rotating group of ambassadors , businessmen , and American politicians . Three of Ivanwald 's brothers also attended , wearing crisp shirts starched just for the occasion ; one would sit at the table while the other two poured coffee . Photograph // The morning I attended , Charlene , the cook , scrambled up eggs with blue tortillas , Italian sausage , red pepper , and papaya . Three women from Potomac Point , an " Ivanwald for girls " across the road from The Cedars , came to help serve . They wore red lipstick and long skirts ( makeup and " feminine " attire were required ) and had , after several months of cleaning and serving in The Cedars while the brothers worked outside , become quite unimpressed by the high-powered clientele . " Girls do n't sit in on the breakfasts , " one of them told me , though she said that none of them minded because it was " just politics . " The breakfast began with a prayer and a sprinkle of scripture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table . Matthew 11:27 : " No one knows the Son except the Father , and no one knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him . " That morning 's chosen introduced themselves . They were businessmen from Dallas and Oregon , a Chinese Christian dissident , a man who ran an aid group for Tibetan refugees ( the Dalai Lama had been very positive on Jesus at their last meeting , he reported ) . Two ambassadors , from Benin and Rwanda , sat side by side . Rwanda 's representative , Dr. Richard Sezibera , was an intense man who refused to eat his eggs or even any melon . He drank cup after cup of coffee , and his eyes were bloodshot . A man I did n't recognize , whom Charlene identified as a former senator , suggested that negotiators from Rwanda and Congo , trapped in a war that has slain more than 2 million , should stop worrying about who will get the diamonds and the oil and instead focus on who will get Jesus . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ change their hearts , " he said . Sezibera stared , incredulous . Meese chuckled and opened his mouth to speak , but Sezibera interrupted him . " It is not so simple , " the Rwandan said , his voice flat and low . Meese smiled . Everyone in the Family loves rebukes , and here was Rwanda rebuking them . The former senator nodded . Meese murmured , " Yes , " stroking his maroon leather Bible , and the words " Thank you , Jesus " rippled in whispers around the table as I poured Sezibera another cup of coffee . Photograph // The brothers also served at the Family 's fourstory , redbrick Washington town house , a former convent at 133 C Street S.E. complete with stained-glass windows . Eight congressmen  --  including Senator Ensign and seven representatives*-lived there , brothers in Christ just like us , only more powerful . We scrubbed their toilets , hoovered their carpets , polished their silver . The day I worked at C Street I ran into Doug Coe , who was tutoring Todd Tiahrt , a Republican congressman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright , lazy smile , Coe has worked for the Family since 1959 , soon after he graduated from college , and has led it since 1969 . Tiahrt was a short shot glass of a man , two parts flawless hair and one part teeth . He wanted to know the best way " for the Christian to win the race with the Muslim . " The Muslim , he said , has too many babies , white Americans kill too many of theirs . Doug agreed this could be a problem . But he was more concerned that the focus on labels like " Christian " might get in the way of the congressman 's prayers . Religion distracts people from Jesus , Doug said , and allows them to isolate Christ 's will from their work in the world . " People separate it out , " he warned Tiahrt . " Oh , okay , I got religion , that 's private . ' As if Jesus does n't know anything about building highways , or Social Security . We got ta take Jesus out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do that ? " Tiahrt asked . " A covenant , " Doug answered . The congressman half-smiled , as if caught between confessing his ignorance and pretending he knew what Doug was talking about . " Like the Mafia , " Doug clarified . " Look at the strength of their bonds . " He made a fist and held it before Tiahrt 's face . Tiahrt nodded , squinting . " See , for them it 's honor , " Doug said . " For us , it 's Jesus . " Coe listed other men who had changed the world through the strength of the covenants they had forged with their " brothers " : " Look at Hitler , " he said . " Lenin , Ho Chi Minh , Bin Laden . " The Family , of course , possessed a weapon those leaders lacked : the " total Jesus " of a brotherhood in Christ . " That 's what you get with a covenant , " said Coe . " Jesus plus nothing . " o the Family , Jesus is not just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " An awesome guy , " a Family employee named Terry told the brothers over breakfast one morning . " He excelled in every activity . He was a great teacher , sure , but he was also a real guy 's guy . He would have made an excellent athlete . " On my first day at Ivanwald , on an uneven court behind the house , I learned to play a two  --  ball variant of basketball called " bump " that was designed to sharpen both body and soul . In bump , players compete at free throws , each vying to sink his own before the man behind him sinks his . If he hits first then you 're out , with one exception : the basket 's net narrows at the chute so that the ball sometimes sticks , at which point another player can hurl his ball up from beneath , knocking the first ball out . In this event everyone cries " Bu-u-ump , " with great joy . Bengt began it . He was one of the house 's leaders , a twenty-four-year-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud , disarming laugh that made him sound like a donkey . From inside the house , waiting for a phone call , he opened a second-floor window and called to Gannon for a ball . Gannon , the son of a Texas oilman , worked as a Senate aide* ; he had blond hair and a chin like a plow , and he sang in a choir . He tossed one up , which Bengt caught and dispatched toward the basket . " Nice , " Gannon drawled as the ball sank through . As soon as the ball bounced off the rim , Beau was at the free-throw line , taking his shot . Beau was a good-natured Atlantan with the build of a wrestler ; as a bumper he was second only to Bengt . " It 's okay if you bump into the other guys , too , " Gannon told me as my turn approached . " The idea 's kinda to get that tension building . " Ahead of me Beau bent his knees to take another shot . The moment the ball rolled off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and hurled his own ball over Beau 's head . As he returned to earth , his elbow descended on Beau 's shoulder like a hammer . " Bump that , " he said . Bump was designed to bring out your hostilities . The Family believes that you ca n't grow in Jesus unless you " face your anger , " and then abandon it . When bump worked right , each man was supposed to lose himself , forgetting even the precepts of the game . Sometimes you wanted to get the ball in , sometimes you wanted to knock it out . In , out , it did n't matter . Your ball , his , who cared ? Bump was n't horseplay , it was a physicalized theology . It was to basketball what the New Testament is to the Old : stripped down to one simple story that always ends the same . Bump , Jesus . Bump , Jesus . I stepped to the line and , after missing , moved in for a layup . Wayne jumped to the line and shot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His ball , meant to hit mine , slammed into my forehead . Bu-u-ump ! the boys hollered . They had bumped me with Christ . Bengt bumped . Beau bumped . Gannon bumped . I was out of contention . Gannon joined me , then Beau . The game was down to Bengt and Wayne . When Wayne threw from behind Bengt , he hurled the ball with such force that it sent Bengt chasing his ball into the neighboring yard . " Tenacious Wayne ! " Gannon roared . Wayne scooped up his own ball , leapt , and slam-dunked Bengt out . " That 's yo motha ! " he hollered . Trotting back to the court , Bengt shook his head . " You the man , Wayne , " he said . " Just keep it calm . " Wayne was ready to burst . " Huddle up guys , " said Bengt . We formed a circle , arms wrapped around shoulders . " Okay , " he said . " We 're gon na pray now . Lord , I just want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellowship in bump and for blessing this fine day with a visit from our new friend Jeff . Lord , we thank you for bringing this brother to us from up north , because we know he can learn to bump , and just-love you , and serve you and Lord , let us all just-Lord , be together in your name . Amen . " he regimen was so precise it was relaxing : no swearing , no drinking , no sex , no self . Watch out for magazines and do n't waste time on newspapers and never watch TV . Eat meat , study the Gospels , play basketball : God loves a man who can sink a three-pointer . Pray to be broken . 0 Heavenly Father . Dear Jesus . Help me be humble . Let me do Your will . Every morning began with a prayer , some days with outsiders-Wednesdays led by a former Ivanwald brother , now a businessman ; Thursdays led by another executive who used tales of high finance to illuminate our lessons from scripture , which he supplemented with xeroxed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women of Potomac Point . But most days it was just us boys , bleary-eyed , gulping coffee and sugared cereal as Bengt and Jeff Connolly , Bengt 's childhood friend and our other house leader , laid out lines of Holy Word across the table like strategy . The dining room had once been a deck , but the boys had walled it in and roofed it over and unrolled a red Persian carpet , transforming the room into a sort of monastic meeting place , with two long tables end to end , ringed by a dozen chairs and two benches . The first day I visited Ivanwald , Bengt cleared a space for me at the head of the table and sat to my right . Beside him , Wayne slumped in his chair , his eyes hidden by a cowboy hat . Across from him sat Beau , still wearing the boxers and T-shirt he 'd slept in . Bengt alone looked sharp , his hair combed , golf shirt tucked tightly into pleated chinos . Bengt told Gannon to read our text for that morning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have searched me and you know me . " ' The very first line made Bengt smile ; this was , in his view , an awesome thing for God to have done . Bengt 's manners and naive charm preceded him in every encounter . When you told him a story he would respond , " Golf-y ! " just to be nice . When genuinely surprised he would exclaim , " Good ni-fight ! " Sometimes it was hard to remember that he was a self-professed revolutionary . He asked Gannon to keep reading , and then leaned back and listened . " Where can I go from your Spirit ? Where can I flee from your presence ? If I go up to the heavens , you are there ; if I make my bed in the depths , you are there . " ' Bengt raised a hand . " That 's great , dude . Let 's talk about that . " The room fell silent as Bengt stared into his Bible , running his finger up and down the gilded edge of the page . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that make you feel ? " " Known , " said Gannon , almost in a whisper . Bengt nodded . He was looking for something else , but he did n't know where it was . " What does it make you think of ? " " Jesus ? " said Beau . Bengt stroked his chin . " Yeah ... Let me read you a little more . " He read in a monotone , accelerating as he went , as if he could persuade us through a sheer heap of words . " For you created my inmost being ; you knit me together in my mother 's womb , " ' he concluded . His lips curled into a half smile . " Man ! I mean , that 's intense , right ? ' In my mother 's womb ' ' - God 's right in there with you . " He grinned . " It 's like , " he said , " it 's like , you ca n't run . Does n't matter where you turn , " cause Jesus is gon na be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes cleared and Gannon nodded . " Yeah , brother , " Bengt said , an eyebrow arched . " Jesus is smart . He 's gon na get you . " Gannon shook his head . " Oh , he 's already got me . " " Me , too , " Beau chimed , and then each man clasped his hands into one fist and pressed it against his forehead or his chin and prayed , eyes closed and Jesus all over his skin . e prayed to be " nothing . " We were there to " soften our hearts to authority . " We instituted a rule that every man must wipe the toilet bowl after he pisses , not for cleanliness but to crush his " inner rebel . " Jeff C. did so by abstaining from " shady " R-rated movies , lest they provoke dreams of women . He was built like a leprechaun , with curly , dark blond hair and freckles and a brilliant smile . The Potomac Point girls brought him cookies ; the wives of the Family 's older men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys went on a swing-dancing date with the Potomac Pointers , more worldly women flocked to Jeff C. , begging to be dipped and twirled . The feeling was not mutual . " I just do n't like girls as much as guys , " he told me one day while we painted a new coat of " Gettysburg Gray " onto Ivanwald . He was speaking not of sex or of romance but of brotherhood . " I like " - he paused , his brush suspended midstroke- " competence . " He ran nearly every day , often alone , down by the Potomac . On the basketball court anger sometimes overcame him : " Shoot the ball ! " he would snap at Rogelio , a shy eighteen-year-old from Paraguay , one of several international brothers . But later Jeff C. would turn his lapse into a lesson , citing scripture , a verse we were to memorize or else be banished , by Jeff C. himself , to a night in the basement . Ephesians , chapter 4 , verses 26-27 : " In your anger do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down while you are still angry , and do not give the devil a foothold . " Jeff C. 's pride surfaced in unexpected ways . Once , together in the kitchen after lunch , I mentioned that I 'd seen the soul singer Al Green live . Jeff C. did n't answer . Instead he disappeared , reemerged with a Green CD , and set it in the boom box . He pressed PLAY , and cracked his knuckles and his neck bones . His hands batted into fists , his eyes widened , and his torso became a jumping bean as his chest popped out on the downbeat . He heard me laughing , applauding , but he did n't stop . He started singing along with the Reverend . He grabbed his crotch and wrenched his shirt up and ran his hand over his stomach . Then he froze and dropped back to his ordinary voice as if narrating . " I used to work in this pizza parlor , " he said . " It was , like , a buncha ... I du n no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , they loved Al Green . We had a poster of him . He was , he was ... man ! Shirtless , leather pants . Low leather pants . " Jeff C. tugged his waistband down . " Hips cocked . " He shook his head and howled . Moonwalking away , he snapped his knees together , his feet spread wide , his hands in the air , testifying . Jeff C. figured I had a thing against South  --  erners . Once , he asked if I thought the South was " racist . " I got it , I tried to tell him , I knew the North was just as bad , but he would n't listen . He told me I could call him a redneck or a hillbilly ( I never called him either ) , but the truth was that he was " blacker " than me . He told me of his deep love for black gospel churches . Loving black people , he told me , made him a better follower of Christ . " Remember that story Cal Thomas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columnist , had recently stopped by Ivanwald for a mixer with young congressional staffers . He had regaled his audience with stories about tweaking his liberal colleagues , in particular about when he had addressed a conference of nonbelievers by asking if anyone knew where to buy a good " negro . " Jeff C. thought it was hilarious but also profound . What Thomas had meant , he told me , was that absent the teachings of Jesus there was no reason for the strong not to enslave the weak . wo weeks into my stay , David Coe , Doug 's son and the presumptive heir to leadership of the Family , dropped by the house . My brothers and I assembled in the living room , where David had draped his tall frame over a burgundy leather recliner like a frat boy , one leg hanging over a padded arm . " You guys , " David said , " are here to learn how to rule the world . " He was in his late forties , with dark , gray-flecked hair , an olive complexion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat around him in a rough circle , on couches and chairs , as the afternoon light slanted through the wooden blinds onto walls adorned with foxhunting lithographs and a giant tapestry of the Last Supper . Rafael , a wealthy Ecuadoran who 'd been a college soccer star before coming to Ivanwald , had a hard time with English , and he did n't understand what David had said . So he stared , lips parted in puzzlement . David seemed to like that . He stared back , holding Raf 's gaze like it was a pretty thing he 'd found on the ground . " You have very intense eyes , " David said . " Thank you , " Raf mumbled . " Hey , " David said , " let 's talk about the Old Testament . Who would you say are its good guys ? " " David , " Beau volunteered . " King David , " David Coe said . " That 's a good one . David . Hey . What would you say made King David a good guy ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ containable delight . " Faith ? " Beau said . " His faith was so strong ? " " Yeah . " David nodded as if he had n't heard that before . " Hey , you know what 's interesting about King David ? " From the blank stares of the others I could see that they did not . Many did n't even carry a Hebrew Bible , preferring a slim volume of just the New Testament Gospels and Epistles and , from the Old , Psalms . Others had the whole book , but the gold gilt on the pages of the first two thirds remained undisturbed . " King David , " David Coe went on , " liked to do really , really bad things . " He chuckled . " Here 's this guy who slept with another man 's wife-Bathsheba , right ? - and then basically murders her husband . And this guy is one of our heroes . " David shook his head . " I mean , Jiminy Christmas , God likes this guy ! What , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we discovered , was that King David had been " chosen . " To illustrate this point David Coe turned to Beau . " Beau , let 's say I hear you raped three little girls . And now here you are at Ivanwald . What would I think of you , Beau ? " Beau shrank into the cushions . " Probably that I 'm pretty bad ? " " No , Beau . I would n't . Because I 'm not here to judge you . That 's not my job . I 'm here for only one thing . " " Jesus ? " Beau said . David smiled and winked . He walked to the National Geographic map of the world mounted on the wall . " You guys know about Genghis Khan he asked . " Genghis was a man with a vision . He conquered " - David stood on the couch under the map , tracing , with his hand , half the northern hemisphere- " nearly everything . He devastated nearly everything . His enemies ? He beheaded them . " David swiped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dop , dop . " David explained that when Genghis entered a defeated city he would call in the local headman and have him stuffed into a crate . Over the crate would be spread a tablecloth , and on the tablecloth would be spread a wonderful meal . " And then , while the man suffocated , Genghis ate , and he did n't even hear the man 's screams . " David still stood on the couch , a finger in the air . " Do you know what that means ? " He was thinking of Christ 's parable of the wineskins . " You ca n't pour new into old , " David said , returning to his chair . " We elect our leaders . Jesus elects his . " He reached over and squeezed the arm of a brother . " Is n't that great ? " David said . " That 's the way everything in life happens . If you 're a person known to be around Jesus , you can go and do anything . And that 's who you guys @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only going to know the value of Jesus , you 're going to know the people who rule the world . It 's about vision .

Because I become a warning . We become a warning . We warn everybody that the future king is coming . Not just of this country or that , but of the world . " Then he pointed at the map , toward the Khan 's vast , reclaimable empire . one night I asked josh , a brother from Atlanta who was hoping to do mission work overseas , if I could look at some materials the Family had given him .

The mafia operates like this , and the basic unit of the Marine Corps is the four man squad . Hitler , Lenin , and many others understood the power of a small core of people . " Another document , " Thoughts and Principles of the Family , " sets forth political guidelines , such as 21 . We recognize the place and responsibility of national secular leaders in the work of advancing His kingdom . 23 .

When the group is ready , " Thoughts on a Core Group " explains , it can set to work : After being together for a while , in this closer relationship , God will give you more insight into your own geographical area and your sphere of influence-make your opportunities a matter of prayer . ...

The word " Jesus " is unmentioned in the brochure . But " Youth Corps Vision , " which is intended only for members of the Family ( " it 's kinda secret , " Josh cautioned me ) , is more direct . The Vision is to mobilize thousands of young people world wide-committed to principle precepts , and person of Jesus Christ .... A group of highly dedicated individuals who are united together having a total commitment to use their lives to daily seek to mature into people who talk like Jesus , act like Jesus , think like Jesus .

Youth Corps is , in many respects , a more aggressive version of Young Life , a better-known network of Christian youth groups that entice teenagers with parties and sports , and only later work Jesus into the equation . Most of my American brothers at Ivanwald had been among Young Life 's elite , and many had returned to Young Life during their college summers to work as counselors . Youth Corps , whose programs are often centered around Ivanwald-style houses , prepares the best of its recruits for positions of power in business and government abroad . The goal : " Two hundred national and international world leaders bound together relationally by a mutual love for God and the family . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes-decades of the Family 's letters , sermons , minutes , Christmas cards , travel itineraries , and lists of members  --  to an archive at the Billy Graham Center of Wheaton College in Illinois . Until I visited last fall , the archive had gone largely unexamined . The Family was founded in April 1935 by Abraham Vereide , a Norwegian immigrant who made his living as a traveling preacher . One night , while lying in bed fretting about socialists , Wobblies , and a Swedish Communist who , he was sure , planned to bring Seattle under the control of Moscow , Vereide received a visitation : a voice , and a light in the dark , bright and blinding . The next day he met a friend , a wealthy businessman and former major , and the two men agreed upon a spiritual plan . They enlisted nineteen business executives in a weekly breakfast meeting and together they prayed , convinced that Jesus alone could redeem Seattle and crush the radical unions . They wanted to give Jesus a vessel , and so they asked God to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a city councilman named Arthur Langlie , stood and said , " I am ready to let God use me . " Langlie was made first mayor and later governor , backed in both campaigns by money and muscle from his prayer-breakfast friends , whose number had rapidly multiplied. * Vereide and his new brothers spread out across the Northwest in chauffeured vehicles ( a $20,000 Dusenburg carried brothers on one mission , he boasted ) . " Men , " wrote Vereide , " thus quickened . " Prayer breakfast groups were formed in dozens of cities , from San Francisco to Philadelphia . There were already enough men ministering to the down-and-out , Vereide had decided ; his mission field would be men with the means to seize the world for God . Vereide called his potential flock of the rich and powerful , those in need only of the " real " Jesus , the " upand-out . " Vereide arrived in Washington , D.C. , on September 6 , 1941 , as the guest of a man referred to only as " Colonel Brindley . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife , Mattie , who remained in Seattle . " In a day or two-many will know that I am in town and by God 's grace it will hum . " Within weeks he had held his first D.C. prayer meeting , attended by more than a hundred congressmen . By 1943 , now living in a suite at Colonel Brindley 's University Club , Vereide was an insider . " My what a full and busy day ! " he wrote to Mattie on January 22 . The Vice President brought me to the Capitol and counseled with me regarding the programs and plans , and then introduced me to Senator Ralph Owen Brewster , who in turn to Senator Harold Hitz Burton-then planned further the program of a prayer breakfast and enlisted their cooperation . Then to the Supreme Court for visits with some of them .. . then back to the Senate , House .... The hand of the Lord is upon me . He is leading . By the end of the war , nearly a third of U.S. senators attended one of his weekly prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called " the new world order . " " Upon the termination of the war there will be many men available to carry on , " Vereide wrote in a letter to his wife . " Now the ground-work must be laid and our leadership brought to face God in humility , prayer and obedience . " He began organizing prayer meetings for delegates to the United Nations , at which he would instruct them in God 's plan for rebuilding from the wreckage of the war . Donald Stone , a high-ranking administrator of the Marshall Plan , joined the directorship of Vereide 's organization . In an undated letter , he wrote Vereide that he would " soon begin a tour around the world for the Marshall Plan , combining with this a spiritual mission . " In 1946 , Vereide , too , toured the world , traveling with letters of introduction from a half dozen senators and representatives , and from Paul G. Hoffman , the director of the Marshall Plan . He traveled also with a mandate from General John Hildring , assistant secretary of state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germans of " the predictable type " ( many of whom , Vereide believed , were being held for having " the faintest connection " with the Nazi regime ) , who could be released from prison " to be used , according to their ability in the tremendous task of reconstruction . " Vereide met with Jewish survivors and listened to their stories , but he nevertheless considered ex  --  Nazis well suited for the demands of " strong " government , so long as they were willing to worship Christ as they had Hitler . In 1955 , Senator Frank Carlson , a close adviser to Eisenhower and an even closer associate of Vereide 's , convened a meeting at which he declared the Family 's mission to be a " worldwide spiritual offensive , " in which common cause would be made with anyone opposed to the Soviet Union . That same year , the Family financed an anti-Communist propaganda film , Militant Liberty , for use by the Defense Department in influencing opinion abroad . By the Kennedy era , the spiritual offensive had fronts on every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the 1980s ) . In 1961 , Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia deeded the Family a prime parcel in downtown Addis Ababa to serve as an African headquarters , and by then the Family also had powerful friends in South Africa , Nigeria , and Kenya . Back home , Senator Strom Thurmond prepared several reports for Vereide concerning the Senate 's deliberations . Former president Eisenhower , Doug Coe would later claim at a private meeting of politicians , once pledged secret operatives to aid the Family 's operations . Even in Franco 's Spain , Vereide once boasted at a prayer breakfast in 1965 , " there are secret cells such as the American Embassy and ) the Standard Oil office that allow us to move practically anywhere . " By the late sixties , Vereide 's speeches to local prayer breakfast groups had become minor news events , and Family members ' travels on behalf of Christ had attracted growing press attention . Vereide began to worry that the movement he had spent his life building might become just another political party . In 1966 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at age eighty-four , Vereide wrote a letter declaring it time to " submerge the institutional image of the Family . " No longer would the Family recruit its powerful members in public , nor recruit so many . " There has always been one man , " wrote Vereide , " or a small core who have caught the vision for their country and become aware of what a leadership led by God ' could mean spiritually to the nation and to the world .... It is these men , banded together , who can accomplish the vision God gave me years ago . " wo weeks into my stay , Bengt announced to the brothers that he was applying to graduate school . He had chosen a university close enough to commute from the house , with a classics program he hoped would complement ( maybe even renew , he told me privately ) his relationship with Christ . After dinner every night he would disappear into the little office beside his upstairs bunk room to compose his statement of purpose on the house 's one working computer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essay to read . We sat down in Ivanwald 's " office , " a room barely big enough for the two of us . We crossed our legs in opposite directions so as not to knock knees . My formal education has been a progression from confusion and despair to hope , the essay began . Its story hewed to the familiar fundamentalist routine of lost and found : every man and woman a sinner , fallen but nonetheless redeemed . And yet Bengt 's sins were not of the flesh but of the mind . In college he had abandoned his boyhood ambition of becoming a doctor to study philosophy : Nietzsche , Kierkegaard , Hegel . Raised in the faith , his ideas about God crumbled before the disciplined rage of the philosophers . " I cut and ran , " he told me . To Africa , where by day he worked on ships and in clinics , and by night read Dostoevsky and the Bible , its darkest and most seductive passages : Lamentations , Job , the Song of Songs . These authors were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a companion . I looked up . " A double , " I said , remembering Dostoevsky 's alter egos . Bengt nodded . " You know how you can stare at something for a long time and not see it the way it really is ? That 's what scripture had been to me . " Through Dostoevsky he began to see the Old Testament for what it is : relentless in its horror , its God a fire , a whirlwind , a " bear , lying in wait , " " a lion in secret places . " Even worse is its Man : a rapist , a murderer , a wretched thief , a fool . " But , " said Bengt , " that 's not how it ends . " Bengt meant Jesus . I thought of the end of The Brothers Karamazov : the saintly Alyosha , leading a pack of boys away from a funeral to feast on pancakes , everyone clapping hands and proclaiming eternal brotherhood . In Africa , Bengt had seen people who were diseased , starving , trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Bengt recalled listening to a group of starving men play the drums . " Doubt , " he said , " is just a prelude to joy . " I had heard this before from mainstream Christians , but I suspected Bengt meant it differently . A line in Dostoevsky 's The Possessed reminded me of him : when the conservative nationalist Shatov asks Stavrogin , the cold-hearted radical , " Was n't it you who said that even if it was proved to you mathematically that the Truth was outside Christ , you would prefer to remain with Christ outside the Truth ? " Stavrogin , who refuses to be cornered , denies it . " Exactly , " Bengt said . In Africa he had seen the trappings of Christianity fall away . All that remained was Christ . " You ca n't argue with absolute power . " I put the essay down . Bengt nudged it back into my hands . " I want to know what you think of my ending . " As I have read more about Jesus , it ran , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people . He was fascinated in particular by an encounter in the Gospel of John , chapter 1 , verse 35-39 , in which Jesus asks two men why they are following him . In turn , the men ask where Jesus is staying , to which he replies , " Come and see . " I am not sure how Jesus asks the question , Bengt had concluded , but from the response , it seems like he is asking , " What do you desire ? " " That 's what it 's about , " Bengt said . " Desire . " He shifted in his chair . " Think about it : What do you desire ? " ' " God ? " " Yes . " " That 's the answer ? " I asked . " He 's the question , " Bengt retorted , half-smiling , satisfied with his inversion by which doubt became the essence of a dogma . God was just what Bengt desired Him to be , even as Bengt was , in the face of God , " nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did Bengt and the Family reject the label " Christian . " Their faith and their practice seemed closer to a perverted sort of Buddhism , their God outside " the truth , " their Christ everywhere and nowhere at once , His commands phrased as questions , His will as simple to divine as one 's own desires . And what the Family desired , from Abraham Vereide to Doug Coe to Bengt , was power , worldly power , with which Christ 's kingdom can be built , cell by cell . of long after our conversation , Bengt put a bucket beside the toilet in the downstairs bunk room . From now on , he announced , all personal items left in the living room would go into the bucket . " If you 're missing anything , guys , " Bengt said over dinner , " look in the bucket . " I looked in the bucket . Here 's what I found : One pair of flip-flops . One pocket-sized edition of the sayings of Jesus . One Frisbee . One copy of Executive Orders , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well worn , beautifully printed on onion skin , given to Bengt Carlson by Palmer Carlson . One pair of dirty underwear . When I picked up the Bible the pages flipped open to the Gospel of John , and my eyes fell on a single underlined phrase , chapter 15 , verse 3 : " You are already clean . " Whenever a sufficiently large crop of God 's soldiers was bunked up at Ivanwald , Doug Coe made a point of stopping by for dinner . Doug was , in spirit , Christ 's closest disciple , the master bumper ; the brothers viewed his visit as far more important than that of any senator or prime minister . The night he joined us he wore a crisply pressed golf shirt and dark slacks , and his skin was well tanned . He brought a guest with him , an Albanian politician whose pale face and ill-fitting gray suit made Doug seem all the more radiant . In his early seventies , Doug could have passed for fifty : his hair was dark , his cheeks taut . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Doug asked Rogelio , " are you from , in Paraguay ? " " Asuncion , " he said . Doug smiled . " I 've visited there many times . " He chewed for a while . " Asuncion . A Latin leader was assassinated there twenty years ago . A Nicaraguan . Does anybody know who it was ? " I waited for someone to speak , but no one did . " Somoza , " I said . The dictator overthrown by the Sandinistas . " Somoza , " Doug said , his eyes sweeping back to me . " An interesting man . " Doug stared . I stared back . " I liked to visit him , " Doug said . " A very bad man , behind his machine guns . " He smiled like he was going to laugh , but instead he moved his fork to his mouth . " And yet , " he said , a bite poised at the tip of his tongue , " he had a heart for the poor . " Doug stared . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . But the question was n't for me . It was n't for anyone . Doug was preparing a parable . There was a man he knew , he said , who did n't really believe in prayer . So Doug made him a bet . If this man would choose something and pray for it for forty-five days , every day , he wagered God would make it so . It did n't matter whether the man believed . It would n't have mattered whether he was a Christian . All that mattered was the fact of prayer . Every day . Forty-five days . He could n't lose , Doug told the man . If Jesus did n't answer his prayers , Doug would pay him $500 . " What should I pray for ? " the man asked . " What do you think God would like you to pray for ? " Doug asked him . " I do n't know , " said the man . " How about Africa ? " " Good , " said Doug . " Pick a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because it was the only one he could remember . " Fine , " Doug told him . " Every day , for fortyfive days , pray for Uganda . God please help Uganda . God please help Uganda . " On the thirty-second day , Doug told us , this man met a woman from Uganda . She worked with orphans . Come visit , she told the man , and so he did , that very weekend . And when he came home , he raised a million dollars in donated medicine for the orphans . " So you see , " Doug told him , " God answered your prayers . You owe me $500 . " There was more . After the man had returned to the United States , the president of Uganda called the man at his home and said , " I am making a new government . Will you help me make some decisions ? " " So , " Doug told us , " my friend said to the president , Why do n't you come and pray with me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ congressmen-who I like to pray with , and they 'd like to pray with you . ' And that president came to The Cedars , and he met Jesus . And his name is Yoweri Museveni , and he is now the president of all the presidents in Africa . And he is a good friend of the Family . " " That 's awesome , " Beau said . " Yes , " Doug said , " it 's good to have friends . Do you know what a difference a friend can make ? A friend you can agree with ? " He smiled . " Two or three agree , and they pray ? They can do anything . Agree . Agreement . What 's that mean ? " Doug looked at me . " You 're a writer . What does that mean ? " I remembered Paul 's letter to the Philippians , which we had begun to memorize . Fulfill ye my joy , that ye be likeminded . " Unity , " I said . " Agreement means unity . " Doug did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Total unity . Two , or three , become one . Do you know , " he asked , " that there 's another word for that ? " No one spoke . " It 's called a covenant . Two , or three , agree ? They can do anything . A covenant is ... powerful . Can you think of anyone who made a covenant with his friends ? " We all knew the answer to this , having heard his name invoked numerous times in this context . Andrew from Australia , sitting beside Doug , cleared his throat : " Hitler . " " Yes , " Doug said . " Yes , Hitler made a covenant . The Mafia makes a covenant . It is such a very powerful thing . Two , or three , agree . " He took another bite from his plate , planted his fork on its tines . " Well , guys , " he said , " I got ta go . " As Doug Coe left , my brothers " hearts were beating hard : for the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . We stood to clear our dishes . On one of my last nights at Ivanwald , the neighborhood boys asked my brothers and me to play . There were roughly six boys , ranging in age from maybe seven to eleven , all junior members of the Family . They wanted to play flashlight tag . It was balmy , and the streetlight glittered against the blacktop , and hiding places beckoned from behind trees and in bushes . One of the boys began counting , and my brothers , big and small , scattered . I lay flat on a hillside . From there I could track movement in the shadows and smell the mint leaves planted in the garden . A figure approached and I sprang up and ran , down the sidewalk and up through the garden , over a wall that my pursuer , a small boy , had trouble climbing . But once he was over he kept charging , and just as I was about to vanish into the trees his flashlight caught me . " Jeff I see you you 're It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he kept the beam on me . Blinded , I could hear only the slap of his sneakers as he ran across the driveway toward me . " Okay , dude , " he whispered , and turned off the flashlight . I recognized him as little Stevie , whose drawing of a machine gun we had posted in our bunk room . He handed the flashlight to me , spun around , started to run , then stopped and looked over his shoulder . " You 're It now , " he whispered , and disappeared into the dark .
