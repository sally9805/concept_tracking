<p> HOW does The New York Times go about fitting " All the News That 's Fit to Print " into the paper ? <p> The Times has held its annual allocation of space devoted to journalism steady for several years , at a level that appears to reflect a balancing of cost considerations and how much time readers have to consume news . The paper hews to no set ratio of news to advertising space . Whether ads dwindle or grow , the so-called news hole remains roughly the same . <p> John Geddes is a managing editor who keeps a tight rein on the space budget , as it 's known in the newsroom . How space is juggled to stay within the annual allocation can influence how much coverage readers get on topics ranging from Hurricane Katrina to weddings . Here are edited excerpts of our recent discussion of the process . BYRON CALAME <p> Public Editor : How does The Times decide how much space to devote to news in the weekday paper ? <p> Mr. Geddes : Naturally it depends on what happens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into two . The feature sections have standing quotas  --  a standing space allotment . The hard news sections , roughly the A Section , Metro , Biz Day Business Day and Sports , have space allotments they begin each day with . These vary from 14 columns up to 75 to 80 columns , depending on the section . <p> Starting from that , we either add or subtract , based on what news has happened . Every day we have a notional six columns , about a page of space , that we can apportion based on need among the hard news sections . <p> Q. What about the planning for the whole year ? <p> A. We do n't look at space and measure ourselves as having failed or succeeded on any metric other than our budget for the year . Over the course of the year , with the ebbs and flows of news , with ups and downs and seasonality , our goal is to wind up at the end of a year within our overall budget . And we did last year . <p> Q. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of columns devoted to news on weekdays over all of last year ? <p> A. On Monday through Saturday , depending on the day of the week , we give our readers between 200 and 325 columns of journalism , stock quotes and service items like the weather and television listings . In the Sunday paper , we run from 700 to 775 columns . <p> Q. What about the four basic news sections ? <p> A. The four sections  --  on , say , a Wednesday  --  run about 200 columns . That does n't include things like the 12 columns for the Editorial page , because that 's not within our news budget . <p> Q. How would that compare to a Wednesday five years ago ? <p> A. About the same . There has been no increase or decrease , except for a contraction in stock tables , in the years I 've been putting together the news sections of the paper . <p> Q. What would cause the news hole budget for 2007 , once you get closer to it , to be raised ? <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fact that it has n't changed in eight years or so is n't just a matter of economics . It is also a matter of what space we think we need to meet the readers ' requirements for presenting the news we think the reader needs on a given day . Would some reporters like to have more space to write their stories ? Probably . Do we think that 's a service to the readers ? In most cases , probably not . <p> Q. How much of an idea can you give us about the amount of news content in a few feature sections  --  the weekly Escapes , for instance ? <p> A. Escapes has about 32 columns , on a Friday . The feature sections vary , but they vary by lesser amounts than the news sections . Those sections can be planned well ahead and do n't have to adjust for breaking news . We 've added some columns to the feature sections , mainly in the arts , and , of course , we began Escapes . But that 's about it . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constrained . <p> Q. Tell us about the Sunday New York Times . How is it different ? <p> A. We have a budget , but we keep that separate from the daily because there are different rhythms to Sunday . The Sunday sections all have a budget . Sunday Styles has about 44 columns . Arts &; Leisure is about 85 columns . <p> Q. Turning to the daily process and the four news sections , what if they feel like something is really special today ? <p> A. The day , in terms of space , begins about 11 o'clock when one of our senior editors goes to each of the individual desks and asks , what do you have ? Do you need any space ? Is there anything of note ? <p> That is brought to me or whoever 's doing space that day at about 11:30 . And we try to pass judgment . Is this meritorious ? How do we stand with our budget ? Do I have five long stories for which space is being requested for tomorrow ? Is that too much for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another day , or is there news that 's forcing this to run right now ? <p> We balance all those things . And then we give that request for space to our colleagues in production . They take the news requirements and the advertising requirements , combine them to make up the whole paper . <p> Q. What if things happen during the evening ? <p> A. We have two options . Until roughly 5 p.m. , we can increase the size of the paper if news happens . That is the tipping point because our pressrooms by then need to plan for the size of the paper . After that , options for increasing the paper are much more limited . <p> Chief Justice Rehnquist died late on a Saturday night . We stopped the press and we pulled out an ad and put in a two-page obit . And then we did other juggling to get in a news story . <p> Q. When editors know a big series like " Class in America " is coming , how do you make room for it ? <p> A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so we can husband the space the class series might need . That we knew about . But , naturally , something like Katrina took us by surprise and demanded a whole lot of space for a number of months . So in the ensuing months , we said , look , this story concerns us all . It concerns Business ; it concerns National ; it concerns Science ; it concerns all of us . <p> We said we 're going to take two columns from each section 's budget and devote it to a generic Katrina pool for the remainder of the year . And so your other news may be a little tighter with the caveat that if news happens , we will respond and give you added space . But on a day-to-day basis , we expect you to keep your stories a little tighter in your sections to bank space to cover Katrina . <p> This is how we 've done it all along . We received no extra space for 9/11 . We received no extra space for the Iraq war . We 're all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game . If something is more important , something else may be a little less important , a little less deserving of space . <p> Q. One subject that is sensitive with a lot of readers is the amount of space devoted to weddings . How do you determine that ? <p> A. Well , there 's seasonality in weddings too . Roughly , over the course of the year , we budget about 12 columns a week for the weddings . That budget , like other things , goes up and down with the seasons . It increases by three to six columns during peak wedding season in the summer . Would all our readers perhaps like all their offspring to be in the wedding announcements ? We 'd like to think so , but like other things in the paper , we have to cover it on the basis of news . What 's the import ? What is the wider world interested in ? And what does this tell us about the world we 're living in ? Newspapering , including space decisions , always includes triage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ normal day ? <p> A. Even on a normal day . Remember , journalism is about telling me what 's important and telling me what 's important in the order of its importance . It 's always a compared-to-what . Something happened on Day One , when nothing 's going on in the world , it may merit one column of coverage . The same thing happening on a very busy day may merit an inch of coverage . <p> It is always a compared-to-what because we 're trying to capture what 's important today in a given space . And we 're trying to relay that to readers using the relative size of the story and the coverage as an indicator of importance . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
