Section : AT WAR How to win the war on Wahhabism <p> To win a war , you must first identify the enemy . In our current war , the enemy 's name is Wahhabism . <p> The Wahhabis , based in Saudi Arabia , are the extremist sect that provides religious support for the horrors inflicted by Osama bin Laden and other Islamic terrorists . Wahhabism emerged in the benighted wastes of Nejd in central Arabia in the middle of the 18th century . Other religions had already experienced bouts of revivalist utopianism , but by the time Wahhabism emerged , these other movements had already been redirected into socially constructive paths : The apocalyptic frenzies that gripped Christendom from the time of St. Francis had been reformulated , through Protestantism , into the intellectual and economic revolutions of the European bourgeoisie . And Judaism had passed through a similar revitalization , embodied in the kabbalistic radicalism of the 17th-century " false messiah " Sabbatai Zevi ; the Sabbataean heresy , too , had been redirected into a modernizing , Enlightenment trend . <p> Wahhabism might at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , after all , became the state faith of the British Empire ; and neo-Sabbataeanism led to the assimilation of Jews into Christian Germany and Poland . Both of these outcomes grew out of geopolitical opportunities-chiefly , the expansion of trade , or what today would be called globalization . Protestantism led the English , and assimilation drove the Jews , to new worlds in every sense , to encounters with realities previously unknown to them . <p> No such opening , however , was available to the shepherds and camel drivers of Nejd . Wahhabism " reformed " and " revived " Islam not by opening to the world , but by turning deeply inward , becoming narrow , rigid , literalistic , and puritanical-before finally exploding into a violent challenge against the Islamic civilization of the Ottomans . The Wahhabis ' anti-Ottomanism resembled the Protestant rebellion against the papacy , and some observers have seen in it an explicit emulation of the Christian Reformation . But then something strange happened to Wahhabism : It leaped far ahead in the process of the politicization of faith to anticipate the coming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stalinism , Japanese militarism , and Hitlerism , there was Wahhabism . It was as if the Arabs of Nejd were so far behind the rest of the world that they were ahead of it . <p> We too often forget that all of the totalitarian threats to the global democratic consensus emerged from nations lagging in their development , and represented attempted short cuts to economic and geopolitical power . Russia , coming late to a modern economy , tried to rush ahead by fabricating the socialist " new man " ; Italy and Germany , slow in their national unification and delayed in the competition for colonies , produced fascism ; Japan , closed to the world until the mid 19th century , launched itself into the brutal subjugation of the Asian mainland . <p> If these countries were handicapped in their modernization , Nejd was apparently retarded beyond remedy , and the Wahhabis did not attempt a serious assault beyond the Arabian peninsula until centuries had passed . But then another strange thing happened : Arabian oil became a key factor in global economics , and-for Wahhabism-an asset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a president of the United States-who also happens to be a follower of David Koresh-and you will have an idea of Wahhabism 's material base . <p> But the Wahhabis ' interests are not economic , and do not involve intervention in the petroleum markets ; they are ideological and religious ( rather than secular and nationalistic ) . Like Nazism , Wahhabism is separatist and supremacist . It argues for a world in which saved , purified Muslims will have no contact with Christians , Jews , and non-Wahhabi Muslim " unbelievers . " Prior to the stabilization of the Saudi regime in the 1930s , Wahhabism-like Italian fascism-drafted the nation 's young men into a militia living in disciplined colonies and drilled in hatred and sadism toward alleged foes . Like Soviet Communism , it recruits cadres worldwide . And like Japanese militarism , it is utterly ruthless . <p> All of these earlier threats had in common their leaders ' conviction of a superiority permitting them to dictate to the whole human race . That is why the West had to destroy Hitlerism : because Hitler made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the rest of Europe , and international law ) . The Italians did the same in despoiling Ethiopia , and the Japanese in massacring millions of Koreans and Chinese . Resisting such forces is the backbone of U.S. foreign policy : It motivated Truman 's stand on Berlin , and Kennedy 's on the Cuban missiles , as well as Reagan 's support for the Nicaraguan contras and , yes , the Afghan mujahedin . <p> It 's true that the war against bin Ladenite terror-that is to say , the anti-Wahhabi war-is no more about Islam per se than the war on Hitler was about Nietzsche , or the Cold War was about socialist economics . But the war on Hitler was fought in Germany , and the Cold War was fought against Communists : The war against terrorism , too , must be fought where the enemy is , and that means the Islamic countries . Wahhabism has declared a war to the death against us , as the Nazis and Communists did . And we must fight Wahhabism to the death , to secure not only our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and civilization . Bin Laden and his Saudi backers threaten to bring the world of Islam crashing down in flames as Hitler did Berlin . But just as we liberated the Germans from Hitler and the Japanese from Tojo , we can liberate the world 's Muslims from bin Laden and his Saudi accomplices . Bombing the Taliban and other extremists will no more destroy Islam than the bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki destroyed Japanese culture . <p> Of course , there is a short-term alternative : containment . The Saudi ruling family , the Sauds , repressed the Wahhabis ' Ikhwan military brotherhood in the 1930s , and-if it were demanded of them-they would probably do it again ; they would cut off funding for such groups worldwide , and more effectively restrict their influence inside Saudi Arabia . But this would be a temporary solution analogous to accepting an imperial Japan after World War II , a Japan in which the militarist generals were deposed but left unpunished . The Sauds repressed the Ikhwan , but later resorted anew to Wahhabism as a geopolitical weapon ; for the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . <p> And the way to get rid of it is to work with the millions of anti-Wahhabi Muslims . Here , too , the analogies with 20th-century totalitarianism offer cause for optimism . Hitler claimed to fight for Europe against the Bolsheviks and the Anglo-American Jewish plutocrats , but Europe did not support him ; most countries produced armed resistance movements against Nazi occupation . The Japanese militarists appealed for Asian support against the Americans in the Philippines , and against the British in Malaya and Burma ; but Japanese occupation turned the Filipinos and Burmese against Tokyo , and when Douglas MacArthur returned to Manila he was hailed as a liberator . In the end MacArthur was also hailed as a liberator in Tokyo , and the Germans turned to Truman , not to some Nazi straggler , to hold the line against the Russians in Berlin . <p> Our task now is comparable to that which faced the World War II generation . We will have to fight Wahhabi terrorism-bin Laden , his Egyptian and Algerian allies , his stooges elsewhere in the Islamic countries , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wahhabized fringe groups like the Taliban and Hezbollah-with the faith and firmness we drew on in beating the Nazis . And as part of that commitment we should directly and actively assist the millions of anti-Wahhabi Muslims . <p> Our action against Wahhabism should begin with a series of ultimatums to the Saudis . The first demand ought to be full and immediate compliance with airline-security , banking , and other antiterrorist measures the Saudis have flouted . The second : the full investigation , arrest , and handing over to the U.S. of all active coconspirators with bin Laden found in Saudi Arabia . The third : an immediate stop to all funding of overseas Wahhabism , including Wahhabi imams and interest groups in the U.S. These three actions would provide more valuable support to our antiterrorist effort than would any direct military assistance . If compliance is not immediate and total , we should freeze all Saudi assets in the U.S. <p> If the world is to be made safe from terrorism , Wahhabism must suffer a definitive , irreversible historic defeat . Liberation , not containment : Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope for the survival of world peace , and of a legitimate , peaceful Islam . <p> By Stephen Schwartz <p> <p> Mr. Schwartz is completing his next book , The Two Faces of Islam . <p>
