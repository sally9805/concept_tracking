Section : Up Front news and opinion from independent minds <p> There is a short item that is now showing up in newspapers across the country that says , " according to an important new survey.devout teens . are better off in emotional health , academic success , community involvement , concern for others , trust of adults and avoidance of risky behavior than their nonreligious counterparts . " <p> That 's a pretty hefty assertion . But it 's downright tepid compared with the following summary of the data by one of this new survey 's authors : <p> on every measure of life outcome.highly religious teens are doing much better than nonreligious kids . . Highly religious American teens are happier and healthier . They are doing better in school , they have more hopeful futures , they get along with their parents better . Name a social outcome that you care about , and the highly religious kids are doing better . <p> If the data actually demonstrate such assertions , it could easily be used to argue that secular parents are profoundly and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them religion , even if these parents do teach their kids sound moral and ethical principles . One could even justify allowing public schools to introduce a substantial amount of religious activity and instruction , not for any specifically religious reasons but simply " in the best interests of the kids . " <p> But what data does the study  --  published as Soul Searching : The Religious and Spiritual Life of American Teenagers  --  actually present on this subject and what conclusions can properly be drawn ? <p> The problem is n't that the study was improperly conducted or that it 's slanted to further a conservative religious political agenda . The survey  --  part of a six-year National Project on Youth and Religion funded by the Lilly Endowment and headquartered at the University of North Carolina , Chapel Hill  --  is a carefully structured combination of a very large telephone survey of 3,290 teenagers ( ages thirteen to seventeen ) conducted over a nine-month period from July 2002 to April 2003 as well as 276 extensive personal interviews . <p> The authors of the study  --  led by Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  are primarily concerned with understanding and combating what they perceive as a deeply disturbing superficiality and self-involved materialism in modern teenagers ' religious outlook . This concern leads them to seriously condemn the corrosive effects of " consumer-driven capitalism " ( their words ) and modern advertising , bringing them at times close to the views of liberal observers of American religion like Alan Wolfe and even Thomas Frank , author of What 's the Matter with Kansas ? To be sure , the Youth and Religion study  --  like the overall six-year project itself  --  is unabashedly aimed at supporting the work of adult church and religious youth group leaders in their ministry with teenagers . But it is n't designed to promote a conservative , crypto-theocratic agenda . <p> But what the Youth and Religion study does reflect is a strongly " theocentric " perspective  --  one that sees religion as central and nonreligion as simply its lack or absence . In setting up the categories for the comparison of religious and nonreligious teenagers , the study defines four basic " ideal types " : the " devoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services weekly , is actively involved in a religious youth group , prays and reads scripture frequently , and feels deep faith and closeness to God  --  and the other three : the " regulars , " the " sporadic , " and the " disengaged , " who are simply defined by the increasing absence of the particular characteristics of the " devoted " group . <p> The result is that the least religious category , the " disengaged , " does n't define a coherent social group of any kind but rather a heterogeneous grab bag of adolescents whose only shared characteristic is that they are n't devout  --  mixing together two kinds of nonreligious adolescents who are really quite distinct . <p> One group is the children of secular parents who accept basic American moral and ethical standards but who do n't believe in a supreme being or attend church . These teenagers ' parents take their kids to soccer practices and youth meetings and themselves attend PTA and neighborhood association meetings but do n't show up at Sunday morning services . When asked , these parents will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ church for the kids ' benefit because they teach many good values over there , but we just felt it was hypocritical to make the kids accept beliefs and doctrines that we do n't really believe or practice ourselves . " These parents may frequently encourage and participate with their kids in civic voluntarism , from after-school tutoring to Habitat for Humanity ; with Meals on Wheels and Hands on America . Over the last thirty years young people from families like these have played a major role in tens of thousands of local and national environmental volunteer projects . <p> The other distinct group of non-devout teenagers is composed of the vast number of " rebellious " teens who actively reject some or even most of mainstream society 's rules , norms , and values . These teenagers come in kaleidoscopic variety  --  gangstas , punks , goths , dopers , dropouts , bikers , slackers , skinheads , losers , ravers , weirdos , cokeheads , junkies , thrill seekers , risk takers , pill poppers , shit kickers , and dozens of other rebellious subcultures of the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basic traits in common : they tend not to be religious , they tend to repeatedly break social rules or even violate the laws , and as a group they tend constantly to get caught , racking up a wildly disproportionate share of all recorded youthful infractions of municipal laws and school regulations . <p> There may be some specific research objectives for which it makes sense to lump these rebellious teens together with the first group into a single catch-all category called the " nonreligious . " However , in a productive national discussion of the differences between religious and nonreligious teenagers , it would seem more logical to consider the two groups separately . But it just does n't happen in the Religion and Youth survey . On variable after variable measuring obedience to rules , compliance with social norms , and general social adjustment  --  variables like the number of arrests and driving tickets , frequency of expulsions , level of sexual activity , use of drugs , quality of self-image , relationship with parents , participation in volunteer activities , level of school grades , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invariably appears inferior to the devout . <p> It may be that the nonrebellious secular group alone might actually score as high or even higher than the religious group on some or all of these measures . But there is n't one piece of data in the entire study that is designed to find out . On the contrary , the study presumes that healthy , productive , nonreligious teenagers and morally responsible secular parents are so scarce in American society that they need n't be considered as a distinct or significant social group . <p> This attitude is most evident in two long personal profiles that are the most vivid and specific portraits the book contains of nonreligious teens . One of the two nonreligious teens portrayed is Raymond , a drug dealer who smokes marijuana , drinks alcohol , uses crystal meth , has withdrawal symptoms , was expelled from high school , has been in jail , and watches porn videos . The teen 's father is " a biker who drinks and sends Raymond soft-porn backgrounds for his computer . " <p> The other nonreligious teenager is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affable adolescent , the kind most adults would enjoy and admire . " But as the profile continues , it emerges that he once attempted suicide and has difficult relations with his parents  --  a mother he describes as " really new-agey , into a lot of weird , crazy things " and a father who is a " hard-ass " who " worked so much I hardly ever saw him . " <p> Despite his extreme lack of parental guidance and support , however , the seventeen-year-old nonreligious teen expresses a wide variety of admirable moral and ethical sentiments . But the interviewer subsequently comments that , " lacking recourse to ground his moral commitments in , say , divine command or natural law , Steve finds himself . possessing few coherent , rational grounds for explaining , justifying and defending those standards .. Of course , nobody expects a 17 year old to be an articulate moral philosopher . But the apparent lack of clear bearings or firm anchors in Steve 's moral reasoning are conspicuous and perhaps worrisome . " <p> These two profiles illustrate an unstated but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in delinquency and social pathology or as basically confused and adrift , lacking clear parental moral guidance and unconsciously yearning for the clarity and certainty religious faith would provide . <p> The authors do warn that the two profiles they offer are n't actually meant to typify all nonreligious adolescents and their parents . But the only broad generalization the book offers about healthy nonreligious teens and their families reflects the same basic view that , " as a whole , low-attending American teens , like the nonreligious teens , appear to reflect some likely signs of family strain and general civic and organizational disconnection . " <p> In fact , in all of the data from the telephone surveys , interviews , and scores of regressions and statistical tables , the social categories of morally responsible nonreligious parents and decent , law-abiding and successful nonreligious teens hover like ghostly , unseen presences . One senses their existence somewhere in the underlying data , but nowhere are their numbers estimated and nowhere can they be directly observed . <p> In a book subtitled The Religious and Spiritual Lives of American Teenagers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't an inconsequential omission . <p> By Andrew Levison <p> <p> Andrew Levison is the author of two books and numerous articles on the social and political attitudes and behavior of blue-collar workers and other ordinary Americans .
