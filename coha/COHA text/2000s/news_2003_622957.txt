<p> When San Mateo County child welfare workers discovered last spring that a 12-day-old baby 's bones had been snapped by abuse , they reacted swiftly and firmly , filing a legal motion that could have allowed them to argue against ever returning the baby to his parents . <p> But , unable to prove who harmed little Angelo Marinda , and with his parents eagerly doing whatever the county asked of them , Children and Family Services caseworkers decided the parents should get another chance . <p> That decision eventually sent baby Angelo to his parents ' home Dec. 24 for a two-night visit , a Christmas gift from the caseworkers that turned tragic . <p> Angelo , police said , was shaken to death . His father has pleaded not guilty to murder . <p> After Angelo died , county officials began poring over hundreds of pages recording his short life and wrote a detailed case chronology from records and interviews with caseworkers . <p> Copies of that report and the normally confidential records of Angelo 's case were released to The Chronicle Thursday under an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the county 's juvenile court . <p> The records provide a detailed glimpse into the workings of San Mateo County 's child welfare system , considered by many to be a model system . <p> THE BEST THEY COULD <p> Stuart Oppenheim , policy director for San Mateo County Children and Family Services , said he believes caseworkers made the best decisions they could . <p> " As the case progressed , with the information people had at the time , they made appropriate professional judgments and decisions and took appropriate professional actions , " he said . " However , looking back on the situation , we 'll be instituting several modifications to the system which we think in good faith any responsible organization would do . " <p> Angelo came to caseworkers ' attention April 29 , just 12 days into his life , when he was admitted to St. Luke 's Hospital . When doctors reported the baby 's ankles had been twisted and snapped , and his ribs crushed by a squeezing motion , county workers ordered Angelo held in the hospital and placed his then-16-month-old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation into a mystery that has never been solved : who hurt baby Angelo . <p> According to the records , at the time of his injury Angelo was living in a Daly City home with his sister , his unmarried parents , his aunt and his paternal grandparents and had just finished a four-day visit with his maternal grandparents in San Francisco . <p> All those people were interviewed by police on May 2 and 3 . All denied harming the baby or having seen anybody harm him before his mother noticed the swollen leg April 29 . <p> As the police investigation proceeded , county officials sought custody under a state law that permits the court in many cases to deny parents reunification , placing the children on a fast track for adoption . <p> CHANGING THEIR MINDS <p> But as time passed without new information about who abused Angelo , and with his parents cooperating cheerfully with the investigation , caseworkers changed their minds . <p> " Due to the seriousness of Angelo 's injuries , reunification services need not be offered , " the caseworkers wrote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although Angelo 's injuries are egregious in degree , ( the department ) will be recommending reunification services , as the parents are receptive to receiving services . " <p> In an effort to preserve families , federal and state laws require that " reasonable " efforts be made to reunite families , experts say , except in extreme cases of abuse . And even when such abuse does happen , courts merely have the right to deny parental rights . They do n't do it automatically . <p> To make their decisions , judges rely on information presented by social workers and lawyers , but can go against recommendations made to them , according to Jill Duerr Berrick , a professor at UC Berkeley 's School of Social Welfare . <p> " The judge has to agree , " she said . " It 's not an automatic thing that a social worker decides on a whim . " <p> In Angelo 's case , the information about the family being provided to the court after caseworkers decided to proceed with reunification was often glowingly positive , especially in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most recent court report , from October , noted that the parents were in full compliance with their court-ordered services , were participating in psychological evaluations , graduating from parenting classes and having regular supervised visits , where they were described as attentive , and their children as laughing and smiling . <p> Angelo quickly recovered from his injuries , according to the report , while his sister  --  described as developmentally delayed from suspected past neglect  --  was receiving regular medical checkups and dental care . <p> In response to the report , the court ordered Angelo 's sister back to her parents and suggested that Angelo also should return home soon , according to the case file . <p> NOT IN REPORTS <p> However , not every worker observation or event in Angelo 's case was included in the reports given to the court . <p> A chronology of the case prepared by the department after Angelo 's death includes some information that Oppenheim said is from caseworkers ' memories that is not found in the reports submitted to the court , in the notes prepared by social workers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reviewed by The Chronicle . <p> Oppenheim said caseworkers do not necessarily record every contact or event in a case . <p> Much of the information recorded in the chronology but missing from the file refers to mundane details of transportation and uneventful visits . But the chronology also includes some warnings against reunification made before Angelo 's death but not recorded elsewhere in the file . <p> For example , according to the chronology , a family care worker who oversaw Angelo 's visits with his parents told Angelo 's social worker the baby had a " look of fear in his eyes " during a Dec. 7 visit . The same caseworker said on Dec. 19 that she had a " feeling " that Angelo should not be left alone with his father , according to the chronology . <p> While those warnings do n't appear in the caseworkers ' notes or court reports written before Angelo died , Oppenheim said the caseworker told him she took them into account before proceeding with the unsupervised visit . <p> FOSTER MOTHER 'S WARNING <p> The chronology also reports that Angelo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return Angelo to his parents , but at another point warned them that " something needed to be done " about the case after she discovered bruises on Angelo following an unsupervised visit in November . <p> Neither comment is recorded in case notes or court reports , although details of the bruising incident , and statements by Angelo 's parents blaming the bruises on an accidental fall , are in the case notes . <p> But the case notes do not include the caseworkers ' conclusion , recorded in the chronology , that Angelo 's parents were not " intentionally abusive " toward the children , although the chronology states the caseworker warned Angelo 's parents that she would recommend the baby be put up for adoption if he were injured once more . <p> According to the chronology , the caseworker and supervisor suspected that other family members were " possible perpetrators " of Angelo 's original abuse , and approached the case " with the understanding that lack of parents ' supervision " was to blame for the bruising incident , according to the chronology . <p> Ultimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discretion to decide whether to move forward with unsupervised visits between Angelo and his parents . <p> After several supervised and unsupervised visits  --  usually lasting less than five hours each  --  the caseworkers decided to approve a two-night visit so Angelo could spend Christmas with his parents , Oppenheim said . The baby died Christmas Day . <p> " We all stand firmly convinced this is a tragedy , " Oppenheim said . " We 're going to do things differently in the future . That does n't mean we 're going to second-guess what was done in the past . " <p> NEW SAFEGUARDS <p> Oppenheim said the decision to recommend reunification services in cases involving severe physical abuse of children under 5  --  currently made by the assigned social worker and supervisor  --  will now also involve a regional manager , the children and family services director and county counsel . <p> The decision to move to unsupervised visits or to send a child home will also involve that expanded team of decisionmakers , Oppenheim said , and the department will no longer ask the court for discretion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . <p> At Diaz 's request , any future court report for a case involving a foster parent will include a written statement from that foster parent , Oppenheim said . <p> And finally , he said , the department will make clear to future caseworkers that Christmas and other holidays shall not be a factor in determining the timing and length of visits . <p> Diaz said she supports these reforms , and more . <p> " These plans are just a beginning in the changes that must continue to occur so that when we remove children from their homes , we remove them to make their lives better , not worse , " she said.E-mail the writers at **25;8469;TOOLONG and **25;8496;TOOLONG
