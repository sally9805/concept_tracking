<p> Thomas Begel badly wants to buy the Cubs , and in his seat behind home plate at Wrigley Field on Monday , he offered a wealthy fan 's sentiment sure to be repeated by other bidders . <p> " How could you not want to own this team ? " he asked on a brisk and overcast opening day when the ivy on the ballpark 's outfield wall was still weeks from blooming . " You 're buying a shrine , a team and a great place to watch baseball . " <p> The Cubs are one of the most iconic teams in sports , with a legacy built on a famous amount of frustration rather than a long run of success . It is 99 years and counting since their last World Series title , but the Cubs remain immensely popular , as does Wrigley , a charming geezer of a ballpark that , at age 93 , is as much an architectural treasure as it is a home to a baseball team . <p> Last season , the Cubs won only 66 games  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fans . In the months leading into this season , the Cubs spent a fortune on free agents , but they are already under .500 , with a 3-5 record that includes losses in Wrigley in Monday and Tuesday . <p> Soon , the Cub critiques may start anew  --  not enough pitching , not enough luck . But Begel , who cheered for the Cubs ' minor league team in his hometown , Peoria , was already prepared with his own analysis Monday . " You need someone to run it as a team to win the World Series , " he said as the game progressed , " not as part of a public corporation that must satisfy shareholders . " <p> The public corporation he was referring to is the Tribune Company , which last week put the team up for sale as part of an $8.2 billion transaction in which it would go private in a deal engineered with the billionaire Samuel Zell . <p> And already , at least four local bidders , including Begel , who runs a private equity group , and Thomas Mandler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its attempt to acquire the Cubs in 1981 , have declared their candidacies . <p> Others are quietly assembling investors to buy a team that is virtually certain to sell for well over $500 million and almost certainly more than the $660 million that was paid in 2002 for the Boston Red Sox , the most ever for a major league team . <p> Jerry Colangelo , the chairman of the Phoenix Suns and the onetime free-spending general partner of the Arizona Diamondbacks , is said to be interested . Mark Cuban , the rambunctious and idiosyncratic Internet billionaire who owns the Dallas Mavericks , said by e-mail that he might be interested in fulfilling the wishes of some Cubs fans for a real hands-on owner . " Maybe , " he wrote , " they have seen me sing ' Take Me Out to the Ball Game ' there , " which he did in 2002 . <p> A local investment banker , John Canning , who is a limited partner in the Milwaukee Brewers , is also said to be considering a bid . <p> " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Sal Galatioto , an investment banker who said he was representing a group that had not publicly declared its intention to vie for the Cubs . " You 'll hear 50 names by the time this is over . If Tribune ca n't get a bidding war going , they should n't sell it . " <p> Even though Tribune did not find a way to get the almost comically cursed Cubs a championship , or even a spot in the World Series , where they have not been since 1945 , the company has provided the team with stability . Tribune paid $20.5 million to acquire the team in 1981 , five months after a group led by Jerry Reinsdorf acquired the White Sox for $20 million . Since then , 27 teams have changed owners , with the Yankees , in their 35th season under George Steinbrenner , now enjoying the status of being the most continuously owned team in the majors . <p> The roster of recent sales includes Arte Moreno 's $182.5 million purchase of the Los Angeles Angels , Mark Attanasio 's $223 million deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquisition of the Los Angeles Dodgers and Ted Lerner 's $450 million deal for the Washington Nationals . The pending sale of the Atlanta Braves to Liberty Media by Time Warner , in a complex transaction that has yet to be approved , is worth $460 million to $470 million . <p> " The last few years ' sales of teams , " said Bob DuPuy , the president of Major League Baseball , " reflect a turnaround in industry cash flow and the facts that clubs are viewed as better investments than ever . " <p> But the Cubs ' sale is poised to tell an even richer story . <p> Mandler 's group , built from a core of the 100 investors who each pledged $250,000 apiece for the Cubs in a more modest era back in 1981 , now requires a minimum personal ante of $1 million to join the bid . <p> " Owning the team would be a lifelong dream , " he said at Monday 's game . " And I want to see a winner in my lifetime . " Like any Cubs fan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losing years and from the particularly maddening ones , like 1969 , when the Cubs squandered a sizable regular-season lead over the Mets ; and 1984 , when the Cubs blew a two-game lead in the best-of-five National League Championship Series ; and 2003 , when the Cubs were five outs from the World Series with a three-run lead and never got there . <p> " It 's been a good life lesson , " he said . " I got married in 1969 . If our marriage could survive the collapse of ' 69 , it could survive anything . " <p> Just then , Richard Baehr , a management consultant who said he owns a tiny stake in the White Sox but is being " noodged " by Mandler to join him , said , " I hear Steve Bartman just joined your group . " <p> Baehr was referring to the Cubs fan who , in the 2003 N.L.C.S. , interfered with a foul ball at Wrigley that Cubs left fielder Moises Alou could have caught . If the ball had ended up in Alou 's glove , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Series with a three-run lead . Instead , the roof fell in on the Cubs , and the team and its fans were left to contemplate one more miserable incident of black magic , along with the black cat at Shea Stadium that appeared to symbolize doom for Leo Durocher 's Cubs in September 1969 , and the hex bestowed in 1945 by the angry owner of a World Series-attending , malodorous goat . <p> The collapses , curses and hexes are as much a part of the Cubs as Wrigley Field , where lights were not introduced until 1988 ; where the brilliance of Ernie Banks and Billy Williams still echoes ; where home runs are caught in the street behind left field ; where the singing of " Take Me Out to the Ball Game " is a major event ; where the bleachers are packed ; and where there are ushers who know your family and are as likely to take snapshots of fans as fans are likely to take pictures of Wrigley 's " friendly confines . " <p> " It 's nothing short of amazing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one attendance record after another in the past quarter century , said John McDonough , the team 's president and former lead marketer . " Last year , I said , ' O.K. , I got it , the ivy is beautiful , the scoreboard is hand-operated , but it 's time to win , ' " he added . <p> During the off-season , amid speculation that Tribune might sell the Cubs , team management turned uncharacteristically aggressive with a nearly $300 million spending spree to sign players like outfielder Alfonso Soriano and pitcher Ted Lilly . <p> " Some of those contracts are back-loaded , which says they 're not spending their money , " said Mandler , a leading indicator to him that Tribune would sell . McDonough denied the spending was tied to any effort to enhance the team 's value . <p> Prospective owners like Mandler and Begel are , for now , in the dark about what they can do beyond solidifying their investment groups . Neither Tribune nor Zell has set a timetable to sell the team , which might not happen for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if Wrigley itself will be sold . Owning one without the other sounds like baseball sacrilege , but a long-term lease with generous terms might alleviate a new owner 's anxiety about cash flow . <p> Still , Begel said that a purchase of the team without the ballpark " makes no sense . " " Without it , there 'd have to be a big reduction in the price , " Mandler said . <p> Mandler and Begel have never met . But Mandler wondered aloud on Monday if Begel would like to merge for a joint bid . Later in the game , Begel thought for a moment , then said somewhat reluctantly , " Give him my number . " ##
