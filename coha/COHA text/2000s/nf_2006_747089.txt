Prejudice and discrimination against lesbian , gay and bisexual students , faculty , and staff on college campuses is an important issue that demands attention . Intolerance for the lesbian , gay and bisexual ( LGB ) community is often intensified by a lack of knowledge and understanding between heterosexuals and the LGB community , a problem that could be solved by successful programming that includes both communities . Research indicates that there are some programs at public universities that seem to be effective in supporting the LGB community , but very few programs exist on religiously affiliated college campuses that address this concern . <p> This qualitative study examines the steps taken by one Roman Catholic university to address this issue . Twenty participants of the " Rainbow Educator " program were asked a series of open-ended questions designed to explore their experiences in the program and to elicit information about any transformative effects the program had on them or the campus community . Three major themes emerged from the data : first , participants reported an increased awareness of social identity ( their own and others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serve as allies to the LGB community , and finally participants described the overall positive impact the program had on the campus community . Problem <p> Scrawled in the men 's room of the Law School library was the following : " A fag with AIDS killed my friend . " A freshman received death threats on her answering machine ; caller said he knew where she lived on campus and would kill her for being a " filthy dyke . " A student returned to his dorm room to discover " God Hates Fags " written in indelible marker on his door . Inside the room was trashed , with clothes , shoes , books , and papers torn and strewn all over the floor . When a freshman " came out " ( announced his same-sex orientation ) , his roommate was so upset that the gay student had to move to a single room on campus . He was harassed to the point that campus security accompanied him to class , the dining hall , and his dorm ( as reported to Public Safety and the Gay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Although they occurred on one campus in southern California , the incidents described above , are not unique to this private catholic university . The scarcity of research in this area , however , makes it difficult to know just how unique this situation is in general , and it is even more difficult to ascertain the level of intolerance at religiously affiliated universities ( RAI 's ) . As Levine and Love ( 2000 ) note , the limited research available on RAI 's suggests that factors such as : the invisibility of the issue of sexual orientation , the lack of a visible community of lesbian , gay and bisexual ( LGB ) people , the ways that institutions traditionally approach issues of sexuality , an institutional culture of avoidance , and finally , the negative messages coming from the sponsoring religious organization , may all contribute to intolerance toward the LGB community . <p> In addition , prejudice and discrimination against LGB students , faculty , and staff is often intensified by a lack of knowledge and understanding between heterosexuals and the LGB community . While there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effective in supporting LGB students , research suggests few programs even exist on religiously affiliated college campuses that address this need ( Evans &; D'Augelli , 1996 ; Levine &; Love , 2000 ; Lipkin , 1999 ; Love , 1998 ) . One possible explanation for the small number of programs at private and public institutions designed to improve relations between the heterosexual and LGB communities may be that student affairs practitioners report lower levels of skill in working with the LGB community as compared to their skill in working with other diverse populations ( Croteau &; Talbot , 2000 ) . While troubling , it appears ( according to Croteau &; Talbot ) that self-reports from student affairs practitioners indicate that their limited skill is at least greater than that of graduate faculty and students . Their research shows that graduate faculty and students in student affairs have overall lower levels of knowledge , skills , and comfort working with sexual minority issues . Thus , the graduate students trained in student affairs programs do not have the requisite knowledge or skills to design , and implement programs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on campus . This situation is indeed troubling , and it highlights the need for successful programming in this area , given the already-limited opportunities that exist for LGB community members to engage with others about sexual orientation and the challenges they encounter on campus . <p> It is also known that student learning and improved understanding is enhanced by the shared wisdom and collaboration of faculty , staff , and administration . In fact , recent research indicates that student learning and personal development are influenced by activities that fall outside of the traditional classroom setting ( Kuh , G. 1998 ; Kellogg , 1999 ) . But this demands a proactive stance and great cooperation among faculty and student affairs professionals on college campuses , who can learn from each other ( Banta &; Kuh , 1998 ) . Thus , this reaffirms the great need for educational programs that fall outside of the traditional classroom , that involve diverse stakeholders and that are organized to promote positive inter-group relations between the LGB community and heterosexuals . <p> This study examines the steps taken by one Roman Catholic university @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ significant change in the relationships between the heterosexual and LGB communities on campus . The efforts taken by this university are particularly remarkable given the stance of the Catholic Church on homosexuality . The strategies employed by this university to craft an effective program that raised awareness and enhanced the capacity of the university 's community members to serve as allies to the LGB community illustrates the possibilities for change at other institutions . <p> First , it is necessary to describe the components of the Rainbow Educator ( RE ) program , and then provide a description of the methodology used for this study . Then , in the next section the results are provided , which demonstrate the positive impact the program had on the 20 members who were part of the Rainbow Educator team , and the university community . This section includes specific examples of participants whose attitudes toward and ability to serve as allies to the LGB community was greatly enhanced by program participation . The paper is concluded with a summary and recommendations for future study . Description of the Rainbow Educator Program <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1993 and 1999 at a private , Roman Catholic , Liberal Arts University in southern California . In response to the incidents , in 1997 the Board of Trustees at the Catholic university passed a policy prohibiting harassment against university students and staff based on sexual orientation . While it did not go further to include lesbians , gay men , and bisexuals in the university 's nondiscrimination policy , this was a significant move on the part of this university . Despite advocating respect for the dignity of the individual in its mission statement , the prevailing climate at that time was invisibility at best and hostility at worst for the LGB community on campus . Faculty and staff feared losing their jobs if they came out , and students risked ostracism , harassment , and violence . ( see Footnote 1 ) <p> In response to these incidents , in 1998 a group of students , staff , and faculty invited members of the campus community to engage with each other in dialogue and cooperation about issues of diversity , and sexual orientation in particular . In cooperation with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Irvine Foundation to fund " Rainbow Visibility , " a comprehensive project that aimed to raise campus awareness about homophobia and to educate the university community on LGB culture and history . Working within the parameters of the university 's mission statement , the goal of Rainbow Visibility ( RV ) was to move the campus community toward inclusion of its own LGB community . <p> One program that was created from this project was called the Rainbow Educator ( RE ) program , which was comprised of a small group ( between twelve and eighteen ) undergraduate and graduate students , staff , faculty , administrators , and alumni/ae who gave presentations and workshops on sexual orientation and other diversity issues . Some RE 's identify themselves as lesbian , gay , or bisexual ; most do not . The most important qualification for an RE is a desire to promote awareness , openness , and sensitivity to multiculturalism at the university . <p> In the first year of the program , 10 RE 's led fifteen programs involving sororities , Counseling Center staff , University Ministry staff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Program , and graduate and undergraduate courses in business , communication studies , leadership , theology and religious studies , sociology , and education . In the second year , 16 RE 's led more than twenty programs with student multicultural organizations , fraternities , sororities , graduate assistants , Student Affairs staff , National Society of Collegiate Scholars chapter , Staff Employees Association , and graduate and undergraduate courses in education , philosophy , counseling , marriage and family therapy , and leadership . <p> Any university affiliated individual or group could request an RE presentation for an on- or off-campus organization , group , or class . Presentations were tailored to the specific needs and learning goals of the requester/requesting group . For example , presentations may focus on one or more of the following : history , culture , stereotypes , religious issues , legal/political issues , coming out , hate crimes , diversity within the LGB community , homophobia , and heterosexism . Presentations were interactive , dynamic , and fun ; they included films , role plays , visualizations , personal stories , and questions-and-answer sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RE presentations . <p> The students , faculty , staff and administrators who were Rainbow Educators made a significant commitment of their time , as the program was comprehensive and required several hours of training . For example , RE 's received 45 hours of training during their first year , which included participation in a weekend retreat on multicultural awareness . Since the work was done at an RAI , the training also emphasized religious issues related to sexual orientation . The aim of the training sessions was to be interactive , thought provoking , and fun ; they are also intended to build trust and effective communication among team members . In addition , RE 's meet to plan upcoming presentations , debrief previous ones , and address questions and/or conflicts as they arose . <p> After a brief presentation of the methodology , included is a discussion of the findings that illustrate the RE program 's several significant outcomes : increased participants ' awareness of social identity , participants ' improved confidence in serving as allies of the LGB community , and the program 's positive impact on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study was a qualitative , exploratory study that investigated in detail the experiences of the RE team members from the first two years of the program , and the impact their program had on the campus community . The research questions that framed this study included : 1 ) How does an educational college program designed to raise awareness and reduce prejudice with respect to issues of sexual orientation , benefit the personal development of those who participate in the program ? 2 ) What can be learned from this program that will make a contribution to the paucity of research on existing programs at religiously affiliated institutions ? 3 ) How does this educational program impact the general university student population ? <p> The RE program has transformed individual lives and contributed to an overall positive change in campus climate toward greater understanding , empathy , and inclusion of not just lesbians , gay men , and bisexuals , but also of other identities and cultures . Their success is instructive for other college campuses that seek to make an impact on the attitudes and behaviors of those who interact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the group of RE 's we interviewed were three faculty members , three administrators , one alumnus , five undergraduate , and eight graduate students . Members identified as male ( 9 ) , female ( 11 ) , heterosexual ( 14 ) , gay ( 5 ) , lesbian ( 1 ) , African- American ( 1 ) , White ( 13 ) , Latina/o ( 4 ) , Asian ( 1 ) , Filipino ( 1 ) , and physically challenged ( 1 ) . <p> All participants were asked a series of open-ended questions designed to explore their experiences as RE 's . All interviews lasted approximately one hour . Each interview was taped and later transcribed , coded , and analyzed using the constant comparative method ( Lincoln &; Guba , 1985 ) . A final manuscript was reviewed and feedback was provided by five study participants . Pseudonyms are used throughout and caution was employed so that participants are not easily identifiable by any cultural characteristics . <p> It should be noted that both researchers were involved in the development and implementation of the original Rainbow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ RE program , at one time or another . As such , we are stakeholders in relation to the outcomes of this study . This has two possible consequences : first , the ongoing relationships we have with the RE 's and the campus community may have enabled greater trust and honesty in the interview process ; and secondly , since our subjects knew we had a stake in the success of the program , they may have withheld information that might be perceived to negatively impact the outcomes . Most of the participants knew we were committed to the creation of a more open climate for the LGB community on campus , and therefore we emphasized to them the value of their perspectives in this research . Therefore , we believe they responded in ways that honestly reflected their experiences . In addition , we have made every attempt to interpret the data in as unbiased a way as possible , and were reflective of our positionality throughout the study . Results <p> In this section we provide evidence of the following three themes that emerged from the interview data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 ) increases awareness of social identity , 2 ) improves the confidence of participants to serve as allies to the LGB community , and 3 ) makes a positive impact on the overall campus community . <p> Increased awareness of social identity <p> A major benefit of participation and collaboration with a diverse group is an increased awareness of one 's own , and others ' , social identity . Throughout the training and during presentation preparations , the RE program provided increased social contact among a diverse group of participants . As Bill Tierney ( 1993 ) has pointed out , we learn about difference by working , living , and learning from others who are different than ourselves . But to understand others , we must first come to know ourselves ; we can do this by examining our identity through the intersections of race , gender , and sexual orientation . The RE program facilitators implemented a variety of team-building exercises and other strategies to facilitate this examination and to increase the participants ' awareness of social identity . In the training program , heterosexism was examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , such as role plays and case studies , to engage participants in purposeful dialogue about their own privilege , or lack thereof . <p> As a result , participants were more able to acknowledge their own privileged status . Harry , a heterosexual white male graduate student , said , " One of the things I really enjoyed about the Rainbow Educator program was that we talked about sexuality and its relationship to ethnicity and gender . In a lot of ways , I was very skeptical of my upbringing as a male and a lot of the  --  sort of  --  programming . " He also grew to recognize his heterosexual privilege , commenting : <p> Yeah , I 'm part of the problem , by not acknowledging that there is a problem , so to speak . That there 's a lot of privileges that I have , and have had , that I never really attributed to my sexual orientation , which could have been because of the fact that I was n't gay . So that was kind of the thing that was most shocking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I grew the most , in realizing that there 's a lot of privilege out there that goes unrecognized , in my own cultural group . <p> The same type of recognition was evident with some of the gay participants . Tim , a gay undergraduate student of color , thought deeply about his privilege as a male as a result of his work and engagement with the other RE 's . He stated : <p> I think a lot of the training that we did made me sensitive . I think bad stuff 's easy to believe about yourself and so you sort of focus on ' Oh , okay , I 'm brown  --  whatever . ' And , ' Woe is me , I 'm working class . ' It was the male piece that I 'd always forget . I think it was one of the things when we were talking about sex that I did n't realize sometimes where my privilege is . And it was helpful to get that  --  I got that through this experience . <p> Inevitably students of color , who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudices and stereotypes , and many of their views are influenced by the values and opinions of their family . Mary , a heterosexual undergraduate student of color , told us : <p> Being able to educate my mother , also , it opened up her eyes as well , like , this is becoming a norm in society now and , you know , you need to learn how to accept it . And it 's happening to a lot more people . It 's not just white people . So that was a big shock to me . <p> Beverly Tatum ( 1992 ) has acknowledged that as people begin to understand discrimination and its ' many manifestations in our society , they begin to recognize its legacy within themselves . The RE program provided opportunities for participants to recognize , acknowledge , and work with their own biases . For example , Latonya , a heterosexual graduate student of color , talked about her journey to understand the connections between discrimination in her community and that in the gay community . She told us a story about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ area of town known for its large gay population and gay-friendly businesses . She said , " I began to realize , this must be how the white folk at home feel , once they realize , okay , these people are n't so bad ; let me go over to that grocery store and just deal . " She further explained : <p> Intolerance is across the board ; you do n't have to be wearing a white sheet to bring forth ignorance that you 've learned . I 'm understanding how there are differences within the gay community , just like in my own community . And just being able to open up like that , I think , has a lot to do with the Rainbow Educators , because I was able to ask those questions that I felt so ashamed to ask before . I think it has really helped me grow . <p> Other participants echoed Latonya 's comments by acknowledging their previously held stereotypes , and they indicated that the RE program helped them to realize how erroneous they were . Jessica , a white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle with the stereotypes that she grew up with : ' Tm figuring out the math and not just the stereotypes ; any of those stereotypes that I grew up with in an all-white community . " Struggling to understand why she was not told the " truth " growing up , Jessica , like many of the other RE 's who were raised in similar environments , initially struggled to understand and come to terms with what they had been taught . Involvement in the RE program , helped them to learn by critically reflecting upon and challenging their own and others ' stereotypes . <p> Improved confidence and an enhanced capacity to serve as allies to the LGB community <p> The students who are participants in the RE program typically plan to be teachers , counselors , lawyers ; they want to work in schools , nonprofit organizations , and businesses . As one of the RE 's , Parker , a white gay male graduate student noted , " The education that we 've gotten as Rainbow Educators and the experience of doing this has added a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take into the rest of our endeavors , at the university and elsewhere in the real world . It 's a real skill-building thing , a confidence building thing . " Many found the training to be informative and educational . Having more knowledge of any subject related to issues of sexual orientation , can help people feel more comfortable speaking out , and able to be allies to the LGB community . To be sure , with issues of sexual orientation , where people tend to feel less comfortable , a solid educational experience can be quite beneficial . Some of the students explained that as a result of their training in the RE program , they had developed an informed response to questions and attacks made on them personally , and they felt empowered to reach out to others to educate them . <p> Tim talked about how much he benefited personally from the training , noting that : <p> Particularly for someone like me , to be given an assignment to do something works best . And it did expand my knowledge . Our trainings , and particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudiced or whatever , you just want to scream , rather than have this sort of an informed response . And we really worked on that . And that , in and of itself , is very helpful because that 's something you come across , being gay every day or quite frequently . <p> The program provided Tim with the necessary skills to positively engage with others versus " just screaming " at them . This way , he was more able to educate others who previously might not have listened to him . <p> Similarly , Carol , a white heterosexual undergraduate student , whose mother is a lesbian , talked about how she has had trouble in the past because she responds to people more emotionally than she thinks she should , stating : <p> It 's good for someone as argumentative as I am to know all the information . So that 's been great . I think that the training has given me the confidence to calm down and to understand how to answer questions . And I think all of the kind of mock **26;273;TOOLONG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> For Amy and Emily , who are both white heterosexual faculty members , having factual information and hearing from others with more knowledge on the subject made a big difference in their readiness to be vocal supporters of the LGB community and become allies . Amy said : <p> I want to be an advocate for change and want to be an ally and feel that I 'm useful here . This has been an enormous education for me .. I feel like I can speak as more of an authoritative ally than just someone who just feels like they 're an ally . <p> Straight , gay , and lesbian members told us again and again how the information they received during RE training helped them learn more and/or feel more comfortable and connected to the LGB community . Deona , who is a heterosexual undergraduate student of color , and who had attended meetings for the LGB club on campus ( PRIDE ) , said : <p> I 'm not afraid to go to a PRIDE meeting . I 'm not afraid to have a conversation with someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or how to act . I 'm more comfortable talking about the issues . I 'm more comfortable using the words . I feel a lot closer to the issues , a lot closer to the gay community at USD . I feel like I 'm a liaison , a part of it . <p> Positive impact on the university community <p> After the first two years of the program , RE 's reported greater sensitivity to homophobic speech on campus , and they perceived a decline in casual homophobic comments both in and out of the classroom . " Fag " and " dyke " jokes and slurs seemed less common , and if they did occur , students were better equipped to challenge them . Deona recalled an incident after hearing a male student say , " That 's so gay " : <p> I 've seen just little things , you know , a student correcting another student . And I knew she had been to a presentation . So to see her correct somebody-and it was especially interesting ' cause it was in the multicultural center and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman to a man . So , to me , that blew me away . Because , you know , the whole machismo culture of Latinos is , you know , a woman does n't tell a man what to do . A woman does n't correct a man . And my , when she first corrected him I assumed that he was going to , you know , say , " Oh , whatever . " Make a joke on it or tell her to be quiet or whatever . But he did n't . He respected her enough that he was okay with her correcting him and he apologized for what he said . And that was huge . <p> As they grew more comfortable with their own sexual orientation , the RE 's became more vocal in " coming out " either as LGB or as heterosexual allies of the LGB community . Many people were more comfortable with their own sexual orientation and more willing to talk about LGB issues without fear ( or caring ) that they would be assumed to be LGB . Audiences often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience for the RE 's and the groups to which they presented that it was not necessary to be LGB to want to stop homophobia . John , a gay undergraduate student of color , declared , " Rainbow Educators and USD have really come together and have really built a safe , comfortable environment that does n't tolerate any hate , that makes other students feel like comfortable with who they are . " <p> This attitude has extended beyond the RE 's to the wider campus community . Without claiming full credit , it does not seem coincidental that a number of LGB persons and allies have come out in 1999-2001 , the two years of the RE program we studied . Several faculty and staff felt comfortable coming out  --  or at least not pretending they were heterosexual . Linda , who is a heterosexual faculty member of color , reported , " The exposure has been very positive . I 've had more students coming out to me . I had a candidate for a faculty position come out to me . " <p> PRIDE no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a website . <p> It sponsors programs , brings speakers to campus , receives budget allocations , and has a seat on the student government senate . Members are more open ( although still cautious ) about revealing their involvement in the club ; non-member students , faculty , and staff often attend PRIDE programs . Marsha , an undergraduate lesbian student of color observed : <p> We 've been getting a little more participation in our PRIDE group . I 'm feeling things are getting a little more comfortable . Maybe I 'm just naive . But I feel things are getting a little bit better . And we 're making ourselves a little more visible . And when I say , ' We , ' I mean PRIDE and its ' supporters . <p> In short , PRIDE has become ( virtually ) like any other club . To discuss LGB issues no longer carries the automatic assumption that the speaker must be LGB . Undergraduate student John confirmed : <p> This RE is the only program that is able to talk about sexuality on campus . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campus that homosexuality does exist . I think back before , the organization known as PRIDE . was very hush-hush and it was very underground . And now it 's out there . And I think Rainbow Educators have built that . Starting to build a comfort zone , talking about sexuality . <p> Not only has the RE program contributed to an atmosphere where community members feel more comfortable coming out as allies and LGB , it has also helped make sexual orientation a visible and legitimate topic of conversation on campus . Participants felt that nurturing open dialogue about sexuality had been the most significant impact of the program on campus climate ; this was noted by nearly all of the RE 's . The RE program dictates neither the agenda nor the conclusions drawn by participants in this dialogue ; it promotes honesty , awareness , and up-to-date information so that authentic exchanges can occur . Harry remarked : <p> I think the RE 's kind of helped change campus climate a little bit because all of a sudden there was this group that was talking about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the sense that it 's more of a sense of acceptance that this is something that goes  --  that is an issue here and needs to be addressed . <p> It has become more commonplace for faculty to include discussions of sexual orientation and the LGB community in courses , where appropriate . A course titled " Sociology of Sexual Orientation " has been added to the regular curriculum in the College of Arts &; Sciences , the first regularly offered course focusing on sexual orientation . <p> RE presentations have become regular parts of the training program for Peer Counselors and graduate assistants in Student Affairs . After RE 's distributed pink triangles proclaiming an " Open Zone " for discussion of issues related to sexual orientation , the triangles appeared on a number of office doors on campus . John commented : <p> But we 're able to talk about it . And I think that 's  --  being part  --  Rainbow Educators , they think it 's a good program because it enables not only the program and the facilitators , but staff , professors , graduate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was  --  I do n't think there was ever any dialogue about it . <p> The program has helped break the silence of speaking about sexual orientation as a verboten subject . Speaking the words " gay , " " lesbian , " and " bisexual " without snickering or degradation supported change in the climate . Emily discussed the changes she noticed in her own classroom : <p> And some things that we read about in some of my classes would bring sort of snickers , or , you know , that kind of response . And I 've been thinking about this because I 've been working on my assessment of the course revision that I did last term . And looking back through a lot of the things that students wrote in exams . And in the past semester I had none of that reaction . <p> Marsha , remarked , " I think that , also , a lot of the straight people here actually have open minds . They just need people to engage with and actually say that they know a gay person . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come up to us and thank us for having these discussions . What else do you need as evidence to say this needs to be happening more ? " Summary <p> The RE program provides students , faculty and staff , straight , gay and bisexual people , with opportunities to engage with one another in a reciprocal process of learning and teaching . Creating a democratic setting where everyone feels a sense of responsibility to contribute to the learning of the group is a crucial component of the RE program . This model of collaboration demonstrates the powerful learning that occurs , and the potential impact it can have on campus when diverse groups of undergraduate students , graduate students , faculty , staff , and alumni commit to working together and sustaining a program that addresses issues of intolerance in their campus community . This is not a model wherein the faculty or staff member is the authority , or the RE 's who are gay , lesbian , or bisexual are assumed to be the experts on issues of sexual orientation . In fact , the process of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , straight , gay or bisexual students may be the teachers , and the professors and professional staff are the learners , or vice versa . In this way , those in formal positions of authority are not expected to have all of the answers ; they are co-participants in a learning experience ( Tierney , 1993 ) . <p> The impact this program had on the participants and on the campus community is evident . It is a powerful reminder that change is not simply possible , but probable , when programs are in place that increase participants ' skills and knowledge of issues related to sexual orientation . This study provides helpful insights for those who might consider developing a similar program at any religiously affiliated institution . First , a successful program will be consistent , and not in opposition to , the university mission and vision for the campus . Second , the program must be well-developed , with materials that are up to date and build upon existing knowledge of the group . Third , the training must be engaging and enjoyable , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the program should include participants who are diverse in their thinking , who represent a broad range of campus constituents ( students , faculty , staff , etc ) , and who are racially , ethnically and sexually diverse . In summary , it is time for anyone who seeks to create a more tolerant campus community to " meet in the middle , " thus reducing the chasm that so often divides our communities . We must work together across professional boundaries , student faculty relationships , religious beliefs , and personal and professional ideologies , if we expect to improve the campus climate for lesbian , gay , and bisexual faculty , staff , and students . Footnotes <p> ( n1 ) In 2001 sexual orientation was added to the university 's nondiscrimination clause , in part through the efforts of the Rainbow Educator Program . However , the policy states that the university does not disclaim any right it might otherwise have to maintain its commitment to its Catholic identity . This statement does not satisfy everyone , but it does represent significant progress toward recognizing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
