<p> When friends and colleagues tell Vanessa Wittman she must be nuts , she does not argue the point . <p> After all , who in their right mind would shepherd troubled telecom provider 360networks through a 16-month bankruptcy only to take on the more onerous task of guiding battered Adelphia Communications Corp . through its very public financial travails ? <p> As chief financial officer at the bankrupt Greenwood Village cable company , Wittman holds what might be the toughest private-sector job in Colorado . <p> Her top priorities : Guide Adelphia as it cleanses its books of billions of dollars of allegedly fraudulent accounting , complete a now 21-month-old bankruptcy journey and help make peace with federal regulators . <p> Wittman , 36 , is among a handful of top corporate chieftains forced to become bankruptcy whizzes on the fly . <p> Corporate financial failures have surged since the 1990s , which has left top financial talent capping the rescue of one insolvent company only to rush to the aid of another . Some venture capitalists and private-equity firms keep such emergency experts on speed dial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expert as ' my worst nightmare combined with the greatest opportunity to work with smart people that you could imagine . <p> ' It can be incredibly scintillating and incredibly frustrating all at the same time , ' she said . <p> Executives who linger in particularly troubled industries , such as telecom , are likely to endure multiple corporate bankruptcies or accounting restatements , but no one has officially tracked the trend , said Bettina Whyte , president of the American Bankruptcy Institute . <p> ' What we see more of , especially with the CFOs and general counsels , is people who enjoyed ( managing a bankruptcy ) and are trying to find the next company that might be in trouble so they can try to work some magic on it , ' Whyte said . <p> Like Wittman , former ICG Communications chief executive Randall Curran has done two tours in corporate bankruptcy . <p> The first time was in 1994 , when he led Thermadyne Holdings , a St. Louis-based maker of welding and cutting equipment , through bankruptcy . Six years later , he joined ICG @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company through its two-year bankruptcy case that ended in October 2002 with the company intact . <p> Along the way , Curran averted what looked like the certain liquidation of ICG , but he also weathered a longer-than-anticipated bankruptcy . Opportunistic creditors dickered for months over how much new money they would commit to the company , he said . <p> ' The challenge and complexity of multiple , interconnected problems is what makes restructuring interesting , ' Curran said via e-mail . ' But , the poor behavior and destructive attitudes that creditors and other parties ( for example , the government ) bring to the process can make it incredibly miserable . ' <p> Even solvent companies occasionally call upon experts to help them repair their balance sheets outside of bankruptcy court . Such was the case when Qwest chief executive Richard Notebaert tapped his former colleague Oren Shaffer to right the Denver-based phone company 's financial woes . <p> Shaffer is a former CFO of Ameritech , the Chicago-based regional Bell acquired by SBC Communications in 1999 . <p> In July 2002 , he was named Qwest 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2.5 billion in revenue on Qwest 's past books , a process that was completed in October . <p> The hours logged by Qwest employees on that work totaled 60 years , the company estimates . The company paid auditors on the project $ 34.5 million in 2002 alone . <p> ' I would not want to do it again , ' Shaffer said . ' I actually commend ( Wittman ) for having the courage and the will to have a go at another one of these things . ' <p> Wittman understands challenge . <p> The Connecticut-raised daughter of a magazine distribution executive and a homemaker , Wittman graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor 's degree in business from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill . Her MBA is from the University of Virginia . A collegiate tennis player , she landed on the Atlantic Coast Conference 's student-athlete honor roll for eight semesters . <p> Wittman 's career took her to Andersen Consulting , investment bank Morgan Stanley , a California venture capital firm , wireless broadband provider Metricom Inc. , and Microsoft Corp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maffei to 360networks , a hungry , Vancouver , British Columbia , company that was rapidly expanding by purchasing smaller telecom network companies . <p> 360networks sold its first public shares in April 2000 , and filed for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the United States 14 months later , in the middle of an industry-wide meltdown . Wittman , by then three months into her work as 360networks ' CFO , began to steer the company back to solvency . It took 17 months . <p> ' We brought it in , ' Wittman said , ' we were going to bring it out . ' <p> Shortly after emerging from reorganization in November 2002 , 360networks bought rival Canadian telecom Group Telecom and Wittman got the bug to move on . <p> She had some experience with the cable industry through her work as Microsoft 's senior director of corporate development , so Adelphia drew her attention . <p> Wittman joined Adelphia last March . <p> Her task is Herculean , but she says her bet on this complicated bankruptcy is hedged by the leadership strength of Adelphia chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Adelphia filed for Chapter 11 in 2002 with $ 18.6 billion in debt . Three members of its founding family , including CEO John Rigas , were accused of bilking the company out of billions of dollars and were indicted on fraud charges . <p> Rigas , his sons , Michael and Timothy and former Adelphia finance executive Michael Mulcahey are now on trial in New York . They have pleaded not guilty . <p> ' The truth is , they were busy looting Adelphia and cheating the other shareholders , ' federal prosecutor Richard Owens said this month during opening arguments in the trial . ' They were also busy cooking the books . ' <p> When Wittman arrived at Adelphia , which moved to Greenwood Village from Coudersport , Pa. , in 2003 , she found no crooked accountants , just shellshocked employees . <p> Scott MacDonald , a former AT &T; Broadband accountant recruited to be Adelphia 's chief accounting officer , had already begun reviewing and recasting Adelphia 's books dating to 1998 . <p> Adelphia 's bankruptcy filing spanned 243 subsidiaries . Just to trace cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wittman 's team had to examine 7 million transactions . <p> Once that puzzle is complete , the team will need to review everything with its new auditor , PricewaterhouseCoopers . The company has so far spent more than $ 40 million on the fix . <p> At the same time , Wittman must negotiate with hundreds of creditors . Among the biggest are investors who gobbled up Adelphia bonds on the cheap before the bankruptcy filing , hoping to gain control of the company . Among those are W.R. Huff &; Co. ; The Blackstone Group ; Angelo , Gordon &; Co. ; and Fidelity Investments . <p> ' There 's a lot of money at stake , ' Wittman said . ' There are a lot of details to grasp . Small movements can determine big value shifts between ( creditors ) . So you end up arguing over minutiae because it can have dramatic effects on recoveries . ' <p> Last month , Adelphia submitted a plan in bankruptcy court outlining how it will pay its creditors . The plan values Adelphia at $ 17 billion . Adelphia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The negotiations with creditors , lenders and other parties to the bankruptcy have kept Wittman in New York more than Colorado as of late . That has been difficult but not unexpected for her family : husband Drew , 38 , and sons Parker , 6 , and Mason , 4 . <p> ' She makes the most of her time when she 's here in Denver with the boys , ' said Drew Wittman , who left a sales job at Silicon Graphics Inc. to stay home with the children . <p> Ultimately , Wittman likely will play a role in resolving a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation of Adelphia , still the fifth-largest cable company by subscribers . <p> She considers her work to resolve a second corporate bankruptcy in three years an anomaly . <p> " Even 30 days before I met ( Adelphia CEO ) Bill ( Schleyer ) , if someone had said , ' You 're going to do another bankruptcy , ' I would have laughed out loud , " she said .
