Q : On a recent flight , I found the manicotti too darn spicy . I plan to travel a lot this summer and wonder how I can avoid such gastric discomfort ? <P> A : Just call ahead and request a bland meal . That 's right  --  along with kosher and vegetarian choices , most airlines offer a bland meal . For breakfast , it might include a muffin and unsalted margarine , and for dinner some lean chicken and perhaps a pear half or two . And yes , you can get a first-class version as well , which is bland in the most deluxe way . <P> Q : I love peanut butter , but sometimes having to stick the knife in the jar seems so labor intensive . Is there an easier way to make lunch ? <P> A : Help is on the way . Food researchers at Oklahoma State University have created individually wrapped slices of peanut butter , and Smucker 's new line of frozen peanut-butter-and-jelly sandwiches is already available in some cities . Should you tire of this lunchbox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't have to expend any effort draining juice from a can . To eat it , though , you 'll still need a utensil . Not so with IncrEdibles ' microwavable macaroni and cheese on a stick or its push-pop scrambled eggs . You 'll appreciate the strength you save .
