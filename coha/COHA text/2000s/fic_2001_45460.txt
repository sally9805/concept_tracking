YOU KNOW HOW IT STARTED ? A knock at the door . Several knocks , as a matter of fact , at the door to the family room . <p> I ignored them , but that did n't do any God damn good . My train of thought was already derailed , and besides , it took less than two minutes for what 's his face to change his mind and come to the front door . I tried hard to ignore that too , but when I looked up , I could see the guy peeking at me through the glass in the front door . Mighty tall sucker , if he could manage that . The four glass panels make a fan across the top of the door , high enough that even though I 'm five feet eight and a fraction , I ca n't see out unless I 'm wearing high heels . Well , plainly , he knew I was home , so I gave up and dumped all my chemistry textbooks off my lap onto the sofa . <p> When I pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . A white guy . He was n't bad looking , either , except for the ski jump slope to his nose . A young Richard Nixon nose , that was , but thank God without tricky Dick 's other signature feature - those thick bulldog jowls . <p> " Good morning , ma'am ! " he started out . He was trying to hand me a magazine . <p> I struck a pose , fist on hip . " Where have you been , Bubba ? " <p> " I 'd like to ... what ? " <p> " Listen , Mom already called over here three times today , looking for you . Are you gon na show up and take her to church on Sunday or not ? " <p> The smile dissolved like a handful of sugar in black coffee . His dark eyes did a nice demonstration of Brownian motion while he tried to figure out what in the hell I was talking about . <p> " Lady , I do n't even know your mom . " <p> " Oh , right . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world , and now you do n't even know who she is . What kind of son are you , anyway ? " <p> He started shaking his head . I could tell he was right on the brink of a major reaction , so I turned up his Bunsen burner . <p> " Y'know , Daddy 's lookin ' for your ass , too . He says , either you pay him back by next week or he gives up on grandkids and cuts your damn nuts off . " <p> " Whoa ! " Magazine Man started backing off , big time . " Look , lady , you got me mixed up with somebody else ..... " <p> At this , I smiled and drawled , " Nuh uh . No way , Bubba . I know you just about every way a girl can . " <p> The man gasped outright . Lightning quick , his glance flicked up and down , taking in me and my crow 's feet , my dowdy tom sweats and my less than svelte figure . " I , uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... bad time , " he told me , his voice breathless , his feet searching out a retreat down the steps at his back . <p> " No shit , Sherlock . " Idly , I flicked my pocket knife open and started in trimming a hangnail . <p> Again came that flash of pure panic , and then a loud bang as he took a blind leap off the porch and crashed into my trash can . He knocked it right over , but kept going even as I shouted after him . " What am I s'posed to tell Mom about Sunday ? " <p> He looked back at me over his shoulder , to make sure I did n't give chase , I suppose , and while doing that , he ran smack into my mailbox . I know that one hurt . Sucker 's mounted on steel pipe and anchored with two bags of concrete . Still did n't go down , though . That boy must 've played wide receiver in college or something . He grabbed the box , swung his long body around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on down the street , the damn magazine still in his hand , flapping all the way . <p> I stepped inside again . I closed the door , put my back to it , slid down it onto the carpet and busted up , but good . Man . Took me most of an hour to get back to studying van der Waal 's forces and quantum mechanics , so I did n't gain a damn thing by my preemptive strike on the poor guy . <p> That 's how it began , though , stupid games with the door-to-door salesmen . No real harm intended . No , I was just trying to pay the chumps back for disrupting my study time , trying to head at least some of them off at the pass . <p> The house is the reason why . It 's an old house , built by the man who once had a blacksmith 's shop on the corner lot right beside this one , and somewhat peculiar because of the way that he built it . He did all the work himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did n't know all that much about how to design a house , how to lay out the rooms , how to make things convenient . That 's why it has such a long , tubular living room , ten feet by twenty-two . That 's why both bathrooms are in the one corner I 'm told by the family that he forgot to put them in at all , and then had to enlarge the whole house to accommodate the necessary once his wife got a look at the place . While he was at it , he added a family room that stuck out to one side quite a bit , with a door of its own . <p> Well , the end result was an L-shaped house with what looks like two front doors facing the driveway , one door on each leg . They 're identical doors . To a salesman , it looks like a duplex . So they march right up to your door and they just do n't care if they wake you up , or they interrupt something important , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got rid of them , all of a sudden , they 've gone to the other door , banging away again . <p> It gets so frustrating . I work at night , see , because I 'm in graduate school , and when I 'm not asleep or at work , then I 'm studying . After Glenn took off , I figured I might as well rebuild my whole life instead of just patching the holes in it . So I went back to school . I 'm going to finish it this time , no matter what . I 'm going to get my damn master 's , and maybe a Ph.D . too , while I 'm at it , and no one - but nobody - gets in my way this time . I 'm going to keep going . I am not going to let anything stop me . <p> I did that once . I let Glenn get me pregnant , then married , then bing , bang , boom , I had to drop out of school so that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into nothing . I miscarried . I did n't have to get married at all , and I do n't really know to this day why I stayed married after that . Maybe I just did n't have a real sense of myself . My ambitions were all nothing more than electron orbits of pure possibility . With or without ol ' man Heisenberg , none of them had any certainty to them nothing that I could have measured or quantified , let alone leaned on . <p> I left all of that to Glenn , and it worked well enough , I suppose , up till he got his sheepskin . With his Ph.D . came his big break at SmithKline McKesson . He moved into Eileen Rubana 's research lab and that 's when dear Glenn lost all interest in me . Took a shine to Eileen instead . It was like a reduction reaction , the two of them falling into a lower state of electropotential energy than they could ever climb out of again . God knows , I could n't pull them apart , not with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one that corrodes anything in the universe . Use that , you 're going to destroy everything in the process , including yourself . <p> So I did n't fight it , except for the house , which he 'd never liked all that much anyway . <p> So , yeah . Six months and a handful of paperwork later , I found myself cut loose , afloat in a sea of inertia . For weeks , I was reactionless , my soul nearly frozen , my hopes slipping so close to absolute zero I almost turned into a Bose-Einstein condensate . Took me another six months or more before heat began leaking back into my being , before I could warm up to something like a life-supporting temperature again . <p> It 's a funny thing , though . Once our molecular marriage broke up , I discovered I do have polarity after all . I have a charge , and it may be a negative one , but it 's something dependable . Something to push me away from some things , and attract me to others . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spark of pure outrage around noon , when I heard another knock , this one a bang on the living room door . I was knee-deep in counting electron shells , in trying to work out a stressed bond experiment that would pass muster with Dr. Schymkowsky , my thesis advisor . Now that the Finns have succeeded in making argon fluorohydride , there 's only two of the noble gases left to crack - neon and helium . I had a notion about how to do that , too , how to force neon to link up with hydrogen fluoride and make a new molecule God did n't think of . <p> But no , God decided he had an appointment with me , or a couple of Witnesses thought He did , anyhow . So I shed paper all over the floor as I shot to my feet and I marched toward the door . When I opened it , there were a pair of adults and a kid on the porch . A man , a woman , a boy , all dressed up in their Sunday best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to admit , I do not have a perfect politeness record where Jehovah 's Witnesses are concerned . I have been known to yell at them now and then . I 've posted signs , and with one persistent white-walled bastard , I had to go turn on the hose and make physical threats with it . I 've played some games with them , too . I remember once , back in my undergraduate days , I spent two hours jiving a pair of them , trying like hell to convince them that Vishnu loved them just as much as Jehovah did , and the theory of reincarnation could even be used to explain the Republican Party 's political platform , not to mention Richard Nixon 's resignation . But I did n't bother with that again . Too much time and energy that belonged to me , not God , and certainly not to the Witnesses . <p> So - I ca n't say I 've never been bad . But I 've never been tempted to do any real harm to them , or even spend another chunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a speedy return to my peace and quiet , so I could continue to beat my head against the wall and work out a decent experimental protocol . <p> I stared at the threesome on my stoop and simply said , " I do n't have time for this stuff . " <p> Then I shut the door firmly and headed straight back to the couch . And it took all of one minute for them to knock on the other door . Loudly . <p> I swore at the furniture , kicked at the couch and the scatter of paper . Then I started marching again , toward the kitchen . You walk through the kitchen to get to the family room . Then you hang a sharp right to get to the other door . It 's about thirty feet through there . Somewhere mid-linoleum , though , inspiration struck , and I stripped off my sweatshirt and slippers . I snatched up a dish towel , wound it around my head like a sweat band , grabbed the broom , and then , in my T-shirt and socks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other door . <p> " Hello ! " I warbled . " How are you today ? " <p> And then , as they stared at me , I let my own eyebrows narrow a bit with sudden suspicion . I glanced at the big stack of Watch Towers one of them carried , and then at the other front door . <p> " Say , did my sister send you guys over here ? " <p> The man and the woman shot looks at each other . The boy kept on staring . <p> I let a dark scowl set up on my face and then I took an angry step toward them . I banged the hell out of the screen with my broomstick . " Well , you can just march right back over there . You tell her , knock it off ! I got my housework to do ! " <p> The man blanked out completely . He blinked several times , trying to figure out how to react to me . She did a better job . I watched her eyebrows fly upward , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spiel going . " We , uh , we just wanted to ask if you 'd heard the Good News . " But the boy was the most fun . He stared up at me with white rings around both eyes , and then he backed up till he stepped off the porch altogether and fell on his ass . <p> Well , I did suffer one flash of worry , for fear that he 'd hurt himself . I still do n't know if the worry was more for his sake or mine . I , after all , was the homeowner . I could be sued , even though they were all uninvited . <p> But he bounced back up again like he was made out of rubber . He made it back onto his feet before I 'd even managed to get the screen door open , hollering , " Honey , are you all right ? " <p> He just kept backing up , rubbing his butt with one hand , and the two grownups followed him , asking the same question I had . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I went back in the house and I shut the door . Then I collapsed on the carpet , on top of the broom , and I laughed myself sick . <p> It was wonderful therapy . Took all the stress out of stressed bonds , at least for me . Let me get back to the job at hand . Let me quit chomping my pencils to pieces . I suspect that it even helped get Schymkowsky to smile on my efforts . At least he signed off on the project . Fluorine compounds are popular these days , what with IBM trying to use them to build elementary circuits for quantum computers . They 're dangerous , though . After all , fluorine killed the first half dozen chemists who did any serious work on the stuff . But any success at all ought to be worth a good job with the big research labs . Hey , if dear Glenn can land one of those , why not me ? I 've spent a whole lot more time in the kitchen than he has . I may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know how to cook . <p> I know how to be silly , too . <p> Like the game with the two front doors . No rules , really , just whatever came to mind between the two . Of course , some days , I 've had a lot more inspiration than others . Like this last week , when I had a salesman show up with some kind of a miracle cleaner he wanted to demonstrate . <p> I was n't in the best of moods . I 'd been up all night chewing on qubits and quantum computers . It just is n't natural , thinking about how electrons encode quantum data , because with a qubit , you do n't just have the normal electronic choices , y'know , yes or no , one or zero . No , sir . With qubits , you get to have your cake and eat it too . Your single qubit can code for both states at once - yes and no , zero and one . Which means you get to use both at once , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I think too hard about things like that . Quantum mechanics is just too damn spooky . I used to think it was just me being dumb , but it drove Einstein crazy too . Him and Schrodinger argued about it for years on end . <p> Well , like I said , I 'd been up all night long . I was in sore need of a shower , and my hair was greasy enough to stand up and march into the bathroom all by itself . Pissed me off , this guy banging away at the front door . He came by so early , for one thing , and then , when I peeked through the blinds , I got madder yet . It was so obvious he saw himself as a man on the move , an up-and-comer . The guy goes around door to door and he 's wearing a three-piece suit , for God 's sake , and his hair - hell , I know it 's the hair that got to me the most . It was just like Glenn 's . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glenn had his hair styled with exactly that kind of a " power " cut , blow-dried and plastered in place with a " masculine " scented hair spray , like that in itself was enough to change his isotope and disguise the geek living inside his white lab coat . <p> The dumb shit . <p> I flung the door open and posed myself , fist on hip , letting o1 ' Stud Muffin get a real eyeful of me and my torn sweats , my Doc Martens . No doubt my " eau de sincerity " wafted his way as well . <p> Even so , he took a shot . The guy spewed out this whole spiffy line about his little bottle of miracle cleaner and silicone sealer , so concentrated and so damn good that he thought $19.95 for a jug was a bargain . The trouble was , Mr. Stud Muffin just was n't that good a salesman . I would n't have bought the crap anyway , certainly not at the price he was quoting , but then when I opened the screen door to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let his gut reaction to me show itself , plain as day , in the way his high-styled head jerked back and away from me . God , it was just like a turtle retracting its neck . Then he swallowed his distaste and tried it on anyway . He waved a hand at my Nissan , which had n't been washed in a couple of months . <p> " I 'd he happy to show you how well it works . " <p> I shook my head , fed up with all of it , starting to close the front door . " I 'm not interested , " I told him , letting my voice drop as low as I could , down to Lauren Bacall range . <p> " It wo n't take a minute , " he told me . " How else am I going to convince you how good it is ? " <p> " Honey , you ai n't . " I said that while I looked the man straight in the eyes , letting him know that I was n't talking about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persistent , though . I 'll give him that . He smiled , sweet as could be . Told me , " Ma'am , I would sure like just one chance to change your mind . " <p> Yeah , I 'll just bet you would , I thought . <p> I pointed the man toward the other front door . " Maybe you should go talk to my sister instead . She likes talking to men . " My tone left no real doubt about my inclinations , and he was n't slow to pick up on it either . <p> " Okay , well , you have a nice day , then , " he said ; switching gears with an audible sigh of relief . <p> " Right . " I closed the door . <p> Soon as the latch clicked , I ran hell for leather , straight into the kitchen , and then I cut left for the bathroom . I snagged my black makeup bag , pulled out a lipstick and smeared it across damn near half of my face . Made myself a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes with blue eye shadow , then stuck my fingers down into my hair , yanked the greasy strands upright and shot hairspray at them as well as a big spritz of Charlie , the stinkiest stuff I own . <p> Ah ! From the family room came the knock I was waiting for . <p> I shrieked . " I 'm coming ! Hold on . I 'll be right there . " <p> The housecoat was mostly to cover my sweats , but it seemed like a real good idea in its ownself , and I fought to cinch it in place as I trotted back into the kitchen and then . through the family room . <p> " I 'm coming ! " I cried again . <p> Then I got hold of the knob and I pulled the door open just as he was turning to step off the porch . <p> His face froze at the sight of me . Froze solid . He never got even one word out although his eyes both turned into full moons as he stared at me . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My sweet honeybun . I 've been waiting all day for a great big handsome man like you . You have got to come in here and spend some time . " <p> Then I gave him my winningest smile and I opened the screen door and leaned toward him , thrusting my cleavage his way just like I had a pair of Madonna 's rockets strapped to my chest . <p> I kept it up even when his manly jaw dropped and some of his perfect white teeth threatened suicide . <p> " Quality time , honey . Come on in and get you some . " <p> " NgaaaaaAAAAAHHHHH ! " <p> Stud Muffin ran for it . Ran like a God damn deer , hurdling over the Nissan 's filthy left front fender without even leaving a skid mark . Prettiest thing I have ever seen . Carl Lewis could n't have done any better . He kept his grip on his spray bottle though . More 's the pity , ' cause I really did need to wash that car . <p> Probably would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the weekend and suddenly I had mud for a paint job and brown drifts of leaves almost everywhere else . I 've got three valley oaks out in front of the house . They 're right on the curb line but they 're protected from chainsaws and sidewalk installers because they 're all heritage trees according to California law . Three giants . They do n't cut loose with the leaves until mid-December , but when they shed ' em , they do it in spades . <p> I was standing at the sink and gazing out at the shifting drifts of leaves through the kitchen window . I was thinking of getting the blower out when I saw the man in the hat stop and stare at my house . Hispanic , I think , but he could have been Greek . He had that kind of swarthy Zorba look and a large hooked nose . <p> He also had a calculating frown on his face , and a brand new pair of Air Jordans on his feet , which I found slightly at odds with his shanks ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as a sharp right turn into my driveway , and since he had no car , no briefcase , and no order book , I already had some notion what he was up to . <p> I answered the front door barefoot , and dressed in my rattiest jeans , but gave him a gracious smile . He had one too , and he started in right away . " Say , lady , my car 's broke down back there . I think I ran outta gas .... " <p> I bobbed my head like the little Dutch girl and said , " Sprecken Sie Deutsch ? Ich bin auslander . " <p> He shook his head , puzzled , then tried again . " Look , I just need a dollar , a couple of bucks .... " <p> I said , " Bitte schon , gehen Sie nach Gehenna . " Then I bobbed another quick curtsey and stared at him until he shook his head and gave up on me . <p> The man in the hat , of course , did not go to hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I was waiting for him . <p> This time , I planned to answer in French , but when I pulled the door open , he was still perched on the other porch , in the middle of turning away . And the other front door was still closing . <p> He spotted me just then , and peered at me for a split second before whirling back toward the door to the living room , so fast he just about lost the hat . I heard the other door bang shut , a sound that seemed somehow to echo inside my head . Then I got dizzy . The man in the hat did n't feel so good either , I guess , because he began backing away down the driveway while crossing himself every second step . When he got back to the street , he took off with such speed that the hat did fly off his head , falling to join the drifted leaves , one more piece of flotsam adorning my life . <p> I could not figure out what the hell had just happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my middle ears settled down , was one I 'd heard in my graduate seminar  --  quantum nonlocality . One of Einstein 's biggest bugaboos . See , you can snag electrons off the same molecule , then separate them by yards , even miles , but somehow they keep track of each other . As soon as you measure polarity on the one , why , the other one turns out to have exactly the same polarity . Something links them . Something keeps them in the same quantum state . It 's almost like there 's one electron in two places at one and the same time . <p> It 's something to do with that damn cat of Schrodinger 's . You know , the cat in the box with the quantum bomb , the cat with an equal chance of being alive or dead . That guy Schr6dinger , he said the cat was both , alive and dead , up until someone opened the damn box and looked at it . <p> I 've been thinking about that a lot . Y'see , quantum mechanics is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things way too teeny to see , but this thing with my front doors , well , that was n't teeny at all , and it just makes me wonder if some other folks are right . What if that cat is alive and dead , even after you look in the box ? What if every single decision we make splits the whole world apart into separate universes , one where the cat lives and one where it dies ? After all , are n't our brains s'posed to work off those very same quantum mechanics ? Our consciousness ? So what if your brain one day up and decides to do things on a larger , more visible scale ? <p> What if that 's not the end of it ? What if those split universes can come back together again ? So long as nothing major has changed , I mean . So long as most of those split-off electrons still have the same polarity ? <p> I kicked it around through a week 's worth of dishes that morning , but I got a fresh visitation before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This time it was a Brownie troop . They were selling strings of jingle bells and sprigs of mistletoe tied up with red ribbon . <p> Right . I was only three days past the last of my finals , and not in the mood for a holiday romance . No way , babe , not even if there 'd been a prospect in sight . Which there was n't . I 'd been oh so careful to avoid catalytic reactions at school , as well as a number of semi-free radicals floating around at work , popping their wedding rings off every time they dipped into some free-flowing holiday solvent . <p> Still , I did n't need any blatant reminders of my single ( and by now highly charged ) status , and that 's what I blame for the mean-minded turn things took this time around . See , just like that man in the hat , I saw them through my kitchen window , coming up the drive . Six of them , counting the two adults , one of whom wore a spangled green sweatshirt and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The other one sported a beehive hairdo right out of the fifties . In it , she 'd wound holly leaves and a whole string of teeny green Christmas lights , all of them flashing like fire flies on LSD . So , y'see , it was already shaping up into a surreal encounter before I reached into the top drawer and fished out my bread hook . <p> I slammed the drawer shut and I ran toward the front door while stuffing the slotted mixer end of the bread hook and my right fist up inside the sleeve of my sweatshirt . I twisted my face up with one of my more demented grins and I opened the door . What I had in mind was confronting the girls with an isomeric quandary of the Marty Feldman " What hump ? " type from Young Frankenstein . I would present the kids with a mirror image of myself , with the bread hook/hand in my right sleeve , first , and then in my left when I opened the other door . <p> Trouble is , somewhere between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , the group outside split apart , with two brownies and one adult heading for each door . <p> When I heard the knock , in all ignorance , I pulled the door open . I leered at Beehive , and then I caught sight of the other door , over the two little girls ' heads . I saw that door swing open too , and I saw myself , demented grin , bread hook and all . Except her hook was on the same side as mine . Since I was facing her , that made it her left . <p> I stared at her . <p> She stared at me . <p> " Oh , my God , " we said . <p> I backed up . <p> So did she . <p> In the same instant , we slammed the doors shut and then both of us ran for the kitchen . I remember that clearly . The thing is , though , I can remember it from both directions . I came bounding in from the living room and I looked up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the family room . But I know that I was also the one who made that turn and ran in through the wide open side of the kitchen . I know I saw myself come through the doorway that led to the living room . <p> We ran toward each other . <p> I do n't know exactly what I meant to do . I was frightened and shocked , but not angry . I meant to confront her , I suppose , but I did n't try to attack her , I know that . But once we both hit the linoleum , something slid right out from under my feet . Her feet . I was pulled forward somehow . I fell . As I did , I reached out to her with hand and hook .. and she reached for me . <p> The next thing I remember was leaves crunching under my head as I tried to roll over . <p> " Lie still , honey . " That was the Beehive . She had hold of me by the shoulders and she was down on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I blinked . There was cloudy gray sky overhead . I was flat on my back in my driveway , laid out on a cushion of fallen oak leaves . I had a strange metallic taste in my mouth , and I smelled something burning . The odor was thick and dark , charred and unnatural , like the stink you get from an electrical short or a motor that 's burned up . <p> " The Fire Department is on its way , " Beehive said . " You just lie still till they get here . " <p> But .... " <p> Turning my head to the left , I could see my house . Parts of it , anyway . Where the east wall of the kitchen was s'posed to be , I saw this big gaping blackened hole . I saw the sorry remains of my stove , in a scatter of metal and broken spice bottles . I saw the once-white ceiling , now blotched and blackened , with the light fixture dangling by just a wire . Thick-curls of smoke edged their way outward and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's a miracle , " Beehive said . " Us being right here to help you .

" <p> " They 're in there trying to find her right now , " Beehive told me . <p> They never did . One of those big bright red pumper trucks screamed into view and the driveway was suddenly chockfull of firemen , medics and cops . I was carted away to the hospital , and when they brought me back home again , I had a cast on my right arm . I 'd broken both bones in the forearm , and I had a badly burned palm to boot . That and the fingers I 'd used to hold onto the bread hook . " Natural gas leak , " the fireman told me . " The stove got blown right through the wall .

She 's me , but sometimes I find myself in two places at once ? Somehow quantum mechanics has taken a macroscopic spin round my kitchen ? <p> How the hell am I going to explain my twin when I do n't understand it myself ? <p> I just wind up right back at the same question he 's asking . Where is she now ? Is she me again ? Was that explosion sparked by our reunion ? By our two newborn universes coming back together again ? <p> But if she 's here , why do n't I feel her ? <p> Why is n't there anything more than that one half-remembered instant of double vision , me seeing her from both ends of the kitchen ? Why do n't I have burns on both hands ?

How many molecules would it take before we two could not reoccupy the same space anymore ? I do n't know , but if that 's what the problem was , maybe I do know what happened to her . We 've split the two universes apart again , and in this one she 's been totally blown away . Obliterated . <p> Oh , God . I think I killed myself . <p> Author Affiliation
