Will robotics allow physicians to save lives in extreme environments ? PM medical expert Dr. Ken Kamler travels to the ocean floor to investigate . // One morning in April , I pulled up to a nondescript gray stucco duplex that fronted a canal in Key Largo . From the outside , the structure looked like an ordinary Florida condo , but if you peered over the fence into the covered portico , you could see a dizzying collection of air and mixed-gas tanks and the latest high-tech scuba gear splayed out everywhere . I entered the condo to find two women and three men , all shoeless and in shorts and T-shirts , eating breakfast and talking into a speakerphone . They appeared to be laid-back and relaxed , but they were engaged in serious science . The condo was a command center . The barefoot inhabitants were engineers and scientists , and the speakerphone was connected by radio to astronauts who were , at that moment , 3 miles off the coast and 62 ft. under the sea . These astro/aquanauts had been living in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elaborate undersea experiments ever attempted . I was at " mission control " as a consultant to NEEMO 9 ( NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations 9 ) . Led by United Space Alliance scientist Bill Todd , with daily operations managed by Marc Reagan , the NEEMO project places astronauts in an undersea environment to simulate living and working conditions that they may face on the International Space Station , and could one day encounter on the moon and Mars . One of the goals of the NEEMO project is to use technology to enable doctors to perform surgery in environments that are too dangerous or remote to reach in person . I was invited because I am a microsurgeon and because of my experience as a doctor who practices " extreme medicine . " Before I could scuba dive without a NASA escort , I had to be certified as a NURC ( National Underwater Research Center ) diver . The center 's associate director , Otto Rutten , took me out to the Life Support Buoy ( LSB ) floating above the capsule to get tested . After a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstration of some basic scuba knowledge , I was NURC 'd and ready to visit the lab . The Aquarius Undersea Laboratory is a cylinder roughly the size and color of a school bus and about as cramped inside as a space station . I dove down to the seafloor with several NEEMO scientists , where we met up with two astronauts , Dave Williams and Ron Garan , outside the capsule . They were doing an EVA ( Extra-Vehicular Activity ) " moonwalk . " The astronauts were walking upright , thanks to weights added to their belts and boots to simulate the gravitational pull they would feel on Mars-one-third that of the Earth . Accompanying the astronauts was Scuttle , an ROV ( remotely operated vehicle ) that resembles a go-kart . Scuttle was controlled from within the capsule by astronaut Nicole Stott . Today the astronauts were engaged in a building experiment , constructing a temporary Water Lab , using Scuttle to bring them tools . The undersea environment provides more than just a gravitational standin for Mars ; it also approximates the isolation and danger involved in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they would in space-and that demands creative thinking from the astronauts and helps mission planners prepare for when the stakes are higher . Although I spent part of my time with the NEEMO crew observing experiments like these , I was primarily here to witness the first successful attempt to operate a remote robotic surgery system in an extreme environment . On my second day , Dr. Tim Broderick , a University of Cincinnati surgeon , and I watched a robot inside Aquarius replicate the movements of a human 1500 miles away . I 've been present for three generations of NEEMO surgery . In 2004 , I was the first person to do actual surgery inside the capsule-done the old-fashioned way , by hand , after an astronaut sliced his hand cutting PVC tubing . Last year , Tim and I performed mock surgery , following the step-by-step instructions of Dr. Mehran Anvari , director of McMaster University 's Centre for Minimal Access Surgery , who telementored us from Hamilton , Ontario . This year , Anvari , still in Ontario , performed the surgery himself , manipulating a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identical slave robot inside Aquarius . The system was developed in response to an idea ( and funding ) from the U.S. Army 's Telemedicine and Advanced Technology Research Center ( TATRC ) headed by Dr. Gerald Moses , who wanted a robot that could perform surgery in hazardous and remote locations . Designed by SRI International , the M7 surgical robot is the first such machine small enough to fit inside Aquarius . It has two arms that move with seven degrees of freedom : updown ( x-axis ) , left-right ( y-axis ) , in-out ( z-axis ) , yaw ( around x ) , pitch ( around y ) , roll ( around z ) and pinch ( opening and closing of the pincer tips ) . The arm position and movement of the master robot was recorded and sent over the Internet to mission control , where the data were transmitted wirelessly to the LSB , which was hard-wired to Aquarius , then to the slave robot . There is , however , a catch : The system has an unavoidable time delay of 0.250 millisecond due @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our test suture of a plastic tube ( standing in for an artery ) . But when the delay was artificially increased to 3 seconds to mimic transmission to the moon , Anvari lost the ability to tie a knot . The signal delay on a transmission to Mars would be 20 minutes . Clearly , semiautonomous robots will have to be developed to do much of the surgery themselves . The robotic surgery on NEEMO 9 may also prove to have other , nonspace applications . Robotic surgeons could make sophisticated surgery available in dangerous or remote areas-on the battlefield , for instance . Such a system could be used with DARPA 's unmanned Trauma Pod tank-ambulance . My final day with the crew was " splash-up , " when the aquanauts resurface . It 's a journey of around 60 ft. , but it takes nearly 17 hours . Any faster could be deadly . The crew has been breathing pressurized air inside Aquarius , and after 18 days their blood is saturated with nitrogen . If the pressure were suddenly released , they could get the bends-when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that can block blood vessels . The recipe for decompression was nearing completion as we headed out in the morning to greet the aquanauts . As the divers climbed on board our recovery boat , Nicole waved to her husband and son on the spectator boat . Tim took a deep breath and said , " It 's good to feel fresh air . " Ron heard him and said , " So that 's what that smell is .
