Is Donald Rumsfeld afraid to give peace a chance ? Academically , at least , it appears the answer is yes . The Army War College 's Peacekeeping Institute in Carlisle , Pa. , the only government entity dedicated to the task , will close by summer 's end , even while the military struggles to keep the peace in Iraq . Army officials say the closure , endorsed by Rumsfeld , is a money-saving measure , though the institute 's $1 million annual budget represents only .00025% of the military 's annual $400 billion outlay . " Closing the Peacekeeping Institute reflects the Army 's priorities , but we 're in danger of losing in Iraq because we have n't figured out how to do postwar missions , " says Peter Galbraith , a former U.S. diplomat now lecturing military officers at the National Defense University . " We should be strengthening the peacekeeping component of our military , not diminishing it . " <P> Alas , any " lessons learned " during the Peacekeeping Institute 's 10-year life are not readily available to the public . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same day President Bush declared , from the deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln , that " major combat operations " in Iraq were over .  --  By Mark Thompson
