A cradle of pop culture and entrepreneurial sparkle , the Pacific Northwest 's Emerald City truly rocks . Here 's where the trend-making locals go to eat , shop , see , and do . // PHOTOGRAPHS BY CATHERINE KARNOW GRAB A DOUBLE ESPRESSO AND WANDER among the market 's produce vendors , flower sellers , and fishmongers . Watch the gulls wheel over Elliott Bay and the ferries glide to Bainbridge Island . On the western horizon , the Olympic range , ( the continent 's closing act ) is a curtain on the Pacific Ocean . There 's no mistaking Seattle 's bustling city market for anywhere else-just remember one thing : " Do n't make the error everyone else does and call it Pike 's Place , " warns best-selling author Jonathan Raban about his hometown 's premier attraction . " It 's Pike Place , " he says . NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC TRAVELER listened to this sort of advice from locals like Raban in an effort to go beyond such icons as Starbucks , Microsoft , Boeing , and Amazon.com and get the inside scoop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favorite hometown destinations-where the locals like to go . In the process , we uncovered unique neighborhoods , from the Asian flavor of the " ID " ( International District ) to the salty charm of old Ballard , the former Scandinavian fishing community . We found great places to go , from a brew pub in the Capitol Hill neighborhood to a storefront national park . And we found the very best of the great restaurants dishing out great meals . With all there is to see and do , it 's easy to go sleepless in Seattle . ATTRACTIONS ON AND OFF THE WATER BILL RADKE , LATTE IN ONE HAND , banana in the other , might be just another monochromatically clad patron of the Sureshot-a coffeehouse in the " U " or University District . Lauded in his hometown as a radio wit , Radke 's the host of the Saturday show " Rewind , " a humorous take on weekly events , and the new " Weeknight " show . He 's been asked to come up with special Seattle sites , what he likes to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Locks , " he muses . " Y'know about them ? They 're the gateway between the fresh water of Lake Washington and Lake Union and the salt water of Puget Sound . It 's where the salmon come back on annual runs , June through October , and you can watch them right there-leaping and jumping . " I do n't know if people know it , but you can kayak Lake Union , where Tom Hanks lived on a houseboat in Sleepless in Seattle . Try the Northwest Outdoor Center-it 's a place that rents kayaks . " He makes it sound easy : " You set your kayak in the water , ease yourself in , and paddle by the houseboats , Gas Works Park , the Kalakala-a 1930s ferryboat that looks like a big toaster . " Radke 's also high on 512-acre Discovery Park in Seattle 's Magnolia neighborhood . " It 's on a bluff overlooking Elliott Bay . The view of the water and the mountains is unbelievable , " he says . " You can walk down to the beach at low tide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bluff-there are a lot of walking trails . Ditch Seattle 's urbanity here and feel the wildness of the Northwest . It 's the closest thing Seattle gets to remoteness . It 's a real deal . " DINING FAVORITES IN THIS FOOD FESTIVAL OF A TOWN YOU HEAR MATT JANKE 'S restaurant before you see it . Matt 's in the Market is a plate-clanking , cork-popping operation shoehorned into a space two flights above the market hubbub of Pike and Pine Streets . Janke and his chef , Erik Cannella , scarcely have room to steam a mussel , but that does n't stop Seattle from crowding the nine-seat counter and filling up his five tables . The draw is , of course , his fresh Northwest ingredients-Janke sources his produce , fish , and meat downstairs at the Market . As the lunch rush ebbs , he serves up a list of his favorite local restaurants , starting with Monsoon on Capitol Hill . " It 's a brother and two sisters who came here from Vietnam in the late ' 70s . They do great crab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine list is strong on Alsatian whites . " Salumi , an Italian meat-and-sausage lunchtime place in Pioneer Square opened by Armandino Batali , a retired Boeing engineer , is another favorite . " Sit at the communal tables with everybody else . And do n't be daunted by the line at the door . Two-thirds of those people are getting food to go . " Also in Pioneer Square is Cafe Paloma , a " great place run by a charming Turkish gentleman . " The menu ranges from panini sandwiches and salads ( lunch ) to full meals ( dinner ) . " My nice-sit-down-dinner place is Marco 's Supperclub . The menu 's eclectic , with choices ranging from Jamaican jerk chicken to great seafood , " Janke continues . His last pick is a venerable local favorite : Wild Ginger . " You get lots of good curries like beef and lamb , sea bass in lettuce leaf , squid dusted with salt and pepper and then flash fried-usually in a wok-and fantastic wines . " HOTELS WATER VIEWS AND OTHER NEWS SIPPING ONE OF THE FAMOUS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Park Hotel ) , Shannon O'Leary-editor of the popular Best Places Seattle , a guide-book appreciated by locals and visitors alike-shares her thoughts on the city 's most noteworthy accommodations . Her first choice lies in the city icon , Pike Place . " The Inn at the Market remains one of my favorites , " she says . " It 's a classic Seattle experience , romantic , and close to everything you might want to see . " Most of the 70 rooms have a water view . The hotel even played a part in the movie Sleepless in Seattle . What about a place where service takes center stage ? O'Leary answers at once : " The Fairmont Olympic Hotel , formerly the Four Seasons Olympic , " she declares . " It 's a pampering hotel-but it 's also family oriented . It 's Seattle 's glitz hotel in the old tradition of glitz-not in the boutique-hotel sense . It 's the Michelle Pfeiffer of hotels . A little bit classy , a little bit icy-but in a good way . And it 's the place in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with an entirely different mood is the Sorrento . " It 's on First Hill , in its own little corner of the world , " O'Leary says . " It 's Italian in spirit , very warm and luxurious but earthy , with beautiful landscaping . " If you 're looking for a bargain , the Pensione Nichols is the place for style and value , " O'Leary continues . " It 's bohemian , filled with antiques and interesting guests . In some ways , it 's like staying in someone 's home . If you 're comfortable in a B &B; environment , you 'll like the Nichols . Plus it 's known for its great breakfasts . " A neoclassical Craftsman-style B &B; in a cozy Seattle neighborhood is where O'Leary puts visiting friends and family . " Chelsea Station has personality , kitchenettes , and a neighborhood feel . It 's north of Fremont , on the edge of Woodland Park , " she says . " It 's a homey place that 's out of the fray of the city-yet just a taxi ride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ information for the sights , services , and establishments featured in this story appear in our Traveler 's Sourcebook on page 119 .
