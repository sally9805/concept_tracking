Call it the Aud Hep Story . Even with three hours at its disposal , this film ends halfway through the star 's career and life , with the making of Breakfast at Tiffany 's . No My Fair Lady or Charade ; nothing of the work for UNICEF . Still , what 's onscreen fascinates because of the life itself and , at bottom , because of the dead-on impersonation by Jennifer Love Hewitt . Hepburn 's accent ; her posture ; her chin-down , eyebrows-up way with a line  --  Hewitt has it all , and charm to boot . Delicious . <P>  --  By William Tynan
