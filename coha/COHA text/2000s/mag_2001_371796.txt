The man asleep in Mullah Mohammed Omar 's bed in Kandahar had a machine gun next to him , but I decided to wake him anyway . Was he dreaming of the spiritual leader of the Taliban , now turned fugitive ? A growl came back in reply . " I 'm too tired to dream , " he said before covering his head with a wool blanket . <P> I glanced around the room . The bed is small , considering that Omar has three wives . He fled as soon as the U.S. started bombing Kandahar  --  leaving behind a few mementos : a poster of the Medina mosque , some syrupy medicine , and the word Allah painted in gold and black on glass , framed and hanging above the bed . The house is decorated with plastic bedroom chandeliers and sentimental frescoes of waterfalls . It does n't quite fit the urbane tastes of Hamid Karzai , Afghanistan 's interim Prime Minister . " You should see the place , " Karzai had said , rolling his eyes . But Karzai well knows the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visionary who conversed with the Prophet in his dreams . That 's why a common sentry snoozes in Omar 's bed . <P> The other legend being dismantled is Osama bin Laden 's . He lived in a fortress the locals called the Wolves ' Frontier , set up near Kandahar airport . Defended to the death by his fighters , it was pounded by U.S. bombs . Its remains mix domesticity and terror : kids ' swing sets , a deep bunker , four stallions and a wheat field where bin Laden experimented with American grains to find one suited to the parched Afghan desert . From his two-story office he could watch trainees grunting their way under barbed wire . It 's all debris now , along with dented tea trays and broken dolls . And a few cruel parting gifts : last week a Pakistani journalist kicked a boot in the ruin , and a mine hidden underneath blew off his leg and most of his face .
