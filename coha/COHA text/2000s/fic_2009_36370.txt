The bloody handprint was gone , wiped from Kisten 's window but not from my memory , and it ticked me off that someone had cleaned it , as if they were trying to steal what little recollection I retained about the night he 'd died . The anger was misplaced fear if I was honest with myself . But I was n't . Most days it was better that way . <p> Stifling a shiver from the December chill that had taken the abandoned cruiser , now in dry dock rather than floating on the river , I stood in the tiny kitchen and stared at the milky plastic as if willing the smeared mark back into existence . In the near distance came the overindulgent , powerful huff of a diesel train crossing the Ohio River . The scrape of Ford 's shoes on the metallic boarding ladder was harsh , and worry pinched my brow . <p> The Federal Inderland Bureau had officially closed the investigation into Kisten 's murder  --  Inderland Security had n't even opened one  --  but the FIB would n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That meant intelligent , awkward Ford , since Edden thought I needed more psychiatric evaluation and I would n't come in anymore . Not since I fell asleep on the couch and everyone in the FIB 's Cincinnati office had heard me snoring . I did n't need evaluation . What I needed was something  --  anything  --  to rebuild my memory . If it was a bloody handprint , then so be it . <p> " Rachel ? Wait for me , " the FIB 's psychiatrist called , shifting my worry to annoyance . Like I ca n't handle this ? I 'm a big girl . Besides , there was n't anything left to see ; the FIB had cleaned everything up . Ford had obviously been out here earlier  --  given the ladder and the unlocked door  --  making sure everything was sufficiently tidy before our appointment . <p> The clatter of dress shoes on teak pushed me forward , and I untangled my arms from themselves and reached for the tiny galley table for balance as I headed to the living room . The floor was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framing the now-clean window were the dirty gray and brilliant blue tarps of boats at dry dock , the ground a good six feet below us . <p> " Will you hold up ? " Ford asked again , the light eclipsing as he entered . " I ca n't help if you 're a room away . " <p> " I 'm waiting , " I grumbled , coming to a halt and tugging my shoulder bag up . Though he 'd tried to hide it , Ford had some difficulty getting his butt up the ladder . I thought the idea of a psychiatrist afraid of heights was hilarious , until the amulet he wore around his neck turned a bright pink when I mentioned it and Ford went red with embarrassment . He was a good man with his own demons to circle . He did n't deserve my razzing . <p> Ford 's breathing slowed in the chill silence . Wan but determined , he gripped the table , his face whiter than usual , which made his short black hair stand out and his brown eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I appreciated his wading through my emotional crap to help me piece together what had happened . <p> I gave him a thin smile , and Ford undid the top few buttons of his coat to reveal a professional cotton shirt and the amulet he wore while working . The metallic ley line charm was a visual display of the emotions he was picking up . He felt the emotions whether he was wearing the charm or not , but those around him had at least the illusion of privacy when he took it off . Ivy , my roommate and business partner , thought it stupid to try to break witch magic with human psychology in order to recover my memory , but I was desperate . Her efforts to find out who had killed Kisten were getting nowhere . <p> Ford 's relief at being surrounded by walls was almost palpable , and seeing him release his death grip on the table , I headed for the narrow door to the living room and the rest of the boat . The faint scent of vampire and pasta brushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been five months . <p> My jaw clenched , and I kept my eyes on the floor , not wanting to see the broken door frame . There were smudges of dirt on the low-mat carpet that had n't been there before , marks left by careless people who did n't know Kisten , had never known his smile , the way he laughed , or the way his eyes crinkled up when he surprised me . Technically an Inderland death without human involvement was out of the FIB 's jurisdiction , but since the I.S. did n't care that my boyfriend had been turned into a blood gift , the FIB had made an effort just for me . <p> Murder was never taken off the books , but the investigation had been officially shelved . This was the first chance I 'd had to come out here to try to rekindle my memory . Someone had nicked the inside of my lip trying to bind me to them . Someone had murdered my boyfriend twice . Someone was going to be in a world of hurt when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked past Ford to the window where the bloody handprint had been , left like a signpost to mock my pain without giving any prints to follow . Coward . <p> The amulet around Ford 's neck flashed to an angry black . His eyes met mine as his eyebrows rose , and I forced my emotions to slow . I could n't remember crap . Jenks , my backup and other business partner , had dosed me into forgetting so I would n't go after Kisten 's murderer . I could n't blame him . The pixy was only four inches tall , and it had been his only option to keep me from killing myself on a suicide run . I was a witch with an unclaimed vampire bite , and that could n't stand up to an undead vampire no matter how you sliced it . <p> " You sure you 're up to this ? " Ford asked , and I forced my hand down from my upper arm . Again . It throbbed with a pain long since gone as a memory tried to surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other side of the door and trying to break it down was an old one . It was nearly the only memory I had of that night . <p> <br> Continues ...
