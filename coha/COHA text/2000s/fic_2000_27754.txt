IMMACULE MAKERI I Envy Hutu women one thing . They can eat meat . I must admit some of us Tutsi women do too , but it is n't right and my husband , also of a good clan , would be ashamed of me if I did . Even so , now , as I knead the sorghum dough , I can smell from the opposite hill the wind-driven smoky odor of meat cooking . Tonight the Hutu women over there will sink their teeth into strong-tasting red meat , while I sit here over sorghum porridge and beans . If I told those Hutu women that I , a Tutsi of good blood , envied them anything , what would they think ? That I had gone mad ? What would that nice Hutu girl think , the one who once bandaged my son 's cut and smiles at me each time we meet on a path ? She 's pretty , if short and rounded in a Hutu way . What would she think of a Tutsi woman who admitted envy of a Hutu ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My husband is a cattle owner in Butare prfecture with standards to uphold , and I have seven children whose mother 's reputation is important to them . My eldest son studies in France , the next at the national university in Butare , my girl of eighteen will marry within the year , then comes twelve-year-old Innocent , whom I nearly lost to fever in his infancy and so , secretly , is my favorite , and then the girl of seven , the boy of five . Two years ago , when I considered myself beyond childbearing , I was blessed with a baby boy who has been baptized by our Catholic priest and awarded a legal birth certificate by the government . For such children I must look and act the part of a Tutsi mother and wife , even if circumstances have changed terribly since I was a girl . I still love our rugo , our compound of five buildings on this most beautiful of hills overlooking the valleys of the most beautiful of lands , for everyone knows that Rwanda is God 's country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day , at night , always he returns here . But sometimes I wonder if he has forgotten the Tutsi , his chosen people , his favorite of favorites . In my grandmother 's day a Tutsi woman like myself would never find anything to envy in a Hutu . The idea would not have occurred to her . She would have been too proud of her position to think of eating meat . I am ashamed of myself . And I am sorry for my husband , who has never reconciled himself to the loss of Tutsi power . After bringing in the cattle for the day , he drinks with his friends and often stumbles home drunk . I wish he could see things for what they are . After all , Imana and Jesus have preordained everything that happens . We must do our best and accept what fate gives us . That 's what I try to explain to my good husband . I tell him almost every day that he 's still a patron to Hutu clients , that he rents them his cattle so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the cattle will never be theirs . My husband is aware of being less than his father , who ruled his pastureland like a king . Each month my husband 's father had his clients come bow to him when they paid for the use of his cattle . Now our former Tutsi king ca n't even visit his ancestral land . They say he lives the life of an outcast , corrupted by whites in a white country , and frolics in the warm sea with naked women . Does my husband envy him ? My husband used to compare my beauty to the glory of his favorite cattle , almost as if he were a court poet , an umusizi , in the service of a Tutsi king . My husband used to say his friends envied him for the way I gave him good children . And it 's true , I paid back in fertility his bride-price of cattle . He 'd never have to consider the old saying that the worst thing known to man is to lack children to mourn him . Imana has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the help of the White Fathers in their mission house . I was almost finished with the dough and getting the smell of cooked meat out of my nose when Innocent came in to ask for something . I shook my head and said nothing , because it 's bad luck to speak while preparing sorghum dough . It 's all right to speak while preparing maize but not sorghum dough . His eyes were bright while he panted and poked the air with his toy spear . He must have come from playing with the Hutu boy on the next hill . In the old days when we Tutsi were the warriors and they our servants , the Hutu would never touch a spear without permission . Now their children are teaching ours to be fierce . I gave Innocent a warning look that had him backing out of the house with downcast eyes . Later on , when the dough is finished , I will speak to him again about remembering the past . I do n't want him to forget the splendor of our people when Imana brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful hills to rule as they pleased . But perhaps I 'm asking too much of a twelve-year-old . Some people say the glory of our Tutsi past should be forgotten . They say it only makes things worse to remember . After all , thirty years ago many of our people left this country in fear , and for all these years the Hutu have been in charge . Or thought they were in charge . It is all so difficult to understand . When I see boys playing with toy spears and jabbing at one another with glee , I worry that someday their play will change to real violence . We have seen too much of it in our beautiful hills . A man dead by the side of the road , his throat cut with a panga as if he were a goat . Two brothers hacked down in their pastureland . Whole families murdered . A massacre of ten here , of fifty in a nearby sous-prfecture . Year after year the numbers grow . Confusion , accusations , and more hatred . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come here to drink , I overhear them talk about such things . They discuss the civil war that has been going on for almost four years now . Tutsi refugees from Uganda crossed the border and started it all , although they have n't got very far . From what I know they stay mostly in the north and hide in the mists of gorilla forests . All they do is come out for raids that annoy the government . Even so , my husband and his friends are proud of this little war , perhaps because it gives them hope for a Tutsi victory some day . Fortunately , my two eldest boys think more of education than they do of war , and Innocent has the cleverness of someone twice his age . But what of the five-year-old ? Already he begs to go with Innocent when the boys play war . And the little fellow of two ? These questions make me secretly hope that the Tutsi soldiers from Uganda will go back to that place and give up causing trouble here . Our country is so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Hutu farmers , and Tutsi cattlemen like my husband make daily trips into pastureland with their longhorns . We all eat well , Tutsi and Hutu , and the smoke of our cooking fires mingles in the wonderful air breathed out of the divine mouth of Imana . But these are thoughts I keep to myself when my husband comes home . They say a hen must n't crow when the rooster appears . It was late when it happened and all the children had eaten and gone to sleep , but my husband still had n't , come home . He was drinking in a beer shop somewhere with his friends . So I sat under the electric , lightbulb and did some sewing on a new raffia basket . I like to do close , even work . I make complicated designs with dyes just to challenge myself . No change is possible after beginning with colored designs . I 'm proud of my coiled work . There was a program of Ethiopian music on the radio that I was half listening to when a voice interrupted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plane crash tonight under mysterious circumstances . I put down my awl . Some kind of missile had shot the plane down and all aboard were killed , including a French crew of three and the leader of Burundi . President Habyarimana dead . Who killed him ? Tutsi ? Hutu ? Tutsi ? Perhaps we Tutsi would be blamed for the death of a Hutu president . I looked at a Kenyan calendar pinned on the wall . Sixth of April , 1994 . If this date was special in the mind of Imana , our lives would be changed by it . Six has often been a special number for me . I was married on the sixth day of the sixth month . Someone once told me that six was Imana 's favorite number . But favorite could mean important , not good . So the sixth of April could mean the day when important bad things began for us all . I wanted my husband to come home , but surely the moon was going to be much higher before he staggered back into the rugo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
