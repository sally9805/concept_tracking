Chapter One My name is Bruno Salvador . My friends call me Salvo , so do my enemies . Contrary to what anybody may tell you , I am a citizen in good standing of the United Kingdom and Northern Ireland , and by profession a top interpreter of Swahili and the lesser-known but widely spoken languages of the Eastern Congo , formerly under Belgian rule , hence my mastery of French , a further arrow in my professional quiver . I am a familiar face around the London law courts both civil and criminal , and in regular demand at conferences on Third World matters , see my glowing references from many of our nation 's finest corporate names . Due to my special skills I have also been called upon to do my patriotic duty on a confidential basis by a government department whose existence is routinely denied . I have never been in trouble , I pay my taxes regularly , have a healthy credit rating and am the owner of a well-conducted bank account . Those are cast-iron facts that no amount of bureaucratic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six years of honest labour in the world of commerce I have applied my services - be it by way of cautiously phrased conference calls or discreet meetings in neutral cities on the European continent - to the creative adjustment of oil , gold , diamond , mineral and other commodity prices , not to mention the diversion of many millions of dollars from the prying eyes of the world 's shareholders into slush funds as far removed as Panama , Budapest and Singapore . Ask me whether , in facilitating these transactions , I felt obliged to consult my conscience and you will receive the emphatic answer , ' No . ' The code of your top interpreter is sacrosanct . He is not hired to indulge his scruples . He is pledged to his employer in the same manner as a soldier is pledged to the flag . In deference to the world 's unfortunates , however , it is also my practice to make myself available on a pro bono basis to London hospitals , prisons and the immigration authorities despite the fact that the remuneration in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list at number 17 , Norfolk Mansions , Prince of Wales Drive , Battersea , South London , a desirable freehold property of which I am the minority co-owner together with my legal wife Penelope - never call her Penny - an upper-echelon Oxbridge journalist four years my senior and , at the age of thirty-two , a rising star in the firmament of a mass-market British tabloid capable of swaying millions . Penelope 's father is the senior partner of a blue-chip City law firm and her mother a major force in her local Conservative Party . We married five years ago on the strength of a mutual physical attraction , plus the understanding that she would get pregnant as soon as her career permitted , owing to my desire to create a stable nuclear family complete with mother along conventional British lines . The convenient moment has not , however , presented itself , due to her rapid rise within the paper and other factors . Our union was not in all regards orthodox . Penelope was the elder daughter of an all-white Surrey family in high professional standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natural son of a bog Irish Roman Catholic missionary and a Congolese village woman whose name has vanished for ever in the ravages of war and time . I was born , to be precise , behind the locked doors of a Carmelite convent in the town of Kisangani , or Stanleyville as was , being delivered by nuns who had vowed to keep their mouths shut , which to anybody but me sounds funny , surreal or plain invented . But to me it 's a biological reality , as it would be for you if at the age of ten you had sat at your saintly father 's bedside in a Mission house in the lush green highlands of South Kivu in the Eastern Congo , listening to him sobbing his heart out half in Norman French and half in Ulsterman 's English , with the equatorial rain pounding like elephant feet on the green tin roof and the tears pouring down his fever-hollowed cheeks so fast you 'd think the whole of Nature had come indoors to join the fun . Ask a Westerner where Kivu is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ask an African and he will tell you , ' Paradise , ' for such it is : a Central African land of misted lakes and volcanic mountains , emerald pastureland , luscious fruit groves and similar . In his seventieth and last year of life my father 's principal worry was whether he had enslaved more souls than he had liberated . The Vatican 's African missionaries , according to him , were caught in a perpetual cleft stick between what they owed to life and what they owed to Rome , and I was part of what he owed to life , however much his spiritual Brothers might resent me . We buried him in the Swahili language , which was what he 'd asked for , but when it fell to me to read ' The Lord is my Shepherd ' at his graveside , I gave him my very own rendering in Shi , his favourite among all the languages of the Eastern Congo for its vigour and flexibility . Illegitimate sons-in-law of mixed race do not merge naturally into the social fabric of wealthy Surrey , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ truism . In a favourable light , I used to tell myself when I was growing up , I look more suntanned Irish than mid-brown Afro , plus my hair is straight not crinkly , which goes a long way if you 're assimilating . But that never fooled Penelope 's mother or her fellow wives at the golf club , her worst nightmare being that her daughter would produce an all-black grandchild on her watch , which may have accounted for Penelope 's reluctance to put matters to the test , although in retrospect I am not totally convinced of this , part of her motive in marrying me being to shock her mother and upstage her younger sister . A word here regarding my dear late father 's life struggle will not be deemed out of place . His entry into the world , he confided to me , had been no smoother than my own . Born in 1917 to a corporal in the Royal Ulster Fusiliers and a fourteen-year-old Normandy peasant girl who happened to be passing at the time , he spent his childhood on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in northern France , until by dint of study plus his inherited bilinguality he clawed himself a place in a Junior Seminary in the wilds of County Donegal and thus set his young feet unthinkingly on the path to God . Sent to France for the greater refinement of his faith , he endured without complaint interminable years of gruelling instruction in Catholic theology , but as soon as the Second World War broke out he grabbed the nearest bicycle , which with Irish wit he assured me was the property of a godless Protestant , and pedalled hell for leather across the Pyrenees to Lisbon . Stowing away on a tramper bound for Leopoldville as was , he evaded the attentions of a colonial government ill disposed towards stray white missionaries , and attached himself to a remote community of friars dedicated to bringing the One True Faith to the two hundred-odd tribes of the Eastern Congo , an ambitious commitment at any time . Those who now and then have accused me of impulsiveness need look no further than my dear late father on his heretic 's pushbike . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his own , he baked bricks and limed them with red mud trodden by his own feet , dug ditches in the hillside and installed latrines amid the banana groves . Next came the building : first the church , then the school with its twin bell tower , then the Mother Mary Clinic , then the fish-ponds and fruit and vegetable plantations to supply them , such being his true vocation as a peasant in a region lavishly endowed with Nature 's riches whether you are talking cassava , papaya , maize , soya beans , quinine , or Kivu 's wild strawberries which are the best in the world bar none . After all this came the Mission house itself , and behind the Mission house a low brick hostel with small windows high up for Mission servants . In God 's name he trekked hundreds of kilometres to remote patelins and mining settlements , never failing when opportunity arose to add another language to his ever-growing collection until a day when he returned to his Mission to find his fellow priests fled , the cows , goats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the hospital pillaged , its nurses hamstrung , raped and slaughtered , and himself a prisoner of the last rag-tag elements of the fearsome Simba , a murderous rabble of misguided revolutionists whose sole aim , until their official extinction a few years previously , had been to visit death and mayhem on all perceived agents of colonisation , which could be anyone nominated by themselves , or by the guiding spirits of their long-deceased warrior ancestors . As a general principle , it is true , the Simba stopped short of harming white priests , fearing that by doing so they would break the dawa that rendered themselves immune to flying bullets . In the case of my dear late father , however , his captors were quick to set aside their reservations , arguing that since he spoke their language as well as they did , he was plainly a black devil in disguise . Of his fortitude in captivity many inspiring anecdotes were later told . Whipped repeatedly in order to expose the true colour of his devil 's skin , tortured and forced to witness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's forgiveness for his tormentors . Whenever able , he went among his fellow prisoners , administering the Sacrament . Yet not the Holy Church in all its wisdom could have been prepared for the cumulative effect on him of these privations . Mortification of the flesh , we are taught , furthers the triumph of the spirit . Such however was not the case for my dear late father , who within months of his release had demonstrated the flaw in this convenient theory , and not merely with my dear late mother : If there is divine purpose to your conception , son , he confided to me on his deathbed , resorting to his lovely Irish brogue lest his fellow priests should overhear him through the floorboards , it is to be found in that stinking prison hut and at the whipping post . The thought that I might die without knowing the consolation of a woman 's body was the one torture I could not bear . Her reward for producing me was as cruel as it was unjust . At my father 's urging she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving birth to me among her clan and tribe . But these were turbulent times for the Congo or , as General Mobutu insisted it be known , Zaire . In the name of Authenticity , foreign priests had been expelled for the crime of baptising babies with Western names , schools had been forbidden to teach the life of Jesus , and Christmas declared a normal working day . It was therefore not surprising that the elders of my mother 's village baulked at the prospect of nurturing a white missionary 's love-child whose presence among them could invite instant retribution , and accordingly sent the problem back to where it came from . But the Mission Fathers were as reluctant as the village elders to receive us , referring my mother instead to a distant convent where she arrived with only hours to spare before my birth . Three months of tough love at the hands of the Carmelites were more than enough for her . Reasoning that they were better placed than she to provide me with a future , she consigned me to their mercy and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roof , crept back to her kin and family , who weeks afterwards were massacred in their entirety by an aberrant tribe , right down to my last grandparent , uncle , cousin , distant aunt and half- brother or sister . A village headman 's daughter , son , my father whispered through his tears , when I pressed him for details that might assist me in forming a mental picture of her to sustain me in my later years . I had taken shelter under his roof . She cooked our food and brought me the water to wash with . It was the generosity of her that overwhelmed me . He had eschewed the pulpit by then , and had no appetite for verbal pyrotechnics . Nevertheless the memory rekindled the Irishman 's smouldering rhetorical fires : As tall as you 'll be one day , son ! As beautiful as all creation ! How in God 's name can they tell me you were born in sin ? You were born in love , my son ! There is no sin but hate ! The retribution meted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ draconian than my mother 's , but severe . One year in a Jesuit rehab penitentiary outside Madrid , two more as a worker-priest in a Marseilles slum , and only then back to the Congo he so unwisely loved . And how he swung it I do n't know , and probably God does n't either , but somewhere along his stony path he persuaded the Catholic orphanage that had custody of me to give me up to him . Thereafter the half-caste bastard who was Salvo trailed after him in the care of servants chosen for their age and ugliness , first in the guise of offspring of a deceased uncle , later as acolyte and server , until that fateful night of my tenth birthday when , conscious as much of his mortality as my ripening , he poured out his very human heart to me as described above , which I regarded , and still do , as the greatest compliment a father can pay to his accidental son . The years following my dear late father 's death did not pass smoothly for the orphaned Salvo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my continued presence among them as a festering affront , hence my Swahili nickname of mtoto wa siri or secret child . Africans maintain that we derive our spirit from our father and our blood from our mother , and that was my problem in a nutshell . Had my dear late father been black , I might have been tolerated as excess baggage . But he was white through and through , whatever the Simba might have thought , and Irish with it , and white missionaries , it is well known , do not engender babies on the side . The secret child might serve at priests ' table and the altar , and attend their schools but , come the approach of an ecclesiastical dignitary of whatever colour , he was whisked to the Mission workers ' hostel to be hidden until the threat blew over , which is neither to disparage the Brethren for their high-mindedness , nor to blame them for the occasionally excessive warmth of their regard . Unlike my dear late father , they had restricted themselves to their own gender when addressing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who lavished more attention on me than I could comfortably accommodate , or Pre Franois , who liked to think of Andr as his chosen friend and took umbrage at this flowering of affection . In our Mission school , meanwhile , I enjoyed neither the deference shown to our smattering of white children nor the comradeship owed me by my native peers . Little wonder then if I gravitated naturally towards the Mission servants ' low brick hostel which , unbeknown to the Fathers , was the true hub of our community , the natural sanctuary for any passing traveller , and the trading point of oral information for miles around . And it was there , curled up unnoticed on a wood pallet beside the brick chimney-breast , that I listened spellbound to the tales of itinerant huntsmen , witch doctors , spell-sellers , warriors and elders , scarcely venturing a word of my own for fear of being packed off to bed . It was there also that my ever- growing love of the Eastern Congo 's many languages and dialects took root . Hoarding them as my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and refined them , storing them in my head as protection from I knew not what perils , pestering native and missionary alike for a nugget of vernacular or turn of phrase . In the privacy of my tiny cell I composed my own childish dictionaries by candlelight . Soon , these magic puzzle-pieces became my identity and refuge , the private sphere that nobody could take away from me and only the few enter . And I have often wondered , as I wonder now , what course the secret child 's life might have taken , had I been permitted to continue along this solitary and ambivalent path : and whether the pull of my mother 's blood might have turned out to be stronger than my father 's spirit . The question remains academic , however , since my dear late father 's former brethren were energetically conspiring to be rid of me . My accusing skin colour , my versatility in languages , my cocky Irish manner and worst of all the good looks that , according to the Mission servants , I owed to my mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continues ... )
