1 <br> Present Day <br> " My God , " Michael Rose murmured . He 'd been off in another world , thinking about that day five years past when he and Sheila had been arrested at Dulles airport . Thinking about how deeply it had affected his life , how it had shaken his faith in his government . How it had taken a year to get to the truth behind what had happened . " Amazing . " <br> David Cortez glanced up , following his boss 's line of sight . Cortez had been about to pick up his beer off the smooth , dark-wood bar but stopped with the chilled glass halfway to his lips . " Jesus , " he said softly with a hint of a Cuban accent . <br> Rose tried not to stare , but he could n't help himself . He 'd spent an entire career keeping his nose an inch from the grindstone , doing the right thing , shunning the temptations that were constantly swirling around him as he climbed higher and higher on Trafalgar 's corporate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's perfect . " <br> " Yeah , she is , " Cortez agreed . <br> The young woman sat on a tall stool on the other side of the bar , a glass of champagne on the napkin in front of her . She was keeping two young professionals in sharp suits and bright ties occupied without even trying . Both of them were doing everything but juggling to get her attention , but she was playing them off against each other beautifully . Touching their arms lightly , smiling at them demurely with her full , glossy lips . It was an incredible smile . She was an incredible woman . <br> " I need to meet her . " <br> Cortez turned toward Rose . " Easy , Mike , " he warned . They 'd worked together since Rose had been promoted to chief financial officer , and they 'd gotten very close after a lot of late nights at the office . After a lot of Chinese takeout , a lot of black coffee , a lot of good-nights to the kids over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone else , Cortez knew how vulnerable Rose was right now . " We 're almost to the finish line , we 've got ta stay focused . " <br> But Rose kept staring . Mid to late twenties , he guessed . Old enough to be worldly , young enough to be impressionable . Not from or with money , either . From where he sat , that engagement diamond on her left hand looked like a microchip  --  less than a third of a carat , probably closer to a quarter  --  and her low-cut blouse was straight off a rounder rack at Sears . He watched as the man who he assumed was her husband cut aggressively between the two professionals and kissed her . Watched her react with a kiss of familiarity . A kiss devoid of passion . Watched the two suitors fade into the crowd , disappointment etched into their expressions . Then felt disappointment sink into his own chest . Which was surprising , and frightening , for several reasons . <br> " Yeah , " Rose agreed quietly . He 'd heard about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 'd just never thought it could strike him . Especially now when he was on the lookout for it . " I guess you 're right . " <br> Then it happened : They caught each other 's gaze , and it momentarily paralyzed him . Her eyes were like lasers cutting through the cigar smoke , low light , and noise . Sparkling beams the color of Caribbean water on a postcard locking onto him and not letting him go , blacking out everything else around them . Rose was the number two executive at Trafalgar Industries , chief financial officer of one of the biggest companies in the world , a corporate superstar at forty-three . But suddenly he felt like an awkward , pimply kid at a high school dance . She was even more attractive than he 'd first thought , and not just physically . She had a startling genuineness about her that shone through the potent sexuality . It was a one-two combination he 'd never encountered , and he was back on his heels . God , what a risk this would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> Rose put his elbows on the bar , covered his face with his hands and rubbed his forehead with his fingertips , wondering where Sheila was . When he 'd called home an hour ago , the au pair had told him that his wife had left the house at noon but had n't been back or called since . He checked his watch : eight o'clock . Maybe it was finally time to hire a private detective . <br> " Mike . " <br> " Yeah , yeah . " Rose glanced across the bar , but the young woman and her husband were gone , presumably headed into the adjoining Morton 's Restaurant , one of the best steak houses in northern Virginia . He looked over at Cortez . " You committed to this acquisition , David ? You committed to getting CIS ? " <br> Cortez nodded . <br> " A hundred percent ? " <br> " Absolutely , Mike . " <br> Rose nodded encouragingly , trying to shake the image of the woman from his mind . But that was impossible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
