<p> When Adam Ravetch was training to be an underwater cinematographer during the ' 80s , he always looked up to the generations of wildlife photographers before him for inspiration . <p> Guys like Chuck Nicklin , Al Giddings , Stan Waterman and Peter Gimbel reached rock-star status in Ravetch 's world . <p> " Peter Gimbel did ' Blue Water , White Death ' in the ' 60s . It was one of the first films to capture the great white shark on camera - way before anyone knew it could be done , " the soft-spoken Ravetch says , raising his voice slightly in excitement . " These guys did stuff in the wild that people assumed would get you killed or eaten while filming . These were my heroes . " <p> Naturally , when someone warned Ravetch that a walrus could - within seconds - decapitate him and suck his brains out , Ravetch knew he 'd finally found the animal he was meant to film . <p> The result : " Arctic Tale , " a documentary that takes the best of 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climate-changing Arctic . While there were moments when Ravetch and his co-director and wife , Sarah Robertson , went a little loopy waiting weeks to capture 30 seconds of action , fortunately they did n't lose their heads . <p> With a supporting cast of walruses , polar bears , foxes , seals , whales and a villain known as global warming , " Arctic Tale " brings the Earth 's refrigerator to life in ways that few documentaries have before . <p> " We wanted to make a new genre of film , " Ravetch says of " Arctic Tale , " which mixes the fictional lives of a polar bear cub and a walrus pup with real footage . " With a typical documentary , there 's a lot of information thrown at the audience with the best footage of animals . We wanted to emotionally move people . We wanted people to feel a connection with the plight of two animals and their journeys . We wanted to tell a story . " <p> " Arctic Tale " follows Seela , the walrus , and Nanu , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ melting Arctic . While the filmmakers used multiple animals for the two main characters , the audience can easily suspend any skepticism thanks to the consistent story line narrated by Queen Latifah . <p> Despite the new approach , Ravetch and Robertson were determined to keep their film as authentic as possible by supporting its message with science . <p> Often their footage challenged conventional science . <p> Before beginning filming , Ravetch went to a museum in his hometown of Los Angeles . There , he got behind the glass case filled with stuffed walruses and measured them . His plan was to build a cage for underwater filming , and he wanted to know how big the bars should be so that he could swim out of the cage but a walrus ' head-smashing tusks could be kept out . <p> On his first journey nearly 15 years ago , Ravetch and his crew dropped the cage in the water and watched the walruses immediately ram it - and their boat - perpetuating the myth that walruses are killers . <p> " My jaw dropped open and I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyway . <p> To signal an emergency , Ravetch was to yank on a yellow chain tied to a buoy . During that first dive , the walruses swam right toward him to check him out . Spooked , Ravetch tripped over the camera , pulled the emergency chain and was hauled out of the water . <p> " Everyone was saying , ' What happened ? What happened ? ' I said , ' Oh , nothing . Just got a little scared , ' " Ravetch says with a smile . " That happened two more times . The third time my wife said , ' Oh , just leave him down there . ' " <p> Ravetch and his crew soon ditched the cage after realizing that the walruses were not interested in biting his head off . The animals were too busy worrying about their own . <p> Science said polar bears and walruses rarely interacted . So when members of the movie crew found themselves in the middle of a showdown between a fierce male polar bear and a herd of walruses , they screamed at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Afterward we thought , ' What did we just do ? We had the perfect natural setup to film , ' " Ravetch says . " We did n't understand bears at the time . And we did n't think that a polar bear would be interested in a walrus . " <p> Normally bears would n't be . But normally there would be more ice to allow the two species to go their separate ways , as they have for thousands of years . That 's all changing because of global warming . <p> Areas of ice that were n't supposed to be accessible to the film crew until late August were suddenly reachable in June . This forced polar bears and walruses to seek food and shelter on small islands , stranding them together 200 miles away from their typical habitats . <p> The Inuit people , who have lived and hunted in the area for thousands of years , told Ravetch that the climate change is unlike anything they 've ever witnessed or been told of by their ancestors . <p> " The Inuit are saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he says . " They 're seeing more seals born on top of the ice because there is not enough snow . There are insects coming up that they do n't have Inuit words for , and birds they 've never seen . " <p> With Latifah 's cool tone and occasional pop songs from Ben Harper , Aimee Mann and Sister Sledge , " Arctic Tale " depicts the consequences of global warming without being preachy . <p> During the past 15 years of traveling back and forth to the Arctic , taking his children along with him , Ravetch has seen changes there that include a haze of smog imported from Europe . While he does n't expect to end the argument between those who believe in the urgency of global warming and those who do n't , he hopes the film at least encourages viewers to lead more environmentally sustainable lives . <p> " It reminds me of when I was a kid and my grandfather used to say to me as I ran out the door , ' You shut out those lights , ' " Ravetch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an economical thing . But why not live more sustainably ? Not everyone is going to be convinced .
