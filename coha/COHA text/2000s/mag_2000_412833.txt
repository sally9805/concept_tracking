" THE HILLS , DEAR , I 'M THE HILLS . " THIS IS HOW DRAG QUEEN GUSTY broad describes her attire-an enormous blond wig and green skirt festooned with plastic barnyard animals-this pleasant New York evening . Miss Winds an accountant by day ) is just one of nearly 50 costumed fans standing in line at Manhattan 's Ziegfeld Theatre Sept. 6 , waiting to noisily revel in a 35-year-old movie . This " one-of a-kind interactive theatre event " ( as the press release so breathlessly trumpets ) is called Sing-A-Long Sound of Music and is based , of course , on the hugely successful 1965 Oscar-winning musical that just wo n't go away ( In addition to the new DVD release , it 's been recently referenced in everything from The Sixth Sense to Lars von bier 's grim indie melodrama Dancer in the Dark . ) Tonight 's premiere has also brought out a few of the film 's stars , including Kym Karath ( who played young Gretl von Lapp ) ; Charmian Carr ( the 16-year-old Liesl ) ; and Dan " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain popular millionairemaking TV quiz show , the idea for SingA-Long Sound of Music came from England . Since August 1999 , it has been playing twice a week at London 's Prince Charles Cinema ( where it sometimes screens back-to-back with another participatory camp-fest , The Rocky Horror Picture Show ) . Now showing in a handful of other U.K. venues , the still-thriving British run has already sold more than 200,000 tickets . The shovels premise is simple : After officiating a costume contest held before every screening , the evening 's " host " gives a tutorial on how-with the help of subtitles-to best sing along to the film . The audience is further exhorted to hiss gleefully ( at the sight of the convivially conniving Baroness Schraeder ) , cheer lustily ( when Julie Andrews cavorts in the Alps ) , and to loudly direct any and all comments at the screen no matter how offensive . The low-overhead business concept appealed to David J. Foster , a 33-year-old theater producer who caught the sing-along in London and , with visions of yodeling Americans dancing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twentieth Century Fox and the Rodgers &; Hammerstein Organization . " The show is n't about the music or the stars , " he explains , " it 's about the audience . " If a weeklong run this month at the 1,150seat Ziegfeld proves successful , the Australian-born Foster wants to open the show at other venues across America . But first , he must find out if this oddball event has made it across the Atlantic with all its appeal and charm intact . " NOW , THESE ARE MY KIND OF boys , " cracks tonight 's host , 27-year-old Juilliard grad Kate Rigg , as she introduces a leather-clad duo who arrive as a goatherd and his submissive lamb . The evening 's costumes range from predictable ( nuns ) to bizarre ( a glittery , dustthrowing threesome interpreting " silver white winters that melt into springs " ) .

She tells the crowd the correct way to utilize the bagful of props that have been distributed before the show : The sprig of white plastic flowers , for example , should be waved whenever Captain von Trapp sings " Edelweiss , " a swatch of fabric hoisted to remind Maria that those curtains would make for some fine playclothes . Next , they 're taught a variety of hand motions : The " Do-ReMi " scene , in particular , involves gesticulations that would do " N Sync proud . As the film unspools , the crowd , cheerful and enthusiastic , sings the famous opening title tune with brio-and enjoys a true New York moment when , during the nuns ' morning hymns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daunting Latin subtitles . Fullthroated renditions of " My Favorite Things " and " The Lonely Goatherd " deliver the advertised thrills , but even before Captain von Trapp 's heart begins to thaw , the sing-along begins to lose some of its magic . Maybe that 's because , between musical interludes , the crowd is too busy imposing a sexual subtext onto a movie so determinedly wholesome and chaste . " Sleazel ! " someone shouts as the bedraggled eldest daughter crawls into Maria 's bedroom window after her Grated tryst with Rol Cheers follow such goofily charged lines as the Baroness ' " I do give some rather gay parties " and ( with the offer of lemonade ) " Ah , something long and cool , Georg ? " But by the time , nearly four hours into the night , a weary and thinned-out crowd has picked its way through the crags of " Climb Ev'ry Mountain , " it 's clear that something has been lost in the translation . " The British show was on a smaller scale , " says a media @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The theater was shabby , the print was faded , and you could hardly read the lyrics . But there was a feeling that you were part of something very energetic . " ( Those high spirits , it should be pointed out , might 've been fueled by the ale poured out in the Prince Charles lobby . ) Foster insists that the fans now filing into the Ziegfeld are no different from their English counterparts . But the show 's future , like that of any business venture , brings us back to dough . Disney is monitoring the Ziegfeld grosses , looking for encouragement to expand on an already successful limited run of their own sing-along treatment of Mark Poppins .
