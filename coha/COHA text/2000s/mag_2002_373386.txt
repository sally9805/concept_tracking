Too damned often the photos are the last we see of them : school portraits or family snapshots reproduced on blurry newsprint or flickering TV screens . The parents hold up the pictures at press conferences and tell their sad , familiar stories : one minute the child was there  --  in a bedroom , a store , a car seat  --  and then , in the blink of an eye , she was n't . Please help us find her . Call this number . Contact the FBI . And sometimes it works . Someone recognizes the photo  --  the ponytail , the freckles , the wide brown eyes  --  and the stolen child is found and rescued . Sometimes . <P> Lately we have been seeing these pictures everywhere , practically a new one every day , and sometimes at the top of national newscasts that do n't usually feature such stories so prominently . The press coverage cyclone kicked up months ago with the kidnapping and murder of Danielle Van Dam in San Diego , then gained in intensity with the still unsolved disappearance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fiercer with a series of cases from all over the country . So many shocking stories , so suddenly  --  a genuine crime wave or media hysteria ? <P> Or is it that in a time of lurking new risks over which people feel largely powerless  --  terrorist cells in the suburbs , underground Iraqi bioweapons labs  --  a fixation on solvable , specific mysteries is strangely soothing ? The public may not yet have made much of a difference capturing terrorists , but thanks to mass alerts that deputized thousands of citizens at a stroke , it has succeeded in bringing home a child or two . At least it 's something . At least it makes a dent . <P> Exactly how big a dent is hard to know . The statistics on child abductions are unreliable , unable to settle whether such crimes are growing more common or even how widespread they are . The Justice Department estimates that the number of children taken by strangers annually is between 3,000 and 4,000 . The figures are n't firm ; they depend on the vagaries of local police reports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as other things such as rape , depending on the circumstances of the crime . <P> The fear and confusion unleashed by the abduction stories ca n't be expressed as math . Its power is primal , as gripping as an empty crib . Journalists know this : imperiled children mesmerize . There are n't many stories with villains so wholly evil and victims so absolutely undeserving . What 's more , with the adoption by several states of so-called Amber Alerts  --  emergency bulletins named after a murdered Texas girl that can go out , within moments of a snatching , across countless radios , televisions and even electronic highway signs  --  the kidnapping stories have a new immediacy . They call for involvement , not just outrage . They enlist the audience as participants and even potential heroes . Come join the posse . <P> There 's a saying among recovering alcoholics about how addiction reinforces itself : " The man takes a drink , then the drink takes a drink , then the drink takes the man ... " One wonders if the abduction reports are a runaway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and editors , flattening everything else that lies before it : stories of war and preparations for war , of corruption among the elites , of floods and droughts . What , no kidnapped kids this morning ? Well , find some !
