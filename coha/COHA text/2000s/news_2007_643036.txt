<p> As his wedding neared , some 19 years ago , Patric Verrone , now president of the Writers Guild of America West , joined his bride-to-be in a ritual common to show business types . The couple formed a company , one with a clever name : Calloo Callay . <p> " It 's what you say when you slay the Jabberwock , which is what we were attempting to do in Hollywood , " said Mr. Verrone , referring to Lewis Carroll 's verse about a mythical monster . <p> Mr. Verrone will come face to face with the beast in its corporate form this July , as his union and its East Coast counterpart begin what are expected to be exceedingly difficult negotiations with the conglomerates that own the networks and studios . Whether the entertainment business continues to operate as usual over the next year will depend in no small part on how he handles the encounter . <p> For all their complexity , Hollywood labor talks have often boiled down to issues of leadership . This time around , Mr. Verrone  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law , and a taste for crisp white shirts that seem more Benchley than Bochco  --  has helped set a tone of wariness , if not outright anxiety , with his insistence on big solutions . <p> " He 's an absolute straight-shooter ; he 's unafraid , " said Alan Rosenberg , the Screen Actors Guild president , whose own union faces contract talks only months after the writers . " We 're traveling the same path at the same time , and I know there 's a great deal to be afraid of . " <p> Since assuming the Writers Guild presidency 18 months ago , Mr. Verrone has made clear to the industry that he means to reverse trends that have weakened its traditionally strong union structure . He has replaced key members of his union 's professional staff , allied with fellow guilds and laid groundwork for a series of labor-management talks as the writers ' contract nears an end in October , followed eight months later by the industry 's agreements with the Directors Guild of America and the much larger Actors Guild . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the writers began a five-month walkout over residual payments for the foreign sale of television shows , among other issues . The sides now face a potentially deeper dispute . The main areas of contention are the expansion of nonunion work by units of large media conglomerates like Viacom and News Corporation , and the way artists will be compensated for their work for the Web , mobile devices and other technologies still falling into place . <p> Company executives have argued that it is impossible to devise pay formulas for systems that are still in flux . " What the costs are going to be , what the revenues are going to be , we just do n't know , " said J. Nicholas Counter III , president of the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers . <p> But Mr. Verrone is clearly intent on pinning down as much as possible now  --  and on avoiding the kind of arrangements ( like the one regarding home video ) that many in Hollywood 's creative world believe deprived them of rightful gains in the past . <p> " We had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every three years with the companies ; if there 's a bump in the road , we 'll pave it over , ' " Mr. Verrone said of his own union 's past approach . " But nobody was looking forward to actually going out there and repaving the road ahead . " <p> Mr. Verrone 's own road to guild activist went through the unlikely combination of The Harvard Lampoon and law school at Boston College . At The Lampoon , Harvard 's humor magazine , he worked alongside peers who would later populate the ranks of television 's comedy establishment . In one group photo of the Lampoon staff , Mr. Verrone occupies the front in a satin jester 's suit . The more soberly attired group behind includes Michael Reiss and Alfred Jean , who both became producers of " The Simpsons " and " The Critic " and eventually hired Mr. Verrone to write for both shows . <p> ( When not writing , Mr. Verrone makes miniature historical figures , which he sometimes sells on eBay ; his latest subject is Barack Obama . ) <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1990 's on a series of animated shows at Fox , where he was employed without guild representation . Alarmed by the resulting gaps in his health and pension coverage , he helped lead a successful push to organize the Fox writers just as " Futurama , " of which he eventually became a longtime producer , was being developed . A series of guild offices followed before he won a two-year term as president in 2005 . <p> Once he was a guild insider , Mr. Verrone said , he fully realized the union 's eroded position in the industry . In the mid-1980s , by his count , about 95 percent of Hollywood 's writing jobs in both television and major feature films were covered by the guild . That share , he maintains , has dropped to about 55 percent as the entertainment companies use nonguild divisions to produce a plethora of animated , reality and other shows . <p> Since 2000 , Mr. Verrone said , guild-covered writer earnings have risen at less than half the rate of entertainment industry profits . " I think if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Verrone said of what he saw as an increasingly chilly corporate stance toward writers , actors and directors . <p> A fellow union , the powerful International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees , last year handed Mr. Verrone a setback when its members took over work that had been performed by writers who were striking for guild representation on " America 's Next Top Model , " on the CW network . The episode left Mr. Verrone convinced that nonunion writers could best be organized by asking for provisions that would let the guild " reach up to the mother ship "  --  the parent corporations  --  to get authority over work for the nonguild units . <p> But Mr. Verrone has also achieved some unexpected successes . He and his allies reached an accord between their 7,500-member union and the Writers Guild of America East , despite a history of strained relations . The increased solidarity and a new militancy among leaders like Messrs . Verrone and Rosenberg and the East Coast writers guild president Chris Albers may portend rougher tactics in the coming face-off with companies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West Coast guild , pointed out that Hollywood 's experiments with that more contentious approach , as when East Coast members two years ago picketed a Viacom shareholders ' meeting wearing masks in the likeness of one of its top executives , have yielded little . <p> " The theory behind such tactics is basically to act terroristically against the corporations that employ you , " said Mr. Mazin , who noted that CBS News writers at the center of that action have continued to work without a contract . <p> Whatever else might happen , Mr. Verrone said things would not become personal in the coming talks . But he remained poised for a fight . " When it comes to collective bargaining , " he said , " it seems to me we 're dealing with some of the biggest corporations in the world . " ##
