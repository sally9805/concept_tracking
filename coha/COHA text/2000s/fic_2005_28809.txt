The March By E. L. Doctorow Random House E. L. Doctorow I At five in the morning someone banging on the door and shouting , her husband , John , leaping out of bed , grabbing his rifle , and Roscoe at the same time roused from the backhouse , his bare feet pounding : Mattie hurriedly pulled on her robe , her mind prepared for the alarm of war , but the heart stricken that it would finally have come , and down the stairs she flew to see through the open door in the lamplight , at the steps of the portico , the two horses , steam rising from their flanks , their heads lifting , their eyes wild , the driver a young darkie with rounded shoulders , showing stolid patience even in this , and the woman standing in her carriage no one but her aunt Letitia Pettibone of McDonough , her elderly face drawn in anguish , her hair a straggled mess , this woman of such fine grooming , this dowager who practically ruled the season in Atlanta standing up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would prove to be . The carriage was piled with luggage and tied bundles , and as she stood some silver fell to the ground , knives and forks and a silver candelabra , catching in the clatter the few gleams of light from the torch that Roscoe held . Mattie , still tying her robe , ran down the steps thinking stupidly , as she later reflected , only of the embarrassment to this woman , whom to tell the truth she had respected more than loved , and picking up and pressing back upon her the heavy silver , as if this was not something Roscoe should be doing , nor her husband , John Jameson , neither . Letitia would not come down from her carriage , there was no time , she said . She was a badly frightened woman with no concern for her horses , as John saw and quickly ordered buckets to be brought around , as the woman cried , Get out , get out , take what you can and leave , and seemed to be roused to anger as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearing now around the side of the house with the first light , as if drawn into existence by it . And I know him ! she cried . He has dined in my home . He has lived among us . He burns where he has ridden to lunch , he fires the city in whose clubs he once gave toasts , oh yes , someone of the educated class , or so we thought , though I never was impressed ! No , I was never impressed , he was too spidery , too weak in his conversation , and badly composed in his dress , careless of his appearance , but for all that I thought quite civilized in having so little gift to dissemble or pretend what he did not feel . And what a bitter gall is in my throat for what I believed was a domesticated man with a clear love for wife and children , who is no more than a savage with not a drop of mercy in his cold heart . It was difficult to get the information from her , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began giving orders and ran back in the house . It was she , Mattie , who listened . Her aunt 's hysteria , formulated oddly in terms of the drawing room , moved her to her own urgent attention . She had for the moment even forgotten her boys upstairs . They are coming , Mattie , they are marching . It is an army of wild dogs led by this apostate , this hideous wretch , this devil who will drink your tea and bow before he takes everything from you . And now , her message delivered , her aunt slumped back in her seat , and gave her order to be off . Where Letitia Pettibone was going Mattie could not get the answer . Nor how much time there was , in fact , before the scourge arrived at her own door . Not that she doubted the woman . She looked into the sky slowly lightening to its gray beginnings of the day . She heard nothing but the cock crowing and , as she turned , suddenly angry , the whisperings of the slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then with the team away , the carriage rolling down the gravel path , Mattie turned , lifting the hem of her robe , and mounted the steps only to see that horrible child Pearl , insolent as ever , standing , arms folded , against the pillar as if the plantation was her own . john jameson was not unprepared . As far back as September , when the news had come that Hood had pulled out and the Union armies had Atlanta , he sat Mattie down and told her what had to be done . The rugs were rolled , the art was taken down from the walls , her needlepoint chairs -- whatever she valued , he told her -- her English fabrics , the china , even her family Bible : it was all to be packed up and carted to Milledgeville and thence put on the train to Savannah , where John 's cotton broker had agreed to store their things in his warehouse . Not my piano , she 'd said , that will stay . It would rot in the dampness of that place . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music in any case . Mattie was dismayed to see her home so depleted . Through the bare windows the sun shone , lighting up the floors as if her life were going backward and she was again a young bride in a new-built unfurnished manse and with a somewhat frightening husband twice her age . She wondered how John knew the war would touch them directly . In fact he did n't , but he was a man whose success gave him reason to suppose he was smarter than most people . He had a presence , with his voluminous chest and large head of wild white hair . Do n't argue with me , Mattie . They lost twenty or thirty thousand men taking that city . There 's hell to pay . You 're a general , with a President who 's a madman . Would you just sit there ? So where ? To Augusta ? To Macon ? And how will he ride , if not through these hills ? And do n't expect that poor excuse for a Rebel army to do anything about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God I am , what will I have lost , tell me ? Mattie was not allowed to disagree in such matters . She felt even more dismayed and said not a thing when , with the crops in , John arranged to sell away his dozen prime field hands . They were bound , all of them , to a dealer in Columbia , South Carolina . When the day came and they were put in shackles into the wagon , she had to run upstairs and cover her ears so as not to hear the families wailing down in the shacks . All John had said was No buck nigger of mine will wear a Federal uniform , I 'll promise you that . But for all his warning and preparation she could not believe the moment had come to leave Fieldstone . The fear made her legs weak . She could not imagine how to live except in her own home , with her own things , and the Georgian world arranged to provide her and her family what their station demanded . And though Aunt Letitia was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For all his foresight , John was running around this way and that , red-faced , shouting and giving orders . The boys , roused out of bed and still only half dressed , came down the stairs with their rifles and ran out through the back . Mattie went to her bedroom and stood not knowing where to start . She heard herself whimpering . Somehow she dressed and grabbed whatever she could from her armoire and bath and threw everything into two portmanteaus . She heard a gunshot and , looking out the back window , saw one of the mules go down on its knees . Roscoe was leading another from the stable , while her older boy , John Junior , primed his rifle . It seemed only minutes later , with the sun barely on the treetops , that the carriages were waiting out front . Where were they to seat themselves ? Both carriages were loaded with luggage and food hampers and sacks of sugar and flour . And now the morning breeze brought the smoke around from the stacks where John had set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sooty life drifting away in the sky . when the jamesons were gone , Pearl stood in the gravel path still holding her satchel . The Massah had only glanced at her before laying his whip on the horses . Roscoe , driving the second carriage , had come past her and , without looking , dropped at her feet something knotted in a handkerchief . She made no move to retrieve it . She waited in the peace and silence of their having gone . She felt the cool breeze on her legs . Then the air grew still and warm and , after a moment in which the earth seemed to draw its breath , the morning sun spread in a rush over the plantation . Only then did she pick up what Roscoe had dropped . She knew immediately what it was through the cloth : the same two gold coins he had showed her once when she was little . His life savings . Dey real , Miss Porhl , he had said . You putem ' tween yer teeth you taste how real dey is . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dese an you c'n fly lak de eagles high , high ober de eart -- das what de eagles mean on dese monies . Pearl felt the hot tears in her throat . She went around the big house , past the outbuildings and the smoking fodder and the dead mules , and past the slave quarters where they were busy singing and putting their things together , and down along the trail through the woods to where the Massah had given leave to lay out a graveyard . There were by now six graves in this damp clearing , each marked by a wood shingle with the person 's name scratched in . The older grave mounds , like her mother 's , were covered with moss . Pearl squatted and read the name aloud : Nancy Wilkins . Mama , she said . I free . You tole me , Mah chile , my darlin Porhl , you will be free . So dey gone and I is . I free , I free like no one else in de whole worl but me . Das how free . Did Massah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Uh-uh . Lak I hant his marigol eyes an high cheeks an more his likeness dan de runts what his wife ma 'm made with the brudders one and two . I , with skin white as a cahnation flow'r . Pearl fell forward to her knees and clasped her hands . Dear God Jesus , she whispered , make a place fer dis good woman beside you . An me , yore Porhl , teach me to be free . slowly , the slaves , with their belongings wrapped in bundles or carried in old carpetbags , walked up to the main house and distributed themselves out front under the cypresses . They looked into the sky as if whatever it was they were told was coming would be from that direction . They wore their Sunday clothes . There were seven adults -- two men , the elder Jake Early and Jubal Samuels , who had but one eye , and five women , including the old granny who could not walk very well -- and three small children . The children were unusually quiet . They stayed close by and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earth . Jake Early did not have to counsel patience . The fear they had all seen in the eyes of the fleeing Massah and Mistress told them that deliverance had come . But the sky was cloudless , and as the sun rose everyone settled down and some even nodded off , which Jake Early regretted , feeling that when the Union soldiers came they should find black folk not at their ease but smartly arrayed as a welcoming company of free men and women . He himself stood in the middle of the road with his staff and did not move . He listened . For the longest while there was nothing but the mild stirring of the air , like a whispering in his ear or the rustle of woodland . But then he did hear something . Or did he ? It was n't exactly a sound , it was more like a sense of something transformed in his own expectation . And then , almost as if what he held was a divining rod , the staff in his hand pointed to the sky westerly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came away from the trees : what they saw in the distance was smoke spouting from different points in the landscape , first here , then there . But in the middle of all this was a change in the sky color itself that gradually clarified as an upward-streaming brown cloud risen from the earth , as if the world was turned upside down . And , as they watched , the brown cloud took on a reddish cast . It moved forward , thin as a hatchet blade in front and then widening like the furrow from the plow . It was moving across the sky to the south of them . When the sound of this cloud reached them , it was like nothing they had ever heard in their lives . It was not fearsomely heaven-made , like thunder or lightning or howling wind , but something felt through their feet , a resonance , as if the earth was humming . Then , carried on a gust of wind , the sound became for moments a rhythmic tromp that relieved them as the human reason for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ edges of this sound of a trompled-upon earth , they heard the voices of living men shouting , finally . And the lowing of cattle . And the creaking of wheels . But they saw nothing . Involuntarily , they walked down toward the road but still saw nothing . The symphonious clamor was everywhere , filling the sky like the cloud of red dust that arrowed past them to the south and left the sky dim , it was the great processional of the Union armies , but of no more substance than an army of ghosts . clarke had in his foraging party a two-wagon train , a string of three extra mules , and twenty men mounted . General orders specified no fewer than fifty men . He was several miles off the column , and so , coming upon the plantation , he resolved to make quick work of it . As they rode onto the grounds he immediately saw , and ignored , the slaves standing there . He shook his head . They had their old cracked drummers ' cases and cotton sacks tied up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posted his pickets and set the men to work . In the yard behind the outbuildings , the fodder stack was a smoking pile , flakes of black ash blowing off in the breeze . There were three mules with their heads blown all to hell . His orders were to respond to acts of defiance commensurately . Nor was he less determined when the men marched out of the dairy with sacks of sugar , cornmeal , flour , and rice on their shoulders . In the smokehouse , the shelves sagged with crocks of honey and sorghum . Hanging from hooks were the sides of bacon and cured hams the Massah did n't have time for the taking . And one of the bins was filled with a good two hundred pounds of sweet potatoes . From the Hardcover edition .
