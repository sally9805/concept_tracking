Headnote Drawing upon new research , South Beach Diet cardiologist ARTHUR AGATSTON suggests we can detect and prevent heart disease earlier than ever . Our reporter investigates // Heart disease is the biggest killer of women , period . Despite our fears of breast cancer , terrorism , violent crime , and flying , heart problems snuff out some 349,000 women each yearmore than the next five causes of death combined . Even worse , 64% of women who die suddenly of heart attack or stroke have no previous symptoms . It does n't have to be that way , says preventive cardiologist Arthur Agatston , MD , who developed the widely known South Beach Diet . He believes we have the tools in hand right now to stem this epidemic . " You do n't have to have a heart attack , " Agatston insists , and his new book , The South Beach Heart Program , is his comprehensive guide to helping make sure Americans do n't . Preventing heart disease is not a recent cause for Agatston . He developed the South Beach Diet specifically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had a computer tomography ( CT ) heart scan , you may have heard your result referred to as the Agatston score : He developed this measure of calcified plaque in arteries , which indicates heart risk-testimony to his contribution to the field . Agatston argues that by combining this screening test with other sophisticated new ones , Americans can identify their heart risk years or decades earlier-and with more precision-than ever before . And with targeted prevention involving special drugs and the proper combination of smart eating and exercise , we can wipe out heart disease just as we eradicated polio and rickets . " At our clinic , and at other top heart clinics across the country , our patients almost never have heart attacks , " Agatston says . " We only see one or two a year-and those are primarily in patients who do n't take their meds . " He makes a persuasive case , but not all cardiologists are on board : The value of these heart-screening tools in saving lives is among the most controversial issues in cardiology today . I decide the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach is to offer myself as a guinea pig . I also bring along a friend , Stacey Berkley Devine , a Miami-based harpist and yoga instructor who knows firsthand the toll of heart disease . Her father died of a heart attack at 49 ; Stacey recently turned 50 . DAY ONE A Mammogram for the Heart On a bright October morning , we arrive at the waiting room of Agatston 's plush new clinic in the heart of South Beach feeling cranky and on edge . Since midnight the day before , we have had to forego food and coffee for our first screen-a blood test to gauge our fasting levels of glucose , various types of cholesterol , and other markers . Fortunately for everyone , we are soon ushered in to meet Agatston . He 's a thin , youthful-looking man of 59 with only a sprinkling of gray in his hair . His skin has the rosy glow of someone who exercises regularly . He greets Stacey and me with a smile : " My aim is to make sure you 're as healthy as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood panel and physical miss too many people with significant cardiovascular disease , explains Agatston . " I 'm trying to get a more complete picture of your risk . If you have hidden heart disease , I want to know now , because we can stop further damage to your cardiovascular system . " We fill out questionnaires about our health , fitness , and family history of disease and then offer up our forearms for the blood sample . Then Agatston lays out a plan for how we will proceed-and it quickly becomes clear how his approach differs from almost all other cardiologists . At minimum , he says , he wants us to get a treadmill stress test and ultrasound of the carotid arteries in the neck , which provide the main supply of blood to the brain . Most doctors would n't screen at-risk patients for this , let alone apparently healthy women like Stacey and me . Then , depending on the results of our blood work , he might recommend a 64-slice CT scan of the heart . " What would that tell me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a large flat-panel screen mounted on the wall next to his desk . With his pointer , he targets blockages in the major artery of the patient 's heart that even our untrained eyes can readily spot . Better yet , the scan distinguishes between hard plaque-the calcified patches where cholesterol lining the arteries had ruptured and healed over-and more dangerous soft plaque , the source of new , potentially lethal ruptures . " It can catch problems way ahead of any symptoms , " he says . " I call this test a mammogram for the heart . " Agatston runs his pointer over the inside wall of an artery . " See this bump that looks like a pimple ? It 's called soft plaque . It used to be impossible to see , but now we have this new technology that uses a dye to highlight it . When soft plaque ruptures , if the blood clot that forms around the lesion is large enough , it can impede blood flow , starving the heart of oxygen . That 's what triggers a heart attack . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not yet menopausal , and therefore my risk is n't high enough to warrant the scan . Of course , now I want one . " I generally do n't recommend a CT scan for women unless they have risk factors and they 're postmenopausal , " the doctor explains . " That 's when women lose the protective effect of hormones like estrogen , and risk of heart disease climbs steeply . " DAY TWO Stress on the Treadmill We return wearing gym clothes for the treadmill stress test . " How difficult do you think it 's going to be ? " Stacey whispers to me in the waiting room beforehand . " You 're a yoga instructor , " I reassure her . " It 'll be a walk in the park . " Stacey gallantly goes first-and returns dripping in sweat . " That was not a walk in the park , " she says , still panting . Moments later , it 's my turn . A technician lifts my shirt and begins pressing electrode leads-flat disks backed with adhesive-all over my chest ( I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test ) . Then the treadmill is switched on and my heartbeat appears as a peak-shaped tracing-or electrocardiogram ( EKG ) - on an adjacent computer screen . As I begin striding-and while I still have the breath-I ask Agatston what this test will tell him about my cardiovascular risk . " The heart requires anywhere from two to five times more blood flow when you 're exercising than when you 're at rest , " he says . " So when you 're exerting yourself , we 're more likely to detect compromised blood flow , which shows up as changes in the EKG reading . " Every few minutes , the speed of the treadmill is increased and the ramp elevated . Soon , I 'm too breathless to talk . Because I do 40-minute stints on an elliptical trainer a few times a week , I have little trouble completing the 20-minute test . But like Stacey , I 'm glad when it 's over . DAY THREE A Peek inside Our Arteries Using an ultrasound scanner , Agatston plans to check our carotid arteries , located on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which are buried deep beneath the chest wall , the carotids are close to the surface , making them easy to visualize with ultrasound . This time I go first . At the start of the test , a technician squirts gel on my neck . He then moves a device called a transducer up and down along my carotid artery-first on the left side of my neck , then on the right . I 'm riveted by the ultrasound images displayed next to me on a screen . Thanks to computer enhancement , I can see blood coursing through the artery and blood moving away from the brain through an adjacent vein . Then the technician turns on a switch and I can hear a sound indicating blood swooshing through the artery . " That 's a nice low pitch , " he says . " If there 's any blockage , the sound is more high pitched . " The Tale of the Tape At last it 's time to sit down with Agatston to go over our exam results . He begins by reviewing our medical histories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he tells us , is having already had a heart attack . Fortunately , neither of us fits that profile . Equally fortunate , neither of us has ever experienced the telltale symptoms of advanced coronary disease : a general weakness ; faintness or breathlessness during physical exertion ; or pain or a squeezing sensation in the chest , upper abdomen , or back that lasts for more than a few minutes at a time . Next on his list of concerns is a family history of the disease . He focuses on the death of Stacey 's father from heart disease at age 49 . " Early onset heart disease in your family is one of the single biggest risk factors , " he says . " That 's especially true if heart disease killed your father or a brother before age 55 , or your mother or a sister before age 65 . It 's a big red flag . " " But my father was sedentary , overweight , and a heavy smoker , " protests Stacey . " I 'm much healthier . " Without a doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to overcome.He checks our blood pressure numbers . Stacey 's are an enviable 97/59 . My reading is a tad higher , 112/66 , but still way below what is defined as high blood pressure-a systolic ( upper ) number of 140 or greater and a diastolic ( lower ) number of 90 or more . " No problem there , " Agatston says . Both of our EKGs look perfectly normal . Agatston points to a dip-or valley-in the tracings of our heartbeats . " Sometimes we see a deeper drop , or trough , there . It 's called the ST depression and can signal a blockage . " Stacey and I also passed the ultrasound of our carotid arteries with flying colors . Neither of us has any visible plaque , and the inner lining of our arteries is smooth and shows no signs of thickening-indications that we have healthy vessels and are at low risk of heart attack or stroke . Stacey beams with happiness . " I guess all that yoga has paid off , " she says . Finally , he looks at the results @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blood panel we 'd get with any doctor : screens for LDL ( " bad " cholesterol ) , HDL ( " good " cholesterol ) , triglycerides , and blood glucose levels , a test for diabetes ( the disease drives up heart risk ) . But that 's where the similarities end . Agatston had also requested advanced blood testing for three other factors : homocysteine , an amino acid that at high levels raises your heart disease risk as much as smoking and interacts with other risk factors to hike your odds skyward ; lipoprotein(a) , or Lp(a) , a particularly dangerous type of LDL that Agatston refers to as the " widow maker " because of its propensity for clogging arteries ; and C-reactive protein ( CRP ) , a marker of inflammation-in large amounts it 's thought to promote the rupture of plaque . A large 2002 study in the New England Journal of Medicine found CRP to be a stronger predictor of heart problems in women than the standard marker , LDL cholesterol . Agatston is happy to see that all our numbers look good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 74 mg/dl . " That 's particularly protective , " he says . A recent study shows that raising HDL by just 5 mg/dl cuts cardiovascular risk by 10% . " You get a lot of bang for your buck as your HDL level climbs , " says Agatston . " What about lipoprotein(a) ? " I ask . " How did we do on that measure ? " In his book , he describes this particle as a major villain that could sometimes " explain plaque build-up seen in heart scans of patients who have seemingly normal cholesterol levels . " Humoring me , he double-checks the numbers and reassures us our levels are low . Stacey and I are beginning to look like twins-very healthy twins . Despite similar results , however , Agatston ranks my risk at less than 10% ( meaning 90% of people my age are more likely to get heart disease ) and Stacey 's at 20%-low , but double mine . " It 's because she has a family history of the disease and you do n't , " he says . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further testing after she hits menopause . As for me , he says , " Unless you develop high blood pressure or other risk factors , I wo n't need to see you again . " Good news all around , but what if we had n't aced all those tests , I want to know . Then what ? The first challenge for patients is to improve their diet and begin exercising , says Agatston . ( See " Your Best Heart Attack Prevention Plan , " p. 159 , for more information . ) But , he warns , " you can only get so far with diet and exercise-genes count , too . " That 's why he argues that anyone with risk factors should have all the tests he performed on Stacey and me done by age 50-or even earlier if there 's familial heart disease at a young age . " If the results from those exams raise any further concerns , I may also order a heart scan , " he says . " Then I sit down with the patient and recommend a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For patients with high LDL or CRP scores , statins drugs can work well , he reports . " They 're usually very well tolerated and can virtually stop atherosclerosis in its tracks , " he tells us . " I just saw a 65-year-old woman whose cholesterol levels and other risk factors have been tightly controlled over the past 10 years . A recent heart scan shows no new plaque above the level recorded at the time of her first scan 7 years ago . " Other powerful interventions include prescription-strength niacin pills , for raising low HDL levels ; aspirin , for countering inflammation and thinning the blood ; a prescription fish-oil supplement , for improving the overall health of the vessels and stabilizing irregular heartbeats ; and a variety of medications for controlling high blood pressure and diabetes . The Skeptics ' View By the end of our consultation with Agatston , Stacey and I ca n't help being swayed by his perspective . But not all cardiologists agree that the research is far enough along to justify the extra expense of all the testing he proposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reactive rather than proactive toward heart disease when it comes to identifying and treating people at moderate risk , " says cardiologist Clyde W. Yancy , MD , medical director of Baylor Heart and Vascular Institute in Dallas and a spokesperson for the American Heart Association . He respects what Agatston is doing but thinks it 's too soon to be making blanket recommendations about screening tests . In his opinion , that kind of judgment call has to be made case by case , based on individual risk factors . Yancy also cautions that preventive health care is still in its infancy . " We need to fund much more research aimed at clarifying our understanding and treatment of the new risk factors-things like homocysteine and C-reactive protein , " he says . At the Women 's Heart Clinic at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , MN , director Sharonne Hayes , MD , agrees with Yancy . " Testing for Lp(a) , homocysteine , and CRP has not yet been shown to improve a patient 's chances of living longer , " she says . " They can help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I use the same tests in my practice every day . But until we have definitive proof , I think we have to be much more selective about who gets these tests . If we screened everybody , we 'd break the bank . " Hayes is n't kidding : The total bill for all six tests Agatston recommends runs about $2,000 . Right now , insurance would cover only a small portion of that bill , though Agatston expects that to change as more research findings prove the tests ' value . Nonetheless , Jay N. Cohn , MD , director of the Rasmussen Center for Cardiovascular Disease Prevention at the University of Minnesota , is more aligned with Agatston 's stance . Although he acknowledges the controversy about the best screening methods , he believes " there 's agreement that we need to be doing a much better job at identifying people in need of early intervention . " Echoing Agatston 's words , he adds , " With good preventive care , heart attacks can be virtually eliminated . " Agatston has heard his peers " concerns-and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already established risks of heart disease . That 's why Stacey and I did n't get the CT scan , no matter how much we may have wanted it . He also agrees that research should continue on things like homocysteine and Lp(a) , so that doctors can further refine diagnosis and treatment . But he feels strongly that it 's time we start spending our health care dollars more wisely . " As a society , we 're investing the bulk of our money in bypass surgery , angioplasty , and other expensive , aggressive late-stage treatments for heart disease , " he says . Would n't it be better to spend that money on making sure people never have a heart attack in the first place ? " The tests are n't cheap , " he concedes , " but if you think of them as an investment in our future , they 're a bargain .
