A SWAMPY HEAT ENVELOPED Tom as he emerged from the refrigerated multiplex into the midnight of a summer 's eve under the starless sky of electric Manhattan . Tired , he negotiated his way around the slow-walkers and loud-talkers along West 23rd Street , blubbering and blowing their noses and debating the genius of the movie 's auteur . Meanwhile , a new batch of victims was standing on line for the late show , eager to subject themselves to three hours of carnage engineered by the best fakers in the business . <p> It was another Hollywood go at World War II , with flurries of enemy machine-gun bullets killing random American soldiers with gory efficacy - the ones who asked their pals if they wanted to live forever , the ones who pined for their mothers , the ones who clowned in the face of the Axis , even the hero who planted the flag of democracy on the beach as he bled to death . All of them , all dead - on celluloid . Which was like Bill Gates losing a billion dollars after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " on paper . " This was only a movie , after all , and no movie could ever convey the realities of a war to those who had had the good fortune to be elsewhere . <p> Tom thought of Eric and felt a blast of air-conditioning from somewhere , but it was gone as soon as it had arrived . Perhaps he was coming down with something . He doubted it ; he never got sick . He had passed no open doorways and in fact was walking atop a subway grate , under which a train was passing and blasting him with the heat of Hades . <p> It must have been so easy in the old days , when all you had to do was go down Below and retrieve your lover , provided you were heroic enough , like Gilgamesh . And if you were n't , you could always hire Hercules to make the journey for you . Deals could be brokered . Pluto was not unreasonable . All was not necessarily lost . <p> Tom rounded the corner at Eighth Avenue and felt a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All the young men were out , as usual , hanging around in packs outside of The Break and the Big Cup coffee joint and streaming around the corner from Barracuda . Big muscles and tank tops and tight shorts and bulges and tanned flesh and fresh faces and laughter and eyes sizing you up as you passed . Except that for Tom , the eyes no longer turned his way . The twentysomethings and thirtysomethings must have seen him in their peripheral vision and known he was too old to warrant a glance , a wounded wolf ignored by the rest of the pack . Tom had become invisible to them , ostracized even here in Chelsea , where he had lived for twenty years . Go away , leave us alone , look among your own kind . Or maybe all they were saying was , you can look , but do n't touch . <p> Tom smiled to himself . Truth be told , he cared little whether they looked at him or not . What these boys did n't know was that he no longer had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ careless ; the risks were too great . he had had his wasted youth already , and after that all those years with Eric , and after Eric ... well , the safest sex was none at all , and if nothing else , Tom was determined to survive , as he had done thus far . Latex from the Malaysian jungle seemed fragile protection against so insidious an enemy . Was it worth realizing afterward that the helmet that was supposed to save your life had failed to stop the bullet ? <p> The grocery store was open all night and Tom needed things , so he went in and grabbed a basket . Skim milk , yogurt , eggs , peaches , zucchini squash , sparkling water , raisin bran , chicken breasts , toilet paper , and a pint of ice cream . Even here , at this late hour , the store had five or six guys in it who were shopping leisurely and cruising each other . They were all younger than Tom and never even noticed him . He walked home down West 20th Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under the shadowed trees , watching out for sidewalks upturned by old roots and waiting to trip him and his eggs . <p> Halfway down the block , he saw a vision : a drop-dead gorgeous young man ( what we would have called a youngman in the bad old days , Tom thought ) , in bell-bottom jeans and black leather motorcycle jacket and black leather boots , who was unmistakably cruising him , leaning against a wrought-iron fence , knee jutting out in Tom 's path , unlit cigarette dangling , lips wet and sultry . He was as thin as a wraith but not unhealthily so . His hair , long and full and raven-feathered , glistened with a blue sheen in the light of the streetlamp , and his earthy skin and wide-set cheekbones reminded Tom of a Native American he had met one night in the meat-packing district and linked up with a few other times - but that was ages ago , before Tom had even moved to Chelsea , when he was still a youngman himself , when this boy would still have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Tom avoided his natural inclination these days to pretend he did n't see him , and went ahead and looked . <p> " Got a light ? " the youngman asked . <p> Tom gave a startled smile - though he should have expected to be asked for either this or the time - and fished out his Zippo . Lighting the cigarette , Tom noted the vibrant flame 's reflection in the boy 's black eyes . Remarkable how much he resembled that other youngman from so long ago . The tobacco crackled to life and the smoke wafted up , clouding the distance between them and lending the dark face an ethereal quality . <p> " Thanks , man , " the youngman said . <p> Tom , feeling very much like an oldman , put his lighter away and made as if to go , but the youngman lifted his chin and raised his eyebrows in invitation . Tom could scarcely believe it . <p> " Come with me to the docks . " <p> " The docks ? " Tom said , thinking , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Were there still any left ? The docks in Chelsea had become a yuppie sports complex , and the mayor was having the Village docks dismantled , he thought . Besides , the police were more vigilant these days than in the seventies . That gig was up . <p> " Come on , man , " the youngman said , reaching out and placing his hand on Tom 's fly . " I want you , but not here . " <p> Tom looked around but saw none of his neighbors , either on the street or peeping out their windows . He would have batted the youngman 's hand away if his arms were n't full of groceries . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Tom said . " I 've got to get home . " <p> " Let me go with you , " the youngman implored , rubbing Tom . <p> " Stop that , " Tom said , though he wanted it to go on . But he was damned if he was going to invite this boy in . When you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rob you out of house and home , but at fifty , you were wise to this potentiality , especially when this boy was the youngest thing to give you the time of day since ... well , since before Tom could remember . <p> " How about it , Dad ? " <p> " I ca n't . I 've ... I 've got a partner , see , and - " <p> Stop it . He 's dead . Eric 's dead . <p> " Oh , really ? " The youngman cast a cool eye on Tom , drawing down on his cigarette . He dropped his hand from Tom and dug a small brown vial from inside his jacket . He unscrewed the lid , placed the vial up to his nose , and took a whiff . Amyl nitrate . Poppers . He offered it to Tom , holding it up near his nose . <p> " No , thanks . " Tom had n't smelled the stuff since 1984 . He caught a whiff of it now , by accident , and it took him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everard Baths ... Jesus . <p> " I want you , " the youngman said . <p> " My ice cream is going to melt . I have to go . " <p> Dejection in the youngman 's face . Tom broke away and continued toward home . Sweat was dripping down his back , more a result of the encounter than of the humidity . Why should the kid have looked so disappointed ? He could have any guy he wanted . All he had to do was go back the way Tom had come , to the Big Cup or even the grocery store . Tom was sure one of them would take him home or go with him to the docks , if there were any docks left to go to , if they had n't been Disneyfied like Times Square . <p> Tom looked over his shoulder to make sure he was n't being followed , but the youngman was nowhere to be seen . He could not have run away so fast , not without a sound , not in those boots . He had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Sighing heavily , Tom left his groceries on the sidewalk and went back to look for the youngman and tell him to beat it . He made a quick search of the shadows , around the stoops and the garbage cans and the recycling bins , but found no sign of him . The unfinished cigarette was slowly burning itself out on the sidewalk . The scent of amyl nitrate lingered in the air for a moment and was gone - the scent of the youngman , the scent of Tom 's youth , the scent of the promise of sex . He picked up the cigarette to finish it but found it so stale it was putrid . <p> " Oh , and a Bloody Mary for me , " Edwin said , handing the brunch menu back to their biceps-flexing waiter , who perhaps was really waiting to be discovered as an underwear model . Edwin , as if in afterthought , laid three thick fingers on the waiter 's hairy forearm and said , " Easy on the blood , hon , heavy on the Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was new and had never run into Edwin before . The waiter did n't notice Tom 's sympathy but only smirk-smiled to himself as he went to the bar . <p> That brief contact of Edwin 's fingers on the waiter 's flesh would stay with Edwin all day and enter his dreams . Edwin worked such moments into his life as often as possible . People thought of him as touchy-feely , but they failed to realize it was no accident . Edwin 's mind was always working , plotting his next free grope . That " heavy on the Mary " had likely been rehearsed , along with the hand movement . Edwin had always been thus . He took what he could get , from whomever struck his fancy . <p> " I would have gone with you . Why did n't you call me ? " <p> " Hmm ? " Tom 's thoughts were elsewhere . Sunday brunch with his friends had been such a routine for so many years , he sometimes slept through the gossip and the chitchat - even now , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed like only yesterday they had a regular crew of eight or nine on Sundays . One by one , they had been bumped off , like the characters in Agatha Christie 's And Then There Were None . <p> " The movie . Supposed to be a lot of cutie-pies in that picture . All running around in uniform and getting all muddy . " <p> " Edwin , they 're getting their heads blown off . " <p> " Oh , who cares ? " <p> " There was nothing sexy about that movie . Not unless you like bloody American entrails , or severed manly limbs , or a bullet hole in the middle of a corn-fed forehead . " <p> " That 's no excuse for not calling . What else did I have to do last night but watch some Ken Burns crap on Channel Thirteen ? " <p> " It was lousy . You would have hated it . " <p> " Heavy on the Mary , " the waiter said , lowering the drink . <p> Edwin 's eyes lit up at the sight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top . He gave it one good stir and gulped down a fourth of it . " Love it , " he croaked at the waiter , reaching out to stroke his arm again . " Better than Viagra . " <p> The waiter moved out of Edwin 's reach and said , " And a regular coffee , black , " placing a large sloshing mug before Tom . <p> " For Mr. Boring , " Edwin said , still piqued . <p> The waiter smirked again as he turned away , no doubt thinking how much he hated old queens and promising he would never become like them . No Judy Garland records , no MGM musicals , no Auntie Mame , no singing showtunes at Eighty-Eights , no Saturday afternoon Metropolitan Opera broadcasts . Not only that , but he would never lose his looks or die for any reason . <p> Tom sipped his coffee . It burned his lips . He would have to let it cool down . He watched the condensation drip down the side of Edwin 's glass . The bloody Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He should have ordered his coffee iced , but it was too late now - if he called the waiter back , it would only look like he was trying not to be boring . <p> " Seems like you do n't want anything to do with me anymore , " Edwin said , looking for all the world like Shelley Winters in A Place in the Sun , sitting across from Montgomery Clift in the rowboat and saying , " You wish I was dead , " when he had taken her out on the lake for the express purpose of drowning her . <p> " Edwin , " Tom said , " come on , that 's ridiculous . " <p> " You never call , we do n't do movies , we - " <p> " We 're having brunch , are n't we ? " <p> " You 're only doing it because you have to . " <p> " Who 's making me ? " <p> " Ask yourself that . " <p> The waiter came with their food and Edwin ordered another Bloody Mary . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise ; you never knew where Edwin 's fingers would stray next . Once ; when Tom went with him to a gay Malaysian restaurant in the Village , Edwin had reached under their waiter 's sarong and got his hand slapped . People had stared ; Tom had wanted to hide . <p> " More coffee , " Tom said . Make it black , ' cause I 'm boring . <p> " You want to know why ? " Edwin asked . <p> Tom poked the yolks of his eggs Benedict . See how they run . <p> " Survivor 's guilt , " Edwin said , mouth full of huevos rancheros . " That 's the only reason you still brunch with me . " <p> " That 's not true , " Tom said . <p> Though it probably was , in part . Of all the men in their circle , Tom had always liked Edwin the least , and all they held in common anymore was their shared grief for lost friends . Edwin had certainly never liked Eric . Tom ascribed it to jealousy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mutually respectful , loving relationship that Edwin had proved himself incapable of . For a long time now , Tom had thought he was still putting up with Edwin out of pity , but perhaps he was right and it was guilt . <p> " You 're embarrassed to be seen with me . I 'm fat and ugly and make you uncomfortable . " <p> " Stop it , Edwin . " Tom came up with a smile . " Listen , I 'm sorry I did n't call you last night , okay ? I just thought you would n't like the movie , that 's all . " <p> " That 's nice of you to say , Tom . By the way , I was thinking of going to the Film Forum this afternoon . They 're showing Mildred Pierce and Craig 's Wife . Care to join me ? " <p> " If I do , it 'll really be out of guilt , Tom thought . <p> " I ca n't . I have to prepare for a presentation for Monday . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he 'd just proven a point to himself . " When did you start working again ? " <p> " Just this week , " Tom said , but he could n't sustain the lie for long , so he changed the subject : " Edwin , do guys still meet at the docks , like in the old days ? " <p> " You 're asking me ? " <p> " There was this youngman , last night . " <p> " Youngman ? " Edwin laughed . " You 're going retro on me . " <p> " That 's what I felt like , last night ... like back in the seventies . This youngman was wearing bell-bottoms , and - " <p> " Oh , the kids are all into that look these days . The personalized T-shirts are out again , too . " <p> " You 're right , " Tom said . " Back then , I remember one saying I CHOKED LINDA LOVELACE . The other day I saw one that said CHRISTINA SUCKS . BRITNEY SWALLOWS . " <p> He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come out all wrong . Edwin would think he was bragging - or lying to spite him - and he would become jealous and pouty . He would be no help at all in sorting it out . <p> " What does this have to do with the docks ? " <p> " Nothing , " Tom said . <p> Except I went there once with this Native American , when I was half as old as I am now , and I saw him again last night , and he invited me to join him . He said he wanted me . <p> " They 're being dismantled , if you must know , " Edwin said . " New York is family friendly now , like Las Vegas , God help us . " <p> " Good-bye , Sodom , " Tom said , raising his coffee mug . <p> " I 'll drink to that . " <p> " Hello ... what ? " <p> " What , indeed ? " Edwin contemplated his glass , the inside of which was coated with a gloppy , tomatoey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tom swirled the last of his coffee and downed it . It was full of bitter grounds . " Not by a longshot . Maybe Sodom was n't so bad . Maybe you and I should have gone up in that pillar of fire with everyone else . " <p> Edwin unscrewed the lid off the salt shaker and , with a look of triumph , dumped its contents into Tom 's empty mug . <p> " No looking back , " Edwin said . " They would n't want that . " <p> Tom wet his fingertip , stuck it in the salt , and licked it off . It tasted like sex , the way sex used to be . <p> How do you know ? he wondered . How do you fucking know what they would want ? <p> TOM OPENED the freezer door and hastened the pint of ice cream out of its niche between the ice cube trays and the vodka , which he could identify by its metallic cap , though the bottle itself was obscured by the encroaching frost of more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrown it away , but in the end had let it be , as a reminder that he had slain this particular dragon without any twelve-step program or other hocus-pocus . The desire , or need , had simply abandoned him , sometime after he buried Eric . Still , he had concluded the bottle was not without its utility ; he could always chip it out of the ice if Edwin or some other guest ( what other guest ? ) came over . <p> He nursed the ice cream as he entered his study , scooping out spoonfuls and sucking them down without hardly considering . The curtains were sashed open but the drawn shifts glowed with sunlight . Eric , whose bed had been situated parallel to the windows after they moved him in here , had requested the shifts be kept down at all times . They made the light less harsh and he enjoyed watching them billow with the breeze in their random , ghostly way . Even after the last drug cocktail failed and the cytomegalovirus finally finished off his retinas , Eric wanted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be present , the shifts were there to keep him company with their shadow show . Eric said he could feel their subtle touch on his flesh , even at night , even in the absence of moonglow . <p> The room was musty now with book dust and cigarette smoke , the result of Tom 's efforts to replace the odors of the sickroom . He had moved in his computer , drafting table , and bookshelves after getting rid of the bed and everything else , but he had done precious little work here through the entire winter and spring - mostly pleasure reading and chain-smoking . Realizing now that the room had gone too far in its new direction , Tom placed the ice cream on his computer desk and went to open a window . It held fast from the humidity , but when Tom wrenched it loose , a gust of wind lifted the shift and plastered it against his face . <p> Freeing himself from it , he felt his breath catch , and a sudden pain in his chest , and a panic as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as he managed to grab the shift and fix it in the sash . He planted his palms on the gritty windowsill and stuck his head out the window for some air . He had to squint in the bright sun . As he looked at the people walking down below on West 20th , he saw a man leaning against the tree right in front , knee jutting out , arms folded across his chest . His face was obscured by the leaves and their shadows . Still , Tom could n't help but wonder if it was the youngman from last night , waiting for him , wanting him . <p> " Hey ! " Tom shouted . <p> Startled , the man moved away from the tree , and Tom caught a flash of his face in the dappled sunlight before the man turned his back on Tom and crossed the street to disappear behind a panel van . It was enough of a glimpse for Tom to realize it was not the raven-haired youth of last night . In fact , the man looked something like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric Tom had met at Fire Island , the vital Eric , the essential Eric . And that , of course , was impossible , because it was here in this room that Tom had held Eric 's hand as he slipped away . <p> " Wait ! " Tom called , and rushed out of his apartment and ran down the stairs . Please wait .... <p> When he got outside , he crossed the street to the panel van and saw the man walking leisurely at the end of the block , turning the corner at Eighth Avenue , heading north . Tom ran to the corner and followed through the thick Sunday Chelsea crowd , keeping an eye on the back of that head that looked so much like the back of Eric 's - when he had more hair . Tom brushed against people awkwardly as he passed , chanting apologies . It was impossible to run , but he was still gaining ground . <p> At West 23rd , the man crossed the street carelessly against the light . Tom started across , but a Mercedes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He waited at the curb , catching his breath while the cars and yellow taxis passed . Across the street , the man 's head bobbed down the subway steps and vanished from view . At the green light , Tom followed across the street and descended into the lower depths , past the token booth and its sleepy guardian and through the turnstiles , with the aid of his trusty MetroCard , just as a C train was screaming to a halt on the platform . The doors opened and loosed a cargo of sweaty passengers . Tom saw him getting on the train four cars up the platform . Having only a few seconds , Tom pushed his way past the off-loaders and hustled inside before the doors shut . <p> The C train pulled out of the 23rd Street station , heading uptown . The conductor said something unintelligible to that effect over the crackling loudspeaker , adding , " Nekft fftockhh kirtighorftreech pig fftachion ckhhh . " Tom squeezed past the straphangers and made for the connecting door . The C train rocked back and forth under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open and stepped into the darkness between the cars . The gap was narrow , but it seemed like a chasm . The car jump was a move well practiced by New Yorkers - a five-step thing you did in your sleep , like making your approach bowling-step out , grasp the opposite handle , cross the gap , slide the door open , step in . If you thought too much about it , you were liable to screw up . The train lurched oddly as Tom was crossing , but he was safely in the next car before he had time to panic , as they were pulling into 34th Street/Penn Station . It was nearly impossible to note all of the faces of those who disembarked . All he could hope to do was get to the third car ahead and trust that He Who Looked Like Eric was still there . <p> Tom thought of the many times he and Eric had been subway companions , usually not speaking much during the ride . In fact , they were never great conversationalists out of doors , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When you knew each other that well , small talk was intolerable . One could always tell when the other was making unnecessary conversation . As they grew older together , Tom and Eric fell into a routine of quiet dinners out , quiet movies , quiet walks , quiet vacations . Ever since moving in together , all significant chat had taken place within the walls of their apartment . Behind closed doors , they talked each others ' ears off . Eric was always talkier than Tom , but as his AIDS progressed , it became impossible to shut him up . Although he was a good listener , Tom discovered there were limits to what he could stand to hear . Sometimes Tom felt like clamping his hand over Eric 's mouth and holding it there . These were the worst times , when Eric was too sick to get out , when a fine meal or a walk or a subway ride might have contented him . The C train made three more stops before Tom was able to squeeze past all of the tightly packed passengers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the fourth car , they were pulling into the 59th Street station , and Tom caught a glimpse of the young Eric as he rose from his seat and exited the car . Tom pressed his way to the nearest door , excusing himself to everyone , and made it out as the doors were closing , their rubber moldings snatching at his heel . The man was heading out the turnstiles , but twenty people had queued up between them . Tom hoped he could catch up with him outside . <p> Up top at Columbus Circle , Tom saw him entering Central Park , past the marble statue of a reclining Neptune . Although Tom quickened his pace and the man seemed not to be walking any faster , the distance between them was somehow maintained . <p> " Hey ! " Tom called , getting winded . " Slow down , stop ! " <p> He followed him past the rows of park benches that Tom remembered as cruising grounds when he had moved to the city thirty years ago - but no more . These days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He followed him past the restored band shell , down the steps of the Bethesda Fountain , up the neighboring footpath , across the bridge , up a hill , and past a trickling brook , to where the paths went off in all directions through the densest woods of the park , the Ramble . <p> " Slow down , " Tom called . " I 've got to rest . " <p> The young Eric looked over his shoulder and smiled that smile that was so recognizable to Tom , from moments of intimacy , outings on a friend 's sailboat , Christmas mornings , New Year 's Eves , visits with nieces and nephews .... <p> " Eric ? " Tom said . <p> Eric hooked his finger at Tom and mouthed the words come on before taking a fork in the path and vanishing into the woods . <p> " Eric , wait ! " <p> Ignoring the furious beating of his heart , Tom followed the path uphill to where he had last seen Eric , but there was no sign of him here . Tom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smell of the forest , and tried to calm himself . There had to be a reasonable explanation for that smile . If he ever caught up to him , Tom would find he looked nothing like Eric at all , and he would offer an awkward apology . As long as Tom could find him . <p> Tom heard noises and went in their direction , up a rise and into deeper seclusion . To his right , he found two youngmen , the first on his knees before the other . Neither of them was Eric . Not that Tom would have put it past him , in the early days of their relationship . There had been that time at Jones Beach in the early eighties when Eric had promised to be right back , and Tom had gone to look for him some minutes later and discovered him in the bush with whomever had happened along .... <p> Tom quietly escaped farther along the path . <p> " Hey , mister , " came a honey-sweet voice to his left . <p> Tom turned and saw an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-shirt with white piping on the collar and sleeves , and block lettering that said I CHOKED LINDA LOVELACE . He was leaning against an acacia with his head cocked to one side , rubbing the faded crotch of his jeans and licking his lips . <p> " Where did you get that shirt ? " Tom asked , stupidly . He remembered the boy - or was projecting a memory onto him . They had met late one night in 1977 ( long before Eric , so why should he care ? ) on a bench in Stuyvesant Square and had gone off together into the bushes . He never knew the kid 's name , but he never forgot the T-shirt or the look , which was classic chicken . <p> " Got the time ? " The kid acted nonplused , indifferent . <p> " You ca n't be the boy that I - " <p> " Like what you see ? " <p> I ... no , I do n't think so . I do n't think so at all ... <p> " Come .

This was the genuine article . It really was him , unchanged since that night , down to the last freckle . Tom came within inches of his face . The boy 's breath was hot on Tom 's cheek . The rosy lips parted . <p> " Kiss me , " he said , in a voice that echoed all around . " Or do n't you like being kissed ? " <p> Tom leaned over , closing his eyes first , as he invariably did before a kiss . He met nothing but air . His forehead bumped against acacia bark . As he reached for the youth , he opened his eyes and found himself groping the tree . He spun his head around , but the boy had disappeared . <p> Giggling . He heard giggling in the forest and followed it up the path , and as he drew nearer , the sound metamorphosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a group of trees , Tom found two men , naked , standing at opposite ends of a third , filling him up while they kissed each other . Tom recognized them , though they had been tricks only , from one steamy night an eon ago at the Everard Baths , which had burned down long before Tom first encountered Eric on Fire Island . Tom 's salad days . Almost impossible to imagine now that any of it had ever happened . That one night at the Everard , Tom must have had five or more men at various times . And there had been so many such nights , at the Everard and the St. Mark 's and elsewhere . Many wee hours in Stuyvesant Square , bar pickups , rough trade in the meat-packing district . Hustlers in Bryant Park . Shady encounters in Times Square movie theater balconies . Midnight love on the rotting timbers of the docks . Lazy afternoons in the Ramble . <p> Tom had no idea how he had managed , out of all that , to survive , when HIV was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a name , long before even those first cases died . It was akin to charging Omaha Beach on D-Day and heading straight for the German batteries without receiving so much as a scratch . Looking back over his shoulder , all he could see for miles of beach were his dead buddies . <p> Tom could hear scores of men coupling in the Ramble , near and far , high and low . He wanted to shout at them : Do n't you understand where all this leads ? Have n't you learned anything ? . <p> The forest , growing darker by degrees , was suddenly calm and quiet . Tom looked at his watch . He had n't realized it was so late . He turned back and looked through the trees for the threesome , but they were gone . <p> If any of them had even been here at all . <p> " Tom , " came Eric 's voice from behind him . <p> Tom pivoted , but no one was there . When he turned back , he could no longer recall from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tom called . <p> Eric , came the returning echo .

He picked the steepest downhill path , which soon leveled out and split into three more paths , all darkening . Tom 's sense of direction had left him utterly , and this part of the Ramble seemed unrecognizable , dense and overgrown . <p> " Hey , Dad .

He fully expected to see his hand pass right through to the other side of the leather jacket . But as soon as he was close enough to smell the smoke and the poppers , the youngman seemed to startle , and he vanished . <p> His image was replaced by that of an athletic guy in a flimsy tank top and Adidas running shorts running right toward Tom , who had no time to step out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late , and they crashed . Tom fell to the ground , dazed for a moment before the pair of tanned , lean arms reached down to grab him and help him to his feet . <p> " Thanks , " Tom grunted , brushing leaves and dirt from his clothes . This one seemed real enough . <p> " Jesus , I 'm sorry , " the runner said . " I did n't see you . I guess I was in the zone . " <p> " It 's dark . " Tom absolved him . And I 've been in a zone of my own for a while . " Can you tell me the best way out of here ? " <p> " Let me rest a moment , and I 'll show you , " he said , breathing hard . He bent over and placed his hands on his knees . " I 'll take you out with me . " <p> " I do n't want to interrupt your run . " <p> " I was finishing , anyway . " He grabbed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face . " Buy you a cup of coffee ? It 's the least I can do . " <p> " No , thanks , I 'm all right . " <p> " Are you sure ? " <p> Tom thought about it for a moment . Just for a moment . <p> SO NOW HERE they were at an outdoor cafe on Amsterdam Avenue , under the streetlamps , and the breeze kept wafting the scent of the runner 's sweat Tom 's way , and Tom kept squirming in his seat because he could hardly stand it . He 's only doing this so I wo n't sue him , he thought . Worried he might have caused the old man some harm . His name was Jasper , and he was thirty-five and a pulmonologist , and he had an elegant , taut body that was all his own , not like the cookie-cutter Chelsea gym-boys Tom saw every day prowling up and down Eighth Avenue . Jasper was talking about his job and its stresses , but Tom was only half-listening . <p> " You should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom took his cigarette out of his mouth and said , " What ? " <p> " Smoke , " Jasper said . <p> " Oh , I 'm sorry , is it bothering you ? " Tom poised the cigarette over the ashtray , ready to snuff it out . <p> " The smoke does n't bother me . But if only you saw some of the lungs I get in my office . I mean , you really should quit . " <p> " I know I should . But go on , please . You were saying ? " <p> To Tom , it was the radiance of a guy like Jasper that spoke to the heart of the matter . Being gay - or straight for that matter - was n't about sex . It was about aesthetics , and each person 's own different appreciation of what constituted beauty . By which he did not mean that gay men had a stronger aesthetic sense . Not stronger , only different . Tom could look at women and understand that they were handsome and yet never feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something inside that said Yes ! Most of Tom 's gay friends had defined their lives by sex and their pursuit of it . For Tom , it was enough merely having coffee across from a kind of angel . <p> " I 'm rambling , sorry , " Jasper said . " What do you do ? " <p> " I 'm an architect , " Tom said . " A failed one . " <p> Jasper frowned , concerned . " Why do you say that ? " <p> " I have n't done any work in , what , five years . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> Why not , indeed . Tom was worried about getting into that . It scared most people off . But Jasper was a doctor ; he ought to understand about caring for people and the pain it left behind . On the other hand , once you showed your scars , you risked losing whatever beauty you might have had in the other 's eyes . <p> " I quit my job to take care of my lover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He had AIDS , and he needed constant care , most of the time , anyway . He had his ups and downs . Sometimes he was well enough to get out , but there were times .... You do n't really want to hear all this , do you ? " <p> " No , please , go on . " Jasper was listening intently . <p> " There were many times Eric was near death , but he always climbed back up . The virus was killing him , the drugs were killing him , and the opportunistic infections .... But I 'm sure you 've treated plenty of pneumocystis cases . " <p> Jasper nodded glumly . <p> " I wo n't go into the details of taking care of Eric . I do n't want to make myself out to be a martyr ... which I ca n't be , I guess ... not yet , anyway ... but I mean , some years ago , he was almost dead . He was ready to die . He had struggled so long , and he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I was ready for him to go , Tom thought . But he could never say such a thing to Jasper or to anyone . <p> " Then the protease inhibitors became available , and his doctor started him on triple combination therapy , and it was miraculous . He sprang back . The opportunistic infections went away , he gained weight and strength , his T cells went up , his viral load went down . He could go out again , and he started to hope again . We knew better , though . Ten years we had been dealing with it together . Still , the hope was there , and Eric lost some of his bitterness - " <p> " Was he bitter , really ? " <p> " Sometimes , " Tom said , and drank down the last of his coffee . " But it did n't last . Eric grew resistant to the protease inhibitor , and the doctor switched him to another one , and another one , but it did n't do any good . At the end , there just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developed resistance to . He slipped way back . It happened real fast . He got CMV and went blind , and then he had pneumocystis again for the first time in ages . And that was it . " <p> " I 'm sorry . That must be hard . How are you doing ? " <p> " I 'm negative , I 'm healthy , I 'm fine . " <p> " I mean emotionally . I was n't prying into your serostatus ! " <p> " I do n't mind telling you my status . Nothing 's going to happen to me . I 'm negative and intend to stay that way . " <p> " Do n't take this the wrong way , but when I ran into you in the park tonight , you did n't look so good . " <p> " Thanks a lot . " <p> " You look fine now , but when I saw you , you looked like you 'd - " <p> " Do n't say it , " Tom said . " But I think I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ghost , he wanted to say . He wanted to tell him . He wanted Jasper 's help . He needed it , needed help , anyway , and who else could he turn to but Jasper ? Edwin would be no use . But if he spoke about it with Jasper , he knew what would happen . Jasper would look at his watch and say he had to get going . He would ask Tom to give him a call , because he might be able to recommend a good psychotherapist . <p> " It 's getting late , " Tom said , getting up . When you suspected you were about to be dumped , it was always better to pull a sneak attack . " I 'm sorry , Jasper , I really must be going . Thanks for the coffee , though . " <p> " Wait , " Jasper said . " Let me at least give you this . " He pulled his wallet out of his fanny pack and produced a business card . " If you ever feel like you need to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will . Thanks . " <p> Just talk , Tom thought . Not " Let 's have a drink , " or " Would you like to have dinner sometime ? " or " I have to see you again ! " <p> That was the problem with beauty : It never saw you . <p> Edwin had left a message on Tom 's answering machine : " Tom , if you 're there , pick up . Oh , that 's right , you 're working . You probably do n't want to be disturbed while you 're working . I 'm back from the movies , and I 've been invited to a party . Very low-key , men our own age , thank goodness ! You do n't know the host , but he said I could bring you . He has this fabulous loft in TriBeCa , and he 's looking for someone to redo it , and he 's loaded . Might be a good gig for you , sweetcakes . And if not , at least you 'd meet some men ! What have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine . Call me . Or , look , I 'll give you the address , it 's 238 Duane Street . Come on by and tell them I sent you . " <p> Tom grabbed the last of the ice cream out of the freezer , but it was too hard to eat . He left it out on the counter . <p> The shifts were still billowing in Eric 's room . He still thought of it as Eric 's , even though he had reconverted it back into his study , and maybe that was part of the reason why his drafting table was gathering dust , why he kept turning down freelance work , why he never bothered to call back his former employers who were begging him to return . It was still Eric 's room , where he had breathed his last , and he was everywhere here , even if Tom had tried to cover him up . It was here that Tom had said , " We have to get you to the hospital , " and Eric had shook his head and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eric , for leaving me by myself . <p> Tom decided he should spend no more time in this room . It had been being here this afternoon that had got his imagination going . Maybe he was having an alcoholic flashback , after being dry for so long . That was possible , was n't it ? To go from drinking heavily to no booze at all , overnight , had been jarring enough . All these months later , could n't it catch up to his mind and make him see things that were n't there ? At one time or another , he had known all of those men ; they were stored away in his memory and could be conjured up in his dreams , so why not in a waking dream , when he was worn out from following the one he imagined was Eric ? Tom had been winded by the time he got to the Ramble . Not getting enough oxygen . Walking in a daze . The victim of an aging , addled mind . <p> Sometimes I hate you for being negative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , shortly after he had lost his eyesight . This is never going to happen to you . You 're going to find a new boyfriend and live to be a hundred , and someday you 'll get Alzheimer 's and forget all about me , I 'm telling you . <p> Tom closed the door to his study and locked it . <p> He had heard it said that lonely people lived in a world of their own making , that it was they who chose not to make friends . To a certain extent , he believed it to be true . Even after all his friends had died , he had had plenty of opportunities to make new ones . He had met people and made efforts to try to like them . But they all seemed like bad copies of other people he had known . None of them seemed real . The real ones were long gone . <p> That was why he could n't go to Edwin 's stupid party tonight . Men his own age . That meant men who either were going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle another Eric ) or were survivors themselves - the unwanted , the prudent , and the just plain lucky . Tom did n't want a friend like himself . He wanted a Jasper , one with youth and beauty and vitality still on his side - as long as Jasper would n't die on him . What are you saying ? You do n't even know if you 'll ever see him again . Tom placed Jasper 's card by the phone and promised himself he would call him tomorrow , after the Sun came up and things looked good again . To call now , while he was depressed , would only make him sound like a pathetic old queen . <p> I do n't want to ever be like that , Eric used to say , when he was young and healthy , when they spotted an elderly gay man on the street . Like Blondie says , " Die young , stay pretty . " <p> The ice cream had turned to soup . Tom drank it all , damning his too-high cholesterol , and threw the container @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment was too gloomy , and in fact he should think about moving . He would never find another rent like the one he was paying - not for a sunny floor-through two-bedroom in Chelsea - but perhaps he should move anyway , up to Inwood or to one of the outer boroughs or to a new city altogether - somewhere far away from all the old memories . <p> But he could n't solve that tonight . What he needed was a walk , through Chelsea and the West Village , among the living . <p> Back when Tom first moved to Chelsea , the Village was still the center of the gay universe , and he might as well have been moving to Poughkeepsie . Some of his friends back then even refused to venture north of the border at 14th Street . Tom had been staking out territory in the land of the Puerto Ricans , who made terrific neighbors and who tolerated him while muttering maricon and loca and puta under their breath . Now Chelsea was all but gay , with its own look that Tom was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was still his city , and these were the manhole covers beneath his feet , endlessly purging steam out into the night air . These were the sidewalks , shared by man and dog and hosed down by Cuban doormen and Mexican busboys . This was the cobblestone street no one had bothered to pave over , the stones roundly polished by a hundred years of motorcars , the Italian workmen who laid them long since laid to rest in rows even neater . That was the Empire State Building peeking over everything , upper floors illumined in Babylonian splendor . The World Trade Center was gone , but it had never really belonged . Edwin was the only one he had ever admitted these feelings to , and that had been a mistake . " I always hated it , " he 'd told him two days after the collapse . He 'd had to get it off his chest , and Edwin was the only person at hand : " It was so permanent , and I knew no one would ever bother to dismantle it , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And now that it 's gone , I feel guilty , as if it were somehow my fault . " Edwin had stared at him stupidly without saying anything , and no doubt he had shared this as a tidbit of gossip with anyone and everyone . <p> Tom tried to catch the eye of a man on Christopher Street - any man - with no luck . He passed two Hispanic youths wearing baggy shorts and baseball caps and earrings , looking like any other barrio boys until you heard them open their mouths , and out came that particular cadence of speech no straight man would ever wish to adopt . There was a forty-year-old black man in designer duds , with a beautiful face and elegant shoulders , wearing a subtle , sexy cologne , staring ahead , never noticing Tom . And a thirty-year-old white guy in a skin-tight T-shirt , leaning against a wall , smoking a cigarette , obviously looking for someone - but turning away as soon as his eyes met Tom 's . <p> Tom walked to the end of Christopher to West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or more . This was one street in Manhattan where you genuinely had to wait for the light to change before venturing off the curb . When it was safe , Tom hurried across , toward the broad Hudson River and the docks . <p> What am I doing here ? he asked himself . Why bother ? <p> A paved walkway ran along the river here , new within the last five years , stretching from Chelsea all the way down to Battery Park , with a demarcation line painted to keep the walkers on one side and the bicyclists on the other . Even at this hour , some people were hanging out , sitting on benches , listening to boom boxes , doing figure-eights on rollerblades , laughing , touching , enjoying each other 's company . <p> Tom walked north , toward the old docks . The lights along this stretch of the walkway were apparently burnt out and he saw no people here . Tom leaned against the waist-high concrete barrier at the river 's edge and looked out over the dark waters reflecting the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barrier to what was once Pier 49 or Pier 50 or Pier 51 - how was he to know ? They were crumbling , closed off by chainlink fencing and signs in red paint : WARNING - DANGER - KEEP OUT . If the mayor was dismantling them , Tom saw no sign of it-no cranes , no heavy equipment , no waste bins filled with debris . <p> Human debris , he thought , and distinctly heard Katherine Hepburn 's voice saying it - just another voice in his head . <p> " Hello again . " <p> This was n't in his head . It was from the Native American youngman whose hair was black as night . He was sitting on the concrete barrier , where a moment ago no one had been . He looked down at Tom and offered him a comely smile . <p> " Who are you ? " <p> " You know who I am , " the youngman said . " If you mean what 's my name , is n't it a little too late to ask ? " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from me ? " <p> " I told you already . I want you . " <p> " I do n't get it . Did Eric send you ? " <p> The youngman shrugged . " Who 's Eric ? " <p> Someday you 'll get Alzheimer 's and forget all about me . Tom was too young for Alzheimer 's - at least he thought so - but he wondered if he was experiencing some kind of dementia . His grandfather had seen people who were n't there , had carried on conversations with them , had watched football with them in his living room in Ohio , because of his dementia . Things like that ran in families , it was certainly possible , but then again .... <p> " Can you climb this ? " the youngman asked , indicating the tall chainlink fence behind him , beyond the concrete barrier . On the other side of the fence stretched a decrepit wooden pier . <p> " Eric 's angry because I 've outlived him , is that it ? " <p> " I told you I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> With that , the youngman swung his legs over the other side of the barrier and dropped down . He gripped the chain links and began climbing , seemingly without effort . But he was young . <p> " Come on ! " he called when he reached the top . <p> " I do n't know if I can , " Tom said , but he found that he wanted to . He had to know what it was all about . <p> " You can do it , Dad . It 's easy . " <p> Tom found it difficult enough getting over the concrete barrier . Once at the fence , he looked to see if he could find a gap , someplace where someone had cut the wires - but no . If he wanted to know , he would have to go over . Come on , the voice urged in his head . It 's easy . He had climbed fences like this plenty of times when he was young . It could n't be that hard . He breathed in deeply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other and was able to stick the toes of his sneakers into the holes to help himself up . He had to go up a ways and rest , go up a ways and rest , but at last he was at the top , precariously . <p> The youngman was gone . He must have made his way down the other side . The pier below was too dark for Tom to see him . <p> " Hey you , get down from there ! " <p> A voice from behind him - sounded like a cop-but Tom did n't look around . Too late to go back . The youngman wanted him . Come with me to the docks , he had said last night . Come . <p> Tom threw one leg over the top , and , maintaining a tight hold , managed to get the other leg over but scrambled desperately for a foothold . The fence was wobbling and swaying with his weight . One hand lost its grip . His feet found no purchase . He was hanging on by four Hingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toe of one shoe in the fence and grabbed on again with his other hand . He stayed there for a moment , catching his breath while his heart beat fiercely . He felt very old up here . <p> You took the last years of my youth , Tom thought - not for the first time . He had said it before , aloud , one day when he had utterly exhausted his supply of patience and compassion . He had said it to Eric , as he lay dying . Look at me , Eric . I gave up the best years of my life being with you and taking care of you . Staying true to you has kept me from being true to myself . It 's not the life I wanted . I want to be out there having fun . I feel like I 'm in a cage .... <p> If he did n't get down , he might lose his grip and fall to his death . He drummed up his courage , closed his eyes , and began his descent . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toes , while the fence warped and rattled . <p> He made it down to safety . The cars zoomed down West Street beyond , oblivious to him . He looked for whoever had told him to get down , but he saw no one along the walkway - no one at all . <p> " Youngman ! " Tom did n't know how else to call for him . <p> There was no way off the pier except to go back over the fence , and Tom was n't ready to try that again . The three other sides dropped off into the Hudson River , and he did n't feel foolish enough to jump in . He was stuck over here , and for what ? <p> Desperation . You 're so desperate , you 'd pursue sex with someone you screwed a quarter century ago on this dock and who must be dead , or he would n't be coming to you .... <p> " Youngman ? " <p> The water lapped against the piles . <p> " I 'm out here , " came the youngman 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more than a void extending into the subtly glimmering Hudson . <p> Venturing farther out seemed unwise . He could fall through an unseen hole and land on the rocks under the pier . The whole structure could collapse and take him with it . It was unsafe . <p> " Here , I 'll help you , " said a honey-smooth voice in his ear . <p> Tom turned with a start to find the blond youth beside him , the one with whom he had gone into the bushes at Stuyvesant Square , the one with the bragging T-shirt . <p> " No , " Tom said . " I want to go home . " <p> " Why ? " the blond asked . " No one wants you there . You do n't have any friends on that side . We 're all over here . Come . " <p> " But there 's Edwin - and ... and Jasper - " <p> " You hate Edwin , " the blond said . <p> " Jasper does n't love you , " said the raven-haired youngman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " <p> " That 's right . See for yourself . " <p> As Tom 's eyes adjusted to the darkness and he looked more closely , he saw that the pier was not made of worm-eaten wood after all . The entire length and breadth of the pier was teeming with sweaty male bodies slithering one atop the other like slippery seals basking in the sun , arms reaching out , hands caressing , legs contorting , backs arching , mouths meeting , buttocks rising .... It was hard to tell where one body began and the next ended , or whether they all made up a single , writhing mass . They made a humming , hungry drone of a sound . <p> Looking behind him toward West Street , Tom saw Eric standing on the other side of the chain-link fence , looking not a day older than that first day on Fire Island . It was easy to see why Tom had fallen for him . He had always been a dish . <p> " Eric ! " Tom grabbed the fence and shook it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other side . He did n't have to stay . He could climb back over , if he tried . Maybe that was what Eric wanted , and he was merely testing Tom to see which side he would choose . <p> " Eric , stay there . Please ! Wait for me ! " <p> Tom reached for the fence and began to climb . The raven-haired youth and the blond grabbed at him , but he pulled loose . The mass of men pressed up against the fence , reaching their arms toward the sky . Tom made it to a few feet below the top before he had to stop to catch his breath . He could n't , though . It was shallow , too shallow , and he felt light-headed . A sharp pain shot up his left arm , and it felt as if someone kicked him hard in the chest . He let go and began to fall , calling Eric 's name . <p> Sidebar                 @ @ @ @
