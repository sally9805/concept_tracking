On a wet summer night , Danny Coughlin , a Boston police officer , fought a four-round bout against another cop , Johnny Green , at Mechanics Hall just outside Copley Square . Coughlin-Green was the final fight on a fifteen-bout , all-police card that included flyweights , welterweights , cruiserweights , and heavyweights . Danny Coughlin , at six two , 220 , was a heavyweight . A suspect left hook and foot speed that was a few steps shy of blazing kept him from fighting professionally , but his butcher-knife left jab combined with the **27;913;TOOLONG explosion of his right cross dwarfed the abilities of just about any other semipro on the East Coast . <p> The all-day pugilism display was titled Boxing &amp; Badges : Haymakers for Hope . Proceeds were split fifty-fifty between the St. Thomas Asylum for Crippled Orphans and the policemen 's own fraternal organization , the Boston Social Club , which used the donations to bolster a health fund for injured coppers and to defray costs for uniforms and equipment , costs the department refused to pay . While flyers advertising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good neighborhoods and thereby elicited donations from people who never intended to actually attend the event , the flyers also saturated the worst of the Boston slums , where one was most likely to find the core of the criminal element  --  the plug-uglies , the bullyboys , the knuckle-dusters , and , of course , the Gusties , the city 's most powerful and fuck-out-of-their-minds street gang , who headquartered in South Boston but spread their tentacles throughout the city at large . <p> The logic was simple : <p> The only thing criminals loved almost as much as beating the shit out of coppers was watching coppers beat the shit out of each other . <p> Coppers beat the shit out of each other at Mechanics Hall during Boxing &amp; Badges : Haymakers for Hope . <p> Ergo : criminals would gather at Mechanics Hall to watch them do so . <p> Danny Coughlin 's godfather , Lieutenant Eddie McKenna , had decided to exploit this theory to the fullest for benefit of the BPD in general and the Special Squads Division he lorded over in particular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day mingling with the crowd , closing outstanding warrant after outstanding warrant with a surprisingly bloodless efficiency . They waited for a target to leave the main hall , usually to relieve himself , before they hit him over the head with a pocket billy and hauled him off to one of the paddy wagons that waited in the alley . By the time Danny stepped into the ring , most of the mugs with outstanding warrants had been scooped up or had slipped out the back , but a few  --  hopeless and dumb to the last  --  still milled about in the smoke-laden room on a floor sticky with spilt beer . <p> Danny 's corner man was Steve Coyle . Steve was also his patrol partner at the Oh-One Station House in the North End . They walked a beat from one end of Hanover Street to the other , from Constitution Wharf to the Crawford House Hotel , and as long as they 'd been doing it , Danny had boxed and Steve had been his corner and his cut man . <p> Danny , a survivor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had been held in high regard since his rookie year on the job . He was broad-shouldered , dark-haired and dark-eyed ; more than once , women had been noted openly regarding him , and not just immigrant women or those who smoked in public . Steve , on the other hand , was squat and rotund like a church bell , with a great pink bulb of a face and a bow to his walk . Early in the year he 'd joined a barbershop quartet in order to attract the fancy of the fairer sex , a decision that had served him in good stead this past spring , though prospects appeared to be dwindling as autumn neared . <p> Steve , it was said , talked so much he gave aspirin powder a headache . He 'd lost his parents at a young age and joined the department without any connections or juice . After nine years on the job , he was still a flatfoot . Danny , on the other hand , was BPD royalty , the son of Captain Thomas Coughlin of Precinct 12 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie McKenna . Danny had been on the job less than five years , but every cop in the city knew he was n't long for uniform . <p> " Fuckin ' taking this guy so long ? " Steve scanned the back of the hall , hard to ignore in his attire of choice . He claimed he 'd read somewhere that Scots were the most feared of all corner men in the fight game . And so , on fight nights , Steve came to the ring in a kilt . An authentic , red tartan kilt , red and black argyle socks , charcoal tweed jacket and matching five-button waistcoat , silver wedding tie , authentic gillie brogues on his feet , and a loose-crowned Balmoral on his head . The real surprise was n't how at home he looked in the getup , it was that he was n't even Scottish . <p> The audience , red-faced and drunk , had grown increasingly agitated the last hour or so , more and more actual fights breaking out between the scheduled ones . Danny leaned against the ropes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Smoke , thick and wet , curled around his arms . By all rights he should have been back in his dressing room , but he did n't really have a dressing room , just a bench in the maintenance hallway , where they 'd sent Woods from the Oh-Nine looking for him five minutes ago , told him it was time to head to the ring . <p> So he stood there in an empty ring waiting for Johnny Green , the buzz of the crowd growing louder , buzzier . Eight rows back , one guy hit another guy with a folding chair . The hitter was so drunk he fell on top of his victim . A cop waded in , clearing a path with his domed helmet in one hand and his pocket billy in the other . <p> <br> Continues ...
