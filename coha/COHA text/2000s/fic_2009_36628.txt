This time the dead animals were in human form . Frank Flynn stood on the side of the hill and looked across the Joshua tree flats at the place Lieutenant Dewey had described as the site of the murders . The crime scene investigators had come and gone , removing the bodies , the Jeep Wrangler , and the clues ; not much in the way of clues . Dewey had said nothing had been found that pointed to the shooter or shooters . That 's why he 'd asked Frank to look around , that and the grudging admission that Frank was really a part of law enforcement . Asking for help was an apology of sorts for past slights . <p> From the way Lieutenant Dewey had described the murder scene , one poacher , the one with the rifle , had been hit in the back of the head with a high-speed round that had taken away a quarter of his face and blown out the upper cheekbone and left eye . If the forensics people were able to find anything , Flynn would bet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probably the same kind of round that had killed the burros . He looked back at the road and beyond . The killer of men had hit the killer of burros in the back of the head , which meant that Frank was looking out over the part of the desert where the shooter had waited in ambush . A low outcropping of caprock ran along the crest of the far hill . It was a perfect place from which to take life without being detected , a sniper position . <p> Flynn picked out a high spot that was in line with where the Jeep had been and started down the slope to the road , keeping the rocks as a reference point . When he reached the outcropping , he turned to look back at the murder site . The dark volcanic ridge commanded a view of the Saline Valley Road , from where the road cut through the caprock down to the dry wash that divided the two hills and up the far side . It was about six hundred yards before the ground dropped away onto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Frank walked the ridgeline back to the road , a distance approaching two hundred yards , without seeing so much as a footprint . Returning to the beginning of his search , he moved along the ridge away from the road . He had n't gone more than fifty feet when he spotted an empty brass shell casing , glinting in the afternoon sun . Frank kept to the rocks so he would n't create tracks or disturb the scene . If there was a scene , it did n't amount to much . <p> Two depressions in the sandy soil at the base of a gently sloping rock face were the only telltales of human activity . At this point along the ridge , a shooter could take a prone position and be as good as invisible from the road . Frank lay down on the rock and placed his elbows as if holding a rifle . Sighting along the imaginary barrel , he found himself looking at the murder site . Only problem , he kept slipping backward down the smoothness of the rock face , until his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toes of the shooter 's boots must have been . He pushed up . The shooter had to be six or seven inches taller than Frank , a very tall person . He scanned the ground . Nothing he could call footprints , but there were some foot-sized disturbances taking a path across the desert toward Hunter Mountain . A trail-wise killer . He 'd wrapped his feet so there would n't be any identifiable tracks . <p> Frank examined the shell casing , a .270 . One shell casing , two corpses . The killer missed picking up the empty from the first shot . Oddly careless . Frank picked up the empty shell by inserting a twig in the opening where the slug and powder had been and slid it into a plastic bag . The second casing was probably still in the rifle . Something about the killer 's actions made him uneasy . <p> He 'd have to take a run over to Hunter Mountain . Probably would n't find a thing . Oh yeah , and he 'd better get in touch with Lieutenant Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nice . at trajectory , perfect for popping poachers . He felt the corners of his mouth lift into a smile . <p> Three days earlier , Frank had discovered a wounded burro and her foal not far from the site of the murders . He had ended the jenny 's suffering by putting a .45 round into her head as she struggled to lift herself from the sandy soil . His attempts to catch the orphaned foal had been futile , a circular chase ; the foal had kept a fixed distance between Frank and the lifeless jenny . There was no way to catch it by himself . He 'd had to temporarily abandon the foal until he could come back . <p> He 'd returned the following day with Molly Shannon , a BLM biologist who shared Frank 's affection for the clever creatures , hoping that the foal would still be alive . It had worked out about the way things work out  --  without resolution . He and the biologist had found no sign of the burro foal . They assumed it was probably dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Later a spiraling column of vultures had shown them where another adult burro lay decomposing in the summer heat . Frank was somehow relieved by this animal 's death because it meant the foal might still be alive . There was still a chance to save it . If he could n't save the foal , he was determined to catch the poachers . <p> The burro killings in the Mojave triggered a burning anger . Frank hated the mindless cruelty . The gun nuts were on a rampage , coming into the desert for a weekend of random slaughter , killing things for the pure joy of it . If there were a way to run the poachers down , he would spare no effort . He 'd returned later with a metal detector to see if he could find the spent slugs in the corpse , something tangible he could send to the forensics lab in Ashland , Oregon , that would make him feel better . He had met with no success . <p> As he made his way back to the road with his bagged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poachers with grim satisfaction . Someone had decided to even things out . The late afternoon sun was approaching the back wall of the Sierra Nevada . Soon the high plateau country would be washed in shades of flaming gold before plunging into the deep blues of night . A line of poetry ran through his head , " Though every prospect pleases and only man is vile . " He was angrier than he knew . <p> Excerpted from SHADOWS of DEATH by David Sundstrand <br> Copyright 2009 by David Sundstrand <br> Published in March 2009 by St. Martin ...
