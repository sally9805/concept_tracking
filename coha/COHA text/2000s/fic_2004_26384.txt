The Revenge of Randal Reese-Rat Chapter One Elizabeth Mad-Rat loved warm , tropical places , but the midday African sun was more than she could take . It might have been bearable if she could have stopped to rest in the shade of one of the strange-looking African trees along the roadside , but she had no time to spare . The ship shed come on , the SS Ratterdam , was leaving early the next morning to sail back to New York , and she was determined that she and her daughter should be on it . The sun was so powerful that Elizabeth finally lifted her traveling case up over her head as a parasol . Shed found the suitcase , a French cigarette box with a dancing gypsy on it , years ago on the island of Martinique . It wasnt heavy  --  there was nothing in it but her comb and a seashell shed picked up on a strip of beach on her way out of Dakar that morning  --  but her arms soon grew tired anyway . Im not as young a rat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally stopped in the shade of a palm tree and collapsed on her traveling case . Once she had caught her breath , she realized how parched she was , and , seeing a thick vine twisted around the tree trunk like a spiral staircase , she started up it in search of a coconut . Last year , in Jamaica , shed sipped some lovely milk from a broken coconut . But when she reached the top of the tree , there wasnt a coconut to be seen . Worse , even from way up there she couldnt make out the hill her daughter lived on . " This is terrible , " she muttered , realizing she must have taken a wrong turn on her way out of Dakar . " Im a total nincompoop . " " Is that what you are ? " said a squawky voice . " I wasnt sure . I thought maybe you were a rat . " If Elizabeth had nt grabbed on with her tail at the last second , she would have tumbled out of the tree . Perched only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green palm fronds , was an enormous green bird with a vicious-looking hooked bill . " Are total nincompoops native to Senegal ? " the bird asked . " I  --  I am a rat , " Elizabeth said shakily . " But Im not nearly as y-young and tasty as I once was . " The bird was bigger than a hawk , and for hawks rats were take-out food . But although the hooked bill looked capable of snipping her head off , the bird just blinked at Elizabeth and said : " Senegalese rat ? " " No , I 'm from ... well , I 'm not r-really from anywhere . I travel a lot . But originally I 'm from New York . " " New York . Is that near New Machavie ? " " Where 's New Machavie ? " " In the south . I met a marabou from there once . " " The south of Africa ? " said Elizabeth , who had no clue what a marabou was . " Of course . " " No , New York 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds juicy ! Nothing I like better than a snake breakfast . " " No , not United Snakes , United States . " " Oh . " The bird looked disappointed . " I do n't suppose states are as juicy . " " I have no idea , they 're something to do with human beings . " Elizabeth cleared her throat . " So you like to eat snake , but not rat ? " " No , I 'm wild about rat . Especially for lunch . " Elizabeth shot a panicky look up through the fronds . Judging by the sun , it was between two and three o'clock , which was late for lunch in most places  --  but maybe not in Africa . " It was l-lovely talking to you , " she said , starting to back down the twisty vine . " Why are you shivering , rat ? " " Am I shivering ? I must be ch-chilly . " " But it 's a hundred and one degrees Fahrenheit . Thirty-eight degrees Celsius . " The bird cocked his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking I 'd eat you . " " But you said ... " " I like the taste of rat , but I would n't dream of eating one . " " You ca n't digest them ? " Elizabeth said , stopping her descent . " No , I can digest anything , " the bird said , giving his feathers a quick preen . " My digestive system is as highly developed as my sense of temperature . I gave up rat out of respect for Maggie . " " Maggie ? Not Maggie Mad-Rat ? " " That 's the one . " Again Elizabeth nearly tumbled out of the tree  --  this time from surprise . " You know Maggie ? " " Everyone does . " " But she 's my daughter ! " " Is she really ? You must be very proud . " " Well , yes , " Elizabeth said uncertainly . " She 's one of a kind , our Maggie . " Elizabeth wondered what this meant  --  for the sad truth was , she knew very little about her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same New YorkDakar ship she 'd disembarked from that morning , after which she 'd spent a month in Dakar nursing the little ratling . This had been very hard on her  --  she had n't spent that long in one place in ages  --  and as soon as Maggie was old enough to travel , they 'd caught a ship to Belm , Brazil . But when Elizabeth had gotten ready to move on to Trinidad and Tobago , she 'd learned that her daughter was n't as mad for trekking to exotic , faraway places as she was . " I 'd like to go home , Mother , " Maggie had said . " Home ? " " Africa . " " But Africa 's not your home , sweetie . It 's just the first place you happened to put to shore , that 's all . " " It 's home to me . I love the open spaces , and the strong smells , and the animals  --  everything . " In the end they caught a ship back to Senegal . They found a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stump of a lightning-struck bakawana tree on top of a hill that was shaped like a giant sleeping rat . But once Elizabeth had helped Maggie settle in , she could n't hide her restlessness , and Maggie soon sent her on her way , assuring her that she could take care of herself . In the years since , Elizabeth had often meant to drop by for a visit  --  after all , Maggie was her only child  --  but the temptation to go somewhere new and different had always won out .
