Eat right , eat well-delicious meals that strike a balance in the face of diet extremes // Science and fashion-unusual bedfellows-meet in our culture of dieting . Trimming trends , usually claiming solid scientific support , cycle in and out of favor almost as fast as the seasons . One year complex carbohydrates reign ; the next year protein dominates weight-conscious menus and carbs are the enemy . Two principles , however , have survived this confusing roller-coaster ride of fad diets : balance and moderation . Dr. Barbara Schneeman , professor of nutrition at the University of California at Davis and assistant administrator for human nutrition for the USDA agricultural research service , affirms these basics : A healthy diet includes moderate portions of foods from all five major groups in the USDA food pyramid . The largest number of calories you consume should come from the base of the pyramid , the complex carbohydrates ( breads , cereals , rice , and pasta ) . Add to that generous amounts of vegetables and fruits and moderate amounts of dairy products ( milk , yogurt , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dry beans , eggs , and nuts ) . Indulge in fats and sweets sparingly . The secret to maintaining this balance over the long haul is to avoid letting moderation turn into monotony . With a little imagination , as in the ideas we offer here , weeknight meals can be highly varied without being time-consuming . They can also draw from all the food groupsand even veer toward high-protein or high-carb preferences-and still weigh in at less than 30 percent calories from fat , the amount recommended by the USDA and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services . The simple accompaniments suggested in the recipe notes turn each dish into an appealing , well-rounded meal . Consider this collection both blueprint and inspiration for a nutritious diet to last a lifetime .
