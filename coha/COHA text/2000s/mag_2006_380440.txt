When 21-year-old Web entrepreneur Alex Tew received a $50,000 ransom demand last month , he remembers thinking , " There 's no way on earth I 'm paying these guys . " Hackers had kidnapped Tew 's Million Dollar Homepage , an advertising website , crippling it with a flood of data . Thousands of dollars , six days and two security teams later , the site was back up . " I can understand why gambling sites that accept thousands of dollars a day could choose to pay and be done with it , " Tew says , " but I made a point of standing firm . " <P> As cyberextortion schemes become increasingly common , their targets have another choice : cyberinsurance . Demand for this emerging category of insurance , which will even cover a ransom payment , has jumped as more companies  --  and not just tech firms  --  depend on digital networks to do business . Written premiums topped $200 million in 2005 , up from $100 million in 2003 , according to Aon Financial Services Group managing director Kevin Kalinich , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addition to the hackers themselves . <P> The rise of the hacker as extortionist reflects a broader change in hacker culture . " It used to be teenagers looking for bragging rights , " says Johannes Ullrich , chief research officer for the SANS Institute , a security think tank . " Now it 's done for profit . " And it 's done from anywhere in the world , so catching the bad guys can be complicated . Ullrich estimates that there are 10 or 20 cases a day , compared with virtually none three years ago . More sophisticated viruses , spyware and other forms of malicious code , meanwhile , are the new weapons of choice for committing identity theft , bank fraud , even industrial espionage . Computer crime costs U.S. businesses an estimated $67.2 billion a year , according to the FBI . <P> There are two sides to cyberinsurance : first-party coverage helps companies recover losses owing to , say , a network outage . Many first-party policies also include payments to hackers holding your website or customer data hostage , says ACE USA underwriter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fails and someone sues . Annual premium payments range from $7,500 for a medium-size ( $25 million in sales ) company to hundreds of thousands of dollars for a multinational corporation , according to AIG . To qualify for coverage , companies must adhere to internationally accepted security standards . " You never know what you 're going to come up against , " says Moira Mooney , senior risk manager for InterActiveCorp , which owns several online businesses . " Having the insurance is a backstop . " <P> What has really kicked things off for the cyberinsurance market is new legislation , in effect in some 20 states , that requires companies to notify customers when their personal data may have been compromised . There were 134 such breaches last year , potentially affecting more than 57 million people , according to the Identity Theft Resource Center . " Companies used to bury this stuff , " says Chris Hoofnagle , senior counsel for the Electronic Privacy Information Center . Now that they must go public , buying insurance can reduce liability risk .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
