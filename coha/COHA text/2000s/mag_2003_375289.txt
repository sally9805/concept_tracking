How to Build a Better Democrat <P> Joe Klein hit the nail right on the head in his analysis of what the DEMOCRATIC Party must do to unseat George W. Bush in the 2004 presidential election NATION , May 19 . Democrats should wake up and stand for something instead of always being against things . Until they do , they will probably continue to lose ground to the Republicans . Think what you will about Bush , you ca n't say he 's afraid to state his beliefs and act on them . MARK RIOUX Saco , Maine <P> Klein 's story was witty and perceptive . Yet he missed the point . The real lesson of the 2000 election was that Democrats ca n't win by chasing Republicans further to the right . Both parties are going after the same voters . The key to a Democratic victory in 2004 is to target the half of the electorate that does n't vote , at least in part because these citizens see no credible alternative in the current 1 1/2-party system . What the Dems need is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " strong on defense , " but winning back disaffected progressive voters requires a candidate with the guts to forcefully denounce Bush and his gang . DOUG ABBOTT Silver City , N.M . <P> We Democrats are truly the " big tent " party , and as such , we are a much more diverse party than the Republicans . And because of this diversity , we Dems are often at odds with one another . We are a party that allows dissent , even thrives on it . Many consider this dissension a sign of weakness , and regard the G.O.P. , which tolerates little disagreement , as a party of strength . That view is wrong . The Democratic Party is the party from the heart of America . We represent Americans of every nationality , creed and religion . Could we do better ? No question . Can we do better than the Republicans and Bush ? Without a doubt . CHARLES TRANBERG Madison , Wis . <P> The Democrats have to fight on the Republicans ' turf . It 's time to get down and dirty , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Truth and a get-tough strategy have a chance . Business as usual would be another disaster . REGINA AVRAHAM New York City <P> Three simple questions can defeat Bush . First , is our society better off economically than it was four years ago ? Second , is the world better off and safer now than it was four years ago ? ( Does anyone truly feel comfortable taking an airplane trip to Europe ? ) Third , do we feel safer in the U.S. now that we have many fewer civil liberties than we did four years ago ? DALE HILL Washita , Okla . <P> The economy is weak , unemployment is up , the deficit is soaring and millions of people are without health care . Bush is eminently beatable in 2004 . The Democrats have plenty of ammo to go after him . They just have to stop acting like a rudderless bunch and go for the jugular . GARY SARTORI Concord , N.H. <P> Klein says Democrats need a large and overarching theme , a battle cry to win in 2004 . Luckily , Democrats have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans on education and Social Security , on health care for the elderly , on the economy and taxes , on living wages and job creation . To win in 2004 , Democrats should not run against Bush at all . Instead they should run against Republicans and all that the party stands for . BRUCE H. THORSTAD Dresser , Wis.
