Chapter One Chase Chandler walked out of the gate into Dulles International Airport and inhaled deeply . Each breath of air outside his hometown of Yorkshire Falls , New York , presented true freedom . At last . " Hey , big brother ! " His youngest sibling , Roman , pulled him into a bear hug . " Welcome to D.C. Good flight ? " " The best kind . Short and on time . " Chase hiked his duffel bag over his shoulder and started toward the exit . " How 's the wife ? " A ridiculous smile settled on Roman 's lips . " Charlotte 's amazing . Getting bigger by the day . My kid 's growing inside her , " he added , as if he had n't reminded them all of Charlotte 's pregnancy one hundred times before . " One month to go . " He rubbed his hands together in obvious anticipation . " Just recently a wife and kid was the last thing you wanted . We had to toss a coin to decide which of us would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look at you . A husband and soon-to-be dad , and happy about both . " Chase shook his head , amazed and pleased with the changes in his little brother . The kid was settled and happy , which made Chase happy . He 'd done his duty by his family . Roman shrugged . " What can I say ? That was before . Now I 'm a changed man . " " Before you grew up , you mean ? " Chase winked and his brother chuckled . Both men knew Roman had fought long and hard until he concluded that marrying Charlotte would n't mean giving up his foreign-correspondent lifestyle , merely trading it in for something more fulfilling . Now he had a job with the Washington Post as an op-ed columnist , a wife , and a family . " You have no idea what you 're missing , " Roman said , not missing a beat . " A woman to come home to , a warm body in bed , and someone who loves you unconditionally . " Like religious fanatics , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recently gotten hitched , had begun to preach the benefits of marriage . Chase was n't buying it . " Trust me , I can live without it , thank you very much . If I get that lonely , I 'll find myself a dog . " His dreams did n't include a wife and family . His brothers , as much as he loved them , had been a handful to raise . He did n't need little rugrats of his own . From the time he 'd turned eighteen and his father had unexpectedly passed away , Chase had been the male parent and role model . He 'd taken over as publisher of the Yorkshire Falls Gazette and helped his mother raise his brothers - both jobs he 'd never resented . Chase was not one to look back . And now , at thirty-seven , he was free to move on with a life of his own and grasp the dreams he 'd put on hold . Starting with this trip to Washington . He walked around a slow-moving couple and headed for the sign marked PARKING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't dulled and Chase grinned . " I guess I can call Mom and tell her you 're strutting around like a proud papa . " " Do n't bother , " Roman said , falling into step beside him . " When we 're not in Yorkshire Falls , she checks in once a day with Charlotte by phone . " Chase nodded . That was his mother , Raina , meddling and proud of it . " Well , I could n't be happier for you . " He patted his brother on the back . " And I 'm glad you 've left the paper in someone else 's hands and decided to put yourself first for once . " Chase answered Roman with a grunt . After all , the kid was right . Not once in the years since he 'd taken over had he abdicated responsibility for the Gazette . " The car 's parked in the lot . " Roman gestured in the direction they needed to go and Chase followed , nearly tripping over a young kid who 'd decided to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chase said , noticing that the wayward kid had been corralled by his parents . Roman and Rick had been eleven and fifteen , respectively , when their dad passed away . They 'd been old enough to take care of themselves and Chase had n't had to deal with their toddler years . Thank God . Their late teens had been tough enough . " How 's Mom ? " Roman asked . " What do you mean ? " " Her ... ah ... health . " " Stuttering for a reason ? " he asked . Roman picked up his pace but remained silent . Chase could almost see his brother 's brain churning to come up with a reply . A few months ago , Chase had rushed his mother to the emergency room with chest pains . Later , she 'd told her sons she 'd been diagnosed with a serious heart condition . Though they 'd spoken to the doctor , confidentiality had prevented them from finding out anything more than what Raina had told them . Her three sons had danced around her bedside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd curtailed all activity , Chase had n't thought to question the diagnosis further , until he began to notice inconsistencies in his mother 's behavior . Too much color in her cheeks for someone with a weak heart . Too much swigging of antacids . The more recent prescription drug to treat gastric reflux , which if left untreated could have severe consequences . And running up and down the stairs when she thought she would n't be caught . As a newspaperman with damn good instincts , he began to suspect blatant manipulation . He also suspected his brothers , who seemed less concerned with their mother 's health lately , knew something he did n't . " Rick and I need to talk to you , " Roman said . " About Mom 's fake heart condition ? " Roman stopped in his tracks , causing one woman to nearly bump into him and a man to dart around him , cursing as he passed . " You know ? " Chase nodded . " I do now . " " Shit . " Roman met his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Chase ran a hand through his hair and groaned . He did n't give a damn that they were in the middle of the airport blocking pedestrian traffic . He 'd been itching to confront Roman on this and was damn glad to have it off his chest . " Any reason I was left out ? " " I discovered the truth just before Charlotte and I got together for good . Rick figured things out more recently . If he could 've come to D.C. , we 'd have told you this weekend . " He held his hands out in front of him . " What can I say ? " " You do n't owe me an explanation . Mom does . " Roman raised an eyebrow . " You do n't know why she faked being sick ? " " Explanation 's the wrong word . I know she did it because she wanted grandkids . She wanted us to feel so bad we 'd do her bidding . I get that . But she damn well owes us all an apology . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have seriously curtailed her social life . She and Eric have n't been able to go dancing , date , do any of the things she 'd like to do . " " Small consolation . " Chase rolled his shoulders to release the tension . " What do you say we forget about the family problems this weekend and just have fun ? " " Sounds good to me . We 'll get you settled at the hotel , have dinner with Charlotte , and tomorrow you 'll get your first taste of D.C. politics . Let 's get the hell out of here . " " No argument from me . " Roman started for the elevators leading to the parking garage and Chase joined him . " I 'm not surprised Senator Carlisle 's going to run for vice president , " Chase said of the story that brought him to town . Roman nodded . " Me neither . The man 's political perfection , even on a second marriage . " Fortunately for Chase , Jacqueline Carlisle , the senator 's deceased wife , was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his hometown that led him to D.C. " With the current V.P. too old and unwilling to run again , our president needs a newer model . Someone with shine and polish . " " U.S. senator Michael Carlisle from New York , " Roman said . " Yep . I did research on the man . After Jacqueline , the first wife , died , Carlisle married her college roommate and best friend . Madeline Carlisle raised the senator 's first daughter , Sloane , then later Madeline and the senator had twins , Eden and Dawne . " Political perfection , as Roman had said . " Ever see photos of the senator 's oldest daughter ? " Chase shook his head . " Just a glimpse of the twins or a grainy background shot . Why ? " Roman laughed . " I just think you 'll like what you see . Elevator 's this way . " He pointed left . " From a professional standpoint , I like everything about the Carlisles . " Because barring scandal or stupidity , the high-profile , good-looking senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intended to use his local connection to make one helluva journalistic splash . Roman laughed . " You do realize that when I asked about Carlisle 's daughter , I was n't talking about work ? " He rolled his eyes . " Of course not . You 're always on top of things , always the professional . " He sobered . " You know , I learned from you . " The pride in his voice made Chase feel like a fraud . Roman had accomplished more in his lifetime than Chase ever had . " And you 're right , " Roman said , oblivious to Chase 's inner thoughts . " This story gives you the perfect opportunity to break out of small-town coverage . With the right angle , you could get picked up by one of the bigger papers . " At his brother 's words , Chase 's adrenaline began pumping in a way he could n't remember experiencing , not since he 'd stood at his father 's funeral and buried his dreams . But patience and family loyalty had paid off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid open and they stepped inside . " It just so happens , I have that right angle . The one that 'll put you ahead of the other guys following Carlisle 's scent . Want to know what I did n't tell you on the phone ? " Roman asked . " Sure . " Chase dropped his duffel to the floor and glanced at his brother , his body humming with anticipation . " Charlotte is friendly with Madeline Carlisle . She was a customer in her lingerie store here in D.C. , but they 've become friends . Good friends . Madeline does n't give many interviews , but I can get you an exclusive , one-on-one with the senator 's wife . " Roman 's eyes gleamed with excitement and Chase 's anticipation heightened , the thrill of a big story tantalizing him , arousing and heightening all his instincts . " Roman ? " His brother glanced up . " Yeah ? " Chase was n't a man comfortable or good at expressing his feelings . His brothers were used to his long silences . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Thanks . " Roman studied him through hooded eyes . " I 'd say I owe you this one , but you 'd probably haul off and deck me . Let 's just say you 're damn good , you deserve it , and leave it at that . " Chase nodded . " Fine by me . " " Last thing , " Roman said as the elevator door reopened and the dark parking garage appeared . " D.C. is n't just good for political intrigue . It 's got its share of willing women as well . " Chase frowned . " I thought you were happily married . " " I am . But you , big brother , are n't . " Sloane Carlisle attempted to pair her beloved fuchsia minidress with a staid black jacket , then cringed at the result . A Betsey Johnson original was meant to be seen , not covered . With regret , she relegated the outfit to the back of her closet along with the rest of her retro wear . She could n't possibly put on such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Not tomorrow , the day her senator father would announce his decision to accept the presidential candidate 's offer to be his running mate in the next election . She sighed and pulled out a powder blue Chanel suit and laid it on her bed . Though not her preference , the conservative choice was much more appropriate for Senator Carlisle 's oldest daughter . Although Sloane often felt like the odd sibling out in a political family that enjoyed the spotlight , she understood the necessity for thinking before she dressed , spoke , or acted , just in case the press was sniffing out a story . And Sloane always performed as her family expected . Twenty minutes later and half an hour early , she stood outside her father 's hotel suite . Her parents had set up temporary residence in the D.C. hotel , leaving their home in New York State behind . And now they planned one last intimate family gathering before the media frenzy began . She was about to knock when the sound of angry whispers carried toward her . " I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disintegrate before my eyes . " She recognized the voice of Franklin Page , her father 's campaign manager , right-hand man , and longtime friend . Frank frequently overreacted in order to prevent a crisis , and his bellowing did n't frighten her now . She raised her hand to knock on the door , which had been left open a sliver , when Frank 's assistant , Robert Stone , spoke , preventing her from intruding . " You say this Samson man claims to be Sloane 's father ? " He snorted , his disbelief evident . " He more than claims . " Sloane sucked in a startled breath and clenched her fists . His words could n't possibly be true . Jacqueline and Michael Carlisle were her biological parents . She had no reason to believe otherwise . But her stomach rolled and nausea threatened . " Does he have proof ? " Robert asked in a voice so low Sloane had to strain to hear and she missed Frank 's reply . " Does n't need any . Michael verified it . " Frank spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He just refuses to act in his own best interest and do anything about this Samson person . " A brief pause followed . " Dammit , do n't you know better than to leave the door open ? Michael and Madeline will be back from shopping any minute . He ca n't hear what we have planned . " " Which is ? " " Give us some privacy and I 'll explain everything . This man Samson is a threat to the campaign . And any threat has to be eliminated . " Frank bellowed , but he never made idle threats . Sloane swallowed hard just as the door slammed shut in her face , leaving her on the outside of her father 's suite and , if Frank 's words were true , on the outside of her own life . By the time dinner finally ended , Chase had had more of his brother and sister-in-law 's matrimonial happiness than he could stomach in one sitting . While Roman took a tired Charlotte home , Chase decided to check out the D.C. nightlife and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the perfect hole-in-the-wall bar around the corner from his hotel where he could kick back and relax . He ordered a Miller Genuine Draft and took in the scenery , which consisted of a pool table , a small , scarred dance floor , varied beer signs hanging on old paneled walls , and not much else . Until the door opened and she walked inside , a vision in a dress so pink , so short , so bare , it ought to be illegal . No matter what his brother thought , Chase was n't a monk . He 'd just kept his social life discreet in deference to his fatherlike status , and over the years , the habit stuck . Most recently he 'd hooked up with Cindy Dixon , who lived in Hampshire , the next town over . They were friends who 'd begun sleeping together when the whim struck , neither wanting to be indiscriminate in this day and age . The arrangement satisfied Chase physically , but no longer inspired him , so he was n't surprised when this sexy siren captured his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waves , making him itch to run his fingers through the unruly strands .
