A House Besieged There was another fog , far away from the smog of Corvere . Six hundred miles to the north , across the Wall that separated Ancelstierre from the Old Kingdom . The Wall where the Old Kingdom s magic really began and Ancelstierre 's modern technology failed . This fog was different from its far-southern cousin . It was not white but the dark grey of a storm cloud , and it was completely unnatural . This fog had been spun from air and Free Magic and was born on a hilltop far from any water . It survived and spread despite the heat of a late-spring afternoon , which should have burned it into nothing . Ignoring sun and light breezes , the fog spread from the hill and rolled south and east , thin tendrils creeping out in advance of the main body . Half a league on from the hill , one of these tendrils separated into a cloud that rose high in the air and crossed the mighty river Ratterlin . Once across , it sank to sit like a toad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ puff out of it . Soon the two arms of fog shrouded both western and eastern shores of the Ratterlin , though the sun still shone on the river in between . Both river and fog sped at their very different paces towards the Long Cliffs . The river dashed along , getting faster and faster as it headed to the great waterfall , where it would plunge down more than a thousand feet . The fog was slow and threatening . It thickened and rose higher as it rolled on . A few yards before it reached the Long Cliffs , the fog stopped , though it still grew thicker and rose higher , threatening the island that sat in the middle of the river and on the edge of the waterfall . An island with high white walls that enclosed a house and gardens . The fog did not spread across the river , nor lean in too far as it rose . There were unseen defenses that held it back , that kept the sun shining on the white walls , the gardens , and the red-tiled house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the first move in a battle , only the beginning of a siege . The battle lines were drawn and the House invested . For the whole river-circled isle was Abhorsen 's House . Home to the Abhorsen , whose birthright and charge was to maintain the borders of Life and Death . The Abhorsen , who used necromantic bells and Free Magic , but who was neither necromancer nor Free Magic sorcerer . The Abhorsen , who sent any Dead who trespassed in Life back to whence they came . The creator of the fog knew that the Abhorsen was not actually in the House . The Abhorsen and her husband , the King , had been lured across the Wall and would presumably be dealt with there . That was part of her Master 's plan , long since laid but only recently begun in earnest . The plan had many parts , in many countries , though the very heart and reason for it lay in the Old Kingdom . War , assassination , and refugees were elements of the plan , all manipulated by a scheming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come to fruition . But as with any plan , there had already been complications and problems . Two of them were in the House . One was a young woman , who had been sent south by the witches who lived in the glacier-clad mountain at the Ratterlin 's source . The Clayr , who Saw many futures in the ice , and who would certainly try to twist the present to their own ends . The woman was one of their elite mages , easily identified by the colored waistcoat she wore . A red waistcoat , marking her as a Second Assistant Librarian . The maker of the fog had seen her , black haired and pale skinned , surely no older than twenty , a mere fingernail sliver of an age . She had heard the young woman 's name , called out in desperate battle . Lirael . The other complication was better known , and possibly more trouble , though the evidence was conflicting . A young man , hardly more than a boy , curly haired from his father , black eyebrowed from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sameth , the royal son of King Touchstone and the Abhorsen Sabriel . Prince Sameth was meant to be the Abhorsen-in-Waiting , heir to the powers of The Book of the Dead and the seven bells . But the maker of the fog doubted that now . She was very old , and once she had known a great deal about the strange family and their House in the river . She had fought Sameth barely a night past , and he had not fought like an Abhorsen ; even the way he cast his Charter Magic was strange , reminiscent of neither the royal line nor the Abhorsens . Sameth and Lirael were not alone . They were supported by two creatures who appeared to be no more than a small bad-tempered white cat and a large black and tan dog of friendly disposition . Yet both were much more than they seemed , though exactly what they were was another slippery piece of information . Most likely they were Free Magic spirits of some kind , bound in service to the Abhorsen and the Clayr . The cat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there was speculation about him in certain books of lore . The Dog was a different matter . She was new , or so old that any book that told of her was long since dust . The creature in the fog thought the latter . Both the young woman and her hound had come from the Great Library of the Clayr . It was likely both of them , like the Library , had hidden depths and contained unknown powers . Together , these four could be formidable opponents , and they represented a serious threat . But the maker of the fog did not have to fight them directly , nor could she , for the House was too well guarded by both spell and swift water . Her orders were to make sure that they were trapped in the House . The House was to be besieged while matters progressed elsewhere - until it was too late for Lirael , Sam , and their companions to do anything at all .                 @ @ @ @
