<p> SITGES , Spain - The road , followed far enough , slopes onto a cobblestone sidewalk , then a sandy beach replete with volleyball players and finally a breathtakingly expanse of Mediterranean blue . From where we stood , though , outside a tidy whitewashed house with green shutters , you could not so much see the water as you could smell it : the scent of endless sea . <p> My mother sniffed the air and smiled . She had come full circle , returned with her daughters to the house she had been born in , to the block where she had played so many games of hide-and-seek . I knew she was pleased . <p> We were posing for photographs , her cousins directing us away from the long shadows cast by the dying light of that July day , when an older woman in beach shoes and tunic turned the corner . Greeting my relatives , she stopped and set her lawn chair down to watch our little performance . Then , in a sudden moment of recognition , she gasped . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My mother 's name . More than 50 years ago , they had been playmates . <p> My sisters and I exchanged knowing looks . This - this and many other similar encounters - was why we had rearranged vacations , left our families behind , and spent money earmarked for other things to fly across the Atlantic to bring our mother home . We knew it was a trip that comes once in a lifetime . <p> Last summer , we took my mother back to Sitges , a seaside town on the Costa Daurada less than an hour south of Barcelona . She spent the first 10 years of her life there before immigrating to Cuba with her widowed mother and an older sister . Back then , during the Spanish Civil War and into the 1940s ( when she left ) , Sitges was a small port village with homes and a few hotels stretching past the shore . <p> A palm-studded beach promenade ended , as it does today , at the foot of the stairs leading to perhaps the town 's most recognizable silhouette , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was baptized there , and my grandfather is buried in the town cemetery walking distance away . ) <p> To hear her tell it , everyone in town used to know each other . The street her old house stands on was named for an uncle ; the neighborhood bore her family 's name . Children played on the road , darting into empty lots and ravines but usually within shouting distance of their parents ' shops and offices . <p> Today , Sitges is a ritzy resort , immensely popular with European gays . In August , the small downtown area closes to vehicular traffic . Pedestrians , in various modes of undress , stroll along narrow , light-dappled streets . <p> It is not unusual to come across a topless sunbather on the beach , not far from the shadow of the parish church , a sight that does n't even warrant a second glance these days . And if you were to calculate real estate appreciation , her old house , now owned as a vacation home by a family in Barcelona , is worth a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the span of half a century on every trip home . She returned many times - alone , with my father , with her sister , with my two youngest siblings - and even lived there for about a year after she fled Fidel Castro with her three oldest children . This trip , though , was different . It would be her last , a final goodbye . <p> When my mother was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in May of 2001 , we never imagined she would get the chance to see her relatives again . Her weakening health ruled out a sojourn across the ocean , but eventually a cousin 's daughter 's wedding in Barcelona proved too big of a temptation . She was determined to go for the celebration and , perhaps more important , write an ending to her own story . <p> Traveling with a sick person is no easy feat , and it requires considerable planning for even the most insignificant detail . You also run the risk of encountering a medical emergency far from home , where the health system is unfamiliar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Knowing that , my sisters - one a pharmacist and the other a lawyer - made a comprehensive list that included not only a detailed trip itinerary with phone numbers but also names and dosages of her medication and a schedule of when she needed to take them . This was copied and distributed to everybody in the family , including my two brothers , who were not traveling with us . <p> Because my mother was on twice-a-day shots of a blood-thinner , we also asked her doctor for a letter explaining the 20-plus syringes we had packed in our carry-on bag . Some of her medication needed to be kept refrigerated , too , so she devised a tiny cooler from a Thermos , and a family friend lent us a portable wheelchair , a space-saving device that proved a godsend . <p> It was n't an exaggeration to say that I felt like a portable pharmacy for most of the trip . <p> I left Miami with my mother one hot July day . Our first stop was Lourdes , France , in the western Pyrenees in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lourdes , my mother wanted to bathe and drink from the sanctuary 's healing waters . There , we were joined by my middle sister and her oldest daughter for a short weekend that proved to be less about faith and religion and more about resting for what was to come . <p> From Lourdes , we crossed the Pyrenees in a rented van , an almost seven-hour trip through some rough terrain , up green mountains and then down again , winding east and south , wending our way from the staccato French and the indecipherable Basque language to the more guttural Catalan . On the way , we saw acres upon acres of wooded land rising into the sky , bubbling brooks and crystal clear streams , stone houses , flower gardens and factory plants , ski lifts and , of course , a few cars and trucks . <p> When we arrived in Barcelona , a group of cousins waited on the sidewalk in front of our hotel . They had taken over a bus stop on this busy main street , a few blocks from where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother into her wheelchair and adjusted her wig for photographs , the chattering children brought forth a small glass aquarium abloom with pink roses . <p> Passersby paused to take in the scene ; a taxi honked . If I had doubted it before , I knew then that we had made the right choice in bringing my mother back . <p> Though Barcelona is a city designed for the senses , we discovered that my mother felt too weak for the usual round of sites . She preferred to spend her time with the wife of my father 's cousin , whom she had known all her life , and her children , whom she had watched grow up . Our days were sedate and slow , marked by the simple pleasures of family and food . <p> At the buffet breakfast in the lobby , we gorged on the traditional Spanish breakfasts she had taught us to eat - Pan Con Tomate ( bread with tomato and olive oil ) - and though she could barely finish her portion , she enjoyed vicariously when we went for second and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , she would comment on the Tibidabo looming before us , a hill that is home , strangely enough , to a church , an enormous figure of Christ , an amusement park and a museum of automated toys . Or she would point toward the Barceloneta , a very old part of the city where , a long , long time ago , our ancestors waited for the day 's catch brought in by the fishing fleet . <p> Once we realized she was not particularly interested in sightseeing , we quickly came up with a plan . While one of us would stay with her , the rest of the group would run around to different places : Las Ramblas , the famous flower-dotted promenade ; La Sagrada Familia , a very unconventional church created by Antonio Gaudi ; and the Barri Gotic ( Gothic Quarter ) , an ancient city neighborhood . <p> One Sunday we traveled to Montserrat , the area 's highest peak that is the setting for a monastery and a basilica that houses the small wooden statue of La Moreneta , the black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end of each day , my mother would always ask us for details . She was apologetic about her lack of energy but delighted in my niece 's stories about going to the beach , walking Las Ramblas , riding the tour bus . <p> " What do you think , what do you think ? " she would prod the teenager . <p> In Barcelona , we rented a car and drove to Sitges . We met the family - an assortment of first cousins and their children - one morning and sat around talking past lunch . From the balcony of the apartment , she could see how much Sitges had changed in the three years since she had last visited , spreading into the hills and beyond . <p> In the later afternoon , when the glare of the sun had waned , we took her in the wheelchair to her childhood haunts : the beach near the church , the bakery for sweets , the corner where her family 's shoe factory had stood before the Civil War and , of course , her old house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much from exhaustion as , I hope , from satisfaction . <p> With my mother , we also went to La Canonja , a little town outside the capital of Tarragona , where my paternal grandfather 's people still live , most of them in the same building for several generations . <p> This time , as in other years , we did not venture to the Roman ruins a short drive away or to Cava Country , the wine-producing region between Barcelona and Tarragona . Instead , we spent the day with family , exchanging stories , meeting the younger children , or - as my niece would say - " chilling out . " <p> The cousin 's wedding in Barcelona was the final event we attended , all of us girls - grown women , really - in long , formal dresses , including my mother in the black sateen skirt she had bought for the occasion . We have photographs of ourselves around her in the wheelchair , the new bride in the middle , smiling broadly , preening at the camera , not knowing that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My mother fell sick on the flight home . While my youngest sister waited for our bags at the airport , bracing for my father 's reaction , I rode with her in the ambulance to the hospital . She died three days later in the middle of the night , when the morning sun was just staining the Catalonian skies pink and red and orange . She had held on as long as she could , as long as it took her to return home . <p> For the longest while , though , I was angry that she had not had been granted a few more days , at least enough time to tell my father about the trip or to show the rest of the family the photographs we had taken . Sometimes , too , I would look back at those 10 days - the wordless moments on the plane , the quiet times lying beside her in bed - and chastise myself for not repeatedly assuring her that this long voyage across an ocean was n't about doing the tourist thing but about saying goodbye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> But now a season has passed , and the photographs - most of them taken around food-laden family tables - have been stored in albums and scrapbooks . Enough time has passed that , on the rare occasion I browse through them , I am looking not so much at the pictures of a summer vacation , of a trip somewhere , but at the priceless gift of a last chance .
