Tuesday The road to Rake Field ran beside the school , past the old band hall and the tennis courts , through a tunnel of two perfect rows of red and yellow maples planted and paid for by the boosters , then over a small hill to a lower area covered with enough asphalt for a thousand cars . The road stopped in front of an immense gate of brick and wrought iron that announced the presence of Rake Field , and beyond the gate was a chain-link fence that encircled the hallowed ground . On Friday nights , the entire town of Messina waited for the gate to open , then rushed to the bleachers where seats were claimed and nervous pregame rituals were followed . The black , paved pasture around Rake Field would overflow long before the opening kickoff , sending the out-of-town traffic into the dirt roads and alleys and remote parking zones behind the school 's cafeteria and its baseball field . Opposing fans had a rough time in Messina , but not nearly as rough as the opposing teams . Driving slowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly because he had not been back in many years , slowly because when he saw the lights of the field the memories came roaring back , as he knew they would . He rolled through the red and yellow maples , bright in their autumn foliage . Their trunks had been a foot thick in Neely 's glory days , and now their branches touched above him and their leaves dropped like snow and covered the road to Rake Field . It was late in the afternoon , in October , and a soft wind from the north chilled the air . He stopped his car near the gate and stared at the field . All movements were slow now , all thoughts weighted heavily with sounds and images ofanother life . When he played the field had no name ; none was needed . Every person in Messina knew it simply as The Field . " The boys are on The Field early this morning , " they would say at the cafs downtown . " What time are we cleaning up The Field ? " they would ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new visitors ' bleachers at The Field , " they would say at the boosters ' meeting . " Rake 's got ' em on The Field late tonight , " they would say at the beer joints north of town . No piece of ground in Messina was more revered than The Field . Not even the cemetery . After Rake left they named it after him . Neely was gone by then , of course , long gone with no plans to return . Why he was returning now was n't completely clear , but deep in his soul he 'd always known this day would come , the day somewhere out there in the future when he was called back . He 'd always known that Rake would eventually die , and of course there would be a funeral with hundreds of former players packed around the casket , all wearing their Spartan green , all mourning the loss of a legend they loved and hated . But he 'd told himself many times that he would never return to The Field as long as Rake was alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , were the two practice fields , one with lights . No other school in the state had such a luxury , but then no other town worshiped its football as thoroughly and collectively as Messina . Neely could hear a coach 's whistle and the thump and grunts of bodies hitting each other as the latest Spartan team got ready for Friday night . He walked through the gate and across the track , painted dark green of course . The end zone grass was manicured and suitable for putting , but there were a few wild sprigs inching up the goalpost . And there was a patch or two of weeds in one corner , and now that he 'd noticed Neely looked even closer and saw untrimmed growth along the edge of the track . In the glory days dozens of volunteers gathered every Thursday afternoon and combed The Field with gardening shears , snipping out every wayward blade of grass . The glory days were gone . They left with Rake . Now Messina football was played by mortals , and the town had lost its swagger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gentleman who committed the sin of stepping onto the sacred Bermuda grass of The Field . The gentleman backtracked quickly , then walked around the sideline , and when he drew closer Rake realized he had just cursed the Mayor of Messina . The Mayor was offended . Rake did n't care . No one walked on his field . The Mayor , unaccustomed to being cursed , set in motion an ill-fated effort to fire Rake , who shrugged it off . The locals defeated the Mayor four to one as soon as his name appeared on the next ballot . In those days , Eddie Rake had more political clout in Messina than all the politicians combined , and he thought nothing of it . Neely stuck to the sideline and slowly made his way toward the home stands , then he stopped cold and took a deep breath as the pregame jitters hit him hard . The roar of a long-ago crowd came back , a crowd packed tightly together up there , in the bleachers , with the band in the center of things blaring away with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sideline just a few feet away , he could see number 19 nervously warming up as the mob worshiped him . Number 19 was a high school all-American , a highly recruited quarterback with a golden arm , fast feet , plenty of size , maybe the greatest Messina ever produced . Number 19 was Neely Crenshaw in another life . He walked a few steps along the sideline , stopped at the fifty where Rake had coached hundreds of games , and looked again at the silent bleachers where ten thousand people once gathered on Friday nights to pour their emotions upon a high school football team . The crowds were half that now , he 'd heard . Fifteen years had passed since number 19 had thrilled so many . Fifteen years since Neely had played on the sacred turf . How many times had he promised himself he would never do what he was now doing ? How many times had he sworn he would never come back ? On a practice field in the distance a coach blew a whistle and someone was yelling , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drum corps of the band , and the raspy , unforgettable voice of Mr. Bo Michael on the public address , and the deafening sound of the bleachers rattling as the fans jumped up and down . And he heard Rake bark and growl , though his coach seldom lost his cool in the heat of battle . The cheerleaders were over there -- bouncing , chanting , short skirts , tights , tanned and firm legs . Neely had his pick back then . His parents sat on the forty , eight rows down from the press box . He waved at his mother before every kickoff . She spent most of the game in prayer , certain he would break his neck . The college recruiters got passes to a row of chair-backed seats on the fifty , prime seating . Someone counted thirty-eight scouts for the Garnet Central game , all there to watch number 19 . Over a hundred colleges wrote letters ; his father still kept them . Thirty-one offered full scholarships . When Neely signed with Tech , there was a press conference and headlines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town with a population of eight thousand . The math had never worked . But they piled in from the county , from out in the sticks where there was nothing else to do on Friday night . They got their paychecks and bought their beer , and they came to town , to The Field where they clustered in one raucous pack at the north end of the stands and made more noise than the students , the band , and the townsfolk combined . When he was a boy , his father had kept him away from the north end . " Those county people " down there were drinking and sometimes fighting and they yelled foul language at the officials . A few years later , number 19 adored the racket made by those county people , and they certainly adored him . The bleachers were silent now , waiting . He moved slowly down the sideline , hands stuck deep in his pockets , a forgotten hero whose star had faded so quickly . The Messina quarterback for three seasons . Over a hundred touchdowns . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to him , though he tried to block them out . Those days were gone , he told himself for the hundredth time . Long gone . In the south end zone the boosters had erected a giant scoreboard , and mounted around it on large white placards with bold green lettering was the history of Messina football . And thus the history of the town . Undefeated seasons in 1960 and 1961 , when Rake was not yet thirty years old . Then in 1964 The Streak began , with perfect seasons for the rest of that decade and into the next . A month after Neely was born in 1970 , Messina lost to South Wayne in the state championship , and The Streak was over . Eighty-four wins in a row , a national record at that time , and Eddie Rake was a legend at the age of thirty-nine . Neely 's father had told him of the unspeakable gloom that engulfed the town in the days after that loss . As if eighty-four straight victories were not enough . It was a miserable winter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went 13-0 and slaughtered South Wayne for the state title . Other state championships followed , in ' 74 , ' 75 , and ' 79 . Then the drought . From 1980 until 1987 , Neely 's senior year , Messina went undefeated each season , easily won its conference and playoffs , only to lose in the state finals . There was discontent in Messina . The locals in the coffee shops were not happy . The old-timers longed for the days of The Streak . Some school in California won ninety in a row and the entire town of Messina was offended . To the left of the scoreboard , on green placards with white lettering , were the tributes to the greatest of all Messina heroes . Seven numbers had been retired , with Neely 's 19 being the last . Next to it was number 56 , worn by Jesse Trapp , a linebacker who played briefly at Miami then went to prison . In 1974 , Rake had retired number 81 , worn by Roman Armstead , the only Messina Spartan to play in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house that any small college would envy . It had a weight room and lockers and a visitors ' dressing room with carpet and showers . It too was built by the boosters after an intense capital campaign that lasted one winter and consumed the entire town . No expense was spared , not for the Messina Spartans football team . Coach Rake wanted weights and lockers and coaches ' offices , and the boosters practically forgot about Christmas . There was something different now , something Neely had not seen before . Just past the gate that led to the field house there was a monument with a brick base and a bronze bust on it . Neely walked over to take a look . It was Rake , an oversized Rake with wrinkles on the forehead and the familiar scowl around the eyes , yet just a hint of a smile . He wore the same weathered Messina cap he 'd worn for decades . A bronze Eddie Rake , at fifty , not the old man of seventy . Under it was a plaque with a glowing narrative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Messina could rattle off from memory -- thirty-four years as Coach of the Spartans , 418 wins , 62 losses , 13 state titles , and from 1964 to 1970 an undefeated streak that ended at 84 . It was an altar , and Neely could see the Spartans bowing before it as they made their way onto the field each Friday night . The wind picked up and scattered leaves in front of Neely . Practice was over and the soiled and sweaty players were trudging toward the field house . He did n't want to be seen , so he walked down the track and through a gate . He climbed up thirty rows and sat all alone in the bleachers , high above Rake Field with a view of the valley to the east . Church steeples rose above the gold and scarlet trees of Messina in the distance . The steeple on the far left belonged to the Methodist church , and a block behind it , unseen from the bleachers , was a handsome two-story home the town had given to Eddie Rake on his fiftieth birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughters and all the rest of the Rakes were now gathered , waiting for the Coach to take his last breath . No doubt the house was full of friends , too , with trays of food covering the tables and flowers stacked everywhere . Were any former players there ? Neely thought not . The next car into the parking lot stopped near Neely 's . This Spartan wore a coat and tie , and as he walked casually across the track , he , too , avoided stepping onto the playing surface . He spotted Neely and climbed the bleachers . " How long you been here ? " he asked as they shook hands . " Not long , " Neely said . " Is he dead ? " " No , not yet . " Paul Curry caught forty-seven of the sixty-three touchdown passes Neely threw in their three-year career together . Crenshaw to Curry , time and time again , practically unstoppable . They had been cocaptains . They were close friends who 'd drifted apart over the years . They still called each other three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first Messina bank , so his future had been sealed at birth . Then he married a local girl from another prominent family . Neely was the best man , and the wedding had been his last trip back to Messina . " How 's the family ? " Neely asked . " Fine . Mona 's pregnant . " " Of course she 's pregnant . Five or six ? " " Only four . " Neely shook his head . They were sitting three feet apart , both gazing into the distance , chatting but preoccupied . There was noise from the field house as cars and trucks began leaving . " How 's the team ? " Neely asked . " Not bad , won four lost two . The coach is a young guy from Missouri . I like him . Talent 's thin . " " Missouri ? " " Yeah , nobody within a thousand miles would take the job . " Neely glanced at him and said , " You 've put on some weight . " " I 'm a banker and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Paul stopped quickly , sorry that he 'd blurted out the last phrase . Neely 's left knee was twice the size of his right . " I 'm sure you can , " Neely said with a smile . No harm done . They watched the last of the cars and trucks speed away , most of them squealing tires or at least trying to . A lesser Spartan tradition . Then things were quiet again . " Do you ever come here when the place is empty ? " Neely asked . " I used to . " " And walk around the field and remember what it was like back then ? " " I did until I gave it up . Happens to all of us . " " This is the first time I 've come back here since they retired my number . " " And you have n't given it up . You 're still living back then , still dreaming , still the all-American quarterback . " " I wish I 'd never seen a football . " " You had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when we were in the sixth grade . Four teams -- red , blue , gold , and black , remember ? No green because every kid wanted to wear green . We played Tuesday nights and drew more fans than most high schools . We learned the same plays Rake was calling on Friday night . The same system . We dreamed of being Spartans and playing before ten thousand fanatics . By the ninth grade Rake himself was supervising our practices and we knew all forty plays in his book . Knew them in our sleep . " " I still know them , " Neely said . " So do I. Remember the time he made us run slot-waggle-right for two solid hours in practice ? " " Yeah , because you kept screwin ' up . " " Then we ran bleachers until we puked . " " That was Rake , " Neely mumbled . " You count the years until you get a varsity jersey , then you 're a hero , an idol , a cocky bastard because in this town you can do no wrong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of your own little world , then poof , it 's gone . You play your last game and everybody cries . You ca n't believe it 's over . Then another team comes right behind you and you 're forgotten . " " It was so long ago . " " Fifteen years , pal . When I was in college , I would come home for the holidays and stay away from this place . I would n't even drive by the school . Never saw Rake , did n't want to . Then one night in the summertime , right before I went back to college , just a month or so before they fired him , I bought a six-pack and climbed up here and replayed all the games . Stayed for hours . I could see us out there scoring at will , kicking ass every game . It was wonderful . Then it hurt like hell because it was over , our glory days gone in a flash . " " Did you hate Rake that night ? " " No , I loved him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " For most of us . " " Does it hurt now ? " " Not anymore . After I got married , we bought season tickets , joined the booster club , the usual stuff that everybody else does . Over time , I forgot about being a hero and became just another fan . " " You come to all the games ? " Paul pointed down to the left . " Sure . The bank owns a whole block of seats . " " You need a whole block with your family . " " Mona is very fertile . " " Evidently . How does she look ? " " She looks pregnant . " " I mean , you know , is she in shape ? " " Other words , is she fat ? " " That 's it . " " No , she exercises two hours a day and eats only lettuce . She looks great and she 'll want you over for dinner tonight . " " For lettuce ? " " For whatever you want . Can I call her ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk . " There was no talk for a long time . They watched a pickup truck roll to a stop near the gate . The driver was a heavyset man with faded jeans , a denim cap , a thick beard , and a limp . He walked around the end zone and down the track and as he stepped up to the bleachers he noticed Neely and Curry sitting higher , watching every move he made . He nodded at them , climbed a few rows , then sat and gazed at the field , very still and very alone . " That 's Orley Short , " Paul said , finally putting a name with a face . " Late seventies . " " I remember him , " Neely said . " Slowest linebacker in history . " " And the meanest . All-conference , I think . Played one year at a juco then quit to cut timber for the rest of his life . " " Rake loved the loggers , did n't he ? " " Did n't we all ? Four loggers on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pickup stopped near the first , another hefty gentleman in overalls and denim lumbered his way to the bleachers where he greeted Orley Short and sat beside him . Their meeting did not appear to be planned . " Ca n't place him , " Paul said , struggling to identify the second man and frustrated that he could not . In three and a half decades Rake had coached hundreds of boys from Messina and the county . Most of them had never left . Rake 's players knew each other . They were members of a small fraternity whose membership was forever closed . " You should get back more often , " Paul said when it was time to talk again . " Why ? " " Folks would like to see you . " " Maybe I do n't want to see them . " " Why not ? " " I do n't know . " " You think people here still hold a grudge because you did n't win the Heisman ? " " No . " " They 'll remember you all right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but that was a long time ago . Walk in Renfrow 's Caf and Maggie still has that huge photo of you above the cash register . I go there for breakfast every Thursday and sooner or later two old-timers will start debating who was the greatest Messina quarterback , Neely Crenshaw or Wally Webb . Webb started for four years , won forty-six in a row , never lost , etc. , etc . But Crenshaw played against black kids and the game was faster and tougher . Crenshaw signed with Tech but Webb was too small for the big-time . They 'll argue forever . They still love you , Neely . " " Thanks , but I 'll skip it . " " Whatever . " " It was another life . " " Come on , give it up . Enjoy the memories . " " I ca n't . Rake 's back there . " " Then why are you here ? " " I do n't know . " A telephone buzzed from somewhere deep in Paul 's nice dark suit . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm at the field , with Crenshaw . " A pause . " Yep , he 's here . I swear . Okay . " Paul slapped the phone shut and tucked it into a pocket . " That was Silo , " he said . " I told him you might be coming . " Neely smiled and shook his head at the thought of Silo Mooney . " I have n't seen him since we graduated . " " He did n't graduate , if you recall . " " Oh , yeah . I forgot . " " Had that little problem with the police . Schedule Four controlled substances . His father kicked him out of the house a month before we graduated . " " Now I remember . " " He lived in Rake 's basement for a few weeks , then joined the Army . " " What 's he doing now ? " " Well , let 's say he 's in the midst of a very colorful career . He left the Army with a dishonorable discharge , bounced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got tired of honest work , and came back to Messina where he peddled drugs until he got shot at . " " I assume the bullet missed . " " By an inch , and Silo tried to go straight . I loaned him five thousand dollars to buy the old Franklin 's Shoe Store and he set himself up as an entrepreneur . He cut the prices of his shoes while at the same time doubling his employees wages , and went broke within a year . He sold cemetery lots , then used cars , then mobile homes . I lost track of him for a while . One day he walked into the bank and paid back everything he owed , in cash , said he 'd finally struck gold . " " In Messina ? " " Yep . Somehow he swindled old man Joslin out of his junkyard , east of town . He fixed up a warehouse , and in the front half he runs a legitimate body shop . A cash cow . In the back half he runs a chop shop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " He did n't tell you this . " " No , he did n't mention the chop shop . But I do his banking , and secrets are hard to keep around here . He 's got some deal with a gang of thieves in the Carolinas whereby they ship him stolen trucks . He breaks them down and moves the parts . It 's all cash , and evidently there 's plenty of it . " " The cops ? " " Not yet , but everybody who deals with him is very careful . I expect the FBI to walk in any day with a subpoena , so I 'm ready . " " Sounds just like Silo , " Neely said . " He 's a mess . Drinks heavily , lots of women , throws cash around everywhere . Looks ten years older . " " Why am I not surprised ? Does he still fight ? " " All the time . Be careful what you say about Rake . Nobody center on offense and the noseguard on defense , Silo Mooney owned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just under six feet tall with a physique that resembled , well , a silo : everything was thick -- chest , waist , legs , arms . With Neely and Paul , he started for three years . Unlike the other two , Silo averaged three personal fouls in every game . Once he had four , one in each quarter . Twice he got ejected for kicking opposing linemen in the crotch . He lived for the sight of blood on the poor boy lined up against him . " Got that sumbitch bleedin ' now , " he would growl in the huddle , usually late in the first half . " He wo n't finish the game . " " Go ahead and kill him , " Neely would say , egging on a mad dog . One less defensive lineman made Neely 's job much easier . No Messina player had ever been cursed by Coach Rake with as much frequency and enthusiasm as Silo Mooney . No one had deserved it as much . No one craved the verbal abuse as much as Silo . At the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the county once raised so much hell , an older man moved quietly up to the top row and sat down . He was too far away to be recognized , and he certainly wanted to be alone . He gazed at the field , and was soon lost in his own memories . The first jogger appeared and began plodding counter-clockwise around the track . It was the time of day when the runners and walkers drifted to the field for a few laps . Rake had never allowed such nonsense , but after he was sacked a movement arose to open the track to the people who 'd paid for it . A maintenance man was usually loitering somewhere nearby , watching to make sure no one dared step on the grass of Rake Field . There was no chance of that . " Where 's Floyd ? " Neely asked . " Still in Nashville picking his guitar and writing bad music . Chasing the dream . " " Ontario ? " " He 's here , working at the post office . He and Takita have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as always . They 're in church five times a week . " " So he 's still smiling ? " " Always . " " Denny ? " " Still here , teaches chemistry in that building right over there . Never misses a game . " " Did you take chemistry ? " " I did not . " " Neither did I. I had straight A 's and never cracked a book . " " You did n't have to . You were the all-American . " " And Jesse 's still in jail ? " " Oh yeah , he 'll be there for a long time . " " Where is he ? " " Buford . I see his mother every now and then and I always ask about him . It makes her cry but I ca n't help it . " " Wonder if he knows about Rake ? " Neely said . Paul shrugged and shook his head , and there was another gap in the conversation as they watched an old man struggle in a painful trot along the track . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning more energy talking than walking . " Did you ever learn the true story of why Jesse signed with Miami ? " Neely asked . " Not really . Lots of rumors about money , but Jesse would never say . " " Remember Rake 's reaction ? " " Yeah , he wanted to kill Jesse . I think Rake had made some promises to the recruiter from A &M."; " Rake always wanted to deliver the prizes , " Neely said , with an air of experience . " He wanted me at State . " " That 's where you should 've gone . " " Too late for that . " " Why 'd you sign with Tech ? " " I liked their quarterback Coach . " " No one liked their quarterback Coach . What was the real reason ? " " You really want to know ? " " Yes , after fifteen years , I really want to know . " " Fifty thousand bucks in cash . " " No . " " Yep . State offered forty , A &M; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty . " " You never told me that . " " I never told anyone until now . It 's such a sleazy business . " " You took fifty thousand dollars in cash from Tech ? " Paul asked slowly . " Five hundred one-hundred-dollar bills , stuffed in an unmarked red canvas bag and placed in the trunk of my car one night while I was at the movies with Screamer . Next morning , I committed to Tech . " " Did your parents know ? " " Are you crazy ? My father would 've called the NCAA . " " Why 'd you take it ? " " Every school offered cash , Paul , do n't be nave . It was part of the game . " " I 'm not nave , I 'm just surprised at you . " " Why ? I could 've signed with Tech for nothing , or I could 've taken the money . Fifty thousand bucks to an eighteen-year-old idiot is like winning the lottery . " " But still --  " " Every recruiter offered cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I figured it was just part of the business . " " How 'd you hide the money ? " " Stuffed it here and there . When I got to Tech , I paid cash for a new car . It did n't last long . " " And your parents were n't suspicious ? " " They were , but I was away at college and they could n't keep up with everything . " " You saved none of it ? " " Why save money when you 're on the payroll ? " " What payroll ? " Neely reshifted his weight and gave an indulging smile . " Do n't patronize me , asshole , " Paul said . " Oddly enough most of us did n't play football at the Division One level . " " Remember the Gator Bowl my freshman year ? " " Sure . Everyone here watched it . " " I came off the bench in the second half , threw three touchdowns , ran for a hundred yards , won the game on a last-second pass . A star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country , blah , blah , blah . Well , when I got back to school there was a small package in my P.O. box . Five thousand bucks in cash . The note said : ' Nice game . Keep it up . ' It was anonymous . The message was clear -- keep winning and the money will keep coming . So I was n't interested in saving money . " Silo 's pickup had a custom paint job that was an odd mix between gold and red . The wheels glistened with silver and the windows were pitch black . " There he is , " Paul said as the truck rolled to a stop near the gate . " What kind of truck is that ? " Neely asked . " Stolen I 'm sure . " Silo himself had been customized -- a leather WWII bomber jacket , black denim pants , black boots . He had n't lost weight , had n't gained any either , and still looked like a nose tackle as he walked slowly around the edge of the field . It was the walk of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenge to anyone to utter a careless word . Silo could still put on the pads , snap the ball , and draw blood . Instead he gazed at something in the middle of the field , perhaps it was himself a long time ago , perhaps he heard Rake barking at him . Whatever Silo heard or saw stopped him on the sideline for a moment , then he climbed the steps with his hands stuck deep in the pockets of his jacket . He was breathing hard when he got to Neely . He bearhugged his quarterback and asked him where he 'd been for the past fifteen years . Greetings were exchanged , insults swapped . There was so much ground to cover that neither wanted to begin . They sat three in a row and watched another jogger limp by . Silo was subdued , and when he spoke it was almost in a whisper . " So where are you living these days ? " " The Orlando area , " Neely said . " What kind of work you in ? " " Real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , just one divorce . You ? " " Oh , I 'm sure I got lots of kids , I just do n't know about ' em . Never married . You makin ' money ? " " Getting by . I 'm not on the Forbes list . " " I 'll probably crack it next year , " Silo said . " What kind of business ? " Neely asked , glancing down at Paul . " Automotive parts , " Silo said . " I stopped by Rake 's this afternoon . Miss Lila and the girls are there , along with the grandkids and neighbors . House is full of folks , all sittin ' around , just waitin ' for Rake to die . " " Did you see him ? " Paul asked . " No . He 's somewhere in the back , with a nurse . Miss Lila said he did n't want anybody to see him in his last days . Said he 's just a skeleton . " The image of Eddie Rake lying in a dark bed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . Until the day he was fired he coached in cleats and shorts and never hesitated to demonstrate the proper blocking mechanics or the finer points of a stiff arm . Rake relished physical contact with his players , but not the slap on the back for a job well done . Rake liked to hit , and no practice session was complete until he angrily threw down his clipboard and grabbed someone by the shoulder pads . The bigger the better . In blocking drills , when things were not going to suit him , he would crouch in a perfect three-point stance then fire off the ball and crash into a defensive tackle , one with forty more pounds and the full complement of pads and gear . Every Messina player had seen Rake , on a particularly bad day , throw his body at a running back and take him down with a vicious hit . He loved the violence of football and demanded it from every player . In thirty-four years as head Coach , Rake had struck only two players off the field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ late sixties between the Coach and a hothead who had quit the team and was looking for trouble , of which he found plenty with Rake . The second had been a cheap shot that landed in the face of Neely Crenshaw . It was incomprehensible that he was now a shriveled old man gasping for his last breath . " I was in the Philippines , " Silo said at low volume , but his voice was coarse and carried through the clear air . " I was guardin ' toilets for the officers , hatin ' every minute of it , and I never saw you play in college . " " You did n't miss much , " Neely said . " I heard later that you were great , then you got hurt . " " I had some nice games . " " He was the national player of the week when he was a sophomore , " Paul said . " Threw for six touchdowns against Purdue . " " It was a knee , right ? " Silo asked . " Yes . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out , into the flat , saw an opening , tucked the ball and ran , did n't see a linebacker . " Neely delivered the narrative as if he 'd done it a thousand times and preferred not to do it again . Silo had torn an ACL in spring football and survived it . He knew something about the knee . " Surgery and all that ? " he asked . " Four of them , " Neely said . " Completely ruptured the ligament , busted the kneecap . " " So the helmet got you ? " " The linebacker went for the knee as Neely was stepping out of bounds , " Paul said . " They showed it a dozen times on television . One of the announcers had the guts to call it a cheap shot . It was A &M,; what can I say ? " " Must 've hurt like hell . " " It did . " " He was carried off in an ambulance and they wept in the streets of Messina . " " I 'm sure that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't take much to get this town upset . Rehab did n't work ? " " It was what they sadly refer to as a career-ending injury , " Neely said .

' " " What a waste , " Paul said . " You 'd still be in the NFL . " " Probably with the Packers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chicks bangin ' on my door . The life .

" I need to be heading home soon . " " What about you ? " " A beer would be nice , " Neely said . " You gon na stay here for a while ? " Silo asked . " Maybe . " " Me too .
