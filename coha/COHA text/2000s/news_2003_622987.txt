<p> BUSH IGNORES PROTESTERS ' VOICE ON IRAQ WAR <p> Editor  --  President Bush states that he wo n't be paying attention to anti-war protests around the world because it would be like " decid(ing) policy based upon a focus group . " Interesting , because Bush is running the country by deciding policy based on focus groups : the oil industry , the timber industry , the religious right , etc . The level of hypocrisy in Bush 's statements and actions rises daily , while our confidence and security plummet . <p> DEWEY LIVINGSTON <p> Inverness <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  In trying to dismiss the power of last weekend 's enormous peaceful protests , George W. Bush said he ca n't " decide policy upon a focus group . " I just want to remind him that Vice President Dick Cheney made energy policy based upon a much smaller focus group  --  his energy buddies . So there 's a precedent already set for that sort of thing . Come on , George , you can do it , too ! <p> SUSAN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Editor  --  I would like to remind our president that the democracy he called on Tuesday " a beautiful thing " literally means " the power of the populace " from the Greek " demo " combined with " cracy " meaning , respectively , " populace " and " power or strength . " However , President Bush seems not to be able to connect the ever-elusive dots . <p> He plans to ignore the war protests involving large portions of the populace in favor of his own agenda . And he punctuated with a smirk his " respectful " disagreement with he imagines to be the beliefs of those who disagree with him . So much for the power promised by our Constitution to the populace . I will not pretend to disagree " respectfully " with Dubya . <p> CATHY WASHINGTON <p> Carmichael <p> WHEN PROTEST MATTERED <p> Editor  --  Your Feb. 19 lead editorial asks : " Voices rise ( against war ) , but does it matter ? " <p> Absolutely ! Lyndon B. Johnson  --  who , unlike fellow Texan George W. Bush , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from office four years later because he ignored the will of the people regarding Vietnam . And a very good case can be made that the relentless protests helped to keep the war from becoming worse than it was . So keep it up , America ; we citizens , not our leaders ( legitimate or otherwise ) , are the sovereigns . <p> THOMAS E. BRAUN <p> San Jose <p> PROTESTS IN THE BUFF <p> Editor  --  Recently , the media have given great attention to activists who feel that their nudity is needed to emphasize their peace message ( Open Forum , " Peace buffs , " Sept. 18 ) . The Chronicle printed five such photos of these nude peaceniks , in addition to others in recent weeks . Because most of these activists are female , I wonder if they considered the other message they may be sending their young daughters and granddaughters . If a woman wants to maximize the media 's attention , she should take her clothes off first ? <p> TOM MAC PHEE <p> Santa Rosa <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Feb. 18 ) . All the nudes fit to print , eh ? <p> BOB LACEY <p> Half Moon Bay <p> SEX TOURISTS <p> Editor  --  Americans who travel abroad to have sex with children should be held morally and legally responsible for their actions ( " Ugly Americans : sex tourists , " Feb. 17 ) , but most Americans would be shocked to know their tax dollars actually help to facilitate this practice . <p> While I was in the Navy , I saw the sex-tourist industry first-hand in Olangopo City , the Philippines , and in Phuket , Thailand . Although most of the " tourists " were middle-aged European men , the sailors jumped right into the action . To the best of my knowledge , none of my shipmates ever intentionally sought out children for sex , but many of the girls for sale were teenagers , and a few looked as young as 12 . <p> I often wondered if the Navy stopped in these ports because the sex industry was there , or if the sex-industry was there because the Navy stopped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ports of call on their way to the Persian Gulf , our tax dollars are undoubtedly keeping the sex-tourist industry alive . <p> DAN FAHEY <p> Berkeley <p> CONSUMER PRIVACY <p> Editor  --  Thank you for your recent editorial on SB1 , the privacy bill authored by state Sen. Jackie Speier ( " Why privacy is a priority , " Feb. 18 ) . Your focus on the issue of consumer privacy is very important to ensure a bill that truly protects the consumers . I especially liked your time line and took time to call Assemblyman Joe Nation 's office to remind him to be a pro-active supporter of SB1 rather than to waffle on the subject . <p> Please keep up the good job on keeping the public informed on this important topic . <p> NANCY VALENTE <p> Mill Valley <p> NEWSOM RESPONDS <p> Editor  --  There are some points of fact stemming from your article of Feb. 10 ( " Newsom disclosure flap " ) that I would like to clarify . <p> Your article correctly states that I made a mistake in not reporting two loans on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that error . While these loans were already public documents , they should have also been on my disclosure forms . There was no attempt to hide any transaction , rather a misunderstanding on my part about the need to report the home loans on the disclosure forms . <p> While I now understand why the forms may have created the confusion , the statement in your article , and in subsequent Chronicle reports , that I failed to disclose $9 million in business loans is incorrect . These loans were to a business in which I held a one-half of 1 percent interest and no management position . <p> The city attorney has reviewed these forms , and he is also of the opinion that as a matter of law there was no failure to report the business loans . He stated clearly to me in a letter of Feb. 12 , 2003 that " . . . You are not legally required to report the properties owned by a business of which you own less than 10 percent or the income or loans of that business entity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> GAVIN NEWSOM <p> San Francisco <p> DAVIS RECALL A SHAM <p> Editor  --  All the efforts by some Republicans and anti-tax groups to recall Gov . Gray Davis should be met with serious objection . Not only do these people try to hide their true motives of unseating a democratically elected official , but they are picking the wrong battle . <p> Davis does have many flaws , but our tax dollars should not be wasted in an attempt to unseat an official based on the words of people who are against taxes . As long as people put tax cuts ahead of helping their children , then we will have politicians who will cut funding because raising taxes is politically unfeasible . These people gunning for Davis ' head are the kind of selfish people who would rather drown our government in debt and cut public funding than pay their taxes and help educate the children of the less fortunate . <p> NATHAN DURBIN <p> Oakland <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  To the Republican leadership who just voted to back the recall effort against Gov . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recall 3 1/2 months ago . It was called an election . You lost . Get over it . We do n't need another of your cry-baby distractions right now . We are in a fiscal crisis you helped create . <p> HARTLEY T. HANSEN <p> Sacramento <p>  --   --   --  <p> Editor  --  It is amazing that there are people who are willing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to recall a governor who has done his best to deal with a bad situation he did not create , and yet they are silent about a president who has ruined the national economy , made sure no one paid the price for the fleecing of our state by energy companies and has sent our sons and daughters off to fight in an unnecessary war . How do I start a recall on President Bush ? <p> MARK MASELLI <p> Benicia
