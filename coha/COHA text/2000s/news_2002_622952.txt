<p> San Francisco 's stars must have been aligned just so on the day that Judith Martin , a.k.a . Miss Manners , came to town . <p> Most every resident and visitor knows from personal experience that poor social graces abound downtown . But in a search for bad manners at Union Square , not a one could be found . <p> A skateboarder went by , not whizzing on the sidewalk but with his board tucked politely under his arm . A homeless man in a wheelchair fell silent as she passed and then begged for money from the person behind her . And a limousine driver gave her an appreciative once-over as she stood outside Neiman Marcus , but he refrained from uncouth catcalls in doing so . <p> " Do you want to rent me for the city so that people will behave ? " she asked with a smile . <p> Practically all cities think they have the worst manners . But with society being so mobile and with TV and music acting as pervasive leveling forces , bad manners rub off from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Manners , whose work is syndicated in more than 200 newspapers across the country , including The Chronicle . <p> " There 's very little difference today between one city and another , " she said . <p> Her 15 1/2 million readers know that Martin , 64 , is sharp-witted and wry , but they would probably walk right past her on the street . Clad in a gray pinstripe coatdress , a red and gray floral scarf and with her hair swept into a Gibson girl updo , she could have passed for a businesswoman or a fashionable high-society matron . She was prompt for her interview , sat in ladylike fashion ( legs crossed at the ankles ) and was not prim or stuffy or even grandmotherly but bright-eyed , engaging and friendly , talking with ease and a touch of pride about her path to etiquette fame . <p> The fact that San Francisco 's manners were not particularly egregious was , on this day , a good thing because it freed her up to concentrate on more pressing matters : an engagement at the Commonwealth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Star Spangled Manners : In Which Miss Manners Defends American Etiquette ( for a Change ) " ( Norton , $24.95 ) . <p> Contrary to what the title might imply , the book does not compare the ways that Americans and people from other countries approach social situations . Rather , the book puts forth the historical roots of America 's philosophy on etiquette . <p> It 's a departure from her usual question-and-answer format , and the book takes a quasi-academic tone , with unacademically wry and opinionated touches that are Martin 's hallmark as a columnist . No footnotes , however : Miss Manners would not want readers to be feel as if they were studying for a midterm . <p> Not that Miss Manners would have trouble finding readers for her new book . Here in the Bay Area , she has a loyal following . <p> " She calls a spade a spade , " said Sally Debenham , a Berkeley socialite who has read the column for years . " She couches it in such a way that I 'm not always sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  but she 's an iron fist in a velvet glove . " <p> " Miss Manners is an island on being civil ; Dear Abby is a referee , " said Richard Knapp of Orinda , who sells antiques and ethnic art . " Both are necessary to keep us from killing each other . " <p> So what is there to say in defense of American manners ? <p> Martin 's primary point is that American manners are based on the theory of liberty and equality . <p> Colonialists and the founding fathers set up a system that valued self-expression and the need to respect it . <p> " The job was nothing less than to translate the emerging nation 's ideals into state ritual , ceremony , and through example and precedent if not by fiat , daily behavior . Benjamin Franklin , Thomas Jefferson and George Washington , in particular , were predisposed to become architects of the new etiquette , " she writes . <p> But then , as now , the rules shifted and were sometimes difficult to interpret . As president , Washington observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tardy guests , nor did he refrain from going to sleep at his usual bedtime just because guests wanted to stay . <p> Jefferson favored humble attire and an egalitarian table  --  unpopular because guests of various stations and titles did not know where to sit . <p> It was part of his " Revolution of 1800 , " she writes , a plan to stamp out " any remnants of imperial-appearing etiquette and substituting an entirely republican one . " <p> Later , she notes , " this is surely anti-elitism at its most refined . The idea that no one person should ever be recognized as superior to anyone else  --  that not only should birth and wealth be disregarded as indicators but also ability and achievement  --  keeps surfacing in America , and here was the optimal test of whether it could be made to work . " <p> Immigrants , she continues , have come to the United States in the quest to be treated fairly and the desire to reinvent themselves , something not possible in countries with rigid class systems . <p> She also offers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patterns ( " a regular industry " dreamed up by the Victorians , she says ) , weddings , funerals and the burgeoning cult of celebrity . <p> " The possibility of escaping class designations , ethnic and family affiliations , and personal reputations was immediately obvious , " she writes . " The ability to change and choose our own names became an American right . The ability to choose our work , free of inherited or inescapably contracted conditions , became a matter of free choice after the abolishment of indentured service and slavery . Eventually , we got ambitious and started messing seriously with race and gender , doing away not only with social barriers but with natural ones . Taking advantage of all these possibilities would create an entirely new person . From a successful mix , we get our ' A Star Is Born ' metaphor , which is understood to mean , rather , that a star is created . " <p> How does wanting to be a star relate to manners ? <p> " It 's about our behavior  --  the idea that anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's an amazing thing , though perhaps not as much now as it was 200 or 300 years ago . " <p> Martin , who worked for 25 years for the Washington Post , was one of the first members of the Style section and later worked as a drama and film critic . She took her criticism in another direction when she launched her etiquette column in 1978 . <p> Martin said the best part of her job is reading the mail . She receives letters from 300 readers a week ( more in e-mail format ) , which keep her connected to what 's going on in the country sociologically . <p> Among the bigger changes in American behavior during her time as an etiquette columnist have been shifts toward political correctness . <p> " Twenty-five years ago , nobody batted an eye over what people said in public  --  jokes about African Americans and women , " Martin said . ' In the 1980s , we watched careers self-destruct . As people went on with their banter , other peoples ' eyes opened and they were appalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ egalitarian treatment of women in the workplace . " Men wanted to use their social manners on women in the workplace , so they would say things like , ' You look nice , ' or ask women to get them coffee , " Martin recalled . " Women were afraid to ask for the check during a business lunch or to talk about money because they were using their social manners , too . " <p> Asked whether people actually have become ruder during the past 15 years or if that is just a perception , Martin agrees that society has become uncivil , pointing as the cause to " two generations whose only rearing consisted of being told to assert themselves and not worry about what anyone else thinks . " <p> In answering questions for her column , Martin likens herself to a judge in a courtroom ( when she 's not jokingly referring to her job as " slapping people down " ) . <p> " There 's a contest and everyone knows the law , but how do you apply it to the circumstances , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a question , it 's never bare-bones . It always comes with human material . " <p> " Miss Manners ' column is entertaining and helpful , and much more , " said Michael Dortch , an information technology analyst from San Francisco who wishes her column ran every day instead of once a week . " It is an observant , sharp , trenchant antidote to what passes for ' manners ' today  --  an endemic cluelessness and sense of entitlement in which all too many people today seem all too willing to envelop themselves . <p> " Everybody , whether they know it or not , needs validation of the path we 're stumbling down , especially where other people are concerned . The more clueless the questioner seems to be about what the right thing to do is , the more tactfully she seems to beat them over the head . " <p> Martin 's interest in etiquette stems from her parents . Her mother was a teacher and her father was an economist who occasionally took their family abroad to Colombia , Greece and the Philippines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where in a museum they saw an ancient tablet letter written from father to son . " The letter said , ' Do n't do this , do n't do that , ' " Martin recalled . " We laughed because you really got a good idea of what the kid would have been like . My parents said , ' If you want to know about a society at any point in time , look at their rules . ' " <p> " Star-Spangled Manners , " she said , is a reaction to the idea that Americans are crude . <p> We can take pride in the American idea of behavior  --  that you are entitled to be treated with respect because you are a human being and that you do n't need to be obsequious . " Those were extremely revolutionary ideas , " she said . " Ours is an extremely good system in theory . You ca n't judge an etiquette system by rude people . That 's like saying we need a new legal system because we have criminals . " E-mail Carolyne Zinko at @
