Move over , Martha . As the troubled phone company now known as MCI prepares to emerge from the brink , its erstwhile commander , Bernard Ebbers , may be headed for the pen . Ebbers is the folksy former Mississippi high school basketball coach who hatched WorldCom in 1983 and , through a series of audacious takeovers , built it into the second largest U.S. long-distance operator . But his single-minded pursuit of growth and , in the end , his manic desperation to please Wall Street led him to mastermind , according to his federal criminal indictment last week , an accounting fraud estimated by some experts at $11 billion , the largest in U.S. history . <P> If you 're keeping score at home , that 's about $10,999,955,000 more in financial skulduggery than was involved in Martha Stewart 's trial . ( Stewart saved $45,000 by selling her ImClone shares when she did . ) No one embodies late 1990s speculation more than Ebbers , 62 , who as CEO of a high-flying telecom operated at the epicenter of the tech bubble . Ebbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ options . When WorldCom 's growth machine began to sputter so did its stock price , denting Ebbers ' net wealth . Yet he tapped WorldCom 's cash reserves for hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to buy even more stock plus a huge ranch in British Columbia , a Georgia yacht builder and a minor league hockey team . ( He still owns a golf club and a lumber business in Mississippi . ) To keep WorldCom afloat , prosecutors charge , Ebbers allegedly resorted to a combination of hype , hidden expenses and phantom revenue to inflate earnings by all those billions and perpetuate the illusion that WorldCom was worth its lofty share price . When the hoax finally emerged , the stock went into a slow-motion collapse from 2000 through 2002 , costing investors $180 billion  --  three times the amount of wealth destroyed at Enron . <P> A few hours before Ebbers was indicted , Scott Sullivan , WorldCom 's former chief financial officer and one-time Ebbers crony , pleaded guilty to conspiring with him to conceal WorldCom 's weakening results and submitting false reports to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with prosecutors , will likely be the key witness against Ebbers . According to the indictment , Sullivan urged Ebbers in a September 2000 meeting to issue a warning to investors that revenue was running below expectations  --  a warning that would have hurt the stock price . Ebbers refused , the government charges , and the two men agreed to take steps to inflate profits . <P> The trial will be far more complicated than Stewart 's . For one , jurors will have to parse evidence based on accounting issues that are complex and deadly dull . And there are nagging questions as to why Ebbers , who held almost all his WorldCom stock until the bitter end , did n't dump more shares if he knew the price was propped with bogus financials.
