Thanks to the NBA 's new age minimum , which will require players to be at least 19 and out of high school for a year before being drafted , colleges will harvest a bumper crop of freshmen next season . The surprise is how many first-year players are having an impact this season . Four of the nation 's Top 25 teams start at least two freshmen . Top-ranked Duke 's offense is run by rookie point guard Greg Paulus , who at midweek was dishing out more than five assists per game , many to fellow freshman Josh McRoberts , a forward who was averaging 8.2 points and 4.7 boards . The inside-outside freshman tandem of forward Jon Brockman and point guard Justin Dentmon ( 19.8 points combined ) helped No. 10 Washington get off to an 11-0 start . At No. 25 North Carolina , freshman starters Tyler Hansbrough , Marcus Ginyard and Bobby Frasor , plus reserve Danny Green , had combined for 40.9 points a game . // The team benefiting most from the youth movement is No. 4 Memphis , whose three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the country . Before the Tigers stumbled on Monday against No. 15 Texas , losing 69-58 , they had rolled through one of the toughest preconference schedules in the nation , chalking up 10 wins-including an 83-72 victory over No. 8 Gonzaga on Dec. 27-and just one defeat , to Duke 70-67 . " To be 11-2 against that schedule with all these freshmen and sophomores is amazing , " says Memphis coach John Calipari . " But then , when we started working with them this summer , we realized this team could be really good . " // Though sophomore point guard Darius Washington Jr . ( SI , Oct. 17 ) and hyperathletic senior sixth man Rodney Carney are back from last season 's 22-16 squad , this edition of the Tigers bears little resemblance to that crisis-plagued bunch . Gone are star forward Sean Banks , who scuffled with a teammate last January and was later declared academically ineligible , and guard Jeremy Hunt , who was arrested for an alleged domestic assault and later dismissed for breaking team rules . Calipari is relieved and impressed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year 's group , particularly its five heralded freshmen . Four of them-shooting guard Antonio Anderson and forwards Kareem Cooper , Robert Dozier and Shawne Williams-played together last year at Laurinburg ( N.C. ) Prep , where they were part of what some experts consider the best precollege team in history . // " We all knew what we were capable of , so everyone was in a big rush to get here , " says the 6 ' 9 " , 225-pound Williams , who through Wednesday was averaging 15.4 points and 6.1 rebounds . Williams also had produced untold defensive stops-he held Gonzaga star Adam Morrison scoreless for the final nine minutes of their matchup-and is considered by many to be the best freshman in the nation . Meanwhile , Williams 's classmates and fellow starters , Anderson and guard Chris Douglas-Roberts , were combining for 17.4 points a game . // Williams says the Tigers are especially proud of their defense ( at midweek , they were holding foes to 37.7% shooting ) and their passing ( their 16.3 assists per game ranked second in Conference USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for each other , " he says . " If Rodney hits a three , we want to see him hit another . " // After its brutal early schedule , Memphis should have an easier road in the depleted C-USA , which lost five teams to the Big East and two to the Atlantic 10 . " Our challenge now , " says Calipari , " is to play our best in March . " // Three-Pointer // 1 Michigan State has a rugged opening road in the Big Ten . The gantlet the No. 7 Spartans must run : at No. 6 Illinois , at Wisconsin , home against No. 16 Indiana and at No. 18 Ohio State . Plus , Michigan State faces the conference 's three weakest teams- Penn State , Northwestern and Purdue-only once . Did coach Tom Izzo offend someone in the league office ? // 2 Gerry McNamara needs to regain his range . Syracuse 's senior sharpshooter has been uncharacteristically off the mark , shooting career-low percentages for field goals ( 32.6 ) and three-pointers ( 33.3 ) . // 3 Mike Jensen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " , 250-pound senior forward missed nine games following shoulder surgery , but as his fitness improves , Jensen will provide the Huskies with an experienced big man who can rebound and score . // ?
