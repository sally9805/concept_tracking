What always seems to wreck Africa 's hopes is that so few of its strongmen are really interested in peace . Foday Sankoh and his Revolutionary United Front rampaged across Sierra Leone for nearly a decade , hacking the limbs off countless civilians in a blood-soaked quest for power . Sick of the slaughter , members of the international community brokered a peace pact that last July ultimately gave the rebels amnesty , a share in government power and a piece of the country 's diamond wealth . It apparently was n't enough , so violence has erupted again in poor , shattered Sierra Leone . And this time it has engulfed the very U.N . troops sent to monitor the peace . Soldiers from the unrepentant R.U.F. swooped down on U.N . personnel across the tiny country last week . By Friday , four Kenyan peacekeepers lay dead , more than 300 others were held hostage , and brazen rebels were reportedly " on the move " in 13 captured U.N . armored personnel carriers . <P> The news was bad enough for Sierra Leone . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the U.N . just as it was about to take on a much larger peacekeeping challenge in the Democratic Republic of Congo . U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke , leading a Security Council delegation , secured reluctant agreement last week from Congo 's warring parties to accept peacekeepers . But the spectacle of Secretary-General Kofi Annan scrambling to quell what he called Sankoh 's " flagrant violation " of Sierra Leone 's peace accord raised doubts about U.N . efforts anywhere in Africa . <P> Annan 's immediate priority was to free the hostages in Sierra Leone . Although the Blue Helmets are empowered to use lethal force to protect themselves , they are not there to go to war . Annan begged a host of African leaders to intercede with Sankoh and called for the deployment of a rapid-reaction force to bolster the 8,400 U.N . troops already there . None of the countries capable of sending one were willing ; Britain and the U.S. ruled out their own forces . The mercurial rebel chief variously denied that his men were holding anyone , suggested the U.N . soldiers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U.N . peacekeepers were forcibly and illegally disarming R.U.F. fighters . U.N . officials say they have proof that Sankoh has been sending orders to field units to launch the attacks . " The situation is very fluid and very delicate , " said a U.N . spokeswoman . <P> There is nothing delicate about the R.U.F. At least 50,000 people were killed during the country 's eight years of civil war . Rebels , some as young as 10 , tortured and mutilated an estimated 100,000 more . The peace deal signed by the government and the R.U.F. required Sankoh 's 45,000 men to surrender their weapons in exchange for Cabinet seats in a government of national unity . They have dragged their feet , and now , financed by diamond smuggling , they roam unchallenged . <P> Meanwhile , within weeks of the peace deal 's signing , rebel soldiers from another faction kidnapped 30 U.N . officials , journalists and peacekeepers and more than 200 women and children . All were eventually released , but kidnappings and rapes by various rebel groups and occasional clashes with U.N . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
