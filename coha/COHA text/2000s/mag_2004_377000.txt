Jamie Dimon , the onetime heir apparent at Citigroup before being ousted in 1998 , may yet have the last laugh . Dimon , 48 , first engineered a monumental turnaround at Chicago-based Bank One  --  pushing out top managers , slashing costs by $1.5 billion and helping to turn a $511 million loss in 2000 into a $3.5 billion annual profit three years later . Then he staged a triumphant return to New York City , when Bank One merged with JPMorgan Chase last year . In 2006 Dimon will become the merged firm 's CEO , but he has already begun reshaping the institution in the trademark no-nonsense style he developed while at Citigroup . He has made key personnel changes in the investment-banking and bond areas , brought the bank 's IT management in-house and initiated a risk-management review , while instilling his relentless bottom-line ethic throughout the business . It may take some time for Dimon to deliver the promised $3 billion of annual cost savings from the merger . But by melding his old bank 's retail , credit-card and small-business strengths with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned what some called Citigroup West into a colossus that can give Citi , as Dimon says , " a run for its money .
