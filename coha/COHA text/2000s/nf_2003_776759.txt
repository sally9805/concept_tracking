A Gathering at Faneuil Hall // Ah , Mrs. Howe , you have given us a prose Battle Hymn . // - Frederick Greenhalge , // governor of Massachusetts // The light in New England in late fall is austere and clean and rinses the white steeples of Boston 's Congregational and Unitarian churches , the red brick of the State House , and the gray stone of the Back Bay town houses . Even the gold dome on the white cupola of Faneuil Hall reflects its luster . It 's November 26 , 1894 , the Monday before Thanksgiving , a windy and clear evening , as men and women file into Faneuil Hall from all over Boston and from the suburbs of Cambridge , Watertown , Winchester , and as far out as Quincy and Andover . They have come to this public meeting place near the harbor to talk about the most pressing international human rights issue of the day . // Schooners and sloops and oyster scows make a grid of rigging that glows in the sunset . The sound of squawking gulls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outline of the giant masts of the USS Constitution fading in the twilight of the Charlestown Naval Yard . Across the street the stalls of Quincy Market are closed , the awnings rolled up for the night . // Faneuil Hall was known as the Cradle of Liberty because Samuel Adams and James Otis and the Sons of Liberty had met here in the decade before the American Revolution to form their opposition to the sugar tax , the stamp tax , and other forms of British oppression . The Boston Tea Party was conceived here . The space itself was made even more dramatic when the architect Charles Bulfinch redesigned it in 1805 . Even after government by town meeting ended in Boston in 1822 , the hall continued to be the main forum for political and social debate . Here in the 1840s William Lloyd Garrison , Wendell Phillips , Charles Sumner , and Frederick Douglass gave some of their most important antislavery speeches to overflowing crowds . // By 1873 women were speaking from the podium , and suffragists Lucy Stone and Julia Ward Howe were among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage beneath George A. Healy 's dramatic painting of Daniel Webster exhorting , " Liberty and union , now and forever " on the Senate floor . In keeping with that spirit of reform , a group of prominent New Englanders filled Faneuil Hall on that blustery late-November evening . // All that summer and fall , news of the massacres of the Armenians at the hands of the Turks in the Ottoman Empire reached Americans through news reports and bold headlines in the New York Times , the Washington Post , the Boston Globe , the Chicago Tribune , the San Francisco Chronicle , and in the nation 's leading magazines - The Nation , The Century , and Harper 's . The news came from American missionaries who were teaching Christians at missionary colleges all across the Anatolian plain of central and eastern Turkey ; it came from American and British diplomats stationed in the Armenian provinces of the Ottoman Empire , from European and American journalists , and from Armenian survivors and refugees . And recently it came by way of a new invention - the wireless telegraph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a culture that was just beginning to look outward to the international arena in which the United States would define a global identity in the coming decade . In the first years of the 1890s , there had been a near war with Chile over the killing of two American sailors in Valparaiso , and U.S. involvement in a border dispute between British Guiana and Venezuela that brought jingoism to a new level . Americans such as Theodore Roosevelt began to broadcast their feeling that the country needed a war . The question of annexing the Hawaiian Islands dominated a tug-of-war between the imperialists and anti-imperialists that lasted throughout the decade . // Americans also expressed great sympathy for the Cubans in their struggle for independence from Spain . By 1895 , when Cuban rebels rose up against the deplorable conditions to which they were subjected by their Spanish rulers , the Cuban crisis became a Western Hemisphere liberation cause for Americans . By 1898 the Cuban struggle would lead to the Spanish-American War - the war that consummated the jingoist spirit and launched the United States as a colonial force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a war that lasted ten weeks and gave Cuba its independence , the United States acquired Puerto Rico , the Philippines , and Guam , giving the nation a rising sense of global power . // The 1890s were a transformative time for U.S. foreign policy - a decade in which it would embrace imperialism and assert itself , at times , with a rhetoric of Protestant Anglo-Saxon superiority over the " backward " peoples of the world . The Armenian Question emerged , in some ways uniquely , as a humanitarian project at a time when imperialist designs were governing most American international interventions . // Sultan Abdul Hamid II , the Turkish caliph , had begun to implement his solution to what was now internationally known as the Armenian Question . In short , the Armenian Question revolved around the issue of much-needed reform for the oppressed Armenians - the largest Christian minority living under Ottoman Turkish rule in Anatolia . As the British journalist and longtime resident of Constantinople - Sir Edwin Pears - put it , all the Armenians " desired was security for life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lifetime friend and confidant , the Hungarian scholar Arminius Vambery , wrote , the sultan had decided that the only way to eliminate the Armenian Question was to eliminate the Armenians themselves . The means would be government-sanctioned mass murder on a scale never before seen . // The Turkish massacres of some fifteen thousand Bulgarians in 1876 ( a response to the Bulgarian uprising for independence ) had been an unprecedented act of state-sponsored mass murder that riveted Europe and the United States ... //
