The House <p> When did I first stumble into the wrong grove ? <p> My mother 's house was beautiful . <p> I mean before . We lived on a cul-de-sac called Tinker 's Way , in Bishop , Massachusetts , and behind our house were woods that were wet , or dry , or icy , or soft , depending on the season . I was a small , dreamy , very nervous boy . From the outside , our house looked as if it had been pinched out of clay . The roof tilted . The windows sat uneasily in their frames . The brick walkway to our house curved , sort of unnecessarily . It would have been easier , and a shorter walk for the walkway to have been laid straight . It was missing a brick here and there in a pattern that looked as if a tune was being picked out . At the back of the house , another brick walkway curved in the opposite direction , leading into the woods until it dissolved in leaves and dirt . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing but the ground , at the very end of that walkway . My mother put the gate there ; she trained a vine with blue flowers on it to grow around the gate . One of my earliest memories is of sitting at that gate , staring steadfastly at the woods , where I was not allowed to play alone , with a tremendous sense of anticipation . I was waiting for something or someone to materialize , a monster or a ghost or a wild boar or a band of dirty , magical children who would spirit me away . I was sure that they were coming . I listened hard for them . <p> Inside , the bare wood floors continually rang with the sound of the three of us-my mother ; my older sister , Caroline ; and me-running over them , being kings and queens and tarantulas and creatures from outer space and nameless beings with one or two or three cardboard horns . We spun around the living room , knocking things over . The furniture was draped in different , lush fabrics , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paisleys , brocades , and brilliant colors of velvet . Ghostly muslin at the windows . Shells and important rocks and leaves of particular specialness in the corners of the room . Everything could be moved in an instant for a game or a show or a pageant . My mother flitted between us , her long , loose , wavy red hair like a flag we followed . Both of her parents , my grandparents , had been high school teachers ; she had wanted to be a modern dancer . She had spent some time in Boston after college going on auditions , but it was our house that became her stage . <p> I had a sad brown bear of a father who ran a small contracting business . In Bishop , the contracting work to be had was building additions on the backs of houses , maybe an extra bathroom . I never saw my father in a suit ; there was often dust in his eyebrows . He had a beard like a man from the Civil War ; his jeans sagged . His hands were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when contracting was slow , he 'd go out to the garage where he was teaching himself to make guitars . He stayed there for hours , in silence except for the barely audible , scratchy sound of his transistor radio . We did n't include him in our games , and on the rare occasion when he joined in , he was awkward ; he broke things with his big hands . He could n't thread a needle , could n't manage yarn , could n't glue . Eggshells were a catastrophe for him . He brought me a football , a set of little green soldiers , a magnifying glass . I put them all on my bookshelf and left them there . I did , though , like the shape of the magnifying glass , and the way it made the book spines behind it look strange and dreamy if you propped it on its side . <p> I did n't like war or footballs or magnifying glasses or the half-built additions he took me in the drafty truck to see . I liked to make beautiful things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mother would fill the sink with ice and then , together , we 'd pour food coloring onto the ice , and the blue and red and yellow would swirl , making purple and green in some places , while in other places the blue or the red tendriled down on its own , cutting a long blue path , a river or a ribbon , over the frozen hummocks heaped up in our ordinary sink . I thought it was a miracle . It seemed that she did , too , leaning on her elbows on the counter . We could do that for hours , not getting hungry or tired , staring at the treasure in the kitchen sink , pouring in the red , pouring in the blue . " Gabriel , " she said , " be a maestro , " and I was a maestro with my bottles of food coloring , conducting our symphony in the kitchen sink . <p> Gabriel , my mother used to say . My angel . When she said it , I really thought it was true . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . In Massachusetts , Caroline was always outside , running around the yard finding things or digging holes for archaeological digs or , later , making up songs on the back porch with those two weird guys , the two Davids-we never knew which one was her boyfriend , and they looked just the same , anyway . My mother and I would be inside making things , or using little paintbrushes to paint the things we had made . She could make four dots of paint look exactly like a dog , or a dragonfly , or a bunch of grapes . I was desperate to know how she did that . I gripped my little paintbrush in my sweaty hand , trying to make my dots look like hers . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
