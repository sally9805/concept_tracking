Nearly 200 of you responded with all sorts of tales ( more than a few of them unprintable ) . We learned about incredible acts of marksmanship , deer that " sure looked dead , " encounters with unhappy and surprisingly agile cattle , general early-morning confusion ( eggs fried in Ajax cleanser was one of the more interesting foul-ups ) , and a wild collection of practical jokes . The stories listed here are our favorites . Some may be hard to believe , but if you 've ever gone to deer camp , you know that they 're true . Medium Rare , Please By Jack Vroble ( AMITY , PENNSYLVANIA ) My Buddy , Marty , has a deer camp in Pennsylvania . He also owns and runs a successful restaurant .

As he was making lunch , he looked out the window and saw a deer go over a rise just a short distance from the cabin . He stopped what he was doing , grabbed his rifle , and went after the deer , dropping it just below the rise . While he was dressing it out , a hunter he did n't know came by and said , " Do n't move ! I 'll be back ! " A few minutes later the hunter returned with a few friends . " See ? " he said to them . " I told you this guy came prepared ! " Marty looked down and noticed he was still wearing his chef 's hat and apron . And He 's Been Eating Acorns By Tony Garcia ( LAKE FOREST , CALIFORNIA ) When I took herb on his first deer hunt , I just had to set him up . It 's an old trick , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and his son Brian ( who was in on the joke ) , I pulled my truck to the side of the road , explaining that I had spotted some deer tracks in the snow . I quickly jumped out of the truck with pockets full of chocolate-covered raisins and piled them in the snow , out of Herb 's sight . Kneeling down , I called for Brian . He and Herb walked over . I pointed to the pile of raisins , " explaining " that they were fresh deer droppings . Then I reached down , grabbed a few raisins , and popped them in my mouth . " It 's a buck , heading east , " I declared . Brian then reached down and ate a few of the raisins , too . " A 3-pointer , " he said . " Gross ! " said Herb . He ran off , groaning and nauseated , as Brian and I howled with laughter in the snow . I Guess I Win By James Haugen ( ELY , MINNESOTA ) In-between is a game where players are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ card turned up will be in between the first two . Six of us were playing at the hunting shack one evening , and during the game several players had been dealt good cards and had bet the pot . But they lost , and the pot had doubled and redoubled several times . With the pot holding a couple hundred dollars , I was dealt an ace ( a low card ) and a king . I bet the pot . The next card up was an ace . I hit the post next to me in disbelief . The post held the main beam , from which the gaslights were hanging . The vibrations broke both mantles and knocked them over . The shack went pitch-black . Afterward , all the players claimed that they were making sure the money did n't get lost in the confusion , but at the moment the lights went out , six pairs of hands met in the middle of the table on top of the pot . Using Your Head By Dennis Shrontz ( WYOMING , MICHIGAN ) It was my son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come up to deer camp with me since he was 12 , but now he was 14 and ready to hunt . The first morning out Steve had a little mishap that he shared with us all that night at the supper table . He had sat against a double-trunked birch tree with his head against the vee , and it was n't long before he fell asleep . It was windy that day , and at one point the wind had moved the trunks apart just enough for Steve 's head to slip down between them and get stuck when the wind eased up . I guess that woke him up ! He flopped around like a fish until the wind blew again , moving the trunks apart , and he could get his head out . As the laughter finally died down and Steve looked around the table at all of us , I think he realized that his biggest mistake was n't getting his head caught in a tree , but letting us all know about it . He 's 25 now and has to live this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Robert L. Baumbach ( CENTER , MISSOURI ) Harold worked for the railroad and was n't much of an outdoorsman . I coaxed him into joining my friends and me at deer camp one year . Harold planned to arrive early on opening day , find a place to hunt until evening , and then join us in camp . Opening day was cold and rainy , and the veterans in camp were n't surprised when Harold never showed . Back at home , we were anxious to hear Harold 's excuse . Turned out he had overslept opening day . It was 10 A.M. when he drove past a DEER CROSSING sign on public land , not far from our camp . He could think of no better place to watch for a buck , so he parked his truck and walked into the woods by the sign . After a 15-minute wait , an 8-pointer walked by and Harold dropped him with one shot . He drove home with his trophy , wondering where the challenge was in deer hunting : The government put up signs telling you where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BEACH , MARYLAND ) My brother Rog and I hunt a farm on the Western Shore of the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland . It has a marsh that 's bordered with long fingers of land jutting down into the water , leaving deep gullies on either side . If a hit deer goes into a gully , it takes two hunters with about 300 feet of rope and a four-wheel-drive vehicle to get the deer out . One day Rog decided to hunt the edge of the marsh at the bottom of one of these fingers . A large doe eventually gave him a good broadside shot , and of course , it chose the gully on the marsh side to go down when hit , ending up about 25 yards in . With no good idea on how to get the deer out , I got Lucky , my black Lab , and commanded him to get the " duck . " He looked confused , but he went into the marsh and swam to the deer . Lucky started mouthing it , and he and the deer started rolling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ear ! " I yelled . While I do n't think he understood the command , Lucky grabbed the doe 's ear and dragged this " duck " to shore  --  all 125 pounds of it  --  like he 'd done it a hundred times . He dropped the doe on the ground and sat right next to it , looking as proud as ever . Next Time , Cover Your Tracks By Robert L. Baumbach ( CENTER , MISSOURI ) In 1968 I joined a group of seven men who 'd been hunting together for years . Our hike-in camp was primitive , with tents set up in the middle of Mark Twain National Forest , 4 miles off a gravel road . We were far enough off the traveled roads that we were completely undisturbed by any outsiders . At least we thought so , until one of the guys , Dan , was called out of his tent one rainy morning and served with divorce papers . That woman must have gone to a lot of trouble to get someone to track Dan down and serve him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeper into the woods  --  and we made sure we did n't tell anyone .
