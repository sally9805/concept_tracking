The summer after Nixon resigned , my father began selling the Mr. America Body Sculpting kits , carrying them in the trunk of his Chevy Impala and wholesaling them door to door . August was the wrong time for such work , walking our low North Carolina hills in his brown suit , lugging the boxes of weights , stepping along broken sidewalks and driveways into basements and attics where he would assemble the kits for his customers and drink the glasses of iced tea they offered him . For all of his forty-one years , he 'd had an unerring knack for predicting trends after they 'd already occurred , conceiving hotshot ideas and then failing to capitalize on them , a natural inclination to wrong turns . At a time when it seemed everyone in the country had discovered jogging and yoga , the whole idea of lifting weightsgrunting , sweating , pumping ironseemed almost right-wing , as out of fashion as the Mr. America ads I saw in the back of my Popular Mechanics . They were always the same , those crudely drawn comic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heading toward the beach , where the crew-cut guys would fight over girls in Annette Funicello hairdos and two-piece swimsuits too modest to be called bikinis . Even I understood the irony of those ads in that time , and I did n't know anything . I was sixteen years old , growing up in a city of subdivisions with names like Green Valley and Forest Glen , near a shopping center where each Christmas Santa Claus would drop in on a parachute . I let myself be carried through days by what amounted to a dumb acceptance of life , like a cow in afield . I wore a ponytail then , not as any kind of statement , but because my mother , Gladys ( who insisted I call her by her first name ) , fancied herself an artist and poet and thought that raising a nonconformist child made her seem more the part . Her poems were published in mail-order anthologies she had to agree to buy for $29.95 , an extra $10 for her name embossed in gold on the cover , her poems scattered in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subjects of Grandpa 's farm , old dying dogs , and the American flag . One year she won the " Platinum Poetess Medal " and flew her first jet flight to Chicago , paid $275 ( plus air fare and accommodations ) , and walked onto a plywood riser in the Airport Ramada to receive a framed certificate and a fountain pen . She went along with all this , I think , pretending , knowing that her poems were not very good , but wanting the pleasure of them anyway . Gladys believed that her final reward abided in me , that after nine and a half months of pregnancy and thirty-one hours of labor and a couple decades of free-spirited well-meaning parenting , I would finally become a " serious artist of some importance . " This was her phrase , and she repeated it as though I 'd come with a warranty . But the closest I came to an artistic impulse was dancing on my mattress in my underwear , whanging away at an imaginary guitar while Grand Funk or Led Zeppelin howled on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bong hits or tabs of acid , no one drank beer and drove around at night throwing the empties at stop signs . Instead they drove to the beach in paneled woodies filled with surfboards , enduring an endless summer . They had never seen leftover spray-painted microbuses and tiny Japanese cars , had never been stuck in a gas line on some cold Monday morning . Everybody in Mr. America world was white ; no one had long hair , no one was poor . It was a world , stuck there in glossy black and white , into which my father would have fit nicely ; people had not yet learned to give up their trust of politicians , policemen , salesmen . He could have made a killing selling embossed Bibles or hair tonic or fallout shelters . The world would not change so much , so quickly . He finally caught on , that summer of 1975 , too late , when the sixties were finally over and he began wholesaling surplus army clothes and neon tie-dyed T-shirts , the same year everybody began blow-drying their hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever . I did n't know how to tell him . But my father could sell . I needed no more evidence of this than the fact that he 'd sold Gladys on the idea of marrying him , even though her family cut her off from the money they 'd made selling Standish 's Lawn Builder and other fertilizer supplies , kicked her off the property at Pawleys Island one October . But for my father , nothingnot even winning Gladyswas ever enough . He grew impatient in his selling , made mistakes , got fired . He went through so many jobs that finally he had printed up a generic business card : Roman Morrill Strickland Salesman In the corner was a fancy four-color graphic of a cherub adorned with hearts , garlands , and bows . My father said he intended the cherub to symbolize him , to be something that would stick in the minds of his customers , an idea he dredged from one of the motivational and super-salesmanship books he constantly read . I did n't tell him that at a stocky five foot ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid gut hanging over his belt , and dense fur covering his chest , he was hard to imagine as anything remotely cherubic . Roman was handsome , in a way that had gone out of stylehis wide-shouldered burliness , gold tooth in the corner of his mouth , suspenders beneath his suitcoats . He wore a pinkie ring and paid money he could not afford for manicures . During up years he drove a big Lincoln Continental with suicide doors and opera lights . He still believed suaveness and manners carried currency with women , and , for a certain portion of his life , it did . The weight sets were n't moving . Roman had assembled one of them in the damp basement of our house , beneath the pink lightbulb my mother kept screwed in the overhead socket because she liked the light it threw on her sheets when she folded laundry . She believed in small pleasures . At night after supper my father went downstairs and lifted weights , wearing a T-shirt , his pants tucked into a pair of old leather lace-up wrestling shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of barbells and free weights which were no more than disks of cement wrapped in maroon plastic . There was also a bench that would tilt and recline for preacher curls and bench presses , a jump rope with weighted handles , a medicine ball , hand grips , a leather belt , and a full-size drawing of a man with his major muscle groups colored in pinks and browns and labeled with Latin names . This my father taped to the water heater , so I had to walk under the stairs to see the major muscle groups of the man 's left shoulder and arm . Every evening I followed my father to the basement and read aloud the instructions for doing the exercises properly , to achieve , the booklet said , " the full Mr. America ISOTONIC(tm) Benefit ! ! ! " Roman grunted with each lift , and beneath the pink bulb the redness of his face deepened . There seemed to be some kind of disappointment built into the set , as if making yourself anything like the pictures of Mr. America on the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balls ) was simply impossible . I could not imagine Roman ever looking like that . Plus , the sound of the weights was n't right ; instead of the clang and ring of iron , the plastic-covered free weights gave forth a quiet pock when they hit into one another . Within a week the bar had begun to rust and the cement had broken inside several of the weights , so that they rattled like a box of stones . Roman wore a faint stripe of oil across his T-shirt where the bar rested on bench presses . My job was to spot for him , and the first night he 'd assigned it to me , he sat me down on the bench , looked me in the face , and wrinkled his eyes with deep concern ( his " closing face , " he called it ) . He told me he was putting his life in my hands . He took my wrists and held up my hands for me to see . I felt like some crack demolition expert , a gifted heart surgeon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those 210 pounds squarely on his windpipe , there would be nothing I could do except run to the phone or scream . But when the reps slowed , I acted as if I were helping him , as if I really could save his life . He paid me two dollars an hour . One night I stood behind him watching the bar rise and fall , bobbing my head to the sound of Deep Purple playing on the portable eight-track plugged in above the workbench . Roman puffed and grunted , smoking Pall Malls between sets , a thin film of sweat coating the vinyl bench of the weight set . Ours was not a normal basement with stacks of runny paint cans , tools , sawdust , and broken toys . Instead we were surrounded by leftover samples of all the things my father had sold , from jobs he 'd held and lost . One shelf contained boxes of an all-in-one kitchen appliance called the Juice Moose , which actually worked , but came with a pink-and-blue cartoon moose permanently embossed on the front . Below that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polystyrene golf balls guaranteed to shave five strokes off your game . Gladys stood beside us snapping sheets under her pink bulb , folding my father 's boxer shorts and starching his collars while she ironed on top of the washer , turning inside out my rock-band T-shirts so the iron-on decals would n't melt . She tried to hide under the basket of clothes her own underwear , the black front-hook bras and lace garter belts . It was only lately that I had connected the contents of the laundry with what my mother must have been wearing under her clothes , under the tan khaki skirts and tennis shorts and Peter Pan collars ; it did n't seem to fit , as if there had been some mix-up and the washing machine had transported away what I imagined to be my mother 's real underwear : white , wiry bras with wide straps andGod knows , I really thought thisbloomers . The black and silvery lace she tucked beneath the pile of clothes seemed like some other life she was hiding away . While I watched her , Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settle the bar while the tape deck clicked onto " Space Truckin ' . " I plucked the pocket of my jeans with an imaginary guitar pick . " Turn that crap down , " Roman said . " They sound like a bunch of maniacs . " " The very thing your father said about Buddy Rich , " Gladys said . " Gabe 's absorbing the music of his culture . It 's part of his education . " " Study the way money works , son . That 's all you need to know . " " Really , Roman , " Gladys said . " Gabe , ignore him . " " I 'm serious , " Roman said . " One of your teachers starts poppin ' off about ... " He shrugged and stubbed out his Pall Mall on the leg of the weight bench . He swung his legs across and sat up . " What are they poppin ' off about these days ? " " The Bastille ... " I said . " Robert Frost ... cosines . " " Okay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frost , you raise your handalways polite , customers remember thatyou raise it and say , How will this help me make money ? ' No answer ? Walk out . " He took a towel out of the fresh laundry and wiped his neck . " Do n't you listen to him , Gabe , " Gladys said . " Think what money did to Richard Burton and Ernest Hemingway . " " God , yes , " Roman said . " They had to get paid to be on TV , marry gorgeous women , drive sports cars . It was awful . " " I ca n't walk out of school , Dad , " I said . " I 'll get busted . " " Then I 'll teach you , " Roman said . " Home schooling , right here . Lesson one . You knock on a door , lady in curlers , face like a gravel driveway , and you 're there to sell her what ? " I looked at my mother , and she rolled her eyes . This was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Fine , good , " Roman said . " But you know by looking she 's a tough sell . Ask for a few minutes of her time , offer a free gift , blah blah blah , she asks if you want to talk on the porch or come inside . What do you say ? " I shrugged . " Go inside ? " Roman smiled at me , his gold tooth showing . Then he raised up his arms and started gyrating , circling his hands , twisting side to side from the waist like some Egyptian snake dancer . " Oh that 's up to you ma'am . I 'm completely flexible . " He stopped his dance . " You get it ? The slightest giggle from that woman , the least baby smile , and bammoney in your pocket . " I laughed . " Wonderful , Roman , " my mother said , shaking out a pillowcase . He ignored her . " There might be a quiz over this material , " he said . Gladys shook her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Gabe , look at me . Promise me you wo n't go chasing after money . This is important to me . " " Okay , " I said , and shrugged . I was sixteen and life held little weight . I could promise anything to anybody . Roman picked up the spring-loaded hand grips and began squeezing them . His arms had expanded in the three weeks he 'd been lifting , but without the definition of muscle , like Mr. America on the box . They grew instead like loaves of bread , thick and doughy , his chest barreling outward . He was quickly approaching being able to press his weight . " All right , son , here comes math and philosophy at one crack . Just suppose I told you I only sold one Mr. America kit in the last two weeks . Sixty bucks commish take away gas and oil with the trunk loaded down leaves about twenty bucks , half a month 's work , divided fifty hours a week . Then suppose I said this meant the light bill would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and no food . Then you think you could say that money is important ? " My mother dropped her skirt on the floor . " Roman , not again . Please not again . " Unpaid bills were usually the topic of the muffled arguments I heard through their bedroom wall . He waved his hand , the grips jingling . " Purely hypothetical . What do you say , son ? " As I started to answer , Gladys picked up the flowered skirt , crushed it into a ball , and threw it across the basement against the underside of the stairs . It dangled there , caught on a splinter . In two strides she made it across the room and punched Roman hard in the shoulder . " Goddamn it , Roman . You stop this . I want you to tell me . " He looked at her and rubbed his shoulder . " Everything 's taken care of , Gladys . Do n't worry . " I understood enough of their marital code to know that this meant trouble , that my mother would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ice cream warehouse at United Dairy . I knew that they would have a yard sale and I 'd be forced to pitch in something , old roller skates or eight-tracks I did n't listen to anymore . On top of all that , I knew that Roman had an amazing aptitude for losing jobs and that Gladys hated it more every time it happened . Among the other leftovers on our basement shelves we had a dozen dust-covered green lawn chairs woven with a product called Supra-Webbing . Roman had done well one summer selling them on a commission-only deal for the inventor , who , to prove his product , had tied a length of the webbing to the bumper of his truck and pulled down a rotted fifty-foot silo on his farm near Asheboro . Going door to door , Roman carried with him color photos of the silo crashing in the gravel lot , and sold fourteen boxes of chairs his first week out . The second week he took me with him , to drive him around ( I was fourteen at the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Care Facility . This had been Roman 's brainstorm , to sell chairs and webbing replacement service contracts to every retirement village and nursing home in the state , places , he said , where everyone had nothing to do all day but sit . He liked his idea so much that he called Paulie Mathers , the Lincoln dealer , and put in an order for a new baby-blue Continental with electric windows , pecan trim , leatherette seats , and whitewalls . The manager of Bermuda Run was a middle-aged , overweight woman in a green flowered housedress with Kool 100s sticking out of the pocket . As Roman worked his way through his pitch , she examined the lawn chairs , blowing smoke through her nostrils , and said in her tiny voice that they looked " flimsy . " My father handed her the pictures again . " Look at that silo , Margaret . Flimsy ? Time and the weather ca n't knock the damn thing down . Pardon my French . No problem for Supra-Webbing . After we did this experiment we made chairs from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are the very chairs I use in my home today . " She picked up one of the chairs and shook it , her other hand holding the photos and her cigarette . " I do n't know . You think they would hold me ? " Roman looked furtively around the room . " Margaret , I 'm not supposed to divulge this , but NASA has contacted us about Supra-Webbing , for moon landings , space module parachutes , top secret programs , that sort of thing . This was the first lawn chair on the moon . " She studied the photos of the downed silo . " Do you think that 's real , or they staged it ? " " The pictures do n't lie . The silo was estimated to weigh three tons . " " No , I mean that whole man on the moon thing . Some people say it was a movie set . " Roman hesitated . " I ca n't say I 've thought about it . " " ' Cause if it was a movie I had no business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get up at that hour for Tyrone Power . " Roman bit his lip and glanced at me . He 'd been thrown off his rhythm , as important to him in his pitch as to a major leaguer hurling a fastball . " Margaret , these chairs are so comfortable that in my very own home we 've given away the couch . Gave it away to charity . They 're what we , my family and I , personally sit in . " He lowered his voice . " Look at my son over there . " This was the solemn part of the sell , where Roman could somehow link lawn chairs ( or electric can openers or aluminum siding ) to the health and potential of America 's youth . Margaret looked at me and smiled , blowing smoke through her nose . " You think I 'd trust his safety and comfort to any lawn chair ? " Roman asked . She laughed at him . Laughed out loud , her mouth exploding in smoke and noise , laughed without a joke . Everyone who got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front-porch stories Roman told , at the audacity of the pitch , at their own willingness to be carried along . According to Roman , after people bought something , they loved the person who had sold it to them . But Margaret , this woman in the flowered housedress , had stepped outside all that , forgotten her function as customer , blown her unwritten lines . My father called this " breaking the bubble . " Roman 's face reddened . " Ben Franklin was a very wise man , I think you 'll agree , Margaret . " I nearly laughed at him myself . The Ben Franklin close was a last resort , an amateur 's way out , a spitball . Even I knew she was nowhere near closing . Roman pressed on . " Ben Franklin , faced with a tough decision , would do a typically wise thing , Margaret . He 'd sit and make a list of all the positives and all the negatives , then see which outweighed the other and go with that . " He drew pen and paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you like the color of the chairs . That 's a positive . " He wrote it down . " Number two , you like the superior strength . " She frowned . " I never said that , Mr. Strickland . " He ignored her . " Number three ... " Margaret looked at me . " You know he fathered thirteen illegitimate children ? Read it in the World Examiner . " I froze , convinced for a moment she was talking about Roman . " I do n't call that very wise , " she said to Roman . He began to put away his photos and samples , cramming them into his bag , winding the Supra-Webbing samples into tight rolls . " You call if you change your mind , " he said . She shook her head . " I just do n't think they 'd hold me , " she said , as if her decision had hinged on this point . It was the moment we should have walked out , but Roman , as ever , had to have the last word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " The question is , why in hell would they want to ? I mean , I sure as hell would n't want to hold you . I 'm sure your husband does n't . " " Dad , " I said . He looked at me . " Can you think of anyone , Gabe ? So maybe you 're right , Margaret . Why should we pick on these poor chairs ? " In the parking lot he stopped and stood by his car , just staring off . " You should n't have said that , " I told him . " You blew it . " " I know it , Gabe . I know it . " He scratched his head . " If they would just be quiet and listen , then I could tell them what they need , they could buy it , we 'd all be happy . " " But they do n't have to listen . You always forget that . " " No , you 're right , son . We 're living in a fallen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He smiled at me , then walked back inside , apologized , and gave Margaret one of the sample Supra-Webbing chairs . But it was too late for apologies . The next morning she had called and complained to his boss , and before lunchtime that day he 'd been fired and had canceled his order for the Lincoln . For Roman , another routine week . Gladys hit him with her fist again , softer this time . " I mean it , Roman . If you do this to us again , something 's going to change . " She shook her head . " I ca n't live this way . " " Mom , he said everything 's under control . " " You 're smarter than that , Gabe . You 've lived here sixteen years . " She looked at my father , who had the towel draped like a turban over his head . " tell me , right now , " she said . " If you keep disturbing the class , " Roman said , " I 'll have to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salesman 's sense of timing , where a bad joke could break the ice , where pushing too hard could force the deal , where walking away was always possible . None of this worked at home , with her . My mother stared at him , not wanting to let him off this time , wanting , I could tell , some real threat behind her words . She wanted to be able to dock his pay , to assign him a shit territory , to fire himsomething he could understand . Instead she turned and stomped up the stairs above us , leaving her iron smoldering on the washer , burning through my father 's bowling pin tie . " So what 's your answer , son ? " I stepped and lifted the iron , shut it off . " I guess the money 's pretty important , " I said . He smiled and opened his hands to flex the muscles in his forearms , the odor of burned polyester all around us . " Class dismissed . " Roman gave up the Mr. America kits after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and went back to household products . He hated household products because they were always steady sellers . You would never lose money , he saidhousewives always needed oven cleaner and vegetable brushesbut by the same token you could never make money either . Not real money . In Georgia during the early sixties , he had a job selling Bibles door to door to the wives of cotton farmers and factory workers . He hit on a town called Byleah the morning after the Reverend Bobby Mortimer had blazed through with his tent revival , one long night of hellfire , healed goiters , and dyslexic schoolchildren cured of their demons . So after three and a half weeks of break-even , Roman pulled into town with his trunkload of gold-embossed red-letter Bibles and sold out in just over two days . He ordered more , loaded his car from the front seats back , got his hands on Bobby Mortimer 's schedule , and followed that tent revival twelve hundred miles across the South , sweeping in behind like he was God-sent , selling Bibles without opening his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half a year . But nothing like that was possible with household products . " No matter how you look at foaming bathroom spray , " he said to me once , " God 's just not in it . " And no challenge in pushing the products either ; women were either out of cleaners or toothbrushes or they were n't , and he could please come back in a month . " Take something like space-age lawn chairs , Gabe , " he said to me , " or a framed copy of the Declaration of Independence . " He shook his head . " There , you create a need , make it out of nothing , where it never existed before you opened your mouth . " He believed in the sale , lived his life in dedication to it . Once , to prove a point to Gladys , he bought up six cases of Thin Mint Girl Scout cookies , then went around the neighborhood in his shirtsleeves , hat tipped back , and in three hours sold all six cases for double price . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows what he told the people who bought them . So he came back to household products the way you come back to bad love . He sold them only because it appeased my mother , who seemed to like the idea of paying bills on time . Within a few weeks she 'd managed to stock the freezer with hamburger and to get our couch and console stereo back from the repossessors . She was happy during that time , happy that she 'd avoided part-time work at United Dairy , happy that my father was assigned local territory , that the paychecks were regular . This stirred Roman 's belief that it was the money making her happy , instead of just the steadiness . He believed too that more money meant more happiness . This was his way of thinking : if he had a headache , he swallowed four aspirin , thinking this would cut his recovery time in half . Household products offered stability , so there had to be a way to squeeze even more stability out of them , if only , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shake things up . Roman began his next set of twenty reps , speaking in grunts and expelled breaths . " It 's a matter of pushing harder , " he said . I was spotting for him and reading aloud from Winning As a Way of Life , which had arrived two days before with my mother 's book club selection , and which he 'd already underlined and dog-eared . The book consisted of easy-to-remember rhyming homilies on the subjects of selling , winning , and making money ( " If you want to earn your dough , get up in the morning and GO , GO , GO ! " ) . Gladys was upstairs somewhere , working on a poem based on Billy Graham 's new book , Angels : God 's Secret Agents , which had been her monthly book club selection . " But you told me demand was a constant , " I said . " Either you have stuff to clean your oven or you do n't . " He grunted , dropping the bar on its rests . " Read that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we might use emotion , devotion , or some secret potion , nothing does more than old-fashioned promotion . ' " I looked down at him . " See my point ? It 's all advertising , Gabe . Just look at your Uncle Dutch . Son of a bitch could n't sell shit to a green fly , but look at the business he does . " Uncle Dutch was older than Roman by six years . He owned a Ford and Plymouth dealership on the outskirts of Kernersville where he had five acres of new cars and an OK Used Car lot . Ads for his dealership ran on late-night TV during Twilight Theater , for which he was the sponsor . Gladys was the only one who still got excited when his new ads ran . The commercials always featured Dutch doing things like jumping out of an airplane dressed as a turkey , or sitting atop one of his billboards on the highway , wearing a tuxedo and eating dinner by candlelight . In the latest ad , one of his Plymouth Furys had been immersed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheel wearing scuba equipment , waving at the camera . The joke of every ad was that Dutch never smiled , played everything with a serious deadpan , as if all these things had been done to him and he was the hapless victim of some prank . In truth , Dutch was as serious as he seemed ; he had no discernible sense of humor . The stunts were designed by his advertising agency and he went along only because they sold cars and put money in his accounts . He was as rich as Roman wanted to be . Everywhere across three counties were the billboards of Dutch 's solemn face , his black hair and silver sideburns , white suitcoats and brown ties . When I was a little kid he would come to our house for a visit once a year at Christmas , but at age forty-three he had married Miss North Carolina , and afterward the two of them spent Christmas in Las Vegas . Three years later Miss North Carolina divorced him , and for a year after that Roman worked for him selling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his conscience to sell a Plymouth to anyone . The real reason , I knew , was that he did n't like having to work for his brother . ( Continues ... )
