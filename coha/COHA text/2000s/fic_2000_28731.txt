My hands are calm . I put in , take out , take my time . I 'm standing inside my closet , filling my honeymoon suitcase . Three o'clock in the morning . I ca n't sleep . Sunglasses . Hat . Lingerie . Bathing suit , jeans , sneakers . Outside my bedroom window , light swallows darkness until , gradually , morning will come , my wedding day . I start humming a Dylan song , " Visions of Johanna , " our song , Scottie's-my fianc's-and mine , and fold a nightgown my mother might have bought me if she were here , for my trousseau . I slip into one of my mother 's favorite songs , " All Shook Up , " picking up the pace a little , the Elvis rhythm . Tuck the sunscreen and my sketchbook in the corner of my suitcase until suddenly I 'm bent over , unable to move as my mind races back , remembering . *** " You were named for Elvis , " my mother says calmly , as if she 's telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ juice . Theo 's not born yet , so I must be four , almost five . It is my first real memory , and we are in the kitchen in our small house in Michigan . It is 1966 . When my father is out of town , we spend a lot of time in the kitchen , at the round Formica table-me with my coloring book , my mother heating leftovers . She cuts corners when he 's away . And she sews . The tiny square of brown linoleum floor becomes a place where outfits get made and tales get spun . Alone with me , my mother can transform herself from an ordinary wife and mother into someone capable of greatness . I look up from the house I 'm coloring without saying a word . And so she lowers her sewing and repeats , in her pretty southern accent , " Darlin ' , did you hear me ? You were named for Elvis Presley . Not even your father knows that . Would n't you like to share a secret , just you and me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret before , and I 'm flattered and shy and resistant all at once , as if she is taking me somewhere I 'm not sure I want to go . " But my name is Silvie , not Elvis ! " I say , thrusting out my lip , looking at her . When I was older , I thought my mother had a stern and noisy beauty , a high forehead and long , oval face that , to me , suggested the nobility she longed for . Her large nose had a bump that only made her more beautiful , along with the thick straight hair the color of warm toast and the lips red with lipstick . But on this day in the kitchen , she frightens me-there is too much to see in her face , and I look down at the house I 'm coloring , purse my lips , let my fingers graze over the shiny points of my new box of sixty-four Crayola crayons . " Silvie backwards spells Elvis , " my mother says . " Roughly speaking , of course . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get too carried away . " She laughs brightly . I feel somehow ashamed . I thought I had my own name . " It 's an anagram , " my mother says , and I hold my sky-blue crayon tightly ; I 've been coloring the sky above the house and I do n't want to stop . All my pictures are the same : a burnt-sienna house with a chimney , a green tree , green grass with a red tulip , and sky , sky , sky , all around and above . I love the sky , because it takes a long time to color , although , really , it 's nothing , just color layered upon color . " An anagram is letters all scrambled up that make different words . If you take your name , Silvie , and move the letters around , you get Elvis . " " Oh , " I say , and concentrate harder on my coloring , hooking my feet around the legs of my chair . " You know who Elvis Presley is , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the record . " I am coloring faster , only now I 'm thinking of the dark-haired man with the buttery voice who my mother listens to almost every day , biting her lip and closing her eyes . A net of butterflies unfastens inside my stomach . I do n't want to be named after him-after anybody . Where 's Daddy ? She smiles . " You know those songs we play ? And sometimes we dance ? " " In our pajamas ? " She frowns . " Well , yes . ' Blue Suede Shoes , ' ' Hound Dog , ' ' Jailhouse Rock ? ' Those songs are his , and they 've made him famous . Do you know what famous means ? " Her eyes lift , bright and soft at the same time , like when she straps on the shoes and dances away from me . I do n't feel like answering . " Yes . " I stop coloring and stare down at my half-finished sky . " What ? " she asks . " I do n't know . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when everyone knows who you are . " " Everyone in the whole world ? " I ask , lifting my eyes from my picture . Sometimes , even when I squint my eyes and look right at her , I have trouble seeing her face . With my father , I can stand right up close and see him ; he 's just there , himself . " In the case of Elvis , yes . He 's the most famous-and the greatest-singer who ever lived . Some people might say it 's Frank Sinatra , but they would be wrong . They do n't call Frank Sinatra the King , do they ? " She stabs at crumbs on the place mat , bringing her finger to her lips to taste each one . Then she leans close and her voice drops . " Silvie , I went out with Elvis once . We had a date . " I do n't say a word . I feel her waiting for me to say something , but I do n't like this conversation . I begin to peel the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked . " Before I was married , when I was a teenager , in Biloxi , Mississippi . m-i-s-s-i-s-s-i-p-p-i . " She smiles . " You know , I was n't always a suburban nobody driving around in a white station wagon . " A nobody ? I did n't understand . She was a mother . She sweeps the crumbs into a tiny pile , smiles . " We had to sneak into the back booth in the restaurant so no one would bother us or ask for his autograph . " She looks at me . " That 's when someone famous writes their name and gives it to you . " " I can write my name . " I write my name below the picture I 'm coloring . Slowly . Carefully . Silvie Page . Silvie Page . My name . When I look up , my mother is lost in memory . " He had the most beautiful blue eyes always folded up in that squint , as if he did n't trust just anyone with his heart . And his voice , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drawl that made you feel he had never told anyone even one of the things he was telling you . He wore a gold ring from his mama , and his hands . . . well , his hands were soft as rain . He touched my hand before we ate-a piece of fisherman 's wharf pie , that sublime pie that is n't exactly apple but has cinnamon and nutmeg . And we shared a tall glass of milk with a straw . The strangest coincidence was that he liked ice cubes in his milk . Just like me . " Her remembering voice is quiet , slow , like a music box winding down . " There 's something so romantic about sharing food . "
