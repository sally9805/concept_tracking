THE WEEK AFTER MY DADDY SOWED ME in the marriage furrow , Mama and Selena went arrowheading over at Ocmulgee , walking up from the river to the earth mounds the rattlesnake Creeks raised up to bury their kings and have church , and Mama claimed the Indian spirits from the ground must of smoked up and threw a birth curse while her and Selena was scratching out flints , which was all supposed to explain why I come out of the oven crow-haired and rusty-looking , yodeling and not more sized than a bun . My daddy Strother did n't credit it , though , and he beat Mama near about to death , saying nothing that piddling could be his get , allowing as how I maybe was n't even human and should not be let to live . Miz Revis across the road called up Sheriff Ruffton , and he got there in time to haul Daddy off before Mama was all the way dead , but Daddy never showed his whiskers in Macon after that . I do n't know what become of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure in my life . For a small-built person such as myself , that makes it all worse , though for a spell I was getting by and actually starting to prosper . <p> Mama loved me like a regular baby , never mind my puniness , and she called me " Pet , " though my Christian name was Parham ; Parham Rivers I was , but you know I changed my name to Uke long before I ever cut an album , and people did say it was witchwork , how such a little-biddy body could be attached to such clever fingers . Some folks said I was a midget , a pygmy , a dwarf , and ought to be sent straight to the carnival , but Doc Bowles , he said nossir , I was just little . At first , he figured it was just a stage I 'd ride over and get my growth . Did n't transpire . Doctors do n't know pig shit from sorghum . <p> They was always losing me , Mama and Selena and Jonette , and once when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find them all aweep and turning the house upside-under . The worst thing that almost trage-died out was when Roy Barrett , Daddy 's favorite coon hound , run off with me in his mouth and tried to bury me in the pine woods . Lucky for me it had been a dry summer and the red clay was n't no picnic to tear into , so Selena found us and whipped him with the hoe stick while Mama gave me the rescue . <p> Some people believed I was special blessed and wanted me to touch their babies or their sucking calves once I got to walking myself and talking like somebody with the tongues . I was n't no other help around the house but wiping dishes , shelling peas , or silking corn , which I learned early , and I was a purtee hardship , since Mama had to handsew all my britches , coveralls , and shirts . Shoes was always a problem , and I was afflicted with surprising proportion , organized like a tiny man already and not much baby chubbiness . Youngster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved me ; I guess it was my kitteny disposition and belting out songs from Sunday school all the time . I kept Jesus on my lips and in the house . That was my donation to life . <p> To make me feel more like I belonged , Uncle Laster drove me down to La Grange to see the midget rasslers . Sky Low Low , Pancho the Bull , Bashful , and Mohawk Manny were the openers on the tag-team card , but seeing them trounce and gouge and bellar did n't make me a better fit in the world . Afterwards , I hummed harmony to the radio awhile , then pretended to sleep the rest of the way home . I did n't want to talk about all the flinging and cavorting spectacle of those pint-sized naked specimens , but I made my manners when he dropped me off , lots of " I ' preciate " and " Thank you kindly , " though it did n't really set well with me . Freaks is what they was , and I saw no kinship comfort in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would say a special Samaritan prayer for me , and I sat up front so would n't no heads block my view . Once a rooster come after me in the churchyard and Blister Ferrum had to grab me up or I 'd ' a ' been pecked to death right there on God 's holy ground . <p> I know I 'm being slow now to get this out , but the why of it all do n't allow for short cuts . I was right quick at books but did n't much fancy school , where they laughed at me and was a mite scared at the same time . Chaps can be cruel , and I had to hear " freak " and " pipsqueak " more times than roasting ears has kernels . I could n't hardly tote a satchel , and the teachers was mortified somebody 'd damage or misplace me . First graders was always promising to shut me in a locker . What I did learn there from Miz Isley was that I had the perfect pitch and could tune a piano in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sears for the kiddie fiddle and I learned to stroke it . " Wildwood Flower " was my favorite right off-I 'd heard them spooky Carters on the radio-but I learned " Blessed Assurance " and all the holy ones along with the barndance tunes , and when I was old enough I played a bit at night church and hayrides and such . <p> That made getting day work hard , though , because one time I was playing " Abide with Me " for prayer meeting and I felt myself slipping too deep into the music , like it was the strings that was more important than the worship feel . The notes come up around me like a caul , and I could n't see clearly . The whole world was a sound . Then everybody in the pews commenced to shiver and weep , and when I hit the last chorus , I swear to you the overhead lights started to blink and flicker in time with my strings . It was awful , and afterwards , not many folks came up to thank me . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the congregation held their distance . I kept to myself and played for the hogs and flowers . <p> At last I got prenticed out to Even Whitlaw , the pest killer , who was not churchy and needed a spry helper to go after infesters . I could crawl through folks ' attics and under the floor plan with traps or poison , that being the advantage of my size . I took the Daisy air rifle after fairydiddles nesting under the rafters and learned to figure my money like a storekeeper , which has come in handy . Got so I was n't spooked by your snake nor your rat nor any other vermin , and people snickering did n't hurt the way it used to . My hair browned out and my eyes got bluer . I started to sprout chin whiskers . All in all , I was getting normal except for girls and my size : I quit rising at three feet six . <p> By sixteen years I knowed the fiddle was n't all that suited for my hands , and it hurt my neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willow driftwood . Besides , it was a child 's model I was sawing , and that just did n't set right . That 's when I seen him on Myrna 's Philco-Arthur Godfrey-and he had that ukulele twinging out music that hit my ears just apple-pie perfect . He looked like a Holiness preacher that we 'd see waving his Testament on market morning down under the cracked Confederate statue , but his voice had this soothy tone , all milk and sour-wood honey , and I thought , " I can sing like that . " <p> I had saved out a heap of varmint and bug money , so I got Stella Bresh the pretty mail lady to post off an order to Monkey Ward , who sent me back my first five-string tenor uke , which the Martin factory in Nazareth , Pennsylvania , was making for the catalog people . It was mostly curly koa from Hawaii with rosewood binding , but the best feature was it sported pearl mother inlays of snowflake on the fingerboard , and they always felt so cool to the touch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You likely know Ukulele Ike had awoke the luthiers that there was money in them things , and near about anybody could play them . Pretty soon Pinocchio would come along with " When You Wish Upon a Star , " and that would crank up a bona fide craze . For good luck , I did finally learn " Pua Tuberose , " which I gave a sort of a bluegrass spin , despite it being in Ike 's honor , but mostly I did n't stick to the hula stuff . My voice had a good quaver , and I could be mournful like the whippoorwill . <p> It was Stella herself that eventually took over from Selena to keep me fed and safe and in clothes . I know people will talk and say it 's creepy , me being married to a normal-sized woman , but Stella had drove the mail to our house for years and we always talked , mostly about bagworms or swine fever or the crop weather . Then when she brung that uke , she said , " I want to hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a soft gal with strawberry-blonde curls and a great big old smile , and I was already mooning after her like the bear after the picnic basket . I mean , I went at that uke stick like a firecat , repeating every exercise in the little book . This was before Jumpin ' Jimmy 's teaching series , so I had to fill in a lot myself , but I had the knack , getting good licks right away , learning all the chords , refining , fickling with my fingernails and doubling the strum . In two weeks I did " Toot Toot Tootsie " in G at the mailbox , and she was nearly ' bout won over . The rest of our courting was porch-swinging and talking , or her just sipping tea while I showed off . We 'd go to a diner or church , and I did n't give hoot nor holler what those crackers whispered . <p> Stella was the one that taught me tippling , and she 'd drive me down to the Hollow Log Lounge to play for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I 'd get a little sipping whiskey in my system , I 'd get on the bar and pose like the stuffed bear cub they have on a shelf . I was n't much bigger . Them people laughed with me , and they knew I was wicked on the strings , so they ' predated . I 'd got my hands on a book called Nice Songs for Naughty People , so I kept them laughing and dancing . Them cotton-mill folks took me for myself . They took my heart 's measure and did n't show a mean bone . That 's what being a show can do for you , if you handle it proper . <p> Likely everybody knows that " ukulele " means " jumping flea , " which is what the dark natives on Hawaii said when they saw them Portugueser sailors strumming on the machete de braga , which was what they called their wee-bitty guitars . Some say " uke " is an old word for " gift " in Luau Land , but anybody can see how nimble you 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to dance on a hot skillet . Some will opt out for the mandolin or lute and say how they 're more tricky and able for cleaner frenzy , but my fingers is too frailish to get intricate on the mando 's double strings , and they will cut you . The ukes , though , I 've got a wall of ' em , from the Gibson concert and two Martin M 's to the Kamaka Pineapple and Washburn Taropatch with herringbone purfling . The soundboards all have a sweet sheen , and the strings is mostly nylon or gut , so they wo n't take a mind to bite . <p> When Stella took the Asian , I could n't much help her . The doctor come in and give her pills and even shots , but it was no use . She burned till she went blue cold . Why I did n't get the flu myself is a mystery , but I never took sick from it , and we put her in the ground with lots of yellow flowers . I was planning to plonk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw the clouds brewing , I played " Raindrops Keep Falling " till the sky broke and downpoured till they had to carry me back to the undertaker 's truck . I was shook up after that and would n't hardly leave the house . Mama and them come over and read me scripture and cooked and all , but I wanted to be dead myself . The uke just picked up dust and the strings soured , but one day my eyes fell on the inlay , and the snowflakes seemed to promise life would get better . I knew I 'd never get over losing Stell , but you have to move on , and I know a body might expect me to say something here about the sex part of our love , and how it was . Anybody 'd be curious , but I wo n't talk about that . Some secrets are secret . <p> When the first album come out- Uke Rivers Delivers-I was famous pretty quick . My note-work had took on a sassy tone nobody else could manage , and my voice still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was world-wearied and sad , too . First fairs and festivals and radio from Valdosta to Nashville , with lots of prizes coming my way and so much applause a fly would n't have a Chinaman 's chance of survival in a room where I was playing . Then I went to the big TV Sullivan , who talked to me like a knee baby . You know he had that Mexican mouse puppet and wanted me to sing with it . " Bullshit , " I told them . I gave them a Johnny Rivers kind of treatment on " Somewhere Over the Rainbow , " reeling out the full range of my tiny voice for the first time , and after that , I never again needed to be caresome about money , despite having to order many of my personal goods made special . People wanted Uke everywhere , and my red western-style suits with the cuff braid and my derby hat are famous now . A tailor will even come to my house to measure for them , but it 's not just the garments , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch , cups , and stuff . I 've seen Paris , though , and the queen of London . A music man is a traveling man . <p> But after the second album went gold was when I moved up to Atlanta and had a regular saloon gig at Pick and Strings . The big-city country western crowd adored what I could muster up to be rowdy around , but I kept hymns in my program for Mama and Selena , who would ride the rails up on the Nancy Hanks Local from Macon till Mama took a bad turn from the heart trouble . What made me a star , I expect , was my own songs like " The Lonesome Crow " and " Cropper 's Sorrow " and the spicy string-ring I could conjure for the more mellow stuff . One Christmas Eve when I was singing the mournful ballad of the church fiddler , which I tagged " Shiver and Weep , " all the clocks stopped . Everybody 's watches , too , dead still . It was like The Twilight Zone stories on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jabbering about it , but a fair few slipped away quiet , looking at me over the shoulder . Shoot , it made the papers , and nobody could give it sense . Yeah , that sort of stuff is good for publicity , but I ca n't worry about it . <p> To get by , in the practical way of speaking , I lived with a man helper who could cook and drive and liked to speak to people on the telephone , but life was still pretty low for me since Stella went , and I kept thinking about how a man needs a woman , body needs a body . Size do n't change that . <p> The next winter I met Sunny , who you know became the problem , but I could n't of been happier at first . When I first clapped eyes on her , she was floating across the barroom in a cloud of cigarette smoke , everybody else blurry , but her features clear and shining like something in art . She was copper-headed with pink skin , though her considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared to be shook up by my playing from the get-go and started showing up at Emry 's Pick and Strings on Saturdays about ten , sitting up front on a whirly stool , smoking Herbert Tarrytons and requesting " Ai n't She Sweet " every time . I was happy as a toad in clover to see a small woman with a social side and not cutting the fool at some circus . The first time we had a parley , I learned she was a bona fide midget and had two others in her family . It did n't hold her back none , though . She was smart as a whip , working at Georgia Baptist Hospital with the X-rays , and she rode the bus and bought groceries and all that , had Hank Williams records and a teakettle collection and neighbor friends she shopped and played cards with . She drank those bloody marys , and I 'd send her one from the bar . Pretty soon , we was going other places together , but she was from over to Tennessee , and I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suit them , so I held my horses and chewed my lip . I knew the time would come . <p> When it did , on her pink sofa , I should of knowed there was too much quirk in her coyness to be honest . First time I tried to up and kiss her , she backed off and started talking fast about how ladies need in-surance . She kept sipping her tomato juice drink and saying " Fools rush in " and she was n't no fool . I could n't figure , till she said love should go to marriage or be smothered . I had n't plotted it out that way , but I did n't have no immediate objection . She batted her eyes , and when I started nodding and smiling in agreement , things went swiftly to the private . I will say this , she had the fullest , sweetest lips you could imagine . <p> So I fell for it , and we started planning , getting a few folks lined up , including Emry and his wife and my two sisters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip . Three weeks later , we hitched in what is called a " private ceremony . " I played " O Promise Me " and threw in a lot of technical fancywork and vibrato . The flowers were white , the bride wore blue velvet , and I was decked out in my best scarlet suit and dapper chapeau . The judge himself snapped the pictures . Everybody shuffled and flat-footed when I ended the ceremony with " Cherokee Rose . " <p> Sunny quit her job at the hospital lickety-split , which did n't trouble me at all , and rode the train with me or in the car with Danny my manager-driver who had always been a pearl of a fellow . He was a quiet sort and kindly enough you would n't know he was normal sized . <p> You would n't know he had the women itch , either , not all the time he worked for me . But Sunny seemed to make him blush and stutter at first ; then they got comfortable and chummy and said things in a low voice when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get serious about their drinking , and they 'd give each other the giggles like teen children , and pretty soon , they 'd started to slip out during one of my sets . " Smoking , " they said , but they 'd be gone an hour . It 's a habit I never took up myself , tobacco , but I 'd never known Danny to do that before , either , and although it 's a fact that I 'm bantam-puny and not strong as your average man , I 'm still not stupid . <p> The two of them seemed to have secret codes , because I 'd see a high-sign wink or rolled eyes when they were talking in front of me , and before long , Sunny sort of turned from me . I mean , she 'd shrug off my arm and say in that Olive Oyl voice of hers , " Do n't you need to go practice ? " - like I was some beginner musician . She took to pouting and keeping long silences , coming lively again only when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Danny , well , he became a closer part of our lives than I ever had in mind . It was about that time that Mama died , and I was too shook up to render her favorites at the wake . They just played the disk , and I took to my bed for a week . <p> Last Wednesday night I got wore out from putting in shelves to hold my awards and contest trophies , which had overflowed from the mande a good piece back . Even the power drill is a heavy tool for me , and I do n't care to risk my wrists by overtaxing . When I offered to take Sunny to a Gregory Peck picture show , she allowed as how she 'd as soon stay home , curl up on the couch with Lucy &; Desi . She had a pitcher of tomato drinks and sat there in the fur wrap I had give her for her birthday . It was two foxes all soft and rusty biting one another , but dead , staring glass-eyed at the world , and Sunny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my direction with her limp hand . " Go find an elf party , Jukebox , " she said , and right then I was sure it was time to suss it all out , to just walk around and add things up and ponder . I was in a state , I 'll tell you , feeling jealous and like I was being robbed of my rewards in life . I knowed Sunny was n't no Stella , could n't even come close , but I still calculated respect was n't too much to ask , even from a mini-bitch , even from a drunk . A thin rain was falling , making the streets shine with oily light and distorting the neon store signs . Cars would rush past with a whoosh , and as I walked down Ponce de Leon , I saw the flowers knocked down from the dogwoods by the wind that was prowling around the corners and swooping up here and there . The petals in the air made me think of the uke 's pearly snowflakes my fingers hardly noticed anymore as I squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew I 'd made a mistake this time , since nobody could have the soothing voice and healing touch of Stella . I thought back to those evenings when she 'd come in from her route and take a shower bath to get the road dust off her , and we 'd sit in the parlor , her blowing simple harmony on the French harp , me plucking and strumming " Buffalo Gals , " " Bluesette , " " Arkansas Traveler , " " Delia 's Gone , " and so on . It was peaceful and lightsome and sweet , her eyes as bright as a new thimble . Thinking that was when my fingers began to get the tingling to try some new chord changes I wanted to work into " Midnight Special , " so I whipped around and headed back to the apartment . Besides , I was wet as a stormed-on dog . <p> It 's for true I came in quiet , not rattling the keys nor turning on a light . I was distracted , making straight for the hard-shell case behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't even thinking what I 'd earlier been mulling , about how I needed to know about my wife and Danny and to figure out the rest of my life . I did n't plan no misbehavior , but it was then I heard a tussling on the bed and saw weird figures in the haze of streetlights sliced sharp by the open blinds . Then I could make out Sunny 's little body jumping about , the foxes on her neck flailing in a frenzy . Danny 's voice in the shadows said , " Oh , my baby , oh , " as the mattress spronged , and I could hear the strings snap-ping deep in my heart . I reckon my daddy 's devil side come out in me at last . I did n't even wait to ploy it out . The power drill was still there . A Craftsman , all plugged into the extension . I whipped it up , hopped onto the bed , pushed the bit to his head , and gripped the trigger before they knowed enough to give up moaning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whining , and then the lower drone pitch like after you get through a plank . After that , I just remember a dark spray like a fountain , then the troopers and sirens and red lights flashing around the room . They locked my hands up behind my back with the police bracelets , and somebody said , " Son , you 're arrested . " <p> I reckon that 's all you need to know . It 's the Creek village satchem 's curse coming back on me or maybe my daddy 's own crazy ways , and I do n't figure how the judge can hold me answerable for something that hexy and deep-sourced in the family blood , beyond my doing . Do you spect they 'll let me have one of my snowflake Martins in here while I 'm waiting for trial ? My fingers get all fidgety and stiff and cold when I ca n't strum and fret my way to ease . Mama always said , " Idle hands , idle hands . . . " Do you believe the jury people will hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us all , that I do n't appear to be that normal ? I 'm just glad Mama did n't live to see it , as I expect this will make the papers , too . <p>
