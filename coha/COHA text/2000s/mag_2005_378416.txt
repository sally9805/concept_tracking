The U.S. Special Operations Command , which Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld has given the lead role in the global war on terrorism , does n't just have gun-toting commandos out launching attacks . For the past six months , it has been dispatching two- to four-person teams of psychological warriors to the Pentagon 's overseas commands , armed with plans for pro-U.S. advertising campaigns to counter propaganda from enemies , including Islamic extremists . The teams are part of a new unit called the Joint Psyops Support Element ( JPSE ) , nicknamed " gypsy . " <P> Based at the command 's Tampa , Fla. , headquarters , the JPSE unit has 38 psychological-operations experts ( plus a graphic artist and videographer for film editing ) , a team that is expected to grow to 113 by 2006 , with a projected budget of $77.5 million over the next seven years . JPSE director Jim Treadwell told Time he eventually wants to send those units into Europe , the Middle East , Asia and Latin America , where they would produce commercial-quality television ads , radio spots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ image in those regions . JPSE hopes to award $250,000 contracts next week to as many as four U.S. multimedia companies to develop prototype ad campaigns . Says Treadwell , a former Army psyops colonel : " I want to be as creative as possible . " <P> JPSE 's work could meet resistance , however . Three years ago , the Pentagon shut down its Office of Strategic Influence amid press reports that the unit , whose staff included psyops experts , was mulling a scheme to plant false news items with foreign journalists to sway opinion overseas . The allegations turned out to be unfounded . Senior Administration officials suspect they may have been leaked by military public-affairs officers jealous over turf . But Rumsfeld disbanded the organization anyway , complaining that the negative publicity compromised its effectiveness . The JPSE director insists that his group will not engage in deception . Says Treadwell : " We are always going to tell the truth . " <P>  --  By Douglas Waller                   @ @
