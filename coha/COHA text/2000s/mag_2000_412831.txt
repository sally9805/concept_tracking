Movie folk converge on Italy 's city of canals for 11 days of films , festivities , and fund-raising . by Howard Feinstein // IT WILL GO DOWN AS THE YEAR ITALY DISCOVered gross-out . Several movies in competition at the Venice Film Festival , which ran Aug. 30-Sept. 9 , had audiences squirming . Take the South Korean film The Isle . One woman fainted at a screening , and another threw up , thanks to such images as fishhooks caught in genitalia ( ouch ! ) . The Portuguese film Phantom , about a young stud searching for same-sex kicks , had spectators running for the exits after a toilet scene featuring graphic sex . Thankfully , a few of the 157 films at the 57-year-old festival pushed the limits in a good way-and went home with the top prizes . The Circle , Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi 's story of a group of stigmatized female convicts , garnered the best-film Golden Lion from a jury that included Jennifer Jason Leigh and Milos Forman . Not only was the choice in keeping with past festival winnersVenice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Michael Collins ) - but The Circle was rich in its own controversy . " The Iranian government only gave me permission to show the film three days before the festival , " says Panahi . " I 'm very happy to have finished after a long , hard struggle . " Politics also plays a part in New York artist-turned-filmmaker Julian Schnabel 's Before Night Falls , which took the grand jury prize . Schnabel based his movie on gay Cuban writer Reinaldo Arenas ' memoirs . " I first saw Arenas in a documentary , in which he said , " I do n't legally exist . I 'm homosexual and anti-Castro , " ' says the director . His star , Spain 's handsome Javier Bardem , also garnered best-actor kudos . " I showed the movie to Al Pacino one night , " says Schnabel . " He called Javier at three in the morning to say , It 's a great performance . ' Javier answered , " I believe in two things : God and Al Pacino .

" Do n't piss me off ; it 's early , " barked Stone . " There are evening gowns here more expensive than this . " At the benefit , Schnabel showed why he was still the main attraction . He made an impromptu offer to fashion a portrait out of broken plates if someone would offer to buy it . Stone charitably ponied up $150,000 .

" But even if this year 's slate of films was less than stellar-disappointments included Takeshi Kitano 's Brother , featuring Omar Epps , and Altman 's Dr. T &; the Women , which stars Gere-it still all came down to one thing : location , location , location . Standing outside the Sala Grande before the opening ceremony , Stone managed to sum it up : " The people , the food-which in the old days was n't so good for my modeling-I 've always loved Venice .
