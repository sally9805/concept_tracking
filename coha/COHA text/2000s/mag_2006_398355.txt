Section : Special Report America 's Best Leaders <p> NEW ORLEANS TIMES-PICAYUNE : Team Leadership <p> With floodwaters rising and their headquarters in the path , employees of the Times-Picayune in New Orleans knew they had no choice . On the morning of Aug. 30 , 2005 , more than 200 staffers and family members crowded into a convoy of delivery trucks and fled . <p> Editor Jim Amoss remembers crossing the Mississippi to one of the paper 's suburban bureaus . There was no orderly plan for what to do now that Hurricane Katrina had devastated the city . Phones were n't working ; colleagues worried about their families and homes ; the mood bordered on hysteria . As they debated their next moves , " it became immediately apparent , " Amoss says , " that our very survival as a publication depended on collaboration and cooperation . " <p> The newspaper 's staff ultimately banded together in a remarkable display of grit and ingenuity-succeeding against formidable odds . Their story illustrates a sea change in how leadership occurs . Research by the Center for Creative @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down " approaches , in which a few leaders call all the shots , in favor of more collective processes . In a world of rapidly changing information , the thinking goes , it is simply impossible for a few people to know all they must to make smart decisions . Their success is really tied to the initiative and judgments of people through-out their companies . <p> Few challenges have proved more overwhelming than the destruction wreaked by Katrina . To be sure , the crisis was marked by dismal failures of leadership . But there were inspiring displays of initiative as well . While some involved the heroics of individuals or the directives of military officers , in other cases entire groups exercised leadership on the spot-because they had to . <p> Best-laid plans . The staff of the Times-Picayune was one such group . Of course the paper has designated leaders throughout the organization , and they had planned for a hurricane by acquiring generators and practicing emergency plans . The newspaper had even written articles detailing what a major hurricane could do . <p> But the best-laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generators and no one could communicate , even by cellphone . At the Times-Picayune that 's when a new , unexpected kind of leadership emerged-one in which people at all levels banded together to do what they had to do : put out a newspaper . <p> This was no grand plan directed by senior editors . Katrina " dramatically leveled all hierarchical considerations , " Amoss said . From the newsroom to the loading docks , individuals acted without being asked . And with water and lawlessness consuming New Orleans , it was a risky job . About a dozen journalists led by David Meeks , then the paper 's sports editor , volunteered to return to the city 's center . Their decision , Amoss says , was an " extraordinary moment of spontaneous leadership . " <p> Meeks kayaked downtown to fetch supplies , reporting as he went . Later , in the parts of the city not flooded , Meeks and his crew trudged door to door looking for phone lines . They tried to steer clear of looters and worried about their truck . The members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an art critic , and a religion writer , were n't even accustomed to working with one another . Many stretched well outside the bounds of their expertise . <p> But the group did have two important things in common : a sophisticated knowledge of the city and a passionate desire to work as a team . " This was n't me handing out assignments , " says Meeks , now the paper 's city editor . " This was the group getting together and deciding , ' Where are the areas we have to cover and who 's going to go do it ? ' " The reporters tackled the biggest story of their lives even as they scrounged for food in suffocating heat . <p> Ashton Phelps Jr. , the longtime publisher of the Times-Picayune , says he 's not surprised by the paper 's achievements . " We try to identify and cultivate leaders and have them work in a transparent community that holds them accountable . " <p> After the crisis , the newspaper 's employees continued to break out of their regular jobs . The business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The newsroom and its online affiliate effectively integrated their staffs . <p> New spirit . Collaborative leadership can confuse lines of authority and accountability . And it can be difficult to sustain over a long time , simply because it requires greater coordination . Still , a spirit of increased collaboration is alive and well at the Times-Picayune . Maintaining it is challenging since employees are also dealing with insurance claims , home repair , and scattered family . And in that stressful environment , staff may be tempted to abandon the extra effort . <p> Yet Amoss notices some lasting change . " A more interdependent approach to newsgathering has evolved . By talking more , for example , the city desk and features staff have learned they can help each other on stories . " That kind of walking across the room and working together is much more common than it used to be , " Amoss says . <p> Cooperation is teaching employees that they all have leadership roles to play . " Leadership is not necessarily connected to important-sounding titles , " Amoss says . " Leadership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is more correlated to impulses of courage and responsibility and accountability . " <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : MAKING Do .
