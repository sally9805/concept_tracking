One tiny , red , liquid drop of blood was visible in the center of the small , neat hole in China Bob Chan 's forehead an inch or so above his right eye . Chan 's eyes were wide open . Tommy Carmellini thought his features registered a look of surprise . Carmellini pulled off his right latex glove , bent down , and touched the cheek of the corpsewhich was still warm . Death must have been instantaneous , and not many minutes ago , Carmellini thought as he pulled the glove back onto his hand . The diminutive corpse of China Bob Chan lay sprawled behind his Philippine mahogany desk in the library of his mansion on the south side of Hong Kong Island . When Carmellini had eased the library door open a few seconds ago , he had seen the shod foot protruding from behind the desk . He scanned the room , then entered the library . The side of the room opposite the door consisted of a series of large plate-glass windows accented with heavy burgundy drapes . Through the windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beyond the harbor was the channel between Hong Kong Island and Lamma Island . A few lights could be seen on sparsely populated Lamma , and beyond that island , the total darkness of the South China Sea . Tonight the lights of the great city of Hong Kong , out of sight on the north side of the island 's spine , illuminated a low deck of stratus clouds with a dull glow . The band at the party on the floor below this one was playing an old American pop hit ; the tune was recognizable even though theamplified lyrics were muffled by overstuffed furniture and shelves of books that reached from floor to ceiling . Tommy Carmellini looked around , trying to find the spent cartridge . There , a gleam of brass near the leg of that chair . In the subdued light of the library he almost missed it . He stepped over , bent down , looked . 7.65 millimeter . That cartridge was designed for small , easy-to-conceal pocket pistols . Difficult to shoot accurately , they were serious weapons only at pointblank range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands on his hips and carefully scanned the room . Somewhere in this room Harold Barnes hid a tape recorder eleven days ago when he installed the wiring for a satellite dish system . Presumably Chan had ordered the system so that he could watch American television . Perhaps he was a fan of C-Span , which was broadcasting the congressional hearings concerning foreigni.e. , Chinesedonations to the American political parties in the last election ; in the past ten days his name had certainly been mentioned numerous times in those hearings . Alas , Barnes had left no record of where he hid the recorder . He had been shot in the head the night after he completed the installation . Carmellini was certain Barnes would have used a recorder , not a remote transmitter , which would have been too easy to detect and find . One reason he was certain was that he had known Barnes , a quiet , careful , colorless technician who had gone through the CIA tradecraft course with Carmellini . Who would have suspected that Barnes would be the first of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mikes ... Harold ostensibly spent four hours on the television satellite dish system , a system he should have been able to install in two . If he followed normal practice , he would have hardwired at least two tiny microphones , one for each track of the recorder . The chandelier over the mahogany desk caught Tommy 's eye . Ornate , with several dozen small bulbs , it would attract Harold Barnes like sugar attracts a fly . Carmellini studied the chain that held the chandelier . There was a wire running down it ... no , two wiresone black wire and the other smaller , carefully wound around the chain . Barnes could have put a mike in the chandelier , another anywhere in the roommaybe the desk or over by the reading areaand hidden the recorder behind some books , perhaps on the top shelf . Surely there were tomes that did n't get removed from the shelves once a decade . Carmellini stepped to the nearest bookcase , studied the spines of the books that filled the thing . Not a flake of dust . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled a chair over under the chandelier , then stood on it . Aha ! There it was , taped in the junction of the main arms of the chandelier . With the bulbs of the chandelier burning brightly , the tiny recorder would have been almost impossible to see from the floor . Carmellini reached . In seconds he had the two reels out . Maybe three-quarters of the tape had been used , about six hours ' worth . Back on the floor , he was tempted to put the reels into his pocket , then thought better of it . He pulled up a trouser leg and carefully shoved them down into one sock . He had a new tape in his other sock , but with China Bob dead , the recorder seemed superfluous . Should he cut the wires and remove the device ? How much time did he have ? If China Bob Chan killed Harold Barnes , why was the recorder still there ? Was he waiting for someone to come for the tape ? Suddenly aware that time was fleeing , Tommy Carmellini @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously rubbed the upholstered seat of the chair to remove any marks his shoes had made . As he straightened , he heard a noise . It seemed to come from the secretary 's office . When he stepped in that direction the light in the smaller office came on . Carmellini moved swiftly and flattened against the wall . The door to the secretary 's office was to his right . He listened intently for footsteps . Carmellini desperately wanted to avoid being caught in this room with a dead man on the floor and a tape in his sock . True , he had diplomatic immunity as the assistant agricultural officer at the consulate , but the publicity and hullabaloo of an arrest and interrogation , not to mention expulsion from the country , would not be career-enhancing . He heard the scrape of a chair being moved . Coiled , ready to lash out if anyone came through the door , he approached it , staying back far enough that he remained away from the glare of the light . Someone was sitting behind the secretary 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid ! A boy , perhaps ten or twelve . Carmellini stepped back so he would be out of sight if the youngster glanced this way . Now he heard a computer boot up . There was one other exit from this room , at the far end . Carmellini did n't know if the door was locked , but it led to another suite of offices which opened into the hallway near the elevator . He walked toward the door , moving quietly and decisively . The knob refused to turn . Locked . There was a keyhole , but he could not see the brand name or type of lock . He removed a leather packet from his pocket and unfolded it , revealing a carefully chosen selection of picks . He took one , inserted it in the lock . As he bent down to work on the lock , he saw for the first time the heads of the bolts in the door . They had been painted the same dark color as the door to make them less noticeable . Even if he got the lock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pick away and stowed the packet in an inside jacket pocket as he walked back toward the secretary 's open door . Standing at least six feet from the door , he moved so he could see inside . The kid was at the computer , typing . Now he sat back in the chair , waiting ... In seconds a naked woman appeared on the screen , a woman holding what appeared to be a giant penis in her hand . Now she Jesus , the kid is into porno ! Just what the woman was going to do with the penis , Tommy Carmellini never discovered , for at that instant the door from the hallway opened and a woman walked in . The boy took one look at the intruder and closed the screen , but not before the woman got a good look at it . She cuffed him once , said something in Chinese . The boy ran through the icons , closed the Internet connection as the woman spouted Chinese as quickly as her lips would move . Carmellini stepped back against the wall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the scrape of the chair and footsteps , then the door to the hallway close firmly . He peered into the office . Empty . He opened the hallway door a crack , just enough to see the woman and boy disappear into the elevator at the end of the hallway . He paused for a second , then went back into the library and scooted the chair under the chandelier . Installing the new tape in the recorder took about thirty seconds ; then he found the on-off switch and turned off the recorder . He put the chair back where it belonged and rubbed the seat again . At the door in the secretary 's office , Carmellini checked to ensure no one was coming , then stepped into the hallway and pulled the door shut until it latched . Strains of Gershwin 's " An American in Paris " were audible here . As he walked toward the staircase that led to the rooms below where the party was being held , Carmellini stripped off his latex gloves and put them in his pocket . Downstairs he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long-haired intellectual type who was gazing hopefully at her . Kerry was a tall English woman with a spectacular mass of reddish brown hair who spoke both Cantonese and Mandarin fluently . On most working days she labored as a translator at the Greater China Mutual Aid Society , an insurance firm , but in reality she was an officer in the British Secret Intelligence Service , the SIS . Tonight she was wearing an elegant dark blue dress that just brushed her ankles and a modest borrowed diamond necklace . " Oh , there you are , darling , " she said lightly , laying a hand on Tommy 's arm . " I have been talking to this brilliant playwright " She said his name . " His new play is opening next week in the West End . My sister told me quite a lot about it , actually . What a coincidence ! When we get back to London we must see it . " Carmellini shook hands with the scribbler and gently led Kerry away . " Did anyone watch me come in ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hubbub of cocktail party chatter and music . " I do n't think anyone was paying much attention . What were you doing up there ? " " Watching porno on the Internet . Fascinating stuff ! I 'll tell you all about it later . Who is this sicko stalking you ? " He was referring to a Chinese man who was standing six feet away and openly staring at Kerry . When she moved , he moved . " An admirer from the provinces , obviously , hopelessly smitten . All my life I 've had this devastating effect on men . It 's such a bore . I 'm thinking of having chest reduction surgery to end these unwanted attentions . " That comment was intended as a joke , for Kerry had a slim , athletic figure . Carmellini snarled at the staring man and guided Kent away by the elbow . " Did you get it ? " She meant the tape . " It was n't there . China Bob is stretched out behind his desk with a hole in his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Very . " " You found the recorder ? " " In the chandelier . But the tape was missing . " Kerry Kent sipped champagne as she digested Carmellini 's lie . Just why lying to her was a good idea he could n't say , but his instinct told him not to trust anyone . Someone shot Harold Barnes , and another someone , perhaps the same one , put a bullet in China Bob Chan 's headand Carmellini had known Ms. Kent for precisely three days , not exactly a long-term relationship . There were at least three ways to get from this floor of the mansion to the floor above : two staircases and an elevator . Carmellini had slipped up one set of stairs after he went to the men 's room , which was out of sight of the ballroom , just down the hall toward the back stairs . Anyone in this room could have done precisely the same thing in the last few hours , and probably several of them had . Perhaps the tape held the answer . Carmellini scanned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guests in his mind . The cream of Hong Kong society was here tonight . " Tell me again , " he said to Kerry Kent , " who these folks are . " She scanned the crowd , nodded toward a man in his sixties in the center of a small crowd . " That 's Governor Sun Siu Ki , surrounded by his usual entourageofficials and bureaucrats and private industry suck-ups . The gentleman of distinction talking to him is Sir Robert MacDonald , the British consul general . The tall , blond Aussie semi-eavesdropping on those two is Rip Buckingham , managing editor of the China Post , the largest English-language daily in Hong Kong . Beside him is his wife , Sue Lin . Over in the far corner is the American consul general , Virgil Cole , talking to China Bob 's sister , Amy Chan . Let 's see , who else ? " " The fellow in the uniform with the highball , standing by the band . " " General Tang , commanding the division of People 's Liberation Army troops stationed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few weeks . The papers ran articles about him when he arrived . " " The man talking to him ? " " Albert Cheung . Educated at Oxford , the foremost attorney in Hong Kong . Smooth and silky and in the know , or so I 've heard . " She continued , pointing out six industrialists , three shipping magnates , and two bank presidents . " These people are the scions of the merchant and shipping clans that grew filthy rich in Hong Kong , " she said , and named names . " If ever a group mourned the departure of the British , there they are , " she added . " Never saw so much of the upper crust chatting it up together . " Any person in the room could have gone upstairs and popped China Bob , Carmellini reflected . All of them had probably excused themselves and gone in search of the facilities once or twice during the evening . Or someone could have ridden the elevator from the basement or walked to the library from another area of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tommy Carmellini took one more careful look at each of the people Kerry had pointed out , then said , " Perhaps we should leave now before the excitement begins . " " A marvelous suggestion . Let me say a few good-byes as we drift toward the door . " Five minutes later , as they stood waiting for the consulate 's pool car to be brought around , Carmellini asked Kerry , " So what 's on the agenda for the rest of the evening ? " " I do n't know , " she said lightly and turned toward him . He accepted the invitation and kissed her . She put her arms around him and kissed back . " You are such a romantic , " she said when her lips were free . " And single , too . " " I have n't forgotten . " " I do n't recall mentioning my marital status before . " " You did n't . Your reputation preceded you . Tommy Carmellini , unmarried burglar , thief , second-story man ... " " And all-around good egg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Do n't knock the recipe until you 've tried it . " " You 'll have to sell me . " " I 'm willing to give it a go , as you Brits say . " " Tell me about the Internet pornography . Little details like that spice up action reports , make them interesting . " The consulate pool car pulled to a stop in front of them , and the valet got out . " I was saving that morsel for later , " Carmellini said as he tipped the man and accepted the keys . " After all , the night is young . "
