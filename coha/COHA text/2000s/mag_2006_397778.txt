Inspired by inventors Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison , the other " Indiana Jones " is revolutionizing the way we communicate and live . <p> The people on Scott Jones ' Christmas card list got much more than the traditional message of peace , joy and good will for 2006 . Into each season 's greeting Jones placed Thomas Friedman 's best-seller , The World Is Fiat . The book is an intriguing blend of economic prophecy ( the digital revolution belongs to the basement entrepreneur ) and cautionary tale ( if we do n't watch it , the United States will fall behind countries with better educational systems ) . <p> The message so resonated with Jones that he had to share it with 275 of his closest friends . It 's a message he hopes will Jolt politicians into action to reassert U.S. leadership in math , science and engineering  --  the fields that drive the economy . <p> " We 're not a stand-alone country , " says Jones , a 45-year-old businessman best known as the inventor of voice mall . " China and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of those Jobs that have existed here for the last century . We may be coming into a new era of world growth and expansion when the United States is n't necessarily leading . An important message that I took away from this is : We 're falling behind in the area of science and engineering . We 're probably falling behind in inventions as well . " <p> Jones , the holder of a dozen patents , is the kind of entrepreneur Friedman lifts up as the model in a globally connected world . Jones lives in Carmel , Indiana , but can do business with any place , from Just about anywhere . Like Friedman , Jones sees the world as flat : so connected by technology that traditional geographic and political barriers no longer matter . <p> Born in 1960 , Jones knew early on that be would pursue a life of scientific inquiry . Be was fascinated by gadgets , electricity and the stories of famous inventors like Benjamin Franklin and Thomas Edison . As a seven-year-old , Jones fiddled with his father 's electric train @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a teen , his idea of fun was a trip to Radio Shack . <p> " I have several memories of making messes , " he says , recalling one in particular when he disassembled his journalist mother 's Selectric typewriter . " She said something was n't working quite right , either the return key or the space bar or something . Electrics are pretty complicated . She told me that , then she went to bed . I ripped the whole thing apart into single , individual pieces of which there were hundreds . And it was all spread out on the kitchen table when she got up in the morning . She was furious at me because that was her livelihood . I then put it back together again . " <p> Thank goodness , it worked . <p> After graduating with honors from Indiana University with a degree in computer science , Jones got a Job as a research scientist at MIT 's Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in Boston . There he got to dabble in robotics , vision systems , optical storage , parallel computing , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In 1986 , Jones cofounded his first company , Boston Technology , Inc. , where he created the voice mail system used today by some 500 million people . Jones is quick to point out that he did n't invent voice mail . Someone by the name of Gordon Matthews did that . and " he 's referenced in my patents . " <p> An analogy is the automobile . " The car was invented in the late 1800s by a few different people at a similar time , but it was n't until Henry Ford came out with a version that was economically viable that it really took off , " Jones says . " So that 's what I did . I created the economically viable version of voice mall that is in the telephone companies and can scale up to handle millions of users . " <p> After returning to Indiana , Jones founded Escient Technologies , which developed products that performed data storage , music management and similar tasks that integrated home entertainment and the Internet . Then , he moved into an even more novel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indy Robotics , is comprised of engineers , software developers and marketing professionals . Their mission is to build the world 's first fully autonomous vehicle . <p> " Over a hundred of us got together and , in a year 's time , came up with a full-size Jeep that drives itself , and when you throw obstacles in its way , it sees them and avoids them , " Jones says . The vehicle was scheduled to race last October in a Pentagon-sponsored unmanned vehicle competition in the Mojave Desert , but it crashed during a test run due to a programming glitch . <p> The technology , however , is moving full speed ahead . To hear Jones tell it , the stuff of science fiction is reality . <p> " The near term applications are things that would happen in controlled environments : farming the fields , snow plowing on runways , " says Jones . If computers drive the tractors , farmers can manage the business and increase their profit margin , Jones explains . " Ultimately . in 20 to 30 years , you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back and gets the kids and takes them to school and is safer than what we 're experiencing today with human drivers . " <p> For the United States , the real obstacle to success in a global economy is not the absence of ideas , but the lack of political will to make scientific innovation a priority . According to Jones , the United States does n't adequately value the critical role science , math and engineering are playing in the 21st century . If It did , our public policies would do far more to nurture young minds . <p> " I think I can count on one hand how many scientists and engineers are in Congress , for example . In China or in India , you have more of a technocracy . You certainly have the understanding that 's where the future is , that inventiveness , new ideas , new technologies , are going to be the source of tomorrow 's wealth , just as they were the source of wealth in the United States today . " <p> " Our public policy does not support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into science and engineering fields ; statistics show that the number of graduates in science and engineering is going down . " <p> " We have to find a way to get more science and engineering-trained people into Congress so that the right public policies are made , whether it relates to energy or nanotechnology . " <p> The United States continues to rank near the bottom in math and science achievement among 21 countries that participated in the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study . <p> Even more worrisome , U.S. universities and colleges award significantly lower numbers of university science and engineering degrees than their Asian and European counterparts . In 1997 , Asia and Europe awarded 640,000 more science and engineering degrees than the United States . By 2000 , the gap had grown to 777,000 . <p> Says Jones , " In China and India , they 're producing ten times as many science and engineering graduates as we 're producing every year . That was n't true 15 years ago . They were sending their students over here , and many of them were staying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting educated here , they 're going back home . The education systems in China and India are improving so they can actually do research in their home country . " <p> When one considers the bleeding-edge technologies in genomics , stem ceil technology and nanotechnology , also called molecular manufacturing , the United States almost seems to be taking a back seat . " I do not know where the United States is going to end up on that , but these are areas where we ought to be paying a lot of attention . " <p> Might Jones put his money where his mouth is and run for Congress ? <p> Not in the near future . " I 'm quite busy with my pursuits with new technologies . But I would n't rule it out in a decade or two . " <p> In The World Is Flat . Friedman con tends the future will belong not to global conglomerates but to desktop freelancers and innovative startups . Because the world has been flattened by digital technology , he predicts , " the next great breakthrough in bioscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Egypt . <p> Not far off the mark , Jones says . " I had lunch with a woman inventor today . She is doing it basically in the garage , the kitchen . I love to see that kind of inventiveness , I think that is where it 's going to happen . Even technologies like genomics can happen in your garage . " <p> Jones does his own inventing not in a high rise office but in his 27,000-square-foot mansion in Carmel , which he has remodeled into an extraordinary model of high-tech gadgetry and comfort . <p> " I 'm believing I can create the next search engine technology . maybe not in the basement but in the breakfast room , " says Jones , who 's seeking a patent for a development that he says leapfrogs anything Google provides . The technology would immediately produce only the most relevant in formation , and would be available on command using just a cell phone . <p> If Jones ' invention delivers the " perfect search " as promised , it will help not only the 15-year-old prodigy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history student sweating over a ten-page term paper assignment in his bedroom . <p> Like voice mail , the invention would touch millions of lives . That 's what Friedman means when he says the world is flat . In a global economy , Carmel , Indiana , and Calcutta , India , are really just nanoseconds apart . <p> SCOTT JONES CIRCA 1978 <p> <p> Always on the cutting edge , Scott Jones , CEO of Indy Robotics , is moving full speed ahead in developing an unmanned , fully autonomous robotic vehicle that boasts wide-ranging applications  --  from the way we travel , the way firefighters enter burning buildings , the way bomb squads search for explosive devices , the way we till our fields , and many others . <p> <p> By Andrea Neal <p>
