How to soothe your little one-and yourself // I was so prepared for my first baby . I had survived Lamaze classes , knew how to operate a breast pump ( at least in theory ) , and had enough diapers for quintuplets . What I did n't anticipate were the hours of crying : I came completely unglued at the sound of Mathilda 's heartrending wails . I vividly remember sitting in my new rocking chair , holding her on my shoulder while she screamed and I sobbed , thinking it was never going to end . " Why did I have a baby ? " I blubbered more than once . " I 'm not cut out to be a mother . " Every new mom has been there . Your baby is shrieking , you have no clue how to calm her , and you would give your life savings to someone who could tell you how to stop it . " I remember one night when Carly was a newborn , and she screamed from 5 P.M. to 1 A.M. , " says Sally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The only time she would stop was when I nursed her . It was one of the most stressful times of my life . " What 's important to remember is that all infants have unexplained periods of fussiness during their first few months . " Crying does n't reflect on your parenting skills , " says Marc Weissbluth , M.D. , author of Your fussy Baby . " Crying is universal behavior , in all cultures . As I like to say : " Birds fly , babies cry . ' ' " Still , realizing that baby tears are normal does n't make them easy to live with . But there are ways to get your baby-and yourself-through this tough period , once you know what you 're up against . The lowdown on Babies ca n't tell us " I 'm hungry , " " I 'd like to get out of this car seat , " or " This itchy tag is driving me crazy ! " So they cry . The challenge is not to take it personally . Marjorie Carlson , a mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in Sewickley , Pennsylvania , came up with a method that helped her empathize with her babies . " I tried not to think of their cries as annoying sounds , " she says . " I imagined it was their way of saying " Mom , I need you ! ' ' " But then , it might sound like your baby needs you all the time . In fact , a newborn cries for an average of three hours a day , peaking at around 6 weeks . By 3 months , your baby 's crying will probably subside to about one hour a day . Of course , even a short crying jag can seem like an eternity to any mom , especially one who 's exhausted and overwhelmed . " When you 're in the postpartum period , five minutes can feel like two hours , " says Maureen O'Brien , Ph.D. , a developmental psychologist with The First Years and the mother of 11-year-old twins . " At the same time your baby is going through the initial crying period , you 're adjusting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deprivation and postpartum hormones . It 's all bundled together : the baby 's crying and your own ability to cry on a dime . " What the tears do to moms It 's not your imagination : Your baby 's cries affect you in a way that other aggravating noises ( chain saws , barking dogs , a too-loud television ) do n't . " Moms have a biological response when babies cry , " says Robert Sears , M.D. , coauthor of The Premature Baby Book . Their infant 's cry triggers release of the hormone prolactin , dubbed " the mothering hormone , " which creates an urge to pick the baby up and meet his needs . So it 's actually a good sign that your baby 's wailing gets to you like nothing else , Dr. Sears says . Because we 're wired to respond this way , we moms tend to be tough on ourselves when our babies keep right on crying . Tara Feaster of Bronx , New York , felt guilty when she could n't immediately soothe her newborn daughter Cassandra , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that my baby deserved better , " she says . Even more experienced moms feel the pressure . Christine D'Amico , a mom of three ( Max , 6 , Charlie , 4 , and Francesca , 1 ) in San Diego and the author of The Pregnant Woman 's Companion , says that her babies ' cries often pushed her to the limit . " I would obviously never do it , but I realized why kids get shaken to death , " she says . " You reach that really frustrated place , and you just do n't know what to do . " The fine art of baby soothing Fortunately , there are as many ways to calm a crying baby as there are , well , crying babies . My daughter Mathilda , now 9 , settled down when my husband , Tony , rocked her on his shoulder-but only if he stood on a certain squeaky floorboard in our living room . Her brother , A.J. , now 7 , was a rocking-chair man . And my 1-year-old , Mary Elena , fussed in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroller . Other infants will only quiet down with a drive in the car , an hour in the baby swing , or after being tightly swaddled . Dimming the lights , turning on relaxing music , or stripping a baby down to her diaper are other tried-and-true methods . You may need to experiment to figure out what clicks . When her 4-month-old duaghter , Hannah Olivia , cried for three hours , Nicole Leon of Hollywood , Florida , tried rocking , feeding , and walking , but nothing worked . In desperation , Nicole ran a warm bath and got in with her baby . " It did soothe her , so we spent the rest of the afternoon there , " she says . " Now I know that whenever she gets fussy , a bath always works . " Do n't underestimate the power of distraction either . " Cassandra always stopped crying and shifted her attention when either of our cats walked by , " says Feaster . It may seem counterintuitive , but adding even more noise to a crying baby 's environment may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noise during her first six months of life , " says Maxson . " We would run the sweeper or turn on my hair dryer . It was the only thing that worked consistently . " Play around with various positions , too . Some babies are happiest slung over a shoulder , but others enjoy being held across your forearm , tummy down , like footballs . You can also try humming or singing while you hold your baby close ; in addition to the sound , the vibrations from your voice box can be soothing to her . Needless to say , do n't overlook the obvious problems . Make sure your baby is dry , fed , and burped . " One day , my two-month-old daughter , Phoebe , had been crying for a long time , " says Denise Mussman of St. Louis . " Finally , I rubbed my fingers gently along her spine , starting at the bottom and working my way up . She let out a tremendous belch , and then she was fine . " Do n't neglect yourself No surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stress . It 's a vicious cycle . The baby cries , his mom gets anxious , he cries even harder . To break the chain , you 've got to figure out a way to soothe yourself , whether it 's putting on headphones for ten minutes or ( ideally ) handing the baby off to a trusted friend or relative while you take a hot shower or just a much-needed break . Another vital step : Do your best to get out of the house and spend time with other people . There 's something about the act of socializing-even if it 's just exchanging pleasantries with a coffee-shop clerk-that brings us back to reality . ( Also , babies in strollers are less apt to cry ; they love motion , fresh air , and a change of scenery . ) Sometimes , too , a reality check is in order . Logging the actual minutes of crying can help put things in perspective , says O'Brien , because you 're likely to discover your baby does n't cry as much as you think she does . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fussiest periods are and help yourself remember which soothing techniques work and which do n't , " she says . If all else fails-you 've tried everything , your baby is still crying , and you 're in danger of losing control-put her in a crib or another safe place and take a time-out in another room . Crying alone for a little while wo n't hurt her . The big picture No matter how awful your baby 's crying seems , take heart . It will soon be over . I used to be appalled when well-meaning strangers ( usually older women ) would stop me with my fussy newborn and say , " Enjoy this stage ; it goes so fast . " What planet were they on ? Enjoy being sleep-deprived and constantly frazzled ? At the time , I thought their comments were further proof that there must be something wrong with me . But now , with two more kids and almost a decade of perspective under my belt , I understand what they meant . After three months , your baby 's crying jags will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be cooing , blowing kisses , and saying " Ma-ma " and " Dada . " Even if you never become an expert at decoding her cries ( I could never distinguish " hungry " from " overstimulated " ) , the crying phase will soon be over , and you 'll be on to other challenges-like listening to her chatter nonstop through the toddler years . Sidebar 3 things not to do * Pop in a pacifier right away . Yes , it might quiet him , but you do n't get the chance to figure out what 's really wrong . * Rush to feed him . If you stick a bottle or your breast in your baby 's mouth every time he cries and before you 're sure he 's hungry , you could be showing him that eating is a way to comfort himself . That can eventually lead to overeating. * Try too many different ways of soothing at once . It takes a while for soothing techniques to work . If you quickly change positions or swaddle and then unswaddle immediately , your baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : It takes time to learn what comforts best Sidebar Decoding the wails Hunger ? Boredom ? Exhaustion ? Forget trying to figure out the nuances among the different types of cries , says Robert Sears , M.D. " Most newborns have only one cry-loud and demanding , " he says . But keep these general guidelines in mind : * When he 's hungry , a baby will quietly fuss and squirm . If he is n't fed , the cry will escalate . ( Unless he 's a newborn , and then the big wails are likely to start right away . ) If he 's in pain-from gas , teething , or illness-your baby will probably have a piercing cry . He 'll be difficult for you to console , and usually wear a pained expression . * Newborns have a very distinct , high-pitched wail . They take in short , rapid breaths and let out a short crying sound each time they exhale. begin to breathe in deeper when crying , so each cry is longer .
