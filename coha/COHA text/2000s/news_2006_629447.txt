RONNIE MONTGOMERY : FOR THE CHRONICLE , 2 . R. MONTGOMERY : CHRONICLE @x The Curious Case of Benjamin Button Brad Pitt , Cate Blanchett , Julia Ormond , Taraji P. Henson PG-13 4 stars CRITIC 'S CHOICE DRAMA Here 's a big , emotional movie that works , and does so beautifully . The Curious Case of Benjamin Button uses the very latest in digital special effects to bring dazzlingly to the screen the most old-fashioned of stories , one of a love that withstands the test of time . That 's time in its most literal sense . The movie 's hero , Benjamin Button ( Pitt ) , is born an old man in a wizened infant 's body and proceeds to age backward , growing ever more sprightly and gorgeous as the years pass . Meanwhile , everyone to whom he is close , including the woman ( Blanchett ) he loves for a lifetime , ages in the normal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who we are , or merely the wrinkles we wear ? And how do the passage of time and our life experiences change us ? Very loosely based on a 1922 short story by F. Scott Fitzgerald , Button is directed with elegance and restraint by David Fincher ( Fight Club ) . Pitt , whether grizzled or a radiant youth , gives an insightful performance that makes clear his character 's growing understanding that , while nothing lasts , life is to be lived and love matters . Gran Torino Clint Eastwood , Ahney Her , Bee Vang R 3 stars Like the aging lion that he is , Eastwood growls -- a purring , threatening " Grrrrrr "  - -  to eloquent effect in this immensely enjoyable film . Essentially , Gran Torino is Dirty Harry Develops a Social Conscience . Eastwood , who also directed with his usual efficiency , plays widower Walt Kowalski , a bitter , bigoted former autoworker in Detroit who disapproves of his new neighbors , a family of Hmong immigrants . How he learns to appreciate them and their culture , and to help the family 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're threatened by a local gang , is at the generous heart of this terrific movie . Torino , and Clint , will make your day . The Wrestler Mickey Rourke , Marisa Tomei , Evan Rachel Wood R 3 stars DRAMA Where would pro wrestling , or Hollywood , be without sentimental comebacks from grizzled veterans ? Rourke , playing a once-famous grappler on the comeback trail , makes a spectacular return to top form in an earnest , sweaty drama . The Wrestler is a moving character study of Randy " the Ram " Robinson ( Rourke ) , who , despite trying hard , ca n't figure out a life for himself outside the ring . Rourke portrays Randy with such depth of feeling , and delicacy , that you share his every bruise . Tomei , as his stripper girlfriend , and Wood , as his estranged daughter , are excellent as well . Valkyrie Tom Cruise , Bill Nighy PG-13 3 stars ACTION Valkyrie tells the true story of a group of disillusioned German officers and politicians , led by Col. Claus von Stauffenberg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1944 Knowing the ending ahead of time ( non-spoiler : Hitler died by his own hand in 1945 ) sort of puts a damper on just how much suspense the movie , directed with visual panache by Bryan Singer ( Superman Returns ) , can generate . Surprisingly , Valkyrie does a decent job of ratcheting up the thrills until two-thirds of the way through , when the bomb von Stauffenberg has planted near the Fhrer goes off and , uh , well , nice try , guys . Cruise , sporting an eye patch and an empty sleeve ( von Stauffenberg lost an eye and a hand in battle ) , alternates here between being grim , determined and noble , all apt choices given the circumstances . Doubt Meryl Streep , Philip Seymour Hoffman PG-13 3 stars DRAMA It 's the Meryl and Phil show . Doubt , the movie version of the 2005 Tony- and Pulitzer-winning Broadway play , provides two top talents the chance to rock and roll righteously . Adapted and directed ( shakily ) by John Patrick Shanley ( Joe Versus the Volcano ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , in 1964 , confronts a progressive priest ( Hoffman ) whom she suspects is molesting a boy at the school where she is principal . In making its point about the ambiguity of certitude , the film keeps you guessing throughout as to which of these two is right . Doubt 's intellectual trappings seem thinner here than onstage , but Streep and Hoffman are both so superb it is pure delight just to watch ' em work . BOX KERI RUSSELL READY FOR BEDTIME * The actress , 32 , stars with Adam Sandler in Bedtime Stories , about fairy tales that come to life . HOW DID YOU LIKE PLAYING A MERMAID IN ONE SCENE ? I wear a major hairpiece and am painted from head to toe with a huge prosthetic tail . It was intense . It took hours to get it on and off , and going to the bathroom is elaborate . DO YOU READ STORIES TO YOUR SON RIVER ? He is only 1 1/2 , and the drag is at that age , you read one page and he 's like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're like , " But I like this part ! " BOX ALSO PLAYING NOTHING LIKE THE HOLIDAYS There 's never a silent night in a Christmas comedy . The default plot , including here , features adult children coming home to spend Noel arguing loudly with each other , their folks and spouses . Set in Chicago , Nothing 's twist is that the family is Puerto Rican and the parents are on the verge of splitting . The movie is sweet and the cast ( including Melonie Diaz and Freddy Rodriguez , below ) likable , but you 've opened this same present before . ( PG-13 ) 2 stars BOX BELLS ARE STILL RINGING FOR IT 'S A WONDERFUL LIFE 'S ZUZU * Watching It 's a Wonderful Life is a holiday tradition for many , but for Karolyn Grimes , 68 , who played Zuzu in the 1946 film , it 's a full-time job . DID YOU KNOW HOW BIG THE FILM WOULD BE ? It was a box office failure , so it was a shocker when it started becoming popular after it became public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did a couple of interviews and started getting fan mail . I about fell over dead ! WHAT WAS JIMMY STEWART LIKE ? He 's very tall -- 6 ' 4 "  - -  but he was always so gentle . I blew a line once and I felt really bad . He said , " That 's all right ! You 'll do it right the next time ! " And I did . He gave me the confidence to get it right . DID YOU WATCH THE FILM WITH YOUR KIDS LIKE SO MANY OTHER FAMILIES DO ? No , I never did . I felt like if I watched the movies I was in , I 'd be tooting my own horn , so I never did that . Now I do hundreds of appearances a year , so I watch it a lot ! &nbsp;
