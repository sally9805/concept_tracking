His pal persuaded Sommers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One day in the mid- ' ' 90s Sommers went to the bank and discovered all his money was gone-frittered away by his friend 's bad investments and shady deals . Sommers sued his friend and won the case , but spent much of his $887,000 settlement paying off lawyers and debts . To make ends meet during the case he took the pizza-delivery job . " People recognized me and it was humiliating , " says Sommers , 36 . " One minute I 'm famous and five years later I 'm broke . It 's been a roller coaster ride . " Single and living near Detroit , Sommers now does construction work and is a racecar driver trying to make it big in NASCAR .

Then her 25-year-old boyfriend proposed-and told her she 'd have to buy her own ring , promising to pay her back . She ended up dumping him .

" He 's got his own money , " Rogers says . " He bought me my ring . " Andrew " Jack " Whittaker , 56 Won : $314.9 million Outcome : Embarrassing busts , stolen bucks As Andrew " Jack " Whittaker should be able to attest , tippling and toting around large stashes of cash do n't make for a winning ticket . Since bagging the largest single Powerball jackpot ever on Christmas Day , 2002 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contractor from Scott Depot , W.Va. , has survived a series of misadventures that sound like something from The Sopranos . During the past eight months Whittaker , 56 , has been drugged at a strip club and robbed of $545,000 ( it was recovered ) ; arrested for threatening to have a bar manager and his family killed ( he faces a March court date ) ; and charged with drunk driving after state police found him sitting in his Cadillac SUV on the side of the interstate on Jan. 25 , allegedly slumped over the wheel with the vehicle running . Said Whittaker , whose blood-alcohol level registered 0.190 , twice the legal limit : " I was n't driving , absolutely was n't driving . " Many locals seem inclined to view Whittaker 's troubles tolerantly , however , especially since he earmarked $14 million to establish a foundation that delivers food , clothing and scholarships to the state 's poor . " I just keep on doing what I 'm doing , " Whittaker said after his DUI arrest , " and tell everyone my personal life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 50 Won : $31 million Outcome : Lost his marriage-and his life Billie Bob Harrell Jr . was just about broke when he played the Texas Lotto Jackpot in June 1997 . But then six ping-pong balls landed the right way and Harrell , 48 , was $31 million richer . He quit his job at Home Depot and with his first $1.24 million check took his family to Hawaii , gave tens of thousands to his church , lavished cars and houses on friends and family . He even bought 480 turkeys for the poor . " He played Santa Claus , " says his mother , Agnes . " He seemed to think everything would be all right . But it never was the same again . " Suddenly strangers were calling demanding donations ; Harrell changed his phone number several times . The strain of it all damaged his marriage , and less than a year after winning Harrell split from his wife . Reckless spending and lending led him to make a bad deal with a company that gives lottery winners lump-sum payments in exchange for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less than what he had won . But by then , it seemed , all he wanted was to have his family back . One night in 1999 , just before he was set to meet his ex-wife for dinner , his oldest son found him dead of a shotgun wound . " Winning the lottery , " Harrell had earlier told a friend , " was the worst thing that ever happened to me . " Today Harrell 's mother does not believe her son took his own life , despite a police report ruling it a suicide . In the bedroom that night police found a note they believe was meant for his ex-wife . " I did n't want this , " Harrell wrote . " I just wanted you . " Denise Rossi , 53 Won : $1.3 million Outcome : Stripped of her winnings Blindsided-that 's how Thomas Rossi felt when Denise , his wife of 26 years , hit him with divorce papers in 1997 . " I thought we got along good , " says Rossi , 70 , a photographer . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the house very fast . It was n't like her to act this way . " Two years later it all made sense . A letter addressed to his ex-wife that mistakenly arrived in his new Los Angeles apartment revealed she had won a lottery . Rossi learned Denise had scored $1.3 million in the California lottery on Dec. 28 , 1996-11 days before she filed for divorce . He took her to court for not disclosing the money , and the judge awarded Rossi the entire haul . According to her lawyer Connolly Oyler , Denise could have kept half and perhaps all of her loot had she been honest , but the court ruled " her failure to disclose was a fraud , " he says . Since then Denise has disappeared ( she could not be located for comment ) , but not before trashing Rossi . " I was very happy to be free of this person that was like a parasite , " she told NBC 's Dateline in 2000 . " Winning the lottery has brought me really nothing but grief and headache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has given Rossi " peace of mind , " he says . " If it was n't for the lotto , Denise and I would probably still be together . Things worked out for the best . " William Post , 64 Won : $16.2 million Outcome : Brother hired a hit man to kill him , divorce , bankruptcy Gone are the days when William Post , 64 , would find a pair of pants he liked and buy 400 of them . Gone too are the mansion , the farm , the half-dozen cars and the diamonds . In fact , looking around Post 's ramshackle home in Franklin , Pa. , you 'd never suspect that 16 years ago he won $16.2 million . And yet despite declaring bankruptcy in 1994 and suffering from health problems including severe asthma , Post maintains , " I 'm a very happy man now . Money ca n't buy peace of mind . " As an overnight multimillionaire , that was certainly something that eluded the onetime circus cook . In 1994 his brother Jeffrey pleaded no contest to hiring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Connie , allegedly in order to get his hands on Post 's estate . ( Jeffrey is serving 20 years probation . ) Spooked by the plot , Connie left Post not long after . From there things deteriorated further , in large part because of Post 's lavish and sometimes bizarre spending sprees . " As soon as the stores opened he 'd want to go and buy stuff , " says his daughter Gladys Burrous , 42 . " Everything , anything . " Today Post lives on a $558 monthly Social Security disability check and has $43 in the bank . " He probably is happier , " says Burrous of her father . " When he won , he really did n't know how to handle it . " Author Affiliation By Pam Lambert and Alex Tresniowski .
