By discovering how stars shine , Hans Bethe became a 20th-century luminary. // The door to the modest apartment swings open and I am greeted by a trim , gracious woman whose bright eyes belie her age . This is Rose Bethe , Hans Bethe 's wife of 76 years . A moment later , Bethe himself appears . His eyes are a moist , pale blue and the few wisps of white hair surrounding his head frame an abundant smile . " Ah , good morning and welcome , " he says with a noticeable German accent . Rose guides us to a pair of chairs and there is a moment of settling in ( the man is 94 years old , after all ) . I tell him that I want to ask him some questions about his life and work , specifically his work on stellar fusion and supernovae . Before I can pull out my pad of prepared questions , Bethe starts his story . He begins , methodically , at the beginning . Immediately it 's dear that I should put my questions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am likely never to hear again . Hans Bethe ( pronounced BAY-tah ) is , without argument , one of the greatest physicists of the 20th century . He helped create modern atomic and nuclear science . He served as head of theory for the Manhattan Project . He is a man who has seen - and made - a lot of history . In astrophysics , Bethe 's most significant contribution was the theory of stellar energy generation . In essence , he figured out how stars shine . This may seem like a singular achievement , but it was only one of the numerous reasons he was awarded a Nobel Prize in Physics . Photograph Hans Bethe explained how lightweight atoms come together to generate the prodigious energy of massive stars . Photograph The hot , massive stars in NGC 3603 owe their luminosity to the CNO cycle . // Beginnings Bethe was born in Strasbourg ( then part of Germany ) in 1906 . It was a world awakening to new marvels such as radio , the airplane , radioactivity , and countless other discoveries and inventions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " As a boy I loved playing with numbers , " Bethe says with a smile . While his father was a physiologist , the biological sciences did not interest Hans . " I never even considered it , " he explains . " As I grew older I gradually turned to the physical sciences because I needed a place to apply the numbers I was playing with . " After beginning his university studies in math , he switched to physics and quickly finished his degree . The year was 1926 , and as University of Rochester physicist Robert Marshack once wrote , " Bethe 's timing was impeccable . " In the 1920s , the new field of quantum mechanics was starting to mature . This strange and highly mathematical theory was developed to describe the world of atoms and electrons . During the previous two decades , physicists such as Niels Bohr and Albert Einstein had struggled to make sense of experiments probing distances a billionth of a meter and smaller . The world behaves very differently at that level compared with what we experience directly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Uncertainty becomes a physical principle . Despite the intellectual vertigo , by the 1920s physicists Werner Heisenberg , Erwin Schrodinger , and others developed the conceptual tools needed to scrutinize the atomic world . Their quantum mechanics now stands as one of humanity 's greatest intellectual accomplishments . Bethe , who has been compared with a battleship for his single-minded determination in plowing though problems , stepped into the world of physics ready to take on the new tools of quantum mechanics . The Move to America " I worked in nuclear physics because of Hitler , " Bethe tells me as an introduction to his work on stellar fusion . After finishing his Ph.D. , Bethe wrote a number of insightful papers on the behavior of electrons in metals . The reputation he gained from this work soon proved invaluable . Bethe 's mother was Jewish . That made him a target of the Nazi 's growing political power . " The Germans were crazy , " he recalls . The Nazis were determined to keep Jews out of university positions , and by 1933 Bethe saw the writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a position at the University of Manchester . There he was reunited with Rudolf Peierls , an old friend and fellow German refugee scientist . Peierls convinced Bethe that applying quantum mechanics to the subatomic or " nuclear " realm was the next great frontier . In the early 1930s , physicists had only just recognized that the core of every atom was a dense knot of protons ( having positive electrical charge ) and neutrons ( which had no electrical charge ) . Nuclear physics was a discipline that combined the study of matter 's fundamental structure with a demand for deep mathematical insight . Bethe had found his love . Along with Peierls , he developed a theory of a simple nucleus , the deuteron - a form of hydrogen containing one proton and one neutron . Bethe 's work with Peierls was part of a lifetime of collaborative research . James Applegate , a Columbia University astrophysicist who worked with Bethe as a graduate student in the late 1970s , remembers his style . " When I started working with Bethe I was just this 23-year-old kid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment , Bethe took me seriously . All that mattered to him was the quality of ideas . " Applegate also recalls Bethe 's classic theoretical physicist sensibilities when it came to dealing with certain day-today realities . " Opening the milk cartons each day in the cafeteria used to give him a lot of problems , " says Applegate . " I hated seeing him wrestling so vehemently with the little boxes so I made it my responsibility to open them . " Based on the strength of his efforts with Peierls , Bethe was offered a faculty position at Cornell University . Given the turmoil in Europe , the move made sense . In February 1935 , Bethe landed in the United States , his rendezvous with the stars waiting just around the corner . Photograph Enrico Fermi ( left ) stands next to Bethe during some free time at Los Alamos in 1943. // Bethe 's arrival in the United States was part of a wave of European scientific emigration . The rise of Hitler 's regime sent many of the world 's best scientific minds across the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , D.C. , attending annual nuclear physics conferences alongside fellow European luminaries such as George Gamow and Edward Teller ( as well as their American counterparts ) . " It was at one of these meetings in 1938 that Teller and Gamow wanted to discuss nuclear physics and stars , " recalls Bethe . Amazing as it may seem , this man who was about to reveal the secrets of star power had never really given the problem much thought before the late 1930s . " Astronomy and physics were much more separated then compared to now , " says Bethe . " I knew some astronomers at Cornell , but we were miles away from each other in terms of our interests . I had not thought much about stars either as a child or as a young man . " Solving the Stars Bethe and his colleagues at the 1938 meeting were taking on one of humanity 's oldest questions : What makes stars shine ? At the time , science had progressed to the point where it could , at least , say what did n't make them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estimate Earth 's age at billions of years . Because the sun had to be as old as Earth , a simple calculation revealed that its abundant warmth and light could not be fueled by chemical burning , radioactive decay , or even gravitational contraction . These processes liberate energy too inefficiently to sustain the solar fire for so many eons . As quantum mechanics penetrated ever deeper into the heart of atomic phenomena , it became apparent that the nucleus was the place to search for a new kind of fuel . In the 1920s , the eminent British astrophysicist Sir Arthur Eddington argued that nuclear physics would solve the mystery of star power . But even Eddington could not explain how it happened . To educate themselves on problems of stellar energy generation , the Washington workshop organizers asked Swedish astronomer Bengt Stromgren to lecture on the current state-of-the-art in observational stellar astrophysics . As Bethe later wrote in his Nobel Prize lecture , " The astrophysicists told us physicists what they knew about the internal constitution of stars . This was quite a lot . " According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three key facts to deal with : First , stars are composed mainly of hydrogen , with smaller amounts of heavier elements . Second , the best estimate of the temperature at the sun 's core was 19 million kelvins . Third , massive stars shine much brighter than their low-mass cousins . Each fact was crucial for establishing a theory of how stars shine . The high temperatures were important because they allowed nuclear reactions to take place . Because atomic nuclei are made of protons and neutrons , the nuclei always hold positive charges . Getting them close enough to fuse requires overcoming their mutual electric repulsion . High temperatures translate into atomic nuclei moving at high velocity . If nuclei slam into one another hard enough , they can overcome the electric repulsion and fuse to form new , heavier elements . In a fusion reaction , some of the mass in the original nuclei is converted into energy ( via Einstein 's famous equation E = mcsup 2 ) . The reaction is a little like slamming four golf balls together to form a baseball , releasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in theory , power a star . Because hydrogen ( whose nucleus is a single proton ) was the most abundant element , it had to be the principal fusion fuel available to stars . German physicist Carl-Friedrich von Weizsacker had already imagined a chain of nuclear reactions using only hydrogen nuclei to power stars . By fusing four protons in a two-step process , von Weizsacker could produce energy to power the star and make helium , the next heavier element . Just before the conference , Bethe and von Weizsacker 's student , Charles Critchfield , also studied this " proton-proton " chain . The work was promising , but the reactions were too slow and inefficient to power the luminous high-mass stars . As the conference closed , it was clear there had to be more to the story . Bethe mulled over the problem during the long train ride home to upstate New York . There were many possible chain reactions using different combinations of elements , but which ones did nature choose ? Bethe now approached the issue of stellar nuclear fusion with the meticulous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the periodic table of elements , he examined each element in detail , asking if it could be an efficient actor in a chain reaction . " Some of the elements were unstable , some were too rare , " he recounts . " I just kept going up to heavier nuclei examining all the possibilities . " Photograph Hans Bethe meets with President John F. Kennedy in the early 1960s. // Element number six , carbon , gave him what he needed . Using this stellar trace element , together with nitrogen and oxygen , Bethe was able to map out a complicated six-step cycle . Bethe 's carbon-nitrogen-oxygen ( CNO ) chain of reactions took four protons and two electrons and , after a series of intermediate steps , turned them into a single helium nucleus . The pre-existing heavier elements acted to catalyze the process , speeding the chain along and adding to its energy generation . Bethe found that his CNO cycle was incredibly sensitive to the temperature in the star 's core . Turn the temperature up just a bit and the energy output went through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard by the matter lying above them . Temperatures in these cores can be more than twice that in the sun . These higher temperatures were just what Bethe needed . With his newly discovered CNO cycle , Bethe had found a way to power even the most luminous and massive stars . On September 7 , 1938 , just a couple of months after the Washington conference , the journal Physical Review received a manuscript from Bethe entitled " Energy Production in Stars ! The paper was a tour de force , providing explicit details of all the important nuclear reactions as well as eliminating all others . Bethe also wanted to make sure the connection to astronomy was explicit . " I went to great lengths , " he says , " to connect the nuclear physics to what astronomers observe in stars . " Bethe 's ideas began to circulate , and soon he was invited to the Harvard College Observatory for a lecture and a chance to defend his theory . Henry Norris Russell , perhaps the most respected American astronomer of his time , heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend the lecture . " Russell came to my talk and asked some very embarrassing questions , " says Bethe ruefully . " My knowledge of astronomy was limited and some of these I could not answer . " Whatever fumbling Bethe made in his responses did not affect Russell 's ultimate opinion of the theory . " Russell became my prophet , " says Bethe , laughing . " He went around telling people , Bethe has solved the problem ! " ' While Bethe thought his CNO cycle could power all stars , astronomers now know that the pure proton-proton chain that he , von Weizsacker , and Critchfield worked out is the primary energy source for low-temperature stars , such as the sun . The CNO cycle powers only more massive , luminous stars . Despite this modern perspective , Bethe 's achievement stands as a high point in astrophysics . When the Nobel Prize committee gave the award to Bethe in 1967 for a lifetime of achievement , it singled out his work on stellar fusion for special attention . In 1938 , with the results still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Little did he know that his cherished nuclear physics would soon be called upon for a far more ominous purpose . The Bomb As Hitler 's armies advanced across Europe , many of the world 's greatest scientists recognized that a horrifying weapon lay at the heart of the atomic nucleus . While Bethe was working on fusion , other physicists were working on the reverse process : fission . In nuclear fission , a large atomic nucleus is split into smaller pieces , liberating vast amounts of energy . Photograph Bethe currently studies supernovae , such as 1987A , whose remnant appears here . // The possibility of a fission bomb had been suggested as early as the mid-1930s , but many scientists were skeptical . But in 1942 , Enrico Fermi built a small nuclear fission reactor at the University of Chicago . " After Fermi showed that fission reactions with uranium were possible , I believed a weapon could be built , " says Bethe . In 1942 Bethe received a call from University of California-Berkeley physicist Robert Oppenheimer , asking him to join a new , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the high desert of New Mexico , at a place called Los Alamos . The rest , of course , is history . Bethe became Director of the Theoretical Division at Los Alamos . He was one of the critical players in the development of the first atomic weapons . His work on the physics of shock waves allowed the project to construct high  --  explosive triggers that could activate the fission reactions and set off the bomb . In looking back on those years , Bethe feels that the work on the bomb was necessary and inevitable . Of the still controversial decision to drop the atomic weapons he helped build , Bethe has said , " I think it was necessary to drop one , but the second one could have easily been avoided . I think Japan would have capitulated anyway . " In the years that followed , Bethe would become a strong proponent for both arms control and peaceful uses of nuclear energy . When he speaks of the ban-the-bomb movement of the 1950s , he reflects , " Those people kept the issue out in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago , Bethe sent a letter to President Clinton arguing that in the post-Cold War world , no new creative research should be carried out on the design of further nuclear weapons . Photograph Bethe ( left ) and Boyce McDaniel ride bicycles inside the Cornell Electron Storage Ring . // Return to the Stars After the war , Bethe returned to his beloved Cornell University , where he could occasionally be seen taking his students out to movies . He continued working on the fundamental structure of nuclear matter , but in time found himself back among the stars . Beginning in 1979 , Bethe began studying another kind of explosion , the apocalyptic deaths of massive stars known as supernovae . When a giant star runs out of nuclear fuel , its gravity pulls it down upon itself . The star collapses in a matter of hours . As gas rushes in toward the center , matter is squeezed to densities so high a thimbleful would weigh more than a skyscraper . The core is packed so tight it becomes , in essence , a giant atomic nucleus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder to shoulder , no further compression is possible without the core imploding forever to become a black hole . If the star is not too massive , it will escape that fate . When the outer layers of the star fall onto the now ultra-hard nuclear core , they bounce back . A shock wave forms , turning infalling gas around and blowing the rest of the star apart . For Bethe , a man of deep experience with both nuclear physics and powerful blast waves , supernova studies fit like a glove . For the last 20 years , the field has become his own , and he has pushed relentlessly at its frontiers . " Hans has contributed significantly to our modern understanding of supernovae , " says University of California , Santa Cruz , astrophysicist Stan Woosley . Woosley notes important works by Bethe that focused on how supernova blast waves form and evolve . " He has written perhaps a dozen influential papers on supernovae , including estimations of the energy of Supernova 1987A , " says Woosley , himself a world expert in supernovae . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ supposed to be retired . Like a scientific Energizer bunny , Bethe just keeps going and going . Pushing 100 years old , he has published more fundamental papers in the last 20 years than many hot , young astrophysics professors . His undiminished creativity is one reason why Bethe inspires a kind of awe in many scientists . When I asked University of Illinois astronomer James Kaler , an expert on stars , for his thoughts on Bethe , he responded with poetry : " Hans Bethe needs neither introductions nor accolades , neither awards nor prizes . He has the best and brightest of all trophies : the sun , whose radiance he helped explain , his work equally bright and illuminating . " Heading Home After two hours of talking I fear I am taking too much of Bethe 's time and begin to wind down the interview . It may.be that I am the one getting tired ; he does n't seem winded in the least . We touch on a few more issues . Which work is he most proud of " My work on stellar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an old and profound question : ' What is the most compelling question facing physics ? He answers quickly , " Unifying the four known forces of gravity , electromagnetism , and the strong and weak forces at work in the nucleus . " Finally , when I ask him what he thinks of science as a whole and his role in it , he pauses for a long moment . " There are qualitative laws of physics out there in the world , " he begins . " The 300 years since Newton is a ridiculously small fraction of the 6,000 years of human history . The 6,000 years of recorded history is a ridiculously small fraction of the millions of years that the genus Homo has existed . And yet , here we are , the first to really understand the nature of those laws . I feel very fortunate to have been around at this moment in history . " Perhaps , however , it is our moment in history that has been lucky to have Bethe .
