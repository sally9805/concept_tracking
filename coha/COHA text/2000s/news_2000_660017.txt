<p> He arrived early this morning on the ferry from Brindisi , Italy , as the night faded and a pallid mist rose from the sea . As the Europa I dropped anchor and its tailgate opened with a thunder , Andon Kokthi 's mother stood on the pier shrouded , in a black dress , waiting for her son . He rolled down the ramp in a black station wagon . The mother opened the door and kissed her son 's coffin . Every morning , as the Albanian port city of Vlore awakens to the light of day , the sea returns its reckless sons . Those with well-maintained engines and quick hands materialize on the horizon and slice the surface of the sea in their high-powered speedboats . Those who make a mistake in their race across the black Adriatic Sea do n't return alive . Organized crime syndicates from China 's Fujian " snakeheads " to Nigerian prostitute traffickers to Iraqi blackmarketeers all rely on human-cargo carriers like Andon Kokthi to navigate this major smuggling route , a slender , 42-mile stretch of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1,000 people leave from this southern port every day , bound for Italy illegally . Once inside the borderless European Union , they can easily travel north to countries desperate for cheap labor . In the past two to three years , this stretch of the Adriatic has become the European equivalent of the Rio Grande on the US-Mexico border . <p> But Kokthi made a mistake two nights earlier . Near the shore of San Foca di Melendugno , off the Italian coast , he pushed a group of Kurdish refugees overboard . As he sped back into the open sea , he suddenly stared into a searchlight of the Guardia di Finanza , the Italian police force charged with stopping smuggling . He tried to escape and the two boats , speeding at an estimated 50 m.p.h. , collided . Now his photograph is posted on a wooden board on Vlore 's Independence Square , next to his death notice . And his comrades are whispering revenge . Andon Kokthi was only 32 , but already a respected " entrepreneur " in Vlore . Like a drug dealer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They watched in awe when he cruised the city streets in his stolen Mercedes , still flashing German license plates , and gunned his speedboat across the Adriatic Sea . They knew that this was the way he had made his fortune . They saw the haggard people sitting on the beach night after night , clutching their belongings wrapped in plastic bags , climbing into Kokthi 's boat as the sky blackened . Kokthi , the ferryman , had a job and the golden rings to prove it . Albania 's speedboat " entrepreneurs , " or skafisti , run their businesses strictly according to the rules of market economy , providing services where demand is high and competitors are weak - or part of the family . Vlore 's skafisti are major players in a global people-smuggling trade that is not yet as profitable as trafficking narcotics , but it has become the fastest-growing branch of organized crime . Worldwide revenues from immigrant smuggling now top more than $ 6 billion annually , according to the International Organization for Migration in Geneva . Thanks to the formation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtually disappeared . But the EU is also finding that , like the United States , it is having to reinforce its outside borders against the emergence of a highly skilled army of people smugglers . They operate from behind the facades of hotels , pizzerias , jewelry stores , and night clubs , arranging illegal journeys to any destination if the price is right . In Albania and Macedonia , Yugoslavia and the Czech Republic , Hungary and Romania , Poland and Turkey , Morocco and Tunisia , smugglers have set up offices along the most popular routes to wealthy European countries . Like travel agents , the people smugglers move clients around the globe , offering fares - economy , luxury , and family discounts - tailored to their customers ' means . And there 's no lack of paying clientele . In September , Italian security officials estimated that some 50,000 Chinese were in the Balkans waiting to be smuggled into Italy . Restrictive asylum and immigration laws adopted by many European countries in recent years have created a new market for immigrant smugglers , and dictators like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a constant flow of customers . Nearly 300,000 illegal immigrants crossed the borders into the European Union last year , according to estimates by the International Centre for Migration Policy Development in Vienna , and more than half of them were guided by professional smugglers . Every night , somewhere a truck is rumbling on a street in the Czech Republic , a train is running between Bucharest and Prague , a speedboat is racing across the Adriatic Sea . <p> * * * The sea will be kind tonight . In the Bay of Vlore , a calm wind is stroking the water 's smooth and silver surface . Five speedboats , recognizable in the moonlight by their mighty outboard engines , are gently rocking near the shore . The skippers , hunched over the engines , complete last-minute repairs , the cigarettes dangling from their lips glowing with each pull . They wait for tonight 's passengers . A van stops on the beach . Two men open the backdoors and start carrying gasoline cans to a small wooden boat . They row out to the pontoon speedboats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ operation . A group of young men is sitting cross-legged on the beach . They look gaunt , shipwrecked even before they have boarded the boats . A lone woman is rocking a baby in her arms . She is wearing a T-shirt adorned with palm trees and a red sun rising over a place called " Haway . " They stare at the sea , waiting for a signal to get ready for the most dangerous leg of their journey . It will be a cold , grueling ride . Salty water will rain on them and the winds will chill them to the bone . Their spines will be pounded as the gommoni violently hit the surface of the sea at speeds of up to 70 m.p.h . Some of them may fall or be pushed overboard ; they will be left to drown . Anastas Goga , the supervisor of Vlore 's harbor , is standing on the platform outside his office , looking through binoculars . He is counting the people on the beach . It is all he can do for them - radio the rescuers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capsizes . He ca n't stop the smugglers ; he does n't even have a boat to follow them . And Mr. Goga knows that if he interferes with their business , the repercussions could be deadly . He has a wife and children . " This is Albania , " Goga says bitterly , observing the scene unfolding before his eyes . " This is how things work here . " The smugglers ' bosses arrive . A procession of dark Mercedes cars moves slowly along the beach and stops in front of the men and the woman sitting in the sand . The drivers get out , and immediately they are surrounded by their customers . Some pull bundles of dollar bills out of their plastic bags . The fare for Albanians is $ 600 , with a $ 100 discount for those who have been recommended to the smugglers by friends or family . The Kurdish refugees among the group have already paid $ 6,000 upon their arrival in Istanbul , Turkey , where they received fake passports and a guarantee to be transported to various destinations in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistle . The passengers grab their plastic bags in which they carry a set of proper clothes . They will put them on once they have reached the Italian shore , hoping not to be recognized as illegal immigrants . Most will be met by an Italian smuggling organization . Now the first group climbs into a speedboat . Sixteen men and one woman holding a baby board a boat designed to carry a maximum of six passengers . The baby cries . The skipper starts the engine and steers full speed into the open sea . Within moments the boat vanishes in the darkness , leaving a silvery tail shimmering on the surface of the sea . " God bless them , " Goga says as he watches the boat disappear . " They are putting their lives in the hands of teenagers . " Many of the skippers are indeed still in their teens . The owners of the boats prefer them to be so young ; the boys will take greater risks to escape the Italian police patrols . Sometimes the skippers push passengers overboard in order to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rescue passengers first . The Italian police have changed their strategy accordingly ; they now wait for the smugglers to drop their passengers on or near the Italian shore before they give chase . The smugglers in turn have responded by purposely trying to collide with police boats , hoping they will back off . For Andon Kokthi it was a gamble that proved deadly . *Tomrrow : Profile of an Albanian smuggler <p> ( c ) Copyright 2000 . The Christian Science Publishing Society
