Headnote When you 're chatting or e-mailinq , you can never be too sure just who your " friends " are . But get this - it 's not only the bad guys who are finding out who you are . David and Nikki had never met , but for weeks the teens had been e-mailing , talking about family , friends , school , video games and movies . Nikki , 16 , had invited David , 14 , to join her MySpace friends . She was new to his Florida neighborhood and was looking to make new friends . After weeks of e-mails and instant messages , David and Nikki planned to meet at a park after school one day last May . But when Nikki said she was nervous about meeting someone she did n't know , she asked David if he would meet her brother Shawn instead , and Shawn would bring David to her home . The next day , as Shawn drove David to meet Nikki , he stopped at a motel , he said , to drop off a camera to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ David learned the terrible truth . There was no Nikki . Shawn was really 27-year-old Travus Belden , who pretended online to be Nikki so he could lure David to the motel . Suddenly , David was in a struggle for his life . Detective Camille Burban of the Neptune Beach Police Department said Travus created Nikki 's MySpace Web page by copying and pasting photographs of an attractive girl he had found on the Internet . He admitted to police that he made up Nikki so he could meet teenage boys . David was n't his only victim . You Never Know Who 's Watching Most young people know the rules about safety on the Internet : Do not give out your full name . Do not give out your address or phone number . Do not tell people where you go to school , where you play sports , where you work or information about your family and friends . Do n't talk to anyone you do n't know . But a quick scroll through MySpace reveals that many teens disregard those rules . " Kids always think nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania Attorney General Tom Corbett , the state 's top cop . " But we know through our investigations that predators are looking at places like MySpace and Xanga to find potential victims . " And it 's not just predators who are visiting those Web sites . " Almost every major employer is using Facebook or MySpace . And if they are n't , they are contemplating how they are going to use them , " says Trudy Steinfeld , executive director of New York University 's Wasserman Center for Career Development , which helps match students with potential employers . " Employers may not admit it-but they are , " she said . In fact , many companies have their own MySpace and Facebook profiles to recruit and talk with job candidates . Know It : Nothing Is Private But , just as they use those Web sites to find employees , they can use them to eliminate candidates whose Web pages or blogs contain questionable content or photographs . " Young people think , " Well , it 's on MySpace or Facebook so it 's personal and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public domain , " Steinfeld says . " Everything you put on a Web site can and will be used . If you are applying for college or looking for work , do n't count that people wo n't be going to these Web sites to look for information about you . " Ana Homayoun agrees . Employers or universities might visit your Web site with good intentions but rule you out because of the site 's inappropriate content . As an educational consultant in California , she was traveling to Duke University to talk with a student she was thinking about hiring . She and the student had been e-mailing , and Homayoun was impressed with her resume and experience . Because they were meeting at a busy coffee shop , Homayoun went to the student 's Facebook page to see her picture . " I just wanted to know what she looked like , so I 'd know her when I saw her , " Homayoun says . " I was n't there to do a background check . " What she found on the student 's profile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had testimonials from friends of things she 's done while drunk , she talked about her sexual escapades , " Homayoun says . " What she put out there was a reflection of her judgment and decision-making skills . " Homayoun hired someone else and now offers simple advice : " When you put something on the Internet , if you would feel uncomfortable with your parents , your grandparents , your teachers or your future employers seeing it , then it probably should n't be there . " Cops Online There 's a new audience using the Internet nowadays-law enforcement officers . Police are venturing onto the Web to solve crimes-especially since so many people are bragging about their crimes or posting photographs of criminal behavior . Four students at Northern Kentucky University were fined for posting pictures of a drinking party on Facebook . The pictures , taken in a college dormitory , proved that the students were violating the school 's no-drinking policy . A student at Evergreen High School in Colorado was arrested by police after he posted pictures of himself with handguns and threatening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at TeWinkle Middle School was expelled after he threatened to kill another student from the school . Twenty of his friends were suspended from the school for visiting his Web site . " There 's a gang of kids in Harrisburg ( Pa. ) who post videos on YouTube where they talk about targeting police , disrespecting police , " says Corbett , the attorney general . " You better believe we are watching that stuff . " It 's Hard to Hide David 's story with Nikki/Travus is not unique , Corbett says . Once , to illustrate to a television reporter how easily predators are able to lure kids , one of Corbett 's agents began e-mailing with a teenage girl who was randomly selected from a MySpace page . Neither the agent nor the girl knew each other . Within a half hour , the agent had learned her last name , where she lived , where she went to school , the field hockey team she played on and even her game schedule , Corbett says . Then , using Mapquest , a Web site that maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could find his way to the girl 's home . " When you e-mail with someone you do n't know , how do you know the person you are talking to is n't lying to you ? You do n't , " Corbett says . " The Internet is a wonderful thing for young people , but they have to learn how to use it safely . " That 's a lesson David learned the hard way . But there 's a happy ending to his story . During his struggle with Travus , David was able to break free , get out of the motel room and run to a nearby restaurant . The Neptune Beach police arrested Travus for the crime , and he was sentenced to two years in prison . Sidebar WHAT WOULD GRANDMA SAY ? Sidebar RULES FOR SAFE SURFING Be anonymous .

Sidebar YOU CAN TAKE ACTION Ted Roman , 18 , an Eagle Scout from Pennsylvania , keeps a " clean " MySpace Web site : no inappropriate words , pictures , videos or music . But sometimes , his friends ' sites are a different story . " I had one friend who posted a picture of his speedometer at 120 miles per hour that was taken while the car was going that fast , " Ted says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself posing with a bottle of liquor . So what do you do when your friends say or post inappropriate things online ? Police Chief Michael Bookser of the Bellevue ( Pa . ) Police Department , who teaches Internet safety , offers this advice : " We all do stupid things , " he says . " If your friend 's actions are foolish-but not necessarily criminal-then talk with your friend about why the words or pictures should n't be there . Remind your friend that nothing is private on the Internet-and nothing is temporary . Just because a picture or content is removed from one Web page does n't mean it has n't already been viewed , copied and posted somewhere else . " Second , if the words , photographs or videos are serious enough to scare you or to land your friend in trouble at school or with police , immediately tell an adult whom you trust . That might be your parents , a coach , your school 's DARE officer , a teacher .
