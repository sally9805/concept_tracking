<p> In the last two years , as the Bay Area 's boom gave way to the region 's worst crash since the Great Depression , 285,000 jobs disappeared from the local economy . <p> One of those once belonged to Bill Barnes , a 55-year-old machinist who 's lived his whole life in Redwood City . His story of moving from security to near destitution tells volumes about the human toll of the region 's fall to Earth . <p> Until 2001 , Barnes was earning decent pay and working 50-hour weeks making parts for electronic equipment , surgical lasers and trucks . <p> Now , nearly two years after he was laid off , Barnes is about to receive his last $330 weekly unemployment check . He owes about $12,000 on his credit cards and has maybe $100 in the bank . He figures he can pay the rent on his one-room apartment through April 15 . After that , he does n't know what he will do . <p> Almost every day , Barnes works the phones and knocks on doors in search of work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's worried . But he still expects things will turn out for the best . " I 've learned to have faith and have hope that something will come up , " he said . <p> Barnes ' predicament reflects the seismic economic shifts that are shaking up lives throughout the Bay Area . The national recession has hit the region as hard as any place in America . Silicon Valley is stuck in a two-year depression , airlines are laying off blue-collar and white-collar workers , and hotels and restaurants have slashed their workforces . <p> Across the country , no sector of the economy has been hurt more than manufacturing . In San Mateo County , where Barnes lives , 10,700 factory jobs have disappeared , an 18 percent drop , in two years . <p> With no upturn yet in sight , many workers find themselves on the edge of an abyss . Unable to find jobs , they are draining bank accounts and exhausting unemployment benefits . <p> PERSONAL STORY <p> Barnes " is one of thousands of working-class people who are running out of unemployment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rayna Lehman , director of community services for the San Mateo County Central Labor Council . " We 've got lots of folks like him . " <p> But Barnes ' struggle to keep his head above water is also deeply personal , carrying the imprint of the difficult , zigzag path he has taken through life . For him , bringing home a paycheck , paying the rent and putting food on the table are never things to take for granted . <p> During most of his adult life , he was addicted to heroin . When he worked , the money went to cop dope . He hustled , he stole and he dealt . Seven times he was sent to prison , including three terms in San Quentin . His 10-year marriage busted up over drugs and his frequent sojourns behind bars . <p> Nine years ago , shortly after his father died , he decided to enter a 12-step recovery program . He moved to Moriah House , a Menlo Park residential program for treating drug and alcohol addiction . <p> " It was December 1993 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening in San Mateo when I was delivering drugs , " Barnes recalled . " I had an outstanding warrant in Santa Clara County and a new charge of driving under the influence of drugs . " <p> " I had 2.5 grams of heroin in a sandwich bag underneath the front seat . It was another miracle in my life . They did n't find these drugs . But I was running out of miracles . I needed to do something . " <p> Barnes lived in Moriah House for a year and has been clean since . While undergoing treatment , he began working steadily . " It felt good to pay my own way . I never knew how to live like that , " he said . <p> As an addict , always worrying about the next fix , Barnes was edgy , foul-tempered and vaguely dangerous . When he had a job , co-workers steered clear of him . But after he cleaned up , it was as if a whole new personality emerged . <p> " I really liked Bill Barnes , I really did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ House and later changed its name to Recovery Concepts . Barnes volunteered there after completing treatment and worked briefly as a counselor and driver in 2001 until funding ran out . <p> " The first time I met him , I was impressed , " the 87-year-old Vandervoort said . " He was n't a loudmouth . He was quiet and reserved and very polite . He seemed to know things about drugs-and-alcohol people and how to help them . " <p> The main hint of an addict 's personality is a certain obsession with detail , an insistence on absolute precision . Barnes shows up early for appointments and peppers a reporter with phone calls to make sure that dates and places are correctly described and that proper recovery terminology is used . <p> Barnes lives in a small , immaculately kept studio on the third floor of a nondescript stucco apartment building by the railroad tracks in Redwood City , half a mile from his childhood home . He pays $875 a month for the space , after convincing the landlord to come down from $957 . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagles . In one corner is a 4-year-old Apple computer , the first line of offense in Barnes ' search for work . He shares the apartment with a 6-year-old cat given the name Refund by a former girlfriend . <p> Since his teens , Barnes has worked as a mechanic or a machine operator . As an addict , he usually managed to hold down jobs when he was n't doing time , though most of the money went to support his habit . <p> A GOOD JOB <p> After he quit heroin , Barnes worked at several machine shops on the Peninsula before taking a job at Redwood City 's Bennett Hopkins Corp . in 2000 . He moved to the family-owned company , which had opened in 1953 , because it offered health benefits and preferred cutting back employee hours to firing people when business slowed . <p> At Bennett Hopkins , Barnes operated computerized tools for cutting and shaping metal , an outstanding business when Silicon Valley was selling record volumes of hardware . He was earning $18 an hour and drawing plenty of overtime . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , " he recalled . " I expected to retire there . " <p> But Barnes had taken the job just as the technology boom was drawing to a close . Bennett Hopkins ' business began to plummet at the beginning of 2001 . In June , Barnes and three other workers were laid off . Six months later , the company was sold , the shop was closed and the machinery was moved to a facility in Newark . <p> " They were heavy into semiconductor equipment , and the business went away , " said a businessman familiar with the company . <p> After several months of collecting unemployment , Barnes managed to get a counseling job at Recovery Concepts at the end of 2001 , earning between $8 and $10 an hour . Barnes had put in thousands of hours of volunteer work at the facility since his treatment . As a volunteer , and later as a staff member , he won the respect of residents . <p> " He 's been there , he 's been to prison , he used for a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Vince Mitchell , one of the residents . " Just by his personality and kindness to fellow human beings and fellow suffering addicts , it ca n't help but make you feel good about yourself . " <p> By May 2002 , Recovery Concepts could no longer afford to keep Barnes on staff . <p> " He was reliable . He came to work every day when he said he was going to come in . You 'd ask him to do something and he 'd do it , " Vandervoort said . " I feel sorry we had to let him go . " <p> Barnes was eligible again for unemployment benefits . Meanwhile , he visited just about every machine shop on the Peninsula in his search for work . Factories were down to skeleton crews . What 's more , no one was employing operators unless they were also trained in programming and setup of computerized machines , skills Barnes lacked . <p> With scant demand for machinists , Barnes extended his search outside his field , using the resources of the state Employment Development Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the recovery community . <p> He 's applied unsuccessfully for county jobs and work as a groundskeeper at local schools . He recently filled out an application at a San Mateo pest control company despite what he described as an eerie feeling about crawling underneath houses looking for dead animals . <p> DAILY ROUTINE <p> Now time has just about run out for him . He still keeps to his routine  --  several hours each day on the computer looking at job listings or filling out applications , several hours on the street cold-calling potential employers or stopping at employment offices . <p> Every evening , he goes to a 12-step meeting . He 's graduated to what the recovery community calls service , meaning that he leads meetings or performs routine tasks , such as collecting money , making coffee or taking notes . Once a month , he goes to San Mateo County Jail to lead a meeting inside . <p> With little idea how he will feed and shelter himself , Barnes faces a situation that would reduce most people to desperation . That has n't happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to accept help from others . " I do n't want to be living on the street , " he stressed . But he has faith things will work out . <p> He tells a story of something that happened in the 1970s . To get drug money , he stole cars and stripped them for parts . Once he was racing a stolen Porsche on Skyline Drive when he skidded off the road at 75 mph . He remembers going through the trees backward , thinking his life was over . Instead , he landed without a scratch . <p> " God works miracles in my life , but sometimes he does n't do it until the last minute , " he said . " There is something that is going to happen , but I do n't know what it is . Everything comes in God 's time , not mine . I just have to do the footwork . " E-mail Sam Zuckerman at **26;27;TOOLONG
