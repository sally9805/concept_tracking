One hour . Just give it one hour , I told myself . That 's the advice I give my organizing clients when clutter overwhelms them . Break up the large jobs into smaller tasks . It 's what I told Livvy when her attempts to write her name nearly drove her to tears . One letter at a time . One chunk of clutter at a time . <p> Of course it 's easier to give advice than to follow it yourself , I decided as I folded the flaps back on a box that contained our tax returns from the last five years . It was the same box I 'd opened almost an hour ago , but life , in the form of dirty diapers , lost socks , and a spider in the bathroom sink had whittled away at my time . <p> Mitch stuck his head around the door frame of the spare bedroom and said , " Wow , does n't look like you 've gotten much done . " <p> His tone was matter-of-fact , but I was aggravated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and decided we were in denial . The bed frame and mattresses were propped against the wall so we could fit stacks of boxes into the rest of the space . " This is n't a spare bedroom . This is a storage room . " <p> " There 's nothing wrong with having a storage room , " Mitch said in the same reasonable tone . <p> " There is if you 're a professional organizer . I should have had these boxes unpacked months ago . We 've lived here for ten months . I always unpack all our boxes right away . " <p> " It 's a well-known fact that professional organizers who have a three-year-old and a toddler get an exemption from perfection . Let 's tackle it this weekend . I 'll help . " <p> " No . That 's okay , " I said quickly . " I 'll try to get in another hour tomorrow . " It was sweet of him to offer , but if I let Mitch unpack these boxes I 'd probably never find the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an open space . They could end up under a bed or in the laundry room . I clambered over two boxes to get to the door . " Sorry I 'm so crabby , but knowing we have all this stuff crammed in here is like an annoying gnat that keeps buzzing around my head . " <p> " You 'll get it done , " Mitch said , and rubbed the back of my neck as we walked down the hall . " How about a relaxing game of Galaga after we get the kids in bed ? " <p> I 'd found a game system with Mitch 's favorite classic arcade games for his birthday . " Yeah , that 'll help , " I said dryly . I had to be the worst player ever . " Let me get in a walk first before it gets dark . " <p> " Great idea . I 'll get the stroller . " Mitch had already gone for his run , but he was always up for any type of workout . <p> " No , I meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I had time to check them . <p> " Oh . " I could tell from his subdued tone that I 'd hurt his feelings . <p> " Mitch , I 'm sorry , but I need some time alone . " <p> He leaned back on his side of the hall and crossed his arms . " Why do n't you want to spend time together , just us ? Every night , it 's like you ca n't wait to sprint out the door for your walk . You 're already by yourself all day . " <p> I gaped at him . " How can you say that ? " I usually get tongue-tied when I 'm in a heated discussion , but not this time . " No , I 'm not . I have two kids and a dog with me all the time . That 's not being alone . " I braced myself on the other side of the hall . " While you 're talking to adults , going to lunch with the guys , and working out , I 'm making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I load and unload that dishwasher so much I feel like I run a restaurant and I know every word to ' There 's a Hole in My Bucket , ' which has to be the most annoying song in the world . " <p> I blew out a breath , trying to calm down . I hated it when we argued . " Look , I want some couple time for us , too , but I feel like I 'm being pulled in a million directions . The kids are so ... labor-intensive right now . A twenty-minute walk is a sanity break . " <p> " My job is n't all fun and games either , " he said quietly . Mitch never raised his voice . He just got quieter and more still . <p> " I know that . I know being in the squadron is stressful , too . " How could I explain ? " Imagine if you never left the squadron . You were always at work . That 's how it is for me . " <p> Arms extended straight in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pillowcase I 'd pinned to her shoulders flapping out behind her . " I 'm Super Livvy , " she shouted . Nathan " cruised " behind her , stumbling along on his pudgy legs as he transferred his grip from one piece of furniture to another to help him keep his balance . He gripped my knees for a second as he passed , then inched his way down the hall with one hand on the wall . <p> We stared at each other for a few seconds ; then Mitch cracked a small smile . " Reminds me of my office . ' There 's a Hole in My Bucket , ' huh ? " <p> My shoulders relaxed and I smiled , too . " As sung by Goofy , but do n't say it too loud or Livvy will break into song . " <p> Mitch stepped away from the wall . " You go on . I 'll get Super Livvy and her sidekick in their pajamas . " <p> I slid my arm around his waist and kissed him . " Thanks . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remote code to close the garage door and then let out the leash as Rex ran down our long driveway . He 'd been waiting for me at the door , ears perked and an air of barely suppressed expectation nearly vibrating off him . With two weeks of almost constant rain , his walks had been severely curtailed . I rotated my shoulders and tried to put our spat out of my mind and enjoy being outdoors . <p> It was still slightly muggy , but the humidity was so much lower than it had been during the summer . After our move to Georgia in January , we 'd enjoyed two months of ideal weather and I now understood snowbirds . A winter without snow tires was such a welcome break after our last assignment in Washington State , where it would already be cold by now and there might possibly be snow . Here in middle Georgia , the only signs of fall were pumpkins dotting the wide porches . Even though we were barely halfway down the block , a fine layer of sweat beaded my hairline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> I wondered what my old neighbors , Mabel and Ed Parsons , would think of our new neighborhood . We 'd gone from an arts and crafts bungalow that could verifiably be called an antique to a house built three years ago . Only one occupant before us . We had all the bells and whistles now : remote garage door opener , garbage disposal , security system , and those clever windows that fold down inside so you can clean the outside of them without leaving the house . Although I did n't see much window cleaning in my immediate future . In fact , my days seem to consist only of keeping the basic necessities of our life clean : the clothes , the dishes , and ( sometimes ) the house . <p> Our new subdivision , Magnolia Estates , certainly lived up to its name with magnolia trees dotting almost every yard . Tonight , the scent of jasmine hung in the still air . Set back from the road , new brick houses in a traditional style kept up the southern theme : rooflines soared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had white rocking chairs on their porches . <p> I paced down the street as it curved around the edge of a large drainage pond to the end of the street . A silver Cadillac coasted to a stop at the curb behind me and Coleman May leveraged himself out of the car . As always , he wore a golf shirt-today 's was yellow-and khaki pants . A visor shaded his eyes , but left his mostly bald head bare to the sun . Surely his few stands of comb-over hair did n't protect his head from sunburn during all the hours he spent on the course ? <p> He popped the trunk and pulled out a black garbage bag . " Evenin ' , " he said as he tore a garage sale sign from the corner light post and crumpled it , then picked up some litter . <p> " Mr. May , " I said , and reeled the leash in , then bent to help him with the bright flyers and posters that clogged near the drain . The rains had softened the paper and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see this light post from your house ? " he asked . <p> " I suppose so . " <p> " If you see anyone putting up signs , flyers , or posters , give me a call . I 'll come down and take care of it . The only one who 's authorized to put anything up is Gerald Lockworth , " Coleman said as I picked up a flimsy water-soaked paper . " He 's filled out the permit with the homeowners ' association . " Even though it was smeared , I recognized the flyer . <p> It looked like hundreds of other flyers taped in business windows all over North Dawkins . FIND JODI read the bold letters above the picture of a smiling young woman in her twenties . Straight blond hair framed a pretty face . Her smile was wide and showed her even , white teeth . It was hard to reconcile the open face with the word below the picture , MISSING . <p> I was n't about to become the neighborhood tattletale , so I said , " You know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy with my kids . " <p> " You should notice . It 's everyone 's responsibility to maintain the standards of Magnolia Estates . " <p> It sounded like a line from the monthly homeowners ' association newsletter that Coleman wrote and delivered each month in his role as HOA president . It probably was a line from the newsletter , but I could n't really say for sure , since I never read the thing . For all I knew , Mitch and I were in violation of several obscure HOA regulations . <p> Coleman said , " I 've made a special exception for Gerald because Jodi lived here . " <p> I looked at the blurry photograph again before I put it in the trash bag . " Really ? " <p> " You did n't know that ? " He yanked the ties on the trash bag closed , then held it against the bulge of his potbelly . His gaze flickered to my house again and I had the feeling he was about to say more , but stopped himself . <p> " How long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He put the trash bag in his trunk and walked around to the driver 's door . " Let 's see , it was right about the first of the year , so that would be around ten months . Keep an eye out for those illegal flyers , " he called before he shut his door and drove away . <p> Rex pulled on the leash . I turned and followed the street 's blacktop , which extended a few feet . Then the road switched to a gravel track that had been an entrance for the construction crews during the building of the first phase of Magnolia Estates . It would eventually be paved and lined with homes , but now between building phases the road was quiet and used mostly as a jogging and walking path . <p> I let Rex off the leash and he hurtled down the path . The missing woman , Jodi , had lived in Magnolia Estates . How weird was that ? I 'd seen her picture around town , but knowing that she lived here , drove the same streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strange , eerie feeling . I picked up my pace . <p> A few scraggly rays of sun angled through the dense growth of trees , bushes , and vines . The path was the only swath of openness . The thick foliage made me feel like I was miles from civilization , but I reminded myself that the path curved around the far side of the pond , then ran parallel to our street , creating a perfect walking loop . <p> I looked up . Directly overhead , a strip of sky was still light blue with one tiny paisley-shaped cloud tinged pink . I took a deep breath and drank in the beauty of the blush-colored cloud . <p> I noticed Rex had n't trotted back to me in a while . I called him , but the gloomy path was empty . I jogged to the bend in the path and called again . I saw a flicker of dark movement up on the left . I hurried over . " Rex , come down . " He was nosing around the small cemetery plot that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Rex , " I said in my me and I clipped the leash back on him . I glanced back up at the cemetery , thinking that it was slightly odd that the place did n't creep me out . I 'd walked past it for weeks without seeing it since it was higher than the path and the black wrought-iron that had once enclosed the rectangle of land now tilted at a crazy angle and trailed a skirt of kudzu that camouflaged it . <p> I had noticed it one day when I spotted a pale yellow stone marker , an obelisk , poking through the curtain of leaves and bushes . I 'd taken a few steps up the embankment and stopped there to study the worn markers . No poison ivy for me , thank you . It had n't made me feel the least bit scared , only a little sad to see the graves so abandoned . <p> Rex pulled on the leash , ready to move on , but I paused , frowning . " Now , that 's not right , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a white Halloween mask , a skull . It sat under a bush outside the kudzu-draped fence , contrasting sharply against the dirt and dark leaves . <p> " Kids , " I muttered as I climbed two steps up the embankment and angled my foot to kick the mask clear of the greenery . It looked like the Halloween pranks were starting early this year . <p> I hesitated and leaned down . It looked so realistic . <p> Correction . Not realistic . Real . <p> Chapter Two Even though I 've watched those TV forensic shows and seen bones and human remains in all their grisliness recreated on the small screen , nothing had prepared me for the real thing . I think that was what freaked me out the most . I knew the skull was real . I did n't have to touch it or move it to understand that . I just knew . <p> I stepped back and slipped . My arm splatted down into the soft mud . Thankfully , I did n't land on the skull , since I 'd stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eye-level with it either . I righted myself , holding my left arm away from my body . <p> All I could think of was the bleary picture of the missing woman . I swallowed and looked at the skull . Was that Jodi ? My heartbeat ramped up . <p> I wanted to sprint away , but my jerky movements made my feet skid again . I had n't noticed on my quick climb up the embankment that the earth was still soaked from the rain , but now , as I took a few deep breaths to calm down , my feet shifted slightly in the sludgy earth . My heart hammered like it did when I actually got around to doing my kickboxing video . <p> My gaze followed the trail of mud that had cascaded down from the cemetery . Rex 's paw prints dotted the mud slide . At the top , I could see a piece of the kudzu-covered wrought-iron fence that had surrounded the plot of land , broken away and dangling . A few kudzu vines threaded through the piece of fence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down with the rest of the mud . <p> The back corner of the cemetery plot had sheered away , leaving a casket exposed . Its sides had collapsed , creating a gaping darkness under the lid that had tumbled sideways and was wedged in the earth , half covering the other pieces of the casket . <p> I thought I saw another skull-like shape . <p> Surely not . In the fading light it was hard to make out the details in the mix of dark mud and shadows , but it did look like another one , another skull . I squinted , then forced myself to take one more step up the embankment . As much as I did n't want to believe what I was seeing , I had to admit that even to my untrained eye , it was another skull . It was half buried in the mud near the splayed casket , but the curved dome of the skull and the empty eye sockets were impossible to mistake . <p> I stayed as clear of the mud slide as I could and picked my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the back of the cemetery . I did n't realize that Rex had been trotting along beside me until he rubbed against my leg . I transferred the leash to my muddy left hand and rubbed his head as I studied the cemetery . The rest of it was intact and undamaged . Well , undamaged was probably not a good word choice . The rest of the cemetery looked the same as it always did , abandoned and disheveled . There were no more exposed graves . I looked back at the two skulls and got that ice-cube-down-the-spine feeling . One of them could be her . I stood on the rise , considering what I should do . Call 911 was the obvious answer , but I did n't have my phone with me . <p> I looked up and down the path . I could n't see back around the bend , the direction I 'd come , but I could see several feet down the path in the direction I 'd been walking . Not a soul in sight . It was late . The color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The cloud was now tangerine and the darkness around the trees was thicker . I doubted anyone else would walk this path again until tomorrow morning . I did my best to shake the uneasy feeling . <p> I carefully sidestepped down the embankment , going out of my way to avoid going too near the washed-out portion of earth . I went slower on the way down . I did n't want to get any muddier than I already was . Once back on the path , I thought about cutting through the trees . It would be the quickest way since I was past the pond . The path mirrored our street , and our house was directly above the curve in the road . I could cut through and go in our back gate . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
