Tuesday , July 5 , 8:58 a.m . Someone had driven a tire iron into my skull . I could tell , because centered in my left temple was a vast throbbing pain that could only come from desperate injury . It felt like there were a thousand vicious gnomes leaping up and down on the iron , trying to increase the size of the hole in my head . I had the idea that once it was split open far enough , they would run down the length of metal and dive into the soft , gooey gray matter of my brain and have themselves a little gnomish pool party . Neither of my eyes would open . I fumbled a hand up to poke at them and encountered sufficient goo that I took a moment to consider the possibility that the gnomes were already in my head , had overfilled it and were now flowing out my sinuses and tear ducts . It was n't a pretty thought . Then again , nothing could be a pretty thought when someone 'd smashed a tire iron into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to work some of the ook out of them . My heart was beating like a rabbit on speed , except when it paused with an alarming little arrhythmia that made me start hyperventilating . I hoped I was dying , because anything else seemed anticlimactic with all that going on . Besides , I had some experience with dying . It was kind of old hat , and so far it had n't stuck . Unlike my eyes . I physicallypried one open with my fingers . The red numbers on my alarm clock jumped into it and stabbed it with white-hot pokers . I whimpered and let it close again , wondering why the hell I was in my bed , if I was dying . Usually I found myself dying in more exotic locations , like diners or city parks . A whisper of memory drifted through my brain in search of something to attach itself to . The department 's Fourth of July picnic had been the day before . I 'd attended , feeling saucy and cute in a pair of jeans shorts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half . Cute and I are not generally on speaking terms , so the feeling had been a novel one and I 'd been enjoying it . The outfit had shown off a rare tan and the fact that I 'd lost twelve pounds in the past few months , and I 'd gotten several compliments . Those were as rare as me rubbing elbows with cute , so it 'd been a good day . Which did nothing to explain how it had ended with a tire iron separating the bones of my cranium . I walked my fingers over the left side of my head , cautiously . My fingers encountered hair too short to be tangled , but no tools of a mechanic 's trade . I pressed my hand against my temple , admiring how nice and cool it felt against the splitting headache , and the memory found something to attach itself to . Morrison . My boss . Smiling fatuously down at a petite redhead in Daisy Mae shorts that hugged her va-va-va-voomit 'd sounded like an awfully good idea . I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd never gotten them open , so I only wrinkled them and felt crusty goo crinkle around my lashes . The only other thing I remember clearly was a bunch of guys from the shop swooping down on me as they-each- bore a fifth of Johnnie Walker . With my last name being Walker , they figured me and Johnnie must be cousins and that gave me a leg up on them . I was pretty sure my leg up had turned into a slide down the slow painful descent of hangover hell . I gave up on rubbing my eyes and prodding my head , and instead flopped my arm out to the side with a heartfelt grunt . Unfortunately , the grunt was n't mine . It turned out my eyes were willing to come open after all , with sufficient force behind the attempt . I was n't sure I had eyelashes left after the agony of ripping through loaded-up sleep , but at least the subsequent tears did something to wash away some of the goop . I was out of bed and halfway across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the deadly weapon it was n't , when I noticed I was n't wearing any clothes . Neither was the blurry-eyed guy who 'd grunted when I 'd smacked him . At least not on his upper half . He pushed up on his elbows while I scrubbed at my eyes with my free hand . I 'd gone to sleep with my contacts in , which partly explained why there was such a lot of gunk in my lashes , but I did n't believe what my twenty-twenty vision was telling me . I was pretty certain the goo had to be impairing it somehow , because -- because damn , sister ! " Easy on the eyes " did n't cover it . He was so easy on the eyes that they just sort of rolled right off him as precursor to a girl turning into a puddle of-All right , there was way too much goo going on in my morning . " Who the hell are you ? " I demanded , then coughed . I sounded like I 'd been on a three-day drunk . In my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-night drunk , but Jesus . " Mark , " he said in a sleepy , good-natured sort of rumble , and grinned at me . " Who 're you ? " " What 're you doing here ? " I asked instead of answering . He arched one eyebrow and looked my naked self over , then lifted the covers a few inches to inspect his own lower half . " I 'd say I 'm havin ' a real good night . " He grinned again and flopped back onto my bed , arms folded behind his head . His hair was this amazing color between blond and brown , not dishwater , but glimmering with shadows and streaks of light . His folded-back arms displayed smoothly muscular triceps . Who ever heard of someone having noticeably beautiful triceps , for heaven 's sake ? The puff of hair in his armpits was , at least , an ordinary brown and not waxed away . That would 've been more than I could handle . " So who 're you ? " he asked again , pleasantly . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cream , eaten the canary and then knocked the dog out of the sunbeam so he could loll in it undisturbed . For a moment I was tempted to open the curtains so I could see if he 'd stretch out and expose his belly to the morning sunlight . God should be so good as to give every woman such a view once in her life . The thing was-well , there were many things . Many , many things and all of them led back to me being unable to think of the last time I 'd done something so astoundingly stupid . No , that was n't true . I knew exactly the last time I 'd done something so astoundingly stupid . I 'd been fifteen , and I 'd have hoped the intervening thirteen years of experience would be enough to keep me from doing it again . Only I had n't been shitface drunk then , and if the God who was kind enough to provide the gorgeous man in my bed was genuinely kind , there would n't be the same consequences there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so far out of my league it was n't even funny . I did n't think I 'd said that out loud until he pushed up on an elbow again and looked me over a second time before saying , " I beg to differ , " in a mildly affronted tone . Then curiosity clearly got the better of him as he sat all the way up , drawing his knees up and looping his arms around them as he squinted at me . He had a tattoo on his right shoulder , a butterfly whose colors were so bright it had to be new . His biceps were magnificent . He had smooth sleek muscle where most people did n't even have flab . It was like he took up more space than he really ought to . Which , in my experience , suggested he probably was n't human . I did n't realize I 'd said that out loud , either , until he threw his head back and laughed , then scooted around on my bed like he belonged there , giving me a curious grin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I finally answered . " Joanne Walker . SPD , " I added faintly , for no evident reason . Maybe I thought announcing I worked for the police department would provide me with some kind of physical shielding . It struck me that clothes would be a lot more effective in that arena . Still clutching my slipper as a weapon , I scampered for the bathroom and pulled my rarely used robe off the door . " I 'm pleased to make your acquaintance , Joanne Walker , " he called after me . I stuck my head out the door incredulously . " Is that what you call it ? " " What should I call it ? " He shrugged , a beautiful movement like glass flowing . " I 'm gettin ' a kinda freaked-out vibe from you , ma'am . You want I should vacate the premises ? " " I want you should tell me you had rubbers in your wallet and you do n't anymore , and that you 've got a nice clean blood test in your hip pocket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I retreated into the bathroom again and poked through the garbage nervously . Funny what strikes a girl as relieving in the midst of mental crisis . Having a naked guy whose name I barely knew in my bed would normally be more than enough reason to come apart at the seams , but oh no . Give me a little evidence of safe sex despite drunken revelry and it seemed I could handle the naked guy . Pity there was no such evidence . Despite that , my hind brain announced it would n't half mind handling the naked guy . More than once . Which , in fact , I could only presume that I had . Augh . " Sorry , " he said . " Still got three in my wallet . " Three . I stopped poking around in the garbage to stare though the wall at him . " Confident , are n't you ? " I heard a grin come into his drawl : " Looks like I got cause , ma'am . I had five to begin with , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could stare at him more effectively . I 'd developed some unusual skills lately , but X-ray vision had n't been one of them . " Are you serious ? " " No , " he said , still cheerfully . " Sorry , ma'am . " Jesus . I did n't remember the last time I got laid , or more accurately , I remembered in exquisite , precise detail , and now it appeared I 'd missed an all-nighter of action thanks to way , way too much whiskey in the jar . That was wrong on so many levels I did n't even know where to begin . " Stop calling me ma'am . " For some reason I found the ma'aming kind of charming , and I was n't sure I wanted to be charmed . I was n't sure what I wanted at all . All my base impulses were to throw the guy out and hide under the bed until it all went away . It 'd been an approach to life that had worked pretty well until recently , but a couple of weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't going to cut it anymore . Violently was the key word : there were two people dead because I 'd refused to step up to the plate when I should have . So much as I wanted to take my slipper and drive Mitch out of my apartment with it , I kind of thought maybe I should do something adult and sensible , like own up to my great , huge , flaming mistake and try to cope . The tire iron reasserted its presence in my skull . I groaned and grabbed my head , trying to focus on a cool , silver-blue flutter of power that typically resided beneath my breastbone . A hangover , in a mechanic 's parlance , was essentially an overheated engine-dehydration in any form fit nicely into that analogy-and helping someone recover from dehydration was in my bag of tricks . I called on that power , for once selfishly glad to have access to it . Absolutely nothing happened . No , that was n't true . Reluctance happened , a feeling I 'd encountered once before , when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut had left a scar when being stabbed through the chest by a four foot sword had n't : my newlyawakened power 's way of announcing that it thought some things should be acknowledged and dealt with on a purely human level . Apparently hangovers fell into that category , too . I whimpered and dared peek at myself in the mirror while I got a glass of water and fumbled for aspirin . Aside from the sleepy eyes , I did n't look nearly as awful as I thought I should . In fact , between the tan , the mussy hair and what could reasonably be called a rosy , satisfied glow , I actually looked sort of hot . As in sexy , not overheated , the latter of which being how I 'd normally use the word . The robe was even this nice soft mossy green that played up the hazel in my eyes . Mitch or Matt or Mark or whatever the hell his name was , appeared in the reflection behind me . He 'd put his jeans on and left the top buttons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked . My eyes just sort of slid right down his torso and fixated at that little flat bit of belly before more interesting things got started .
