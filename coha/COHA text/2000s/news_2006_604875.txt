<p> NEW YORK  --  Natalie Portman is having a big hair day . The wavy tresses she shaved to play strong-willed Evey in the political action drama V for Vendetta are growing out in cute , sprightly curls that frame her oval face . Portman calls her low-maintenance new ' do " pretty fun . " <p> " I have someone who does it up for me on these occasions , " she says with a giggle . <p> Portman had her locks shaved on screen in a single take . She tried not to lose her head along with her hair . " It was a one-shot deal , and that was the most stressful thing about the experience , " she says , smiling . <p> Vendetta director James McTeigue recalls the pivotal shearing as just another day at work for the unflappable Portman , 24 . <p> " The first time I saw her about the role , I had her put her hair behind her head because I wanted to see what she looked like bald . That was the only conversation we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the day was coming . I put three cameras on her , made sure the clippers were n't stuck , and then we shaved her head . She loved it and kept rubbing her head . " <p> That businesslike attitude is on display over an evening chat at the Mandarin Oriental hotel overlooking Central Park . Portman is a pixie in a short-sleeved , dark blue frilly blouse , skintight jeans and silver ballerina flats , her eyes heavily made up for a day of press . But V for Vendetta , which opens Friday , is the first glimpse of a flintier , feistier Portman . The film is based on the graphic novel of the same name , co-written by Alan Moore and David Lloyd , published 15 years ago . <p> The movie , which rests largely on Portman 's diminutive shoulders , is her first starring role in a potential blockbuster . She 's the biggest name in the film and has been working overtime to promote it , particularly because its producers , the Matrix trilogy 's Wachowski brothers , do not speak to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 13 in The Professional , is more than up to the challenge . She has a psychology degree from Harvard and a roster of prestigious films under her narrow belt . <p> Anthony Minghella , who directed Portman in 2003 's Cold Mountain , praises her curiosity and calls the actress " disarmingly intelligent . She reminds me a little of Jodie Foster , because I can see her , as time goes on , wanting to spread her wings beyond acting . Her big brain wants to be fed . " <p> She recently completed Milos Forman 's historic drama Goya 's Ghosts and earned an Oscar nomination for playing a temptress in Mike Nichols ' 2004 relationship chiller Closer . And now , as Evey , Portman battles a regime that does n't value human rights and freedom of expression . Evey goes from timid to tenacious with the help of the mysterious , masked V ( Hugo Weaving ) , who opposes the government and happens to have a major chip on his shoulder . <p> Weaving replaced James Purefoy three weeks into the shoot , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shares most of her scenes with the faceless fighter . The two new co-stars broke the ice over " a very nice Thai meal in Berlin , " Weaving says . <p> He describes his co-star as " extremely smart and sweet and very small " and " very relaxed . " <p> Portman says she opted to take the role of Evey because she was " excited by the prospect of making a big , entertaining movie that also had substance , " she says . <p> Vendetta , set in London , was filmed in Berlin last spring at historic Babelsberg Studios . V 's home , the palatial underground Shadow Gallery , was shot on the same soundstage where Fritz Lang filmed his thriller Metropolis in 1927 . For the Israeli-born Portman , spending nearly three months in Germany was eye-opening . <p> " As a Jew growing up , I 'd never been to Germany before , " she says . " I fell in love with Berlin . The movie is about a totalitarian regime , and seeing a city that 's been through a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ environment . And it 's also a great city . It 's like New York once was , full of artists and young people before it became prohibitively expensive . " <p> To speak like a Londoner , Portman spent a month working with a dialect coach . Portman acknowledges that she got carried away . " I stayed in the accent all the time . They told me that 's the best way to get the tune and rhythm , " she says . " But then my mom said , ' Really , Natalie , enough already . This is crazy . ' I 'd call her on the phone and be like , ' Hellooo , Mum . ' " <p> And that 's about as personal as Portman gets . She 's polite , chirpy even , yet from her darting glances and crisp answers , you get the feeling she does n't relish talking about herself . That 's not to say she ca n't let loose . After admiring a Wonder Woman T-shirt , she laughs at how illogical it is that the superhero 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughs when recounting one tabloid story that had her dating David Schwimmer , whom she had " never even met ! " <p> But do n't expect Portman to air her dirty laundry in public . The less you know about the enigmatic actress , the happier she is . <p> " I 'm a really open person , " she insists . " Everyone I 'm close to knows everything about me . But I have friends to tell my problems to , and I have no desire to tell them to strangers . Public confessional is not something I 'm tempted to do . " <p> Portman is n't chased by paparazzi . She does n't get into drunken brawls outside bars . And while you wo n't generally find her dancing up a storm with starlet tabloid princesses at various velvet-rope destinations , Portman does like to have a good time . She even spoofed her good-girl image in a gangsta rap she performed while hosting Saturday Night Live on March 4 . The concept , she said , came to her when she and the writers " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprising thing coming from little conservative me ? It seemed pretty funny . " <p> In fact , Portman says she 's anything but boring . <p> " People are always like , ' You do n't party ! Do you have any fun in your life ? ' And I 'm like , ' I do party . ' But I party with my friends . I 'm not hanging out with tabloid targets . I hang out in my friends ' apartments , and we go to non-Hollywoody clubs . " <p> Besides , " I 'm 24 ! I have fun . I 'm not , like , doing drugs or being nuts . I like laughing more than anything . " <p> She also loves to get as much shut-eye as possible and admits to picking her cuticles , a habit she ca n't kick : " I 'm prone to it . " <p> The actress gets most animated when discussing her favorite college courses ( American literature , poetry and two classes taught by law professor Alan Dershowitz ) and some books she has read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Love in the Time of Cholera . <p> She gasps excitedly when told about an upcoming biographical book of doomed British queen Anne Boleyn . And she 'll happily discuss dreams and what they might mean ( not much , according to one of her Harvard classes ) . <p> The recent Vogue cover girl is dismissive of style-related chitchat because " it 's more interesting to talk about real stuff rather than frivolous fashion stuff . " <p> Still , Portman wears Lanvin , Chanel and young designers like Zac Posen , whom she met four years ago through a mutual friend at Harvard when Posen was making clothes in his parents ' apartment . She has been donning his dresses ever since . <p> Posen says Portman is " the kind of woman that does n't define herself by image or fashion . She 's a big activist for animals , does n't wear fur or leather and tries not to wear leather shoes . She 's not caught up in the industry ( politics ) at all . She has her little house and her little dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is " infectious and gregarious . You feel like she 's got great parents who have nurtured her and have set a high bar for her . " <p> The actress has two homes , one near her parents on Long Island and one in Manhattan . She drives an eco-friendly Toyota Prius and says navigating Manhattan 's traffic is " fun . " And she has an incognito security guy in tow to keep the pesky Star Wars fans at bay . <p> The biggest perk of being Queen Amidala ? <p> " You get so much access . I 've gotten to travel to Tunisia and Japan and Australia and Romania . I 've gotten to talk to Bill Clinton and Ehud Olmert . For a 24-year-old , that 's so lucky and rare , " she says . <p> Her voice swells with passion as she talks about the " feminization of poverty " and how reading about Jordan 's Queen Rania got her involved in the Foundation for International Community Assistance , a non-profit that helps the poor with banking services and offers mothers help in caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in Uganda with the program , and I saw a woman who 'd been in the program for 10 years . She started out on less than $1 a day and had 10 kids , and her husband was beating her . Now she runs a restaurant , and one of her daughters is in university . You can turn it around . " <p> Sounds just like something Evey would say . <p> In the futuristic V for Vendetta , Evey ( Natalie Portman ) fulfills V 's dream by destroying Parliament , a symbol of an England ruled by an oppressive regime .  - -  'V ' also can be for violence V believes that " blowing up a building can change the world , " which can be seen as rebellion  --  or terrorism . <p> Portman and director James McTeigue talk about the controversy over whether the movie glorifies acts of terrorism . <p> *Portman : The film " raises a lot of the most important questions , which are those that do n't have answers . Namely , those about violence and when , if ever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always think , what would drive me to commit an act of violence ? To protect the people I love : my family . " <p> *McTeigue : " It 's a work of fiction , and it 's a film and ( the bombing ) does feed into the narrative of the whole piece . I think people will recognize that and take away what they want when that happens . " <p> PHOTO , Color , Robin Holland for USA TODAY PHOTO , B/W , Warner Bros .
