One <p> The wipers cut semicircles through the snow on the windshield . It 's good snow , I thought as I slid forward and rested my chin on the vinyl of the front seat . <p> " Sit back , honey , " my mother , Mary , gently commanded . She was thirty-nine years old , but her tired eyes and the streaks of gray infiltrating her otherwise coal black hair made most people think she was much older . If your age was determined by what you 'd been through in life , they would have been right . <p> " But Mom , I ca n't see the snow when I sit back . " <p> " Okay . But just until we stop for gas . " <p> I scooted up farther and rested my worn Keds on the hump that ran through the middle of our old Pinto station wagon . I was skinny and tall for my age , which made my knees curl up toward my chest . Mom said I was safer in the backseat , but deep down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was about the radio . I was constantly playing with it , changing the dial from her boring Perry Como station to something that played real music . <p> As we continued toward the gas station , I could see the edge of downtown Mount Vernon through the snow . A thousand points of red and green Christmas lights lined the edges of Main Street . Hot summer days in Washington State were rare , but when they happened , the light poles covered in Christmas lights seemed out of place . They hung there in a kind of backward hibernation until a city worker would plug them in and replace the bulbs that did n't wake up . But now , in December , the lights were working their magic , filling us kids with excitement for the season . <p> That year I was more anxious than excited . I wanted it to be the year that Christmas finally returned to normal . For years , Christmas mornings in our home had been filled with gifts and laughter and smiling faces . But my father had died three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had died with him . <p> Before my father 's death I did n't think much about our financial situation . We were n't wealthy , we were n't poor  --  we just were . We 'd had a nice house in a good neighborhood , a hot dinner every night and , one summer , when I was five years old , we even went to Disneyland . I remember getting dressed up for the airplane ride . The only other vacation I remember happened a few years later when my parents took me to Birch Bay  --  which sounds exotic but was really just a rocky beach about an hour away from our home . <p> Back then we never wanted for anything , except maybe more time together . <p> My father bought City Bakery when I was young  --  it had been in town since the 1800s . He put in long hours at work , leaving almost every morning before the sun ( or his son ) rose . My mother would get me off to school , clean up around the house a little , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bakery for the rest of the day . <p> After school I would walk to the bakery to help my parents out . On some days the walk took less than half an hour , but it usually took me a lot longer . At least a few days each week I would stop at the edge of downtown in the middle of the bridge that crossed the I5 freeway and watch the cars and trucks whiz by . A lot of kids would stand there and spit onto the roadway below , hoping to hit a car , but I was n't that kind of kid . I just imagined myself spitting . <p> I complained a lot about having to be at the bakery so much , especially when my dad made me wash the pots and pans , but secretly I loved to watch him work . Others might have called him a baker , but I thought of him as a master craftsman or a sculptor . Instead of a chisel he used dough , and instead of clay he used frosting  --  but the result was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both apprenticed in their father 's bakery from the time they were my age . Donning aprons , they washed a seemingly never-ending line of pots and pans , and they would learn recipes after school . In my dad 's case , it was n't long before the apprentice was more skilled than the master . <p> Dad just had a knack for baking . He was the only one in the family who could bring his recipes to life . It was n't long before City Bakery 's breads and desserts were known as the best in town . Dad loved his creations almost as much as he loved his family . <p> Saturdays were special because it was the day my father spent most of his time icing and decorating cakes . Not coincidentally , it was also the day I liked to work with him the most . Well , work might be a bit of an exaggeration , as I did n't do much baking myself . Taking bread out of the proof box after it had risen was about as far as he 'd let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took advantage of my role as " official frosting taster " as often as possible . <p> Although Dad continually tried to teach me his recipes , I never quite got them down . Mom blamed it on my having the attention span of a gnat , but I knew it was really because I liked eating better than I liked baking . I was never interested in being a baker ; it was too much work and you had to get up way too early . But Dad never gave up hope that one day I might change my mind . <p> His first mission was to teach me how to make cookies , but not long after putting me in charge of the cookie dough and mixer he realized he 'd made a mistake . A big mistake . If he 'd left me alone with that raw dough for just a few more minutes , he would n't have had enough left to bake . After that , Dad smartly switched his tactic from hands-on lessons to pop quizzes . He 'd show me how to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd test me on the recipe and toss flour in my face when I invariably mentioned some ingredient that had no business being in a cake . Like meat . <p> One day , right in the middle of an apple-strudel quiz , Dad 's cashier ( my mother ) came into the back to ask if he 'd mind helping a customer . This was n't entirely unusual  --  Dad would come up front once in a while , mainly in the afternoons while the ovens were cooling and my mom made the daily trip to the bank . I think it was secretly one of his favorite times of the day ; he was a real people person , and he loved to watch the faces of his customers as they sampled his latest creation . <p> That day , I watched as Dad greeted Mrs. Olsen , a woman who seemed to me like the oldest person in town . She was a regular customer . When my mom waited on her , I noticed that she 'd always spend a little extra time just listening to Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lonely . Dad treated her with the same kind of respect . He smiled warmly as he spoke to her , and I noticed the faintest hint of a smile begin to form on her face as well . Dad had that effect on a lot of people . <p> Mrs. Olsen had come in for a single loaf of bread , but Dad spent five minutes trying to talk her into everything from his napoleons to his German chocolate cake . She kept refusing , but my dad insisted , saying it was all on him . She finally relented , and her smile stretched from ear to ear . She told him that he was too kind . I remember the word " kind " because I thought it was simple , and yet so true . My dad was kind . <p> After her bread had been bagged and her free treats boxed , Mrs. Olsen reached into her purse and pulled out a kind of money I 'd never seen before . As far as I could tell it was n't cash . It looked more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As she turned to leave the store , my heart began to race . Had Dad just been scammed right in front of me ? The bakery paid our bills ( and , more importantly , it paid for my presents ) . I crept up next to my father at the cash register and , not thinking she could hear me , whispered , " Dad , that 's not money . " <p> Mrs. Olsen stopped dead in her tracks and looked at my father . He , in turn , glared at me . " Eddie , into the back , please . Right now . " His voice had a definite edge to it . He then gave Mrs. Olsen a sympathetic nod and another warm smile , and she turned and continued out the door . I knew I was in trouble . <p> As I walked through the opening into the back , my face felt hotter than the oven I was now standing in front of . " Eddie , I know you did n't mean it , but do you know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , " I replied . I honestly did n't . <p> " Eddie , Mrs. Olsen is a very good customer of ours . Her husband passed away about a year ago and she 's had a hard time making ends meet . You 're right , what she gave me is n't money , but it 's just like it for people who need it . They 're called food stamps , and our government is helping her buy groceries until she can get back on her feet . We do n't talk about them in front of her because she does n't like the fact that she has to ask others for help . " <p> Dad explained that while our family would never accept help from anyone , especially the government , there were good people who needed it . I immediately felt sorry for Mrs. Olsen  --  sorry for anyone who needed to rely on others for that kind of help . And I was glad that we would never be in that position . <p> A few months later I got a chance to prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mom had once again run to the bank , and I was in the front of the store putting fresh macaroons into the display case while Dad waited on customers . I watched as , once again , he accepted the funny-looking coupons as payment  --  this time from a guy buying bread , a pie , and a dozen cookies . But now , instead of warm smiles , friendly conversation , and yummy dessert suggestions , my father was completely silent . <p> After the customer left it was my turn to do the questioning . I followed him into the back . " What 's wrong , Dad ? " I asked . <p> " I know that man , Eddie . He can work , but he chooses not to . Anyone who can earn money has no business taking it from others . " <p> I eventually came to understand that my father , who 'd grown up poor and struggled for everything we owned , had continually rejected offers of help from others . He had worked hard to build a business and provide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same . " The government , " he told me one night , " is there to act as a safety net , not a candy machine . " <p> I do n't know if my mother had grown up with the same attitude or if she 'd just learned it from all those years with my dad  --  but she felt the exact same way . With him now gone we were really struggling , but she refused to consider asking anyone for help . " We 'll get through this , Eddie , " she told me more than once . " Things are just a little tight right now , but there are so many others who need it more than we do . " <p> As usual , Mom was being an optimist . " A little tight " did n't begin to describe how frugal we had become . When we went out to dinner , which was only on very special occasions , she would always give me the same warning before the waitress appeared : " Remember , Eddie , do n't order any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No need to be wasteful . " <p> I knew better . It was n't about waste , it was about money . That was all it was ever about . Mom worked seemingly endless hours at a seemingly endless number of jobs , our house was crumbling faster than Dad 's famous apple turnovers , and I had n't gotten a brag-worthy Christmas present since the Star Wars Millennium Falcon I 'd gotten two years earlier . <p> But this year would be different . I had been on my best behavior for months now . I 'd taken out the garbage before Mom had asked , used my finely honed dishwashing skills at home , and had generally made sure that she would n't have any excuse to not get me the bike I deserved . <p> Still , I was n't leaving anything to chance . Every time a relative or neighbor asked what I wanted for Christmas , I made sure my mother was close enough to hear my finely tuned response : A red Huffy bike with a black banana seat . <p> The Ford 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We were on Main Street , and the once distant lights now glowed brightly through our foggy windows . I tried to look out the back windshield to see where we were , but I could only see my mop of dirty-blond hair reflecting back . <p> Mom drove cautiously , although downtown seemed to be virtually deserted . A light turned red at the intersection ahead , and she slowly eased the car to a stop . <p> " Eddie , look ! " She was pointing out the passenger-side window . <p> I rubbed my hand back and forth on the glass to clear the condensation . We had come to a stop right outside Richmond 's Sporting Goods ' big storefront window , the very place I had first seen the Huffy I 'd been dreaming about all year . <p> My eyes expertly searched the window , darting from baseball bats to gloves to sleds to ... there it was . The Huffy . My Huffy . Its bright red frame , shiny chrome handlebars , and black banana seat sparkled brilliantly through the snow and fog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word I could come up with . <p> Mom was n't looking at the bike anymore , she was looking at me in the rearview mirror . I could n't see her mouth , but I knew that she was smiling . I smiled back . Perry Como provided the sound track . <p> " You want to pump the gas ? " she asked a few minutes later as she pulled up to the self-service island . We stopped for gas a lot because our Pinto was always thirsty and Mom usually only had enough money to fill the tank partway . <p> " Sure , " I said , leaping over the seat and following her out the door . " Can I get some Red Vines when I go in to pay ? " <p> " I 'm sorry , Eddie , " my mother said gently . " I have the money for Red Vines but not enough for the dentist . " She smiled . " Now , scoot . " I knew she did n't have money for the dentist , but her excuse did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money for Red Vines either . <p> I gave her the best look of disappointment I could muster . Still , deep down , I had hope . No money for Red Vines could mean that she was saving it all for something else . <p> My bike . <p> Copyright 2008 by Mercury Radio Arts , Inc . <br> Continues ...
