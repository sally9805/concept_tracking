Can it happen to us ? As traffic lights and elevators went dead across Northern California last week , millions of Americans were all asking themselves that question , getting nostalgic for that trusty old utility monopoly . Maybe , it suddenly seemed to many shocked onlookers , electricity deregulation was n't such a great idea after all . Even the most committed capitalists had to be having second thoughts about the merits of the free market for power  --  while praying that their own state would n't soon be plagued by blackouts , near bankrupt utilities and bulging electricity bills . <P> The short answer is , yes , you are probably in line for deregulation . Nearly half the states , from New York , Pennsylvania and Virginia to Texas , Arizona and Oregon , are in various stages of deregulating their part of the nation 's vast , $218 billion electricity system . <P> That does n't mean they are going to duplicate California 's calamity . But the promised benefits of deregulation have for the most part remained just that . New York City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Northwest , Oregon and Washington , which typically import power from California in the winter , have recently been sending juice south and find themselves exposed to a cruel market driven up by their neighbor 's woes . " Retail utilities may lack the financial resources to purchase needed supplies or build the generation we all agree is necessary , " Oregon Governor John Kitzhaber wrote in a letter to outgoing Energy Secretary Bill Richardson last month . <P> To critics , the evidence is clear and the verdict is in : deregulation is a bad idea for something as vital as electricity . " This is not a commodity that is conducive to the market ; you ca n't store it on the demand side , " says Mark Cooper , research director at the Consumer Federation of America . " We are finally having a debate we should have had in the 1990s . " <P> Back then it sounded so simple . Deregulation brought prices down on airline tickets and long-distance phone calls . Why not get the government out of electricity and watch prices fall ? With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decades ago to 15% today  --  the free market would encourage private suppliers to compete for customers , offering lower rates and more reliable service . <P> In practice , of course , it has been a whole lot messier . The nation 's old , Balkanized transmission grid is n't built to handle so much long-distance traffic . And freshly liberated markets wo n't necessarily attract new suppliers because the cost of entry  --  a multibillion-dollar power plant  --  is high . So real competition is , by and large , harder to find . " If deregulation is a good idea , and it still may be , it needs to be implemented when you have the infrastructure in place , " says James Bernstein , commerce commissioner of Minnesota , which still has a regulated electricity system and may have a power shortfall by 2006 . <P> The unusually harsh winter has also served notice that a commodity influenced by weather has plenty of surprises in store for purchasers . Most newer power plants are fueled by natural gas , the price of which goes up as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are more insulated from these free-market insults .
