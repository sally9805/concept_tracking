Okay , so the weather stinks and so does the hiking . Change both by heading down the road to where the sun shines and the trail beckons . Photograph Photograph Great Sand Dunes National Monument and Wilderness , Colorado // Confession time , and be honest now : You 're a fair-weather camper , are n't you ? Do n't be afraid to admit it , because the truth will set you free . Do you know anyone who loads a pack and fights traffic for a few hours , then gets to the trailhead and gushes with joy at the prospect of hiking through soul-soaking rain or smothering fog and slug belly-gray skies or humidity so thick it feels like you 're breathing through a warm washcloth ? ( Well , there was that weird guy in the college outing club who liked to pull the wings off flies .... ) There 's nothing finer than blue-sky hiking , and we all yearn for it .

Seattle/Portland Photograph Wenaha-Tucannon Wilderness , eastern Washington // Seattle/ Portland Area Chemists know water exists in three natural states : solid , liquid and gas .

Arrange for a pickup there or return the way you came .
