What if the denizens of Sesame Street grew up into profane , broke , self-doubting college grads who kept some of their innocence but developed potty mouths ? That 's the premise of Avenue Q , the hip new musical comedy starring puppets ( yep , that 's puppets and hip in the same sentence ) that opened last week on Broadway . <P> The brainchild of songwriters Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx , Avenue Q is the kind of place where the word of the day is schadenfreude and five nightstands rearrange themselves into a " one-night stand . " Instead of spelling bees and ABCs , the characters , including Princeton , an earnest , clean-cut college grad , and his sometime girlfriend Kate Monster , a kindergarten aide , confront such grownup issues as unemployment , sex and the rent . <P> There 's Cookie Monster 's alter ego , Trekkie Monster , who is addicted to Internet porn , and a pair of sexualized Ernie and Bert characters , Nicky and Rod , who room together but do n't sleep together , much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they sing jaunty little songs about racism ( Everyone 's a Little Bit Racist ) and depression ( There Is Life Outside Your Apartment ) while falling in love , getting evicted and coming out . <P> Onstage the puppeteers are visible , but their puppets get away with behavior for which humans would be sent to their rooms . Amid it all , the characters grow up and move on . Puppet-on-puppet action is quite a sight , but the show 's real charm is that unlike its main characters , it has a heart .  --  By Kate Betts
