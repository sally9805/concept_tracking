Pounding the pavement in search of the most elegant watches around , our fashion insider finds that timing is everything . By Lynn Hirschberg // AS I WAS WALKING up the stairs to the second floor of the plush new Hermes store on Madison Avenue , I kept thinking about the power of the wristwatch . I had come to look at watches ; to see , specifically , the Cape Cod Double Tour , a square-faced watch with a leather band that circles the wrist twice . A friend had raved about this watch , whose distinctive strap was designed by Martin Margiela . She claimed that the Double Tour 's uptown-meets-bondage quality was wildly attractive to men . " They just ca n't take their eyes off it , " she exclaimed . I was n't sure whether that was really a good thing , but it reinforced my belief that all watch stories are somehow linked to men . They like watches . Men get twitchy and uncomfortable at the sight of bracelets or necklaces or ( worst of all ) rings , but even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A watch is serious , it usually has a history , and it always serves a purpose . These facts , along with the inherent beauty of numbers , make watches endlessly appealing to men . When they see a watch on a woman 's wrist , they have a moment of identification . It 's a part of their world that they are happy to share . For most of my life , I have worn a man 's watch . At an early age , I read J.D. Salinger 's short story " For Esme  --  with Love and Squalor , " in which a young girl wears a way-too-large military wristwatch . My mother wore a similarly outsize gold watch , a Schaffhausen that had belonged to her father . At great expense , she 'd had a gold-link band made for the watch , which had a huge round face . I wanted to be a Salinger heroine in the worst way , and the surest route seemed to be through my grandfather 's watch , with which my mother was not anxious to part . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 80s , I sensed an opening . My mother bought one , and ever entranced by the thrill of the new ( and the idea of wearing her watch in the shower and never having to wind it again ) , she bestowed upon me my dream , the Esme watch . I 've worn it ever since . Its history is significant-my grandfather , a Holocaust survivor , bought the watch in Germany after the war-and I have found that of everything I have ever owned , that watch garners the most compliments . When it 's off my wrist , I do n't feel quite like myself , and I 've found that most people have similar watch stories . My friend Peter always wears a Rolex he bought with his bar mitzvah money ; Gerry wears a Bulova automatic that was a gift from his mother ; Lisa wears a gold Hamilton that was a present from her ex-boss . And so on . All those watches have weight in a way that other accessories do n't . A watch is n't romantic in the way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watch is always with you , it has enormous resonance . This season , designers have focused on watches in a big way . Just as other accessories , like shoes and bags , have become more prominent , watches have become an important style detail . As always , I gravitate toward vintage-there is nothing more beautiful than a Patek Phillipe from the ' ' 30s-but I was surprisingly intrigued by the new watches . From Christian Dior to Bulgari to Chanel , designers are using classic shapes in interesting ways . Old is still better , but I am compelled by the idea of the new . In watches , anyway . At Hermes , the timepieces dwell in display cases that are at eye level . Unlike at a jewelry store , where you are usually looking down , here the watches seem to float into your consciousness . There are only a few basic shapes  --  the H-our , which has an H motif ; the Sellier , which is round ; and the best-selling Double Tour . " White gold sells better than yellow , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And more women buy the men 's version , with its bigger face , than the women 's version . " He wrapped the strap twice around my wrist . While the Double Tour does have a brash , sporty look , I could n't imagine wearing it with a dress . It did , however , have a touch of Esme about it-the face was outsize and bold . " We 're sold out of this watch , " Gall said . " And we 've only been open a week . " They were also sold out of most of the watches at Bulgari , just a few blocks over from Hermes , on Fifth Avenue . At Bulgari , one of the best-sellers is called the Rettangolo , and I 'm not sure why it 's so popular . The watch has a gigantic nine and an equally large three and no other numbers at all . Like all Bulgari watches , it comes plain or with diamonds . The Rettangolo looks a little jokey , like a prop watch in a movie about the 1930s . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recessed oval face , with ( or without ) a tasteful spray of diamonds and a classic Bulgari link bracelet ( or a lizard strap ) as a band . It 's feminine , which is not my usual taste in watches , but it looked right on my wrist . The Ovale was dressy without being fussy . I could see myself wearing this watch anywhere , out to the theater or to work . It has that sort of presence . " Everybody has to have that watch , " said the salesgirl , holding out her own wrist . She was wearing a white-gold Ovale with a pave-diamond face . I felt a pang of envy . Just down the street at Cartier , it was a festival of tank watches , their classic model . The style has roman numerals and a crisp , all-American look , which is odd since it was actually first worn by the French . At Carrier , there are rectangular tanks and square tanks and small , ladylike tanks and gargantuan tanks  --  and that 's about it . I tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ridiculous , but I rather liked it . There was something childlike about the hugeness of the numbers . I went to a few more watch stores , but I started to find myself in a blur . The styles became indistinct : lots of squares , lots of weirdly spaced numbers , lots of missing numbers . So many of the watches looked alike that I started concentrating on the bands . When I first started wearing my grandfather 's watch , I disliked the gold-link bracelet that my mother had had soldered to it But now my eye goes straight to ornate bands . An alligator strap looks so ordinary when compared with an intricately woven gold bracelet . That band meant a lot to my mother . She , too , had been bored by the idea of a simple strap , and her purchase of the band was symbolic . My family had lost everything in the war , and before leaving Europe for America , they bought a few things , one of which was this watch . They came to this country with no money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luxuries , one of which would be a proper band for her father 's watch . Twenty years later , she had the band made . When she gave me the watch , I told her I wanted to change the band . My eye had not adjusted to all that gold-I was a kid , and it looked too extreme and too adult . My mother was horrified at the idea that I might change the watch in any way . She almost refused to give it to me . Now I understand why . Just as I understand why Gerry ca n't take off the watch his mother gave him or why Lisa still wears the watch given to her by a former boss . These are n't just timepieces ; they are bits of personal history . And unlike most jewelry , they combine form , function , and emotion . Perhaps the Ovale or the Double Tour will provide those moments , but it will take years . A watch has to make its own history . <p>          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
