Stephanie Harkness cheered the fall of Baghdad last week for more than patriotic reasons . As CEO of Pacific Plastics &; Engineering , a medical and biotech equipment-parts firm in Soquel , Calif. , she has been waiting for customers to give her the go-ahead on four large orders . In one case , she says , " they have the money in hand but have been saying they 're not willing to make an investment until they know how the war is going to play out . " Now that things are clearer , says Harkness , " I expect a flood of new projects . " <P> If Harkness is proved right  --  and there 's good reason to believe she will be  --  Americans can look forward to better economic times soon . Already , oil prices have plunged and the stock market has rallied . Despite all the anxiety over the war , retail sales surged 2.1% in March , and the University of Michigan 's consumer-sentiment index rose in early April to 83.2 , from 77.6 . Initial jobless claims have edged lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest rates in four decades are spurring a new round of mortgage refinancing that is leaving hundreds of dollars more in consumers ' pockets each month . And as Harkness attests , the war 's end should free pent-up business demand . <P> President Bush , though , is taking nothing for granted , having learned from his father 's neglect of a slumping economy amid his soaring popularity after the first Gulf War . Only moments after watching on TV a statue of Saddam Hussein come crashing down in Baghdad , Bush met with top advisers last week to discuss ways to pass as much as possible of his proposal to stimulate the economy with $726 billion in tax cuts . <P> Few forecasters believe a " double-dip " recession is in the cards . Many expect an economic-growth rate of 3% to 4% later this year . That 's a solid and sustainable pace , though hardly the coiled spring that the unemployed , in particular , would like to see . More than 2 million jobs have been lost since Bush took office , and rapid job regeneration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5%-to-6% range  --  for at least a couple of quarters . To be sure , the road to even a moderate recovery wo n't be smooth . We 're still working off the excesses of the Internet boom . Stocks generally remain highly valued relative to stubbornly weak corporate earnings  --  and analysts are slashing second-quarter earnings estimates at twice the rate they did last year . The rising costs of war , reconstruction and homeland security will siphon away productive investment . The budget deficit is swelling , threatening to push interest rates higher . And a Business Roundtable survey last week showed that more employers are planning to cut jobs than add them . <P> Yet those who believe things are looking much better have good company . Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan last week said the economy was " prone more to long-term growth and not stagnation . " For him , that 's downright exuberant . And the downbeat Roundtable survey held a hidden gem : more than half of big-company executives said their top worry was the resiliency of the consumer  --  who is demonstrably regaining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the war in Iraq .
