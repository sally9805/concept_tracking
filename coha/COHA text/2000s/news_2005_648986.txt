<p> No one has had a better view of the capriciousness of the N.B.A. <p> As Kenyon Martin returns to play in New Jersey today for the first time since the Nets let him go in a controversial sign-and-trade with Denver last summer , he carries this distinction : He has had 5 coaches in 13 months . <p> With the Nets , he played for Byron Scott , then Lawrence Frank . With the Nuggets , Jeff Bzdelik was replaced by the interim coach Michael Cooper , and now Martin is settling in , appreciatively , with George Karl . <p> " Pretty crazy , " Martin said last week in a telephone interview . " I was just talking about that the other day . But it 's good , we 're starting to play better now . We 've got more confidence . You can tell Coach Karl has a lot of passion for the game . " <p> As for the major change in his life , he said he was gratified that the Nets ' new principal owner , Bruce C. Ratner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to re-sign him as a free agent . <p> " They should have ; he was right , " Martin said . " But I 've moved on , and so have they . " <p> Martin has kept in touch with his former teammates and spoken with Frank on the phone . " I miss the guys , " Martin said . " We had such a great group . The fans were terrific to me . " <p> He is trying to get fans involved in Denver the way he did in New Jersey , waving his arm and cupping his ear . For the first half of the season , fan enthusiasm waned as the Nuggets ' losses mounted . <p> Since Karl 's hiring , the Nuggets have gone 6-2 , coming into the Meadowlands off Friday 's nationally televised victory over Cleveland . In that game , Martin had 19 points and 8 rebounds . <p> " I did n't think the team was incorporating its talents very well , " Karl said . " They 're all great passers , almost in every position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> It is no secret that guard Andre Miller can be a reluctant passer . He and Karl clashed when Karl coached the United States team at the world championships in 2002 . The Nuggets were clearly sending a message . <p> " If you run the right way , and everybody touches the ball , there 's a reason there are no unhappy players in Phoenix , " Karl said . " The big guys blame the little guys , the wing blames the guards ; for everybody to be happy , you have to forget about blame and run . " <p> Karl sympathizes with Carmelo Anthony , who is continually compared with a fellow second-year star , LeBron James . " He 's not having a bad year ; he 's having a bad year in comparison to LeBron , " Karl said . " Wow , what a way to live . " <p> As for Martin , Karl said : " I just think he 's got to be one of our top players . He 's a great defender , and he always guards the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him become a better team defender . " <p> Karl , who was fired by Milwaukee 18 months ago , said his players understood that he was hired to execute a swift turnaround . " They know that we 're in it together and there 's this spirit of fighting , " he said . " We want to try to shut up the critics a little bit . " <p> Martin can identify with disproving critics , as well as with overcoming adversity , something he has been doing throughout his life . <p> Yesterday , he sponsored an afternoon at the N.B.A. Store in Manhattan for more than three dozen children affected by stuttering , as he was . Martin , on the board of the American Institute for Stuttering , said he felt strongly about getting his message across to them . <p> " I just want kids to feel comfortable being themselves , " he said . <p> Big Jump <p> Stephon Marbury has been vilified for proclaiming his pre-eminence as a point guard and because teams that have traded him have improved . Marbury 's reputation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sebastian Telfair , another point guard from Lincoln High School in Coney Island who made an early leap to the N.B.A. <p> The book , " The Jump : Sebastian Telfair and the High Stakes Business of High School Ball " by Ian O'Connor , describes the rift between the cousins ' families and relates how some general managers scouting Telfair for last year 's draft were concerned that he might be like Marbury . In the book , Telfair says : " I ca n't tell you how many N.B.A. people , that 's the first thing they ask : ' Is he anything like Stephon ? ' When they find out I 'm not , they 're relieved . " <p> The implication was that executives had tired of Marbury 's negative attitude and his habit of haranguing teammates . In contrast , Telfair , the book says , is a guard who pats teammates on the back after misses . <p> The Telfairs , who lived on the floor above the Marburys in the Surfside Gardens project , blame Marbury for ignoring them financially . But O'Connor writes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handling the financial burdens of N.B.A. life , making solid points about supporting his immediate family . <p> Marbury was prescient about Telfair 's limitations on the court . Before the draft , Marbury said the 5-foot-11 Telfair could play in the N.B.A. but cautioned about his size and his long-range shooting . <p> " I figured out the game only three or four years ago , " Marbury says in the book . " It 's hard . Point guard is not just another position to be coming to right out of high school . " <p> Marbury , who played one season at Georgia Tech , is now with the Knicks , his fourth N.B.A. team since 1996 . Telfair , 19 , averages 4.5 points and 10.9 minutes a game for the Portland Trail Blazers . <p> Give Him a Break <p> San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich blamed his players for the predicament . Instead of taking a break next weekend , he will coach the Western Conference All-Stars , joining Tim Duncan and Manu Ginobili in Denver . <p> " I sat Timmy , I tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said half-seriously . Nothing worked . The Spurs played one more game than Phoenix by the Feb. 6 cutoff and finished percentage points ahead of the Suns . Duncan missed two games with a right ankle injury . <p> " Truth be told , coaches look forward to that All-Star break , just like players do , " Popovich said . " I look forward to it because it 's a great time to assess the first half , change a few things , figure out what you did well , what you did poorly , rest and mentally get away . <p> " Our players did a good enough job to send our coaching staff . That was Timmy 's prime motivation : if he has to go , we have to go . He worked hard to make that happen . " <p> Raptors ' Downward Spiral Continues <p> When Toronto 's first-year coach , Sam Mitchell , got into a locker-room shouting match after yanking guard Rafer Alston from last Wednesday 's game in Cleveland , the Raptors spiraled further out of control . <p> Mitchell has sparred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard line by benching and suspending him , actions that made him more angry . <p> The team 's first-year general manager , Rob Babcock , took his player 's side on Friday , either a bad omen for Mitchell or a way to soften Alston 's troubled image for a future trade . <p> " This last incident was not Rafer 's fault ; it was Sam 's fault , " Babcock said . " They are very similar personalities . They want to win , they have high expectations of their teammates , they are both very confrontational . They are each part of the problem . " <p> Babcock said that he would stand by Alston , his premier off-season acquisition , and that he had had a discussion with Mitchell about his rookie mistakes . <p> " You do n't just give up on somebody because he has some areas to work on , " Babcock said . <p> Alston is not the only one who is upset with Mitchell 's methods and rotation . Eric Williams , the key player acquired in the Vince Carter trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last few weeks . Babcock said he did not want to trade Williams , either . <p> Durable Old Guard Is Going <p> Karl Malone and Reggie Miller let it be known last week that they would retire . Malone , who has not played since having knee surgery last summer , decided against joining San Antonio . Miller will finish the season with Indiana . <p> Two of the league 's most durable stars who primarily played for one team each throughout their careers , Malone and Miller share one frustrating distinction . Despite their playoff feats , neither has won a championship . Miller has one last shot . <p> Malone , who spent his final season with the Lakers , played in 1,476 games and scored 36,928 points . Remarkably , he missed only nine games in 18 seasons with the Utah Jazz . <p> Miller has played in 1,356 games and scored 24,696 points . Despite sitting out 16 games this season because of a broken hand and a suspension , Miller has missed only 45 games over 18 seasons . <p> URL : http @ @
