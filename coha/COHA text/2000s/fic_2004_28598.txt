Chapter One HE WOULD NEVER find her here - never ! But Mark knew he had to try . Grimly , he strode through the wrought-iron gates into the unfamiliar melee of Seattle Center on a Saturday afternoon . This place was huge , and crammed with relaxed , slow-moving throngs . And in this crowd he was going to find Laura ? A woman he had n't seen in six years ? First he must find the clowns . He knew that much . She would be there performing with them . And when his search ended , what then ? He pushed a hand through his fair , sun-streaked hair and looked around . Somehow he had gotten the idea from Laura 's landlord that this was a little city park . " Oh , you mean Buffo , the clown , " the man had said . " She and the troupe are down at the Center doing their act . They 've got some big do going there today . Ca n't waste weather like this . She was off like a shot this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city fathers ' land providing sufficient play space for the citizens of Seattle . It was a vast complex of buildings - opera house , theaters , coliseum , eating places and shops - scattered among expanses of beautifully tended grounds . And wherever he looked there were people - milling , laughing , oblivious to his small problem . Only his problem was n't small to him . Whatever was going to happen when - or if - he found Laura Fenton would shape the rest of his life . He tried not to look too grim or be rude as he elbowed a path through the aimless wanderers . These were all just people out for a good time on a late-summer 's day , he reminded himself , but they were still a real pain to him . They kept blocking his view and getting in his way . They gathered in clusters to watch anything at all , then broke up and drifted elsewhere . And he must always find out what they were watching , because it might be the clown he was hunting who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them , time and again , being polite , carefully sidestepping small children , mumbling apologies , only to find a break-dancing contest or a magician performing tricks or something else he did n't want to see . Everywhere he drew a blank , but pushed on doggedly , always heading for any flash of color that might indicate clowns . If only so much did n't depend on this . He looked around in exasperation . Where were all these people coming from ? He 'd never thought of Seattle as a big city . And it was n't supposed to be this hot , either . He 'd always heard it was a gray and chilly place . A fleeting recollection of Laura , cross-legged and squinting up from a picnic blanket distracted him . They were in her uncle 's yard behind the luxurious old Victorian mansion in Pacific Heights - a fashionable area of San Francisco where they 'd both grown up . Mark , about to graduate from law school , had been trying to help her cram for semester exams in her senior high-school year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ threatened her with the dire consequences of not getting her diploma and he 'd been unable to stop his own smile . She 'd been a wild one even then . Her carefree laughter had made his attempt to offer stern guidance hopeless . With her he 'd often felt a freedom and spontaneity that did n't exist in the rest of his life . He released a bitter sigh . Only when they read poetry together did she become serious and introspective . He remembered thinking that she had seemed to deserve so much more love than she 'd received in her life , and his empathy for her had engendered a special kind of comradeship between them . Then one ghastly morning , in a driving rainstorm , everything had changed . He 'd seen Laura Fenton as she really was : worthless and destructive . Now what he must do was find her , do what he had to do , then separate their lives again as soon as possible . Suddenly he saw them - the clowns . Not ten feet away . The crowd shifted , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white mime face above a red-striped T-shirt . There was another figure in shimmering green-and-yellow satin , and yet another in a big Afro wig of orange and pale purple . The whole troupe was there , with Laura hidden somewhere among them . He pushed his way through the crowd and stood watching the performance , grimly intent , his eyes narrowed against the brilliant sun , which shone warmly on his face . The rest of the leisurely Saturday crowd enjoyed the clowns ' antics as they went through their routines . The troupe was clever , skillful and best of all , fun . Always moving - the clowns worked hard to hold the attention of the onlookers as long as they could . He tried to check a weary anger . Laura 's remembered laughter sounded once more in his mind . That girl he had known , in her heedless search for a good time , would have seen his present search as a big joke . She 'd have thought his desperate scanning of the painted faces to find hers , very funny . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes had she would make his task as difficult for him as possible . No , he realized , that assumption was n't fair . She had no idea he was within a thousand miles of her . She probably had n't given him a thought for six years . Did she ever think of him at all ? Of anyone she 'd left behind in San Francisco to pick up the pieces ? Or would she have shut her loved ones out of her mind along with all the havoc she had caused ? Did he still hate her for it ? Somewhere he 'd read that hatred can not be sustained , that it dies of its own burdensome weight . How true . The hatred of Laura was finally gone , but bitterness remained . He had tried to understand . He recalled her Uncle George 's kindly eyes and counsel . " Try to understand , Mark . She 's very young . Her background is ... well , things ca n't have been too easy for her , although we tried our best . " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had said virtually the same thing . " You must n't be so bitter , Mark . Try to understand . As the French say , ' To understand is to forgive . ' Remember Laura 's mother virtually dumped the child on poor George and Rhea . The woman never came back . The next we heard of her , she was dead . Laura 's never known what it means to feel truly loved . " Well , he understood well enough . He also still remembered the days when he 'd longed to help her , to let her know he at least cared about her . But forgive , after what came later ? That was something else . She had cost him - cost them all - too much . Oh , yes , far too much . What would she say if she knew that he stood this close to her now , unforgiving ? She 'd probably just laugh .
