<p> The Miami Heat rolled the dice and made massive personnel changes this season , including the coach , betting the moves would get them to the NBA Finals . But the popular preseason choice to win the Eastern Conference is n't playing like a title contender . <p> " There is a sense of urgency to win the whole thing , " says 34-year-old Shaquille O'Neal , who promised Miami a title after he left the Los Angeles Lakers in 2004 . " Getting to the Finals does nothing for me . " <p> To get to the Finals , the Heat probably must go through the Detroit Pistons  --  and in recent weeks Miami has lost twice to the reigning Eastern Conference champions . The Heat were unable to protect a 12-point third-quarter lead in a March 22 road loss at Detroit , and they were 0-for-10 from three-point range in an April 6 home loss . <p> The Heat ( 51-27 ) have the second-best record in the conference and the fifth-best mark overall . But they are 6-6 of late and beset by injuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muscle ) , guard Jason Williams ( right knee tendinitis ) and forward James Posey ( right Achilles ' tendinitis ) are ailing . Only Posey probably will return before the playoffs . <p> Still , that does not account for Miami 's 2-12 record against division leaders Detroit , New Jersey Nets , San Antonio Spurs , Denver Nuggets and Phoenix Suns . Miami held the leaders below 45.4% shooting from the field , the league average , five times in 14 games . Defense , for sure , is a glaring deficiency . Miami is 13th in points allowed ( 95.9 a game ) , 15th in assists-to-turnovers ( 1.5 a game ) and next-to-last in steals ( 6.3 a game ) . <p> " They 've won some games , but ... they 're just beating up on bad teams , basically , " TNT analyst Steve Kerr says . " It 's not often that you all of a sudden see teams start beating good teams in the playoffs when they have n't done it all season . There is little reason to believe Miami can win @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly was the objective when Pat Riley , in his role as club president , overhauled the Heat 's roster after they lost to Detroit in Game 7 of the conference finals . It 's also what led him back to coaching . <p> Riley won four championships with the Lakers in the 1980s . But he has n't taken a team to the Finals since 1994 , when he coached the New York Knicks . He makes no secret that the idea of winning another title is what drives him . <p> " For me , it 's always been my deepest priority , even the years when we were n't in the playoffs , " he says . " I thought a miracle would ( happen ) and get us there . It 's not any different . I want to win deeply and win a championship . " <p> To get over the hump , the Heat acquired Posey , Williams and forward Antoine Walker , a former All-Star , in a four-team trade and signed guard Gary Payton , another former All-Star , as a free agent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heat more playmakers after they were caught short in the conference finals when Dwyane Wade suffered a rib injury . <p> Twenty-one games into the season , Riley replaced Stan Van Gundy as coach . Van Gundy , who resigned for what he said were personal reasons , was 112-73 in two-plus seasons and led Miami to the playoffs in each of his two full seasons . <p> " They took a gamble , for sure , " Kerr says of the changes . " To this point , I do n't think anybody has been too impressed with the results . " <p> Miami has played .702 ball under Riley . The Heat were 11-10 when he took over , and O'Neal missed 19 of those 21 games with a sprained right ankle . But Riley is n't satisfied . <p> " They understand me a little bit more , what I want , " says Riley , who has the Heat running more than they did under Van Gundy . " I have n't been happy with the last ( 12 ) games . We 've been up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that plays real hard when we 're down . <p> " We 've fallen victim to mistakes , turnovers , bad shots and not completing the task . That 's disturbing to me for a veteran team . We have to focus and concentrate on every possession . " <p> Shortcomings on defense <p> Defense was a hallmark during Riley 's previous tenure as Heat coach . That 's no longer the case . <p> " Our defense has been our biggest setback , " says Mourning , a two-time NBA defensive player of the year . " It has kept us from getting to that next level . ... <p> " We 're so offensive-minded ( sixth in the league at 100.2 points a game ) and things come to us so easy offensively , we have a tendency at times to forget about ... what championship teams have done in the past . They 've been successful defensive teams . " <p> The Heat have had extreme difficulty containing perimeter scorers . <p> New Jersey guard Vince Carter averaged 38.5 points in four games against them and had 51 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 32.3 , with a high of 47 , in four games . The Cleveland Cavaliers ' LeBron James averaged 41.0 points in four games , scoring 47 twice . <p> Last season the Heat could call on Eddie Jones , a three-time NBA all-defense pick , to defend opponents ' top perimeter scorers and be their third scoring option behind Wade and O'Neal . Jones was traded to the Memphis Grizzlies in the deal that landed Williams , Posey and Walker . <p> Posey was expected to fill Jones ' role defensively , but he has yet to measure up . <p> " We can be better , " Riley says . " We talked about three things that are really a must for us . I failed to mention , as assistant coach Ronnie Rothstein warned me , about our containment defense , our perimeter defense . I did n't want to embarrass them by talking in the media about the fact that we ca n't guard anybody . So I 'm not . " <p> Pressure is on <p> Miami 's roster includes five current or former All-Stars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The pressure is clearly on the Heat to live up to preseason expectations . <p> " It 's all good pressure , " Walker says . " We 're a very focused group , understanding what 's in front of us . " <p> Walker , Payton and Mourning , who has come back to play after having a kidney transplant in 2003 , are veterans chasing their first championship rings . They are nearing the end of their careers , and this could be their last chance at a title . <p> " We do n't want to waste this time , " Mourning says . " This team has older veteran players on it . It 's no telling what Riles is going to do at the end of the season . We have a great opportunity . " <p> Riley , a master motivator , tells Heat veterans who have n't won a title that they are entitled to a championship ring . <p> " Why not you ? Why Bruce Bowen ? Why Chauncey Billups ? " is his sales pitch . " These guys have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ competing and having great years . Why ca n't they be a champion , also ? " <p> O'Neal , in his 14th season , has said repeatedly that his goal is to retire second only to Bill Russell in championship rings . Russell won 11 with the Boston Celtics . <p> O'Neal has three , all with the Lakers , the last coming in 2002 . He is having the poorest statistical season of his career , averaging 20.2 points and 9.2 rebounds , and is second in the league in personal fouls a game ( 3.9 ) . <p> " The calls he used to get he 's not getting , " ESPN analyst Steve Jones says . " The referees have adjusted their officiating to make it a little bit more difficult for Shaq to have the advantage he used to have . <p> " He has n't adjusted enough . He used to be able to back that diesel into people , lay ' em on the floor , lay it in and run to the other end . " <p> One school of thought is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double- and triple-teamed is catching up with him and he has lost a step . <p> " He used to go around guys , " TNT 's Kerr says . " Now he 's trying to go through guys more . ( Against ) defenders who are willing to take the punishment , like Jason Collins in New Jersey , that 's where you see where Shaq has lost some of his side-to-side mobility . " <p> O'Neal , who has dropped 30 pounds and is down to 320 , is trying to round himself into playoff form . <p> He had the second triple-double of his career Tuesday against the Toronto Raptors with 15 points , 10 assists and 11 rebounds in 28 minutes . <p> " I 'm getting there , " he says . " I know it 's going to be up to me to help lead the team . I 'm trying to get myself ready physically and mentally . I feel real good . I 'm getting ready for it , to make that run .
