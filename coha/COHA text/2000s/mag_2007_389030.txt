Where Lightning Strikes Q. A friend of mine told me that I should always disconnect the positive terminal of the battery first to keep the electricity from spilling out of the battery . I ca n't see how this would matter . I just unhook whichever terminal is closest first . I 've never noticed any spilled electricity , and I think he 's just pulling my leg . A. Let me relate something that happened to a friend of mine , a dentist by trade who likes to work on his sports car occasionally . In preparation for some other work , he elected to remove the battery from the car , using a box wrench to loosen the battery clamps . The wrench made contact with his wedding ring ( he 's lefthanded ) , and the ring in turn made contact with the battery holddown . A massive short circuit welded his ring to the holddown and to the wrench , which in turn was welded to the positive terminal . Photograph : The positive terminal of your battery can deliver dangerous amounts of current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easily . &lt;hln&gt;&lt;/hln&gt; PHOTOGRAPH BY JAMES WESTMAN Car batteries store an enormous amount of energy , and they 're optimized to deliver it in a very short period of time . A shorted car battery can easily deliver several hundred amps  --  more than an arc-welding machine . Within a second , my friend 's wedding ring was almost red-hot , and only a fast reaction with his other hand to break the connection by hitting the wrench prevented it from remaining connected long enough to melt . The ring had to be sawed off his finger at the emergency room , and it was more than a month before the burn specialist was sure he would n't lose the finger altogether . Two lessons here . First , remove all jewelry when working with tools , even something as simple as a box wrench . That 's fairly obvious , eh ? Second , always remove the battery 's ground clamp before loosening the positive . If you remove the negative clamp and inadvertently complete a circuit to ground , there will be no current flow because the ground clamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ground will then produce no current flow because the current has no return path to the negative post . And , of course , always reconnect the ground last . Cold Logic ? Q. My dad was a mechanic and instilled in me that I should never start and then turn off an engine without getting the temperature gauge to at least register some heat . This is to keep totally cold oil from clogging up the pistons . However , my service manager says this does n't apply to newer engines . What say you ? A. Unheated oil ? Clogging up the pistons ? Where do these things get started , anyway ? From the top : Shutting down an engine that has n't reached operating temp will have zero short-term effect . As far as warming up an engine before driving away , that old nugget no longer applies because modern engines have better lubrication , tighter clearances and , in general , are more resistant to sludge formation . Start the motor , buckle your seatbelt , adjust the mirrors and drive off at normal speeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to warm up an engine thoroughly : Low-temperature running is rich running , and will cause unburned fuel , water and acids to collect in the crankcase . A few weeks of being driven only to the corner for groceries or to the train station for commuting to work , and these contaminants will build up , ultimately turning to sludge . So every engine needs to be driven for a half-hour or so after it has warmed up to boil off the gruel and water . But doing that once or twice a month is plenty . It 's not necessary to come to full operating temp every single time you drive . Starting it for a few seconds and then shutting it off is probably less harmful than starting it and letting it partly warm up , as your dad suggests . Them 's the Brakes Q. I have a problem with the ABS in my 1992 Buick Park Avenue . One day as I was driving , the car just started to slow down all by itself . After a lot of looking and trial and error , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My question is , since I unplugged the sensor do I still have all-wheel braking ? A. If your ABS ( or at least the system on your Buick ) packs up , you 'll still have brakes on all four wheels , but without the benefit of the antilock feature . On most vehicles , this is not an issue , but on some  --  notably pickup trucks  --  this can lead to lack of stability under heavy braking as the rear brakes lock up early . If unplugging the sensor makes your problem go away , do n't be fooled . You 've simply disabled the entire ABS , masking the symptoms . The sensor can be checked for proper function without replacing it . I suggest you get a mechanic who has a scan tool to check for trouble codes and a good multimeter to check that sensor , because it does n't sound like you 're ready to tackle this on your own . Something in the ABS is making that wheel brake by itself , so get it fixed soon . Do n't Be Yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe they help me see better at night , especially when it rains . I live in Washington state , the land of rain and fog . However , one of my friends who has the same yellow lights has been pulled over by local authorities and warned to remove the yellow lights . If we can have yellow foglights , why ca n't we have yellow headlights ? A. The federal Department of Transportation , which sets all motor vehicle regulations , requires that all new cars sold in the United States have white headlights . It does not prohibit you from changing them on your own . However , state motor vehicle ordinances almost always prohibit using any colored headlamps on the road . Only the French persisted in requiring yellow headlamps , at least until they joined the European Union and standardized their traffic laws to match the rest of Europe . Odds are that , if they have n't already , local law enforcement professionals will be pulling you over and telling you that your headlamps are illegal . If you absolutely must see yellow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel increase contrast in foggy conditions . PM YOU NEED THIS POCKET IR THERMOMETER Hot , hot , hot . Or not . We 've got a couple of infrared thermometers around the shop , and they 're great for checking tire temperatures , trailer bearings , brakes , whatever , on your car or truck . We even use them to check the hot oil when we fry turkeys ( 350 F is perfect ) . But they 've been bulky  --  and pricey . This miniature IR thermometer from Actron ( $50 ) is small enough and inexpensive enough to carry around in the glovebox. actron.com  --  M.A. Photograph : Use an IR thermometer to check the radiator , brakes , a/c or whatever on your car , or around the house .
