<p> Everyone claimed victory last week in the wake of the USGA and Royal &; Ancient Golf Club finally reaching accord on the springlike-effect issue . <p> PGA Tour commissioner Tim Finchem was happy the rule was unified , a necessity in today 's international game ( see the tour 's last two winners ) . Course owners and club officials were happy a stand was taken against the distance explosion that 's forcing constant renovations . And equipment manufacturers were happy they got the two sets of rules they have proposed for years . <p> But the big winner was clearly the USGA  --  if it stands firm in the principles it outlined . <p> The USGA got the R &A; to accept its limit on the springlike effect of drivers for high-level tournament play , effective next year . And the same limit will apply to recreational players  --  at least those who abide by the Rules of Golf  --  beginning in 2008 . <p> Yes , there will be different rules for elite players and average hackers over a five-year span , but the manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shown that most recreational players want to play by the same rules , and with the same equipment , as the pros . And how many people are going to shell out hundreds of dollars for a hot driver that will be nonconforming again in a few years ? <p> Even more important than resolving the driver issue , was the joint statement of principles " released by the USGA and R &A; regarding future technological advances . <p> The governing bodies believe that golf balls , when hit by highly skilled golfers , should not fly significantly further than they do today , " the statement said . Any further significant increases ... are undesirable . " <p> It went on to say the two ruling bodies will seek ways of protecting the game " against such increases in distance , even if they are caused by improved athleticism , coaching or course conditioning and not by technology . <p> In other words , a brake or even a rollback on the performance of the golf ball  --  the real culprit behind the power surge , more than the drivers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ USGA must be willing to put its money  --  and its lawyers  --  where its mouth is . Manufacturers are sure to squawk whenever the USGA and R &A; reach agreement on new ball-testing measures , as well as limits on clubhead size and shaft length . <p> The USGA has deep coffers with which to fight any potential lawsuits and a seemingly solid case . After all , no one is keeping companies from selling nonconforming clubs or balls . The USGA and R &A; merely establish a set of rules that anyone , the PGA Tour included , can choose to accept or ignore . <p> When push comes to sue , however , the USGA ca n't back down in the face of manufacturers ' threats . <p> The future of the game depends on it . <p> DOUBLE BOOKING : Officials of the Byron Nelson Classic might be rooting against Tiger Woods this week in the Deutsche Bank Open . This is the fourth straight year Woods has played in Germany the week after the Nelson , but the dates of the two tournaments might conflict in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , N.C. , will push the Nelson back a week next year . The European tour has not announced its 2003 schedule , but if the Deutsche Bank keeps its dates , Woods will have a decision to make . Because of his respect for tournament host Byron Nelson , it 's unlikely he would choose the German event  --  unless he 's the defending champion . <p> I really enjoy this tournament , " Woods said last week of the Nelson , in which he finished third . He would be a hard guy to say no to . " <p> MONTY 'S MISHAPS : Colin Montgomerie picked up his first top-10 of the season last week with a tie for third at the Belfry , but once again , it did n't come without controversy . <p> Montgomerie came to the 18th tee Sunday tied for the lead . Just as he was starting his downswing , the public- address man at the 18th green announced Nick Faldo 's arrival . Montgomerie pushed his tee shot into the right rough , made a bogey and eventually lost by two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , and everyone else was quiet apart from the announcer , " said Montgomerie , who planned to lodge a complaint with the European tour . <p> Montgomerie also might have caused some discord within the European Ryder Cup ranks when he hired Andy Prodger to replace his longtime caddie , Alistair McLean . Prodger , who will be on Montgomerie 's bag this week in Germany , still was working for Welshman Phillip Price . Price learned of the defection through the media Friday , then dismissed Prodger for the final two rounds . <p> I have to play with Monty in the Ryder Cup , so I do n't want to sour any relationships , " Price told Reuters , but this should have been handled better .

The Spanish sensation won his first PGA Tour title last year at Colonial , overtaking 2000 winner Phil Mickelson with a final-round 63 . <p> Though the last two winners were big hitters , the list of champions at the tight Colonial layout is filled with short-but-straight hitters such as Corey Pavin and Ben Crenshaw . In fact , Garcia hit mostly irons off the tee last year en route to victory . <p> ONES TO WATCH <p> JUSTIN LEONARD <p> Like Harbour Town , where Leonard won last month , Colonial places more of a premium on accuracy than distance . That 's good news for Leonard , who ranks eighth on the tour in driving accuracy . He also tends to play well in his home state , including a tie for fifth in this event last year . <p> TOM LEHMAN <p> Colonial rewards strong iron players like Lehman , who has thrived on Perry Maxwell designs .
