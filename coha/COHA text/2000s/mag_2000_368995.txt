A diagnosis of pancreatic cancer would be devastating to any of us , bringing with it the horrors of debilitating chemotherapy and a slim chance of surviving the next five years . Fifteen years from now , however , you might not even bat an eye at the news . Your doctor will simply hand you a capsule packed with millions of sensors , each programmed to seek out and kill the cancer cells in your body . A few weeks and a dozen doses later , your tumors will be gone  --  destroyed while you were going about your daily routine . <P> This is n't science fiction . The National Cancer Institute and NASA plan to spend $12 million a year for the next three years to develop nanosensors  --  devices less than one-thousandth the diameter of a human hair  --  that will scan the body for the molecular signatures of cancer  --  the aberrant proteins found on malignant cells , for instance  --  and map the locations and shapes of tumors . If engineered to carry drugs or genes , the sensors could treat cancers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving healthy ones unharmed . The result : an end to the pharmaceutical carpet bombing we call chemotherapy , not to mention its attendant miseries . <P> And that 's not all . One day , autonomous " nanobots " far smaller than motes of dust will patrol the body , repairing aging organs and fixing genetic damage before it can turn into disease . But nanomedicine is still in its infancy , cautions Carol Dahl , co-director of the NCI/NASA collaboration . " Most of the work we 're seeing out there right now asks , What are the widgets we can build ? Next , the question will be , How can we apply them to solve specific problems ? " Mihail Roco , adviser to the National Science Foundation 's $150 million nanotechnology initiative , believes we will have an answer soon enough . He predicts that the rudiments of nanotechnology will aid the manufacture and design of up to half of all drugs by the end of this decade . <P>  --  By Unmesh Kher             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
