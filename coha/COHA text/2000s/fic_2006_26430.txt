Barista Boy Sex in a cup Ca n't you ask me out Instead of " Wassup ? " " Barista Boy " Written by Heather Wells The guy behind the counter is checking me out . No , really . He 's hot , too . Well , in a twenty-year-old barista kind of way . I bet he plays the guitar . I bet he stays up way too late at night , strumming , the way I do . I can tell by the slight shadows under his long-lashed green eyes , and the way his curly blond hair is sticking up in spikes all over his head . Bed head . No time to shower before work , because he was up so late practicing . Just like me . " What 'll it be ? " he asks me . But with a look . A look that definitely says , I 'm checking you out . I know I 'm the one he 's checking out because there 's no one in line behind me . Well , and why should n't he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the parts of me you can see through my bulky winter outerwear , anyway . I fully put on mascara and cover-up this morning ( unlike Barista Boy , I like to disguise my undereye circles ) . And what with my parka , you ca n't see the four -- well , okay , ten -- pounds I put on over the holidays . Because who counts calories when it 's Christmas ? Or New Year 's ? Or after New Year 's , when all that Christmas candy is on sale ? There 's plenty of time to get in shape again for bikini season . And , okay , I 've been telling myself that for the past five or six years , and I still have n't actually tried it yet -- getting in shape for bikini season , I mean . But who knows ? Maybe this year . I have two days of vacation due to me , all I 've accrued since passing my employment probationary period in October . I could go to Cancn . And , okay , just for the weekend . But still . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Barista Boy ? I 've still got it . Obviously . " Grande caf mocha , please , " I say . I 'm totally not into foamy drinks with whipped cream on top of them , but it 's the first official day of spring semester ( spring ! Right ! ) , and it 's really cold out and supposed to blizzard later , and Cooper left this morning ( for destinations unknown , as usual ) without turning on the coffeemaker , and my dog Lucy would n't go out because it was so cold , so I 'll probably find a nice surprise from her when I get home , and I really need a little pick-me-up to help me quit feeling so sorry for myself . Plus , you know , as long as I 'm blowing five bucks on a cup of coffee , I might as well go for the gold . " One grande caf mocha , coming up , " Barista Boy says , doing one of those flippy things with my cup . You know , twirling it , like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ western . Oh , yeah . He definitely plays guitar . I wonder if he sits around writing songs he can never work up the guts actually to perform , like me ? I wonder if he 's constantly second-guessing his songwriting talent , like I am ? No . He 's got the guts to get up in front of a crowd with a guitar and his own lyrics . I mean , just look at him . " Soy or nonfat ? " he asks . Oh , God . I ca n't face my first day back to work after break on nonfat milk . And soy ? Soy ? " Whole milk , please , " I say . I 'll be good later . At lunch I 'll just have a chicken parm and a salad , and maybe just a bite of lo-cal frozen yogurt . . . . Mmmm , unless Magda got in more Dove Bars . . . . " You know , " Barista Boy says , as he rings me up , " you look really familiar . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasure . He remembers me ! He must see hundreds , maybe thousands of caffeine-starved New Yorkers a day , but he remembers me ! Fortunately it 's so cold outside , and so warm in here , my red cheeks could easily be taken for the fact that I 'm overheating in my coat , and not that I 'm kvelling over his remembering me . " Well , I live and work in the neighborhood , " I say . " I 'm in here all the time . " Which is n't strictly true , since I 'm keeping to a pretty tight budget ( due to my pitiful salary ) , which foamy coffee drinks are definitely not part of , since I can get free coffee anytime I want from the cafeteria . They just do n't have mocha syrup in them . Or whipped cream . We tried to keep whipped cream canisters in the caf , but people kept swiping them in order to do whip-its . " No , " Barista Boy says , shaking his lusciously shaggy head . " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you look a lot like Heather Wells ? " I take my drink from him . This , of course , is always the tricky part . What do I say ? Yes , actually . . . because I am Heather Wells , and then run the risk of him asking me out simply because he thinks I still have connections in the music industry ( so not . See above , re : fear of being booed off the stage ) ? Or do I just laugh and say , Why , no ? Because then what happens later , after we start dating , and he finds out I am Heather Wells ? I mean , I could probably keep it a secret for a little while , but eventually he 's going to find out my real name . Like when we 're in Customs coming back from Cancn . Or when we 're signing the marriage certificate . . . . So I settle for saying , " Really ? " " Sure . Well , if you were thinner , " Barista Boy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Have a good one ! " What I ca n't believe is how the entire city can be gearing up for a predicted snowstorm -- I mean , trucks filled with salt and sand can be lumbering down Tenth Street , breaking off tree limbs as they go by ; the grocery stores can have already sold out of bread and milk ; the television can show nothing but Storm Watch updates -- and still , the drug dealers are out in full force in and around Washington Square Park .
