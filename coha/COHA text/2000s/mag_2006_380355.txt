Not since the doomed Robert Bork has there been a Supreme Court nominee with such a clear record of opposition to abortion . And yet , as Samuel Alito moves closer to Senate confirmation this week , the rumble that many expected over his position on the issue has failed to materialize . That in itself tells us something about the nature of the abortion wars today . <P> Listening just to the alarms of abortion-rights groups on the one hand and the cheers of opponents on the other , you could come away with the impression that the fate of Alito 's nomination will determine whether abortion remains available in this country . That is not what is at stake . Alito 's confirmation would not produce the votes sufficient to overturn the Supreme Court 's landmark Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing abortion rights throughout the country . And even if Roe is reversed in the future , states will be free to preserve abortion rights , and many almost surely will . Today the tussle is over not whether abortion will exist but how . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with the public 's attitude toward the issue : polls consistently show that most people in the U.S. want abortion to be legal ; they just do n't want it to be easy . <P> That sentiment has been expressed in a variety of measures passed by legislatures since a 1989 Supreme Court ruling gave states more leeway to restrict abortion . It 's a reality the Supreme Court reaffirmed just last week . In a narrowly written but unanimous decision authored by Sandra Day O'Connor , the high court backed away from directly interfering with a New Hampshire law . The Justices said a lower court should not have struck down a parental-notification requirement entirely , and ordered the judges to come up with a more limited version that would protect the health of girls seeking abortions in emergency situations . <P> On the eve of the 33rd anniversary of Roe v. Wade , TIME took a look at the situation in the state of Missouri , where the 1989 case originated , to explore how the shifting battlefield affects the making of abortion law and to examine the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pregnant . <P> Consider , for example , the case of a 22-year-old unmarried woman we will call Lisa , who missed her period last November . Lisa , who was managing a restaurant , decided to have an abortion . Her timing could have been better . Just the month before , Springfield 's only abortion provider , which had been operating five days a week just 15 minutes from her home , closed its doors . " The environment here in Missouri is so hostile , " its administrator told the local paper . With four abortion doctors left in the state , compared with 10 as recently as 1996 , Lisa 's closest alternative turned out to be the Planned Parenthood clinic in St. Louis , an eight-hour round trip by car . That meant Lisa , who has no car , not only had to ask a friend to drive her but also had to come up with an excuse for missing two days of work , because she was afraid to tell her boss the truth . Two weeks later , she had to make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five minutes . She figures the whole episode  --  the clinic 's bill , the prescription for the abortion drug mifepristone , gasoline , food and incidentals  --  cost her a little more than $600 . " It was all very frustrating , " Lisa told TIME a month after her abortion . " I only recently paid back everyone I borrowed money from . "
