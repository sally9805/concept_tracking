<p> Seeking more info <p> Re : ' Physicians : Tonic that sickened 4 teens unsafe ; ' Green Hornet ' concoction likened to banned ephedra , ' Feb. 17 news story . <p> Your article addressed an important safety concern but failed to truly inform the public of the danger of ' herbal concoctions ' like Green Hornet . Those ingredients ( vitamins , guarana , ginseng , caffeine , ' wild berry extract , ' etc. ) are common in many herbal juice drinks that can be found on the shelves of any grocery store . My family enjoys drinking them and has experienced no harmful effects ; in fact , we believed them to be healthy . However , the article implies that such drinks may be harmful , since they have similar ingredients to the Green Hornet drink . <p> How about a more factual piece that lets the public know what exactly is dangerous in these drinks ? Is there one ingredient in particular that is dangerous , or is the combination of herbal ingredients what makes it dangerous ? Am I and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> After reading your article , I was alarmed but not very well-informed . A follow-up article with some facts about herbal drinks - the benefits and the dangers - would be much appreciated . <p> R. FREEMAN <p> Golden <p> Relying on religion <p> Re : ' Marriage , San Francisco-style , ' Feb. 18 Al Knight column . <p> I wonder what rock Al Knight has been living under . He writes , ' Activists for homosexuals have been very busy lately selling the American public a phony bill of goods : that lesbians and gay men are the target of discrimination akin to that once suffered by blacks under Jim Crow laws . ' <p> He also wrote , ' This preposterous view has led to some absurd claims . For example , the decision by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples last week has been compared to restaurant sit-ins during the 1960s fight over civil-rights legislation . ' <p> What ? He does n't see it ? The blacks were discriminated against because they were black . Women have been discriminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex ' is discriminated against simply because of who we love . Just as blacks and women have no choice in who they are , neither do we . <p> Why is marriage solely for one man and one woman ? Because that 's what the Bible tells us . Why do we depend on the Bible for our daily lives ? Do we not have the ability to think for ourselves ? There are people out there who have never heard of the Father , Son and Holy Spirit , let alone the Word of God . Yet , is n't it funny how they have the same high standards as most other peoples ? <p> This is the greatest country on the planet . It has so many diverse peoples and beliefs and religions - or lack of religions . If you choose to use the Bible for the welfare of this country , then , by God , put all those who have committed adultery to death : ' If a man commits adultery with another man 's wife a both the adulterer and the adulteress must be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have got to stop allowing the religious right from determining what our government stands for . <p> JOE TENACE <p> Arvada <p> Correction of fact <p> Al Knight writes , ' The California Constitution contains a provision , approved by the voters , that restricts marriage in that state to the union of a man and a woman . ' <p> The California Constitution contains no such provision , approved by the voters or anyone else . Knight must be thinking of Proposition 22 , which passed by with about 60 percent of the vote in 2000 and said California would only recognize marriage as between a man and a woman . This has become section 308.5 of the California family code . Section 308 deals with marriages from foreign entities and other jurisdictions . <p> This is a not a trivial difference - the Constitution trumps laws , even those passed by a majority of the voters . <p> WARREN LATHE <p> San Francisco <p> Starbucks not welcome <p> Re : ' Saying the ' S ' - word on East Colfax ; Starbucks chain finds surprising welcome among denizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> While I can respect and understand the optimism felt by some East Colfax business owners at the arrival of Starbucks in our neighborhood , I simply can not share their joy . My family roots in this neighborhood go back some 80 years . This neighborhood is special and unique , with its diverse mix of locally owned small businesses . I have to wonder if the presence of a corporate monster like Starbucks is really necessary for growth in this already-evolving neighborhood . <p> I relish my frequent walks down Colfax , taking in the feel of the neighborhoods that are anchored by this fantastic avenue . That big green-and-white sign is a touch of sterile suburbia intruding in the eclectic beauty that is my East Colfax , and I can not bring myself to welcome its arrival . <p> MARIA HANNON <p> Denver <p> Do n't bury news of soldiers inside newspaper <p> After weeks of front-page overkill on the sexual assault allegations against the University of Colorado athletic department , your newspaper continues to show its true colors with the news stories featured most prominently in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feature story , ' The hardest labor , ' which was followed by two full pages of in-depth , unnecessary commentary and too many more pictures . <p> The Denver &; the West cover featured an article headlined ' 2,000 rally for gay marriage , ' with your ' fair and balanced ' mayor coming out to support same-sex marriage . <p> Then , finally , some meaningful news , buried inside : ' Ft . Carson awash in tears of reunion , separation ; 185 GIs return from Iraq as 475 prepare to ship out . ' <p> In my newspaper , these American heroes from Fort Carson , not pregnant prisoners , would have received front-page coverage . Do you really consider another gay rally more important than the return of our troops , who have been protecting our right to rally ? <p> RICHARD D. DORAN <p> Parachute <p> Rocky Flats still needs citizen oversight <p> Re : ' Keep close eye on Rocky Flats , ' Feb. 12 editorial . <p> The Post warns the federal government that it may be breaking promises to Colorado by curtailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While few would deny that the coalition has been effective over the last several years , the Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board , now in its 11th year , also has made substantial contributions to citizen-based oversight of the cleanup activities at Rocky Flats . <p> This board was chartered in 1993 by the Department of Energy under the Federal Advisory Committee Act to provide recommendations to the DOE and the regulatory agencies on the cleanup of Rocky Flats . While maintaining a diverse membership representing differing points of view on the cleanup , the board has advised the DOE by producing more than 100 consensus recommendations in the past decade . <p> Unfortunately , our work also is in jeopardy . The DOE reduced our budget this year by 50 percent and has said it will reduce it by a similar amount next year . In response , we have reduced our staff by 50 percent , given up our leased office space and made other changes . With further cuts , however , it will be extremely difficult , if not impossible , to continue providing advice from local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am not suggesting we are more effective than the regional governmental coalition . I am also not asking for additional money . What does concern me is that after many years of close and effective public oversight of Rocky Flats , now that it is closing , public participation is ending . Because Rocky Flats will not be a pristine site after it closes , the citizens of Colorado will need to continue their oversight of Rocky Flats well into the future . I would hate for there to be competition for the few remaining dollars . What is needed is community consensus on what type of public participation should continue . This participation should include both local government and public stakeholders . <p> When we began our work in 1993 , Rocky Flats enjoyed very little credibility with the public . In the past 11 years , the site has shown great improvement in this area by welcoming and supporting citizen oversight . Now is not the time for the federal government to reverse its course . <p> VICTOR HOLM , Chair <p> Rocky Flats Citizens Advisory Board <p> Lakewood
