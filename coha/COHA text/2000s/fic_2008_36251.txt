As Dan neared the top of the Sepulveda Pass , he saw the barricade the Westside had built across the 405 . His deerskin boots scuffed on the old , cracked , sun- faded asphalt . Weeds , even bushes , sprouted from the cracks , but the freeway was still the best route south from the Valley . Or it had been , till the Westsiders blocked it . <br> They saw the Valley war party coming . Horns blared an alert . Men ran back and forth behind the barrier . Some of them would have crossbows or longbows . At seventeen , Dan himself was only an archer . Others would carry modern smoothbore muskets . And a few would use Old Time rifles . Those were far better than anything people could make nowadays , 130 years after the Fire came down . But the ammunition was two lifetimes old , too . Sometimes it worked the way it was supposed to . Sometimes it did n't do anything . And sometimes it blew up . You needed to be several different kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kevin raised the truce flag . He had n't brought along enough men to rush the barricade . He could n't have come without a good escort , though , not unless he wanted to lose face . The game had rules . <br> Big Louie strode out in front of the flag . He had an even bigger voice . " Parley ! " he bellowed . " We want to talk ! " He stepped back , looking proud of himself . <br> A Westside herald shouted back : " Come ahead , with no more than ten ! " His voice sounded thin after Big Louie 's . The Valley man looked prouder than ever . <br> Captain Kevin chose two riflemen , four musketeers , and four archers . You had to have some of each . That was what democracy was all about . He pointed to Dan as the last archer . Having a youngster among the veterans helped show he was n't scared . <br> The barricade looked stronger than first reports suggested . The Westsiders must have worked hard to make it taller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was summer , and hot and dry . Sweat ran down under his broad- brimmed hat . Turkey vultures circled overhead . <br> Once upon a time , men had flown , too . They could still get gliders into the air , but it was n't the same . They 'd really flown in the Old Time  --  flown at peace , flown to war . The songs and the old books all said so . And everybody knew the Fire came down from the sky . <br> " Close enough ! " a Westside officer yelled . <br> " That you , Morris ? " Captain Kevin called . <br> " Colonel Morris , if you please ! " Like most of his kind , the Westsider sounded snooty . Dan thought of things that way , anyhow . Westsiders said Valley people were a bunch of hicks . To Dan , that only proved how dumb Westsiders were . <br> " Well , Colonel Morris , your Wonderfulness , you can tear down this wall , " Captain Kevin said . " King Zev and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have a treaty to keep the pass open , and you people are breaking it . We wo n't put up with that . We know our rights , we do . " <br> Better believe it , Dan thought . The barricade would cut the Valley off from trade , and from scrounging farther south . If you did n't scrounge , how were you supposed to keep going ? So much the Old Time made was better than its modern equivalents : everything from coins to mirrors to guns . People had scrounged a lot and time had ruined a lot , but not everything . There were n't that many people any more , and there 'd been even fewer right after the Fire came down . <br> " Times , they are a-changing , " Colonel Morris said . " We 've got some things of our own going on . If you want to come south , you 'll have to pay to pass . " <br> " That 's simple . We wo n't do it . And if you think you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared . <br> " Who wants to come north ? " the Westsider said scornfully . <br> " Good luck with your oranges . Good luck with your greens . Good luck with your grain , " Captain Kevin told him . <br> " You need us worse than we need you , " Colonel Morris replied . Westsiders always said that . Maybe it was even true back before the Fire fell . Not many Valley people thought it was any more . The way things were going , it looked as if both sides would find out what was really what before too long . They 'd find out the hard way , too . <br> Captain Kevin scowled . " You wo n't get away with this . I can tell you that right now . We know what our rights are . If we have to , we 'll go to war to make sure the pass stays open . And if we go to war , we 'll win it . " <br> " That 's telling him , " Dan muttered . The musketeer next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colonel Morris did n't sound worried . Did that mean he really was n't , or did it just mean he was a good liar ? Most Westsiders were  --  Valley people thought so , anyhow . <br> " That 's your last word ? " Captain Kevin , by contrast , sounded sad and mad at the same time . <br> " That 's my first , last , and only word , " the Westside commander said . <br> " Well , I 'm sorry for you , but you 'll be sorrier . " Captain Kevin nodded to his soldiers . " Come on , boys . If they 're going to be dumb , we 'll teach ' em a lesson . " The soldiers turned around and marched back toward the rest of the Valley company . Behind them , the Westsiders jeered and swore . Dan got an itchy spot right in the middle of his back . If they started shooting , his leather jerkin would n't keep out an arrow , much less a bullet . <br> But they did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of arrow and musket range . Oh , a rifleman could still hit him , but riflemen would go after important targets first . A kid with a bow was no big deal . <br> " What 's the word , sir ? " a waiting Valley sergeant asked . <br> " War ! " Captain Kevin answered . Liz Mendoza hated this Los Angeles . Being here , working here , was like being best friends with one identical twin and then suddenly having to visit the other one in the intensive-care unit . In the home timeline , where she lived , Los Angeles was one of the great cities of the world . Even a hundred years ago , back in the twentieth century , people said the future happened here first . And they were right . <br> This Los Angeles had been much like that one up till 1967 . Then , in this alternate , somebody got stupid . People in what was left of the USA said the Russians fired the first missile . People in what was left of the USSR said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Both sides had fired way too many . <br> Quite a few alternates went through nuclear wars in the second half of the twentieth century or the first half of the twenty- first . Crosstime Traffic stayed away from most of them . The company that controlled trade between the home timeline and the worlds that happened when history changed did n't see much profit in dealing with them . Why would you want to do business with somebody who 'd set his own house and car on fire and then jumped into the flames ? <br> Here , though , UCLA was paying the freight . Indirectly , the government was . The university had got a grant to try to find out just what went wrong in this alternate . Liz 's father was one of the historians who 'd come here to do research . Her mother was a doctor who specialized in genetic diseases and the effects of radiation . And Liz was <br> Protective coloration , she thought . Her parents seemed more normal if they had a kid along . And so here she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1960s than she would have otherwise . It was , in the ancient slang of the day , a mindblowing experience . Except that slang was n't ancient here . People still used it . They used what ever they could from the days before the war , because they mostly could n't match that stuff , whether material goods or language , any more . Sad , but that was how things were in this alternate . <br> She 'd start UCLA herself a year later than she would have otherwise . But she 'd start with a year of crosstime experience under her belt . That was good . Or it would have been good if she 'd gone to an alternate more different than this one was . <br> The house where she and her folks stayed was in Westwood Village , a couple of blocks south of the UCLA campus . It was made from the rubble of the stores and apartments that had stood there when the bombs fell . The house was built around a central courtyard . The style came from Rome through Spain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade , and worked well in the California climate . <br> The windows that looked out on the world were small and barred . Liz could see the UCLA campus through the northfacing ones . She could , yes , but she did n't look that way very often . It hurt too much . Most of the big hospital buildings at the south end of campus never got built in this alternate . The war took care of that , as it took care of so many other things . The buildings that did survive were in sad disrepair . Some of the earlier ones , built before there were any earthquake codes , had crumbled in one shaker or another . <br> Somebody banged on the big brass knocker bolted to the front door . " You want to get that , Liz ? " her father called . <br> Well , no , not really , was the first thing that crossed her mind . But that was the wrong answer , and she knew it . " Okay , " she said out loud , and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she looked through the little window set above the knocker . The Westsiders patrolled Westwood Village pretty well , but robber bands still skulked in other ruins and came out to raid every now and then . There were freelance thieves , too . <br> She relaxed when she recognized the man standing in the street . Unbarring the door , she said , " Come in , Colonel Morris . " <br> " Thank you , Missy , " the Westsider said . In the home timeline , that would have made Liz want to spit in his eye . Here , he was just being polite . His English sounded old-fashioned to her . The language here had n't changed as much since 1967 as it had in the home timeline . <br> " Dad ! " she yelled . " It 's Colonel Morris ! " <br> " Be right there , " her father said . <br> " Hello , Jeff . How are you doing ? " Colonel Morris said when Liz 's father came to the door . <br> " Not too bad . Yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important Westsider . When Colonel Morris took it , his clasp also locked thumbs with Liz 's father . Handshakes like that were an ancient joke in the home timeline . They hung on here . <br> Both men wore baggy wool trousers tucked into boots and equally baggy linen shirts . Colonel Morris used a wide leather belt with a fat , fancy brass buckle . He wore an Old Time windup wristwatch on a broad leather band . Westsiders could n't make anything that fine , but they could keep some that were already made running . <br> Dad 's belt looked like the colonel 's . Some styles here still reflected the ones in fashion when the Fire fell . So did some of the language . Some things had changed , though . Liz 's wool skirt reached to the ground . Minis were scandalous . Her shirt was like the men 's . It even buttoned the same way , which drove her crazy . <br> " Liz , why do n't you get us some improved water ? " her father said . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women around here a lot more than they did in the home timeline . Women mostly put up with it . The ones who did n't got thumped , and nobody said a thing except that they had it coming . The people who went on and on about how enlightened the Westside was were all men . <br> Liz poured water from a big earthenware jug into two earthenware mugs . With the aqueducts gone , water was always the biggest worry in this Los Angeles . She added one part strong brandy to about five of water . The brandy was what improved it , not because the booze got you drunk  --  brandy did that much faster by itself  --  but because it killed enough germs to keep you from getting the runs . <br> She politely served the guest first : " Here you are , Colonel . " <br> " Groovy , sweetheart , " he said , and she did n't crack a smile . If somebody in 1967 had heard someone else say Bully , by jingo ! , it would have sounded just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " her father said when she gave him his water . You did n't have to talk like a hippie here . You did n't have to , no  --  but you could . Dad turned back to Colonel Morris . " What can I do for you , sir ? " <br> " You 'll have heard it 's probably war with the Valley ? " <br> " I 've heard it . I hoped it was n't true , " Dad answered . <br> " Well , it is , " Colonel Morris said . " We 're going to collect a toll at the top of the pass , and they do n't like it . I hope we 'll be able to buy some more of those fine muskets and revolvers you sell . They 're the next best thing to Old Time guns . " <br> " I 'll see what I can do , " Liz 's father said . As far as anyone here knew , the guns he sold came up from a cousin 's shop in Sandago . They really came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trade goods in several low-tech alternates . Dad went on , " Do you really need the toll enough to fight to keep it ? " <br> " The City Council says we do . " The City Council was the band of nine nobles who ran things in the Westside . The title made it sound as if they were elected , but they were n't . A lot of names from the days before the war hung on , even if they pointed to different things now . Colonel Morris added , " I 'm loyal to the Council and obey its orders , of course . " <br> " Of course . " Dad did n't even sound sarcastic . The Westside officer had to say stuff like that . The City Council 's spies were everywhere . Colonel Morris could n't know Dad was n't one of them . <br> " Do you really have to follow orders even when they 're dumb ? " Liz asked . <br> Colonel Morris blinked . Dad sent her a look that said she 'd got out of line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For that matter , nobody in the Westside was supposed to . <br> " That 's a heavy question , sweetie , " Colonel Morris said , by which he meant it was important . When he said sweetie , he meant Liz was n't . She was only a girl , somebody he could patronize . She wanted to pick up a chair and clout him over the head with it . Maybe that would knock sense into him . Or maybe not . <br> Instead , she smiled  --  sweetly  --  and said , " Well , have you got an answer for it ? " <br> Dad coughed . She was n't supposed to push like this . She did n't much care , not when the Westsider insulted her without even knowing he was doing it . <br> " I have the only answer I need , " Colonel Morris said . " What ever the City Council tells me to do , I do it . " <br> I 'm just following orders . How many people in how many alternates said the same thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Too much  --  Liz knew that . <br> " How long will we have to wait for the guns ? " the colonel asked Liz 's father . He tried to ignore her now . Was that better than patronizing her ? Was it worse ? Was it as bad in a different way ? <br> " It 'll be a while , sir , " Jeff Mendoza answered . " Long way down to Sandago . " It was n't even two hundred kilometers . If traffic on the 405 was n't bad , you could get to San Diego in a couple of hours . You could in the home timeline , anyhow . If you were traveling in a horse- drawn wagon in this alternate , the town with the rubbed-down name was more like a week away . <br> " Well , do what you can , " Colonel Morris said . " We need those guns , especially the six- shooters . See you later . " He sketched a salute to Dad , nodded to Liz , and left . <br> After the door was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " You ca n't poke him with a pin whenever you feel like it , you know . " <br> " I guess not , " she said . " But he ticked me off . " <br> " He did n't even realize he was doing it . " <br> " That 's the point , " Liz said . " I sure knew . " <br> " What am I going to do with you ? " Her father sounded half annoyed , half amused . <br> " Send me home . I do n't like it here very much , " Liz answered . " Or if you ca n't do that , let me go up to the campus . " <br> " You know we wo n't send you home . You know you do n't really want to go home , too . " Now Dad donned patience like a suit of armor . The most annoying thing was , he was right . She wanted the year of crosstime ser vice on her college applications , even if she did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Sending you up to UCLA was n't so simple , either . What we had to pay to get you a stack pass . . . " <br> Liz sighed . " What is simple ? " <br> Her father gave her a hug . " Welcome to the world , sweetheart . " <br> " Groovy , " she said , as sardonically as she could . He only laughed . Along with the rest of Captain Kevin 's men , Dan marched back to the barracks in the Sepulveda Basin . Piles and piles of sandbags were stacked close to the halls . Most of the time , the Sepulveda Basin was as dry as the rest of the Valley . But it could flood in a hurry when the rains came down . The sandbags had saved the barracks more than once over the years . <br> No rain now , not in the summertime . The Valley was full of cisterns to hold the rain that had fallen the winter before . Watermasters doled it out to farms and families . In years with dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for crops  --  and for people . <br> Back in the Old Time , irrigation had brought water from hundreds of miles away . Everybody in Los Angeles had had plenty . All the houses and apartments and factories and shops showed as much . There were far more of them than the people who lived here now could ever hope to fill . All over L.A. , in all the little countries that had sprung up since the day the Fire fell , scavengers scrounged through the swarms of abandoned buildings for what ever they could find . <br> Something occurred to Dan . " Hey , Sergeant ! " he said . If Sergeant Chuck did n't know everything , he did n't know he did n't know it . <br> " What is it , kid ? " The three stripes on his sleeve  --  genuine Old Time stripes , machine- embroidered  --  gave him the right to treat everybody below him the way Dan 's father treated him before he got drafted . <br> " Is it true what they say about swimming pools ? " <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fill those cement holes in the ground with water and swim in them ? They did n't just use ' em for cisterns or put dirt back in ' em ? " <br> " Yes , Sergeant . That 's what I mean . " Dan nodded . <br> " Oh , it 's true , all right . " Sergeant Chuck nodded , too , solemnly . " I 've seen pictures in Old Time magazines . " <br> That proved it , all right , unless . . . " Were they for-true magazines ? " <br> " Well , I sure think so , " the sergeant answered . " They had other things that sure are real  --  cars and things , you know . " <br> " Oh , yeah . " Dan nodded . You could n't not know about cars . Their rusting corpses filled the streets . To this day , they were the main source of iron for blacksmiths . Their wheels  --  with tires of wood , not the rubber that had rotted away  --  still turned on carts and wagons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day . " I wonder how they moved so fast all by themselves , though . " <br> " Well , who does n't ? " Chuck said . " Must 've been something like a steam engine , I expect . " <br> Big , puffing steam engines pumped water . A few of them moved engines along railroads . But so many rail lines were broken , and so many bandits prowled the routes , that railroads often seemed more trouble than they were worth . " How did Old Time people keep railroads from getting raided ? " Dan asked . <br> " I do n't think they did , " the sergeant told him . " You know the story of Jesse James and Annie Oakley , do n't you ? " <br> " Little Orphan Annie ? I hope I do ! " Dan said . <br> " Well , they were train robbers , right ? " <br> " They were , " Dan admitted . " But they got caught and paid the price . Jesse did , anyway . Annie married Judge Warbucks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even get caught . " <br> " Too many places for bad guys to slip through the cracks , " Sergeant Chuck said . " What you 've got to remember is , back in Old Time days this was all one country  --  the Valley and the Westside and Burbank and Speedro . All the way from Sandago to Frisco . Even Vegas . All one country . Bad guys could n't just skip over a border and disappear , like . " <br> " Uh- huh . " Dan had learned that in school . And there were big stretches of land now that did n't belong to anybody  --  except bandits and brigands , anyhow . " If people other places would just admit Zev was their rightful king . . . " <br> Chuck laughed . " Do n't hold your breath . The Westside wants the City Council to run everything . Burbank 's got a Director and a Producer . All the other countries think they ought to be top dog , too . " <br> " But they do n't know what they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Dan had learned that in school , too . <br> " Well , sure . " Chuck had probably also learned it in school . Most people in the Valley had four years of education . Quite a few had six or even eight . Dan did . He could read and write and add and subtract and even multiply and do long division . Adding and subtracting always came in handy . He did n't know if he 'd ever use the fancier stuff , but he had it if he needed it . <br> And reading . . . Nothing killed time better than reading . Back in the Old Time , they 'd had TV and the movies and radio and records to make time go by . A few records still played on wind-up phonographs . The other things were n't even memories any more , because nobody still alive recalled using them . But old people remembered their grandparents talking about them , and Old Time books and magazines mentioned them all the time . They had to be for-true . <br> Sergeant Chuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Dan , I 'd start practicing hard . A good archer 's worth about as much as a musketeer . " <br> " Do you think there 'll be a war , honest ? " Dan asked . <br> " Sure do , " the sergeant answered . " King Zev wo n't let the Westside close the pass . That 's too big a slap in the face to put up with . If those snooty so-and-so 's get away with it , next thing you know Burbank 'll start pushing us around , too . " <br> " It 's a good thing they put these barracks on Victory Boulevard , " Dan said . <br> " Yeah , that 's heavy , all right , " Chuck agreed . " Talk about your good omens . " <br> " Ca n't hardly get a better one , " Dan said . Some Old Time books seemed to laugh at the idea that anyone could foretell the future . But the Bible did n't . Whether you were Christian or Jewish , you had to believe in prophets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some printed before the Fire came down and others , cruder , afterwards . Dan snapped his fingers . " Talking about omens  --  can I ask you one more thing ? " <br> " Go ahead . " Sergeant Chuck was in a good mood  --  maybe he looked forward to a war with the Westside . <br> " Does King Zev really have a Magic Eight Ball to help tell him what to do ? " <br> " He does n't have just one  --  he 's got two , " Chuck declared . " My cousin 's a preacher 's assistant , and he knows stuff like that . " <br> " Two ? Wow ! Oh , wow ! " Dan had n't dreamt the Valley was so rich . <br> " You better believe it , " Chuck said . " And what he does is , he asks both of them the same question and then he sees how each one answers . If that 's not scientific , I do n't know what is . " <br> " Scientific . " Dan 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conjure with . And plenty of wizards and fortune-tellers did just that . " Well , if we do n't have the vitamins to beat the Westside with two Magic Eight Balls , I do n't know what else we 'd need . " <br> " Soldiers , " Sergeant Chuck told him . " What ever else you 've got , you always need soldiers . " Walking up Hilgard to the UCLA campus made Liz want to cry . It was like walking past the skeleton of a good friend . You knew who it was . If you tried , you could picture what the person  --  or the place  --  had looked like alive . But all you saw was death . <br> The asphalt was so old , it was nearer white than black . Here and there , it had washed out altogether . Cobblestones replaced a few stretches . Others were just dirt . Cracks seamed even intact asphalt , like the wrinkles on a great- grandmother 's face . <br> Cracks also marred the concrete of the sidewalk . Back in the home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and some nicely watered lawns across the street . Here , most of the imported plants in the gardens were dead , killed off by L.A. 's summer droughts . No one here had a lawn that was green in the summertime . There was no water to spare for such luxury . From November to March  --  in a wet year , to May  --  things were green . Any other time ? Brown . <br> Sorority houses and rich people 's homes stood across the street from the campus in the home timeline . Some of the buildings still stood here . A couple of the old sororities even had their Greek letters on the front wall . Nobody in this alternate seemed to know what they meant any more . <br> They were n't sorority houses and rich people 's homes any more , not here . Guards stood outside one of them  --  it was the Westside jail . Smoke poured from another one  --  it was a smithy and armory , and made a lot of the weapons the local army used . Several homes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from dead automobiles . Members of the City Council lived in those . As far as Liz was concerned , they took A man 's home is his castle too far . The rulers of the Westside did n't seem to take chances about how well loved they were . <br> Turning left onto the actual campus was both a relief and a bigger wound . Parts of the north end seemed hauntingly familiar . Everyone in the home timeline called Bunche Hall the Waffle because of the square windows in the south wall that stuck out from the brown stone surface . The building remained intact here , too . Only a few of the windows did , though . <br> There was also another difference  --  a subtler one  --  between the two versions of the same building . Down at the bottom of Bunche Hall in the home timeline , there was a bust of the diplomat , and his name , and the dates of his birth and death : 1904  --  1971 . Everything here was the same . . . except the date of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive when the war started , and after that nobody cared . The 1904  --  that remained seemed asymmetrical . The artisan who put it up had figured it would look fine once Bunche died . In the home timeline , he was right . <br> Liz wondered whether Ralph Bunche ever saw the building named for him . If he did , what did he think of the way that nameless artisan had laid things out ? Would n't it have seemed as if the man was just waiting for him to keel over ? It felt that way to Liz , anyhow . <br> Her goal lay beyond Bunche Hall and to the left as she came up from the south . In the home timeline , it was the Young Research Library  --  the YRL  --  named after a twentieth- century administrator . Here , it was the University Research Library , or URL . They had n't got around to naming it for the otherwise forgotten Young before the missiles started flying . <br> Five stories ' worth of books and periodicals . . . What better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this alternate ? The Westsiders had an almost superstitious respect for what they called Old Time knowledge . They took care of what the URL held as best they could . Most of it was still intact . <br> A guard outside the door nodded to Liz  --  she 'd been here before . He had an Old Time .45 on his hip  --  that was how important the Westsiders thought the URL was . Liz had sometimes wondered if computer URLs got their name from the University Research Library . That turned out not to be true  --  only an interesting coincidence . <br> Once upon a time , the plate- glass door by the guard station had been automatic . No more . No infrared beam to cut . No electricity to power the door even if there were a beam . Nothing but muscle power and fading memories . Liz pulled the door open and went in . <br> Her eyes needed a few seconds to get used to the gloom in the foyer . Some of the lamp fixtures in the ceiling still had fluorescent tubes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But no electricity had flowed through them since the Fire fell . The light inside the entrance hall came from the doorway and from the flickering oil lamps and candles . Soot caked thick on the walls above them said they 'd burned there for a long , long time . <br> In the home timeline , students  --  and other people who needed to find things they could n't track on the Net  --  would have bustled through the library and gathered in front of the elevators . Only a couple of people here wandered across the foyer . The elevators , of course , were as dead as the door and the fluorescent tubes . <br> If you wanted to go upstairs here , you literally had to go up the stairs . A stair dragon waited at the bottom . He called himself a librarian , but he was really a stair dragon . You had to placate him before you could go up , and he 'd search you when you came down again to make sure you were n't stealing books . <br> " Stack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He breathed smoke , too  --  he was puffing on a fat cigar . Liz thought he smelled gross . Tobacco was a popular crop and trade good here . And why not ? In this alternate , other things were likely to kill you before cancer or heart disease could . <br> To make sure he did n't start breathing fire , Liz showed him the family stack pass . It had cost her father a pretty penny in bribes , but good whiskey and wind-up alarm clocks and other goodies from the home timeline made getting what you wanted here pretty easy . <br> " Thank you . Go ahead . " The stair dragon actually smiled . The stink of his smoldering cheroot chased Liz up the stairs . She coughed a couple of times , wishing she needed to go all the way up to the fifth floor so she could escape it . But the magazines she wanted lived on the second floor , and the nasty smell was bound to keep coming up after her . <br> Study desks and chairs and tables all stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by which to work here , and the library shut down after dark . The desks and the tables dated back to the Old Time . A few of the chairs  --  the plastic ones with metal legs  --  did , too . Most of those had cracked or worn out since , though . That did n't bother Liz . The wooden ones the Westsiders had made since were more comfortable anyhow . <br> When Liz did go back into the stacks , the musty smell of old paper filled her nostrils . It was stronger here than it would have been in the home timeline . No climate control here , so the paper aged faster . A lot of books on the top floor were damaged beyond repair because the roof leaked . Down here , that was n't a worry , anyhow . <br> She pulled out a bound volume of Newsweek magazines that ran from January to March of 1967 . The war had started  --  and ended  --  in the summer . Nobody at the URL had found the issues for April to June . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Crosstime Traffic discovered this blighted alternate . <br> Liz wanted those , or the equivalent from Time or Life or Look or U.S. News &amp; World Report . She was stuck with what she had , though . She carried the bound volume back to a table . She was the only one there , so she could open the volume  --  carefully  --  and start scanning pages with a handheld scanner that sucked up data the way a vacuum cleaner sucked up dust . <br> If a local did see her doing that , he would n't understand it . Neither this alternate nor the home timeline had known how to make handheld scanners in 1967 . Transistor radios were still pretty new . She saw an ad for one . It was bigger than an iPod , and could n't do one percent as much . It did n't even have an FM band , only AM . And the ad said it was a technological breakthrough ! The scary thing was , maybe the ad was right . <br> The Vietnam War dominated the news . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Liz did n't know exactly how what had happened here differed from what happened in the home timeline . That was why she was sucking up data . Computers could compare the text here to what the same issues said in the home timeline . Once they figured out how things had changed , they would have a better chance of nailing down where the breakpoint lay . <br> In the meantime . . . In the meantime , Liz was unskilled labor . All she had to do was slide the scanner over one column after another . It did the real work . If she wanted to stare at the strange clothes and hairdos and the funky lines of the cars , she could . If she wanted to pause and read something interesting-looking , she could do that . <br> And , as long as the mellow sunshine poured in through the windows , if she wanted to pretend she was at the other UCLA , the right UCLA . . . well , she could almost do that , too . <br> King Zev was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than he was now when he first realized as much . Zev was short and round , not tall and heroic the way kings in stories usually were . Zev was going bald . His beard was scraggly and streaked with gray . He had a big nose . <br> But , when he dressed up in an Old Time business suit and necktie , when he put a top hat on his head , he looked dignified even if not quite handsome . And he owned a big , booming voice , the kind of voice a lot of tall , heroic kings would have envied . He hardly needed the gilded Megaphone of State to get what he wanted to say out to the people and the army of the Valley . <br> Along with the other soldiers who 'd gone down to the Westside 's barricade across the 405 , Dan sat close to the podium from which King Zev spoke . Their tobacco- brown uniforms were a good match for the dirt and the sun- blasted shrubs and bushes all around . Most ordinary people wore homespun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some richer men , though , had on Old Time shirts of nylon and trousers of polyester . The Old Time fabrics could wear out and fray , but bugs and mildew did n't bother them . And the colors and patterns on some of them drove modern weavers and dyers mad with jealousy . <br> " The Westside wo n't get away with it ! " King Zev roared through the megaphone . " We wo n't let the Westside get away with it , will we ? " <br> " No ! " Dan yelled , along with the other soldiers . The ordinary citizens shouted , too , but not so loud . <br> " Down in the Westside , they think they can break treaties whenever they want to , " the king said . " They think they can make us pay for what 's always been a freeway . They think we 're too spineless to care . Are they right ? " <br> " No ! " Dan yelled again , louder than ever . <br> " I ca n't hear you ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No ! " This time , Dan yelled so loud , it hurt . All around him , other young men in uniform were shouting themselves hoarse , too . <br> King Zev smiled . " All right . Good , " he said . " Far freaking out . We 've told them we wo n't stand for it , but they do n't want to listen . So what are we , like , going to do about it ? " <br> " Fight ' em ! " Dan bellowed . The other soldiers were shouting things like " Kill them ! " and " Nuke ' em ! " and " Smash ' em to bits ! " <br> Zev 's smile got wider . " That 's just what we 'll do . I 've given Ambassador Mort his walking papers . He can go down there and tell the Westside City Council our soldiers will take care of their miserable , stupid wall . " <br> Everybody cheered . No one liked the ambassador much . Even for a Westsider , he was pompous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a punishment , not a diplomatic appointment . He walked around as if everything up here smelled bad . <br> " Send him back where he belongs ! " Dan yelled . The soldiers sitting near him laughed and clapped . <br> " I 'm going to send him back , " Zev said , picking up on Dan 's shout . That made Dan feel pretty special . All the people in the Valley were special , just because they were lucky enough to live here . He 'd learned that in school , too . But he felt especially special right now . King Zev went on , " And I 'm going to tell him to tell the City Council they can look for our soldiers right behind him ! " <br> " Right on ! " Dan thrust his fist in the air in a gesture that came from the Old Time . " Right on , your Majesty ! " <br> " Heavy ! That 's soooo heavy ! " Sergeant Chuck agreed . Soldiers and civilians cheered and pounded on things and made as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands . The hot Valley sun gleamed off the golden megaphone . " I thank you , my people , for rolling with me on this one . " Now he 'd said the closing words . It was official . It was democratic . It was war .
