Chace Crawford talks to his parents every day , vacations with his sister and -- unlike his Gossip Girl character -- says dating a married woman is " a definite no . " Without question , success ( he 'll star in the Footloose remake ) could n't have happened to a nicer guy . But what else is behind those blue eyes ? PEOPLE 's Elizabeth Leonard and Jennifer Garcia found out . They just cast you in Footloose . But do you actually dance ? There 's this bar in New York City on the Lower East Side called the Darkroom . They have the best music , so a lot of us will go down there and just kind of let go . I 've got some movement !

Growing up I played a lot of football . But have you seen these kids in Texas who play football ? ! I gave it up to play golf . Did you ever have an awkward phase ? Totally . It was when I had braces in sixth or seventh grade . And then at one point in high school I had blonde tips in my hair . That was my absolute low point . Were you popular with girls ? I was a little shy and would overanalyze stuff . . . maybe a bit overzealous . What kind of car did you drive ? A black Chevy Tahoe truck .

She makes this unbelievable chicken on rice with this sauce that 's out of this world . . . . I owe everything to my mom and dad . What 's in your refrigerator ? Turkey sandwich meat . Wheat bread . Spicy mustard and ketchup . Stubb 's barbecue sauce , the original and the spicy . Coke . Vitaminwater . Lettuce . Peanut butter . And Bud Light . So who has the best swimsuit body : you , Ed Westwick or Penn Badgley ? We have similar body types , but they 've both got the Velcro patch of chest hair . I always make fun of them . Have you ever plucked your eyebrows ? From time to time , my mom would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd say , " I know -- they 're like Brillo pads ! " But I just kinda let ' em go . I do n't like looking that clean . What do you look for in a girlfriend ? It 's definitely more character- and personality-driven for me . I like a girl that keeps me on my toes .

" He 'd never lived away from home before . I had to tell the kid how to work a laundry machine ! Tell us about your new bachelor pad . I 've picked out a cool couch -- I 'm kind of proud of myself . And I 'm getting an espresso machine and I 'll have a tap put in . It 'll be Bud Light . Are you happy being single ? I 'm not not looking for a girlfriend -- but I 'm not particularly looking for a girlfriend , either . I 'm not knocking having a relationship ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ share with someone . But I just look at it as : I have the rest of my life to do that . Is that why things ended with you and Carrie Underwood ? I have nothing bad to say about that experience . It was awesome . I just did n't know how to deal with it . I learned a ton about dating someone in that kind of spotlight . It was such a whirlwind , but no regrets . It was reported you broke up with her via text message . True ? No one breaks up by text ! And oh -- we supposedly never talked again ? I was like , what are you talking about ? It was all absolutely misrepresented . What are some other made-up rumors you 've heard ? The crappiest one is that me and my best friend Westwick are having a homosexual relationship .

I like to draw and I 'm pretty decent , so I 'll draw little pictures and write quotes on them . I 'm romantic but I do things in a creative way . When do you know you have something special ? I know pretty quick if a girl is more than a friend . It 's that simple magnetic attraction , where you just want to be around them constantly . When do you think you 'll settle down ? I do n't trust myself to get married in my 20s . I do n't feel like I 'm mentally there yet ; right now , I 'm having more fun than most 23-year-olds should be allowed to have ! I 'm not in any rush . But someday . . . I want to have a beautiful family . I love kids , so I 'd probably have two , three or four , maybe live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a couple of dogs .
