Headnote We all need a bit of spiritual pruning if we are to bloom where we 're planted . // SOMEBODY TOLD ME RECENTLY THAT THERE ARE TWO kinds of people : gardens and gardeners . Gardens are in need of care and nurture , and gardeners have the tools and know-how to provide such attention . The secret about gardeners , of course , is that they were once gardens themselves . Someone patiently watered and fertilized , pruned , and sunned them so that they could become the capable people they are today . So a deeper truth might be to recognize we all start out as gardens and hold the potential to become gardeners . What does this have to do with the gospel ? A lot , if you count all the stories that Jesus tells about seeds and planting , trees and fruit , wheat and vineyards . Jesus seems fascinated by the fields and orchards around him as he travels the roads between Galilee and Jerusalem . Everywhere he goes , he tells stories about the soil , about things that grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit . And he uses these analogies to illustrate the realities of the kingdom he has come to announce . If we want to know more about the realm of God , perhaps we ought to pay more attention to the back yard . No back yard is technically required , of course . I grew up in a house without one . My father planted flower boxes along the perimeter of the porch . This made it possible to watch the cycle of seeds pushed into the earth , shoots sprouting upward , buds forming on slender branches and finally bursting into bloom . I observed the hierarchy of plants , too-how some crowded out others , claiming water and nutrients at the expense of less aggressive species that would die unless the aggressor was restrained . Some plants dominated the spring and others summer or fall . Nearly all bowed to the finality of winter , surrendering flowers , leaves , color , and frequently their lives . I also saw the central role my father played in orchestrating the society within these boxes . The perennials awakened each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But most plants began their lives by my father 's decree : He chose the seed , pushed his finger into the ground to the right depth , and offered this tiny cocoon of life the possibility to germinate . When there was no rain he provided the water . When the soil grew depleted he added a little Mirade-Gro . When growth was too rapid or lopsided , he pruned and fussed . Without my father 's daily vigilance , those boxes of dirt would have been sprawling , brown , or barren . His pleasure in each blossom and his tender caress of every pretty leaf , I swear , awakened in those plants the desire to delight him more with their colorful performance . I 'D LIKE TO SAY MY FATHER 'S CARE FOR HIS FLOWERS MADE ME a natural gardener myself . I regret to say , however , that I 've been a mass murderer of the plant kingdom . The potted plants and decorative trees that have made their way into my many apartments have known the perils of over-watering and drought , burned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dark corners . They 've grown leggy and exhausted with no pruning or been hatcheted by my too-zealous shears . When it comes to sins of commission and omission , I 've perpetrated both religiously on many potted victims . When it comes to the gardens of our lives , many of us have suffered from the neglect or zeal of our many gardeners . Some parents were frankly AWOL , others maddeningly hypervigilant . Teachers may have ignored us or nagged ceaselessly . Pastors , mentors , friends , and suitors gave us what they had , but not always what we needed . We may have matured quite unevenly : overgrown and overcompensating here , startlingly beautiful there , and barren in some hidden center that no one else may see . HAPPILY FOR US , JESUS IS A BETTER GARDENER THAN THOSE we have known and sometimes endured . He knows precisely why we are shaggy and shapeless in places , and where the aching need for nurture lies . When others pronounce our existence a mere " exhaustion of the soil , " Jesus sees only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , pulling out minerals and chemicals , hoses and stakes , rakes and hoes and cutting implements . The process can seem formidable , and the transformation will not come without cost . But we can trust these gentle , knowing hands to do what must be done to bring us to our fulfillment . But wait . If Jesus is such a good gardener , then why are our churches not full of perfectly manicured gardens ? Why do n't we look across the assembly and see nothing but riotous blooms and fruitful trees ? And since successful gardens produce able gardeners for others , as the theory goes , why is n't our planet awash in a vibrant and healthy humanity ? Instead we all seem to know a lot of people dying on the vine . We have family members who , despite all our care and attention , are withering away in a sunless reality . We see the pews stacked with people so sick in body , mind , and spirit it 's as if they had never met Jesus . Whole segments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from prosperity and promise . Entire nations live in moral and political deserts that were once lands of opportunity and hope . Clearly other forces are at work that oppose the efforts of every gardener . Molds and insect infestations , animal attacks and accidents , and unusually harsh weather can all undermine the progress of the healthiest plant . And some living things are inherently weaker and more vulnerable . One great challenge to their well-being , and they are doomed . So many things can go wrong , in fact , that it takes the combined efforts of every gardener to nurture and sustain life in such a dangerous world . The task laid before us in the gospels is simple : Let Jesus into your garden . Take the time , make the room , accept the challenge , and endure the often painful process of correction and redirection . Of course it will be costly . Healing is an expensive proposition . It might cost the pruning away of a job , a lifestyle , a relationship , or a cherished worldview . But once we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so let 's not kid ourselves-we can become part of the healing process for others . Healing comes from God , and we have to get it first in order to reveal it to others . We ca n't manufacture it out of our own desire ; heaven knows how many of us have tried . AND ONCE WE COOPERATE WITH THE GARDENING PROCESS , we can expect miracles . A stick in my present yard confirmed this for me . This stick was once a pretty little plant but apparently it died , despite or because of my many attempts to nurture it . Every flower dropped off , then every leaf , and finally every branch . All that was left was a stick straight up in the dirt , which drew laughter from my neighbor every time I came out to water it . I poured water around that stick every day , wind or calm , heat or cold , with absolute fidelity . For four months I watered that stick , and for four months my hopefulness attracted the derision of the neighbor . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stick , then another , and then a half dozen little bumps . And the bumps budded and shot out tender branches , which produced tiny leaves , and within two months the darn thing was nodding in the breeze with great heads of flowers dancing and swaying . And every time those huge flowers nodded at me , I felt they were saying yes , yes , yes to my faith in them . I have to admit it was n't my faith in the flowers to come that made me dump water on that hopeless stick day after day . It was the memory of a time when I was myself a barren stick , yielding nothing , without promise , but cared for nonetheless .
