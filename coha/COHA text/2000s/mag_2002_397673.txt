Battling thin air and raging winds , Scouts climb Mexico 's highest mountain one tough step at a time . Photograph Scout Andrew Deuell is a glimmer of color in the early morning hours atop Jamapa Glacier in Mexico . Soon , the sun will rise and cast a glare over everything . // THE SCOUTS OF TROOP 136 were just 100 vertical feet from the 18,405-foot summit of North America 's third tallest mountain . Their heads were light from the altitude , their muscles strained and sore , their physical condition dirty . It had taken a grueling night climb to get this high-and they still were n't at the top . They trained hard before traveling thousands of miles from their hometown of Laramie , Wyo. , to the glacial slopes of El Pico de Orizaba . They even learned survival Spanish to get along in Mexico . After all their planning-the long hikes back home and laborious conditioning  --  their goal was finally in sight . But El Pico de Orizaba had other plans . The inactive volcano battered the climbers with brutal wind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " spindrifts , " that felt like sandpaper . " It was miserable , " recalls First Class Scout Nathan Shipley , 15 . " The wind was blowing 90 miles per hour . It was picking us up and blowing us off our feet . " Thus , 100 feet may well have been 100 miles . There was no guarantee that they could do it . Practice , Practice These Scouts like a challenge , and they took full advantage of their Wyoming roots when prepping for this trip . They climbed Devil 's Tower in their backyard , rafted Utah 's Green River and summited several 14,000-foot Colorado peaks . But none of the four Scouts who took on Orizaba had ever been anywhere near a mountain of this size . The only higher peaks on this continent are Mount McKinley in Alaska ( 20,320 feet ) and Mount Logan in Canada ( 19,551 feet ) .

( See " Mountain Tools . " ) They spent weekends in the nearby Snowy Range just to get some mountain time . Assistant Scoutmasters Matt Troyanek and Brian Sinicki even made them endure a cold , snowy night on a Laramie golf course to get the feel of ice in their bones . Troyanek wanted his Scouts not just to be prepared , he wanted them over  --  prepared . " What if we were at 17,000 feet and someone just collapsed on the mountain and we had to haul them off ? " he asked the guys . South of the Border When they arrived in Mexico City the day after Christmas . the American Scouts were greeted by three Mexican Scouts who served as guides to the third largest city in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pyramids and colorful outdoor markets . Then they got on a bus for the three-hour ride east to the town of Tlachichuca , at the foot of Orizaba . That night they stayed with their outfitter , a friend of Troop 136 assistant Scoutmaster John Bowen . Bowen had already climbed Orizaba eight times and knew how unpredictable the mountain could be . After a good night 's sleep , the four Scouts and four adult leaders drove to ira Grande base camp at 14,000 feet . The volcano , which has not blown its top since 1687 ( see " Climb to the Stars " ) , was in a good mood this day . The climbers enjoyed sunny skies , calm winds and a fresh layer of snow that made the climbing easy . Their luck , however , would n't hold . Onward and Upward After fueling up with oatmeal , granola bars and hot tea , the Wyoming crew started the eight-hour climb to the summit at the stroke of midnight . Climbers start out early because the snow pack weakens when the sun comes up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the return trip . Everyone assembled for a quick ice axe salute , and they set off in howling winds and temperatures in the low 30 's . Photograph Assistant Scoutmaster Brian Sinicki ( left ) and Scout Andrew Deuell rest // Scout Jesse Owens , 15 , was roped to Bowen . Life Scout Aaron Deuell , 18 , his brother Star Scout Andrew , 16 , and Nathan were roped to Troyanek . Almost immediately , Jesse started showing signs of altitude sickness-disorientation , fatigue and nausea . " I was tired and cold . " he recalls . " I started stumbling because I was dizzy . " The wind picked up as they ascended , and Jesse could n't keep warm no matter how much outerwear he added . The raging gusts knocked him around like a leaf in a breeze . He stumbled his way to 16,500 feet , but could n't take another step . Exhausted , he had to bail . Jesse was escorted back down to camp . Jesse recovered quickly at a lower altitude . Although he did n't summit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt good about it . So Close ... Meanwhile , the others clawed their way up the glacier . But the bad weather just got worse . The winds gusted to 90 miles per hour , literally lifting the climbers off their feet . They took a step , then waited for each gust to pass before taking another . The danger was undeniably real . If a team member slipped and did n't ice axe arrest quickly enough , he could drag all the roped-together team down to the bare rocks thousands of feet below . The Scouts ' training saved them . " We would just lean into it and fall toward the glacier and catch ourselves , " Nathan said . " After a while , it became so routine you just did it . " The team fought the weather all the way to the crater rim . Just 100 feet from the top , Troyanek made the call : It was too dangerous to continue . Troyanek feared the Scouts could be blown into the crater or down the glacier . " Never let desire overrule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you draw that line will determine what stories you have to tell when you get back . " They turned back . Nobody second-guessed the decision , on the mountain of later back home . Making it almost 18,000 feet in incredible conditions that would challenge any accomplished climber was accomplishment enough for the members of Troop 136 . " It is definitely the biggest thing I have done in my life so far , " Aaron said . Photograph Sidebar CLIMB TO THE STARS Sidebar The Aztecs called Mexico 's El Pico de Orizaba " Citlaltepetl. " which means " Mountain of the Star . " An inactive volcano , it has n't erupted in more than 300 years . It has , however , claimed lives-most recently in December 1999 , when three Russian climbers , roped together for safety , slid to their deaths when one fell . While this suggests most guys are n't ready to hike up such an angry hill three-plus miles high you can and should conquer smaller hills and mountains , And work your way up .

WHERE YOU DRAW THAT LINE WILL DETERMINE WHAT STORIES YOU HAVE TO TELL WHEN YOU GET BACK . Sidebar MOUNTAIN TOOLS Sidebar Mountaineering requires some serious hardware items . Among them : Sidebar Ice axe : A T-shaped axe with a long handle . The head has a sharp point on one side and a flat blade for chopping snow and ice on the other . It is used to arrest a fall . Sidebar Crampons : Sharp metal points that attach to the sole of a mountaineer 's boots for sure footing on snow and ice . Mountaineering boots : These can be leather , but are usually insulated with a plastic shell . They resemble a downhill ski boot . // <p>    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
