BORROWING MONEY TO PLAY THE STOCK MARKET IS BOTH ALLURING AND DANGEROUS . // LENA GOVBERG knows all about taking risks . She did , after all , emigrate alone from Russia to the U.S. at age 15 . And at 26 she had the iron stomach to quit her job as a lab biologist to trade stocks full time from her Sunnyvale , Calif. home . But even her husband balked when she took things a step further and began trading on margin . Govberg felt she had little to lose . With $30,000 in her account , she could double her gambling chips by borrowing from her online brokerage and securing that loan with nothing more than the value of her portfolio . At first she made small bets , borrowing a few thousand dollars to buy blue chips like Cisco and Dell . As her profits grew , so did her confidence . Soon she was taking five-figure fliers on razzledazzle Internet issues like Yahoo ! and Ariba . Her nerve paid off Three years later , her initial investment-plus an additional $200,000 from her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fun house , where soaring stocks and an increasingly popular gambit called margin trading can warp your fortunes in a flash . And although no one yet tracks the exact correlation between online investing and margin debt , the simultaneous explosion of both over the past few years is far from a coincidence . " As people transition to online trading , they trade more and hold higher margin balances , " says Greg Smith , analyst for Chase H &Q.; That could be because the Internet makes trading on margin easier than ever . All it takes to open a margin account is a $2,000 balance and a click of the mouse . There 's usually a questionnaire in place of a credit check . And there 's no human broker to raise a judgmental eyebrow . In all , margin debt on NYSE and Nasdaq stocks has increased a mindnumbing 64% over the past year to an all-time high of $242 billion . That 's up from about $35 billion a decade ago . And it seems there 's no bottom to the well of available cash . Despite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwilling to alter the margin requirements set in 1974 , which allow investors to borrow up to 50% of the purchase price of a stock . Though brokerages are free to raise their own requirements , many of them are reluctant to cut into the easy profits they make from the 7% to 10% lending rates . So who 's complaining ? No one - while the getting is good and the riches abound . But just as margin trading can compound profits , it can greatly magnify losses . Should the market- or even just a sliver of the market-turn south , borrowers could get wiped out . And when they do , they could take the rest of the market with them . The dreaded margin call The attraction of margin trading is devilishly simple . Say you 've got $10,000 to invest in XYZ.com . Borrowing an equal amount from your broker , you buy $20,000 of the stock . Now say XYZ.com shoots up 50% . Suddenly , you have $30,000 in shares . When you pay back the $10,000 you borrowed , plus the loan rate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you traded on your savings alone , your gains would amount to only $5,000 . But say XYZ.com tanks by 50% . The $20,000 investment drops to $10,000 . After paying back your $10,000 loan , your initial investment is decimated . Had you declined to borrow money in the first place , you would have salvaged $5,000 . Trading on margin is risky not just for Photograph Risk has been kind to Lena Govberg so far . // you but for the brokerages too . If your bet goes sour , so too might their loan . When a sinking stock approaches the level where selling it would n't raise enough money to repay your loan , brokers can issue what 's known as a margin call . Here 's how it works : In an investment made on margin , a drop in the stock 's value cats into your contribution first . When the stock price falls so far that the amount you had put up is less than 25% of the current value of the investment , the broker can order you to sell the stock at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still think the stock will go up ) or to deposit more cash into your account immediately . If you do n't , the broker can liquidate your other stocks to cover the loan without your assent , without your input and , in fact , without even bothering to tell you . That 's what happened to Lael Desmond . He had about $50,000 and an equal amount on margin in his nine-month-old Ameritrade account , all riding on Internet stocks like Yahoo ! , Excite and AOL . Then 27 , Desmond had recently quit a $40,000a-year job in chemical sales , hoping his investments would yield enough money for his medical school tuition . Desmond 's thin grasp on how margin loans worked did n't stop him from using them . " My understanding at the time was that it was like a loan at a bank , " he says . " You pay interest on the amount you borrow . " He got a brutally swift education in August 1998 . After a drop in the market , Desmond received a letter demanding a prompt infusion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the demand had risen to $13,000 . He scrambled to collect cash advances from five credit cards to make the payment . A swoon in the market soon upped the amount he owed to $21,000 . He rushed to the bank and wired the money , just making Ameritrade 's three-day deadline . When he called later that day to check up , he learned that his entire portfolio had been liquidated at nine that morning . Desmond took his dispute to arbitration and won , but the victory is bittersweet . After lawyer 's fees , he will wind up with $25,000 , about half his original investment . Had his stocks been left untouched , he figures his portfolio could be worth about $300,000 . Ameritrade said in a written statement to MONEY that if Desmond had represented his income , net worth and trading experience accurately , he " would not have qualified " for a margin account . Desmond 's experience scared him off margin trading-forever . " I feel I was completely misled , " says Desmond , now 28 and slogging through med school exams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where I stood ! The broker 's responsibility This kind of misunderstanding seems more common with online investors , says Mary Schapiro , president of the National Association of Securities Dealers ' regulatory arm . " There 's the loss of a personal relationship between the individual and the broker , " she says . " A lot of people are so eager to be in the market , they 're not taking the time to understand how it works . " So when it comes to margin trading , how much responsibility rests with the brokerage ? According to Schapiro , firms have an obligation to " watch what customers are doing . " And brokerages should disclose the risks , the costs of the loan and the implications of a margin call . The dangers and the benefits of margin loans tug brokerages " in a couple of directions , " says Tom Schlesinger , executive director of the Financial Markets Center , a research group that studies the effects of margin debt . On the one hand , brokers love the easy money they make off the interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most creditworthy , " says Schlesinger , " and the brokers stand at risk in the event of a downturn . " // MARGINAL IMPACT // Jose Contin , who heads Web trading at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter Online , acknowledges the danger . " Our customers were putting our firm at risk , " he says . In response , the brokerage recently raised its minimum maintenance requirement , the minimum percentage of an investment 's current value that must have come from the investor 's own pocket . NYSE and NASD rules set the minimum at 25% ; MSDW Online , along with other big brokerages like Schwab and Fidelity , has raised its minimum to 35% . The bigger brokerages also keep lists of about 200 stocks with higher minimums , and some that are deemed too volatile to trade on margin at all . And the brokerages try to monitor customer accounts . " Where you get in trouble is when you 're highly concentrated and highly leveraged , " says Tracey Curvey , executive vice president of the online brokerage at Fidelity . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murmurs of caution , the brokerages are careful not to discourage margin trading altogether . " We think there 's an opportunity there for the sophisticated investor , " says Curvey . And the Fed , for its part , has n't budged on the minimum margin purchase requirement of 50% , even though the Clinton Administration has encouraged tighter restrictions to tamp down some of the rampant borrowing . The danger is the much larger impact margin loans could have on the rest of the market , if and when it should collapse . It 's a domino effect : When prices start to fall , the value of margined portfolios falls ; lenders issue margin calls ; the margin calls force the sale of stock , the mass sales of stock pressure prices even further . " That happened with a vengeance in 1929 , " says Schlesinger of the Financial Markets Center , " the last time margin debt was at such explosive levels . " ' It 's all on your back ' For now , the game is wide open to anyone who wants to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calif. have raked in the benefits . He pumped an $18,000 account up to $268,000 in a year and a half , he says , by placing huge risky bets on margin . But he 's also suffered through five margin calls , some of which resulted in the sale of his stock by his brokerage - even though he tried to wire them cash to cover the call . " You have to expect that things just do n't work that smoothly on the Internet yet " says Harris . " The thing is , it 's all on your back . There 's no forgiveness , no understanding . " It 's serious stuff . " In good times , margin trading can build wealth quickly , " says Harris . " In bad times , it can ruin you .

Sidebar MARGIN TRADING : BEFORE YOU BORROW The potential gains using margin are undeniable . But so are the risks . It has to be said : Trading stocks with money that is n't yours is not investing-it 's speculating . But if you 're thinking of giving it a try anyway , keep these essentials in mind . 1 . Learn all your broker 's rules before you take a loan . Even if you 've traded on margin before , each firm has its own maintenance requirements , restricted-margin stocks and margin call rules . 2 . Be prepared for the consequences of a margin call . Your broker has the right to sell your stocks to cover its loan if you ca n't come up with extra cash fast enough . 3 . Only borrow amounts you can afford to loseor are able to cover easily with cash from other accounts . 4 . Keep your holdings diversified . If you concentrate all your margined stocks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rise or fall in tandem . If they all fall at once , there 's an increased chance you 'll get hit with a margin call . 5 . Never buy an IPO ( or newly issued stock ) on margin . In today 's seesaw IPO environment , it 's too risky to even contemplate . Fortunately , many brokerages wo n't even let you . - L.R.C .
