We know that from , well , experience . <p> Receiver Cris Carter and the Minnesota Vikings are in the NFL playoffs for the fourth consecutive season . <p> They hope to put that experience to use Sunday when they visit the St. Louis Rams  --  a franchise that has n't reached the postseason since 1989 , when it was the Los Angeles Rams . <p> " The only teams that say experience is n't that valuable are the ones that do n't have it , " Carter says . <p> However , playoff experience is n't everything . Teams loaded with it  --  Denver , Green Bay and San Francisco  --  did n't qualify this postseason .

No rookie quarterback has won a playoff game since the Rams ' Pat Haden in 1976 . <p> Though St. Louis quarterback Kurt Warner has been in two Arena Football League championships with the Iowa Barnstormers , he 'll get his NFL playoff baptism Sunday against Minnesota . <p> " We have to approach this like it is another game , but in the back of everybody 's mind , it is do-or-die , " Warner says .

" <p>  --  Mark Twain <p> You do n't know what a NFL playoff game is like until you actually play in one . <p> However , there are precedents for players and teams with little or no playoff experience having more than a little impact . <p> In 1981 , the San Francisco 49ers had three rookies in the defensive backfield : Ronnie Lott , Carlton Williamson and Eric Wright . The quarterback had never started a playoff game : Joe Montana . <p> The 49ers won the Super Bowl that season under coach Bill Walsh , who had never been a head coach in the playoffs . <p> Heading into the 1992 postseason , quarterback Troy Aikman of the Dallas Cowboys had never started a playoff game ( he 'd come off the bench the year before in a second-round loss to Detroit ) . <p> In the ' 92 and ' 93 seasons , Aikman took Dallas to Super Bowl titles . <p> " What we have to learn to do , we learn by doing .

Now , they 're trying to get over that hump , and Carter likes the fact that his team is loaded with playoff vets . <p> " It does play a part in the game , " Carter says . <p> " It has an effect on the people as far as their preparation . It has an effect as far as their outlook on the game and what they can do and what 's not realistic given the circumstances  - -  and the unknown . " <p> Carter was with the Philadelphia Eagles in 1988 when he made his playoff debut in a loss in Chicago . " That was the Fog Bowl , " he says . " We thought we were going to kill them . It was difficult . And we struggled . The conditions were tough .

For me , it 's kind of fresh because that 's all I prepare for in my mind . I ca n't wait to get through the preseason because that means the regular season . I ca n't wait to go through the regular season because I know the playoffs are at the end of that . " <p> While San Francisco won a Super Bowl in the 1981 season with a team untested in the playoffs , it had veteran leadership from the likes of linebacker Jack " Hacksaw " Reynolds and tight end Charle Young . <p> St. Louis has 12 players with a combined 49 games of playoff experience , but none of it with the Rams . <p> Guard Adam Timmerman started in two Super @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know what it is like , they can ask him , " Rams coach Dick Vermeil says . <p> " I have been in the Super Bowl , " the former Philadelphia coach adds .

" <p> The Jacksonville Jaguars are in the playoffs for the fourth consecutive season , hosting Miami on Saturday . Jacksonville quarterback Mark Brunell is 3-3 in playoff starts . <p> This is safety Carnell Lake 's first playoff with the Jaguars , but he 's a seasoned vet of postseason play with Pittsburgh . <p> " You have to eliminate the distractions . There 's a heck of a lot more media coverage , " Lake says . " Everybody is calling you and wanting tickets , and you 've got to somehow see through that and focus on your job .

But they experienced that last season when they lost 38-3 in Denver to the Super Bowl champs . <p> " We know it 's going to be a tough place to play . . . but I think we understand what the circumstances are as a group , " Marino says . <p> While King is making his rookie playoff debut for Tampa Bay , the Bucs and defensive tackle Warren Sapp did make the playoffs in 1997 ( beating Detroit and losing to Green Bay ) . <p> " I think when we first went nobody had ever been there , " Sapp says . <p> " We were in the unknown . Right now , our experience from 1997 should help us . . . . We feel we have the experience and know-how to make those four , five plays that will gives us the win in the ballgame .

In his second season , he took Miami to the Super Bowl , where the Dolphins lost to San Francisco . Miami has been to the playoffs five previous times in the ' 90s , including the past two seasons . <p> However , Marino has n't been back to the Super Bowl . Manning is aware of that . <p> " It 's a good lesson that you have to take advantage of the opportunity now because you never know when it 's going to come back again , " Manning says . " These days , with free agency and injuries , who knows what your team is going to be like next year ? <p> " So when you have a chance , you might as well go for it now .
