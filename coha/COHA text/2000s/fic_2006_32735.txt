Chapter One Buck Williams realized he would be no more dead outside under the erupting Haifa night skies than he would be inside the command center . This was not bravado ; it was the unique , insatiable curiosity of the journalist . He would be the lone casualty at this post who would see and know what killed him . On rubbery legs , he made his way to a door . No one seemed to notice or care to caution him . It was as if they had all been sentenced to death . He forced open the door against a furnace blast and shielded his eyes from the whiteness of the blaze . The sky was afire . Jets screamed over the din of the inferno , and exploding missiles sent more showers of flame into the air . He stood in stark terror , amazed as the great machines of war plummeted all over the city , crashing and bouncing and rolling and burning . But these all seemed to fall between buildings and in deserted streets and fields . Buck 's face blistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was happening ? * * * Nicolae Carpathia was a light sleeper , thus the quiet buzz programmed into a tiny device in his headboard woke him immediately at just after one-thirty in the morning . Hesat up , vigorously rubbed his eyes and face , and pressed the intercom button . " Gabriella ? " " Yes , sir . My apologies , but Mr. Fortunato is here and assures me you would want to be awakened . " So it had happened . It was done . Less than a minute later , Nicolae had dragged a wet comb through his hair and pulled on a luxurious robe . He padded to the elevator , which opened into his parlor and brought him face-to-face with his most trusted adviser . Carpathia fought to suppress a smile . " Leon , what is it ? " " Israel is being obliterated as we speak . " Nicolae clapped . " The Russians ? " he said , as if guessing . Fortunato nodded , smiling . " There 's evidence Libya and Ethiopia are cooperating . " " Perfect . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budge . Wonder what he is thinking now . Or whether he will ever think again . Hoarding his formula was a waste . No one could maximize the benefits as I can . " Fortunato grimaced . " What ? " Nicolae said . He pointed to a divan . " Sit , my friend . " Leon settled heavily onto the couch . " Do n't assume the Kremlin will bring you in on this , Nicolae . My sources tell me this offensive is as costly a single assault as they have ever attempted . The cadre I introduced you to will likely want to license you only a portion of the rights to market in certain areas . " Nicolae sat across from Leon on a large ottoman . " And you have some illusion that this would be enough for me ? Surely you are sporting . " " I know how you feel , Nicolae ; it simply may not be as easy as we 'd like . Forgive me , chief , but why do you continue to grin like the Cheshire cat ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already been made , Leon . " " Sorry ? " " You did not hear me or did not understand ? " " The latter , sir . " " Between Jonathan Stonagal and me , we financed this operation and settled on terms before the first plane left the ground . Russia will have unlimited use of the formula for their entire expanse , as will Ethiopia and Libya , but the marketing of it throughout the rest of the world is under my purview , and they get an appropriate royalty . Seven percent . " Leon shook his head and leaned back , squinting at Nicolae . " You ca n't be serious . " " Of course I am . I would not make light of billions of dollars . Would you like the privilege of informing Mr. Stonagal ? It is just before seven in New York , and the old man will be on his treadmill . " Leon sighed . " He 's the one who informed me . " " But he did not tell you of the arrangement ? " Leon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Neither of you did . My role has been clarified . " " Oh , make no mistake about that , Leon . You know more than anyone in my orbit , but you do not need to know all-neither shall you ever . You will know what you need to know and when I feel you should know it . Understood ? " " As I said , my role has been clarified . " * * * Chunks of ice and hailstones as big as golf balls forced Buck to cover his head with his jacket as the earth shook and resounded , throwing him to the ground . Facedown in the freezing shards , he felt rain wash over him . Suddenly the only sound was the fire in the sky , and it began to fade as it drifted lower . After ten minutes of thunderous roaring , the fire dissipated , and scattered balls of flame flickered on the ground . The firelight disappeared as quickly as it had come . Stillness settled over the land . As clouds of smoke wafted away on a gentle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars shone peacefully as if nothing had gone awry . Buck turned back to the building , his muddy leather jacket in his fist . The doorknob was still hot , and inside , military leaders wept and shuddered . The radio was alive with reports from Israeli pilots . They had not been able to get airborne in time to do anything but watch as the entire Russian air offensive seemed to destroy itself . Miraculously , not one casualty was reported in all of Israel . Otherwise Buck might have believed some mysterious malfunction had caused missile and plane to destroy each other . But as he interviewed the shaken men and women who had monitored the thing on computer screens , they told another story . A young female Israeli soldier , in heavily accented but precise English , told him , " It was a firestorm , along with rain and hail and an earthquake . That is what saved us from destruction . " It was the story of a lifetime , and Buck quickly appropriated a jeep and raced throughout the country , interviewing leaders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as he drove were hundreds and thousands of chunks of burning , twisted , molten steel that had smashed to the ground in Haifa , Jerusalem , Tel Aviv , Jericho , even Bethlehem-leveling ancient walls but not so much as scratching one living creature . That was beyond Buck 's comprehension ; he simply could not make it compute . As dawn broke several hours later , special task forces competed with buzzards and vultures for the flesh of the enemy dead , scrambling to bury them before their bones were picked clean and disease threatened the nation . Buck was greatly relieved to find that Dr. Rosenzweig had escaped unscathed . " Had I not been here and seen it myself , I would not have believed it , " he told the scientist . " It will take more than I have in me to make my readers buy it either . " Rosenzweig seemed strangely quiet . " What is it , Doctor ? " Buck said . " Well , it is just that I feel strange broaching this subject , as an agnostic at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some scholars who might have an interesting take on this ? " Rosenzweig introduced Buck to university professors who pointed out passages from the Bible that talked about God destroying Israel 's enemies with a firestorm , an earthquake , hail , and rain . Buck was stunned to read Ezekiel 38 and 39 about a great enemy from the north invading Israel with the help of Persia , Libya , and Ethiopia . More stark was that the Scriptures foretold of weapons of war used as fire fuel and enemy soldiers eaten by birds or buried in a common grave . Buck was n't prepared to become religious , he told himself , but he certainly became a different person and a different journalist . Nothing would ever again be beyond his belief . And if there was one person he wanted to talk to about all this , it was his Chicago colleague Lucinda Washington . ( Continues ... )
