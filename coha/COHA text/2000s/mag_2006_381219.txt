Actor and Grammy winner Ludacris narrates the new girls ' basketball documentary The Heart of the Game . <P> So does this mean you 're a WNBA fan ? I ca n't necessarily say I 'm a fan , because I do n't get to watch television . Period . I 'm a fan of the NBA , but I do n't even get to watch that . <P> This spring you went to the Oscars , the Kentucky Derby , the Indy 500 and the White House correspondents ' dinner . You really get around . Yeah , man , life is a garden . You got ta dig it . <P> Which was more interesting : walking the red carpet at the Oscars or ringing the opening bell at NASDAQ ? Walking the carpet . But do n't get me wrong  --  I think I made history being the first rapper to ring the bell . I do n't think I understood the importance of it until after I did it , so it did n't seem as exciting as everyone made it out to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mentions the beef you have with Oprah . I would n't call it a beef . I would call it a disagreement . I went to talk about Crash and racial discrimination , and I had my own Crash moment because Oprah was prejudiced against me because of my lyrics . She mentioned that I donated over $100,000 to Katrina victims , but that got edited out . But it was O.K. for everything that bashed me to stay in there . <P> You have five cars , but your favorite is your ' 93 Acura Legend ? Yeah , it always brings me back to the mentality I had before I was a star . And it still runs the same way .
