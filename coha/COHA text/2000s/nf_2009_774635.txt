The American Bible // David O. Selznick , Hollywood 's self-appointed reader-in-residence , was convinced audiences would sit still for adaptations of famous books , preferably from the nineteenth century and preferably British . The producer had proved it with Little Women , David Copperfield , and A Tale of Two Cities , three certifiable winners , and what was Gone with the Wind but a nineteenth-century novel in twentieth-century covers ... or a twentieth-century novel in nineteenth-century clothing ? His other article of faith was fidelity to the source , especially when the work was as widely read and fresh in people 's minds as Margaret Mitchell 's Gone with the Wind . To Sidney Howard , the screenwriter , he recommended making large rather than small cuts , in that " minor changes may give us slight improvements , but there will be five or ten million readers on our heads for them , where , for the most part , they will recognize the obvious necessity of our making drastic cuts . " He even urged against changes in construction , because " I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never knows what chemicals have gone to make up something that has appealed to millions of people . " // In another memo , Selznick referred to the novel as the American Bible , though with an ulterior motive : he was writing to the censor Will Hays , trying to get " damn " into the punch line at the end of the movie . There 's violence and rape , there are curses and improprieties in the Bible , was the implication , so why not in Gone with the Wind ? And besides , Selznick lectured , " damn " was not a curse but a " vulgarism , " so described in The Oxford English Dictionary . // It was therefore a fairly big deal when , in a rare deviation from the sacred text , David Selznick decided that Gone with the Wind ' s ending had to be changed for the movie version . The book 's ending was too downbeat , too anticlimactic . After Rhett 's departure with the immortal and now officially authorized valedictory , " Frankly , my dear , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would still decide to return to Tara , to Mammy , to regroup for the possible recapture of Rhett . But Selznick needed to bring Scarlett out of the fog of fear and defeat and give an uplift to the famous concluding line from the book , " Tomorrow is another day . " To this end the ghostly voices of her father , Rhett , Ashley would recall to her the magic of Tara , the importance of the land , her one true love . Whereas in the book , Scarlett 's thoughts of winning Rhett back are uppermost ( " There had never been a man she could n't get , once she set her mind upon him " ) , the movie wafts to its end with the softer and more ennobling image of her attachment to Tara . // It 's anybody 's guess whether the devious charmer we 've come to know as Atlanta 's most fun-loving shopaholic and shrewd entrepreneur would be content to remain down on the farm , but it 's a testimonial to the conviction of this strangely enduring American epic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skepticism and accept Scarlett 's bond with the land as something fundamental and spiritual , almost redemptive. // Much of the credit for the effectiveness of the denouement goes to the art direction of William Cameron Menzies and the movie 's bold , even gothic , use of Technicolor . The spell has been cast by the early scene in which Gerald O'Hara and Scarlett stand under the gnarled bough of a tree , overlooking Tara . The plantation is aglow in a fiery sunset , and the two figures in burnt silhouette suggest both the end and the beginning of the world . The return of that image in the final moments , the visual sweep echoed in Max Steiner 's swelling score , completes the emotional sanctification of the land as transcendent value , cemented by the alliance of the daughter with the father , whose Irish blood has by this time marked her character so much more forcefully and balefully than the bluer blood of her Charleston mother . // In a curious way , yet consistent with their different sensibilities , Selznick 's ending is more romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ optimism grounded , literally and figuratively , in something more substantial than Scarlett 's wish-fulfillment fantasies . ( The inveterate hopefuls among Mitchell fans and the best-selling sequel to the contrary , can anyone over the mental age of fifteen believe that the star-crossed lovers will " get together " one day ? Or that they should ? Even preview audiences , not the most sophisticated crowd and notoriously disposed to feel-good resolutions , but with divine authority where Selznick was concerned , had no objections to the " unhappy " ending. ) // The idea of the moral superiority of the land over other forms of acquisition , the legacy of Thomas Jefferson , is one of our most stubbornly enduring myths , persisting despite the continuous and increasing migration to the cities and cherished even among those whose closest acquaintance with a working farm is the occasional drive-by purchase of strawberries or corn at a roadside stand . Or , in the case of Selznick , who made his first trip south for the premiere of the film , viewing gorgeously evocative sketches on a Hollywood storyboard . Land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strands whereby the tale of a recalcitrant corner of the country-or , rather , a tiny segment of that corner ! - the antebellum , slave-owning renegade South , is alchemized into a national epic of struggle and triumph . // If not exactly the " story that belongs to all of us , " as the producer boasted of the 1936 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel he was bringing to the screen , Gone with the Wind , in both novel and movie form , can claim to have appealed to the fantasies of a remarkably large number of people . And to have gone on doing so long after its sell-by date . In box office terms , with a domestic gross of $1,329,453,600 adjusted for inflation , it remains the biggest blockbuster of all time , surpassing ( after having paved the way for ) such runaway hits as Star Wars , The Sound of Music , E.T . , and Titanic . The only " phenom " to have come close in recent years is not a movie at all but the sleekly murderous and misogynous video game Grand Theft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scarlett and all the brainy babes who have threatened to make them obsolescent . // Costing an unprecedented $4,250,000 to produce , Gone with the Wind was the first " event " film , and for better and mostly worse , its surprising success changed the way Hollywood thought about movies , whetting its appetite for winner-take-all box-office bonanzas . It was the longest and most expensive film ever made ; it went on to earn the highest receipts and win the most Academy Awards . By 1987 , in 1987 dollars , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer theatrical rentals ran to over eight hundred million dollars . In its first run , the movie sold 202 million tickets , a stunning figure considering that the U.S. population was only a little over 130 million at the time . No less dazzling and enduring has been the popularity of the book . If Macmillan editor and scout Harold Latham had " sniffed " a best seller when he read the manuscript , no one at the publishing company was prepared for the extent of its popularity , especially at an astronomical three dollars a copy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ robustly , thanks no doubt partly to the movie , and to date has sold more than twenty-eight million copies worldwide . // It has inspired sequels and prequels , satires and send-ups . Alexandra Ripley 's nearly unreadable Scarlett , with the heroine returning to her Irish " roots " and getting rescued from political rioters by an opportunely arriving Rhett , was nevertheless a best seller . Carol Burnett got one of her best skits swathed in the green velvet curtains of Tara 's mistress on her way to con money out of Rhett . One look at the curtain rods jutting out like extreme shoulder pads and the audience did n't even need to be told who she was . It has provoked fictional anti- Gone with the Wind responses from African Americans , most famously and litigiously The Wind Done Gone , by Alice Randall , which as " parody " escaped attempts by the Mitchell estate to block publication . In 1966 , an African American writer named Margaret Walker published Jubilee , in which a strong mulatto slave named Vyry , a more youthfully attractive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addled mistress . More oblique resistances to the book 's generic portrait of passive and contented slaves have come from Alice Walker , Mary Cond ? , Toni Morrison , and Gloria Naylor. // Gone with the Wind has proved endlessly pliable to reinterpretations , a story to remake or modify according to competing personal mythologies , disturbing-even terrifying-in its power to override reality , ideology , and common sense . The spin-offs and sequels continue to multiply , thanks to the presumed wishes of hordes of people who , like Kathy Bates 's murderous fan in Misery , will not let Rhett and Scarlett die or go their own ways . And the dollar-minded Mitchell estate is apparently happy to comply with projects as long as they do n't sully or snicker at Saint Margaret 's version or turn the characters gay . // Rhett Butler 's People , Donald McCaig 's best-selling prequel of 2007 , gives us the " backstory " of Rhett , a revisionist reading of Rhett 's plantation childhood as a young master averse to taking up the seigneurial reigns . In this more politically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefers to hunt , fish , and pick cotton with the black boys . ( Be advised : plot giveaway ahead . ) The novel opens with a duel , in which the adult Rhett defends Belle Watling 's honor against her white-trash brother 's crude aspersions , and ends ... yes , happily . Amid an extended family and staff that include all extant blacks and whites , Scarlett and Rhett look back with fond humor on all their foolishness , Scarlett appreciates Rhett 's enabling hand in her own transformation ( " I was a child , Rhett helped me become who I am " ) , and Scarlett and Belle even become gal pals . // Undeterred by the fate of a musical some years ago that began in Tokyo , stopped off in London , and flamed out in Atlanta , and as a testament to the philosophy that tomorrow is another day , a three-and-a-half-hour musical recently staggered into London 's West End and soon met a predictable demise . Rather impressively , the author of the new show 's book was a fifty-three-year-old American named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on an office floor with her two children , Martin understood Scarlett 's struggle with poverty but made rather better use of it , achieving a doctorate in public health and founding a nonprofit agency . Her determination proved equal to writing the book , winning over the Mitchell estate , and securing Trevor Nunn as director but faltered in the face of an artistic impossibility . // Scarlett and Rhett may not be on the same level as such towering archetypes of American literature as Captain Ahab , Daisy Miller , Isabel Archer , Huck Finn , and Hester Prynne or even such cinematic monuments as Charles Foster Kane and John Wayne 's Ethan Edwards in The Searchers , but they occupy a more personal , familial place in the fantasies of their admirers . They ca n't be laid to rest because , in ways both touching and frightening , they 've become incorporated into the personal lives and dreams of viewers and readers , living on in images mutated by memory and intertwined with desire . A Southern friend decided to read Rhett Butler 's People to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gone with the Wind , and she was ecstatic at the amplification. // " I did n't know all that about Rhett Butler 's background , it 's just fascinating , " she commented to her Northern daughter-in-law who ( spoilsport ) reminded her that they were not real people but fictional ones-you know , made up . Refusing to believe it , this bright and normally quick-witted matriarch summoned her sons to uphold the biographical veracity of Gone with the Wind . // To be fair , it does get confusing . In the venerable tradition of the historical novel , Margaret Mitchell throws in a few real names among her fictional characters . Alexander Stephens , the Georgia vice president of the Confederacy , congressman , and governor who inspired a fascinating chapter in Edmund Wilson 's Patriotic Gore , hovers in the wings . And Scarlett 's firstborn ( not in the movie ) is named after my great-great-grandfather Wade Hampton , the South Carolina general ( later governor ) whose cavalry Charles Hamilton gallops off to join at the outbreak of war . It is in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Scarlett pregnant with poor , puny Wade Hampton Hamilton . // There 's often a curious , very personal logic in the things people remember and misremember about the film . A middle-aged woman insisted to me that Melanie 's second child , the one whose miscarriage causes her death , was fathered by Rhett Butler . Beyond whatever interest this wildly eccentric fantasy might have for the woman 's psychiatrist , it recognizes the special and profoundly felt mutual respect in the Rhett-Melanie relationship , the exquisite balance between her shyness and his courtliness , that becomes conspiratorially intimate in the scenes where he breaks down and confides in her . Allowing them a moment of mutual gratification , however out of character , is the sort of interactive " intervention " that the book and movie have inspired , in this case to " make amends " to Rhett for the way he has suffered . // With something so embedded , even embalmed , in the public consciousness , the idea of an authorized sequel or a preapproved spin-off is a joke . Whatever the legal statutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of copyright lawyers , was a shrewd protector of her property ) , Gone with the Wind has long since passed into the public domain-does , indeed , belong to everyone . In 2008 , a year of bitter political feuding , Scarlett was invoked by columnists as a Hillary avant la lettre , the only heroine strong , bitchy , and relentless enough to compare with the I'm-no-lady senator 's aggressive take-no-prisoners campaign . In this way , Gone with the Wind ' s touchstones have become American folklore , part of the way we imagine our national self , not just indistinguishable from but overriding real history . Twelve Oaks and Tara are familiar tourist stops in our collective " memory " of the Old South . " I 'll think about that tomorrow " and " Tomorrow is another day " have , along with " Frankly , my dear , I do n't give a damn , " become catchphrases of the American vernacular . Scarlett 's seventeen-inch-waist and green velvet curtain dress are the stuff of parody . EBay lists an inexhaustible supply of memorabilia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his inflated claims and over-the-top enthusiasm , could have predicted Gone with the Wind ' s global reach and longevity , the way both movie and book caught on and grabbed audiences at so many levels and seemed at home in so many eras . // A large part of it was an accident of timing , a coinciding of war and the Depression . Though Mitchell began writing the book in 1926 , out of her own generation 's postwar spirit of rebellion , creating in Scarlett a Jazz Age heroine transplanted to the Civil War , when the book was finally finished and published in 1936 , with the movie following in 1939 , it was the Depression that weighed on everyone 's minds . According to the cards of the preview audiences , almost all saw the movie as a reflection of their own experience . To these viewers Gone with the Wind was both escape and parallel : a story of struggle and survival during a national catastrophe , but at a romantic remove . Scarlett 's evolution from seductress to woman of action exerted an enormous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wives who 'd had to take over in the absence of men and in a society that otherwise disapproved of women , especially married women , working . It was the woman 's angle that Kay Brown , Selznick 's canny assistant , responded to ; it was she who pushed for purchasing the movie rights and enlisted financier Jock Whitney on her side . // ( Continues ... ) //
