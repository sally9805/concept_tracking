Her obsession strained her marriage and left her family with more than $50,000 in debt . Now Kristine Rogers has a plan to get her life back on track . // KRISTINE ROGERS IS AN ADDICT . The 36-year-old suburban mother of four does n't drink , gamble or take drugs , but she is an addict nonetheless . Her compulsion is shopping , and her very particular obsession is Gymboree clothing-cute , colorful outfits for the 12-and-under set that , in Rogers ' hands , have catapulted her family into an emotional and financial tailspin . Rogers first recognized she 'd crossed the line from merely being an enthusiastic shopper to genuine illness about 18 months ago , when Gymboree held a clearance sale in which every item was priced at $7.99 . " I was literally shaking , trying to get my daughter dressed to get to the store , " Rogers recalls . " I went to three or four different stores that day , I had a friend on the phone going to a Gymboree near her to buy for me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my daughter did n't need . I bought four of the same coat in different colors . " By the end of the day , Rogers ' compulsion had cost her $800 . At the height of her addiction in 2003 and 2004 , Rogers estimates that she spent $400 a week and eight to 10 hours a day , every day , shopping for Gymboree outfits on the Web . " Online , it felt like Monopoly money , " she says . She 'd log on at 3 a.m. , stay on until her kids woke up , then start all over again once the older ones left for school . " I 'd get a rush , a physical high , " she says . " It got so bad that just thinking about shopping , I 'd start shaking . " Maxed-out credit cards , more than $50,000 in shopping-related debt and the slow realization that she chatted more with other Gymboree-obsessed moms than she did with her own family finally convinced Rogers that she needed to kick her habit . Last November she started a Gymboree-addiction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchases of $150 or so a month . She thinks the worst is over but adds , " I do n't know if I 'll ever be normal . " Meanwhile , her family struggles to untangle the financial mess her obsession has wrought . Kristine Rogers is not alone . Compulsive shopping affects up to 8% of the U.S. population , and 90% of those shopaholics are women . Some , like Rogers , zero in on one product or brand . Some shop in binges , others are equal-opportunity buyers who snap up whatever catches their fancy whenever the impulse occurs . Many focus their buying on someone else 's behalf-in Rogers ' case , her youngest daughter , Skylar , 3 . " Compulsive gift giving is a way of buying love , and you do n't have to feel so guilty about overspending , " says psychologist April Benson , editor of I Shop , Therefore I Am . The consequences , however , can be devastating , as Rogers and her family have learned . Like many addictions , shopaholism can break the family bank , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also suffer , as many shopaholics become both secretive and single-minded-their habit takes precedence over work and family , often leading to the loss of one or both . Whether one is a compulsive shopper depends on the feelings accompanying the act as well as the quantity purchased , the amount spent and the consequences . Habitually shopping to make yourself feel better is one possible sign of addiction . Consuming to the point of harming yourself-financially , socially , professionally-is another . Being unable to stop , despite these ramifications , is yet another . ( See " Five Signs You 're in Trouble " at right . ) THE LONG WAY DOWN For most of the past three years , Kristine Rogers has manifested all of these symptoms . Before that she did n't have the financial means . Rogers grew up in a middle-class home outside Chicago , a few miles from Yorkville , where she now lives with her husband Ari Epstein , 34 . But she hit hard times at 18 , when she got pregnant and married her high school sweetheart . By 25 she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 15 , and Alyssa , 10-and struggling to support her family with a series of low-paying jobs . In 1995 she was studying to become a paralegal when she had another setback : She could n't pay $12,000 in medical and repair bills she 'd incurred in a car accident and ended up filing for bankruptcy . Five years later she met Epstein , a recruiter at the legal staffing company where she worked . They got married in 2001 and decided they could afford to have Rogers quit her $38,000-a-year job and to live on Epstein 's $140,000 income . A year later Skylar , the future object of her obsession , was born . Rogers began shopping in earnest soon after . She started out innocently enough , perusing eBay for hard-to-find Christmas toys . She got hooked on buying online and was particularly taken with the coordinated head-to-toe outfits on the Gymboree website . Within six months Rogers was a full-blown addict , drawn as much by the community of shopping chat rooms as by the fabulous wardrobe she was amassing for her daughter . " All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but then it spins out of control . " For the first few months , her husband did n't notice his daughter 's bulging closets or the household 's bulging bills . Credit-card statements came in , Epstein sent checks out , and that was that . Rogers felt increasingly guilty and remorseful as her purchases and her time away from the kids increased . Still , she could n't stop . Eventually Epstein caught on . " I remember thinking it was insane , " he says . " She was always on those websites . I just did n't get it . Why did we need all those socks and hair bows ? " Although he did n't confront his wife , she felt his watchful eye and began hiding her purchases . Eventually , though , their rapidly shrinking bank account convinced Epstein he had to say something-first calmly , then with threats to shut down her accounts . Last summer the situation came to a head . The couple had borrowed $28,000 from Epstein 's mother several months before to help pay off more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were in the hole again for $26,000 . When Epstein 's mother called to ask about a small payment to her that they 'd missed , he flipped out . He ran to Skylar 's closet and pulled out a new Gymboree dress . Then , he says , " I took a pair of scissors and hacked at it . I just could n't handle it anymore . " TWO TO TANGO Not all of the couple 's financial woes , however , can be traced back to Rogers ' love affair with Gymboree . In 2002 , Epstein had switched recruiting firms to take a managerial position . The move unexpectedly resulted in a cut in pay , from $140,000 to $70,000 , when the recruiting market dried up and his anticipated commission income did n't materialize . But the couple continued to live as if he were still earning six figures-eating out at expensive restaurants once or twice a week , taking in Cubs games and attending big-name rock concerts . Rogers thinks her husband 's expenditures make up a big part of their debt . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reckless . I might have spent $400 on baseball tickets or $150 on dinner once in a while , but now I do n't buy anything . " With blame swatted back and forth as fast as an Olympic Ping-Pongball , it 's not surprising that no one in the family was keepingtrack of the finances . " I have n't balanced my checkbook in four years , " confesses Epstein . Add a staggering $600 to $700 a month in bank overdraft fees to their mountain of debt . ROAD TO RECOVERY As painful as the dress-shredding incident was , the confrontation was an important turning point , forcing the couple to acknowledge their financial and emotional crisis . In the aftermath , they began taking action to turn their lives around . In January , Epstein , a former lawyer , took a new , higher-paying job as the division manager of the legal recruiting department for a major employment firm . Rogers started her Gymboree recovery site , offering advice and " no buying " contests to other shopping addicts . She 's since slashed her Gymboree spending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work part time as a paralegal . She also took over balancing the checkbook , and their overdraft fees are now largely gone . But the last few years have taken their financial toll . The couple are saddled with five maxed-out credit cards at interest rates as high as 28% ( punitive rates levied as a result of too many missed payments ) , unpaid utility bills totaling more than $1,500 and a house that they rent , and they have scant savings . In June , Rogers and Epstein agreed that a meeting with Kevin Holland , a C.P.A. and financial planner in Naperville , Ill. , was a good idea . THE ADVICE Despite the couple 's dire financial straits , Holland is optimistic that they can pay off their credit-card debt within five to seven years and even save enough money to buy a home . Here is what he recommends . Cut expenses further The more cash Rogers and Epstein can free up to put toward their credit cards , the faster they 'll climb out of debt and start saving for the future . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did target a few areas for cutbacks : entertainment and dining out ( $7,500 ) , dance lessons ( $5,000 ) , cell phones ( $2,400 ) and his health-club membership ( $950 ) . " For a while at least , try living as if you 're just coming out of high school and are dirt poor , " he recommends . Renegotiate debt Holland says the couple should first pay off their $1,500 utility bill so their power is n't cut off . At the same time , they should try to bargain with their credit-card issuers to reduce those punitive interest rates , and perhaps their outstanding balances as well . Epstein reveals he once made a deal with MBNA , to which they now owe $12,000 at 28% interest , and the company agreed to knock off a sizable amount of his debt if he 'd pay at least $200 every month . When he missed a payment , MBNA rescinded the offer . Holland says Epstein should see if they 'll reinstate the offer . " Then you go to the other credit-card companies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the couple gets the rate down to an average 18% from 28% , they 'll save $17,000 in interest and pay off their debt nearly two years sooner . Save for the future Next year , when Epstein becomes eligible for a 401(k) , Holland urges him to contribute enough to qualify for his company 's match . " Do whatever it takes-it 's free money , " the planner says . The couple should also supplement the $50,000 in life insurance Epstein gets for free at work . Holland suggests they each get a 15-year level-term policy with a $500,000 death benefit . The cost : about $30 a month for both . Stay sober None of the moves that Holland recommends will help , however , if Rogers relapses . To keep straight , Rogers must stay off Gymboree websites and out of the stores for the next several months , until she has a handle on her obsession , advises financial coach Kathy Miller , author of Too Busy to Budget . " If you 're a recovering alcoholic , you would n't go into a bar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miller also encourages Rogers to keep up her website , noting , " It 's a good transition for her to go from being someone who needs help to being someone who can offer help . " Rogers herself is cautiously optimistic about her recovery . Recently , she stood at the entrance of her garage and surveyed the lineup of 18-gallon plastic tubs that contain hundreds of Skylar 's outgrown coordinated outfits , carefully folded . " Looking at all this stuff reminds me of my addiction , " she says , her voice choking . " I just want to get rid of it all . " Sidebar Three-year-old Skylar 's closet is overflowing with Gymboree outfits . Once the chain extended its line to older kids , Rogers began shopping there for Alyssa , 10 , as well .
