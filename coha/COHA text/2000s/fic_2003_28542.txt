Chapter One March Boswell , Colorado " You making time with your sweetheart again , Dixie ? " " That ai n't his sweetheart . That 's his baby girl . Right , Dixie ? " Dixon Bell just grinned at the cowboys ' teasing and kept walking at a slow , easy pace toward the three unbroken horses poised along one curve of the corral . The buckskin and the pinto danced away as he got close . The black quarter horse mare knew him , though , and had come to trust him a little . Ears twitching , tail flicking , she watched him approach . She was nervous , sure . But willing to give him a chance . " Hey , there , gorgeous , " he crooned , coming to a stop by her shoulder . He put a hand on the smooth , warm skin of her neck . " Thanks for waiting for me . How 's it going ? " She turned her head toward him , nosed his arm and chest , then jerked away as the buckskin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , eyes wide , the mare warned the other horse off . " No need to be jealous , sweetheart . " Dixon chuckled as he stroked his palm along her back . " I 've only got eyes for you . " Talking quietly , he ran his hands over her ribs , her flanks , her chest , combed his fingers through her jet-black mane . As she calmed , he bent to stroke her legs , lifting each foot in turn , all the time praising her for standing still , for letting him have his way . Then he straightened up and allowed the halter he 'd hooked over his shoulder to drop down to his hand . " Remember this ? " He held it under her nose , watched her sniff . " We got this on yesterday . Let 's try again . " She was n't happy about it , but did finally let him slip the soft halter over her nose and ears . Left to run wild in the Colorado hills since her birth two years ago , she had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he hooked the lead rope to the halter , the mare eventually consented to be led around the corral without too much fuss ... as long as the buckskin kept her distance . This quarter horse was n't interested in sharing her man with anybody else . " She 'll make a good mount , " the ranch foreman commented when Dixon left the corral . " You 're sure taking your time , though . There 's easier , quicker ways to break a horse . " " I 'm not interested in easier and quicker , " Dixon told him . " Usually that means some kind of pain for the animal . I 'm content to take things slow , exercise a little patience . " " Next thing we know , you 'll be hugging trees . " The foreman gave him a friendly punch in the arm as they parted ways . Dixon returned the halter to the barn and headed to the bunkhouse to wash up for dinner . The aroma of grilled meat hung in the dry mountain air , teasing him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at dawn , heading out to round up cows and calves , and the only food he 'd managed all day was a quick sandwich at lunch . Hungry was n't a big enough word for the emptiness inside him tonight . A stop at the mailbox on his way in rewarded him with a letter from home . Dixon delayed the pleasure until he 'd changed into a clean shirt and jeans and washed his hands . Then he sat on his bunk to read what his grandmother , Miss Daisy Crawford , had to say . She wrote , on lavender-scented paper in an old-fashioned , flowing script , of her friends , her neighbors , the civic meetings she went to , the goings-on at church . One of her cats had been sick , some kind of kidney problem , but the vet prescribed a new diet which seemed to be working . The weather had been strange this year - variably cold and hot - so she never knew what to wear when she went out . Finally , I thought you might want to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . L. T. LaRue - whom I would designate a scalawag , if there were still such a thing - up and left his family a few weeks ago . Moved out of their house and into a love nest with his office secretary , declaring to the world his intention to get a divorce and marry this girl young enough to be his daughter . I taught her in Sunday School just a few years ago ; I ca n't imagine what could have happened to bring her to such a state . This domestic tragedy leaves Kate LaRue - she was Kate Bowdrey , as I 'm sure you recall - alone to take care of two teenagers . Poor Kate , she 's struggled to put up with that man these ten years , even adopted his children , and look what he 's gone and done to her . Some men just are not to be relied upon . Dixon read those next-to-last paragraphs several times , then sat staring at his grandmother 's pale-blue stationery without seeing the words written there . His brain had latched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a divorce . That meant she would n't be married anymore . As in single . Unattached . Available . And that meant the time had come for him to go home . July New Skye , North Carolina With a clap of thunder , the sky broke open . Raindrops pelted the pavement and windows like bullets . Caught unprotected as she locked her car door , Kate LaRue shrieked and dashed for the nearest cover , which happened to be the green-and-white striped awning of Drew 's Coffee Shop . She was drenched when she got there , of course , her thin linen top practically transparent , her skirt hanging heavy around her waist . Water squished between her sandals and the soles of her feet . " What a mess , " she muttered as she pulled her shirt away from her bra , only to have it stick again . Around her , the smell of wet pavement blended with the pungent scent of coffee brewing inside the caf . " I 'll have to go back home and change . " " Beautiful day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar , came from behind . " There 's nothing like a southern rainstorm to clear the dust out of the air . " Kate turned to look at the tall , lean man standing with a shoulder propped against the brick wall that framed Drew 's window . " You 're joking , right ? " He had a wide , white grin in a tanned face . " Not at all . After a few years of eating dirt in the west Texas oil fields , I appreciate a good rain . " " You do n't sound like you 're from Texas . " In fact , he sounded as if he 'd lived right here in New Skye , North Carolina , his whole life . She should know him , Kate was sure . But good manners forbade that she just out and ask him what his name was . " Thank goodness . I 'd hate to be identified by my twang . " He straightened up to his full , lanky height . " Would you like to step inside and get a drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand , he directed her to the entrance of Drew 's , where she was certain he would open the door for her . Suddenly , just from the way he looked at her , she was equally certain he knew exactly who she was . She studied him for a long moment , searching for a clue in the rich , brown waves of his hair , the glint in his dark eyes , the tilt of his head . When the answer swam up from the depths of her memory , she caught her breath at the impossible rightness of it . " Dixon ? Dixon Bell ? " His grin widened . " Took you long enough . " He put his hands on her shoulders and leaned in to kiss her cheek . " I was beginning to think I 'd have to show you my driver 's license . How are you , Kate ? " Without thinking , she threw her arms around his neck and hugged him tight . " You 've been gone so long . Welcome home ! " She felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt the wall of his chest against her breasts . His shoulders were wide and strong . He smelled of starch and soap . And man . ( Continues ... )
