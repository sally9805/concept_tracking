One weekend , three girlfriends joined forces to tackle'an apartment renovation . They started with a shopping trip to round up last-minute supplies , and four gallons of paint and umpteen cups of coffee later , their commitment resulted in this airy pied -- terre . Let 's Freshen Up This Place My city apartment looked sad . It needed a lift badly ! But I did n't have a lot of time or money to spend . So , promising great food , wine , and lots of laughs , I invited two friends , each a designer in her own right , to assist me . I was project manager , and at 5 ' 10 ' ' , did the " tall " work . The girls worked like bees . Darlene mostly refinishcd furniture , sewed , and stenciled . Elizabeth mostly painted , assembled furniture , and kept us tidy and organized . In addition to this core trio , a stream of curious pals dropped by offering help . They came with pillows , an ironing board , even sushi . It was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still .

Benjamin Moore 's Super White freshens a 30-year-old Saarinen table . A lively patterned and completely washable plastic floor mat brings so much joy underfoot . The Cleanup . This can be total drudgery , unless the chaos is continuously kept in check . Elizabeth , self-appointed dirt-duty girl , understood this theory of containment . When she chided me for tracking wet paint across the floor . I did n't take it personally ! My favorite cleaning supplies for my 400-square-foot pad : the Swifter ; Windex ; paper towels ; mildly abrasive sponges ; Bon Ami : and a wet/dry Hoover Floormate . Honorable mention : rubber gloves and a pretty apron . reward all those who pitch in and help . " On set . " I showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lunch from Whole Foods ( left ) , turned the ironing board into a bar at 6 P.M. sharp , and kept a giant pump of Aveda hand cream at the ready . Girls will be girls-tool belts , sanders , and all . " prop kit " . Darlene stashes her craft supplies in this roomy hard-body vintage suitcas because it looks great , is easy to travel with , and I big enough for a girl-on-the-go 's glue gun , t-pins , ribbons , fine art brushes , and rollers ( paint , not hair ) . TIRED OF TOOLING AROUND ? Get organized . Invest in a good tool kit(s) or assemble your own based on your needs . Home-repair wise girl Barbara K gears her kits for women . The 30-piece kit ( above right ) features tools that snap into place . I love the practical magnetic 10-foot tape measure ; I keep mine on the fridge !

A Sensible Strategy . The window treatments were past due ; the neutral walls , simply boring . This space clearly needed an infusion of energy . I chose a palette of blue , white , and natural-always fresh and calm-and added shimmer for some swank . It also needed to be a low-maintenance retreat . That meant holding my clutter gene in check and keeping collections to a minimum . FOLDING TABLE : BYER OF MAINE . CHAIR : GREAT STUFF BY PAUL . THE DETAILS Every design detail was conceived for maximum effect with the fewest objects . Delighted by the Fortuny wall stencil , Darlene applied the same savvy to a slipcovered stool ( left ) . For accessories ( right ) , I mixed thrift-store finds , earthy and refined , for fun tabletop compositions . SEQUIN FLOWERS : ANOKHA. the whole process : We voted on design issues , rotated chores and split tasks , made some mistakes . Our priorities , however , remained aligned . 1 . Say buh-bye to all that old stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This is your opportunity to start fresh ! 2 . To ensure best results , spackie and sand the walls and any furniture that needs refinishing . Clean up dust . 3 . Start painting . Ceiling first , followed by walls . A drop cloth and painter 's tape will shorten cleanup time . 4 . Place furniture , starting with anchor pieces . Lay rugs ; place accessories . 5 . What 's done is done . Clean it . then leave it and go out with your friends ! budget decorating . Yes . it 's possible !

Gauzy curtains filter the sunlight beautifully . Adding velvet ribbon trim makes a custom touch . Fitted with shams and velvet bolsters , Simmqns ' mattress and box spring can function as a " sofa . " When not employed as seating , this Ikea stool scoots under the Lack side table . Serenity now . Chocolate proved to be a soothing color for the bedroom , especially in contrast to an entourage of pristine vanilla furnishings , which my grandfather 's old bedroom chest would soon join . I was tired of the dark cherry finish , but for financial and nostalgic reasons I could n't part with this sensible nine-drawer storage piece . Painting it white was the solution . 1 Darlene liked Black &; Decker 's hand-friendly Mouse sander , which she used to take the former finish of the chest down a notch . 2 Restoration Hardware @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so prominent in the living room , into the bedroom . 3 This glass hardware sparkles against the white surface .
