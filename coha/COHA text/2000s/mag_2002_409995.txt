The Democrats on Social Security reform <p> For Social Security reformers , the good news is how quickly the public has moved forward . People have become more receptive to the idea of investing some of their Social Security payments themselves . Exit polls from the 2000 election found that 57 percent of voters supported that reform . The bear market has cut that support , but only a little . The bad news , though , is that reform is going to have to win the backing of a significant number of congressional Democrats to get enacted . And the Democrats-even their best and brightest-are moving backward . <p> Most liberals have never supported a free-market overhaul of Social Security . In the past , though , many of them were at least willing to concede that the program was ailing . Reining in entitlements was even something of a good-government liberal cause , especially as liberals worried that runaway spending for the elderly was crowding out other federal programs they wanted . <p> Then two things happened . First , liberals lost political power-and it became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ popularity of federal entitlements . President Clinton came back from the irrelevance to which the 1994 elections had seemingly consigned him by depicting Republicans as a threat to Medicare . Second , conservatives began to dominate the debate over how to solve Social Security 's problems . As the prospect of a reform based on personal investment has drawn nearer , liberals have started digging in their heels . <p> The Democrats ' resistance to reform , and the lengths to which their court economists will go to rationalize that resistance , was on exhibit in July , when President Bush 's commission on Social Security released the draft of its preliminary report . Alan Blinder , a Clinton appointee to the Federal Reserve and an adviser to Al Gore last year , told the Washington Post that the report " tries to create a sense of crisis when there is n't a crisis . " He added , " It is irresponsible to frighten people . " Robert Matsui , a Democratic congressman from California , said that the commission should be disbanded . <p> New York Times columnist Paul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the report 's critics : He called it " sheer , mean-spirited nonsense . " Lest anyone miss his point-to judge from his repetitiveness , this appears to be a constant fear of Krugman's-his next column called the report " biased , internally inconsistent and intellectually dishonest . " Blinder joined three other heavyweight liberal economists-Henry Aaron , Alicia Munnell , and Peter Orszag-to issue a report of their own , which reached the same conclusions without Krugman 's table-pounding . <p> One of the commission 's conclusions exercised the liberals more than any other : the claim that the existence of a " Social Security Trust Fund " does nothing to improve the program 's solvency . The issue may seem arcane , but it is in fact decisive , so bear with me for a minute . For about two decades , the payroll taxes that fund Social Security have brought in more revenues than the program spends on benefits . Until 1999 , those excess funds were used to finance the rest of the federal budget . Now that the rest of the budget is in surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the federal debt . But however the money has been used-to spend on other programs or to pay off debt-the Treasury has always borrowed it from Social Security and , in return , credited the program with bonds . These Treasury bonds make up the Social Security Trust Fund . <p> Because the number of retirees keeps rising , it is projected that by 2016 the payroll tax will no longer bring in surplus revenues . By then , the trust fund should have accumulated bonds worth more than $3 trillion ( in today 's dollars ) . From then on , Social Security will have to draw on the trust fund to keep paying benefits . It will keep drawing on it until 2038 , when the trust fund will finally run out . <p> So there 's no problem until then , right ? Wrong . What the president 's commission points out is that the bonds are " not accumulated reserves of wealth but only promises that future taxpayers will be asked to redeem . " It concludes , " The Trust Fund can neither delay the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need by a dollar . " <p> It is this point that leaves the liberals sputtering . The bonds in the trust fund are " legally backed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government , " note Henry Aaron &; Co . " Social Security 's bonds are just as ' real ' as the Treasury bonds held by private investors . The fact that these bonds are ' paper ' assets does not in any way reduce their value . " It is " dangerous " to suggest otherwise . Krugman argues that nobody would deny that the trust fund held real assets if it were full of German bonds , and that it is therefore absurd to suggest that it does n't because it holds American ones . <p> These people are all smart , but their argument is stupid . If you 've loaned money to someone else , you can look forward to getting that money back ( with interest ) to pay for something . If you 've loaned money to yourself , you ca n't . Is that really so hard to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will repay the bonds ; it 's pointing out that repaying the bonds will require the government to raise taxes , cut spending , or both . It does n't matter if the trust fund has $3 trillion in bonds or $300 trillion-paying for Social Security is going to start being a problem in 2016 . <p> In tandem with their argument about the bonds , the liberal economists make a second point that is not ridiculous . Their reasoning : The trust fund represents years of surplus revenues from Social Security . Those revenues reduced the budget deficit for years , and now they are reducing the federal debt . Thus they have been adding to national saving , which contributes to economic growth , which in turn makes it easier to pay for future Social Security benefits . <p> This argument has the merit of not pretending that the bonds will somehow pay themselves back after 2016 . ( It just skates by the question of how to pay for them . ) But it has several weaknesses . There is , for one thing , substantial dispute over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Stronger economic growth , in addition , does not make it much easier to pay for Social Security . As the commission report explains , the program 's benefit levels are tied to wages . The stronger economic growth is , the higher wages , and therefore benefits , are . <p> In addition , whether excess payroll-tax revenues have really improved the federal government 's finances is highly questionable . It is at least as plausible to think that for most of the last two decades , the influx of these revenues to Washington simply led Congress to spend more . Only in the last couple of years has a political taboo against " raiding the Social Security surplus " made it impossible to spend the extra money . If the Social Security surplus was spent from 1983 to 1999 , in no sense do most of the bonds in the trust fund represent increased national saving . ( The four liberal economists ' report raises this possibility only to dismiss it . ) <p> What 's suspicious about the Democratic intellectuals ' attack on Social Security reform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding of the issues . In January 1999 , Henry Aaron testified before the Senate Budget Committee that the trust fund " may have failed in adding to national saving , if it caused government to run larger deficits or smaller surpluses on the rest of its activities . " ( If so , he added , this was the fault of " unwise fiscal policy outside Social Security " rather than of the trust fund-a point that gets us nowhere . ) <p> Peter Orszag said , in testimony before a House subcommittee last year , that the trust fund may not have increased saving-at least until the advent in 1999 of the " lockbox " to protect the Social Security surplus . In 1984 , Alicia Munnell co-wrote an article for the New England Economic Review citing " the improbability that Social Security surpluses will increase national saving " in arguing that the surplus should be reduced . The authors wrote that their " best guess was that the scheduled buildup of assets in the Social Security trust funds over the next 35 years would be used to offset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little to overall saving and capital accumulation . " <p> Krugman , too , has made an about-face . In 1988 he was careful to mention that Social Security surpluses would help finance the program 's future only if they were " not offset by deficits in the remainder of the federal budget . " Now he does n't even acknowledge the possibility that this may have happened . <p> It 's not just liberal economists who have forgotten what they used to know . Robert Matsui , the Democratic congressman , has led the charge on the Hill against the commission . In July , he said : " This report falsely asserts that the Social Security system will be unable to meet its obligations because the assets held by the Trust Fund are ' not real . ' To the contrary , the Government bonds held by Social Security are as real and valuable as the Treasury bonds held by millions of private investors . " These comments , of course , follow the economists ' current analysis . <p> In 1990 , however , Matsui and Democratic senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ described the trust fund in terms more slighting than anything the commission has said : " Bluntly put , the federal government is spending more than $1 billion a week of the Social Security surplus as though it were general revenues . All that the Trust Fund gets for these expenditures are chits from the U.S. Treasury . " The fund was merely " a vault full of Treasury Department IOUs . " <p> Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt were clear-eyed in the past , too . In 1996 , journalist Robert Novak grilled Daschle about the trust fund and got him to admit that " there is no such fund per se . " In 1990 , Gephardt said that by 2015 or so taxes would have to be increased to pay off the bonds in the trust fund . Now , Gephardt is accusing the commission of trying to " scare people " by questioning the value of the trust fund . <p> Better to scare people , perhaps , than to lull them into false complacency . By treating the trust fund as a way of paying for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four economists is able to say that the program 's remaining shortfall is only 1.86 percent of wages that are subject to taxation . The clear implication : Raise payroll taxes by less than 2 percent , and the problem disappears for at least 75 years . But that implication , as we have seen , is false : It ignores the need to raise enough money to pay off more than $3 trillion worth of bonds . <p> Having labored to make the current system look more sustainable than it is , the gang of four goes on to stack the deck against personal accounts as a component of a solution . They estimate , incredibly , that allowing people to invest 2 percent of their wages would " divert " so much money from Social Security that young people would get 50 percent lower benefits . ( Okay , class : Raise your hand if you think President Bush is going to propose a 50 percent cut in benefits . ) It takes two statistical maneuvers to yield this daunting figure . First , they refuse to count the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reduction look at least 30 points greater than it should . <p> Second , they do n't stop at estimating the cuts in benefits from the old system that would be required to make room for personal accounts . They add in all the cuts it would take to completely eliminate Social Security 's pre-existing funding shortfall . The current program 's funding problem , in other words , is attributed to the proposed reform of it . They 're using a double standard . A hypothetical reform plan has to pass the most stringent of tests . But the gang of four argues at length that the unreformed Social Security system should be evaluated not on the basis of the benefits it can pay for , but of the benefits it has promised . <p> What was that Paul Krugman said about intellectual dishonesty ? <p> By Ramesh Ponnuru <p>
