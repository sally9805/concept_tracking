How long we waited : Tom and I were planning to have sex again right after my six-week follow-up appointment ( when the doctor gives the official okay ) , but it did n't happen until two days later because we were so busy and tired . The evening it did happen , we were able to sit down and eat dinner together . Tom cooked , which made it all the better . That and the grown-up conversation were enough to get me in the mood . HOW I felt ! I was excited but also nervous about what it would be like . It was definitely different-I 'd had an episiotomy , so it hurt , but changing positions , a little Astroglide , and a lot of patience ( on both our parts ) helped . Still , physically speaking , on a scale of 1 to 10 , I 'd have to rate it a 1.5 . Where my mind was : A lot of the time , I was totally distracted . Whenever I closed my eyes , I thought I heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was sound asleep in the next room . I also kept thinking , " I really should be catching up on sleep right now or cleaning up that mess in the kitchen . " It was awful to be so ready to enjoy the moment and then have my mind wander . How my husband handled it : He was wonderful-having watched the birth , he had a whole new respect for my body . He was gentle and cautious and asked how I was feeling . To try to make things better , he gave me a little back massage to relax me and suggested different positions . So even though the experience was n't so great physically , at least for me , the intimacy and renewed connection with Tom helped make up for it . How I felt about my body : I was very self-conscious . I wore a bra with thick nursing pads so I would n't leak ( talk about unsexy ) , my stomach felt like risen bread dough , and I had n't had my hair cut or colored in almost six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respond , but he said he loved my new curves . What I 'd do differently : I 'd talk to Tom about my apprehension beforehand . Even though we communicated once things got going , we had to put on the brakes and slow things down . My body and mind needed lots of time to warm up , and I think the night would 've felt less like an experiment if I 'd shared my feelings earlier . The second time we had sex : More time passed than I 'd like to admit-we waited almost another month . It 's just one of those things that moves to the bottom of the priority list when you 're a new parent . But as time went on , it got better . Words of wisdom : be patient with yourself-it 'll take some time before it starts to feel totally comfortable again . It took me a few months . And have a glass of wine beforehand ! - INTERVIEW BY MARISA MAEYAMA " It was great to share some one-on-one time after weeks of devoting every moment to our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
