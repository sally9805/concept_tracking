One thing being a rock star gets you is an apartment the size of the Pentagon . O.K. , not the Pentagon . Elton John 's place in Atlanta is only 18,000 sq . ft. , about the size of everything you and all your friends live in put together . But that 's still a lot of wall space , which you need if you 're Elton John . Ten years ago , around the time he established his U.S. foothold in Atlanta ( he also has houses in London and Nice and one of those rolling country estates in Old Windsor , England ) , Sir Elton , as he is properly called , also discovered photographs . Several million dollars and much shopping later , he has one of the larger private collections in the world . <P> One other thing stardom gets you is a genuine art-world institution to show your little treasures , or 380 of them , which is what the High Museum of Art in Atlanta is doing with John 's photographs , until Jan. 28 . However much exhibits like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a venerable form of donor courtship . It 's fair to say that the trustees of the High would n't mind if Sir Elton were to will them every bit of this collection someday . ( They must hold their breath every time he tells the press how much he would love to see a photography museum established in London . ) But if they covet his holdings , who can blame them ? This is a collection few museums could just go out and buy . Auction and gallery prices for photos have been rising steeply , in part because of buyers like John . Seven years ago , he bid up the price of Glass Tears , Man Ray 's landmark caprice from 1932 , to $190,000 , then a record for any photograph bought at auction . His collection is more than 2,000 prints and climbing . And it 's not bad . <P> Scratch a collector , and you find a pack rat who likes to play librarian . As a teenager Elton bought rock records extravagantly , then organized them with Prussian efficiency , filing them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he loaded up on the usual blunder acquisitions of new-money collectors . ( What was it exactly that baby boomers saw in Art Nouveau posters and Tiffany lamps ? ) Most of that he sold off some years ago in the mental and physical housecleaning that accompanied his decision to stop drinking . Then he went to lunch in France , somebody showed him some prints by Horst , and he was off and running . <P> Like most collections , this one amounts to a fan 's notes , not an encyclopedic survey . It contains almost nothing from the 19th century , and the 20th century inventory is light on landscape and street photography , heavy on fashion and portraiture . But it 's a highly credible assortment , brainy and fun , with samples from most of the major episodes of 20th century photography . There 's a fair selection of greatest hits  --  Edward Steichen 's 1924 portrait of Gloria Swanson behind a scrim of black lace , Dorothea Lange 's inevitable Migrant Mother of 1936  --  and some less familiar examples by big names . Everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one here , from 1927 , which turns a pair of legs , tightly folded at the knees , into nestled loaves of Italian bread .
