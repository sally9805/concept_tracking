With made-to-measure dresses and Park Avenue reputations at stake , the Social X-Ray set find gaining a few pounds is more than an inconvenience . David Colman investigates the world of couture dieting. // Consider the following three questions , which I have pondered for years , not as a quiz but as a summary of American life . Why is the sky blue How can I make more money ? How do so many socialites stay so skinny ? I 've found answers to the first two ; respectively : atmospheric refraction of sunlight and work . But the last had always eluded me-seeming to defy the laws of statistics , nature , and physics in one fell swoop , like a Zen koan for modern life . But this year I found myself plagued by a fourth question , far more pressing in the most painfully literal sense . Why  --  or  --  how did I gain so much weight after I quit smoking ? And that 's how I discovered the answer to it comes to vices , vanity is among the most inconsequential , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and at least offers the merit of bringing some beauty to the eye of the beholder . Vanity , not Sweet " N Low , is the sugar substitute that helps the pounds stay off and the dress fit . This was the foremost lesson I learned during my time drinking from one of the most private watering holes of that otherwise gregarious animal , the socialite . On the top floors of an unassuming townhouse in the southern skirts of Manhattan 's Upper East Side , I found the socialite 's secret weapon . It 's not a clever dressmaker who can knock off any couture creation , nor an extreme yoga studio or a plastic surgeon . It 's Robert S. Levine , M.D. His office , on East 62nd Street , is the couturier equivalent of Weight Watchers . I had heard about this magical doctor at dinner parties here and there . But it was n't until a friend put it to me in the most basic terms- " He is the reason all those ladies on Park Avenue stay so skinny " - that I asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were the top-secret password to a very exclusive club , but not before she added this disclaimer : // " He 's probably a total quack . But everyone who goes to him loses weight . " My kind of quack . At any rate , I did n't have much choice . I had tried the Atkins Diet , which did n't work . Working out had n't helped either . Yoga was ineffective . So , why not ask for pointers from an adviser to the professionally thin ? Levine himself is about as professional  --  strength as you can imagine . He charges $60 per session and wants patients to come in once a week for progress reports . He 's a sharp , direct , sarcastic man-and that 's a diplomatic description . On more than one visit , the waiting-room discussion revolved around how mean he is . The unisex , one-diet-fits-all menu he doles out seems stingy by comparison to other regimens that let you eat all the kelp or bacon you want as long as you do n't have this or that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coddling . The Levine diet is designed for people who have to go out constantly , so there 's little that 's verboten . If you get served something fattening , he says , just eat half of it . He 's not interested in hearing about how ( or why ) you found it impossible to eat only half . According to him , if you want to lose weight , you will eat only half End of discussion . He administers vitamin-B shots to patients ( since vitamin-B complex is used in metabolic functions ) on their weekly visits and prescribes a very mild appetite suppressant : These pills kill enough hunger that I found myself wanting to eat a small , healthy meal , but not so much that I felt like going without eating ( which is a dangerous dieting pitfall , as we all know ) . Levine 's vitamin shots and prescription drugs may be controversial , but his gimmick-free core strategy-eat less , weigh less-is , after all , the only foolproof weight loss method around . I had to write down everything I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know you 'll have to write something down , you 're less likely to want it ) and return weekly to be weighed and yelled at . There were some sidelights in his program-no carbonated beverages ( his pet theory is that gasses in the gastrointestinal tract increase the absorption of calories ) , endless vitamin B ( the shots plus two horse-size multivitamin pills a day ) , no ketchup ( who knows ? ) . Also , I did n't have to exercise at all unless I wanted to . Guess what ? I did n't want to . And to and behold , it began to work . Two pounds the first week , three the next , another three the next ... the weight started coming off steadily . Within a month I had lost 12 pounds ; within two months , I had lost 25 . I had adopted a new diet of fish or chicken and vegetables , with few sweets and starches . I had turned into a 1950s-era socialite . Even the doctor was impressed , which was no small feat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Levine was firm : " Thirty , " he said at our first meeting . When I had lost 30 , I took off my clothes again . " You can lose 10 or 15 more , " he said . I felt terrible , and he softened as much as to say , " Hey , you 've done good work . But you 're not as big a guy as I thought ; your frame is actually slender . " And then he told me something I was glad he had n't told me at first : " When you walked in here , I did n't think you had a chance at losing it . " He said I had seemed too wishy-washy and defeatist about losing weight . ( Which was ironic , because I had thought that I would n't respond to someone so gruff and mean . ) The last 10 pounds were a lot harder than the first 30 , taking almost the same amount of time-about 10 weeks . But I 've tried a good many diets over the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less has unequivocally worked the best of all . And so far , so good . The weight has stayed off , even without the pills . What has helped keep the weight off , too , is the happiness of being able to fit into all my old clothes ( and lots and lots of new ones ) . Like I said , the real weight-loss trick is vanity . I am now exactly in the middle of my height 's healthy weight range , and being thin tastes far better than any brand of ice cream . Kind of like revenge , but sweeter . <p>
