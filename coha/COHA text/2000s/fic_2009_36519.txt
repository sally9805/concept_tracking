Smoke hurled itself up out of a field a couple of miles to the north , toward Shanksville . Up ahead was a white farmhouse with a crooked chimney and , nearer the road , a boy and a dog staring , the boy 's hand on the dog 's head like a piece of Americana hokum . <p> Phoebe said , " If that 's a controlled burn , they 've lost control of it . " <p> Dana said , " It 's the wrong color for a burn . " <p> They were side-by-side on the backseat of the limo , both still stupefied by the fumes that poured from the collapsing towers on their TV screens not two hours ago . Dana thought of the crematorium where they were headed ; and it also came to her that the smoke out the window-not mushroom shaped but rather like an oak in summer , thick trunked and burgeoning-was the color called taupe or mole , which is a good color for the upholstery of a mortuary limousine ( her fingers splayed on the seat beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . <p> But the possibility did not occur to her that the ash was mixed with Pennsylvania dirt and limestone spewed from a thirty-foot crater made by the nose cone of a plane where another forty-four had been pulverized . It was only later , when she understood her place as an incidental widow-her experience , whatever it would have been , shunted aside by general catastrophe-that she thought how one thing follows on another , how nothing keeps something else from happening , how foolishly we suppose that we have earned respite , that Armageddon will not be followed by emergency , that because the car is totaled the pipes wo n't burst . <p> A mirror was mounted on the window between them and the driver-mourners need to check their mascara-and it gave back her blanched face , brown hair lopped at the chin , regular and unremarkable features except for a full , mobile mouth , out of which it would ( and did ) surprise anyone to hear an acerbic remark . A good face for a politician 's wife . Whereas her friend Phoebe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black coif and high color , interesting bones . Wit fit her . It was Phoebe who wore the mascara . <p> Dana said , " What if I threw a funeral and nobody came ? " <p> And Phoebe : " Do you want to cancel ? " <p> At which Dana lifted her hands far enough off the upholstery to suggest the pointlessness ; and Phoebe let out her disconsolate bark of a laugh , and the limo hit pothole after pothole on the weatherbeaten turnpike west toward Somerset . <p> She had hated him , and then he died . <p> No , it was more complicated than that . They had met in college , bantered , flirted , become infatuated , married , and were disillusioned ; then he slowly came to disregard her , and they lost a baby , and she came to dislike and then to scorn him , until shockingly before his fortieth birthday he was diagnosed with an already-metastasized colon cancer , and she nursed him gently , dutifully , until he died . <p> No , but it was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer remember reminded her of her father ( who was also a Republican , though in midcentury mode ) . At Pitt he had financed himself by inventing a kind of dating service for potential roommates . His entrepreneurial enthusiasm was ( like her father 's ) infectious . He got in on the business side of a nerd-rich software start-up , and when OmniOptions , Inc. , went public he took his cut and his place on the board and went public also , into the Somerset County Council and then into the State Senate . He was still a banterer , and Dana only gradually realized that the banter was always at someone 's expense , and that banter is not the same thing as conversation , and that the cleverness he most admired tended toward spin and scam . <p> She was not a bad politician 's wife . Art history is a classy background with no threat attached . She 'd spent most of her childhood in the backseat of a Chevy Malibu and knew how to be still while bored . She could cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to talk too long to anyone . Through two campaigns and two terms in Harrisburg , she did volunteer things that were good for Graham 's career without committing her to one of her own , mostly in libraries and children 's wards ; and she supposed she would be a stay-at-home mother when the time came to stay at home . <p> She got at last joyfully pregnant , but faltered in the third trimester with toxemia . Her calves and ankles swelled . She was hospitalized at thirty weeks and gave birth a week later to a girl-they named her Chloe-whose heart was faulty and who died at two days old . <p> Since she had known , held , watched Chloe for less than forty hours , people , including Graham , supposed the trauma was of a generic nature . But for Dana the little girl was so uniquely formed , so particularly her infant self-the broad translucent toenails , the fully articulated lifeline in her palm , the feathery blue burst of iris , the kidney-shaped mole under her left ear-that though she and Graham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her baby to the flames . They buried her in a country graveyard near Somerset . <p> Dana had long ago given up both her father 's hope of paradise and her mother 's promise of reincarnation . The heaven she most admired was tempera on Renaissance ceiling plaster . Nothing in her experience suggested that the personality would cohere beyond the body . On the contrary , recycling seemed the fundamental principle : nothing blooms but through decay . She believed only and absolutely in immortality at the subatomic level , and considered the nitrogen cycle sufficient marvel , sufficient glory . <p> But that had not been put to the test , and now it was . Tentatively , and then fiercely , she embraced Chloe 's dispersal into the universe . She lay awake at night allowing herself to contemplate the little body in its batiste dress in its maple coffin , welcoming the insects and the ooze , not flinching from the translucent larvae , the self-generating maggots . She gathered this corruption in her arms and crooned to it . She held it to her heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then the still , ashen entropy of the beloved matter . Toenails , palms , iris , mole . Dust to dust . And then she slept . <p> Dust motes danced in the morning sun when she woke . <p> Night after night she did this . She did not speak of it . <p> Their friends were very kind , and appropriately promised healing and acceptance . But for Dana it was not the baby but her marriage that had died . Chloe rotting seemed supremely vital , whereas the inert weight of her days with Graham was revealed to her , the mechanical eroticism of their sex , the rote moral disconnect of their conversation , none of which could be raised again to semblance of a life . <p> So it is perhaps an enigma that , eight months later , as she was gathering herself to leave Graham and found that he was leaving her instead , she felt no hesitation in devoting herself wholly , for the first time , to her husband . He was her patient . She was patient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in postponement as in a cushioned space . She listened to his long denial and his scattershot anger and his surprisingly brief fears . When there was no further treatment , she brought him home , where he lay for two months on a rose- colored sofa decreasingly coherent and then decreasingly conscious while she patiently , arduously , unresentfully took care of him . <p> He had been apparently comatose for a week or so when she came in from an omelet supper in the kitchen , to find him , eyes closed , one index finger raised from the blanket . <p> Smiling , he said , " Mushrooms . " <p> And at this evidence of continuing appetite , the mystery of the persistence of the pleasure of the senses , for the first time she wept , and perhaps for the first time truly loved him . <p> How We Decide : <p> The quick decisions made by a quarterback on a football field provide a window into the inner workings of the brain . In the space of a few frenetic seconds , before a linebacker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a series of hard choices . The pocket is collapsing around him - the pocket begins to collapse before it exists - but he ca n't flinch or wince . His eyes must stay focused downfield , looking for some meaningful sign amid the action , an open man on a crowded field . Throwing the ball is the easy part . <p> These passing decisions happen so fast they do n't even seem like decisions . We are used to seeing football on television , captured by the cameras far above the grassy stage . From this distant perspective , the players appear to be moving in some sort of violent ballet ; the sport looks exquisitely choreographed . You can see the receivers spread the zone and watch the pocket slowly disintegrate . It 's easy to detect the weak spots of the defense and find the target with man-on-man coverage . You can tell which linebackers bought the play-action fake and see the cornerback racing in on the blitz . When you watch the game from this omniscient angle - coaches call it " the eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarterback is simply following orders , as if he knows where he is going to throw the ball before the play begins . <p> But this view of the game is deeply misleading . After the ball is snapped , the ordered sequence of neat X 's and O 's that fill the spiral-bound playbook degenerates into a street brawl . There 's a symphony of grunts and groans and the meaty echoes of fat men hitting hard ground . Receivers get pushed off their routes , passing angles get cut off , and inside blitzes derail the best intentions . The offensive line is an unpredictable wrestling match . Before the quarterback can make an effective decision , he needs to assimilate all of this new information and be aware of the approximate location of every player on the field . <p> The savage chaos of the game , the way every play is a mixture of careful planning and risky improvisation , is what makes the job of an NFL quarterback so difficult . Even while he 's immersed in the violence - the defensive line clawing at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He needs to look past the mayhem and make sense of all the moving bodies . Where is his receiver going ? Will the safety break toward the ball ? Is the linebacker going to drop back into coverage ? Did his tight end pick up the blitz ? Before a pass can be thrown - before the open man can be found - all of these questions need to be answered . Each pass is really a guess , a hypothesis launched into the air , but the best quarterbacks find ways to make better guesses . What separates Tom Brady and Joe Montana and Peyton Manning and John Elway and the other great quarterbacks of the modern NFL era from the rest is their ability to find the right receiver at the right time . ( The Patriots like to pass out of a five-wide formation , which means that Brady often checks off five different receivers before he decides where to throw the ball . ) No other team sport is so dependent on the judgment of a single player . <p> NFL scouts take the decision-making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every player in the draft take the Wonderlic intelligence test , which is essentially a shorter version of the standard IQ test . The test is twelve minutes long and consists of fifty questions that get progressively harder as the test goes along . Here 's an example of an easy Wonderlic question : <p> " Paper sells for 21 cents per pad . What will four pads cost ? " <p> And here 's a hard Wonderlic question : <p> " Three individuals form a partnership and agree to divide the profits equally . X invests $9,000 , Y invests $7,000 , Z invests $4,000 . If the profits are $4,800 , how much less does X receive than if the profits were divided in proportion to the amount invested ? " <p> The underlying thesis of the Wonderlic test is that players who are better at math and logic problems will make better decisions in the pocket . At first glance , this seems like a reasonable assumption . No other position in sports requires such extreme cognitive talents . Successful quarterbacks need to memorize hundreds of offensive plays @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spend hours studying game tape of their opponents and be able to put that knowledge to use on the field . In many instances , quarterbacks are even responsible for changing plays at the line of scrimmage . They are like coaches with shoulder pads . <p> As a result , an NFL team starts to get nervous when a quarterback 's score on the Wonderlic test is too far below the average for the position . For quarterbacks , the average is 25 . ( In comparison , the average score for computer programmers is 28 . Janitors , on average , score 15 , as do running backs . ) Vince Young , the star quarterback from the University of Texas , reportedly scored a 6 on the test , which led many teams to publicly question his ability to succeed in the NFL . <p> But Young ended up excelling in the pros . And he is n't the only quarterback who achieved success despite a poor Wonderlic score . Dan Marino scored 14 . Brett Favre 's Wonderlic score was 22 , and Randall Cunningham and Terry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been or will be inducted into the Hall of Fame . ( In recent years , Favre has surpassed many of the passing records once held by Marino , such as most passing yards and touchdowns in a career . ) Furthermore , several quarterbacks with unusually high Wonderlic scores - players like Alex Smith and Matt Leinart , who both scored above 35 on the test and were top-ten picks in the 2005 NFL draft - have struggled in the NFL , largely because they make poor decisions on the field . <p> The reason there is virtually no correlation between the results of the Wonderlic and the success of quarterbacks in the NFL is that finding the open man involves a very different set of decision-making skills than solving an algebra problem . While quarterbacks need to grapple with complexity - the typical offensive playbook is several inches thick - they do n't make sense of the football field the way they make sense of questions on a multiple-choice exam . The Wonderlic measures a specific kind of thought process , but the best quarterbacks do n't think in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that pass to Troy Brown . Brady 's decision depended on a long list of variables . He needed to know that the linebacker would n't fall back into coverage and that there were no cornerbacks in the area waiting for an interception . After that , he had to calculate the ideal place to hit Brown with the ball so that Brown would have plenty of room to run after the catch . Then he needed to figure out how to make a throw without hitting the defensive lineman blocking his passing lane . If Brady were forced to consciously analyze this decision - if he treated it like a question on the Wonderlic test - then every pass would require a lot of complicated trigonometry as he computed his passing angles on the plane of the football field . But how can you contemplate the math when five angry linemen are running straight at you ? The answer is simple : you ca n't . If a quarterback hesitates for even a split second , he is going to get sacked . <p> So how does a quarterback do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's like asking a baseball player why he decided to swing the bat at a particular pitch : the velocity of the game makes thought impossible . Brady can afford to give each receiver only a split second of attention before he has to move on to the next . As soon as he glances at a body in motion , he must immediately decide if that body will be open a few seconds in the future . As a result , a quarterback is forced to evaluate each of his passing alternatives without knowing how he 's evaluating them . Brady chooses a target without understanding why exactly he 's settled on that target . Did he pass to Troy Brown with twenty-nine seconds remaining in the Super Bowl because the middle linebacker had ceded too much space , or because the cornerbacks were following the other receivers downfield and leaving a small gap in the center of the field ? Or did Brady settle on Brown because all the other passing options were tightly covered , and he knew that he needed a long completion ? The quarterback ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind is making decisions without him . Even quarterbacks are mystified by their talents . " I do n't know how I know where to pass , " Brady says . " There are no firm rules . You just feel like you 're going to the right place .... And that 's where I throw it . " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
