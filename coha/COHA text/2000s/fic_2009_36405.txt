Julian Donahue 's generation were the pioneers of portable headphone music , and he began carrying with him everywhere the soundtrack to his days when he was fifteen . When he was twenty-three and new to the city , he roamed the Brooklyn Heights Promenade , claimed it as his discovery , colonized it with his hours and his Walkman . He fell in love with Manhattan 's skyline , like a first-time brothel guest falling for a seasoned professional . He mused over her reflections in the black East River at dusk , dawn , or darkest night , and each haloed light-in a tower or strung along the jeweled and sprawling spider legs of the Brooklyn Bridge 's spans-hinted at some meaning , which could be understood only when made audible by music and encoded in lyrics . Play on , Walkman , on , rewind and give me excess of it . <br> <br> Late in the evening of the day he completed his first job directing a television commercial , Julian sat in the fall air and listened to Dean Villerman on his Walkman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd just surfaced from a deep dive , and he had the sensation that he might never be so happy again as long as he lived . This quake of joy , inspiring and crippling , was longing , but longing for what ? True love ? A wife ? Wealth ? Music was not so specific as that . " Love " was in most of these potent songs , of course , but they-the music , the light , the season-implied more than this , because , treacherously , Julian was swelling only with longing for longing . He felt his nerves open and turn to the world like sunflowers on the beat , but this desire could not achieve release ; his body strained forward , but independent of any goal , though he did not know it for many years to come , until he proved it . <br> Because years later , when he had captured all that-love , wife , home , success , child-still he longed , just the same , when he listened to those same songs , now on a portable CD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( turning spindles wheezing as batteries failed ) . He felt it all again . He pressed Play and longed still . <br> When he was first married , Julian worried how he would feel about particular songs if his marriage should expire prematurely , in Rachel 's death or her infidelity ( yes , he had imagined it before he knew it , perhaps imagined it so vividly that he caused it ) . And he prepared himself to lose music for Rachel , as the price of love , the ticket torn at admission : he assumed that , whether the marriage worked or not , he would never really find his way back to the music , that old songs would be sucked dry of promise or too clogged with memory . <br> But no , music lasted longer than anything it inspired . After LPs , cassettes , and CDs , when matrimony was about to decay into its component elements-alimony and acrimony-the songs startled him and regained all their previous , pre-Rachel meanings , as if they had not only conjured her but then dismissed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He listened to the old songs again , years later on that same dark promenade , when every CD he had ever owned sat nestled in that greatest of all human inventions , the iPod , dialed up and yielding to his fingertip 's tap . The songs now offered him , in exchange for all he had lost , the sensation that there was something still to long for , still , something still approaching , and all that had gone before was merely prologue to an unimaginably profound love yet to seize him . If there was any difference now , it was only that his hunger for music had become more urgent , less a daily pleasure than a daily craving . <br> Julian Donahue married in optimistic confusion , separated in pessimistic confusion , and now was wandering toward a mistrustful divorcistan , a coolly celibate land . He understood little of what had transpired between the day he said he could not live without this woman and the day when the last of her belongings ( and many of his ) left their home . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguments , understand they were scaffolded by interlocking causes and built upon the unstable ruins of previous arguments . He saw that old arguments had been only partially dismantled either to mutual satisfaction or to no one 's , or to her satisfaction ( perhaps feigned ) and his relief , or to his satisfaction and her mounting resentment , to which he had been blind . Perhaps all of this swayed upon some swampland of preexisting incompatibility , despite mutual feelings of affection and lust all signatories probably felt back at the start . Obviously he would not downplay the role of Carlton , though it was wiser not to think about that , and he had become skilled at cutting off those fractal thoughts before they could blossom . <br> The day Rachel announced her indistractible thirst for his absence , Julian was consulting his music collection , hunting for the song that would explain to him , even obliquely , the bleak atmosphere in his home , the two magnetized black boxes circling each other , attracting and repelling each other from room to room . <br> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , kneeling in front of his CD shelves when Rachel entered behind him . " I was thinking about Carlton , and ... " <br> He must have been present for something . He recognized his dumb urge never to think about her again even as he failed to stop thinking about her , perhaps because of the energy required to stop those other thoughts . Photography still in his apartment claimed there had been Eiffel Tower kisses and golden beach sunsets ; he had n't thrown those out yet . He had drawn her portrait a hundred times and shot eight-millimeter video of her and sometimes still watched it when he was home alone and in the mood to mope . When there were animal shows on cable , he would put on the CD of Summer Holiday and mute the TV , switching back and forth with the remote , hitting Video Input over and over : Rachel sleeps on her side , her hair fanned out behind her and her arms pushing in front of her , as if she were soaring through the sky ; the polar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the ice to reach the seal ; Rachel bats a dream pest away from her face ; the seal is consumed in eight bites ; <br> " -I cover the waterfront ... " <br> Lately he watched the animals more and Rachel less and sometimes felt as if all human affairs-but especially his own-could be sufficiently explained by the wily , competing coyotes and babysitting , gnu-gnawing lionesses and fascistic ants . After he was separated from Rachel and returned to the wild , he watched animal channels for hours at a time because they helped him fall asleep . Later , when he was sandbagging the new structures of mind necessary to keep pain from splashing over all his daily activity , when he could consider those years and still go to work , the animals remained . When he was able to think about his past , to consider and not just feel his pain , to calculate how thoroughly Rachel had broken and discarded him , how comprehensively they had misimagined each other , the baboons and orcas offered a certain stabilizing hope for the years ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aggressive Teamsters on a commercial set were expressing threatened alpha status ; gallery openings served to tighten group bonds for the protection of like genes . One had to be less heartbroken , since our cousin primates died from emotional trauma or recovered from it quickly . Litters in the wild of almost every species included a certain number of unfeasible offspring , starved by the mother and siblings , or just eaten by them . <br> Urges that had once driven Julian-to pursue and capture shampoo models , for example-were explained and defused by animal shows . That old behavior was just what countless cheetahs did , spreading seed . More and more of life dripped down beneath him , reduced by the immutable laws and relaxed habits of the animal kingdom . Entire species went extinct ; ours would , too , someday , or evolve into something unrecognizable , a higher species that would pay no more attention to our obsessively cataloged feelings than we do to the despairs of Australopithecus , and all of this vain heartbreak that we cling to as important or tragic would one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behavior . <br> Continues ...
