Pharaoh of Upper Egypt <br> Thebes , 1283 bc <br> " Stay still , " Paser admonished firmly . Although Paser was my tutor and could n't tell a princess what to do , there would be extra lines to copy if I did n't obey . I stopped shifting in my beaded dress and stood obediently with the other children of Pharaoh Seti 's harem . But at thirteen years old , I was always impatient . Besides , all I could see was the gilded belt of the woman in front of me . Heavy sweat stained her white linen , trickling down her neck from beneath her wig . As soon as Ramesses passed in the royal procession , the court would be able to escape the heat and follow him into the cool shade of the temple . But the procession was moving terribly slow . I looked up at Paser , who was searching for an open path to the front of the crowd . <br> " Will Ramesses stop studying with us now that he 's to become coregent ? " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He took my arm and pushed our way through the sea of bodies . " Make way for the princess Nefertari ! Make way ! " Women with children stepped aside until we were standing at the very edge of the roadway . All along the Avenue of Sphinxes , tall pots of incense smoked and burned , filling the air with the sacred scent of kyphi that would make this , above all days , an auspicious one . The brassy sound of trumpets filled the avenue , and Paser pushed me forward . " The prince is coming ! " <br> " I see the prince every day , " I said sullenly . Ramesses was the only son of Pharaoh Seti , and now that he had turned seventeen , he would be leaving his childhood behind . There would be no more studying with him in the edduba , or hunting together in the afternoons . His coronation held no interest for me then , but when he came into view , even I caught my breath . From the wide lapis collar around his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was covered in jewels . His red hair shone like copper in the sun , and a heavy sword hung at his waist . Thousands of Egyptians surged forward to see , and as Ramesses strode past in the procession , I reached forward to tug at his hair . Although Paser inhaled sharply , Pharaoh Seti laughed , and the entire procession came to a halt . <br> " Little Nefertari . " Pharaoh patted my head . <br> " Little ? " I puffed out my chest . " I 'm not little . " I was thirteen , and in a month I 'd be fourteen . <br> Pharaoh Seti chuckled at my obstinacy . " Little only in stature then , " he promised . " And where is that determined nurse of yours ? " <br> " Merit ? In the palace , preparing for the feast . " <br> " Well , tell Merit I want to see her in the Great Hall tonight . We must teach her to smile as beautifully as you do . " He pinched my cheeks , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> " Stay close to me , " Paser ordered . <br> " Why ? You 've never minded where I 've gone before . " <br> We were swept into the temple with the rest of the court , and at last , the heavy heat of the day was shut out . In the dimly lit corridors a priest dressed in the long white robes of Amun guided us swiftly to the inner sanctum . I pressed my palm against the cool slabs of stone where images of the gods had been carved and painted . Their faces were frozen in expressions of joy , as if they were happy to see that we 'd come . <br> " Be careful of the paintings , " Paser warned sharply . <br> " Where are we going ? " <br> " To the inner sanctum . " <br> The passage widened into a vaulted chamber , and a murmur of surprise passed through the crowd . Granite columns soared up into the gloom , and the blue tiled roof had been inlaid with silver to imitate the night 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Amun priests were waiting , and I thought with sadness that once Ramesses was coregent , he would never be a carefree prince in the marshes again . But there were still the other children from the edduba , and I searched the crowded room for a friend . <br> " Asha ! " I beckoned , and when he saw me with our tutor , he threaded his way over . As usual , his black hair was bound tightly in a braid ; whenever we hunted it trailed behind him like a whip . Although his arrow was often the one that brought down the bull , he was never the first to approach the kill , prompting Pharaoh to call him Asha the Cautious . But as Asha was cautious , Ramesses was impulsive . In the hunt , he was always charging ahead , even on the most dangerous roads , and his own father called him Ramesses the Rash . Of course , this was a private joke between them , and no one but Pharaoh Seti ever called him that . I smiled a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not so welcoming . <br> " Why are n't you standing with the prince on the dais ? " <br> " But the ceremony wo n't begin until the call of the trumpets , " Asha explained . When Paser sighed , Asha turned to me . " What 's the matter ? Are n't you excited ? " <br> " How can I be excited , " I demanded , " when Ramesses will spend all his time in the Audience Chamber , and in less than a year you 'll be leaving for the army ? " <br> Asha shifted uncomfortably in his leather pectoral . " Actually , if I 'm to be a general , " he explained , " my training must begin this month . " The trumpets blared , and when I opened my mouth to protest , he turned . " It 's time ! " Then his long braid disappeared into the crowd . A great hush fell over the temple , and I looked up at Paser , who avoided my gaze . <br> " What is she doing here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the woman was speaking about me . " She 'll bring nothing but bad luck on this day . " <br> Paser looked down at me , and as the priests began their hymns to Amun , I pretended not to have heard the woman 's whispers . Instead , I watched as the High Priest Rahotep emerged from the shadows . A leopard 's pelt hung from his shoulders , and as he slowly ascended the dais , the children next to me averted their gaze . His face appeared frozen , like a mask that never stops grinning , and his left eye was still red as a carnelian stone . Heavy clouds of incense filled the inner sanctum , but Rahotep appeared immune to the smoke . He lifted the hedjet crown in his hands , and without blinking , placed it on top of Ramesses 's golden brow . " May the great god Amun embrace Ramesses the Second , for now he is Pharaoh of Upper Egypt . " <br> While the court erupted into wild cheers , I felt my heart sink . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's arms , and children with ivory clappers beat them together in a noise that filled the entire chamber . Seti , who was now only ruler of Lower Egypt , smiled widely . Then hundreds of courtiers began to move , crushing me between their belted waists . <br> " Come . We 're leaving for the palace ! " Paser shouted . <br> I glanced behind me . " What about Asha ? " <br> " He will have to find you later . " <br> Dignitaries from every kingdom in the world came to the palace of Malkata to celebrate Ramesses 's coronation . I stood at the entrance to the Great Hall , where the court took its dinner every night , and admired the glow of a thousand oil lamps as they cast their light across the polished tiles . The chamber was filled with men and women dressed in their finest kilts and beaded gowns . <br> " Have you ever seen so many people ? " <br> I turned . " Asha ! " I exclaimed . " Where have you been ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare  --  " <br> " For your time in the military ? " I crossed my arms , and when Asha saw that I was truly upset , he smiled disarmingly . <br> " But I 'm here with you now . " He took my arm and led me into the hall . " Have you seen the emissaries who have arrived ? I 'll bet you could speak with any one of them . " <br> " I ca n't speak Shasu , " I said , to be contrary . <br> " But every other language ! You could be a vizier if you were n't a girl . " He glanced across the hall and pointed . " Look ! " <br> I followed his gaze to Pharaoh Seti and Queen Tuya on the royal dais . The queen never went anywhere without Adjo , and the black-and-white dog rested his tapered head on her lap . Although her iwiw had been bred for hunting hare in the marshes , the farthest he ever walked was from his feathered cushion to his water bowl . Now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been placed next to his mother . <br> " So Ramesses will be seated off with his parents , " I said glumly . He had always eaten with me beneath the dais , at the long table filled with the most important members of the court . And now that his chair had been removed , I could see that my own had been placed next to Woserit , the High Priestess of Hathor . Asha saw this as well and shook his head . <br> " It 's too bad you ca n't sit with me . What will you ever talk about with Woserit ? " <br> " Nothing , I suspect . " <br> " At least they 've placed you across from Henuttawy . Do you think she might speak with you now ? " <br> All of Thebes was fascinated with Henuttawy , not because she was one of Pharaoh Seti 's two younger sisters , but because there was no one in Egypt with such mesmerizing beauty . Her lips were carefully painted to match the red robes of the goddess Isis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vivid color . As a child of seven I had been fascinated by the way her cloak swirled around her sandals , like water moving gently across the prow of a ship . I had thought at the time that she was the most beautiful woman I would ever see , and tonight I could see that I was still correct . Yet even though we had eaten together at the same table for as long as I could remember , I could n't recall a single instance when she had spoken to me . I sighed . " I doubt it . " <br> " Do n't worry , Nefer . " Asha patted my shoulder the way an older brother might have . " I 'm sure you 'll make friends . " <br> He crossed the hall , and I watched him greet his father at the generals ' table . Soon , I thought , he 'll be one of those men , wearing his braided hair in a small loop at the back of his neck , never going anywhere without his sword . When Asha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mother , Queen Mutnodjmet . If she had survived , this would have been her court , filled with her friends , and viziers , and laughter . Women would never dare to whisper about me , for instead of being a spare princess , I 'd be the princess . <br> I took my place next to Woserit , and a prince from Hatti smiled across at me . The three long braids that only Hittites wore fell down his back , and as the guest of honor , his chair had been placed to the right of Henuttawy . Yet no one had remembered the Hittite custom of offering bread to the most important guest first . I took the untouched bowl and passed it to him . <br> He was about to thank me when Henuttawy placed her slender hand on his arm and announced , " The court of Egypt is honored to host the prince of Hatti as a guest at my nephew 's coronation . " <br> The viziers , along with everyone at the table , raised their cups , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . But what the prince said had n't been funny . His eyes searched the table for help , and when no one came to his aid , he looked at me . <br> " He is saying that although this is a happy day , " I translated , " he hopes that Pharaoh Seti will live for many years and not leave the throne of Lower Egypt to Ramesses too soon . " <br> Henuttawy paled , and at once I saw that I was wrong to have spoken . <br> " Intelligent girl , " the prince said in broken Egyptian . <br> But Henuttawy narrowed her eyes . " Intelligent ? Even a parrot can learn to imitate . " <br> " Come , Priestess . Nefertari is quite clever , " Vizier Anemro offered . " No one else remembered to pass bread to the prince when he came to the table . " <br> " Of course she remembered , " Henuttawy said sharply . " She proba- bly learned it from her aunt . If I recall , the Heretic Queen liked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought us the plague . I 'm surprised our brother even allows her to sit among us . " <br> Woserit frowned . " That was a long time ago . Nefertari ca n't help who her aunt was . " She turned to me . " It 's not important , " she said kindly . <br> " Really ? " Henuttawy gloated . " Then why else would Ramesses consider marrying Iset and not our princess ? " I lowered my cup , and Henuttawy continued . " Of course , I have no idea what Nefertari will do if she 's not to become a wife of Ramesses . Maybe you could take her in , Woserit . " Henuttawy looked to her younger sister , the High Priestess of the cow goddess Hathor . " I hear that your temple needs some good heifers . " <br> A few of the courtiers at our table snickered , and Henuttawy looked at me the way a snake looks at its dinner . <br> Woserit cleared her throat . " I do n't know why our brother puts up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Hittite prince , and both of them stood to join the dancing . When the music began , Woserit leaned close to me . " You must be careful around my sister now . Henuttawy has many powerful friends in the palace , and she can ruin you in Thebes if that 's what she wishes . " <br> " Because I translated for the prince ? " <br> " Because Henuttawy has an interest in seeing Iset become Chief Wife , and there has been talk that this was a role Ramesses might ask you to fill . Given your past , I should say it 's unlikely , but my sister would still be more than happy to see you disappear . If you want to continue to survive in this palace , Nefertari , I suggest you think where your place in it will be . Ramesses 's childhood ended tonight , and your friend Asha will enter the military soon . What will you do ? You were born a princess and your mother was a queen . But when your mother died , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one to guide you , and that 's why you 're allowed to run around wild , hunting with the boys and tugging Ramesses 's hair . " <br> I flushed . I had thought Woserit was on my side . <br> " Oh , Pharaoh Seti thinks it is cute , " she admitted . " And you are . But in two years that kind of behavior wo n't be so charming . And what will you do when you 're twenty ? Or thirty even ? When the gold that you 've inherited is spent , who will support you ? Has n't Paser ever spoken about this ? " <br> I steadied my lip with my teeth . " No . " <br> Woserit raised her brows . " None of your tutors ? " <br> I shook my head . <br> " Then you still have much to learn , no matter how fluent your Hittite . " <br> That evening , as I undressed for bed , my nurse remarked on my unusual silence . <br> " What ? Not practicing languages , my lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bowl , then set out a cloth so I could wash my face . <br> " What is the point of practicing ? " I asked . " When will I use them ? Viziers learn languages not spare princesses . And since a girl ca n't be a vizier . . . " <br> Merit scraped a stool across the tiles and sat next to me . She studied my face in the polished bronze , and no nurse could have been more different from her charge . Her bones were large , whereas mine were small , and Ramesses liked to say that whenever she was angry her neck swelled beneath her chin like a fat pelican 's pouch . She carried her weight in her hips and her breasts , whereas I had no hips and breasts at all . She had been my nurse from the time my mother had died in childbirth , and I loved her as if she were my own mawat . Now , her gaze softened as she guessed at my troubles . " Ah . " She sighed deeply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <br> I glanced at her in the mirror . " Then it 's true ? " <br> She shrugged . " There 's been some talk in the palace . " As she shifted her ample bottom on the stool , faience anklets jangled on her feet . " Of course , I had hopes that he was going to marry you . " <br> " Me ? " I thought of Woserit 's words and stared at her . " But why ? " <br> She took back my cloth and wrung it out in the bowl . " Because you are the daughter of a queen , no matter your relationship to the Heretic and his wife . " She was referring to Nefertiti and her husband , Akhenaten , who had banished Egypt 's gods and angered Amun . Their names were never spoken in Thebes . They were simply The Heretics , and even before I had understood what this meant , I had known that it was bad . Now , I tried to imagine Ramesses looking at me with his wide blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warm flush crept over my body . Merit continued , " Your mother would have expected to see you married to a king . " <br> " And if I do n't marry ? " After all , what if Ramesses did n't feel the same way about me as I felt about him ? <br> " Then you will become a priestess . But you go every day to the Temple of Amun , and you 've seen how the priestesses live , " she said warningly , motioning for me to stand with her . " There would n't be any fine horses or chariots . " <br> I raised my arms , and Merit took off my beaded dress . " Even if I were a High Priestess ? " <br> Merit laughed . " Are you already planning for Henuttawy 's death ? " <br> I flushed . " Of course not . " <br> " Well , you are thirteen . Nearly fourteen . It 's time to decide your place in this palace . " <br> " Why does everyone keep telling me this tonight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . " <br> I put on a fresh sheath , and when I climbed into bed , Merit looked down at me . <br> " You have eyes like Tefer , " she said tenderly . " They practically glow in the lamplight . " My spotted miw curled closer to me , and when Merit saw us together she smiled . " A pair of green-eyed beauties , " she said . <br> " Not as beautiful as Iset . " <br> Merit sat herself on the edge of my bed . " You are the equal of any girl in this palace . " <br> I rolled my eyes and turned my face away . " You do n't have to pretend . I know I 'm nothing like Iset  --  " <br> " Iset is three years older than you . In a year or two , you will be a woman and will have grown into your body . " <br> " Asha says I 'll never grow , that I 'll still be as short as Seti 's dwarfs when I 'm twenty . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pouch wagged angrily . " And what does Asha think he knows about dwarfs ? You will be as tall and beautiful as Isis one day ! And if not as tall , " she added cautiously , " then at least as beautiful . What other girl in this palace has eyes like yours ? They 're as pretty as your mother 's . And you have your aunt 's smile . " <br> " I 'm nothing like my aunt , " I said angrily . <br> But then , Merit had been raised in the court of Nefertiti and Akhenaten , so she would know if this were true . Her father had been an important vizier , and Merit had been a nurse to Nefertiti 's children . In the terrible plague that swept through Amarna , Merit lost her family and two of Nefertiti 's daughters in her care . But she never spoke about it to me , and I knew she wished to forget this time twenty years ago . I was sure , as well , that Paser had taught us that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I was too afraid to confirm this with Merit . This is what my past was like for me . Narrowed eyes , whispering , and uncertainty . I shook my head and murmured , " I am nothing like my aunt . " <br> Merit raised her brows . " She may have been a heretic , " she whispered , " but she was the greatest beauty who ever walked in Egypt . " <br> " Prettier than Henuttawy ? " I challenged . <br> " Henuttawy would have been cheap bronze to your aunt 's gold . " <br> I tried to imagine a face prettier than Henuttawy 's , but could n't do it . Secretly I wished that there was an image of Nefertiti left in Thebes . " Do you think that Ramesses will choose Iset because I am related to the Heretic Queen ? " <br> Merit pulled the covers over my chest , prompting a cry of protest from Tefer . " I think that Ramesses will choose Iset because you are thirteen and he is seventeen . But soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for whatever future you decide . " <br> Continues ...
