NORTHWEST PORTLAND December 13 <p> Come on , Jalapeo ! " <p> Katie Converse jerked the dog 's leash . Reluctantly , the black Lab mix lifted his nose and followed her . Katie wanted to hurry , but everything seemed to invite Jalapeo to stop , sniff , and lift his leg . And there was no time for that now . Not today . <p> She had grown up less than two miles from here , but this afternoon everything looked different . It was winter , for one thing , nearly Christmas . And she was n't the same person she had been the last time she was here , not a month earlier . Then she had been a little girl playing at being a grown-up . Now she was a woman . <p> Finally , she reached the agreed-upon spot . She was still shaking from what she had said less than two hours earlier . What she had demanded . <p> Now there was nothing to do but wait . Not an easy task for an impatient seventeen-year-old . <p> She heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grin , Katie called his name as she turned around . <p> At the sight of the face , contorted with rage , Jalapeo growled . <p> MARK O. HATFIELD UNITED STATES COURTHOUSE December 14 <p> As she walked to the courtroom podium , federal prosecutor Allison Pierce touched the tiny silver cross she wore on a fine chain . The cross was hidden under her cream-colored silk blouse , but it was always there , close to Allison 's heart . Her father had given it to her for her sixteenth birthday . <p> Allison was dressed in what she thought of as her " court uniform , " a navy blue suit with a skirt that , even on her long legs , hit below the knee . This morning she had tamed her curly brown hair into a low bun and put on small silver hoops . She was thirty-three , but in court she wanted to make sure no one thought of her as young or unseasoned . <p> She took a deep breath and looked up at Judge Fitzpatrick . " Your Honor , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coldly , calculatedly , and callously plotted his wife 's murder . If Mr. Archer had been dealing with a real hired killer instead of an FBI agent , Toni Archer would be dead today . Instead , she is in hiding and in fear for her life . " <p> A year earlier Frank Archer had had what he told friends was a five-foot-four problem . Toni . She wanted a divorce . Archer was an engineer , and he was good at math . A divorce meant splitting all their worldly goods and paying for child support . But if Toni were to die ? Then not only would Archer avoid a divorce settlement , but he would benefit from Toni 's $300,000 life insurance policy . <p> Archer asked an old friend from high school-who also happened to be an ex-con-if he knew anyone who could help . The old friend found Rod Emerick , but Rod was n't a hired killer-he was an FBI agent . Archer agreed to meet Rod in a hotel room , which the FBI bugged . In a windowless van parked outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and snow , waiting until they had enough to make an arrest before she gave the order . With gritted teeth , she had watched Archer hand over a snapshot of Toni , her license number , her work schedule , and $5,000 in fifties and hundreds . She sometimes understood those who killed from passion-but killers motivated by greed left her cold . <p> Given the strength of the evidence , Archer had had no choice but to plead guilty . Now , as Allison advocated for the maximum possible sentence , she did n't look over at him once . He was a small man , with thinning blonde hair and glasses . He looked nothing like a killer . But after five years as a federal prosecutor , Allison had learned that few killers did . <p> After she finished , she rejoined Rod at the prosecutor 's table and listened to the defense attorney 's sad litany of excuses . Archer had n't known what he was doing , he was distraught , he was under a lot of stress , he was n't sleeping well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everyone in the crowded courtroom could see through . <p> " Do you have anything you would like to say to the court before sentencing ? " Judge Fitzpatrick asked Archer . <p> Archer got to his feet , eyes brimming with crocodile tears . " I 'm very , very sorry . Words can not describe how I feel . It was all a huge mistake . I love Toni very much . " <p> Allison did n't realize she was shaking her head until she felt Rod 's size 12 loafer squishing the toe of her sensible navy blue pump . <p> They all rose for the sentence . <p> " Frank Archer , you have pled guilty to the cowardly and despicable act of plotting to have your spouse murdered . " Judge Fitzpatrick 's face was like a stone . " Today 's sentence should send a strong message to cowards who think they can hide by hiring a stranger to commit an act of violence . I hereby sentence you to ten years for attempted capital murder-for-hire , to be followed by two years of supervised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had an excellent track record , but the previous case she had prosecuted had shaken her confidence . The date rapist had been pronounced innocent , which had left his victim stunned , fearful , and angry-and left Allison feeling guilty that she had n't been able to put him away for years . Today , at least , she had made the world a safer place . <p> A second later , her mood was shattered . <p> " It 's all your fault ! " Archer shouted . He was n't yelling at Toni-his ex-wife was too afraid to be in the courtroom . Instead , he was pointing at Allison and Rod . " You set me up ! " <p> Archer was dragged from the courtroom , and Rod patted Allison 's arm . " Do n't worry , " he said . " We 'll keep an eye on him . " <p> She nodded and managed a smile . Still , she felt a pulse of fear . Ten years from now , would the man come back to take his revenge ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the courthouse-known to Portlanders as the " Schick Razor Building " because of its curved , overhanging roof-while she called Toni with the good news . In the parking lot , she pressed the fob on her key chain , unlocked her car door , and slid behind the wheel , still talking . <p> Only after she had accepted Toni 's thanks and said good-bye did she see the folded paper underneath her windshield wiper . Muttering under her breath about junk advertising , she got back out of the car and tugged the paper free . <p> Then she unfolded it . <p> The professional part of Allison immediately began to take notes . For one thing , except in a movie , she had never actually seen a threat written in letters cut from a magazine . For another , were her own fingerprints obscuring those of the person who had done this ? <p> But the human side of Allison could n't help trembling . For all her detachment , she could n't tamp down her horror as she read the message . <p> I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to like it . And then I 'm going to cut you into little pieces . And I 'm going to like it . <p> MYSPACE.COM/THEDCPAGE Better Not Let Me Talk to Boys September 5 <p> Hi ! I 'm a Senate page on Capitol Hill . This blog will tell about my experiences here in Pageland . <p> Washington DC is all tall buildings , honking cabs &amp; humidity that feels like someone wrapped you up in a blanket of steam . Plus it smells funky . Like hot garbage . <p> It turns out that the Vietnam Memorial &amp; the Washington Monument &amp; the statue of Lincoln are all a couple of blocks apart . My stepmom V has been trying to get me to all the famous sites , even though there will be trips every other weekend just for the pages . ( Now she 's asleep &amp; I 'm writing this in the bathroom of the hotel , which has free wireless . ) <p> I ca n't believe that the whole time we 've been here it 's been raining . For some reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some guy on the street was selling umbrellas . <p> After all the sightseeing , we went out to dinner with Senator X. He got me this internship , but I probably wo n't see him very much . I 'll be working for all the senators , especially the 50 Republicans , not just him . ( Working in the Senate is better than working in the House . I hear they have to stare at hundreds of photos so they can memorize all the faces &amp; names in their party . Compared to that , 50 is a piece of cake . ) <p> We ate at an elegant Japanese restaurant , where I had many things that I ca n't pronounce . Not only are the Japanese people good at anime , but they know how to cook . <p> Before our food came , V told these people at the next table to keep their toddler under control . He had a cup of Cheerios &amp; was throwing some on the floor . So of course she had to boss them around . Then V started telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me &amp; not let me talk to boys . I just wanted to crawl under the table , even though they both pretended she was joking . <p> Does n't she realize that I 'm not a little kid anymore ? In eight days , I 'm going to be seventeen ! <p> PIERCE RESIDENCE December 14 <p> Allison set the pregnancy test on the edge of the tub . Marshall was in the living room , stretching in front of the TV news , getting ready to go for a run . <p> All afternoon , this moment had been in the back of her mind , providing a welcome distraction from her anxiety whenever she thought about the threatening note . Rod had come as soon as she called and had taken the document away as evidence . He asked her if she had any enemies , but they both knew the question was a joke . <p> Of course Allison had made enemies , most recently Archer . She was a third-generation prosecutor , so she knew it came with the territory . <p> The so-called blue-collar criminals-bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For them , getting caught and doing time was an accepted risk , a cost of doing business . They were professionals , like she was . In a weird way , they understood that Allison was just doing her job . <p> It was the other ones , the ones who had been fairly upstanding citizens until they snapped at dinner and stabbed their spouse or decided that bank robbery was a perfect way to balance the family budget . Those were the ones you needed to watch out for . Their feelings for Allison were personal . Personal-and dangerous . For now , she would be extra careful , and Rod had alerted the Portland police to make additional patrols past her house . <p> Her watch said 6:21 . She told herself that she would n't pick up the white stick again until 6:30 . The test only took three minutes , but she wanted to be sure . How many times had she watched one of these stupid tests , willing two crossed lines to show up in the results window but seeing only one ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , honey , " Marshall called from the living room . She heard the sound of the front door closing . <p> Allison had n't told him she was going to take the test today . She was four days late , but she had been four days late before . After so many failed tests , so many months in which being even a day late had filled her with feverish speculation , Marshall no longer inquired too closely into the details . <p> When they started this journey two years ago , she had been sure that she and Marshall would conceive easily . Any teenager could have a baby . How hard could it be ? She and Marshall had always been scrupulous about birth control . Now it seemed like a bitter joke . She had wasted hundreds of dollars preventing something that would never have happened anyway . <p> They had started trying a month after her thirty-first birthday , giddy to be " playing without a net . " At the end of the first month , Allison was sure she was pregnant : her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she often felt dizzy when she stood up . But then her period arrived on schedule . <p> As the months passed she got more serious , tracked her temperature , made charts . Even though she had read all the statistics about how fertility declined with every passing year , it had n't seemed like they applied to her . <p> How many crime victims had she met who had never believed that anything bad could happen to them ? Because they were special ? <p> " It 's in your hands , Lord , " she murmured . The idea was one she struggled with every day , at home and at work . How much was she responsible for ? How much was out of her control ? She had never been good at letting go . <p> To distract herself , Allison turned on the small TV they kept in the bedroom on top of an oak highboy . After a Subaru commercial , the Channel Four news anchor said , " And now we have a special bulletin from our crime reporter , Cassidy Shaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of a beautiful white Victorian house . She wore a coral suit that set off her blonde shoulder-length hair . Her blue eyes looked startlingly topaz-either she was wearing colored contacts or the TV set needed to be adjusted . <p> " A family is asking for your help in finding a teenager who has been missing from Northwest Portland since yesterday afternoon , " Cassidy said , wearing the expression reporters reserved for serious events . " Seventeen-year-old Katie Converse left her parents a note saying she was taking the family dog for a walk-and she has not been seen since . Here 's a recent photo of Katie , who is on winter break from the United States Senate 's page program . " <p> The camera cut to a photograph of a pretty blonde girl with a snub nose and a dusting of freckles . Allison caught her breath . Even though Katie was blonde and Lindsay had dark hair , it was almost like looking at her sister when she was Katie 's age . The nose was the same , the shape of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , back when she was young and innocent and full of life . <p> Cassidy continued , " Katie is five feet , two inches tall and weighs 105 pounds . She has blue eyes , blonde hair , and freckles . She was last seen wearing a black sweater , blue jeans , a navy blue Columbia parka , and Nike tennis shoes . The dog , named Jalapeo , is a black Lab mix . <p> " Authorities are investigating . The family asks that if you have seen Katie , to please call the number on your screen . This is Cassidy Shaw , reporting from Northwest Portland . " <p> Allison said a quick prayer that the girl would be safe . But a young woman like that would have no reason to run away , not if she was already living away from home . Nor was she likely to be out partying . Allison knew a little bit about the page program . It was fiercely competitive , attracting smart , serious , college-bound students whose idea of fun was the mock state legislature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Cassidy were in high school . <p> She looked at her watch and was surprised to see it was already 6:29 . She made herself wait until the clock clicked over to 6:30 , then reached for the pregnancy test . The first time she had bought only one , sure that was all she would need . Now , two years later , she bought them in multipacks at Costco . <p> In the control window was a pink horizontal line . And in the other window , the results window , were pink crosshairs . <p> Not single pink lines in both windows . <p> She was pregnant . <p> PORTLAND FBI HEADQUARTERS December 15 <p> The words popped up on FBI special agent Nicole Hedges 's screen . <p> PDXer : Whats ur favorite subject ? <p> Nic-using the screen name BubbleBeth-and some guy going by the name PDXer were in a private area of a chat room called Younger Girls/Older Men . <p> BubbleBeth : Lunch <p> It was what Nic always answered . She could disconnect from her fingers , from the reality behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Which was good . Because if she thought about it too much , she would go crazy . <p> At first , working for Innocent Images , the FBI 's cyber-crime squad 's effort to take down online predators , had seemed like a perfect fit . Regular hours , which were kind of a must when you were a single parent . The downside was that she spent all day exposed to vile men eager to have sex with a girl who barely qualified as a teen . <p> Most people were surprised that it was n't the creepy guy in the raincoat who went online trolling for young girls . If only . In real life it was the teacher , the doctor , the grandpa , the restaurant manager . The average offender was a professional white male aged twenty-five to forty-five . <p> PDXer : How old R U ? <p> BubbleBeth : 13 <p> In Oregon , eighteen was the age of consent . But prosecutors preferred to keep it clear-cut to make it easier for the jury to convict . So Nic told the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never older . Some typed L8R-later-as soon as Nic told them her imaginary age . For the rest , it was like throwing a piece of raw meat into a dog kennel . <p> PDXer : Kewl <p> Surveys had shown that one in seven kids had received an online sexual solicitation in the past year . It was Nic 's job to find the places where the chances were n't one in seven , but 100 percent , which meant going to chat rooms . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
