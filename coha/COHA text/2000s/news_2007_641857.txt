<p> kansas city , kan . Sunday 's Nextel Cup race , pegged for 267 laps at Kansas Speedway , was downsized twice and still required more than six hours to find a winner . <p> But you had to look hard for Greg Biffle , who celebrated his controversial victory in near darkness and in front of half of the 110,000 fans that stayed to see the unsightly end . <p> For drivers , crews , fans and everyone else , it was triple overtime at the rain-soaked and wind-blown 1.5-mile oval . The sun settled long before the scheduled completion of the race was in sight , and when it finally ended under caution at lap 210 , seven of the 12 Chase playoff drivers were eliminated or were limping around with damaged cars . <p> Biffle , not among those in the playoff field , used patience to win his first race of the season in the third of 10 playoff events . He only led once but stayed in front for the final 36 laps . <p> Because of darkness and lack of lighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Montoya crashed on lap 208 . <p> " It was so dark , three laps before the caution I opened my visor , " said Biffle , who appeared to run out of gas on the final lap . " It was so dark . This was a wild day . " <p> It was undoubtedly the most unconventional race in four years of NASCAR playoffs . <p> The race was red-flagged for nearly three hours because of two rain delays , and shortened from 225 to 210 laps after a handful of crashes developed after the second red flag . <p> Chase drivers Clint Bowyer and Jimmie Johnson were second and third , respectively , and fellow playoff participants Jeff Gordon ( fifth ) , Kevin Harvick ( sixth ) and Kurt Busch ( 11th ) also fared well . <p> The other six Chase drivers finished outside the top 28 , including Kyle Busch ( 41st ) , Tony Stewart ( 39th ) , Martin Truex Jr . ( 38th ) , Carl Edwards ( 37th ) and Denny Hamlin ( 29th ) , who each crashed out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who is second , six points behind . Bowyer climbed to third , and Stewart fell from second to fourth , from two to 117 points back . <p> The final lap will be talked about all week . Biffle was n't the first driver to take the checkered flag . He slowed on the last lap , was passed by a handful of drivers , and appeared to run out of gas after crossing the finish line . His car was pushed to Victory Lane . <p> If Biffle was unable to keep up adequate speed under caution , Johnson and Gordon said the passes should count . NASCAR rules require drivers to keep up with the pace car under caution . <p> " The car still runs , " Biffle said . " It still has gas in it . " <p> He said NASCAR officials told him they would push the car to Victory Lane , perhaps to expedite postrace ceremonies . <p> But , Gordon said : " You have to maintain a reasonable pace . Everybody was slowing down trying to figure out what he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pace and the pace car was driving away , so we all just started going by him . In my opinion , he did n't win that race . Clint Bowyer won the race . " <p> Early on , Dale Earnhardt Jr . bumped Kyle Busch from behind and sent him spinning into the wall , severely damaging Busch 's championship hopes . The irony is that Earnhardt will drive for Busch 's team next season . <p> " I want to apologize to his fans and their team and Kyle , " Earnhardt said . " I just ran into the back of him . I was screaming as I was going by for him to save it , but he could n't gather it up .
