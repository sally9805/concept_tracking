Section : POLITICS <p> DEMOCRATS TOOK THEIR LOSS in the November elections hard . " I 've been in this town now for 35 years , " said Al Hunt on CNN 's Capital Gang the Saturday after the election . " I 've never seen Democrats as down as I 've seen them the last three or four days . There is no question of that . They really are depressed , not just because it was a bit of a surprise that they lost as convincingly as they did , but as I said earlier , as they look ahead , they do n't see anything that 's particularly good on the horizon . " <p> But many Democrats did n't stay down for long . Within a couple of days of Mr. Hunt 's assessment , their surprise had been converted into speculation that the election had been stolen from John Kerry . The fever swamps of post-election conspiracy theories were bubbling . There were dark tales by Internet bloggers of curious voting patterns in Florida counties , Ohio precincts with more votes cast than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " computer programmers who could have hacked into electronic voting machines and altered the results . <p> The Internet conspiracy theories made some modest progress in spinning their yarns despite being largely ignored by major media outlets . They persuaded Green Party candidate David Cobb and Libertarian candidate Michael Badnarik to demand a recount of the votes in Ohio . The bloggers immediately began trying to raise $110,000 to cover the costs of recounting all of Ohio 's approximately 9,000 precincts . In a separate move , Ralph Nader asked for a recount in New Hampshire , claiming that John Kerry had conceded too quickly and reneged on his promise that all votes would be counted . <p> Democratic consultant Joe Trippi , who served as Howard Dean 's 2004 campaign manager , says the Kerry campaign came under intense post-election pressure from major donors not to ignore the Internet conspiracy theorists . " If they dismissed them , they risked seeing them walk away from future giving to the Democratic Party , " Trippi told me . <p> That helps explain why on November 11 the Kerry campaign belatedly agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " to gather data from election boards about uncounted ballots and other unresolved issues . But Kerry advisers cautioned that they did n't expect to find anything dramatic . " No one would be more interested than me in finding out that we really won , but that ai n't the case , " Jack Corrigan , the lawyer who led Kerry 's army of Election Day attorneys , told the Boston Globe . " Unlike 2000 , there is no doubt that they actually got more votes than we did , and they got them in the states that mattered . " <p> BUT SUCH STATEMENTS FROM DEMOCRATS in a position to know did nothing to dissuade some people you 'd expect to be semi-serious . Jeff Fisher , the Democratic candidate for the U.S. House from Florida 's Palm Beach County , told liberal radio talk show host Thom Hartmann on the Saturday after the election that he had called the FBI and was waiting for them to show up . Fisher claimed to have evidence not only that the Florida election was hacked , but of who hacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " these same people had previously hacked the Democratic primary race in 2002 so that Jeb Bush would not have to run against Janet Reno , who presented a real threat to Jeb , but instead against Bill McBride , a candidate who Jeb beat . " <p> " It was practice for a national effort , " Fisher told Hartmann . Fisher is just sane enough not to suspect skullduggery in his own race , which he lost 68 to 32 percent to GOP incumbent Mark Foley . <p> Jeff Fisher is only one of many liberal activists who wo n't accept the fact that George W. Bush won with a 3.5 million margin and 286 electoral votes , 16 more than needed . MoveOn.org , the 2.3 million member liberal group bankrolled by financier George Soros , is asking for signatures and donations to initiate an " Investigate the Vote " campaign to learn if voters " were wrongly prevented " from casting ballots and if legitimate votes were " miscounted or not counted at all . " Other groups , such as stolenelection2004.com , have formed efforts on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harris , claims to have documents proving fraud in the November balloting . <p> All of these groups tend to recycle the same complaints . At the top of the list are suspicions about electronic " black box " voting machines : <p> A voting machine in Franklin County , Ohio , gave Bush more than 4,000 votes when only 638 votes were cast . The error was corrected after a reporter for the Columbus Dispatch called the county board of elections . <p> In North Carolina , an estimated 4,500 votes were lost because computer voting machines were allowed to exceed the capacity of their memory . <p> A still-unknown number of voters around the country have complained about problems with touch-screen machines that appeared to record a different candidate from the one they chose . <p> It 's true some states have moved too quickly using new federal money to buy Direct Recording Electronic voting machines ( DREs ) , which work like an ATM . Several states have reported software failures , and California officials have accused Diebold , the company that manufactures DREs , of using uncertified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DREs will only fuel a litigation mindset that could see the controversy about some future election make Florida 's 2000 fiasco look like a moot court . <p> Joe Andrew , chairman of the Democratic National Committee until 2001 , is a senior adviser to a biotech firm that owned several Internet companies . He says the conspiracy theories are n't healthy and last June he told the Maryland Association of Election Officials that " when it comes to electronic voting , most liberals are just plain old-fashioned nuts . " While conservatives were skilled at coordinating their messages , he added , " that does not mean there is a vast right-wing conspiracy trying to steal votes in America , as the loudest voices on the left are saying today . " <p> Mr. Andrew said the people obsessed about DRE manipulation are either computer experts with impressive technical knowledge but little practical experience with elections or left-leaning computer users who are conspiratorial by nature . He noted with regret that they have been joined in their hysteria by prominent Democrats who " are rallying behind the anti-DRE bandwagon in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is good for Democrats . " <p> They 're wrong . The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has generally supported electronic voting because the voters who are most likely to be helped by DREs are ( a ) the disabled ( they can vote without assistance ) ; ( b ) the less educated ( they 're comforted by the machines ' similarity to the ATM ) ; ( c ) the elderly ( you can increase the type size ) ; and ( d ) citizens with limited English skills ( the machines are multilingual ) . <p> Indeed , whatever problems DREs have must be compared to other existing systems . In last year 's California recall election , punch-card systems did n't register a valid vote on 6.3 percent of all ballots cast . For optical scan systems , the under-vote rate was 2.7 percent and for DREs it was only 1.5 percent . As for the theories that DREs could be programmed to change an election outcome , Mr. Andrew dismissed them by saying " the liberal Internet activists are bonkers . " John Lott , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said that some of the obsession about DREs " sounds a lot like an effort to anger some people into voting while providing the basis for lots of election litigation if the results are close . " <p> ADDING TO THE SPECULATION are early exit polls that showed Kerry leading in states where he ultimately lost . While news organizations have discounted the polls as inaccurate , some with voting fraud suspicions contend it was the ballot counts that were off . Internet activist Juliet Stewart of Cincinnati says flatly , " We believe that John Kerry legally won Ohio . " But she admits that never-say-die Kerry supporters have been unable to persuade anyone in the Kerry camp to embrace their claims . <p> One of the main pieces of evidence cited by Ms. Stewart and other Internet bloggers is that in about two dozen Florida counties , President Bush received far more votes than the number of registered Republicans . In Lafayette County , for example , Bush won 74 percent of the vote even though 83 percent of residents are registered as Democrats . But Lafayette County Supervisor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Bible Belt and routinely votes for Republicans . Bob Dole carried the county in 1996 even as he lost Florida to Bill Clinton . <p> Another theory , propounded by blogger Colin Shea , was that a number of precincts in Ohio 's Cuyahoga County ( which includes Cleveland ) had voter turnout well above the national average , indeed well over 100 percent of registered voters in some cases . A total of 93,000 extra votes appeared to have been inexplicably cast on November 2 . " It 's the ballot-box equivalent of Jesus ' miracle of the fishes . Bush being such a man of God , perhaps we should not be surprised . " <p> The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review took about five minutes to shoot down this fevered speculation . Reporter Bill Steigerwald noted that he used " a high-tech personal communication device professional journalists refer to as a ' telephone . ' " He called the Cuyahoga County election office , which is run by Democrats . It turns out the votes were " a computer anomaly " that did n't affect or reflect the official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 18,472 votes had been counted in Fairview Park , a Cleveland suburb that had only 13,342 registered voters ? Absentee ballots from many precincts had been grouped together by the computer and credited to Fairview Park , where 8,421 voted . <p> BUT NO AMOUNT OF DEBUNKING will wipe away all doubts about the 2004 election . In the 1960s , historian Richard Hofstadter wrote a classic essay called " The Paranoid Style in American Politics , " in which he talked about the American tradition of hatching conspiracy theories . Examples abound in modern politics , from the McCarthyism of the 1950s up to Hillary Clinton inventing a " vast , right-wing conspiracy " during her husband 's impeachment travails . <p> This year , the paranoid style is asserting itself with claims that John Kerry simply could n't have lost to someone as clueless , evil , or unpopular as George W. Bush . The danger is that the conspiracy theories will prompt people to ignore legitimate complaints about outdated technology , voter fraud , poor voter education , and poorly written and contradictory election rules . Everyone should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hell . " If the margin in Ohio had been 36,000 votes rather than 136,000 , we would have seen another post-election meltdown , " says Dan Tokaji , a law professor at the Ohio State University . <p> In an election in a country with 186,000 precincts and over 120 million votes cast , a certain number of irregularities are to be expected . That does n't mean we should tolerate them . Indeed , our election systems are the sloppiest of any industrialized democracy . So sloppy that eight of the 19 hijackers on 9/11 were registered to vote in Virginia or Florida . We need to reform our systems by cleaning up outdated registration rolls , requiring photo IDs , training better poll workers , increasing voter education , and improving electronic voting machines by adding paper receipts . <p> It 's incumbent upon both Congress and the state legislatures to revisit our election laws early next year before memories of this year 's near miss fade away . But the cause of genuine reform will only be set back by conspiracy theories propounded by liberals  --  some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appear quasi-rational . <p> By John H. Fund <p> <p> John H.
