<p> Medicare 's drug benefit , expanding on a practice now in limited use in the private sector , requires patients to pay larger co-payments for expensive treatments , including some drugs for cancer , arthritis , multiple sclerosis and anemia . <p> In the private sector , some employers ' insurance plans charge more for some so-called " lifestyle " drugs , such as impotence treatment Viagra or some allergy remedies . <p> But the Medicare program , which took effect Jan. 1 , expands those charges into new territory : treatments for serious or life-threatening conditions . <p> While most working-age adults have insurance with two or three different " tiers " corresponding to how much they pay at the pharmacy for certain drugs  --  with generics the cheapest and brand-name drugs more  --  about 40% of the Medicare plans have four tiers , according to the analysis by Avalere Health , a for-profit research firm in Washington that did an analysis of the drugs earmarked for higher payments by patients . Fourteen percent have five tiers . <p> In comparison , 4% of workers with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ according to a nationwide survey by the non-profit Kaiser Family Foundation . <p> In that fourth tier  --  where Medicare patients will most commonly pay 25% to 33% of the cost of the drug rather than a flat dollar amount  --  are such expensive treatments as Remicade and Enbrel for rheumatoid arthritis , Procrit and Aranesp for anemia and Copaxone and Betaseron for multiple sclerosis . <p> That differs , says Avalere President Daniel Mendelson and other benefit experts , from the drugs most commonly found in higher " tiers " in employer-offered plans . Often , those tiers are used by employers generally trying to get workers to think twice about taking expensive drugs for non-life-threatening conditions , such as hair loss , allergies or impotence . <p> Prices vary by tiers <p> Tier systems caught on in the late 1990s among employer-offered insurance , initially as a way to get patients to choose lower-cost generic drugs over more expensive brand-name products . <p> The average co-payment now in private insurance is $10 for generics , $22 for brand-name drugs on an insurer 's formulary and $35 for those not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The average co-payment for a fourth-tier drug is $74 . <p> In Medicare , the tier prices vary , but generics are generally $10 or less , according to an analysis of 10 national plans by Avalere , while brand-name drugs range from $17 to $45 per prescription . Tier-four drugs are generally charged at 25% to 33% of the cost of the drug , although one national plan charges $50 to $69 per prescription . <p> Under one plan that charges 25% for drugs in the fourth tier , Medicare patients would pay $231 a month for anemia drug Aranesp , which is often used for cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . <p> A patient taking Remicade for rheumatoid arthritis would pay $143 a month . The most expensive co-payment is in one national plan with a tier charging 75% of the cost of the drugs it places in that category , which include the breast cancer drug Herceptin ( which would cost patients $1,991 a month ) , colon cancer drug Avastin ( $1,839 ) and cancer drug Gemzar ( $92 ) . <p> Medicare officials cite savings <p> Medicare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drug coverage before will save substantially under the new program , even if their drugs are in the fourth tier . Instead of paying the full cost of the drug , the patient will have help from the government , especially after going through the " doughnut hole , " which is the coverage gap during which the patient pays the full cost of the drugs until he or she has spent $3,600 , after which the government pays 95% of the cost . <p> " In the case of Aranesp , the catastrophic ( coverage ) will start by the third month if the beneficiary has no other coverage , " Peter Ashkenaz , spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services , said in an e-mail . " Overall , the savings will be high . " <p> But some patients may not be able to pay their way through the doughnut hole , says Kevin Brennan , senior vice president of policy for the Arthritis Foundation . <p> " They may be out of luck , " he says . <p> In addition , most of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lower-income patients will no longer do so for those with Medicare drug coverage . <p> Overall , Brennan says , the Medicare drug benefit is a step forward , but his organization says it will monitor it closely and may go to Medicare officials with suggestions for changes . His organization is also watching what private insurers do . Some may decide to create similar tier structures in their offerings to workers . <p> " We 're really concerned about that , " says Brennan , who takes an expensive arthritis drug he says has " changed my life as far as my ability to function " and fears such drugs may become too costly , even for those with insurance , if co-payments rise . <p> " We 're looking at a real crisis , " he says . " These are wonderful drugs that are tremendously innovative , but they are incredibly expensive . We as a country are going to have to figure out how to pay for them . " <p> Co-pays worry cancer patients <p> The American Cancer Society is also watching closely . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer , " says Christy Schmidt , senior director of policy . " All insurance companies look at the bottom line and how to control costs . Medicare is often a leader in policy in the nation . We intend to watch this over time . " <p> In 2002 , a policy to charge cancer patients up to $550 per chemotherapy drug and up to $250 per radiation treatment was instituted by PacifiCare for its Medicare managed-care patients . After an outcry , the insurer dropped many of the charges . <p> The Cancer Society says it knows of no current plans that require special cancer co-payments . <p> But as ever-more-expensive drugs hit the market , more employers may begin to set up four-tier drug-benefit programs , says Dave Guilmette , managing director at benefits consulting firm Towers Perrin . <p> " It 's a creative way to manage costs , " says Guilmette . The Medicare drug program " will stimulate a lot more of this kind of design . " <p> But he does n't think many employers will place expensive treatments for life-threatening conditions in fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to require the use of disease-management programs or have insurers insist that patients try lower-cost drugs before moving on to higher-cost ones . <p> " These are people who are typically very sick and need the drugs , " says Guilmette . " If you 're asking them to pay 50% of something costing $20,000 a year , that is n't a competitive practice . " <p> Eric Michael , pharmacy consultant with Mercer Health and Benefits , says that the fourth tier can make sense if employers and insurers are trying to get patients to realize the cost of expensive treatments , so long as there is an out-of-pocket maximum and the benefit is clearly explained . <p> He says some employers need to create such a tier to protect themselves from expensive new treatments that may treat both serious and non-serious conditions . Patients would pay more , for example , if they sought the expensive rheumatoid arthritis treatments Humira or Enbrel for a less serious use , such as for the cosmetic treatment of the rash caused by psoriasis . <p> " We need to make sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " A lot of plans are not putting those checks in place and are amazed when they spend $12,000 to $13,000 a year to cover a cosmetic thing . " After paying $3,600 ... Medicare patients taking fourth-tier drugs will quickly go through their initial coverage period and hit the so-called doughnut hole in coverage , where they pay the full cost of their drugs . After a patient pays $3,600 , Medicare then picks up 95% of the cost of drugs for the rest of the benefit year . <p> For example , Aranesp , under one insurer 's program , would cost the patient $924 a month in the doughnut hole , dropping to $46 once the government 's catastrophic coverage kicks in . <p> PHOTO , B/W , Johnson &; Johnson PHOTO , B/W , Immunex Corp .
