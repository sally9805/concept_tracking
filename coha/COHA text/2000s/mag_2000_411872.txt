Balance fabrics , color , and scale when arranging furniture so your room is great looking and suits the way you live . // Have you ever stood in a room feeling uncomfortable , as if something was n't right ? Perhaps the sofa seems too large , or there is n't enough light or seating where you need it . Poor furniture placement often causes such problems , especially when old furnishings do n't fit in a new home . You can fix these dilemmas if you consider the elements of the room and how they are used . Linda Woodrum , a designer with T.S . Hudson Interiors in Hilton Head , South Carolina , worked with clients in Atlanta to make their new living room meet their needs functionally , while keeping their personalities and casual lifestyle intact . She provided several seating areas within one room for use independently or as a unit and enhanced the architecturally detailed space with texture and richly colored fabrics . The sketch on page 118 illustrates how her plan incorporates both old and new furnishings to create an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the design strategies used to make the room come together . MAINTAINING BALANCE Linda split the room in three sections , each with its own focal point . On one side , the handsome fireplace offers a focus for two club chairs and an ottoman placed opposite the sofa . " It 's ideal for conversational seating with a group or if you just want to sit by the fire and read , " says Linda . By placing the Windsor chairs nearby , a group of six or more can enjoy the fire without feeling crowded . To balance the fireplace , the entertainment center stands on the opposite side , surrounded by additional chairs . " The homeowners knew they wanted a TV in this room , " says Linda , " and this piece is perfect as a counterpart to the fireplace . " The wicker wing chairs , oversize ottoman , and upholstered chair create yet another cozy seating group . In the last section , the Windsor chairs and a skirted table centralize the other seating groups . " This is the room 's focal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front door , " explains Linda . OLD VS . NEW The space is filled with several new pieces the homeowners purchased to coordinate with their existing furniture . " They fell in love with a lot of furniture I had used in another project , " says Linda , " and that 's where our inspiration came from . " The wicker wing chairs , sofa , and entertainment center , all examples of newly added items , reflect the initial casual feeling . They work beautifully in scale with the original club chairs , ottoman , and Windsor chairs . COLOR , TEXTURE , AND FABRIC This space is bathed in light colors to create an inviting feeling . " The room has strong architectural bones with a warm personality , " says Linda . " We did n't want to overpower , so we kept the color palette neutral but with rich and clean undertones .

Its location opposite the front door makes it another welcoming focal point . // Textures such as wicker , chenille , and wood combine for warmth . The sofa 's clean white lines provide a neutral buffer between the two seating areas , while the other fabrics offer unity . " The homeowners had a library of color swatches they love , and we worked everything around those fabrics , " Linda explains . LIGHTING By using several types of lighting , the room accommodates a variety of uses , while maintaining the intimacy the homeowners wanted . The suspended bell-shaped fixture over the skirted table creates instant mood and classic style by illuminating the center of the room with just the right degree of ambience . Floor lamps provide task lighting , and recessed lights allow degrees of overhead light throughout , adjusting to any level with a dimmer .

Linda purposefully selected new pieces to complement their existing ones so they could fill the space . MAKING IT WORK FOR YOU Use live plants for scale . Palm , ficus , or smaller plants on stands lend height and color to rooms with high ceilings . Substantial pieces of art or groups of framed objects also add height and depth to the furniture groupings . Mix fabrics to add visual warmth . COllect swatches while you plan so there is a flow of color and unity in your design . Tip : One or two compatible patterns work well with textured solids . Texture can be found in fabrics , floor coverings , and even in some wallpapers or finishes . Consider using woven grass rugs as an alternative to custom floor coverings .
