Later I figured I got involved , and almost killed , for three reasons : the money , the case itself , and Zee 's uncharacteristic detachment from the world we shared . If you live on Martha 's Vineyard you can always use more money , and the job interested me because it concerned works of art whose history caught my fancy . Most of all , though , I probably agreed to work for Mahsimba because , during an especially warm and lovely spring , Zee had become curiously spellbound and ethereal , like a teenaged girl . Her dreaminess had continued on into June and had disconnected her from our normal family life . She was as efficient as ever at her work in the emergency room at the hospital , but she seemed lost in obscure thoughts when at home with the children and me , as though she were seeing the world with the eyes of one who had once been blind . I had several thoughts about the cause of this , none having anything to do with the others . Perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year before , even though she 'd done it to save herself and our daughter and had taken a gunshot in the process . Or maybe it was a sort of sustained spring fever . Or maybe she was experiencing some form of the seven-year itch . That would n't be too surprising , considering my own certainty of my limitations as a husband . But when I asked her the cause of her sea change , she only pressed her forefinger to my lips and wordlessly shook her head . Whatever the cause of her enchantment , there seemed to be nothing I could do about it , so I determined to remain unchanged myself , to stay the man whose love had once given her joy , and to hope that it still did or would again , however dreamily removed from me she seemed to be for the nonce . When Mahsimba came into my life I was glad to accept a job that would oblige me to think of something else . Before the phone rang , I was alone in the house . Zee was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cats were off catting somewhere outside . I was finishing my morning coffee and reading the Vineyard Gazette 's sixth-months-later story about the Headless Horseman . That still-unidentified body had long since been placed in some mainland morgue or grave , but on the Vineyard its notoriety had lessened only slightly since the previous December , when an understandably shocked pony rider had discovered it beside a frosty bridle path up in West Tisbury . The equestrian connection explained half of the corpse 's nickname , and its missing head accounted for the other half . It could have been called the Handless Horseman , for that matter , because the hands were missing , too , along with the corpse 's clothes . Naked , headless , and handless corpses are not common on Martha 's Vineyard , especially in the dead of winter , so locally the discovery had caused quite a stir . Speculation swirled about who had died and why and who had done the deed , and there was much conjecture that someone with a horse was involved since that was clearly how the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police , there are many horses and riders on the island and not one of them seemed the type to kill and behead people . The how was easier ; the man , white and in his forties , according to medical reports , had been shot right in the pump with what appeared to be a .38- or .40-caliber bullet . Before this happened , he had apparently been in good physical condition , but that was about all anyone had learned about him . He did n't fit any of the missing person reports that the police had received , and now , half a year later , he was as unknown as ever . The Gazette report , consistent with that famous newspaper 's policy of not emphasizing the island 's darker side , was short and on a middle page , and contented itself with a brief review of the facts and of the questions that people still talked about : Who was the guy and who had killed him and why ? These questions continued to bother those of the island 's citizens who did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vineyard with a killer . I , however , was not one of the worriers , because it had been a long time since I 'd thought that my island home actually was akin to Eden before the Fall . My Vineyard , for all its fabled loveliness , had its share of snakes living under the rocks . But I had not moved to the island to get involved with such creatures . I had done enough of that during five years on the Boston PD . The bullet I still carried next to my spine as a consequence of wearing a shield had only been the last factor that led me to decide to let somebody else save the world . I had better things to do . That very day , for example , I had veggie and flower gardens to tend , floors to vacuum , supper to prepare , a leak in my waders that I had to find and patch , another leak in the ceiling of the porch that I had to track down and fix , clothes to wash , shopping to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the bluefish had been in for a couple of weeks , and I still had more of them to catch . Ordinarily I could think of little that was more pleasurable than being on the beach doing battle with the blues , and this year fishing was doubly appealing because it also served to distract me from fretting about Zee . I was just beginning to fret some more when Stanley Crandel phoned . " J.W. , that you ? " " Stanley , where are you ? Up at the house ? " " No . London . Just got here from Africa . Went from Cape Town to Cairo . Terrific trip ! That 's what I 'm calling about . Met this man in Harare . Interesting fellow . Seems he 's going to the Vineyard . I wonder if you 'll show him around , help him out . " " When 's he coming ? " " He may be there already . I put him in touch with John Skye , and he 'll be staying at John 's place because Betsy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " What 's he need me for ? " " It 's a long story , and this call 's costing me a fortune . He 'll explain it when he sees you . Will you meet him ? " " Well ... " " You 'll be doing me a favor . " I hate it when people say that . " All right , " I said . " I knew I could depend on you , J.W. I told him to call you from John 's house when he gets in . His name 's Mahsimba . Thanks . Got ta go . " The phone clicked and buzzed in my ear . I shook my head at the thought of a phone call being too expensive for Stanley Crandel to bear . Stanley and his wife , Betsy , owned one of the biggest houses on East Chop , where Crandels had been summering for a hundred years . Stanley liked to think that he was a descendant of John Saunders , the onetime Virginia slave who , some said , was later the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time since Stanley 's line of Crandels had been slaves to anything but high finance . This fact notwithstanding , it was typical of Stanley and Betsy simultaneously to be generous to friends , family , and charities , and yet to squeeze their pennies till they screamed . Maybe they had so many pennies precisely because they pinched them so hard . Maybe that was true of all wealthy people , including the other aristocratic and upper-middle-class African-American citizens of Oak Bluffs . I would n't know , being an outsider to such social circles . I knew Stanley and Betsy because I opened their house in the spring , closed it again in the fall , and looked after it all year long . I 'd gotten the job because Stanley and John Skye had gone to college together and John had given Stanley my name . I also opened and closed John 's place and cared for it while he and his family were up in Weststock during the winter , where he professed things medieval at the college . I tended to other houses , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to be willing to do a lot of things . And now , apparently , I was going to have yet another bit of work : showing Mr. Mahsimba around the Vineyard and helping him achieve whatever he had in mind . I thought of John Skye and his family , and was glad I 'd gotten the farm ready for their arrival . The twins were now in college , so they 'd be getting out of school at the same time as their father did . Thus , all of the Skyes might be descending from America any day now . I presumed that John would arrive before Mr. Mahsimba did . I wondered what Mr. Mahsimba 's long story would be , but there was no way to guess . I went back to perusing the Gazette . Since I 'd taken the phone call , the Headless Horseman was still unidentified , and the case was still open as unsolved murder cases always are . I thought about the Woman in the Dunes , over on Cape Cod . There were similarities between her case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body had been found years before in the sand dunes , her jeans folded neatly beside her . She was still unidentified after many years . A very cold case , but one that was still open . The latest effort at identifying her involved opening the grave and attempting DNA tests , which had n't been available when she 'd first been found . I imagined that DNA evidence had also been taken from the Horseman , but that nothing had been done with it because of the absence of comparable samples . I put the paper down , stopped thinking about crime , finished my coffee , and considered the many things that needed doing . An old guy once told me that the good part about being retired is that you still have lots of things to do but you do n't have to do them . I was n't quite retired , so I still had to do them , but I had some choices about when and in which order . So I went fishing . It was still early enough in the season for Norton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , over the sand from Katama toward Chappy . Soon impassioned Department of Fish and Wildlife agents would close Norton Point to ORV traffic on the grounds that passing trucks disturbed nesting and fledging plovers . It was one of those governmental decisions that explains anarchism , since the real threats to plovers , as even the beach-closers knew , were gulls , skunks , and other wild predators . Maddening . When I 'm king , I 'm shipping all of the plovers and environmentalists to No Man 's Land , where they can care for one another and not bother the rest of us . The world will thank me for it . I stopped here and there and made casts into the light southwest wind . I caught nothing , but that was okay , because it was a lovely early June day , with bright sun and a clear light blue sky arching down and meeting the dark blue ocean on the southern horizon . If you sailed that way , the first land you 'd come to would be Hispaniola , which was well beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hole and got one lone five-pound blue which apparently had no friends . I cut his throat , rinsed him off , and put him on the ice in the fish box , then went on to Wasque . Wasque Point is the southeastern corner of Chappaquiddick , the peninsula hooked to the rest of the Vineyard by Norton Point Beach . When the water broke through the beach between the ocean and Katama Bay , Chappy became an island and remained one until Neptune in his wisdom closed the opening again . Wasque is one of the best places in the world to catch bluefish , because of the tides that form the Wasque rip , where bait is tossed about and the blues go after it . When conditions are right you can slaughter the blues at Wasque . They were n't perfect that morning , but they were good enough , and the surf casters who were stretched in a line along the beach in front of their four-by-fours were busy and happy . I became one of them , and when I finally broke off and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything you threw , filling the air with the scent of watermelon . In town I sold all of my fish but one and took that one home . On the filleting table behind our shed I scaled and filleted the fish and then took the fillets into the house and put them in the fridge . We 'd have stuffed bluefish for supper . Delish ! My mouth was already watering . It was a little past noon and I was having my first Sam Adams of the day when the phone rang again . John Skye 's voice was on the other end . " The groves of academe have shed the Skyes for another summer , " said John . " We 're here . " " If I 'd known that a little earlier , I 'd have brought you a bluefish . " " I can catch my own bluefish , thanks . Are you busy right now ? " " I 'm drinking a beer , but it wo n't take long to finish it . " " Fine . Come on over . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is Mahsimba.
