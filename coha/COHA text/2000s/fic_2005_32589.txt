1 In another month the New Orleans lakefront would stink of fish , filth , and boat fuel , but right now it was a softly gorgeous spring day on Lakeshore Drive . Two young men sat on the seawall , their feet propped on the algae-slimed steps that descended into the murky brown water . Behind them , the levee rose up lush and green ; before them was a vista of sailboats , small yachts , an occasional Coast Guard cutter , and far in the distance , the causeway that stretches twenty-four miles across Lake Pontchartrain to Mandeville , Covington , and other pretty little towns collectively known by sardonic city dwellers as " New Orleans North . " One of the young menhis name was Gary Stubbs , but everyone called him G-manhad a cane pole baited with a rubber worm . He sat with his long legs crossed , the pole balanced on the fulcrum of his knee , and stared out at the boats on the sparkling water . His myopic eyes had always been painfully sensitive to light , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a headache . G-man was n't the kind of person who got a lot of headaches , though two years of restaurant co-ownership had certainly increased his familiarity with them . Like many native New Orleanians , he had known how to fish for most of his life , but he was not especially dedicated to the practice . Today he would have been unlikely to notice if Leviathan had risen from the depths and clamped onto his line . His attention was wholly absorbed by a creased and partly crumpled piece of newspaper from which his friend was reading aloud . His friend was John Rickey , generally addressed as Rickey except by the younger and more timid underlings in therestaurant 's kitchen , who just called him Chef . He read in a loud , fierce voice , gesticulating to emphasize points that struck him as particularly egregious . Rickey was very much the kind of person who got a lot of headaches . They had been together for more than a decade , had worked in kitchens all over New Orleans , had sauted , chopped , guzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lower Ninth Ward diner to chef-owners of an award-winning and successful restaurant . The restaurant had been Rickey 's idea from the beginning , and though he had recently insisted on making G-man his co-chef rather than his sous chef , he was still in charge . Rickey always had to be in charge of everything he did ; otherwise it did n't strike him as worth doing . He was sharp-featured and intense , handsome despite a slight tendency toward paunchiness . Even the article he was reading commented on his good looks , though that seemed to irk him as much as everything else about it . " Like so many youthful ventures , Liquor is a fine example of why no one under thirty-five should be put in charge of anything . ' " Liquor was their restaurant , so named because all the dishes featured that ingredient ; as Rickey had predicted , it was an idea perfectly suited to this most alcoholic of cities . " The menu shows a certain ambition , verve , and raw talent . So may have the young Michelangelo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' What the fuck is the Louvre , G ? What does any of that mean ? " " I think it 's a museum , " said G-man , hoping Rickey would n't pursue the other question , though he knew he might as well hope for Jesus Christ to come strolling across the lake and put a nice bull redfish on his line . He tilted his face up to the cloudless sky , concentrated on the lapping water , the bass on a passing car 's stereo , the gulls screeching and mewing and saying " You ! You ! " It was relaxing out here , or would be if Rickey would let it . This was one of the places they 'd always come for peace : from their families when they were still teenagers living at home , from the stress and exhaustion of the various kitchen jobs they 'd held during most of their twenties , from their own restaurant over the past couple of years . He felt as if Rickey was n't honoring that peace now , and it made him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrepreneurs have to come up with their own cash , ' " Rickey read . " These two gentlemen have n't even done that , instead relying on Daddy 's money . Celebrity restaurateur and Maine native Lenny Duveteaux is n't really either chef 's father , but he may as well be for all the work they had to do to obtain his considerable financing . The question of why he chose to bankroll them remains ' " G-man tucked the end of his fishing pole under his arm , reached over , and snatched the article out of Rickey 's hand . Before Rickey could grab it back , he had torn it into small pieces and scattered it on the surface of the lake . " There , " he said . " Maybe now I 'll get a bite . I always heard it helps if you chum the water with something really rank . " Rickey stared at him , speechless . G-man stared back , meeting Rickey 's bright blue eyes with his own calm brown ones . There were n't many people who could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each other since elementary school , had fallen in love at sixteen , had pretty much stood together against everything life threw at them since then . Rickey could do a lot of things , but he could n't intimidate G-man . After a couple of minutes , Rickey shook his head and laughed . There was n't much humor in that laugh , but G-man supposed it was a start . " You know I 'm just gon na get another copy , " Rickey said . " The goddamn paper 's free . You can pick it up all over town . " " Yeah , but until you do , I wo n't have to listen to it anymore . " " I think I got parts of it memorized . " " Rickey " Whatever G-man had been about to say was cut off by the ringing of Rickey 's cell phone . Rickey removed it from the side pocket of his mushroom-patterned chef pants , glanced briefly at the caller ID . " Lenny , " he said . " Again . " " You gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't feel like it . " The phone stopped ringing . " You ought to do it sometime today . That article fucked him over pretty good too . " " I know . I just ca n't do it yet . Daddy 's money , " Rickey said bitterly . He 'd been making wishful noises about buying out Lenny 's share of the restaurant for a while now , and this phrase in particular rankled . He started to return the phone to his pocket , but before he could , it rang again . Without any apparent premeditation , Rickey pulled his arm back , snapped his wrist forward , and sent the phone flying out across Lake Pontchartrain . It skipped a couple of times and was gone forever . " Dude ! " " I did n't even know I was gon na do that , " said Rickey , who looked just as surprised as G-man . " Dude ! " " What ? " " Was that the phone from the walk-in ? " " Yeah , " Rickey admitted guiltily . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in his office at Crescent , one of two successful local restaurants he owned . He had come to New Orleans more than a decade ago , fallen in love with the place , and proceeded to make his own indelible mark on its culinary landscape . Now he ran a pair of restaurants , had published a bestselling series of cookbooks , marketed his own spice line , made frequent appearances on Leno and Letterman . A couple of years ago he 'd heard about a young cook who had a great idea for a restaurant , but no money to pull it off . In a city where public drunkenness was considered a right and sometimes even an obligation , Lenny knew a menu based on liquor would pull in both tourists and locals . Fortunately , the young cook was talented enough to back up his gimmick with excellent food . Lenny decided to invest in the idea . That was how he 'd gotten involved with Rickey and G-man . Lenny was a stocky man , broad through the shoulders and thick in the neck , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as if he were thinking about starting a beard . His square face was otherwise unremarkable except when he smiled , which made him appear demented . He was not smiling now . He had a closet full of expensive clothes , but right now he wore a pair of houndstooth check pants with frayed cuffs , a white chef jacket , and a New Orleans Saints baseball cap . He did n't look like a multimillionaire , let alone the " dangerously ruthless businessman " this rag accused him of being . On his desk was a copy of Cornet , a biweekly giveaway paper that covered New Orleans entertainment , food , and politics . This issue 's cover story was about a dowser who had been brought to town in hopes of divining the exact location of Buddy Bolden 's grave in Holt Cemetery , the local potter 's field . A marker shaped like a musical note had already been erected for the jazz pioneer , but no one was sure whether it marked the right spot ; he 'd been buried in an unmarked grave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him . Ordinarily Lenny would have been interested in the storyhe liked old-time jazz , and the dowser was from Maine , his home statebut today he was only interested in what passed for Cornet 's restaurant review . LIQUOR ? I HARDLY KNOW HER ! By Humphrey Wildblood Much has been made recently of the so-called Broad Street restaurant renaissance . It is true that a certain Mid-City stretch of Broad near the New Orleans courthouse/jail complexformerly a rather bleak industrial area rife with bail bondsmen , gas stations , muffler shops , and the likenow boasts a number of upscale restaurants of varying quality . The restaurant usually credited with beginning this renaissance is Liquor , located at Toulouse and Broad . Though Chef John Rickey describes the menu as " eclectic French-influenced , " local diners know it better as " that place that puts booze in everything . " As well they might , for that is the first gimmick that made this restaurant famous , though unfortunately not the last . Food cognoscenti and haunters of bookstores ' true-crime sections may recall the gripping events @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if choreographed . A grudge-bearing former boss of Rickey 's trapped him in the restaurant 's walk-in cooler , threatened his life , and actually winged him with a bullet before Rickey was able to use his cell phone to alert coworkers to his plight . Readers who wish to know more can find the full story in Dark Kitchen , a sensational little paperback penned by Chase Haricot , the former Times-Picayune food critic who gave Liquor a glowing four-out-of-five-bean review . I am here neither to question Haricot 's motives nor to examine the questionable wisdom of using red beans to rate fine-dining establishments . I am here only to suggest that a near-tragedy in the kitchenthough it may fascinate Gourmet , Bon Apptit , and other denizens of the American food pressdoes not a great restaurant make . The aforementioned publications came to Liquor for the story , stayed for the food , and appear to have been impressed . ( Bon Apptit spoke of " innovative cuisine with an impeccable grounding in local and global culinary tradition , " whatever that may mean . ) It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photographs of Rickey , a handsome fellow with a winning smile . Chefs are sexy these days , you know . Doubtless it is only a matter of time before the better culinary schools require 8x10 glossies to be submitted with all applications . Rickey runs the kitchen with his co-chef , Gary " G-man " Stubbs , a lanky young man with the slightly dazed expression of a California surfer who 's just smoked a lid of dynamite grass . The two have worked together for most of their careers . Both are thirty years old , both lifelong New Orleanians complete with dat scrappy ole how's-ya-mama'n'em Lower Ninth Ward accent , just a couple local boys who done made good .

The question of why he chose to bankroll them remains unanswered . Some sources say Duveteauxchef/owner of Lenny 's in the French Quarter and Crescent on Magazine Streetbelieved he had lost touch with contemporary cuisine and hoped these hip young chefs would restore his credibility . This seems unlikely , since Crescent is already excruciatingly hip and the two young chefs were nobodies when Duveteaux met them . More sinister motives have also been suggested . Lenny Duveteaux is known in certain circles as " the Nixon of the New Orleans restaurant world . " He is said to record all his telephone conversations , indexing the tapes in his office by the hundreds , and to have the sort of business connections you do n't want to cross if you value your health . A former associate remarked on the condition of anonymity , " Lenny is a dangerously ruthless businessman . He plays by the rulesthe problem is that he also makes the rules .

Like so many youthful ventures , Liquor is a fine example of why no one under thirty-five should be put in charge of anything . The menu shows a certain ambition , verve , and raw talent . So may have the young Michelangelo 's daubings , but they do not belong in the Louvre . I concede that my meals at Liquor have been well-prepared and reasonably tasty . The problem lies not in the execution but in the conception . A year after it opened , Liquor won a James Beard award for Best Newcomer , something that does n't impress locals much but continues to bring in culinary tourists by the score . Sadly , the publicity and acclaim seem to have gone to the heads of Chefs Rickey and Stubbs ; they want to have it both ways , wooing the out-of-town foodies but still professing to stay true to their roots . The result is a menu that lacks basic coherenceit 's almost a stunt .

Is Liquor a contemporary Louisiana restaurant ? Is it one of those upscale American places that mingle the culinary traditions of France , Italy , and other hazily imagined Old Countries with no regard for accuracy or palatability ? You may decide for yourself , since the chefs surely can'tthese days , " eclectic " seems to be a code word for " I do n't know what the hell I 'm doing . " But at least they look good doing it . Lenny had already read the article three or four times , but he still could n't quite take it in . Though he 'd had his share of bad reviews , he had never seen one like this . He was n't even certain it was a review ; it scarcely mentioned the food , seeming rather to take umbrage at Liquor 's hype , Rickey 's looks , and , of course , Lenny 's involvement . That had to be the kicker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into business with them . G-man , who was so easygoing that Lenny occasionally wanted to give him a good shake , had no known enemies . Rickey 's only enemyMike Mouton , the former boss who 'd tried to shoot himwas currently cooling his heels in Angola Prison . Lenny , though , had plenty of enemies . He knew the article was directed at him , though he did n't suppose that would be any comfort to Rickey . He dialed Rickey 's cell number again . This time it did n't even ring , but shunted him off to a recording that told him the number was temporarily out of service . He checked the recording light on the tape machine attached to his phone , then called his attorney , Oscar De La Cerda . He knew De La Cerda had read the article , because he 'd faxed it to the lawyer earlier today . " Run down our options for me , " he said without preamble when De La Cerda answered . " I know this is actionable , but tell me the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to approach it is to stay the hell away from it , " said De La Cerda . " It 's obvious this guy 's a wingnut . Do n't give him the satisfaction of acknowledging him , and make sure Rickey does n't either . " " Bullshit . We do n't answer the charges , we look like we 're admitting to them . " " That 's what I figured you 'd say , " sighed De La Cerda . " OK . Everything he says about the restaurant is a matter of opinionthat 's not actionable . The stuff he says about you is murkier , legally speaking . We can make a good case for libel , but he can probably duck all the charges . "
