Forget what you 've read about the ocean . Forget white sails on a blue horizon , the romance of it , the beauty . A picnic basket in a quiet anchorage , the black-tipped flash of gulls . The sound of the wind like a pleasant song , the curved spine of the coast  - -   - -   no . Such images belong to shore . They have nothing whatsoever to do with the sea . Imagine a place of infinite absence . An empty ballroom , the colors muted , the edges lost in haze . The sort of dream you have when you 've gone beyond exhaustion to a strange , otherworldly country , a place I 'd visited once before in the months that followed the birth of my son , when days and nights blurred into a single lost cry , when I 'd find myself standing over the crib , or rocking him , breathing the musk of his hair , or lying in bed beside Rex 's dark shape , unable to recall how I 'd gotten there . As if I 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole , into another . Day after day , week after week , the lack of sleep takes its toll . You begin to see things that may or may not be there . You understand how the sailors of old so willingly met their deaths on the rocks , believing in visions of beautiful women , sirens , mermaids with long , sparkling hair . The crest of awave becomes a human face , openmouthed , white-eyed , astonished . The spark of a headlight appears in the sky , edges closer , fades , edges closer still . There 's a motion off the bow , and I clutch at the helm , catch myself thinking , Turn ! But , eventually , I learn to let my eyes fall out of focus . Blink , look again . Wipe my sweating face . There is nothing out there but gray waves , gray waves . Clouds . A translucent slice of moon . Space . We alternated watches , Rex and I : four hours on , four hours off . We had a ship 's clock that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sextant , a handheld GPS . We had an outdated radar system ; we had a small refrigerator , a water maker , clothing and books sealed in plastic wrap . We had five hundred pounds of canned goods , nuts , dried fruit and beans , powdered milk . We had a ship 's log , where we jotted down notes : latitude and longitude , course and speed , wind direction , weather , unusual observations . We had a float plan , which we left with my brother , Toby ; he posted it in the fish store , on the bulletin board behind the cash - register . People stopped by with farewell gifts : cookies sealed in Tupperware , a book of crossword puzzles , religious cards , funny cards , cards simply wishing us well . Everyone in Fox Harbor knew why we were leaving , of course , and this was another reason why I 'd agreed to rent our house and move onto the sailboat Rex had bought in Portland , Maine . Our first destination was Bermuda , our ETA three to five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Bahamas , island-hop down to the Caicos . Perhaps we 'd - winter over in Puerto Rico . Or perhaps we 'd cross the ocean to Portugal  --  who could say ? We might even head to Panama , pass through the canal , find our way north along the coast to the Mexican Bajas . So much depended on weather , on wind . On our own day-to-day inclinations . The plan , Rex liked to tell people , is not to have a plan . It had always been Rex 's dream to live aboard a sailboat , and Chelone was exactly the boat that he had wanted . A blue water boat , he called her . A boat built to sail around the world . He 'd grown up on Cape Cod , sailing with his father ; at twenty , he was captain of his college sailing team , and before heading west to Madison for law school , he 'd worked as a mate aboard a private schooner , cruising the Virgin Islands . On cold winter nights as we lay in bed , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd tell me about the islands he 'd seen , casuarina trees and pink sand beaches , sailboats at anchor outside each rustic harbor . Passing these boats , you 'd see dogs racing from bow to stern , bicycles lashed to the safety lines , laundry fluttering from the rigging . Entire families spent their whole lives just cruising from place to place , dropping anchor wherever they chose . No bills to pay , no responsibilities . You did n't like your neighbor , no problem , you sailed away . Maybe , he 'd whisper , his breath warm against my neck , we could do the same thing someday . I like our neighbors fine , Rex . Seriously . I am serious . At the time , I could n't imagine saying good-bye to Toby , to my friends at the accounting firm where I worked , to our fieldstone house overlooking the lake , to the small , Wisconsin town where I 'd been raised . Still , after years spent trying to conceive a child , after the shots and surgeries , the herbal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the infant of a teenage girl who changed her mind , I started to pay more attention whenever Rex talked about heading to sea . I leafed through his copies of Practical Sailor , his scrapbook of sail plans and hull designs . I studied the glossy brochures he - received from boat builders around the world . I 'd always enjoyed sailing , and though I 'd only sailed on the Great Lakes , I figured that the ocean could n't be all that different . Water was water , after all . You wore a life jacket . You learned to hang on . Then , one week before my fortieth birthday , I discovered I was pregnant with Evan . After eleven years of marriage , we were - finally  --  unexpectedly  --  about to have a child . Our plans no longer belonged to us , and the truth was that we gave them up eagerly . We wanted to make sacrifices . We wanted to shake our heads ruefully , saying , But then we had the baby so we could n't . . .
