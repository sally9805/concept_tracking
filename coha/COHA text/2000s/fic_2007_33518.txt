the way we were When I was little , my parents held hands in public . Wandering through grocery stores , in movie theaters , at Linda Vista Elementary School 's end-of-the-year carnival . Everywhere . It was embarrassing . They held hands even when we begged them not to . As a result of this constant hand-holding and all that went along with it , I am not an only child . There are three of us : my older brother , Allen , is seventeen , I 'm fifteen , and my sister , Keatie , is eight . When I was in ninth grade , the hand-holding stopped , much to my relief . Maybe I would n't have been so relieved if I 'd realized what that might mean . Lately , my family has been different . My full-time family has always been my mom , Allen , me , and Keatie . My dad works a lot , so I think of him as more of a part-timer . He comes on vacations with us , is around on weekday mornings and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My mom complains a lot about how much he works , but the complaints have n't changed anything yet . The full-time family has always been pretty tight , but lately things have been getting a little . . . loose . We used to hang out together ; we 'd sit at the same table and do homework while my mom paid bills , or we 'd read magazines or play video games ( okay , so I do n't really play video games , but I 'd be there when my brother and sister did ) . We even sat around and talked sometimes , like families on TV do . During the past few months , Mom has been working more , and Allen 's been gone a lot . Keatie and I watch more TV and talk a lot less than we used to . That does n't sound like a big deal , probably , but it feels like a big deal to me . I mean , my family is n't boring , exactly , but we have routines :  - -  We eat dinner at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performance or a violin recital or a soccer game or whatever going on . My dad only makes it to a couple of dinners a week -- always on Sundays , and then usually at least one other day . He works a lot , even on weekends .  - -  Every Friday my brother and sister and I have pizza or Chinese food or some other kind of takeout for dinner , because that 's my parents ' " date night . " When he 's in a good mood , Allen gives them an obnoxious piece of advice like " Now , remember , Maggie "  - -  that 's my mom 's name --  " do n't think that just because he buys you dinner you owe him something , " and then he winks at her , or he 'll remind my dad to use protection , or he 'll tell them they have their whole lives ahead of them and they should n't put all that at risk for a few minutes of fun . He 's big on making people as uncomfortable as humanly possible .  - -  On Saturdays we clean the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they ca n't do anything fun until they finish their assigned chore.  - -  My mom puts us each to bed every night . She does n't tuck us in or anything , she just likes to talk to us before we go to bed . Most nights before I go to sleep , I tell my mom about school , and boys , and who said what about whom . I guess I tell her everything .  - -  My dad makes our lunches for school every night and puts them in the refrigerator for us so that they 're ready and waiting for us in the morning . Unfortunately , he is a big fan of bologna sandwiches , and most of the rest of us are n't . My sandwiches usually end up in the garbage . Allen 's friend Julian eats his every once in a while . I do n't know what Keatie does with hers .  - -  Keatie , Allen , and I watch Jeopardy ! together ; sometimes Mom or Dad will watch with us . Okay , so we do n't just watch it . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep score . ( I never said these routines were n't embarrassing or ridiculous . ) Or we 'll each pick a contestant at the beginning and whoever 's contestant wins does n't have to do dishes .  - -  My dad takes one of us to lunch once a month . I think this was my mom 's idea ; when Dad started working a lot , we did n't see him much , and one night Keatie asked my mom when her real dad was coming home . My mom asked her what she meant by her " real dad " and Keatie said , " You know , the one who lives at home , like on TV . The dad we have lives at work . " Mom sort of flipped out and Dad started picking us up from school every once in a while and taking us to lunch . I did n't realize how much I depended on these habits , on the routine , on not having to think or worry about how my family functioned . I did n't realize how much I liked or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lose things to see them for what they really are . Which sounds stupid and obvious and cliched , like that song my mom sometimes listens to in the car about paving paradise and putting up a parking lot . wheels of fortune I guess I began to notice that something was wrong about three months ago . The three of us , Allen , Keatie , and I , were sitting in the living room , waiting for Jeopardy ! to come on , watching Wheel of Fortune and guessing at the answer to a puzzle with only three letters -- all Ts -- showing . It looked like this : T T T Title Keatie guessed , " The Cat in the Hat . . . no , wait . . . Stand Up to . . . " I guessed , " Stick My Toe . . . Italy Is Too . . . " Allen did n't bother guessing . " You guys suck . It 's Allen Rules the Universe , Obey His Every Command . " " Al , you always say that 's what the answer is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ About then my parents came down the hall into the living room . They were arguing . My dad said something like " I want you to stop acting like my mother , that 's all . " And my mom said something like " I want you to stop acting like a child , then . " We did n't say anything . I do n't know what they were fighting about . It would have been easier to guess the answer to an impossible puzzle with three Ts showing than to even begin trying to understand what was going on between them . And at that point , worrying about my parents ' relationship seemed as unnecessary as finding the answer to a puzzle on a stupid TV show . They were fine , holding hands or not . There was nothing to see ; we kept on driving , did n't even think about slowing down . From the Hardcover edition .
