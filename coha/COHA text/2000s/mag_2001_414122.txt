// The Bluebird Cafe , Hillsboro Pike , Wednesday afternoon Singer/songwriter Paul Jefferson ambles into The Bluebird Cafe , a tiny but well-known live music showcase southwest of downtown Nashville . The Bluebird , distinguished by a faded blue-and-white awning , perches in a strip shopping mall near Bradford Center . All is quiet and dark now ; the cafe is closed during the day . Paul raps on the glass , and someone unlocks the front door . Once inside , he maneuvers his guitar case and lanky frame past the maze of tightly spaced tables , then eases down in a chair next to the small stage . The walls are plastered with countless photographs of stars from all walks of musical life who have played at this legendary lounge . Vince Gill . Garth Brooks . Melissa Etheridge . Amy Grant . Bonnie Raitt . Donna Summer . As Paul concentrates on his playlist , a small group of disoriented tourists comes in unnoticed through the front door . " We beg your pardon , " one of them timidly asks him . " Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're not Southern . They 're from London , England , visiting Nashville , and they 've heard about The Bluebird . " It 's quite a bit smaller than I had imagined , " one of them says , looking around the cozy room about the size of a ( cluttered ) two-car garage . " Will there be a performance this evening ? " Paul gives them a quick grin and perky reply . " Listen , come back tonight about 9 o'clock , and you 'll hear some good music , " he answers . No , they 've never heard of him . Yes , they 'll be back . Departing with smiles and apologies , they leave the musician to get ready for the good music he 's just promised . Paul methodically opens his guitar case , pulls out a brilliant turquoise acoustic guitar , grabs a cup of coffee , and returns to his playlist . His songs . His hopes and dreams , reduced to the common currency of instrument and inspiration . Within a half hour , the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a quick sound check . They run through a couple of songs , joke around , then return the cafe to its darkened silence . But what a difference a few hours make . Later that evening , The Bluebird soars with sound and excitement . The Paul Jefferson Band goes onstage at 9 p.m. , playing its blend of country/western/rock music to a packed house , including the four British visitors who had wandered in that afternoon . They 're smiling , excited , and delighted to be here . It 's exactly what many people come to Nashville for : some of the best live music in the country . The Bluebird holds only 100-plus music lovers , but the overflow crowd seems quite willing to stand outside and listen to small speakers tucked under the awning . Paul 's songs are clever and creative ; his " Check , Please " is a hilarious account of a marriage  --  minded date . His stage presence , good looks , great backup band , and flashy smile all glow with star potential . Whatever the gender , whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless other musicians who come to Nashville from all over the country with stars in their eyes and songs in their hearts . ( Paul , for example , is from a rural area of the Santa Cruz Mountains in California . ) And as he alludes to in his song " I Might Just Make It , " some songwriters and musicians make it , and some do n't . Some are content to eke out a living playing clubs here and there , being the opening act for bigger names on tours , or even holding a daytime job to finance their love for the music . And some are too talented to ignore , although this town crawls with musical geniuses . The good news for you is that on any given night , you can hear top-quality live music , often for a song . Let 's drop in on a few more places to hear music in Nashville . This is just a sampler of sorts , not intended to be comprehensive but rather a teasing of who might be onstage when you 're in town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , matinee performance , Tuesday afternoon , 3 p.m . The Grand Ole Opry presents more talent  --  per-minute ( and music-per-dollar ) than any other musical venue , and it has been doing it nonstop for more than 75 years . This afternoon 's show hits some high notes with host Porter Wagoner , the flashy-dressed , ageless ( he 's actually 70 ) Dick Clark of country music , singing and yukking it up with the amiable crowd . Headlining the matinee are country music legend Loretta Lynn and country superstar Martina McBride . Also appearing are show regulars and Grand Ole Opry members Little Jimmy Dickens , Riders in the Sky ( a quartet of campy , Texas-swing troubadours ) , and John Coulee ( who cowrote the hit " Rose Colored Glasses " ) .

You might find Paul Jefferson performing at The Bluebird Cafe or perhaps John Conlee and Martina McBride at the Grand Ole Opry . Then you can hit the floor at Legends Corner . // The crowd at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They 're much more the family type but no less into the music . They love the show , love the performers , and the feelings are certainly returned . " I love playing here at the Grand Ole Opry , " says Martina McBride , talking from her dressing room backstage after the performance . " I remember when John her husband'and I moved to Nashville from Kansas ; I dreamed about playing here . There was no question that Nashville was the place to go . The tradition just runs so deep here . I 'm just as excited about playing at the Opry now as I was the first time I went onstage . Not as nervous though , " she says with a laugh . Broadway/downtown , Saturday night You can feel the excitement in the air in downtown Nashville when the sun goes down and the neon lights glow . Music seems to ring out from every street corner , and it 's no wonder . Several music clubs and cafes cluster near the Ryman Auditorium , the grande dame of all music halls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( much the rarity ) , you 're bound to find somebody playing somewhere else .
