Diet and exercise may be at the forefront , but your mind-set plays an equally important part Photograph Karyn Calabrese , a 59-year-old vegetarian , is among a number of people who believe that a person 's mind-set is one of the most important elements in creating a healthy lifestyle . // WHEN Karyn Calabrese 's grandmother died at age 50 , it was alarming to her family . But when her mother died at 48 , it literally changed her life . " All the women in my family died overweight and very young , and I was very sickly myself , " says Calabrese , a holistic health leader and teacher . " I had terrible skin , the worst PMS on the planet , I was tired all the time , I had every allergy known to man , and I could barely walk out of the house . I just knew I needed to do something different . I do n't believe I 'd be alive today had I not changed . " That change started with her diet when she was about 20 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I did n't just pick up a book one day , read it and go Oh , vegetarian , here 's a good idea ... ' If s been a journey for me , " says the 59-yearold businesswoman who owns three restaurants in Chicago , two that specialize in raw food entrees and one that focuses on cooked vegan dishes . Vegetarianism , experts say , is not for everyone , but in a society where obesity is reaching epidemic proportions , more and more people want to learn about the quickest and best ways to shed pounds and live healthier lives . Most have found out that living a healthy life requires more than just simply changing your diet and hitting the gym . Nutritionists and fitness experts say your mind-set has to change in order for healthy living to become a way of life . More than 60 percent of Black men over the age of 20 are overweight and more than 70 percent of Black women over the age of 20 are overweight , according to the National Center for Health Statistics . More than 50 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that the biggest increases in the rates of people who are overweight and obese were seen in children , with 17 percent of children being overweight in 2004 .

African-American men have a greater chance of developing or dying from certain diet-related chronic diseases ( heart disease , high blood pressure and diabetes ) than men of other races . Black women have a higher risk of dying from heart disease , high blood pressure and cancer than White women , according to the National Institutes of Health . With such a high percentage of the Black community being impacted by obesity and other dietrelated chronic diseases , doctors say many are not taking effective steps to improve their health . " We want quick fixes , we want liposuction and then the fat comes back over and over again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dayton , Ohio . " And then we have the people who will start exercising in January , and then they expect a quick fix by March . As soon as they get the 10 pounds off , they say , Tm done and I 'll be back again next January , ' ' " she says . It 's that kind of mind-set that gets so many people in trouble with their health , adds Fortson , a South African native who has been an aerobics instructor for almost 20 years . Teaching at several YMCAs in Dayton , she lives , breathes and sleeps fitness , indicated by the fact that when she was pregnant with her daughter , Ruby , she taught fitness classes until the day before her delivery . " I taught my last class on a Friday , my daughter was born on a Saturday and I came back on the following Tuesday and said , " Hey , I 'm here , " and they said " No , take your two weeks off , and we 'll run it exactly the way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practically all of her life , Fortson says she has been serious about her health .

Her " family , " as she calls them , has focused on their fitness for so long because of their mind-set , she insists . Thaf s the key to changing the way you think about fitness and health , she says . " You have to say , " I 'm doing it for me , ' ' " says Fortson .

" Calabrese agrees , believing that your state of mind is key to living a successful , healthy life . " I do n't think if s all about exercise . I do n't think ifs all about food . I think ifs spirituality , food and exercise . I think you need all three , " she says .

While everyone may not become a vegetarian , vegan or raw foodist , it is important to make sensible and healthy food choices .

" On the exercise side of the equation , most health fitness experts recommend that you do 30 or more minutes of moderate physical activity most days of the week . " We do n't always have to go to a health spa , health club or a YMCA to exercise , " says Fortson . " Find a neighborhood group , find your neighbors , find your friends , form your own group and you stick to it because any time there are two people , your chances of sticking with it is higher than if you do it by yourself .
