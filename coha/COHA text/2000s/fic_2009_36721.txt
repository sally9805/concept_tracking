The difference between the wrath of God and the wrath of your mother is that eventually , God forgives you . <p> one <p> The only smell better than Lulu Guinness perfume is eau d ' new car . I breathed in a long , slow , steady stream of the leathery scent as I steered my brand-new BMW 330Ci off the Brauman Motorcars lot . My was a bit of an exaggeration . Technically , the lovely new car belonged to BMW Leasing Corporation , but that was a minor detail . One I was happy to ignore as I weaved through the late morning traffic on Okeechobee Boulevard . <p> The timing was perfect . The cherry red car was exactly what I needed to lift my spirits . I was in a funk after the whole Patrick breakup disaster , so when the dealer called me yesterday , I did n't waste any time arranging to take next-day delivery . <p> Like everything in life  --  a little bad came with the good . Though my previous car was totaled through no fault on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred of my own dollars on the new lease . Luckily , I had cash in the bank . Less than a week ago , I deposited a big check . But not before I scanned it , saved it , and turned the image into a self-congratulatory screen saver on my home and office computers . Hey  --  it 's not like the law firm of Dane , Lieberman , and Zarnowski cuts a check payable to me in that amount every day . No , this was a freak occurrence . A signing bonus of sorts . Or , as I like to think of it , twelve thousand ways for my boss to announce to the world that Finley Anderson Tanner is a valuable asset to the Palm Beach legal community . <p> The check represented the negotiated dollar amount it had cost Vain Victor Dane , Esquire and Asshole Extraordinaire , to make amends for firing me . My shoulder muscles pinched at the mere thought of my employment lord and master . Do n't get me wrong , I like my job at Dane , Lieberman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit strong . As an estates and trusts paralegal , I get to do a variety of different things , which makes it mildly interesting . What makes it a great deal more enjoyable is that I have the autonomy to come and go almost as I please . <p> I " please " a lot . <p> The very nature of my job requires me to be out of the office often . Is it a crime if I happen to take the occasional detour into Nordy 's on the way back ? No . The real crime would be missing out on a sale for the sole reason that I was chained to my desk . It 's a nice desk , by the way . At least it is now . In the last year , I 've done pretty well in the struggle up the corporate ladder department . Well , if you overlook the arrested , jailed , hospitalized , almost killed , and fired  --  twice  --  bumps in my career path . None of those things was my fault . Mostly they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't my fault . <p> Turns out , I have a knack for ferreting out murderers . Okay , so knack might be a bit of an overstatement ; it 's more along the lines of ... " there but for the grace of God I did n't end up dead . " But you get the gist . <p> Multitasking , I eased onto I-95 north while simultaneously skipping through the newest playlist I 'd created for my iPod . It was my iPod too , as of the fifteenth of the month , when I made the last payment . So budgeting is n't my strength , but I have found ways to cut corners . Secret ways . Hopefully they 'll remain secret . Not even my closest friends know that my precarious financial situation has forced me into the underground world of outlet shopping . My wardrobe is a testament to factory damage and slightly irregular . <p> I tensed as I steered onto Blue Heron Boulevard in record time . I was on my way to Iron Horse Country Club . It 's a small , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entrances and manned security gates dotting Palm Beach County . Most people are invited to lunch with their mothers . Not me ; I get summoned . On elegant stationery , no less . I could easily picture my mother in her penthouse , seated at her expensive French desk , gold pen in her perfectly manicured hand . <p> I 'd dressed carefully for my command performance . I 'd chosen a vintage suit in mint green that I 'd found at a church thrift store . Not any church sale , mind you , but the semiannual sale at Bethesdaby-the-Sea , the church in Palm Beach where the rich and famous worshipped . The pale color accentuated the fleck of green in my otherwise blue eyes and my pay-for-it-later tan . I 'd added a white BCBG cami with mint trim . I 'd slipped on a pair of white Steve Madden wedges I 'd picked up at a cool 70 percent off , thanks to a small smudge on the patent leather on the side of the left shoe . Since this was lunch at a country club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green  --  the color she prefers  --  but I also had to do the required hair thing . I was prepared . I had a mother-of-pearl clip at the ready . <p> My mother 's membership at Iron Horse was part of the spoils from one of her divorces . Clicking my fingernail against the walnut-grained steering wheel , I tried to recall which husband had been the avid golfer . As I drove under a canopy of banyan branches , I inhaled the crisp , summery scent of freshly mowed grass filtering in through the vents . For some reason , the homey smell reminded me of the only man my mother had married for true love . Thinking about Jonathan Tanner caused my heart to twist inside my chest . He died almost fifteen years ago and I still miss him . I was two when he adopted me , and I could n't have asked for a better father . I loved him and he loved me . Which probably explains why I do n't have daddy issues . <p> Amazing considering I was a teenager when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My mother had always told me that Finley and Anderson were family names . That part was true . What she 'd neglected to explain was that they were the family names of the two men she 'd been sleeping with when she 'd gotten pregnant with me . As far as I know , neither man ever knew about me . And I have no burning desire to go on some sperm donator search . <p> I considered it once . I was online , killing time before swooping in on a last-minute eBay auction for some links for my build-it-from-scratch Rolex project , when a pop-up ad flashed , promising to find anyone anywhere in twenty-four hours or less . I thought about it for a nanosecond , then decided I truly did n't want to know . <p> I did , however , want those gold links , but I was outbid at the very end of the auction by someone with the screen name JulesJewels . <p> I pulled up in the horseshoe-shaped drive in front of the massive , pillared building . I grabbed my purse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the valet , a kid barely old enough to drive . Then I sprinted up the front steps . <p> Luckily for me , The Clubhouse was a completely inappropriate name for the large , lavish , two-story building . The first floor included a gym , a spa , locker rooms , steam rooms , a lap pool , showers , and twenty-four-hour a day attendants . Upstairs , there was a long polished bar and two dining rooms . <p> Thankfully , the ladies ' room was on the way to the restaurant , giving me an opportunity to slip in and twist my hair into a subdued style that would not inspire my mother 's ire . I paid a lot of money to highlight my blond hair . It seemed like a waste to hide it , but the alternative made me decide to be wasteful . <p> With my hair secured , I smiled briefly at the mute attendant standing in the corner . It seemed to startle her , possibly because the snobbish members treated her as if she 'd been invisible . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plush carpet , past the sparsely populated bar toward the restaurant . The seven or eight men at the bar were dressed in the horrid ensembles golfers tended to fancy . Guess no one told them that no man looked good in plaid pants and an Easter-egg-colored shirt . <p> As I approached the maitre d ' of the less formal dining room where lunch was served , I could smell the sumptuous scents of various foods . My stomach went from clenched to growling in record time . The dining room was huge , with floor-to-ceiling windows overlooking the golf course . The table settings , like the window treatments , reinforced the Iron Horse train theme . The maitre d ' knew me on sight and simply said , " Welcome back , Miss Tanner . Please follow me . " <p> My mother looked up instantly and shot me a disapproving glance . I took my seat , then a waiter appeared and flipped my napkin onto my lap . <p> I took the menu he handed to me , and he offered to give me a minute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new dress ? " I try , I really do . But cracking through the cement of my mother 's emotions is like adding another face to Mount Rushmore using nothing but a dull spoon . <p> Thanks to good genes , regular Restylane , and minor plastic surgery , my mother was a fifty-year-old with the face of a thirtyfive-year-old . To her credit , she worked out with a personal trainer when she was in town , maintaining her size 2 body . Since the average age of the other people in the dining room was somewhere between sixty and ninety , she stood out from the crowd . <p> She would have anyway . My mother was a striking brunette who carried herself like the budding star she 'd once been . All that training had n't gone to waste . Her regal persona had easily evolved from opera diva to country club diva . Other than eye color , my mother and I did n't share much in the looks department . Or the temperament department . Or , well , any department . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't know why I bother to make the effort to always arrive on time when you 're invariably late , Finley . " <p> In less than five seconds , she 'd fired the first shot . This did not bode well for me . " I do n't know either , " I replied . I was n't being facetious . I had no idea why she did n't just show up fifteen minutes later than whatever time she told me . We 'd arrive at sort of the same time , and everyone would be happy . <p> The hovering waiter returned at the subtle wave of my mother 's hand . " What are the specials ? " she demanded . <p> The guy rattled off the specials . Which , by the way , were always the same on Thursdays . And why she asked I have no idea . Regardless of the specials , she always ordered the same thing . <p> " You had me at deep fried , " I smiled at the waiter and added , " I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extra mango relish , with French fries , please . " <p> My mother snapped her menu closed , glaring at me as she ordered a small chef salad , no egg , no cheese , no ham , no dressing . <p> No fun . <p> " Finley , " she whispered in that disapproving tone she considered reasonable just as soon as the waiter was out of earshot . " Keep eating like that and you 'll be as big as a house . How much weight have you put on in the last two months ? Ten ? Fifteen pounds ? " <p> " Four , " I said , struggling not to grit my teeth . " Ninety-six more and I 'll be eligible for gastric bypass . " <p> Arching one perfectly shaped brow disapprovingly , my mother shifted against the back of the richly upholstered chair . Discreetly , she glanced around the dining room , husbandseeking radar on full alert . <p> Not for me , of course . In my mother 's eyes , I was a lost cause , twenty-nine going on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband number six . She 'd been seeing a doctor for a couple of months , but she liked to hedge her bets . <p> " Do n't be flippant , Finley . Your sister 's wedding is just weeks away , and how will it look if you eat yourself out of your maidof-honor dress ? " <p> " I 'm a size six , Mom . Hardly Jabba the Hut . " <p> " Lisa is a size two . I 'm constantly puzzled as to why a woman whose prospects of marriage are diminishing rapidly would n't make every effort to look her best . To be honest , Finley , you 've let yourself go . And what 's this I hear about you not bringing Patrick ? You ca n't attend the wedding without an escort . What will the St. Johns think of us ? What exactly did you do to drive him away ? " <p> As usual when I 'm with my mother , I have fascinating and quick internal comebacks . But I 'm not dumb enough to say them aloud or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The facts would n't matter . Not with my mother . She 'd simply accuse me of being at fault , commitment-phobic , irresponsible  --  take your pick  --  then send Patrick some sort of fruit basket to apologize for my poor behavior . <p> Absently , I flipped the butter knife back and forth against the crisp linen tablecloth . " We decided to see other people . " Partially true . <p> When Cassidy Presley Tanner Halpern Rossi Browning Johnstone , former rising star of the Metropolitan Opera , got curious , she was like the proverbial dog with a bone . " That 's ridiculous . The only time people say that is when they already have another person to see . Is that it ? Did you cheat on Patrick ? " She put her hand on her throat . " Oh , Finley , tell me you did n't cheat on him with that rental cop . " <p> That " rental cop " was Liam McGarrity . Tall , dark , yummy , **31;436;TOOLONG Liam McGarrity . " He 's a private detective , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He might as well be , " she argued . " You 've gotten into quite a few mishaps thanks to that man . " <p> I really wanted to stick a fork in my eye . Thank God our lunch was arriving and I could eat instead of resorting to selfmutilation . " I solved two murder cases , " I reminded her , quite proud of myself , even if she was n't . <p> " Which you have no business doing , " she said as she picked up her fork . " If you really wanted to do some good , you 'd have gone on to law school and worked within the system . Look at your sister . You do n't see Lisa getting mixed up with uneducated riffraff . " <p> I love my sister . I really do . If only she weighed three hundred pounds , screwed up once in a while , and sat around watching TV all day while eating bonbons . Then I 'd love her even more . I could n't compete with my sister on any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She 's a pediatric oncologist , Mom . I do n't think there 's a lot of riffraff in peds intensive care . " <p> " Do n't take that tone with me , " she warned . " Not when I 'm about to do you a generous favor . " <p> My definition of a favor and my mother 's definition of a favor were completely different animals . In fact , I had no doubt that if asked , my mother would claim that commenting on my weight was an amazing act of kindness . As were her constant taunts about my failure to measure up in comparison to my sister . Lisa is my younger sister . She is faultless to a fault  --  if that 's even possible . She 's a successful doctor who 's about to marry into one of Atlanta 's wealthiest families . Hell , by the time she 's thirty , Lisa will have discovered a cure for cancer and donated her findings for the betterment of all mankind . Me ? My life has been reduced to surfing eBay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an estates and trusts paralegal serves its purpose . I make enough money to pay rent , the minimum balances on my credit cards , and make my car payments . I got fired while investigating the Paolo Martinez murder , but since my invo vement brought some heavy-hitting clients to the firm , Vain Victor Dane had no choice but to rehire me . I did n't go cheap , either . I negotiated a twelve-thousand-dollar bonus for myself , and , with luck , my credit application at Barton 's jewelers will be approved and I 'll soon be the proud owner of a ladies ' pink oyster face Datejust Rolex . The watch retails for thirteen-eight , so I 'll only need a two-thousand in-store credit to swing it . I 'll miss the hunt for parts on eBay , but I 'll have the watch of my dreams . Guess once I have it I 'll have to find another hobby . <p> " Finley ! " <p> " Sorry , " I muttered , leaning back so the server could put my second course in front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one bite of my fried shrimp when I noticed my mother 's fork still hovering above her untouched salad . I did a little mental calculation : napkin in lap  --  check . Fork in correct hand  --  check . Feet crossed at the ankles  --  check . I met her gaze . " Is something the matter ? " <p> " Are n't you going to ask me why I invited you to lunch on a Thursday ? " <p> If my memory served me correctly , it was n't exactly an invitation . But I knew nothing would be gained by pointing that out . " Sure . Why did you need to see me today ? " <p> Reaching into the large Chanel tote tucked next to her chair , my mother produced a neatly folded , multipage document with a pale blue cover . Dramatically , she laid it on the table , then slowly slid it in my direction with the tips of two manicured fingers . <p> Resting my fork on the edge of my plate , I took the papers , unfolded them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I read the caption : contract for purchase . Scanning the first paragraph , I blinked twice , then read the words again . " You 're selling me a house ? " <p> " Yes . It 's a property Jonathan and I owned . It was his wish that you have it . " <p> " He died fifteen years ago , " I said . If it was Jonathan 's wish for me to have it , I asked myself , still a little stunned , why was my mother making me buy it ? <p> " Yes , and I have been waiting for you to show some responsibility before giving the property to you . " <p> " This is n't a gift , " I said as I read the terms . " You 're selling it to me . " <p> " People rarely appreciate what they get for free . I 'm transferring the house to you at well below the appraised value , " she pointed out . " The lot alone is worth a fortune . I 'm selling it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't given to random acts of kindness . There had to be a catch . " I do n't have twenty-five thousand dollars . " <p> " How much do you have ? " <p> In the bank or in outstanding loans ? Admitting to the former would be less painful . " I 've got twe-ten thousand dollars saved . " Close enough to true . I 'd gotten my bonus check on Monday , and other than the car lease , I had n't spent a penny of it in four days . That was saving . Kinda . <p> " You can give me that as a down payment , and I 'll hold a mortgage for the other fifteen . " <p> " Why ? " <p> " Why what ? " she asked as she elegantly lifted a fork full of lettuce to her lips . <p> " If you 've had this property for years , why sell it to me now , and why offer to let me make payments for the outstanding fifteen thousand ? " <p> My mother 's face pinched with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Botoxed pinched . " Most homeowners carry a mortgage , Finley . It 's far better than paying rent . In the end , you will have something to show for all those monthly payments . " <p> The tiny hairs on the back of my neck prickled as I read the address . " The house is on Palm Beach . Nothing there costs twenty-five thousand dollars . " <p> " The house might need a little work . There is some hurricane damage . " <p> I looked up and met her gaze . " How much hurricane damage ? " <p> " I 'm hardly a contractor , Finley . " <p> " If I give you all my cash , how am I supposed to fix hurricane damage ? Or pay the taxes ? Or the insurance ? " <p> " If you do n't want it ... " Her voice trailed off . <p> " Of course I want it . I 'm just a little confused . What 's the catch ? " <p> She shrugged slightly . " No catch . Well , except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I quickly turned to that section . " If I ever want to sell the property I can only sell it back to you for the original purchase price ? " <p> " It has sentimental value . It was the first piece of property Jonathan bought when he came to Florida . Oh , " she added , smoothing a lock of chestnut-colored hair off her chemically wrinkle-free forehead . " And paragraph twelve . " <p> Reading further , I discovered that in the event I sold the house back to my mother , I 'd forfeit any money paid to her , as well as a one-time assessment of 5 percent of the appraised value of the home . " So , worst-case scenario , if I decided I did n't want the house , I 'd lose my ten-thousand-dollar deposit plus whatever mortgage payments I made plus another however much for the assessment ? " <p> She shook her head . " Conservatively , we 'd be talking about an additional fifty to one hundred thousand . But that would only be an issue if you reneged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or  --  " <p> " Or what ? " <p> " Or if I die first . Obviously , the house would be yours free and clear in the event of my death . That 's in paragraph seventeen . " <p> This is the point in the conversation when I 'm supposed to cry , " No , Mom , do n't die ! " but the best I could muster was a slight tilt of my head . Thank God this conversation was n't being taped . No court in the land would acquit me if she suddenly croaked . I did n't want her to die , but I did want to know what was behind this unexpected show of generosity . " I 'll have one of the attorneys look at this when  --  " <p> " I 'm afraid I need your decision now . " <p> I blinked . " Right now ? Why ? " <p> " The house has been vacant for about six months . " <p> " Vacant ? Who was living there ? " <p> " Do you remember Melinda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> My mother nodded . " She rented the house after she had her epiphany . " <p> " What epiphany ? " <p> " Fifteen years ago Melinda decided to get out of advertising and devote herself to children . Can you imagine ? " <p> Yes , Mom . Some people actually like their children and do n't see them as disappointing burdens . " That 's quite a change . " <p> Sighing heavily , she said , " Melinda paid more attention to those children than she did to caring for the home . I had no choice but to ask her to leave . " <p> " You evicted a foster mother ? " <p> She nodded . " Yes . Which has created this opportunity for you , Finley . And a responsibility . Given the fact that you just tossed aside your future with Patrick , I need you to demonstrate that you 're capable of taking on responsibility . Of making important decisions . " <p> " This is an important decision , " I agreed , wishing I 'd ordered something a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't jump into without thinking about it . " <p> " What is there to think about ? " she countered . " I 'm offering to sell you a home in a prime location on the beach at a fraction of its fair market value . I 've already spoken to your bank , and they 'll give you a home equity loan for any repairs with the house as collateral . In the event you fail to meet your obligations , I 've agreed to guarantee the loan . All you have to do is sign some papers at the bank . I 've arranged for a line of credit up to two hundred thousand dollars . I will cover the taxes and insurance until you pay off the fifteen thousand dollars you owe me . That payment is set at two hundred fifty dollars per month . Since I have a long-standing relationship with the bank , if you borrow the maximum amount I 've guaranteed , you 're looking at a combined monthly payment of about seventeen hundred . How much is your rent ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said smugly . " For two hundred dollars a month , you 're actually working toward owning a sizeable asset . " <p> I felt a vine-covered pit opening beneath my feet . I smelled my own fear . My mother never gave anything without weighing her options . If it was good for my mother , it was bad for me . I knew that . It was a given . But , damn . The offer sounded so tempting . I could find two hundred extra dollars a month . Right ? <p> A homeowner . A house right on the beach . The payments sounded doable . The sell-back terms sucked , but if I took her up on her offer , I would n't want to sell the house back to her . <p> Run away , I told myself . " I-I know . " <p> " I 'm your mother , Finley . Are you insinuating you ca n't or wo n't trust me ? " <p> Yes . " No , of course not . But I 'd like to have Becky take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contracts attorney at Dane , Lieberman , and Zarnowski and one of my best friends . <p> " I want this resolved now , Finley . Accept my generous offer , or do n't . Make up your own mind . " <p> Oh , boy . " Okay . Where do I sign ? " Becky did n't trust my mother any more than I did . And she was n't going to be happy that I 'd contractually bound myself to buying a house without her going over the contract with a lice comb first . <p> " Then let 's get Julianna over here . " My mother raised her hand in the direction of the maitre d ' . <p> " Who 's Julianna ? " <p> " She works here at the club . She 's a notary . Philippe can be a witness . " <p> I heard the sound of a train barreling over me , and my mind flashed an image of my body flattened on imaginary tracks . I 'd come to Iron Horse Country Club for a simple lunch , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and writing a check . <p> An hour later , still dazed , I walked into the lobby of Dane , Lieberman , and Zarnowski . Margaret Ford was planted behind the horseshoe-shaped mahogany reception desk , Bluetooth tucked behind her right ear . She glanced over at me , then made a production out of checking her watch . Yeah , yeah , like I needed her snarky expression to tell me I was twenty-seven minutes late getting back from lunch . <p> " Messages ? " I asked . <p> " No . " <p> I turned and headed for the elevator . Other than arranging for a site appraisal on the Melanie Dryer estate , my afternoon was pretty light . By the time I reached my office on the second floor , I was dying to get a look at the house I 'd just bought . <p> The faint scent of lavender from a plug-in air freshener mingled with the strong aroma of coffee . After dropping my purse in a desk drawer , I filled my mug with the dregs from the carafe and navigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was still having a hard time wrapping my brain around the idea that I was the owner of a home on Palm Beach . <p> My fingernail tapped impatiently on the arrow key , annoyed that the satellite photo was so fuzzy . All I could really make out was a basic outline . The roof of my house was approximately one-tenth the size of the garage on the neighboring property to the left . And smaller than the pool of the house to the right . <p> So what . It was right on the beach , and it was mine . Well , mostly mine . <p> As much as I wanted to race out and see the house , I decided it should be a celebration . And who better to share my newfound land-baron status with than my nearest and dearest ? I emailed Becky , Liv , and Jane , sure that if I called them I 'd spill my guts and spoil the surprise . In less than five minutes , I had confirmations from all three . <p> I called the appraiser , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My friend and neighbor , Sam Carter , is an interior designer , and he would probably cut off my fingers if he knew I was picking colors and furnishings unsupervised . His disdain would n't be wholly unwarranted . The dTcor in my apartment lingers somewhere between yard sale and college dorm . Sam was at some home show in Vegas , but I was sure that once he saw the house , he 'd have strong opinions . <p> Hell , I wanted to see the house . Glancing at my Kuber watch , I pressed my lips together . It was only a few minutes after three . Drumming my fingers on my desk , I glanced at my open case files , deciding which one I could use to my best advantage . There was no way I could get past surly Margaret and her file room flunkies without a viable excuse . <p> Margaret 's been stationed at that desk for twenty-five years  --  probably one of the things that 's made her so bitter . That and she resents the fact that I make more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn the big bucks and the rest of us should be paid according to seniority . Coincidentally , that would make her the highest paid non-attorney member of the staff . But I was the one with the degree . And I was the one who 'd just brought five new clients to the firm . As far as I was concerned , she could go suck her Bluetooth . <p> With a draft of the Jessup estate accounting tucked into the pink alligator leather tote I bought as a consolation gift after my last confrontation with Patrick , I scooted my chair back , clicking the button on the wireless mouse to hibernate my computer , and made a stealthy exit . <p> " This is yours , Finley ? " <p> It was hard to hear Becky Jameson 's voice over the excited thudding of my heart in my ears as I closed the car door . The magnitude of this moment made it hard for me to remember how to breathe normally . <p> The idea that I was a homeowner before I hit the big three-o qualified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My new abode was a darling cottage on the north end of Palm Beach . The Palm Beach . <p> " Yep , " I said as I hoisted my tote and purse higher on my shoulder . <p> Becky lingered by the car , whistling softly as she gave the exterior a once-over . " What 's the catch ? " <p> I believe those were my exact words . <p> Becky 's tone echoed the uneasiness knotted in my stomach . We 'd been friends since college , so like me , she was stunned when I told her that my mother had sold me the house for a fraction of its value . " The contract she had me sign was really straightforward , " I insisted . I had the five-page document tucked inside my tote . <p> I focused , transfixed , on the tidy turquoise cottage with a small front porch and coral accents that , as of a few hours ago , was my new address . Like Weezie Jefferson , I 'd moved on up . The Palm Beach address was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under normal circumstances , it was also far beyond my meager means . <p> Becky slipped her sunglasses down on the bridge of her perfect nose and gave me one of those " I 'll bet " looks . She was a little miffed that I 'd made my first real estate transaction without so much as calling her for advice . <p> Which I would have done if my mother had n't put a ticking clock on the transaction . <p> " Are we going in ? " Becky asked as she moved around the front of her car toward the house . <p> " We have to wait for Liv and Jane . " <p> Becky lifted her auburn hair off her neck and twisted it into a messy knot . " Great . You get a house and I get heat stroke . " <p> " Let 's walk around back , " I suggested . <p> The small yard circling the building was landscaped , and the grass was freshly mowed . A small , uneven stone pathway led around the side of the single-story home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rimmed the house . Hopefully that someone would keep it up , since I have the blackest thumb in all of south Florida . I did n't make eye contact with the plants , afraid they 'd pick up on my botanical death ray and die on the spot . <p> Other than a cement slab , the backyard was nothing more than a glorious slope of sand leading straight into the Atlantic Ocean . The surf lapped softly on the deserted shoreline , sending a cooling , salty breeze to greet us . I slipped off my shoes and felt the cool , fine-grained sand beneath my feet . Besides a few clumps of sea grass , nothing impeded my glorious view . On either side of my beach  --  I paused to repeat that in my head : my beach  --  the neighbors had privacy fences with some sort of vines growing over them for aesthetic purposes . I did n't care ; the small red flowers perfumed the air , enhancing the whole experience . <p> " This is my sand , " I said as I wiggled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand belongs to the state , " Becky remarked , hooking the straps of her wedges over one finger . <p> Unlike me , Becky did n't have to resort to online auctionsand outlet shopping . Thanks to her JD , she earned a decent salary . " Want a roommate ? This view is incredible , " Becky sighed . " This place has to be worth a few million , easy . " <p> True . It was one of the few prime beach-front cottages still standing . Most of the small lots in Palm Beach had been gobbled up by developers . Cottages like mine  --  I got a rush just hearing that thought in my brain  --  were practically extinct . <p> " You could flip this place and  --  " <p> " No , I ca n't , " I explained . " That was one of the provisions my mother put into the contract . " <p> " You ca n't sell it ? " <p> I shrugged . " I can , but only back to her . Apparently she has a deep emotional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had the same tenant for most of the past fifteen years , but six months ago , Melinda left . It 's been vacant ever since . " <p> " Melinda ? You knew the tenant ? " <p> " Kinda , " I said , shading my eyes as the sun behind me painted the surf gold . " She was Jonathan 's assistant in New York and then somehow went from that to fostering kids . My mother did n't give me the details , just that she evicted her . " <p> " That 's cold , " Becky remarked without surprise . " Where is your mother now ? " <p> I turned and looked at my friend . " How should I know ? And what difference does it make ? " <p> " None , I guess . But I 'm having a hard time with the notion that your mother just had you write a check and handed you the keys ? No warning , no nothing ? " <p> I shrugged . " A random act of kindness . Who cares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a beautiful , three-bedroom oceanfront house . " <p> " What other restrictions did she put on the sale ? " <p> I waved my hand dismissively . " Just general stuff about maintaining it properly , blah , blah , blah . Oh , and "  --  I lowered my voice , hoping it would drown in the sound of the waves  --  " I ca n't borrow against it for anything other than maintenance and repairs . " <p> Becky shook her head . " She dangled the bait and you impaled yourself on the hook . " <p> " Look around you , " I said . " I could work for the next gazillion years and I 'd never be able to afford this place . " <p> " Can you afford the taxes and the insurance ? " Becky countered . <p> " I do n't have to until I 've paid off fifteen thousand I owe my mother . Can you go pull the wings off a different butterfly ? " <p> Becky raised her hands in surrender . " You 're right , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm sorry for pissing on it . " <p> We started back toward the house . " How much do you think a total face-lift will cost ? " I asked . <p> " How much have you earned in the past nine years ? " <p> " You 're still pissing . " <p> " Sorry . " <p> Olivia Garrett and Jane Spencer were walking up the pressed concrete driveway as we came around the house . Liv was balancing a champagne bottle and a picnic basket . Jane raced toward me , grabbing me in a tight hug that lifted me off the ground . Jane 's very athletic . In fact , we met at the gym . We pretended to be friends so we could take advantage of the two-for-one special . The friendship had lasted . The gym membership , at least for me , had been a one-visit thing . <p> Jane is an accountant who looks more like one of the Pussycat Dolls . Her hair is long and dark . Her smile is brilliant , and she has a body that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Liv owns an event planning business with her partner , Jean-Claude . She 's as smart as she is beautiful . There 's something exotic about her features that makes men literally stop dead in their tracks . If I were a lesbian , I 'd definitely go for Liv . <p> Spreading my arms , I said , " Welcome to Chez Tanner . " <p> " Oh my God ! " Liv gushed . <p> " It 's perfect ! " Jane practically squealed before covering her mouth with her hands . " I hear the ocean . I 'm so jealous , I hate you , " she added , and then she looped her hand through my arm . " Finley , this is so great . " <p> As we walked to the front door , I felt my pulse quicken again . I fumbled inside my purse , feeling for the loose key I 'd carefully tucked into the side pocket . My hand was actually shaking as I inserted the key , then I heard the unmistakable click of the dead bolt sliding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy teak door , I was slapped in the face with the foulest odor in the history of stench . <p> " What is that smell ? " Becky gagged . <p> The alarm chirped seven times before I pressed the code to disarm it . Not an easy task , given the fact that my eyes were burning from the rancid fumes and I suddenly realized that my bare feet were wet . Looking down , I realized that I was standing on moldy , squishy carpet that was foaming as if having some sort of convulsion . <p> From the outside , the cottage looked fairly pristine . The inside looked like a scene straight out of Extreme Makeover Home Edition . Exposed wiring hung from the ceiling . Not a light fixture to be seen . Probably a good thing , since the standing water would have conducted current and we all would have been electrocuted . <p> I wondered if my mother had actually evicted Melinda or if she 'd left of her own volition . Probably the latter . The house looked as if nothing but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back-to-back-to-back hurricanes had slammed into Palm Beach . <p> " What is that ? " Liv asked through her fingers , pointing at the wall . <p> Some sort of brown gunk dripped from the bowed ceiling until it met a furry patch of black mold leeching up from the mildewed carpet . <p> " It 's alive , " Becky mocked in a horror flick impression . " I ca n't believe a tenant put up with this . " <p> Neither could I. Bravely , I walked through the living room toward double glass doors . My fingernail polish chipped as I battled the latch to unlock , then push open , the door . Blissfully , fresh air whooshed though the house , allowing us to stop using our hands as protective masks . <p> Sucking in a deep breath , I turned to see that I was standing in the center of a breakfast nook . I was no expert , but I was fairly sure the grout between the ceramic tiles covering the floor was n't supposed to be black . Nor was the kitchen counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot like the San Andreas Fault . A grimy square outline marked where a stove had once been connected . Three of the cabinet doors were missing , as was the refrigerator . <p> Liv said , " Who would let a piece of primo real estate like this go to hell in a hand cart ? Sorry , Finley , but this is a dump . " <p> " A dump smells better . " Becky 's voice was muffled by the hand she still had clamped over her nose and mouth . <p> " The mold might be toxic , " Jane suggested somberly . <p> Crying seemed like a good idea . " I hope it kills me quickly , " I said , hating that my voice cracked . <p> " Hang on , " Becky said , coming over to put an arm around my shoulder . " It 's still a beautiful location . It just needs some TLC . " <p> " Are you on LSD ? " I asked . " The whole place has to be gutted . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few times , my mind in hyperdrive . She was absolutely right . I started looking around . Really looking . If I started from scratch , I could turn the place into my dream house . <p> " I could make this whole back wall doors and glass , " I said , excitement budding in my stomach . " A sleek kitchen with a wine chiller . " <p> " You 'll need a lot of wine to forget about the mold , " Jane said . " How could anyone live here ? " <p> I shot her a stern look . " I do n't know , but I guess that 's why my mother arranged for my bank to give me a home equity loan for repairs . I knew there was a catch . I feel like a fool . " <p> " Do n't , " Becky said . " Look on the bright side . The place has potential . Forget the mold for now . " <p> " You 're right . I can get rid of the skanky carpet . Hardwood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and purse on the counter , I went off to explore . <p> My friends followed along , crouched behind me so that we looked like the Tin Man , the Lion , and the Scarecrow on their way to see the great and powerful Oz . There was a small powder room off the hallway . The toilet bowl and sink were missing . " At least I wo n't have to pay to have them removed , " I said , thinking aloud . Farther down the hall I found two small bedrooms opposite one another . There was another bathroom , sans shower stall . The master bedroom was at the end of the hall . <p> " It 's small , " Liv said . " How many foster children lived here at one time ? " <p> " No clue , " I answered absently . " I can take down this wall , " I suggested . " Combine the master bedroom and one of the other ones . I can build a killer closet and maybe do a spa bath . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As soon as she touched the scratched knob , the door fell off its tracks . The closet was narrow , and the rod was missing . She laid the cheap door on the floor , stepped over it , and walked into the adjoining bathroom . <p> Coming up behind her , I placed my hand on her hip and moved her to one side . It looked like something you 'd find in a youth hostel . Tiny tub , sink affixed to the wall . Mirror hanging above the chipped sink and a toilet sandwiched in between . There was a narrow rectangular window mounted in the shower stall near the ceiling line . Judging by the blistering of the plaster , I was already resigned to the fact that it leaked . <p> " So , " I said as I rejoined Liv and Jane in the bedroom . " I guess I 'll need a Home Depot credit card . " <p> " No , " Jane scoffed . " You need an Extreme Home Makeover . " Her green eyes glinted mischievously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ty Pennington . Deal ? " <p> " I get Ty ! " Jane called as she headed back toward the smaller bedrooms . <p> " Was that champagne you brought ? " I asked Liv . <p> She nodded . " And some fruit and cheese . I did n't bring an ice bucket because I thought  --  " <p> " C'm on , " I interrupted , leading Jane and Liv back down toxic alley to the kitchen . " You coming ? " I called to Becky as we passed the smallest bedroom . <p> " Be right there . " <p> So what if my new house was uninhabitable ? It did n't have to stay that way . I had my apartment , so it was n't as if I 'd have to sleep in moldville . " Sam will help . " <p> " We 'll all help . " Liv started gathering up the picnic basket , and I grabbed the champagne . " Jane , run out to my trunk and grab the blanket . We can have drinks on the beach . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mush , muttering curses as she went . <p> I heard a loud bang and yelled , " Becky , what are you doing ? " <p> " Trying to open the frigging closet in here , " she called back . <p> " Leave it . We 're going out to the beach . " <p> " I can make this work , " I told Liv a few minutes later as I twisted the metal net off the top of the champagne bottle . Using the hem of my skirt , I eased the cork loose without losing a single bubble . <p> " Nice , " Liv complimented as Jane arrived and spread the blanket on a level patch of sand . <p> Looking back at the house , I had a zillion ideas running through my head . Okay , so I was discouraged , but I was also excited by the challenge . " I wonder how much it will cost . " <p> " Wo n't be cheap , " Jane said as she held up a flute for me to fill . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't ? " <p> She shook her head . " It 's location , Finley . Since you barely paid anything for the property , whatever you put into this place , you 'll get back at least fifty times over . Palm Beach real estate is a great investment . If this place was built prior to 1929 , I can even help you apply for some tax deferment programs and rehab grants . " <p> " Really ? " <p> " You 'll need a contractor , " Liv said . " Though I 'm all for calling in Ty Pennington . " <p> " I 'll keep that in mind . " <p> " Get a hot contractor , " Jane insisted . " You do n't want some old , fat guy with a bad comb-over and his butt crack showing . " <p> " To Finley 's new status as a land baron . And to hot contractors , " Liv said , raising her glass . <p> " Should n't we wait for Becky ? " <p> " Naw , we 'll just refill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoying the soft tickle of the dry champagne as it washed over my tongue . " The lease on my apartment is n't up for another three months . Think that 's enough time ? " <p> " Probably not . You need to talk to someone who knows construction , " Jane said . " What about Liam ? " <p> " He 's still on my To Be Avoided list . " <p> " I thought what he did was gallant , " Liv sighed , then popped a grape into her mouth . " Any other guy would have screwed your lights out . " <p> I wish . My cheeks felt warm . I 'm not sure whether it was because I was imagining Liam and myself together or remembering that he 'd declined my offer to do just that . " Sam probably knows someone . " <p> " True , but I doubt he knows anyone as hot as Liam McGarrity . " <p> " Sure he does . " <p> Jane shot me a glare as she reached for a wedge of cheese . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her elbows , her gaze fixed on the house . " Are you going to name it ? " <p> " Name what ? " <p> " The house . People on Palm Bach name their houses . You know , Hidden Palms . Restless Waters . Something beachy and pretentious . " <p> " You really think I need to call my house something ? " <p> Becky rushed out and said , " This place is a crime scene . " <p> " It is not . It just needs a redo . " <p> " No , " Becky said in a single , clipped syllable . " I mean it 's an actual crime scene . " <p> " So someone stole the appliances and some of the fixtures . It 's not like  --  " <p> " No , Finley ! Call the police . I just found a dead guy in the closet . " <p> Copyright 2009 by Rhonda Pollero <br> Continues ...
