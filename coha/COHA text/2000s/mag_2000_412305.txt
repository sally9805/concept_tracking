" The challenge in this film was to get them up and move them around and have them be different heights and have them have different postures and walks and have them interact , " he pointed out . This time Sherman 's love interest is Janet Jackson . Jada Pinkett Smith was his girlfriend in the first Nutty Professor movie . Praising Jackson , Murphy said : " I 've known for years that she 's a good actress . I remember watching her on TV in Good Times ' when she was just a little girl . There was some episode where she was this little abused girl and I remember the whole house sitting around crying . Now , she 's a superstar and a really talented woman . Janet is like a superstar . It was like Wow , I 'm with a superstar on the set.m Jackson said the hardest part of working on Nutty Professor II was keeping a straight face . " I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughing actually , " she said . " But , it 's very difficult keeping a straight face with Eddie .

She recalled her mother 's reaction when she told her she 'd be doing the Nutty Professor sequel . " She said , So , are you going to be passing gas around the table like everybody else ? ' And I said , Well , uh , as of right now , I do n't think so . ' That was the first thing out of her mouth . She said , That was so silly . Are you going to be farting around the table ? ' It was very strange . " Even though the movie was fun for her every day , Jackson said it was still challenging to sit and act opposite just a visual effect sometimes since Murphy is all six Klumps . " There 's this giant blue thing with an X on it and that 's supposed to be Buddy Love or Sherman or someone , " she explained . " And you just have to pretend as if you 're acting or looking at that character , connecting in some sort of way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just put an X or a tennis ball at the end of a stand and that is your eyeline and that is who you are speaking to . I 've seen it done by other actors before . But , it 's my first time . " Photograph The sweet scholars enjoy a meal together . Jackson said the hardest part of working on the movie was trying not to laugh in scenes with Murphy . // Murphy said going from one Klump character to another was n't difficult for him at all . " All of this stuff is hard for me if I 'm doing a bad movie and we have a bad script and I 'm working with stupid , a-hole jerk actors , " he said . But we really had a good crew and a really good , talented director ( Peter Segal ) . And I 'm doing the kind of thing that I like to do . " Of all the characters , he said getting made up for Granny Klump took the longest time . " I think she had 12 different pieces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hands . So , you might be in the chair for four or five hours . That 's the one thing that was hard about this movie , the makeup process . It 's just tedious to sit there . " But , the payoff has been huge . Critics have praised Murphy 's ability to seemingly effortlessly move from one Klump character to another . Jackson added : I 've always admired him , but my admiration has gone to another level . He is truly a genius .
