Chapter 3 : Property of the Alacrn Estate Celia left in the morning , and Matt spent the entire day waiting for the children . He had given up hope when , just before sunset , he heard voices approaching through the poppy fields . He planted himself in front of the window and waited . " There he is ! See , Mara , I told you I was n't lying , " cried Emilia . Her hand rested on the shoulder of a much smaller girl . " He wo n't talk to us , but you 're about his age . Maybe he wo n't be afraid of you . " Emilia pushed the girl ahead of her and fell back to wait with Steven . Mara was n't at all shy about coming up to the window . " Hey , boy ! " she yelled , rapping the glass with her fist . " What 's your name ? Do you want to play ? " With one blow , she stole Matt 's carefully prepared speech . He stared at her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it yes or no ? " Mara turned toward the others . " Make him unlock the door . " " That 's up to him , " said Steven . Matt wanted to say he did n't have the key , but he was unable to get the words out . " At least he is n't hiding today , " remarked Emilia . " If you ca n't unlock the door , open the window , " Mara said . Matt tried , knowing it would n't work . Celia had nailed the window shut . He threw up his hands . " He understands what we say , " said Steven . " Hey , boy ! If you do n't do something quick , we 're going away , " Mara shouted . Matt thought desperately . He needed something to interest them . He held up his finger , as Celia did when she wanted him to wait . He nodded his head to show that he agreed with Mara 's demand and was about to do something . " What does that mean ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a mute and ca n't talk , " Steven guessed . Matt raced to his bedroom . He ripped the picture of the man with the bullfrog sandwich from the wall . It made Celia laugh . Maybe it would make these children laugh . He ran back and pressed the newspaper against the window . The three children came close to study it . " What 's it say ? " asked Mara . " ' Ribbit on Rye , ' " read Steven . " Do you get it ? It 's a bullfrog going ribbit , ribbit , ribbit , and it 's between two slices of rye bread . That 's pretty funny . " Emilia giggled , but Mara looked uncertain . " People do n't eat bullfrogs , " she said . " I mean , not when they 're alive . " " It 's a joke , dum-dum . " " I 'm not a dum-dum ! It 's mean and nasty to eat bullfrogs ! I do n't think it 's funny at all . " " Save me from eejits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not an eejit , either ! " " Oh , lighten up , Mara , " Emilia said . " You brought me out here to see a boy , and it was miles and miles across the fields , and I 'm tired and the boy wo n't talk . I hate you ! " Matt stared at the scene with consternation . That was n't the result he wanted at all . Mara was crying , Emilia looked angry , and Steven had turned his back on both of them . Matt rapped on the window . When Mara looked up , he waved the picture and then wadded it into a ball . He threw it with all his force across the room . " See , he agrees with me , " cried Mara through her tears . " This is getting weirder by the minute , " said Steven . " I knew we should n't have brought the eejit . " " I thought the boy would talk to a kid his own size , " Emilia said . " Come on , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I 'm not walking anywhere ! " The little girl flopped down on the ground . " Well , I wo n't carry you , fatso . " " Just leave her , " said Steven . He started walking off , and after a moment Emilia followed him . Matt was appalled . If the big kids went away , Mara would be all alone . It was going to be dark soon , and Celia would n't return for hours . Mara would be alone with nothing but the empty poppy fields and the ... The chupacabras , who came out after dark and sucked your juices and left you to dry like an old cantaloupe skin ! Suddenly Matt knew what he had to do . Mara had walked a few steps away from the window before sitting down again . She was shouting insults at the vanished Steven and Emilia . Matt grabbed the big iron cooking pot Celia used to make menudo and swung it before he could worry much about her reaction . She would be furious ! But he was saving Mara @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window . It fell in a tinkling , jangling mass to the ground . Mara jumped to her feet . Steven and Emilia rose up instantly from the poppy field , where they 'd been hiding . " Holy frijoles ! " said Steven . All three stood openmouthed , staring at the empty hole where the window had been . " My name is Matt . I live here . Do you want to play ? " said Matt because he could n't think of another thing to say . " He can talk , " said Emilia after the first shock had died away . " Is that how you usually open a window , kid ? " Steven said . " Stay back , Mara . There 's glass all over . " He stepped carefully to the opening and knocked out the remaining shards with a stick . Then he leaned inside to look around . Matt had to hold on to himself to keep from bolting to the other room . " This is creepy ! The window 's nailed shut . What are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Matt said . " You told us that already . " " Do you want to play ? " " Maybe he 's like a parrot and only knows a few words , " suggested Emilia . " I want to play , " said Mara . Matt looked at her with approval . The girl was struggling in Emilia 's arms , obviously trying to get to him . Steven shook his head and moved away . He looked like he was really going to leave this time . Matt came to a decision . It was frightening , but he 'd never had an opportunity like this before and he might never have it again . He shoved a chair to the opening , scrambled up , and jumped . " No ! " shouted Steven , running forward to catch him . He was too late . A terrible pain lanced through Matt 's feet . He fell forward , and his hands and knees landed on the shards of glass . " He was n't wearing shoes ! Oh , man ! Oh , man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled Matt up and swung him onto a clear patch of ground . Matt stared with amazement at the blood dripping from his feet and hands . His knees sprouted rivulets of red . " Pull out the glass ! " cried Emilia in a high , scared voice . " Mara , stay away ! " " I want to see ! " yelled the little girl . Matt heard a slap and Mara 's shriek of outrage . His head was swimming . He wanted to throw up , but before he could , everything went black . He woke to the sensation of being carried . He was sick to his stomach , but worse than that his body was trembling in a frightening way . He screamed as loud as he could . " Great ! " panted Steven , who supported Matt 's shoulders . Emilia had his legs . Her shirt and pants were soaked with blood , his blood . Matt screamed again . " Be quiet ! " Steven shouted . " We 're running as fast as we can ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hills , stretched away in all directions . Steven and Emilia were jogging along a dirt path . Matt 's breath caught with sobs . He could hardly get air . " Stop ! " cried Emilia . " We have to let Mara catch up . " The two children squatted down and let Matt 's weight rest on the ground . Presently , Matt heard the patter of smaller feet . " I want to rest too , " demanded Mara . " It 's miles and miles . I 'm going to tell Dada you slapped me . " " Be my guest , " said Emilia . " Everyone be quiet , " Steven ordered . " You 've stopped bleeding , kid , so I guess you 're not in too much danger . What 's your name again ? " " Matt , " Mara answered for him . " We are n't far from the house , Matt , and you 're in luck . The doctor 's spending the night . Do you hurt a lot ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You screamed , " Mara said . " I do n't know what a lot is , " Matt explained . " I have n't hurt like this before . " " Well , you 've lost blood  --  but not too much , " Steven added as Matt began to tremble again . " It sure looks like a lot , " said Mara . " Shut up , eejit . " The older children rose , carrying Matt between them . Mara followed , complaining loudly about the distance and at being called an eejit . A kind of heavy sleepiness fell over Matt as he was swayed along . The pain had died down , and Steven said he had n't lost too much blood . He was too dazed to worry about what Celia would say when she saw the broken window . They reached the edge of the poppy fields as the last streaks of sunlight slid behind the hills . The dirt path gave way to a wide lawn . It was a shimmering green , growing deeper with the blue light of evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . It 's a meadow , he thought , drowsily . And it smells like rain . They started up a flight of wide , marble steps that shone softly in the darkening air . On either side were orange trees , and all at once lamps went on among the leaves . Lights outlined the white walls of a vast house above , with pillars and statues and doorways going who knew where . In the center of an arch was the carved outline of a scorpion . " Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! Oh ! " came a flurry of women 's voices as they swept down the stairs to lift Matt from Steven 's and Emilia 's arms . " Who is he ? " asked the maids . They were wearing black dresses with white aprons and starched , white caps . One of them , a severe-looking female with deep creases down either side of her mouth , carried Matt as the others went ahead to open doors . " I found him in a house in the poppy fields , " replied Steven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maid said . " She 's too stuck-up to live with the rest of us . " " If she 's hiding a child , I 'm not surprised . Who 's your father , kid ? " said the woman who was carrying Matt . Her apron smelled like sunlight , the way Celia 's did when it came straight from the clothesline . Matt stared at a pin fastened to the woman 's collar , a silver scorpion with its tail curved up . Beneath the scorpion was a name tag that said ROSA . Matt did n't feel well enough to talk , and what did it matter who his father was , anyhow ? He did n't know the answer , either . " He does n't talk much , " said Emilia . " Where 's the doctor ? " Steven said . " We 'll have to wait . He 's treating your grandfather . At least we can clean the kid up , " said Rosa . The maids opened a door to reveal the most beautiful room Matt had ever seen . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hundreds of birds . To Matt 's reeling eyes , they seemed to be moving . He saw a couch upholstered with flowers that shaded from lavender to rose like the feathers on a dove 's wings . It was to this couch that Rosa was carrying him . " I 'm too dirty , " Matt murmured . He had been yelled at before for climbing on Celia 's bed with muddy feet . " You can say that again , " snapped Rosa . The other women opened a crisp , white sheet and laid it over the wonderful couch before Matt was laid down . He thought he could get into just as much trouble for getting blood on that sheet . Rosa fetched a pair of tweezers and began pulling out fragments of glass from his hands and feet . " Ay ! " she murmured as she dropped the bits into a cup . " You 're brave not to cry . " But Matt did n't feel brave at all . He did n't feel anything . His body seemed far away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a TV screen . " He sure screamed earlier , " observed Mara . She was dancing around , trying to see everything that happened . " Do n't act so superior . You yell your head off if you get an itty-bitty splinter in your finger , " Emilia said . " Do not ! " " Do so ! " " I hate you ! " " Ask me if I care , " said Emilia . Both she and Steven watched in fascination as blood began to well out of Matt 's cuts again . " I 'm going to be a doctor when I grow up , " announced Emilia . " This is very good experience for me . " The other maids had brought a bucket of water and towels , but they did n't attempt to clean Matt up until Rosa gave them permission . " Be careful . The right foot is badly cut , " said Rosa . The air hummed in Matt 's ears . He felt the warm water and suddenly the pain returned . It stabbed from his foot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opened his mouth to scream , but nothing came out . His throat had closed with shock . " Oh , God ! There must be glass left inside , " cried Rosa . She grabbed Matt 's shoulders and ordered him not to be afraid . She seemed almost angry . The fogginess that had surrounded Matt had vanished . His feet , his hands , his knees throbbed with more pain than he had known existed . " I told you he was crying earlier , " said Mara . " Be quiet ! " said Emilia . " Look ! There 's writing on his foot , " the little girl cried . She tried to get close , but Emilia thrust her back . " I 'm the one who 's going to be a doctor . Rats ! I ca n't read it . There 's too much blood . " She snatched a washcloth and wiped Matt 's foot . The pain was n't as bad this time , but he could n't help moaning . " You 're hurting him , you bully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just make it out ... ' Property of '  --  the writing is so tiny !  --  ' Property of the Alacrn Estate . ' " " ' Property of the Alacrn Estate ' ? That 's us . It does n't make any sense , " said Steven . " What 's going on ? " came a voice Matt had n't heard before . A large , fierce-looking man burst into the room . Steven immediately straightened up . Emilia and even Mara looked alarmed . " We found a kid in the poppy fields , Father , " said Steven . " He hurt himself , and I thought the doctor ... the doctor  --  " " You idiot ! You need a vet for this little beast ! " the man roared . " How dare you defile this house ? " " He was bleeding  --  " began Steven . " Yes ! All over the sheet ! We 'll have to burn it . Take the creature outside now . " Rosa hesitated , obviously bewildered . The man leaned forward and whispered into her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She instantly scooped up Matt and ran . Steven dashed ahead to open the doors . His face had turned white . " How dare he talk to me like that , " he hissed . " He did n't mean it , " said Emilia , who was dragging Mara along behind . " Oh , yes he did . He hates me , " Steven said . Rosa hurried down the steps and dumped Matt roughly onto the lawn . Without a word , she turned and fled back to the house .
