It has been more than 70 years since a sitting Senator lost an election in Louisiana . It has been almost 120 years since a Republican senatorial candidate in Louisiana won one . Both those streaks are safe  --  for now . On Saturday , Senator Mary Landrieu successfully defended her seat against challenger Suzanne Haik Terrell , by 51% to 49% , in a nasty , narrow runoff election that gives dazed Democrats a silver lining to their dark midterm cloud . <P> As victories go , it was an ugly one . Landrieu came into this race as the favorite . But Louisiana 's idiosyncratic electoral system requires that candidates get 50% of the vote or face a runoff , and on Nov. 5 Landrieu came up just short , with 46% . That opened the door for Terrell , and she charged through it with a parade of Republican heavyweights right behind her : George Bush , Trent Lott and Dick Cheney all stumped for her . Meanwhile , Landrieu scrambled to put distance between herself and her crippled party , pointing out that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both sides seized the low ground with attack ads : Republicans screeched that Landrieu voted for taxpayer-funded abortions , and Democrats chastised Terrell for not opposing Bush 's plan to increase sugar imports from Mexico  --  a bad move in a sugar state like Louisiana . <P> In the end , Landrieu managed to galvanize just enough of her crucial African-American base to break ahead . Her victory leaves the Republicans with a slim majority in the Senate and Democrats with a key lesson . If they 're going to have a chance in 2004 , Democrats will have to crack Bush 's hold on the South . Landrieu just might be able to teach them how .  --  By Lev Grossman
