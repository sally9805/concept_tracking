<p> ORLANDO , Fla. - One youngster was the brain of the operation - Mr. Know-it-all . <p> " Who 's that ? He 's not in a uniform . Is he a player ? " <p> " That 's Darko . No. 2 pick . Gon na be a star . " <p> " Darko , sign this ! Darko , sign this ! " <p> Less than 30 seconds after that conversation , the two pre-adolescent autograph seekers had this exchange . <p> " Who 's that ? Who 's that ? " <p> " Who ? No. 44 ? " <p> " Yeah . " <p> " Do n't know , but we might as well get his autograph anyway . " <p> " Hey , Ebi ! " <p> That 's one of the differences between the two individuals who were walking though the players ' entrance into TD Waterhouse Centre this week for the Pepsi Pro Summer League . Most basketball fans know Darko Milicic , the No. 2 pick in last month 's NBA draft . Few know Ndudi Ebi , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let 's not get into LeBron James , who came through that tunnel 90 minutes after Ebi to find more than a dozen cameras and all eyes focused on him . <p> The youngsters had no trouble recognizing James , who like Ebi is making the difficult jump from high school to the NBA . But months before training camps begin , James , the overall No. 1 pick in the draft , is already a star , a multimillionaire and a starter for the Cleveland Cavaliers . <p> Ebi , a former Westbury Christian standout and the 26th player selected this year , has a long way to go before anyone recognizes him as a star . But Timberwolves executives believe the day will come . <p> And after seeing him practice and play with their summer league squad , they say that day may come sooner than you might think . <p> The general consensus is it 's going to take time . Ebi says he will be patient but admits he hopes to be one of the few high school-to-NBA players who contributes immediately . <p> " Who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ebi said . " I 'm going to take my time , work hard , learn the plays and try to play right away . Whatever happens happens . But we all know if you work hard , hard work will not let you down . " <p> Flashes of brilliance are what convinced the Timberwolves that Ebi was worth taking . <p> Flashes of brilliance are what have convinced players like John Wallace , who spent six years in the NBA before playing in Greece last season , that Ebi will soon be a force . <p> One particular flash stands out . <p> During a recent workout , Ebi drove the lane strong and missed a runner . Wallace said that before defenders were done reacting to the move , Ebi had risen and was hanging on the rim after dunking home the missed shot . <p> " I was like , ' Damn ! That kid 's athletic , ' " said Wallace , who is teaming with Ebi on the Timberwolves ' summer league team . " He 's amazingly athletic . There 's no question he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 'll be about him keeping his head strong . Once you get up here , everybody 's talented - though he is going to be more physically gifted than most - so you have to handle it mentally . Looks to me like he 's got that down . " <p> Ebi , who had four blocks and four steals in two summer-league games , has also impressed with his defense . <p> Shortly into his first game against NBA players Tuesday , he blocked the first offering from Detroit 's Tayshaun Prince . <p> " He 's athletic , he attacks the glass , and he 's got those long arms , " Prince said . " There were situations where he made our guys and myself take tough shots . You can see the talent that he has . " <p> Prince , a virtual stickman by NBA standards at 6-9 , 215 pounds , said the belief that Ebi is too light at 6-9 , 195 is n't accurate . <p> " When you 're thin like us , you have to play aggressive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He blocks shots and shows he 's not going to back down . He 's only going to get better and better . " <p> That is what Minnesota , which signed Ebi to a three-year , $ 2.7 million contract just weeks after the 19-year-old graduated , is banking on . <p> Ebi , the first high school player taken by Minnesota since Kevin Garnett ( 1995 ) , is labeled as a project by some . But Minnesota vice president of basketball operations Kevin McHale called the NBA a " project business . " <p> When the draft was approaching , all McHale could think about was what he said when he called head coach Flip Saunders after watching the McDonald 's All-American game . <p> " LeBron James - he 's a monster ; he 's unbelievable , " McHale told Saunders , " and the kid going to Arizona is going to be an unbelievable player . <p> " Most of the other kids that walked out for that workout were a little intimidated by LeBron James , but he took him on and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very competitive . Really got after it and showed a lot of heart . No fear whatsoever . " <p> Ebi , the kid going to Arizona , ended up going pro instead , and the Timberwolves believe they got a steal . <p> " As we looked at it , if this kid goes to college , then in a year or two he 's probably a top-10 , top-five pick , " Saunders said . " He does some things - his athleticism , ability to run the floor , ability to block shots - where he does that at a high level . His change is going to be able to play every play at that high level . That 's the biggest change young kids have to make coming into this level . " <p> Ebi said the energy required has already been taxing , what with practices and workouts and then scrimmages and now games . But he feels he is adjusting to it . <p> " I 'm just playing right now , trying to get into the flow , " Ebi said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the NBA . It 's rough ; it 's not high school . I ca n't complain about it . I just have to deal with it . " <p> He also had to deal with a long line of autograph seekers after his first summer-league game . After seeing Ebi fly around the court , fans must have figured he might one day be a star . <p> " It 's going to happen , " Wallace said . " No doubt . " <p> <p> FIVE-PART STORY <p> Observers believe Ndudi Ebi 's makeup makes him an NBA talent and will one day make him a star . His attributes : <p> ARMS <p> Ebi is 6-9 , with a wingspan of a 7-footer . Detroit forward Tayshaun Prince said he was shocked Ebi blocked his shot from a standstill more than an arm 's length away . <p> LEGS <p> Ebi has extraordinary spring that puts him on par with the league 's leapers . Perhaps more importantly , he 's quick off the floor and does n't need a running start to elevate . <p> HANDS <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ebi gets his hands on a lot of passes defensively . One T-Wolves teammate described him as a deflection magnet . <p> HEART <p> Ebi weighs just 195 pounds , but he wo n't back down from a physical challenge . He shows a willingness to dish it out as much as he takes it , and he gives no quarter to older , stronger foes . <p> HEAD <p> Call it hardheadedness if you like , but Ebi refuses to listen to doubters . That 's why he entered the draft . That confidence should serve him well as he tries to make it in the league . <p> <p> All the right moves ? <p> Since Kevin Garnett joined the Timberwolves straight from high school in 1995 , 27 players have tried to do the same . Here is how some of them taken after the NBA draft 's lottery picks have fared : <p> Player High school Drafted Year Team <p> Jermaine O'Neal Eau Claire ( S.C. ) 17th 1996 Blazers <p> Did n't even average five points a game in any of four seasons in Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three seasons ago . <p> Al Harrington St. Patrick 's ( N.J. ) 25th 1998 Pacers <p> After a slow start , has become a solid contributor , averaging 13.1 points and 6.3 rebounds two years ago and 12.2 and 6.2 this past season . <p> Rashard Lewis Elsik 32nd 1998 Sonics <p> The three-year starter is knocking on All-Star status after posting 18.1 points and 6.5 rebounds per game last season . <p> Korleone Young Hargrave Military ( Va. ) 40th 1998 Pistons <p> Had his number called all of three times during his rookie season before being cut at the end of the year . Those three games are likely to be the extent of his NBA career . <p> Leon Smith M.L. King ( Ill. ) 29th 1999 Spurs <p> Mental health issues curtailed his NBA career . While the Final Four was being played at the Louisiana Superdome in April , Smith was in New Orleans as a backup with the Harlem Globetrotters . <p> DeShawn Stevenson Washington ( Calif. ) 23rd 2000 Jazz <p> Has had a run-in with the law , was suspended for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ game in three undistinguished seasons . <p> Ousmane Cisse St. Jude ( Ala. ) 47th 2001 Nuggets <p> Suffered a serious knee injury before rookie season and missed four months . Was out of the league the next year . Has played in Europe , with the Globetrotters and in the USBL.
