Chapter One Maniac Magee was not born in a dump . He was born in a house , a pretty ordinary house , right across the river from here , in Bridgeport . And he had regular parents , a mother and a father . But not for long . One day his parents left him with a sitter and took the P &; W high-speed trolley into the city . On the way back home , they were on board when the P &; W had its famous crash , when the motorman was drunk and took the high trestle over the Schuylkill River at sixty miles an hour , and the whole caboodle took a swan dive into the water . And just like that . Maniac was an orphan . He was three years old . Of course , to be accurate , he was n't really Maniac then . He was Jeffrey . Jeffrey Lionel Magee . Little Jeffrey was shipped off to his nearest relatives , Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan . They lived in Hollidaysburg , in the western part of Pennsylvania @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but because they were strict Catholics , they would n't get a divorce . Around the time Jeffrey arrived , they stopped talking to each other . Then they stopped sharing . Pretty soon there were two of everything in the house . Two bathrooms . Two TVs . Two refrigerators . Two toasters . If it were possible , they would have had two Jeffreys . As it was , they split him up as best they could . For instance , he would eat dinner with Aunt Dot on Monday , with Uncle Dan on Tuesday , and so on . Eight years of that . Then came the night of the spring musicale at Jeffrey 's school . He was in the chorus . There was only one show , and one auditorium , so Aunt Dot and Uncle Dan were forced to share at least that much . Aunt Dot sat on one side . Uncle Dan on the other . Jeffrey probably started screaming from the start of the song , which was " Talk to the Animals , " but nobody knew it because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the music ended , and Jeffrey went right on screaming , his face bright red by now , his neck bulging . The music director faced the singers , frozen with his arms still raised . In the audience faces began to change . There was a quick smatter of giggling by some people who figured the screaming kid was some part of the show , some funny animal maybe . Then the giggling stopped , and eyes started to shift and heads started to turn , because now everybody could see that this was n't part of the show at all , that little Jeffrey Magee was n't supposed to be up there on the risers , pointing to his aunt and uncle , bellowing out from the midst of the chorus : " Talk ! Talk , will ya ! Talk ! Talk ! Talk ! " No one knew it then , but it was the birth scream of a legend . And that 's when the running started . Three springy steps down from the risers - girls in pastel dresses screaming , the music director lunging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and into the starry , sweet , onion-grass-smelling night . Never again to return to the house of two toasters . Never again to return to school . ( Continues ... )
