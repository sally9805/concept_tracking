It is the tale of FitzChivalry Farseer . The discovery that this bastard son exists is enough to topple Prince Chivalry 's ambition for the throne . He abdicates , ceding the title of heir to the throne to his younger brother Verity and abandoning the child to the care of the stablemaster Burrich . The youngest prince , Regal , has ambitions of his own , and wishes to do away with the bastard . But old King Shrewd sees the value of taking the lad and training him as an assassin . For a bastard can be sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and may be given tasks that would soil an heir 's hands . And so FitzChivalry is trained in the secret arts of being a royal assassin . He shows a predilection for the Wit , a beast magic much despised in the Six Duchies . This secret vice in the young assassin is tolerated , for a partnership with an animal may be a useful trait in an assassin . When it is discovered that he may possess the hereditary magic of the Farseers , the Skill , he becomes both the King 's weapon and an obstacle to Prince Regal 's ambitions for the throne . At a time when the rivalry for the throne is intense , and the Outislanders and their Red Ship raiders are bringing war to the Six Duchies , FitzChivalry discovers that the fate of the kingdom may very well reston the actions of a young bastard and the King 's Fool . Armed with little more than loyalty and his sporadic talent for the old magic , Fitz follows the fading trail of King Verity , who has traveled beyond the Mountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in what may be a vain hope to renew an old alliance . The Liveship Traders Trilogy takes place in Jamaillia , Bingtown , and the Pirate Isles , on the coast far to the south of the Six Duchies . The war in the north has interrupted the trade that is the lifeblood of Bingtown , and the Liveship Traders have fallen on hard times despite their magic sentient ships . At one time , possession of a Liveship , constructed of magical wizardwood , guaranteed a Trader 's family prosperity . Only a Liveship can brave the dangers of the Rain Wild River and trade with the legendary Rain Wild Traders and their mysterious magical goods , plundered from the enigmatic Elderling ruins . Althea Vestrit expects her families to adhere to tradition and pass the family Liveship on to her when it quickens at the death of her father . Instead , the Vivacia goes to her sister Keffria and her scheming Chalcedean husband , Kyle . The proud Liveship becomes a transport vessel for the despised but highly profitable slave trade . Althea , cast out on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world and somehow regain control of her family 's living ship . Her old shipmate Brashen Trell , the mysterious woodcarver Amber , and the Paragon , the notorious mad Liveship , are the only allies she can rally to her cause . Pirates , a slave rebellion , migrating sea serpents , and a newly hatched dragon are but a few of the obstacles she must face on her way to discovering that Liveships are not , perhaps , what they seem to be , and may have dreams of their own to follow . The Tawny Man Trilogy , a work still in progress at this writing , picks up the tale of Fitz and the Fool some fifteen years after the Red Ship wars . Queen Kettricken is determined to secure her son 's throne by arranging a marriage between Prince Dutiful and Elliana , the daughter of their old enemies in the Outislands . But the Six Duchies themselves are restless . The Witted are weary of persecution , and may choose to topple the throne of the Farseers by revealing that young Prince Dutiful carries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sets a high price on her hand : Dutiful must present her with the head of Icefyre , the legendary dragon of Aslevjal Island . Meanwhile , to the south , the Bingtown Traders continue to wage war against the Chalcedeans , and seek to enlist the Six Duchies into the effort to obliterate Chalced . Bingtown 's temperamental ally , the dragon Tintaglia , has her own reasons for supporting them in this , reasons that may lead not only to the restoration of the race of dragons but also to the return of Elderling magic to the Cursed Shores . HOMECOMING Robin Hobb Day the 7th of the Fish Moon Year the 14th of the reign of the Most Noble and Magnificent Satrap Esclepius Confiscated from me this day , without cause or justice , were five crates and three trunks . This occurred during the loading of the ship Venture , setting forth upon Satrap Esclepius ' noble endeavor to colonize the Cursed Shores . Contents of the crates are as follows : One block fine white marble , of a size suitable for a bust , two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large fine soapstone , as tall as a man and as wide as a man , seven large copper ingots , of excellent quality , three silver ingots , of acceptable quality , and three kegs of wax . One crate contained scales , tools for the working of metal and stone , and measuring equipment . Contents of trunks are as follows : Two silk gowns , one blue , one pink , tailored by Seamstress Wista and bearing her mark . A dress-length of mille-cloth , green . Two shawls , one white wool , one blue linen . Several pairs hose , in winter and summer weights . Three pairs of slippers , one silk and worked with rosebuds . Seven petticoats , three silk , one linen and three wool . One bodice frame , of light bone and silk . Three volumes of poetry , written in my own hand . A miniature by Soiji , of myself , Lady Carillion Carrock , ne Waljin , commissioned by my mother , Lady Arston Waljin , on the occasion of my fourteenth birthday . Also included were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four years , and two boys , of six and ten years , including both winter and summer garb for formal occasions . I record this confiscation so that the thieves can be brought to justice upon my return to Jamaillia City . The theft was in this manner : As our ship was being loaded for departure , cargo belonging to various nobles aboard the vessels was detained upon the docks . Captain Triops informed us that our possessions would be held , indefinitely , in the Satrap 's custody . I do not trust the man , for he shows neither my husband nor myself proper deference . So I make this record , and when I return this coming spring to Jamaillia City , my father , Lord Crion Waljin , will bring my complaint before the Satrap 's Court of Justice , as my husband seems little inclined to do so . This do I swear . Lady Carillion Waljin Carrock Day the 10th of the Fish Moon Year the 14th of the reign of the Most Noble and Magnificent Satrap Esclepius Conditions aboard the ship are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journal to record the hardship and injustice to preserve a record so that those responsible may be punished . Although I am nobly born , of the house of Waljin , and although my lord husband is not only noble , but heir to the title of Lord Carrock , the quarters given us are no better than those allotted to the common emigrants and speculators , that is , a smelly space in the ship 's hold . Only the common criminals , chained in the deepest holds , suffer more than we do . The floor is a splintery wooden deck , the walls are the bare planks of the ship 's hull . There is much evidence that rats were the last inhabitants of this compartment . We are treated no better than cattle . There are no separate quarters for my maid , so I must suffer her to bed almost alongside us ! To preserve my children from the common brats of the emigrants , I have sacrificed three damask hangings to curtain off a space . Those people accord me no respect . I believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When they mock me , my husband bids me ignore them . This has had a dreadful effect on my servant 's behavior . This morning , my maid , who also serves as a nanny in our reduced household , spoke almost harshly to young Petrus , bidding him be quiet and cease his questions . When I rebuked her for it , she dared to raise her brows at me . My visit to the open deck was a waste of time . It is cluttered with ropes , canvas , and crude men , with no provisions for ladies and children to take the air . The sea was boring , the view only distant foggy islands . I found nothing there to cheer me as this detestable vessel bears me ever farther away from the lofty white spires of Blessed Jamaillia City , sacred to Sa . I have no friends aboard the ship to amuse or comfort me in my heaviness . Lady Duparge has called on me once , and I was civil , but the differences in our station make conversation difficult . Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two ships , and one estate that borders on Gerfen Swamp . Ladies Crifton and Anxory appear content with one another 's company and have not called upon me at all . They are both too young to have any accomplishments to share , yet their mothers should have instructed them in their social responsibility to their betters . Both might have profited from my friendship upon our return to Jamaillia City . That they choose not to court my favor does not speak well of their intellect . Doubtless they would bore me . I am miserable in these disgusting surroundings . Why my husband has chosen to invest his time and finances in this venture eludes me . Surely men of a more adventurous nature would better serve our Illustrious Satrap in this exploration . Nor can I understand why our children and myself must accompany him , especially in my condition . I do not think my husband gave any thought to the difficulties this voyage would pose for a woman gravid with child . As ever , he has not seen fit to discuss his decisions with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my artistic pursuits . Yet my ambitions must suffer to allow him to pursue his ! My absence will substantially delay the completion of my Suspended Chimes of Stone and Metal . The Satrap 's brother will be most disappointed , for the installation was to have honored this thirtieth birthday . Day the 15th of the Fish Moon Year the 14th of the reign of the most Noble and Exalted Satrap Esclepius I have been foolish . No . I have been deceived . It is not foolishness to trust where one has every right to expect trustworthiness . When my father entrusted my hand and my fate to Lord Jathan Carrock , he believed he was a man of wealth , substance , and reputation . My father blessed Sa 's name that my artistic accomplishments had attracted a suitor of such lofty stature . When I bewailed the fate that wed me to a man so much my senior , my mother counseled me to accept it and to pursue my art and establish my reputation in the shelter of his influence . I honored their wisdom . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty faded in his shadow , I have borne him three children , and bear beneath my heart the burgeoning seed of yet another . I have been an ornament and a blessing to him , and yet he has deceived me . When I think of the hours spent managing his household , hours I could have devoted to my art , my blood seethes with bitterness . Today , I first entreated , and then , in the throes of my duty to provide for my children , demanded that he force the Captain to give us bet- ter quarters . Sending our three children out onto the deck with their nanny , he confessed that we were not willing investors in the Satrap 's colonization plan but exiles given a chance to flee our disgrace . All we left behind , estates , homes , precious possessions , horses , cattle . . . all are forfeit to the Satrap , as are the items seized from us as we embarked . My genteel respectable husband is a traitor to our gentle and beloved Satrap and a plotter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admission from him , bit by bit . He kept saying I should not bother about the politics , that it was solely his concern . He said a wife should trust her husband to manage their lives . He said that by the time the ships resupply our settlement next spring , he would have redeemed our fortune and we would return to Jamaillian society . But I kept pressing my silly woman 's questions . All your holdings seized ? I asked him . All ? And he said it was done to save the Carrock name , so that his parents and younger brother can live with dignity , untarnished by the scandal . A small estate remains for his brother to inherit . The Satrap 's Court will believe that Jathan Carrock chose to invest his entire fortune in the Satrap 's venture . Only those in the Satrap 's innermost circle know it was a confiscation . To win this concession , Jathan begged many hours on his knees , humbling himself and pleading forgiveness . He went on at great length about that , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his knees . " What of Thistlebend ? " I asked . " What of the cottage by the ford there , and the moneys from it ? " This I brought to him as my marriage portion , and humble though it is , I thought to see it passed to Narissa when she wed . " Gone , " he said , " all gone . " " But why ? " I demanded . " I have not plotted against the Satrap . Why am I punished ? "
