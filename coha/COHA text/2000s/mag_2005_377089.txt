If you did n't get your fill of gadgets and gizmos over the holidays , the Consumer Electronics Show ( CES ) , held last week in Las Vegas , was the place to be . There 's always a contest over who has the largest plasma TV . This time around , Samsung has a 102-in. set but no plans to sell it in the U.S. ; LG will sell its 71-incher for $75,000 . There are also always plenty of exciting trends . Here are four of the most intriguing : <P> 1 <P> IT 'S NOT TV , IT 'S SED <P> New TV technologies usually receive the CES crowd 's most opinionated harrumphs , and this year the SED flat-panel technology developed by Toshiba and Canon was at the center of scrutiny . Billed as the technology that could bring down plasma , SED takes the idea of conventional cathode-ray-tube televisions and miniaturizes it : instead of one big electron gun exciting all the phosphors on a screen in sequence , millions of little electrical nodes do the same thing simultaneously . The result @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LCD with a much lower power drain . Toshiba says that production costs over time could make SED TVs relatively affordable , but the first , a big-screen set scheduled for launch this year , will cost a wheelbarrow of cash filled to an as-yet-undisclosed height . <P> 2 <P> LISTENING TO MUSIC ( AND MORE ) THE WIRELESS WAY <P> Going wireless is a constant theme in electronics today , but one cord that is still hanging around is the one that tethers stereo headphones to portable music players . This year everyone seems to be jumping for the chance to cut it . Creative Labs is introducing wireless headphones and an adapter for its Zen Micro that uses a technology called magnetic induction for a clean signal and long battery life . The kit will be available this spring for $150 , possibly along with a universal wireless kit for other M players . Motorola and Toshiba are both launching wireless wraparound headphones that use Bluetooth wireless networking to connect to laptops and cell phones , and HP recently introduced a similar pair , primarily for use with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their features , partnering them with one of these headsets will be easy . In the meantime , Belkin will offer TuneStage , a Bluetooth adapter for late-model iPods , which runs on the iPod 's battery power . <P> Perhaps the coolest wireless device , however , is a snowboarding jacket from Burton , which teamed up with Motorola for the design . Like a previous BURTON JACKET , it connects to an iPod to jam music on the slopes . But this beauty can also route phone calls to the headphones hidden in the hood . <P> 3 <P> EXTREME CAMCORDING <P> No longer just a sidearm for doting daddies , camcorders are branching out . SAMSUNG 'S SC-X105L ( available in March for $600 ) has a separate wide-angle lens that you can attach , by way of headband or armband , to your extremities . The camcorder itself stays safely tucked inside your jacket or carrying case while the remote lens captures all your adrenalized action . Another innovation : Sony 's DCR-DVD403 DVD Handycam ( out this spring for $1,000 ) brings richness to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it automatically onto a DVD in genuine Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound . <P> 4 <P> BROADBAND GOES CELLULAR
