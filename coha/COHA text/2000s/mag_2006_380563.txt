Sahar Ashour Nema has been visited twice by Iraq 's sectarian demons . Two years ago , her husband , a Shi'ite laborer , was murdered by Sunni militants , who decapitated him , then hacked his body to pieces and set ablaze his small mobile home in western Baghdad . Before taking her children with her to live in her father 's home in nearby al-Haswa , Nema returned one last time to their old neighborhood  --  just long enough to collect her husband 's charred body parts in a plastic bag so he could have a decent burial . Her Sunni neighbors were impassive . " Nobody offered to help me in any way , " she says , her face hardening at the memory . <P> But that departure was almost amiable compared with the one Nema had to make from al-Haswa last week . For months , Nema says , the mixed neighborhood 's young Shi'ite men had been disappearing , their bodies turning up days later . Gradually , Shi'ites and Sunnis had stopped talking to each other . After the bombing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Shi'ite reprisals that followed , the atmosphere in al-Haswa turned toxic . The killings accelerated , and pamphlets began appearing in the street denouncing Shi'ites as " spies and betrayers " and demanding that they leave  --  or else . By the time Nema and her family fled , roads in and out of the neighborhood were manned by armed Sunnis who were roughing up and robbing the departing Shi'ites . The family abandoned most of its belongings and finally made it to a cousin 's house in the Shi'ite neighborhood of al-Shulla . " We were lucky to find an unguarded exit , " she says , her breath still catching with fear as she narrates their escape . <P> Most Iraqis cling to hope that the country wo n't descend into all-out civil war . But the sectarian violence that has racked the country over the past two weeks has upended the lives of thousands of families like Nema 's , forcing them to leave their homes and changing the complexion of cities like Baghdad , perhaps forever . Across the capital , mixed neighborhoods have undergone the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have sought safety in their sectarian communities . In areas where Shi'ites and Sunnis once lived in tolerance , even harmony , the two sides are drawing sectarian lines to separate themselves from each other  --  even as Iraqi politicians and U.S. diplomats express hope that the risk of an imminent outbreak of communal conflict is receding . " If you are a minority in a neighborhood , you have to get out , " says Adil Faaq Mohammed , a Sunni security guard at the Iraqi Health Ministry . " If you stay , your own neighbors will turn against you . "
