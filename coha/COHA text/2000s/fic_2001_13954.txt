Charlotte , wearing a long white nightdress , enters the living room from her bedroom . It is early morning . She sees a note lying on the coffee table , walks over to it , picks it up and reads it to herself . She smiles . Cab , wearing linen pajama bottoms , comes out of her bedroom and stands watching her . She is aware he is watching her . Without looking around , she reads the note , a poem , aloud . CHARLOTTE I want to lie with you on a rainy morning in a bed that swallows us both.I want to make love to you til you beg me , please , stop.I want to love you right up to that door I come to sometimes in the loose mad glory of our love , that door in the penetrable darkness of our , what , existence ? I want to love you right up to that door and then go right straight through it . A moment . She does n't turn around . CHARLOTTE Where did this come from ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a poem . CHARLOTTE Was it you ? He walks toward her reciting the note . CAB I want to lie with you on a rainy morning in a bed that swallows us both . I want to make love to you til you beg me- p. 3 CHARLOTTE ( not reading ) Please , stop . CAB You do n't like it ? CHARLOTTE I like the part about the door . CAB You do n't like the loose mad glory part ? She turns around to him . CHARLOTTE I like the loose mad glory itself . CAB I want to write about our love . I know you 're the writer in the house , but- CHARLOTTE It 's all right . CAB I want you to know how it makes me feel . Gently , she breaks out of the embrace and walks over to look at a painting on an easel . CHARLOTTE I believe I have some idea , Cab . CAB No . I do n't believe you do . In the wake of our passion last night and this morning , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ While I am standing here practically mute . Do you swear that you love me ? CHARLOTTE I do . CAB ( a little testy ) Then why ca n't we ever go down into the village together , to the market even ? p. 4 CHARLOTTE Because I like to buy vegetables by myself . CAB Or sit in a caf and have coffee ? And why ca n't I live here ? If I 'm in your bed every night , why do I have to spend my days in the cottage ? Either you do n't want your old French relatives to know about us , which ca n't be the case because you do n't care what anybody thinks , or you 're ashamed of me . Are you ashamed of me ? CHARLOTTE I might be ashamed of keeping such a beautiful young man up here all to myself . CAB Then why do n't you throw me over the cliff and see how soon another man even younger than I am comes up here with a bottle of wine and something he wants to read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . CAB You should write a new novel . Then I could read that to you . CHARLOTTE You sound like my editor . CAB Well , she ca n't help but wonder . Why is Charlotte Burns still in France , I know she has a little place there somewhere . And what is she writing and when can I read it , and when is she coming home ? She gets closer to the painting . CHARLOTTE Let her wonder . ( a moment ) Why do n't Randall DellaMar 's paintings have any people in them ? p. 5 CAB Because they 're landscapes . CAB You did n't answer my question . CHARLOTTE About going into the village , yes I did . CAB My question about why I ca n't live here . Charlotte has walked to the window . She sees someone coming up the hill . CHARLOTTE Oh dear . I did n't realize how late it was . We have to get dressed . CAB No we do n't . CHARLOTTE ( she goes upstairs to dress ) I 'm sorry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God ! ( headed for the kitchen ) How long is going to stay anyway . CHARLOTTE ( from off ) Just a few days . CAB And is the rest of Savannah coming tomorrow ? Do n't they have a law about how many Southerners can be in the south of France at any one time ? CHARLOTTE Her new poems are wonderful . CAB No they 're not . They 're self-conscious and too pretty . She is always watching herself writing . Is n't this line good . Is n't this just the right word . p. 6 CHARLOTTE Well . We 're trying to get over that . CAB And if only she were trying as hard as you are , she might get somewhere . I think you should stop teaching her . If word gets around that you 're teaching again , there 'll be a line of starving poets from here to St Tropez . CHARLOTTE I 'm not her teacher . CAB Shall I make you some coffee ? CHARLOTTE I 'm her Godmother . I think . I forget if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like her . CHARLOTTE You have n't even spent one hour talking to her . You have n't ever even taken a walk with her . How can you say you do n't like her ? CAB I do n't like anyone that you like . CHARLOTTE ( enters finishing dressing ) I think she makes you nervous . CAB Maybe I 'll kill her . Get one of the old crones from the village to concoct a little poison tea for her . I 'll invite her to sit with me out on your terrace , we 'll sip tea , we 'll watch the sun sink into the ocean , and then she 'll die . The end . CHARLOTTE And will you be happy then ? p. 7 CAB Then I will have you all to myself forever . CHARLOTTE And will you be happy then ? CAB Actually , I could give her the death tea this morning . I have some left from that batch I bought for that composer who kept traipsing up here with his flute . CHARLOTTE ( seeing someone else out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! CAB Not Randall DellaMar . If you invited Randall DellaMar to breakfast , I 'm going to drink the death tea myself . CHARLOTTE I did n't invite him to breakfast . But maybe they spent the evening together and Georgeanne invited him . She turns away from the window . The note is still in her hand . She turns it over . CHARLOTTE What is this ? You 've written more ? CAB It 's nothing . CHARLOTTE I did n't realize- She stops , reading to herself . CAB You did n't realize there was more to me than my slavish , sexual devotion to you ? She reads the other side of the note , a poem , aloud . CHARLOTTE Spare me your patience , your calm . Your heartless disregard . I can not bear it now.Though I have on many occasions found it amusing and may again . p. 8 CAB I was angry . CHARLOTTE What do you want , Cab ? CAB I want you , Charlotte . Your heart , your time , your days and nights , all for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodness CAB I want you to send these people away and marry me , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE ( alarmed ) Marry you . CAB Is n't that what people do who love each other ? CHARLOTTE ( looking out the window ) Cab , they 're coming right up the walk . CAB Marry me , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE ( then back to him ) Cabot Gray , I want your word of honor you will not cause trouble in this house . You will be sweet to my young friend , Georgeanne , and you will be respectful to my old friend , Randall . CAB What is he doing here anyway . I hate him . And he hates France , I can see it in his paintings . I think he intends to take you away from me . CHARLOTTE Your word of honor . CAB I have no honor where you are concerned , Charlotte . He turns and goes back into the bedroom . The front door is not locked , but Georgeanne pushes it open only slightly . She carries an armful of wildflowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but pretty in an unobtrusive way . p. 9 GEORGEANNE Charlotte ? Are you decent ? It 's Georgeanne . CHARLOTTE I know it 's you , darling . But where is Randall ? I thought he was with you . GEORGEANNE I do n't know where he went . One minute I was asking him if he knew of any edible lizards , like my mother told me to , and the next minute he was gone . CHARLOTTE Well , maybe he went to find you one . Or maybe he was just embarrassed to turn up this morning looking like your latest conquest . GEORGEANNE Oh no , Charlotte . Randall is way too- ( she stops ) far beyond anyone who might be interested in someone like me . CHARLOTTE Were you going to say old ? That he was too old for you ? Old does n't apply to men like Randall . GEORGEANNE I was n't going to say old . CHARLOTTE He is quite a lover . Or so they say . GEORGEANNE Who said that ? Not my mother . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are beautiful . Thank you , darling . ( Georgeanne follows her ) It was always hard for me to believe Randall could be such a good lover , given that he also had so much money . But he is a remarkable man , and pleasure interests him . Maybe he is a master of the erotic arts . He would certainly like for us to think so . p. 10 GEORGEANNE ( delicately ) Do you mean that you and Randall never- CHARLOTTE No , dear . We never did . We have a deep and desperate friendship . So we did n't dare risk anything else . Have you had your coffee ? Cab said he was going to make us some but he seems to have disappeared . Cab enters from the bedroom , dressed . CAB I 'm going down to the village . Do you need anything ? CHARLOTTE Cab , you remember Georgeanne . CAB From supper last night ? And lunch yesterday ? Yes , I remember . Georgeanne seems very nervous suddenly . Cab does n't even stop . GEORGEANNE Good morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CAB I will be here . He goes straight to the door and walks out . Georgeanne is practically speechless from the sight of this young man . GEORGEANNE He 's so beautiful . CHARLOTTE I know . And I 've been thinking about this for quite a while . But I 've made up my mind now . I want you to have him . GEORGEANNE Have him . p. 11 CHARLOTTE Yes . GEORGEANNE But he 's yours . CHARLOTTE I know . But I 'm going to give him to you . GEORGEANNE But he adores you . Why would anybody who could have you , want me ? He never even speaks to me . CHARLOTTE He might , if you left him a little note at his cottage , or better yet , a poem . GEORGEANNE But my poems are hopeless . Is n't that what you think ? CHARLOTTE You 're not a writer yet , no . But you could become one if you find the right subject . Maybe it will be love . Or Cab . Do you drink coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Charlotte busies herself in the kitchen , effortlessly setting out a beautiful tray of pastries . GEORGEANNE Do you have a new lover in mind ? Is that why you want to give Cab to someone ? CHARLOTTE I do n't want to give him to someone . I want to give him to you . I want to live up here by myself now . I want to be alone . GEORGEANNE But Cab seems like he would be such a- CHARLOTTE A magnificent lover , an animated companion ? Indeed he is. p. 12 GEORGEANNE Then I do n't understand . CHARLOTTE ( a moment , then grandly ) It 's very simple , child . I am tired of love . GEORGEANNE But how can that be ? CHARLOTTE I know . I could never have imagined it myself , but I am tired of smiling and being smiled at , watching and being watched . Tired of thinking about it , wondering what may happen , what another mouth will be like , what another tongue may do GEORGEANNE looking awayCharlotte ! CHARLOTTE Oh now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me such things . CHARLOTTE Well , you may not want to know them , but as your godmother and guide , I am honor bound to prepare you for what may lie down the road . Randall DellaMar walks in the door . He is sexy , grand , and very entertaining . DELLAMAR Down what road ? CHARLOTTE Hello , Randall . DELLAMAR ( to Georgeanne ) You are n't forsaking us , are you , darling ? But you only arrived yesterday . And you know practically nothing about the continent . You wo n't be safe . ( he kisses Charlotte ) Good morning , Charlotte . You are even more beautiful than you were last night . You must 've slept well . And you have me to thank for that , I want you to know . I put a sleeping draught in young Cabernet 's wine last night so he would n't force himself on you endlessly . I trust it worked . p. 13 CHARLOTTE Do n't talk like that Randall . Georgeanne will believe you . DELLAMAR I know . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relation whatsoever to the truth . GEORGEANNE Cab 's name is really Cabernet ? DELLAMAR I 'm sorry , darling . It is n't fair of me to make fun of him . He means well , I 'm sure . His name is actually Cabana . As in boy . Or maybe it 's pronounced cabaa , I do n't recall . CHARLOTTE His name is Cabot . GEORGEANNE Thank you . DELLAMAR And where is young Romeo ? CHARLOTTE He 's sulking . He does n't like guests . DELLAMAR Well , I ca n't say as I blame him there . Tell me , Charlotte , what was the longest time you were ever with one of your lovers without either of you leaving the house ? You do n't have to answer that . Not that I would n't like to know , of course , and I 've been trying to think what my answer would be ever since I thought of the question . GEORGEANNE Perhaps this would be a good time for me to- DELLAMAR No . I forbid your departure , I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until I can better grasp what kind of creature you are exactly . p. 14 GEORGEANNE Oh I was n't going away away . The long road Charlotte was telling me about when you came in , was life . I think . CHARLOTTE I was telling her that I was tired of love , and that she would be too , eventually . DELLAMAR She was lying , child . That 's what writers do . CHARLOTTE I was comforting her . In the unlikely event that someone Georgeanne desired would fail to return her affections and break her heart . DELLAMAR Well of course her heart will be broken . Do you mean that this has not yet occurred ? But what are you waiting for , child . A broken heart is sheer tragic delight . GEORGEANNE I do n't think I could survive it . DELLAMAR Oh on the contrary . I have found nothing as miraculous in all of life as the moment you look up from the complete devastation of a love affair and see another stunning woman across the room . GEORGEANNE But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? DELLAMAR What if she is ? GEORGEANNE Do you mean that would n't matter to you ? DELLAMAR Not when I am sitting in the wreckage of my life . Not in the slightest . Whether this beautiful woman is spoken for or not , she is still beautiful , and it matters not one whit whether I send her a drink which she throws to the floor and I never see her again , or I slither to her side and we spend the next year struggling to survive each other . The first moment I see this woman , I know I will love again , and that is all that matters . Charlotte , darling , what is the minutest amount of time it ever took you to fall in love ? p. 15 CHARLOTTE I 'm not sure I 've ever fallen in love , Randall . DELLAMAR Oh of course you have . You ca n't be an American and not fall in love . It 's our national pastime . Not to mention the coin of the realm , the means they use to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLOTTE I 'm not sure I 've ever been in love , Randall . DELLAMAR Oh of course you have . You ca n't be an American and not fall in love . It 's our national pastime , not to mention the coin of the realm , the means they use to sell us everything they think we ought to have . GEORGEANNE They who ? GEORGEANNE Are you talking about the advertisers ? The media ? The models with their nipples showing in magazines . CHARLOTTE I do n't think we can pin the exploitation of love on the models . DELLAMAR I love the exploitation of love . And I love the models . What I object to is the absurd notion that the products the models are selling will help us attract the one and only person on earth who will truly love us . CHARLOTTE You see , Georgeanne . Randall thinks love is a game . GEORGEANNE Love is not a game . p. 16 DELLAMAR Love is the joyous game of life , Georgeanne . And the joy of it derives directly from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and marry , no single love , the loss of which you would not survive . Why , take Charlotte . Think how dull her work would have been had she confined herself to one man . CHARLOTTE Randall ! GEORGEANNE But I am nothing like Charlotte . I fear I will never find anyone . CHARLOTTE That 's enough , Georgeanne . DELLAMAR If it would help , I could make myself available , for the afternoon . GEORGEANNE How would that help ? You would only be doing it to make me feel better . DELLAMAR I would like for you to feel better . GEORGEANNE But I would know you did n't really care for me . DELLAMAR And how would you know that ? Georgeanne is taken with a fury we would n't have expected from her . GEORGEANNE Because I would remember that we all sat here talking about somebody breaking my heart , and you volunteered to take me to lunch or bed or wherever it is you have in mind , and I will remember that you were feeling sorry for me and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will just be too sad . p. 17 DELLAMAR What will be sad is that you will have missed what was available because you were only concentrating on what was not . GEORGEANNE You would take me off for the afternoon even if I were deeply in love with someone else ? DELLAMAR It would be a pleasure . CHARLOTTE Well I forbid it . I absolutely forbid it . I will not have Georgeanne at your mercy before she has even had her toast . DELLAMAR Georgeanne , did you feel you were at my mercy last evening ? GEORGEANNE No , no . Charlotte is not happy . CHARLOTTE I did not bring Georgeanne here so you could confuse her with your attention . Randall is wildly amused by this sudden show of jealousy . DELLAMAR She did n't seem confused to me. ( then to Georgeanne ) Were your confused , child ? CHARLOTTE Did he seduce you ? GEORGEANNE We talked about you , Charlotte . That 's all . CHARLOTTE Well I wo n't have it . DELLAMAR Well I do n't think you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLOTTE In my house I can . DELLAMAR We were n't in your house . We were in one of the local drinking establishments . GEORGEANNE We had a glass of wine and I told Randall I had written a poem for you and he read it and said I should under no circumstances show it to you . Randall makes a false show of contrition . DELLAMAR See there ? Charlotte begins to try to recover her equilibrium here . She does n't like how much she showed of herself . CHARLOTTE You were talking about poetry ? GEORGEANNE I was mostly maundering on about how unworthy I am of your attention . Randall was kind enough to listen . CHARLOTTE Well then , perhaps I was wrong about the two of you . DELLAMAR Not entirely . CHARLOTTE Oh now you 're just trying to make me miserable . DELLAMAR I 'm not even half trying , really . It seems to have gotten easier . CHARLOTTE I 'm not sure I like having you here , Randall . Did I actually invite you ? DELLAMAR Georgeanne , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this morning ? I believe our beloved Charlotte could use some time to herself . p. 19 DELLAMAR You said you were a little blue . Yes . CHARLOTTE So you got on a plane and came to the south of France . You dropped whatever you were doing to come here and make me miserable . CHARLOTTE It 's only you I want to leave , Randall . DELLAMAR But if I go by myself I will feel lonely and forlorn . I who have dropped whatever I was doing and- CHARLOTTE Fine . Take Georgeanne and go for a stroll somewhere . But come back for lunch . DELLAMAR And shall we bring some arugula ? CHARLOTTE If you say one more thing I will pack up and leave . DELLAMAR And then we will have the house all to ourselves , wo n't we , child . Have you seen the veranda ? It 's my very favorite spot in this cozy cliffside aerie Charlotte has inherited from her French relatives . I daresay , the prospect of inheriting a veranda such this is would be reason enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arm . Charlotte points them toward the door . CHARLOTTE Town is that way . DELLAMAR You 'll need a sweater , my darling . Why do n't you pick one up at your cottage and I 'll meet you there . p. 20 GEORGEANNE All right . Georgeanne goes out the door . After she has gone . DELLAMAR My darling Charlotte , I do n't think I have ever seen you so upset . CHARLOTTE I 'm not upset . DELLAMAR You are . You are still beautiful . And I still adore you . But you are caught in some thicket or other , and I do n't like it . But I assume that when you are ready to be rescued you will call out , and I will come find you . CHARLOTTE I do n't want to be rescued . DELLAMAR I said when . Did n't I say when ? Is it young Romeo ? CHARLOTTE Did you sleep with Georgeanne ? DELLAMAR Why does it matter ? CHARLOTTE Because I do n't want her to fall in love with you . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Savannah when she goes . DELLAMAR And how do you intend to accomplish that ? CHARLOTTE But that is why I invited you here . So you could help me . DELLAMAR Why , what an amusing little project . Surely that is n't the only reason you invited me here . But I would be delighted to offer my assistance . p. 21 CHARLOTTE Oh Randall . What would I do without you . DELLAMAR Then we will see you at lunch . CHARLOTTE That you will . He leaves . Charlotte stands there a moment . Suddenly Cab appears in the door to the veranda , holding something behind his back . CAB Please forgive me , Charlotte . She turns around . CHARLOTTE Forgive you . CAB I accuse you of not caring for me at all , I 'm rude to that poor girl , I charge off ready to kill Randall DellaMar on sight , and then what do I find waiting for me just inside my door ? This . CHARLOTTE A poem . CAB ( reading the poem ) In the darkness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having no idea how far down it is , only that you are there. But how steep it is , or by what path or even if I may return , I have no way know . And so I pray the ground will tilt and tip me over this fine stable edge.I would know what draws me to you . I would fall if falling is how you bid me come.Wait there . A moment . CAB You do love me . You do . p. 22 CHARLOTTE I did n't write that . CAB But- CHARLOTTE It was Georgeanne , I 'm sure . CAB But this is a love poem . CHARLOTTE Yes . It sounds to me as if she 's fallen in love with you . CAB She ca n't be in love with me . She 's known me for one day , in which I behaved very badly toward her . CHARLOTTE I 'll have to send her home , I guess . CAB This poem is so overt . The poor girl holds nothing back . CHARLOTTE She does n't know how to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inexperienced and this attraction to you has caught her ( a moment ) quite off guard . CAB " I would know what draws me to you . I would fall if falling is how you bid me come . Wait there ? " I think she 's offering herself to me . CHARLOTTE That is how it sounds . CHARLOTTE They 'll be back here for lunch . Now promise me you wo n't embarrass her with Randall . You wo n't wave this poem around like it was- But Cab continues to study the poem . p. 23 CAB I ca n't even make out the geography of this silly poem . Wait where ? What , I 'm standing down below her on a ledge and she 's up above on the cliff and she 's going to jump and- CHARLOTTE You 're on the sand , I think . At the water 's edge , maybe . CAB I think I 'm at the mouth of some cave about half way down . But what am I supposed to do , reach out and grab her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forget all about this poem . Just put it in your pocket and when you see her , talk about how you spent the whole morning outside and she 'll just assume you have n't seen it yet . Or I could tell her I walked past your cottage and saw the poem and read it and thought maybe she should have it back . CAB And why would you do that ? CHARLOTTE Because you are mine , of course . CAB Your what . CHARLOTTE My lover , my companion , my dear dear- CAB She did n't write this poem . You wrote this poem and are passing it off as hers because you think it will make me fall in love with her and you wo n't have to hurt me . I think you 're trying to get rid of me CHARLOTTE Well I guess it 's easy enough to find out who wrote the poem . You can simply ask her when she comes up for lunch and then you can watch her sob for the rest of the day . p. 24 CAB And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? CHARLOTTE Because you would have rejected her without even so much as a moment of real attention . Maybe you do n't understand how provocative you are to someone like Georgeanne . CAB Maybe I do n't care . CHARLOTTE Of course if you did ply her with your- CAB I do n't intend to ply her with anything of mine . I do n't think the word ply is appropriate here . CHARLOTTE I only meant , if you did make love to her , well , I do n't expect it would be very interesting for you , given how little she knows about pleasing a man , but it could be catastrophic to her , given that for the rest of her life , she 's not likely ever again to have a man as- He takes her in his arms . He may laugh a little , but he 's beginning to be affected by this flattery . CAB As what . As demanding as I am ? CHARLOTTE As splendid , as inspired , as tender and generous a lover as you are . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to seduce her . CHARLOTTE Maybe I just appreciate how intoxicated she is. p. 25 CAB That 's ridiculous . CHARLOTTE When she talks about you , she can barely breathe . CAB And when I talk about you , I can barely breathe . So there we are . There is a moment . CHARLOTTE My darling boy , look at the time . CAB I 'm not a boy . Stop calling me a boy . She picks up her sweater and purse . CHARLOTTE Why sweetheart , I have been calling you a boy ever since I met you . CAB Well , I do n't like it . Where are you going ? Are you going into town ? CHARLOTTE If I 'm to have any kind of lunch ready , I need to pick up a few things , yes . CAB I want to go with you . CHARLOTTE I know you do . But I so love to surprise you with what I 've found . And how can I surprise you if you 're right there with me , now is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . How does that sound ? With a garnish of some sort , and bread of course , and lamb . Randall loves lamb . CAB Can you organize the table so I do n't have to see him ? I hate how much he knows about you . p. 26 CHARLOTTE How can he help it , darling . We 've been friends for all our lives . CAB Were you lovers ? Was he your first lover ? CHARLOTTE Stop torturing yourself . I have told you- CAB I will torture myself when and where I please . She laughs . CHARLOTTE Maybe it would be best if you did n't join us for lunch . We could go out in the boat later . Just the two of us . CAB Do you have someone else ? In the town . Are you in love with that fisherman who brings you the big brill ? CHARLOTTE Oh I may have been . On the odd morning . CAB Please let me come with you . What if you need me to carry something ? CHARLOTTE I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm going for a swim . CHARLOTTE What a perfect idea . Lunch is about two . CAB Come with me , Charlotte . It is n't safe to swim alone . CHARLOTTE Two o'clock , my sweet . Charlotte and Cab leave by opposite doors , he taking the door to the veranda , she taking the door that leads down the stone steps and into the town. @x Georgeanne and Randall come back in the house , their arms filled with flowers . She stops , examining the bouquet . GEORGEANNE Sometimes I think I would have been so much happier had I been born a lilac . DELLAMAR Now surely , child , you ca n't mean a single lilac blossom . I can easily imagine a life as a lilac tree , but not a single blossom . Why it would be so fleeting . And while fleeting is a sweet quality , I would n't want it to be the only one I had .

I had always hoped that Charlotte could teach me everything she knows about seeming enchanting and interesting . DELLAMAR Why Georgeanne . Are you suggesting that our divine Charlotte 's demeanor is a mere device ? p. 28 GEORGEANNE But it must be . Otherwise , how can she have lived so long and be so pleasant . By the time I am her age , if things go on as they are now , I can not imagine even being able to speak , so deep will be my misery . DELLAMAR Are you miserable at this very moment ?

He simply takes the opportunity for a little mischief . DELLAMAR Not even the beauty of young men . GEORGEANNE Especially not young men . DELLAMAR Come now . Surely you must have some response to Charlotte 's young man , Cab . Let me hear your thoughts on him . p. 29 GEORGEANNE He is beautiful . Yes . DELLAMAR Now see there ! We have an exception already . But if you find him beautiful , is n't it possible there are others ? GEORGEANNE But he is not like the others . He is like something from the natural world . Like something growing with abandon on a craggy hillside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a crashing sea .

CAB What 's all this ? DELLAMAR Young man . You have forgotten your clothing . CAB I 'm sorry . I had no idea anyone was up here . DELLAMAR On the contrary . You came here expressly to show yourself to Georgeanne . Did n't you . CAB Would you hand me a towel ? DELLAMAR I will not . I believe you have a cottage of your own just down the path , and I suggest you proceed there apace . But Georgeanne has taken a towel from the kitchen and now walks to him , looking down . p. 30 GEORGEANNE Here you are . CAB Thank you .

Finally , he decides she is probably demented , but nonetheless serious and begins to dry off . CAB I was angry . DELLAMAR If you children will excuse me , I think I 'll go anywhere else . Neither of them even seem to have heard him . Randall leaves . CAB ( moving toward the stairs ) I need to put on some dry clothes . GEORGEANNE Would you like me to leave ? I know you do n't like me .

She is silent . p. 32 CAB Is this an old poem , or did you write it recently ? Why did you leave it for me ? Still she does n't speak . CAB Did you write it for me ? Christ , girl . What is the matter with you ? Why do you not speak ? GEORGEANNE I am afraid of you . CAB Of me . GEORGEANNE I 'm afraid I will say the wrong thing . CAB People often say the wrong thing . GEORGEANNE But I do n't want to . CAB Then let 's not talk about the poem . Let 's talk about something else . GEORGEANNE All right . He comes toward her . She still ca n't quite look around . He is like a spider examining something in its web . CAB Did you sleep with Randall DellaMar ? Charlotte thinks you slept with him . GEORGEANNE I do n't sleep with people . CAB And why not ? GEORGEANNE I 'm afraid . CAB I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But it 's what I tell myself . p. 33 CAB When was the last time you were with a man ? GEORGEANNE It was a long time ago . CAB How long ago , George ? GEORGEANNE No one calls me George . CAB I like it , actually . Like George Sand . Or George Eliot . George is a good name for a girl . GEORGEANNE ( brightening for some reason ) I know a woman named Claude . He comes closer to her . She does n't move . CAB And this woman named Claude ? Would I like her ? GEORGEANNE I do n't know . What kind of woman do you like ? CAB I like the kind who are very still . GEORGEANNE Because they are n't running away ? CAB Because they are able to be still . Your stillness , for example , lets me look at you . GEORGEANNE I 'm not doing this to try to pull you toward me . I tried to leave with Randall . I just could n't . It 's like one of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but your feet wo n't move . CAB Do you dream of monsters ? p. 34 GEORGEANNE Almost every night . CAB How close do the monsters come ? GEORGEANNE I can feel their skin . I do n't touch it , but I can feel it . CAB Is it scaly and rough ? GEORGEANNE No . It 's smooth and cold . I can feel their thoughts . CAB They think through their skin ? GEORGEANNE What they are thinking comes to me through their skin . CAB And can you do this with people as well ? GEORGEANNE ( stricken ) Do what ? CAB Touch their skin and tell what they are feeling . GEORGEANNE I do n't know . CAB But I have a lot of skin , really , spread over my whole body . Would you know different aspects of mywould you know various things I was thinking depending on which parts of my skin you were touching ? She does n't answer . CAB George ? GEORGEANNE Maybe if you walked out to the veranda , I would be able to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave . GEORGEANNE What do you want . CAB I want you to touch me . GEORGEANNE Where ? He walks around in front of her , pulls his robe off his shoulders so it falls down around his waist . She looks away . CAB George . GEORGEANNE ( still looking away ) Yes ? CAB I 'm over here . She turns finally to look at him . And at precisely that point Charlotte enters . CHARLOTTE Good gracious . What is going on in here ? Georgeanne moves quickly to the other side of the room . Cab follows her with his eyes , not pulling his robe back up . GEORGEANNE Charlotte ! Oh Charlotte ! Cab is not the slightest bit embarrassed by this . In fact , he seems quite determined to continue in his rebel mode . CAB George was telling me she could tell people 's thoughts by feeling their skin . I was trying to get her to show me how she did it . Randall enters . p. 36 DELLAMAR Charlotte , promise me your young man will dress for lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lunch , Randall . I ca n't quite tell whether he 's coming or going . Randall notices Georgeanne has again lapsed into her frozen state . DELLAMAR But surely we ca n't be expected to eat while he exposes himself to Georgeanne . CAB I 'll go change . Cab turns quickly and goes past Randall and out the door . Charlotte watches Georgeanne . CHARLOTTE What on earth happened here , child ? DELLAMAR You know very well what it was , Charlotte . GEORGEANNE He was playing with me like I was a bug . Like I was a lightning bug he would put in a Mason jar and punch holes in the lid and set on his dresser and watch me til I died . CHARLOTTE Oh now . Georgeanne sits down in the chair . Randall is highly amused . DELLAMAR Georgeanne does have a rather intermittent glow , I must say . One moment glittering , the next barely even visible . Georgeanne is back out of the chair . p. 37 GEORGEANNE Now you 're doing it too ! I did n't come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLOTTE He 's not laughing at you , Georgeanne . DELLAMAR Yes I am , a little . You seduced that boy with such consummate ease it 's actually laughable . GEORGEANNE I did n't seduce him . DELLAMAR You knew he was at the window , you purposefully said that delicious business about the newborn thing erupting from the sea GEORGEANNE I did not ! DELLAMAR I 'm sorry you missed it Charlotte . It was a masterpiece . Bold and young , I 'll admit . But the sheer wildness of her scheme was irresistible to him . Why he could barely walk across the room . I think you 'd better send Miss Georgeanne home if you intend to keep young Romeo on the staff . GEORGEANNE This is an outrage . Charlotte , make him stop this ! CHARLOTTE He 's teasing you , dear . Georgeanne walks toward the door . CHARLOTTE Where are you going ? GEORGEANNE I do n't know . DELLAMAR Why she 's going to find Cab , of course . p. 38 GEORGEANNE I 'm going home . CHARLOTTE But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let them treat me this way ? Cab reenters , dressed beautifully . Randall resumes his good manners . DELLAMAR There he is . Good then . Our table is complete . Cab goes over to Charlotte . He too seems ready for a polite meal . CAB Hello , Charlotte . How was town ? Now I see the asparagus , but where is the lamb ? What 's in this package ? It would n't be fish would it ? CHARLOTTE Cab likes to torment himself with the idea that I am in love with a local fisherman . DELLAMAR But Charlotte , you 've always loved working men , have n't you dear . Something about their rough hands , is n't that what you said ? Cab loses whatever resolve he had to be polite . CAB Excuse me , sir , but I think you are the most despicable man I have ever met . CHARLOTTE Cab ! How could you ? GEORGEANNE But I agree . Everything he says is mean . He embarrasses people just to watch them squirm . DELLAMAR ( laughing ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this boy . Abandon hope , young man . She has you in her sights . Charlotte is simply so tickled by this she ca n't stand it . She knows she should defend Georgeanne , but she doesn't. p. 39 CHARLOTTE Oh Randall , be nice to the children . CAB What is he doing here ? CHARLOTTE Do n't take this so seriously , Cab . He 's making me laugh . CAB At my expense . GEORGEANNE And mine . CHARLOTTE Come now . We ca n't have any quarreling . It will spoil our lunch . GEORGEANNE I 'm not hungry . DELLAMAR And she mounts the final assault . " I 'm not hungry . " GEORGEANNE Charlotte ! Make him stop this ! CAB Come on , George . Let 's get out of here . DELLAMAR mock indignationWhere are you two going ? Georgeanne starts to say something , but Cab takes her arm . CAB Do n't answer . Let 's just go . CHARLOTTE I must know where you are going . ( he keeps going ) Cabot Gray ! CAB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the door . There is a moment of stillness , then a smile breaks over Charlotte 's face . p. 40 CHARLOTTE Randall DellaMar , you were perfect . DELLAMAR And we are free at last . Truly , I despise the young . CHARLOTTE Oh , they have their moments . Are you hungry ? DELLAMAR Starving . But not for fish . I hope it 's not fish . ( he unwraps the package ) Aha . Lamb it is . I love lamb . Now what do I get for my part in that delightful charade . CHARLOTTE Why the opportunity to keep amusing me , of course . DELLAMAR And how might I do that . CHARLOTTE All I want , Randall , is for you to spend this lunch madly in love with me . DELLAMAR I see , very good . And will Madame be requiring sex as well ? CHARLOTTE You are so funny . She continues setting the table . DELLAMAR Do n't tell me you 're tired of sex . CHARLOTTE Maybe . DELLAMAR You 're not tired of sex . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CHARLOTTE And who are you having sex with ? p. 41 DELLAMAR Well , let 's see . There 's the bridge club , of course , and the museum board , and the new gorilla girl at the zoo CHARLOTTE I see . DELLAMAR I 'm supposed to say she 's a promising primatologist but gorilla girl keeps coming out of my mouth . CHARLOTTE Well I want to hear all about it . DELLAMAR And then you 'll tell me about this fisherman young Cab is so jealous of ? CHARLOTTE I will tell you every single thing . You pour the wine , I 'll finish the salads . He pours the wine , then sets the bottle in the bucket and pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket . DELLAMAR Charlotte . I wonder if you know anything about this poem I found under my door . CHARLOTTE Someone wrote you a poem ? Randall unfolds the poem and reads . DELLAMAR The day was warm , and we took a picnic out to the point.I do n't remember which of us packed the lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked of as we walked.Or if we walked , if truth be told , or if the day was warmor if , in fact , we went at all.Maybe I only went to remember such a day . Maybe I have taken to making up my memories , writing down the days I did not live.I fear the music I hear now is coming from a dance I did not attend.But I wanted to ask you . Did you go ? And if you did , what was it like ? Charlotte takes in the poem . Then responds somewhat casually as she finishes putting out the food . p. 42 CHARLOTTE Well that 's a sad little poem . DELLAMAR I think you wrote this . CHARLOTTE Oh , I have n't written anything for some time , Randall . And I have never written poetry . DELLAMAR And why is that , may I ask ? Charlotte looks at the table . CHARLOTTE Why because I love poetry above all things , of course , and I 've been afraid to try it . There now . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pleasant lunch was one of the great lost arts . He puts the poem in his pocket . DELLAMAR My mother always said if people wanted to have sex , they should repair to the bedroom before the meal , rather than after . He comes very close to her . We can feel the attraction . CHARLOTTE We ca n't become lovers now , Randall . Why it would spoil everything . DELLAMAR ( after a moment ) All right , then . Shall we ? He holds out her chair for her . DELLAMAR Here you are . CHARLOTTE Thank you , sweetheart . He goes over to his side of the table , sits down and picks up his glass . p. 43 DELLAMAR What a charming little house this is . So private . Why a person could be quite happy here . CHARLOTTE Indeed . They raise their glasses. @x Charlotte sits at her desk looking over a piece of paper . She holds a pen , but it 's not clear whether she 's reading or writing . She pours herself a glass of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of flowers . He has been drinking , but he does not slur his words or weave around the room . He is simply less vigilant about what he says . And though his clothes are a wreck and he is barefoot , he is trying to hold it together . Charlotte hears him and turns around . CHARLOTTE There you are , handsome man . CAB I thought you ought to have some posies . She stands . CHARLOTTE And look how beautiful they are . How was your lunch with Georgeanne ? CAB Edible . CHARLOTTE What did you have ? She puts the piece of paper in her pocket and takes the flowers . CAB I forget . What is that ? CHARLOTTE Just a note . CAB From whom . No do n't tell me . It 's from Randall DellaMar. ( making up the note ) " Charlotte , my peach , it is time for you to dispatch this sex slave of yours , and take care of a crabby old man til he dies . " p. 45 CHARLOTTE ( affectionately ) And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no idea . Where is the old bastard , by the way ? CHARLOTTE Taking a nap . Where is Georgeanne ? CAB She left . CHARLOTTE What do you mean , left ? CAB She packed up her gear and decamped for America . CHARLOTTE Are you sure she 's not in your bed in your cottage ? CAB Well that 's one place you 'll never go , so how will you know ? CHARLOTTE I think something happened to you in town . I think she rejected you . CAB Oh on the contrary . CHARLOTTE I see . CAB ( a moment ) Well are n't you going to ask ? Is it beneath you to be curious ? I would think since you arranged this indiscretion you 'd at least want to know how it turned out . CHARLOTTE Ask you what , if you had a nice time ? I expect you did , being two beautiful people on a perfect afternoon . It appears that she has lost interest . She goes into the kitchen area . p. 46 CAB Do you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it might have been private . Not the sort of thing one should tell . CAB I will tell you what happened , but I insist that you ask me for this information , Charlotte . As a gentleman , I can not reveal the sordid details of another 's personal life unless pressed . CHARLOTTE You slept with her . CAB She slept with me is more like it . He sinks into the chair , as if in complete defeat . She keeps looking at him , but does n't move any closer . He does n't look at her . CAB And you do n't even care . CHARLOTTE I did n't say that . CAB ( lashes out ) She 's beautiful . Her French is perfect . I had fun walking around with her , being mad at you . We sat outside and laughed and at and drank til we could barely stand up . It was hopeless . Finally she wanted me so much , I just gave in . CHARLOTTE You do n't have to confess this kind of thing , Cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like liquid . Her whole body was like some kind of melted , I do n't know , I felt like I could make her into whatever I wanted , whatever I needed , move her however I wanted her to move , put her wherever I wanted her . She had no idea what she was doing , it was all for me . It was all about me. p. 47 CHARLOTTE About you . CAB And it 's all your fault . CHARLOTTE So have I lost you , then . CAB Oh do n't look so proud of yourself . If you wanted me to make love to somebody else so I would know what I was missing , it did n't work . I was thinking of you the whole time . ( a moment ) Or if you wanted me to be unfaithful so you would n't feel guilty about your fisherman , that wo n't work either . Have him , if you want . As long as you still love me , Charlotte . Now tell both of these intruders to be on their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She does n't answer . She takes a drink of water . He gets up now . CAB Do n't tell me I have to screw Randall DellaMar too . Is that why you invited him ? And precisely on cue , Randall appears in the doorway of her bedroom . Dressed , but not so completely as before lunch . He is holding his shoes . CAB Oh for pity 's sake . DELLAMAR For your information , young man , I 've been screwed for pity before . And believe me , it is not to be missed . CAB What 's he doing here ? CHARLOTTE Randall was taking a nap , darling . I told you . p. 48 DELLAMAR Oh now Charlotte . Surely you do n't expect him to believe that . Why he should have known better than to leave us alone with our lovely wine and our longing for each other . CHARLOTTE Shame on you , Randall . DELLAMAR I was taking a nap so I would be fresh for whatever entertainment the evening held in store . CAB ( lashing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cottage for your nap ? DELLAMAR I did n't want to miss anything , that 's why . Charlotte said you 'd promised to take her on a boating excursion this afternoon . I was hoping I might tag along . I love the sight of the sky from the water . I always have . I suppose it comes from growing up in a landlocked state . CAB You would trust yourself in a boat with me ? DELLAMAR Of course I would . Throwin ' me overboard would ruin any chance you 'd ever have with Charlotte , not that you have much after your escapade this afternoon with young Georgeanne . CAB ( resigned ) You were listening , of course . DELLAMAR I 'm a light sleeper . But I must say it sounds as if you acquitted yourself rather well , except on moral and ethical grounds , of course . Charlotte picks up her purse from the counter . Cab recognizes the signs . p. 49 CAB Where are you going ? CHARLOTTE Just out to pick up a few things for supper . CAB @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had any sense , Cabernet , we 'd go talk to this fisherman ourselves , find out what he 's got that our Charlotte has to have some of every day . CHARLOTTE Why do n't the two of you go out in the boat ? CAB All right , Randall . Since I ca n't get Charlotte to leave the house with me , I 'll take you out in the boat if you want . Do you want to go to the beach ? DELLAMAR I would enjoy that very much . They start toward the door . CHARLOTTE Good then , we 'll see both of you for supper . Drinks about eight . CAB Who is we ? You said we 'll see you for supper . Charlotte flashes the note . CHARLOTTE Why Georgeanne , of course . She left me a note . CAB You knew Georgeanne did n't go back to America ? CHARLOTTE She says she 's gone off to visit an old tatter she met when she visited me last year . p. 50 CAB What the hell is a tatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boy . Now I think we better go before you get in any deeper . ( they start to go ) For one thing , when talking to southern women , you must never reveal your ignorance of textiles . They go out the door . Charlotte walks to the closet and gets her coat . Georgeanne knocks at a window . Charlotte goes over the window and opens it . GEORGEANNE Are they gone ? CHARLOTTE Georgeanne ! I did n't expect you back so soon . Could n't you find the tatter 's house ? GEORGEANNE I got halfway there and I turned around . I have to talk to you . I do n't want you to be mad at me . CHARLOTTE Yes ? GEORGEANNE I know you said you wanted to give Cab to me , but after lunch today , we stopped in his cottage and before I quite knew what was happening , he had all my clothes off and was ravishing me . CHARLOTTE Yes , I know . He told me . GEORGEANNE I do n't mean that he started it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just could n't stop him , or myself either . Are you mad ? Please do n't be mad . p. 51 CHARLOTTE No , no . I would like nothing better than for you to take Cab with you when you leave . GEORGEANNE Is he here ? CHARLOTTE He 's taken Randall down to the beach . GEORGEANNE And where are you off to ? CHARLOTTE Just down into town to get some things for supper . GEORGEANNE Can I come ? CHARLOTTE No . GEORGEANNE Why not ? CHARLOTTE Because I like to buy vegetables by myself . GEORGEANNE You 're going to see your fisherman , are n't you ? CHARLOTTE Yes . GEORGEANNE Can I meet him ? CHARLOTTE No . GEORGEANNE Charlotte , if you 're in love with him , I want to meet him . I mean , I know there must be something wrong with him or you would n't keep him such a secret . But whatever it is , it 's all right with me . CHARLOTTE I see . GEORGEANNE ( unable to contain her excitement ) But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and treat you like a fishwife ? p. 52 CHARLOTTE No . GEORGEANNE Is his hair thick with salt and his face brown from the sun ? Is he the man Cab showed me at the dock ? CHARLOTTE Probably . I know Cab  - -  follows me sometimes . Oh GEORGEANNE Lean and rugged and handsome , with a lot of hair ? Stay there . I left your bicycle on the path . I have to hear more . Do n't go yet . Do you promise ? Resigned to more conversation , Charlotte takes off her jacket . CHARLOTTE All right . I 'll go change . But ten minutes . And then I have to go . Georgeanne starts to go , then runs back onstage . GEORGEANNE The man at the dock looked so demanding . I see why you love him . I do . He 's so authentic and male . After a moment . CHARLOTTE ( to herself ) @x Randall and Cab walk toward the boat . CAB Just tell me one thing . DELLAMAR ( a moment ) Yes . I can swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What is the matter with you ? DELLAMAR You asked me to tell you one thing . So I did . I even told you something that seemed appropriate given that I doubt there are any life preservers in your vessel . CAB What does Charlotte want ? DELLAMAR What makes you think I know that ? And what makes you think I would tell you if I did ? CAB Does she want to get married ? DELLAMAR No , no . She 's been married . CAB Has she talked to you about the fisherman ? DELLAMAR Not much . CAB So it 's him . It 's him she wants . DELLAMAR Possibly . When women are silent about something , that 's usually it . CAB So what do you have to do , figure out what a woman is n't saying ? What kind of ludicrous pursuit is that ? p. 54 DELLAMAR Unfortunately , it is the one that matters . CAB But there must be countless thousands of things a woman is n't saying . DELLAMAR Yes , but you do n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're curious about . Ask Charlotte what she wants . It 's an unusual approach , I 'll grant you , but women like to be asked questions . CAB Even personal questions ? DELLAMAR Especially personal questions . They like to be asked what they did that day . About their families . About where they got that little music box on their dressing table . CAB Are you gay ? DELLAMAR No . CAB Are you sure ? DELLAMAR What makes you think I 'm gay ? Because I like women and know how to talk to them ? CAB I thought if you were gay , Charlotte would n't leave me for you . DELLAMAR Oh far from it . If Charlotte wanted to spend the rest of her life with me , it would n't matter whether I was gay or not . Life is not about sex . CAB Is that so ? DELLAMAR Hell , boy . Not even sex is about sex . Life is about companionship and pleasure . Whereas sex is about isolation . About the awful emptiness inside of us. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELLAMAR No , I know . Sex can be riveting . Make you feel like a damn god . But I also know that even when you have as much sex as you can stand in one night , you still feel empty again in the morning . CAB So you just have sex again in the morning , Jesus . DELLAMAR It does n't matter how much sex you have , it does n't do for us what we think it will . As fond of it as we are , sex just does n't work . It will not meet our desperate need for union . It will not release us from our separateness , and it will not put us in genuine contact with another human being . For instance , did you ever try to tell Charlotte something by making love to her ? CAB All the time . DELLAMAR And does she get it ? CAB No . DELLAMAR See ? It is n't your fault . You 're a fine boy . CAB I 'm not a boy . DELLAMAR But she is lonely in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone too far . CAB And you do , is that right . p. 56 DELLAMAR Possibly . CAB ( getting angry ) You snake . I almost believed you were doing me some kind of favor , telling me some things about her to help me understand her better . But this is all a trick to get me to give her up . DELLAMAR I would like to see you give her up . And I think she would too . CAB Then why does n't she just tell me to go ? I would n't stay where I was n't wanted . But she has n't said that , or anything like that . You think I 'm an idiot , but I 'm not . DELLAMAR I do n't actually . I think you are a very promising young poet . CAB You 've read my poetry ? DELLAMAR This last one , about the loose mad gloryI particularly liked that one . CAB Charlotte read you the poem I wrote for her last night ? DELLAMAR This one I found on the dressing table . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlotte 's quit writing . She 's living now . That 's what she says . DELLAMAR Is that right . Randall pulls a piece of paper out of his pocket . p. 57 CAB What is that ? DELLAMAR A poem I found in my cottage . I thought it might be one of yours . CAB I did n't leave you any poem . DELLAMAR Well , then . If Charlotte 's quit writing , as you say , then I guess this is from Georgeanne. ( makes him wait a moment ) Would you care to read it ? CAB I would . Randall hands Cab the piece of paper . Cab reads to himself , then reads the last section aloud . CAB I fear the music I hear now is coming from a dance I did not attend.But I wanted to ask you . Did you go ? And if you did , what was it like ? DELLAMAR It does n't sound like Georgeanne . CAB No . It 's hers . Charlotte wrote that for you . DELLAMAR Yes , I guess she did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Georgeanne enters out of breath . GEORGEANNE Oh good , you 're still here . CHARLOTTE That 's all right . Catch your breath now . p. 58 GEORGEANNE My life is just running away from me today , and I 'm havin ' a hard time keepin ' up . CHARLOTTE All your days should be like this . Not like any day you ever lived before , with surprises at every turn . GEORGEANNE I want to live just like you do . Books you wrote everywhere , prizes you won piled up in the corners . Good things to eat , handsome men to make love to , and beautiful paper for writing it all down . CHARLOTTE Georgeanne , I do n't want you to think you have to write in order to matter as a person.Writing 's really just for people who have no other choice . GEORGEANNE I do n't want to talk about me . CHARLOTTE And I want you to know that Cab is ready to be married , if you are in love with him , as I believe you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about him . I love his soft hair and the soles of his feet . CHARLOTTE Yes . Good then . GEORGEANNE Is your fisherman CHARLOTTE Georgeanne GEORGEANNE Is he your favorite of all your lovers ? p. 59 CHARLOTTE I do n't want to  --  GEORGEANNE Maybe he 's not a lover yet . Is that why you 're so eager to get rid of Cab , so you can have your first night together up here at the top of the cliff under the stars ? CHARLOTTE Jean-Luc is not a lover . GEORGEANNE ( gasps at the romantic name ) His name is Jean-Luc ? But my God , Charlotte , what are you waiting for ? Are you worried that he will be swept out to sea and your heart will be broken , and when you take off your widow 's wear , your hair will be stark white and you will be an old woman who sits at the pier and is pitied by the passersby ? CHARLOTTE No . GEORGEANNE He 's not married , is he ? CHARLOTTE He is married , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast in a square wooden house that sits on stilts , and he has to get back there every night to care for her because at the birth of their seventh child , she fell ill , and when the wind rattles the house , the child , a girl , cries cold and unconsoled . CHARLOTTE ( beginning to resent this ) Why I go to see Jean-Luc is my own private affair . p. 60 GEORGEANNE But how am I to learn how to conduct myself if you do n't tell me everything ? CHARLOTTE This is not something you have to know . GEORGEANNE Because I ca n't comprehend the majesty of it , the monumental maturity of it ? Is what you have with this man so beyond me that you do n't even want me to know it exists ? Charlotte looks at her for a moment . CHARLOTTE It 's not what you think . GEORGEANNE ( wo n't quit ) If you are giving up Cab for this man , what else can I think ? CHARLOTTE I go to see this man because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know you could eat jellyfish . What do they taste like ? CHARLOTTE These are poisonous . I need to go . GEORGEANNE Then she should n't eat them . CHARLOTTE She does n't eat them . Her nurse makes a salve out of the toxin . GEORGEANNE You mean like a miracle cure ? CHARLOTTE Or a folk medicine . GEORGEANNE But is it working ? Is it keeping her alive ? Who is this aunt ? p. 61 CHARLOTTE Her name is Frances . I call her Frances . But for some reason , all her sisters called her Bunny . GEORGEANNE Can I meet Aunt Bunny ? I like the elderly . CHARLOTTE No . She wo n't see anyone but me . And I do n't want you telling anyone about her . GEORGEANNE But why does it have to be a secret ? CHARLOTTE ( getting irritated ) It 's not a secret , it 's private . GEORGEANNE But we could all help . We could make a soup for her and find perfect pears to poach for a compote . CHARLOTTE What you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what is important to me without any distractions . Now . I do n't want you to ask me any more questions about it . I will see you at supper and I want your word you will not tell Cab or Randall . GEORGEANNE I understand . CHARLOTTE All right , then . Charlotte goes out the door . Georgeanne walks around a moment , then goes out the door . AT THE HOUSE A LITTLE WHILE LATER Randall and Cab are stunned by Georgeanne 's news . Randall is so outraged , he is practically shrieking . p. 62 DELLAMAR Charlotte has an Aunt Bunny ? I never heard of Aunt Bunny . CAB And neither have I. GEORGEANNE She 's going to kill me for telling you . CAB It 's not true . She made it all up . It was a trick . DELLAMAR And a very dishonorable one . A person can not simply make up relatives in order to rid herself of admirers . CAB Rid herself of admirers ? GEORGEANNE Charlotte wants all of us to go home so she can take care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the matter with Aunt Bunny ? I refuse to call anyone Aunt Bunny . What is the woman 's given name , did she tell you ? GEORGEANNE Frances . DELLAMAR That 's better . ( then suddenly ) Not Frances the old Countess ? GEORGEANNE The old Countess ? DELLAMAR When Charlotte was a girl , she loved to tell stories about Aunt Frances the old Countess , who had grown up in a convent , then fallen in love with the boy who brought bread to the convent . But this boy turned out to be the son of a Count who was falsely accused of treason and imprisoned at LaTour . So Frances and the boy ran away together to try to free the Count , but they were forced into hiding by an evil Sheriff and on and on . p. 63 CAB Frances is not a real person . She 's a character in a book Charlotte was working on . She 's told me most of it . DELLAMAR She 's told you it was a book ? Has she shown you this book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course it 's a book . Nobody grows up in convents anymore . But did she finish this book ? How do the boy and girl live while they are in hiding ? Do they sleep in the stables and does she steal eggs and sell them during the day , and does he have sex with rich widows for money to buy his father 's freedom ? DELLAMAR Where are you going ? Cab starts for the door . CAB I know where Charlotte goes after she visits the fisherman . I 've followed her a couple of times . I 'll just go there and knock on the door and see for myself . If she 's sitting with her aunt , I 'll apologize . If she 's in bed with the fisherman , I 'll kill them . GEORGEANNE ( rushing after him ) Cab ! No ! DELLAMAR I think I 'd better come along . GEORGEANNE No , no . You can stay behind , Randall . I 'll accompany Cab to make sure he does n't lose his head . p. 64 DELLAMAR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past your cottage , Georgeanne , I 'll come collect you both in time for supper . CAB Why would n't we make it past Georgeanne 's cottage ? DELLAMAR Did n't she say she had to stop to get a sweater ? GEORGEANNE I did , thank you , Randall . DELLAMAR And while she 's changing her clothes , you 'll have a glass of wine . And one thing will lead to another . CAB Is this a warning or a suggestion , Randall ? DELLAMAR Perhaps a little of both . CAB You do n't want me to interrupt the two of them , is that it ? You want me to get distracted by Georgeanne so I do n't burst in on Charlotte and the fisherman . GEORGEANNE Jean-Luc . CAB That 's his name ? DELLAMAR Have you ever walked in on anyone making love ? CAB No . DELLAMAR It 's not as much fun as you think . Cab and Georgeanne look at each other . DELLAMAR But if you 're determined to go , there 's no sense in my trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let 's get your sweater . She starts to walk off with Cab , then runs back in . GEORGEANNE Randall , promise me you wo n't breathe a word to Charlotte about what I told you . Do you swear ? DELLAMAR Fine . Fine . I wo n't tell . Cab and Georgeanne leave. @x Randall is working on his painting as Charlotte enters . CHARLOTTE Hello there . DELLAMAR And hello to you , my sweet peach . CHARLOTTE Where is everyone ? DELLAMAR Right here , as far as I 'm concerned . CHARLOTTE And Cab and Georgeanne ? DELLAMAR They 've gone down to the village to try to catch you with your fisherman . CHARLOTTE I see . DELLAMAR Charlotte , I hope this is n't just some game you 're playing . I mean , I hope you really want to be rid of young Cab because Georgeanne can be quite determined in her romantic pursuits . In that way , she is a lot like her mother . CHARLOTTE I want Georgeanne to take Cab home . He 's not a poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to be happy , I do . I just do n't want him here . DELLAMAR ( grandly ) Because you are tired of love . CHARLOTTE I am . Are n't you ? Honestly now . Do n't you just want to weep for all the time you 've lost looking into someone else 's hopeful eyes . p. 67 DELLAMAR But it 's provided you with so much entertainment over the years , not to mention material for those finely wrought novels . CHARLOTTE That may be , but now I intend to abandon romance altogether , step out of it like an organza dancing dress I can leave on the floor of my closet , close the door and walk away . DELLAMAR But what mourning there will be among your admirers . CHARLOTTE Well I have finished with that , as I said . And now , and this is why I have called you here DELLAMAR At last . CHARLOTTE You must help me resist the temptation to hold onto Cab , whose heart is true , and whose body gives me pleasure I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fear or jealousy or even just sheer habit , give him what is most precious to me . CHARLOTTE The time I have remaining on this fair earth . DELLAMAR So . You are not tired of everything , just love . CHARLOTTE Actually , everything else seems particularly sweet . Books and walks and sleep . After Cab leaves , I may even arrange flowers and drink tea . DELLAMAR And how long do you think you will be amused by reading and walking and drinking tea ? p. 68 CHARLOTTE I should expect quite a while , Randall . There are novelists , most of them living in the Southern hemisphere , and China , of course , whose names I do n't even know yet . And countless poets whose work I have not read . DELLAMAR ( very grandly ) Yes yes . There are many paths not taken , not to mention naps . CHARLOTTE I want to be alone , Randall ! I want to do what people do when they 're alone . DELLAMAR You mean call somebody ? CHARLOTTE ( beginning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELLAMAR Because I love you , Charlotte , and I know you would n't give up this boy if you were n't in trouble somehow . Are you ill ? CHARLOTTE No , I am quite well . DELLAMAR Then I insist you tell me what it is . CHARLOTTE Oh all right , if you must know . Aunt Frances is dying . DELLAMAR Aunt Frances the old Countess you made up ? Charlotte is quiet a moment . CHARLOTTE I may have invented some of the details of her life , the convent , the son of the baker , his imprisoned father , the evil Sheriff , but Frances herself , is quite real . She still lives down in the village . p. 69 DELLAMAR ( not taking this seriously ) And is she dying soon ? CHARLOTTE Laugh if you want , Randall . But it is Frances I go to see twice a day , not this fisherman Cab is so jealous of . DELLAMAR And what is it you do there ? CHARLOTTE Nothing . I sit in a straight chair next to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When I arrive , her nurse takes a break and goes to a cafe and smokes cigarettes , but if I did n't come , the nurse would simply smoke the cigarettes leaning out the window , and the effect for Frances would be the same . DELLAMAR Do you mean , she does n't know you 're there ? CHARLOTTE ( after a moment ) The doctors say , well they 're French , so who knows what they say , really , but they say she is not technically in a coma . Still , she has n't said anything for over a year now . DELLAMAR But how awful for her . I ca n't imagine anything worse than dying in my bed , day after day , surrounded by all my family , and not being able to tell them to- ( loud ) GO AWAY ! CHARLOTTE You are hopeless . DELLAMAR And you are stuck . p. 70 CHARLOTTE No , I 'm not . I 'm saved ! Somehow , in simply sitting there , keeping an old aunt company while she dies , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ) You have n't found a thing except a new excuse for avoiding me . And everything else . You are using this old woman as an excuse to run away from your life ! CHARLOTTE ( furious ) That is not what I 'm doing ! DELLAMAR Well I wo n't let you . You have an obligation to remain in your life , with your friends , at your work- CHARLOTTE I have only those obligations I choose to accept , Randall . DELLAMAR Not so ! CHARLOTTE I will write no more finely wrought novels , no more essays , no more book reviews , or think pieces . I will scribble no more introductions , blurbs , lists of favorite little known novels . I will teach no more , raise no more money , play no part in public life . DELLAMAR I see . CHARLOTTE I will give no more parties , and I will attend no more parties , I 'm inviting no one to visit me , and entertaining no visitors . I will take care of my aunt until she dies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then I will live up here by myself til I die . DELLAMAR ( interrupting ) By yourself ? CHARLOTTE Yes . DELLAMAR Charlotte , you have never lived by yourself . You ca n't die by yourself . CHARLOTTE Yes I can . I want to . DELLAMAR You do n't . You 've always surrounded yourself with- CHARLOTTE Yes . I have given away everything I ever had , and gladly , , my hospitality , my money , my time , my quiet , to anyone who asked , all my life DELLAMAR People had to do more than ask , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE But I have finished being generous . Everything I have left , which is pretty much what you see in this house , is mine . I would like to live long enough to use it all up , and thenpoof . DELLAMAR ( after a moment ) And what about me ? CHARLOTTE I was counting on you to understand . DELLAMAR To understand that you do n't want me ? I would n't count on me for that . p. 72 CHARLOTTE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Randall you are my dearest friend , my truest personal- DELLAMAR What is it about me that you do n't want ? CHARLOTTE No , no . DELLAMAR My aging body , my addled brain ? CHARLOTTE Neither of which you have . DELLAMAR My shallow soul . My pretentious babble . CHARLOTTE Stop this . DELLAMAR I love you , Charlotte . I have always loved you . CHARLOTTE Do n't do this , Randall . Please do n't . DELLAMAR And I have always assumed that one day you would tire of lovers and literature , and you would pause , a cup of punch in your hand , and glance down at your dance card . And there on the bottom line , you would read my name . And you would look up to find me , and there I would be . And we would take one final spin around the floor , and then we would go home . Together . CHARLOTTE Randall , please . DELLAMAR And you thought so too . ( a moment ) Did n't you . ( more angry ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DELLAMAR You were saving me for last . And you wanted more than companionship . You wanted what I feel for you . You wanted this absolute blind love I have felt my whole life . And of all the people you know , only I have a lifetime of love for you . CHARLOTTE Yes . DELLAMAR Then take it , Charlotte . Take it now , right now . And we 'll have years of tenderness and good times , sweet Jesus , we will be happy . We will talk and talk . I 'll read you whatever poet you fancy now , Rilke , Jane Austen , Auden . I 'll read you Auden you never heard of . CHARLOTTE Oh , Randall . He takes her in his arms and kisses her passionately . She strokes his hair . It is a meltingly powerful kiss . Finally , she pulls away from him . DELLAMAR How I have longed for this moment . CHARLOTTE ( a beat , she turns away ) I ca n't , Randall . DELLAMAR Yes , you can . I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proud . You do n't need to be proud . CHARLOTTE Do n't tell me what I need . DELLAMAR You 're not scared , are you ? p. 74 CHARLOTTE I 'm not scared . I do n't want you here talking to me all the time . I do n't want to take care of you . I want to be by myself . DELLAMAR Oh , my God . You 're afraid of getting old . CHARLOTTE No . DELLAMAR You are ! You ca n't bear the thought of the losses that lie ahead , your beauty , your energy , your interest in your work , your command of the language , your memory , your eyesight , your hearing , but worst of all , your passion , your desire . CHARLOTTE No . DELLAMAR But you can feel it coming . Well , hell , we all can , but you , my vain darling , you ca n't stand for anyone to watch this happening to you . So you have decided to simply disappear at the height of your glory and leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am hardly at the height of my glory , Randall . DELLAMAR ( calmly ) But Charlotte , you know that you are . You have finally become the one person you can spend all your time with . CHARLOTTE You are cruel . You make it sound selfish . DELLAMAR It is . CHARLOTTE Fine . Think of it however you like . You will not change my mind . p. 75 DELLAMAR Well I pray to God something will . Give this boy away , turn me down , and you are dead like your Aunt in her bed . CHARLOTTE ( furious ) You are wrong . You do n't know what I 'm going to do . DELLAMAR ( a moment ) Are you going to write ? CHARLOTTE ( a moment ) Maybe . DELLAMAR But writing has never made you choose before . You can write with Cab here or me , either one . CHARLOTTE No , Randall , I ca n't . I wish I did n't have to choose , but I do . And I have . I mean to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whatever that means , but I do n't think it 's card games and deck chairs . I think it 's years and years I know nothing about yet . All those days I wished I had an extra hour ? Well , here they come , all those hours , all lined up , ready to be lived . And if all I have to do to get that time is let go of my youth , I say fine . Whatever comes next , I say Let 's have it . I 'm not hanging onto my precious youth one more day . ( a moment ) You are the scared one , Randall , so scared of being alone you do n't even want to hear me talk about it . So why do n't you get married if you 're so scared . I believe Georgeanne 's mother is available . And I 'm sure she 'd be only too happy to fill up all your free time . p. 76 DELLAMAR Well , maybe I will . I 'm sure you 're being very brave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners to say that you are . But I do n't want to be by myself . I play no value on it and consequently have never learned how . Isolation is for those who deserve it . CHARLOTTE Indeed it is . After a moment , satisfied that she has explained herself , Charlotte returns to her old flirtatious ways . CHARLOTTE Oh now Randall , I wo n't be by myself . I will see my Aunt 's nurse . I will see people at the market . I will see the men at the dock . Randall understands she is trying to help him over this rejection . He begins to come around . DELLAMAR The men at the dock . That 's it , is n't it . The fisherman rejected you . It never occurred to me , but of course that 's it . CHARLOTTE Of course . And now the conversation resumes its convivial tone . DELLAMAR Is he truly the first man who was able to walk away from you ? But that must have been unbearable . But look now , Charlotte @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this . Perhaps he 's only aroused by very large , oily women with slick skin who slap him and bark like seals . Or maybe the man loves mermaids ! p. 77 CHARLOTTE I 'm sorry I invited you here . Please leave as soon as you are able . DELLAMAR I could never leave you at a time like this . You poor thing . You finally found the man of your dreams , a kind of self-educated , salty Tarzan type and then he did n't like you . Now she is playing with him , in their old way. @x Cab chases Georgeanne down the beach . There is shrieking and fun . Finally , he catches her and they sit on a rock . She is in a state of mind he does n't quite understand . CAB What ? She begins to move but he stops her with a gentle touch . GEORGEANNE I am so ashamed I can hardly speak . The things we did to each other in my bed . The things you said . CAB George , George , thosethings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were ? CAB It is you , sweet girl , who are not . GEORGEANNE But I want so desperately to be normal . What else must I do ? CAB Please stop playing with me . GEORGEANNE I 'm not playing with you . I swear . But if you want me to stop CAB No . Do n't stop . Whatever you are doing , it makes me feel like such a ( he stops , shakes his head ) GEORGEANNE ( she goes on ) It 's nothin ' I 'm doin ' . This is what you are ! You are ! A change in Cab . p. 79 CAB What am I Georgeanne ? What is it I feel like when I 'm with you ? GEORGEANNE Why I ca n't tell you that . I 'm embarrassed . CAB What I was going to say then ? It makes me feel like such a what , Georgeanne . GEORGEANNE Cab , please . Do n't make me say those words . I do n't like those words . And instantly something has changed for Cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to say Like a fucking man . Now what is wrong with that ? Nothing . GEORGEANNE Oh please do n't be mad . But what have I done ? A minute ago you were begging me not to leave and now you hate me . CAB I do n't hate you . I hate myself for how I have behaved , making you tell me how wonderful I am . Making you beg me not to be mad . This is not some stupid game men and women can play . Either I care for you , in which case I owe you the courtesy of treating you like an intelligent being , or I do n't care for you , in which case I still owe you the courtesy of treating you like an intelligent being . GEORGEANNE You 're not making me play these games , Cab . I enjoy these harmless fictions , the simple one overcome by joy . And I am so terribly glad the South still exists so I can continue to practice them . But if it really bothers you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ p. 80 CAB It 's all right . GEORGEANNE - and I never loved a man in real love before , so I do n't know how to say it to him . CAB I love you too . GEORGEANNE You do ? CAB I do n't know how this happened . GEORGEANNE Neither do I. CAB Will you marry me , Georgeanne ? GEORGEANNE I will . CAB When ? GEORGEANNE Whenever you like . Tomorrow . Two years from now . Up to you . CAB Where ? GEORGEANNE I do n't care . CAB Katmandu ? GEORGEANNE Fine . CAB Really ? GEORGEANNE Yes . CAB Why is this all so easy ? GEORGEANNE Because all I want is you . CAB But what about your work ? Your family ? Your friends and your , I do n't know , your interests , whatever they are . p. 81 GEORGEANNE But I already have those things . Do you like this plain way of speaking ? CAB I do . GEORGEANNE All right then . We will talk this way when we need to . When we want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel outside the South and do n't want to be thought indolent or ignorant or both . They kiss . CAB I 'd better go have a conversation with Charlotte . GEORGEANNE ( reverting back to her dialect ) @x Cab comes into the house where Charlotte is preparing a tray of hors d'oeuvres for supper . She has changed clothes and is looking relaxed and happy . CHARLOTTE There you are . He comes up behind her , holds her tenderly and kisses her on the back of the neck . CAB Hello , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE I feel like I have n't seen you all day . He walks away . CAB I thought that was what you wanted . Charlotte watches him a moment , then . CHARLOTTE Randall said you went to town with Georgeanne . CAB We said we were going to town , but we did n't make it . Charlotte knows that more is coming , but is content to wait for it . CHARLOTTE Did you go out in the boat ? CAB Why could n't you love me the way Georgeanne loves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she has taken me deep into her real heart , something you have never done , Charlotte . p. 84 CHARLOTTE No . CAB But why ? What did I do wrong ? CHARLOTTE You did nothing wrong . CAB All I ever wanted , Charlotte , was to love you for the rest of time . To sleep with you , and wake up with you , and take care of you if you needed it , and travel with you and read to you , and comb your hair , and comfort you when you felt sad and cheer you up if I could , and go off and do whatever dumb thing you said , just for the privilege of looking at you when I got back . A moment CAB You did n't have to feel the same way about me . You just had tolet me love you . I would never have interfered with anything you wanted to do , ever . All you had to do was tell me how to stay out of the way . A moment . CAB You could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with anyone you wanted , and I would still have been here when you got back . You could 've asked me to leave you alone for a couple of years and I 'd have been right here as soon as the time was up . A moment CAB I would 've promised you anything , and I would 've kept my promise . CHARLOTTE I know . p. 85 CAB ( a moment ) Then will you tell me why you have thrown me over for this fisherman ? And do n't tell me it 's because of Aunt Frances because I do n't believe it is . CHARLOTTE No . It 's not . Perhaps I should have introduced you to Frances . I do n't know why I did n't . Perhaps because I because I do n't know . She 's the only one who 's really mine , I guess . CAB But this fisherman is yours , Charlotte . I 've seen the way he looks at you . Only Georgeanne tells me he 's married . Now you ca n't go breaking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , that is true . He is married to Frances . CAB The man you 're always talking to at the dock is not old enough to be your Aunt 's husband . CHARLOTTE He may not be old enough , but he is her husband , Cab . They married when he was about your age , I think . CAB So it was n't him . CHARLOTTE No . But you may say it was , if you like . CAB I need something to tell myself . CHARLOTTE Then you may say that I left my true love at the dance so I could see what there was to think about on the way home . p. 86 CAB Randall showed me the poem you wrote . Is that what you 're going to do ? CHARLOTTE I want to have time for poetry to come into my life , if it will . I did n't know this would happen , but as I sat there with my aunt , day after day , all the noise and clatter of my life fell away , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could , and proclaim my freedom . And yours , though you may not want yours just yet . CAB I do n't like quiet . CHARLOTTE I know . CAB I have asked Georgeanne to marry me . CHARLOTTE And she has said yes ? CAB She did . As easy as that . Just yes . Wherever I want , whenever I want . Charlotte is overcome with emotion . She may cry . CHARLOTTE And when will the wedding be ? CAB Whenever she wants . CHARLOTTE What wonderful news . CAB It 's what you wanted , I think . CHARLOTTE It is . CAB I thought it would make you happy . Then something escapes from her unbidden. p. 87 CHARLOTTE Oh how I love you . Georgeanne and Randall appear at the door . CAB Look at those two . So eager to know what 's going on in here . DELLAMAR I have come to defend your honor , Charlotte . Just tell me which of these wretched ingrates you would have me slay first . CHARLOTTE Georgeanne , Cab has told me your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell you how happy this makes me . DELLAMAR I 've been trying to talk some sense into Georgeanne , but to no avail . She is just determined to rush headlong into this disastrous coupling . Charlotte embraces Georgeanne . CHARLOTTE Why I think it 's inspired , Randall . Even if it was my idea . GEORGEANNE I do n't see any reason for us to wait . I plan to discuss it with Cab as soon as we are alone . CAB And I plan to agree with her on all counts . CHARLOTTE I believe this occasion calls for champagne . DELLAMAR As do I. Then Charlotte , I 'd say all that remains for us is to go out on the verandah and watch the moon rise over the ocean and discuss what we will wear to the upcoming nuptials . I want all present on that occasion to enjoy the spectacle of two old friends who , though they have practiced a lifelong disregard for the rules of polite society , nevertheless find themselves the absolute embodiment of Southern gentry . We have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we bear no malice , and have no regrets , and as such , we are finally pronounced free to go and do as we please . I myself intend at last to give in and marry that divine little flirt that is Georgeanne 's mother . Georgeanne gasps . p. 88 CAB Oh my God . He 's going to be my father-in-law ? DELLAMAR Come with me to the veranda , Charlotte . CHARLOTTE Well , just for a moment and then we 'll have our supper . I do love the light at the end of the day . Randall offers his arm to Charlotte and she takes it and they walk off . Cab and Georgeanne kiss . Then he walks offstage and Georgeanne addresses the audience . GEORGEANNE Cab and I were married the next month in a seaside hotel in Savannah , Georgia where my mother lives , and shortly thereafter , she married Randall in an even more lavish affair . Charlotte came back here and sat with Aunt Frances until she died . We never saw Charlotte again but according to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading , making tea and growing flowers . Randall believes she did none of those things , but who can say . What we know for certain is that she wrote several volumes of very direct , very sensual poetry , which are now widely read . The poems clearly describe vivid personal experience , so whatever Charlotte really did for the rest of her life , we can draw no other conclusion than that she was very happy . CAB ( appears at the door wearing a sportcoat ) It 's time to go , George . p. 89 GEORGEANNE Cab has become an architect with a very prestigious Atlanta firm , and I am now teaching French literature at Agnes Scott . Our two handsome boys both want to be writers , though we hope they will find something that is more dependable before they marry the darling twins they are currently seeing . CAB George . GEORGEANNE We are back here today to bury Charlotte , one of the last generation of Southerners who lived as she did , and spoke in the old way . She will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descendant of Louis XVI in exchange for a sexual favor involvingno . That 's made up . ( now without her accent ) We will bury Charlotte in the small village cemetery behind the church . In the plot with Frances , where Jean-Luc would have been had he not disappeared shortly after Frances died . ( picking up a small volume ) We will also be reading this poem from Charlotte 's final work . Charlotte appears , perhaps with her hair up , and wearing glasses . As if working .                                                                                                   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
