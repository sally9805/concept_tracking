<p> A couple of months ago , Deer Park head football coach John Patterson had tears in his eyes as he sat in a car and talked with good friend and booster club vice president Kim Walt . <p> Walt had just finished spearheading a benefit for the 50-year-old coach . She collected $ 33,516 . <p> " We were sitting there and I asked him if he wanted to hear the final totals , " an emotional Walt said as she recalled one of her most touching moments with Patterson . " I told him how much and he sat there totally dumbfounded . You could see the tears welling up in his eyes . He finally looked over at me and said ' I ca n't believe people like me that much . I ca n't thank you enough for what you did . " <p> The benefit happened in March . John Patterson died of complications due to pancreatic cancer at 11 a.m . June 3 . <p> Patterson left behind his wife , Geri , four sons - Nolan , Jeff , Scott and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-workers . <p> " John was a wonderful human being , " Kim Walt said . " He was very generous . He also had a wonderful sense of humor . Most folks did n't know that about John . But he messed with me every opportunity he had . <p> " We would be on the sidelines in the middle of an important game and he would walk by and step on my toes , stick his behind in my camera , whatever . Nobody really knew that side of John . He was very much a dying breed . " <p> Patterson spent 29 years in coaching - seven in Kansas and 22 in Texas . He spent four years as Deer Park 's defensive coordinator before taking over as the Deer 's head coach in 2002 . In his only year as head coach , Patterson guided Deer Park to an 8-4 record and a berth in the area round of the Region III-5A state playoffs . <p> " John was a very cool-headed person , " said Deer Park Director of Athletics Art Pettit . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great motivater of young kids . He had all the respect of his coaches and his peers . " <p> Deer Park defensive end J.D. Walt , who will attend Baylor University in the fall , agreed with Pettit . <p> " He had the total support of the kids , parents and the community , " J.D. Walt said . <p> Patterson had a kidney removed and was taking chemotherapy treatments in hopes of fighting off the deadly disease . <p> " I talked to John on Friday ( May 30 ) and told me he felt better that day than he had in several months , " Pettit said . " He was energetic and had bounce in his voice . " <p> But a couple days later , Patterson was back in the hospital . <p> " John was a fighter , " Pettit said . " He kept bouncing back and bouncing back . But this time , he just could n't bounce back . I am going to miss John Patterson a great deal . He did what he loved doing until the day he died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had a very keen mind . He was a dream coach for us . " <p> Deer Park offensive coordinator Tim Smith and defensive coordinator Marc Milliorn also said he was a dream coach to work for . <p> " He came in the same year I did , 1998 , " Smith said of Patterson . " When I became the offensive coordinator , and he became the head coach , I would n't say I worked for him , but I worked with him . We had a great rapport . He was very easy going . I would go in with an idea and he would say run with it , go with it . <p> " What a lot of people do n't realize is that John also did a lot of things for kids who were n't well off . He took kids home . He made phone calls constantly to check on kids , check on kids ' grades . I would bet there are 10 kids at Deer Park who do n't graduate without John Patterson . " <p> " I sat next to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Milliorn said . " I learned a tremendous amount about dealing with people and treating athletes the same way from John . From the third-string guy to the stud athlete , he treated them all the same . John Patterson treated every person equal . He earned his respect by doing this . " <p> He respected the coaches on his staff in the same way . <p> " When John wanted you to do something or come up with something , he gave it to you , then left you alone , " Milliorn added . " He knew you would get it taken care of . He never said a word about it . He gave you respect as a professional . He was my boss the last five years , but I never looked at him as being any different . He was my friend . " <p> Pettit said Patterson 's on-field demeanor was something most coaches could learn from . <p> " My favorite memory of John is him on the field with the headset on being calm and under control , " Pettit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance or the score . He always had the demeanor of being under control . <p> " I was a shouter and a yeller when I coached . John did n't get excited . But when we made the playoffs last year , that glow and calmness left him . He became very excited . He did have emotions , but he was able to keep everything under control inside . " <p> " He was very mild-mannered , " said Kim Walt , who takes pictures for various publications during the football games . " Very little riled him . Even bad calls , he would just walk away and let it go . He would n't let it drive him nuts . He never placed blame that way . He would never say we won or lost because of a bad call . <p> " He was a very fair man . He wanted to see every kid play as much as possible . At the same time , he was the coach and he knew the bottom line was getting us there ( to the playoffs ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the boys . Given another year , I think he would have really taken us a long way . " <p> Pettit said the search for a new head football coach will start in the next few days . Deer Park has a long history of promoting assistant coaches up through the ranks . <p> " Right now , I am not even thinking about that , " said Milliorn , who could be elevated to head coach . " My friend just passed away . I am just trying to get through this week . " <p> Smith echoed those sentiments . <p> " John was my friend first , then my friend became the head coach , " Smith said . " I have my own goals . I want to be a head coach some day myself . But I am not thinking about that right now . <p> I still keep expecting John to walk around the corner in his flip flops and start talking about the Astros . He was a tremendous sports fan . " <p> And a tremendous role model , Milliorn said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man as he was and be as good a coach as he was , " Milliorn said . " I like to emulate the people I respect . I respected John Patterson a tremendous amount . If I could be as good a person dealing with kids , the parents and the staff as he did , I would be happy with that . " <p> " We had several seniors who left project graduation to help move him , " Kim Walt said . " If that does n't tell you about his character , I do n't know what does . <p> " He came across as a typical head coach , but he was so far from that . Words ca n't describe how different he was . That is why so many people liked him so much . " <p> TYPE : Obituary
