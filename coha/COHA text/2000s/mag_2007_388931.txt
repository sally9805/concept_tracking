Headnote Intuition really does come from the gut . It 's also a kind of matching game based on experience . There are times when trusting your gut is the smartest move-and times you 'd better think twice . YOU " KNOW " THINGS . YOU DO N'T EVEN KNOW how you know them . Yet you have a sense of certainty when driving down a strange street that you really must make a left turn . Or comfort a co-worker who insists she 's fine . Or quit your job and move to Paris . Intuitions , or gut feelings , are sudden , strong judgments whose origin we ca n't immediately explain . Although they seem to emerge from an obscure inner force , they actually begin with a perception of something outside-a facial expression , a tone of voice , a visual inconsistency so fleetingyou 're not even aware you noticed . Think of them as rapid cognition or condensed reasoning that takes advantage of the brain 's built-in shortcuts . Or think of intuition as an unconscious associative process . Long dismissed as magical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to muster some fancy and fast mental operations . The best explanation psychologists now offer is that intuition is a mental matching game . The brain takes in a situation , does a very quick search of its files , and then finds its best analogue among the stored sprawl of memories and knowledge . Based on that analogy , you ascribe meaning to the situation in front of you . A doctor might simply glance at a pallid young woman complaining of fatigue and shortness of breath and immediately intuit she suffers from anemia . The gut itself literally feeds gut feelings ; think ofbutterflies in the stomach when a decision is pending . The gut has millions of nerve cells and , through them , a " mind of its own , " says Michael Gershon , author of The Second Brain and a professor at Columbia University . Still , gut feelings do not originate there , but in signals from the brain . That visceral punch in the paunch is testament that emotions are an intrinsic part of all gut feelings . " I do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cognitive scientist Alexandre Linhares at the Brazilian School of Business and Public Administration . Emotion guides how we learn from experience ; if you witness something while your adrenaline is pumping , for instance , it will be remembered very vividly . Experience is encoded in our brains as a web of fact and feeling . When a new experience calls up a similar pattern , it does n't unleash just stored knowledge but also an emotional state of mind and a predisposition to respond in a certain way . Imagine meeting a date who reminds you of loved ones and also of the emotions you 've felt toward those people . Suddenly you begin to fall for him or her . " Intuition , " says Linhares , " can be described as " almost immediate situation understanding ' as opposed to " immediate knowledge . " Understanding is filled with emotion . We do n't obtain knowledge of love , danger , or joy ; we feel them in a meaningful way . " Encased in certainty , intuitions compel us to act in specific ways , and those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bechara at the University of Southern California studied brain-damaged patients who could not form emotional intuitions when making a decision . They were left to decide purely via deliberate reasoning . " They ended up doing such a complicated analysis , factoring everything in , that it could take them hours to decide between two kinds of cereal , " he says . While endless reasoning in the absence of guiding intuitions is unproductive , some people , including President Bush , champion the other extreme- " going with the gut " at all times . Intuition , however , is best used as the first step in solving a problem or deciding what to do . The more experience you have in a particular domain , the more reliable your intuitions , because they arise out of the richest array of collected patterns of experience . But even in your area of expertise , it 's wisest to test out your hunches-you could easily have latched on to the wrong detail and pulled up the wrong web of associations in your brain . When researcher Douglas Hofstadter is starting a knotty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunch . Then he hunkers down and calculates . After two weeks , perhaps he 'll see a roadblock and give up . Another hunch pushes him to a new tack , and perhaps it is the right one . It 's time to declare an end to the battle between gut and mind-and to the belief that intuitions are parapsychological fluff . Better to explore how the internalized experiences from which gut feelings arise best interact with the deliberate calculations of the conscious mind . + GOING WITH YOUR GUT CAN BE A WINNING STRATEGY FOR TRIVIA GAMES AND TESTS YOU 'VE MEMORIZED THE ALMANAC AND YOU 'RE READY TO TAKE DOWN YOUR Trivial Pursuit opponents . Well , do n't get too cocky-sometimes knowing less about a question helps you pick the correct answer . Intuition does the guesswork . Case in point : A kid is asked whether Spain or Portugal has a bigger population . He guesses Spain , simply because he 's never even heard of Portugal . And he is right ; there is a reason he is n't yet aware of Spain 's less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lack of knowledge , says Gerd Gigerenzer of the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin and author of Gut Feelings , to be published next month . A UNIVERSITY OF LONDON TEAM FOUND THAT PEOPLE WHO WENT WITH their initial response on a test of visual perception ( questions included picking out an anomaly in a pattern of symbols ) did better than those who were given more time to ponder . Whereas the subconscious brain recognized a rotated version of the same symbol as different , the conscious brain reasoned that " an apple is still an apple whether rotated or not , " the researchers concluded . When the subjects had time to engage their higher-level functions instead of relying on their intuitive responses , they were more likely to be wrong . Jody Steinglass , founder of Empire Education , a private New York City-based tutoring company , says that the trick to preparing for standardized tests such as the SAT is to hone intuition by identifying cues-say , certain words-that let you know which category a question belongs to ( quadratic equation ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Right before test time , we go through drills where I will give students a list of questions . I do n't have them actually solve them but just quickly tell me how they would solve each one . This way they are trained to make good snap judgments and then to confidently trust those judgments . " + YOUR GUT KNOWS MORE ABOUT YOU THAN YOUR DOCTOR DOES A SENSE THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS in your body , even in the absence of an obvious physical symptom , could be an important intuition worth sharing with your doctor . After all , only you know how tired you are , how much your appetite has fluctuated , and whether you simply feel different from usual-it 's all exclusive information . For their part , doctors ' clinical intuitions are biased-by a desire to protect themselves , by their specialty , by the kinds of cases they 've recently treated , and even by geography ( one state may be Cesarean-crazy ) . A great method for improving treatment decisions , says Gigerenzer , stands midway between pure intuition and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that distill clinical expertise , focus on the most telling symptoms , and ask a few yes-or-no questions-ultimately leading to clear instructions on what to do with the patient ( send her to a regular nursing bed or to a coronary care unit ? ) . Such trees help focus attention on the most important symptoms without letting the conscious brain run wild with all the diagnostic variables . + GREAT LIAR-DETECTORS BUILD ON A BIG ROLODEX MANY OF US ARE SURE WE COULD NEVER BE DECEIVED , AND YET OUR GUT INSTINCTS ABOUT people 's veracity are usually off . " We do n't pay enough attention to all the channels of communication , and we believe what we want to believe , " says Maureen O'Sullivan , professor of psychology at the University of San Francisco . There are no set rules to follow in order to improve your fib-spotting-liars do not necessarily avoid eye contact , for example . But you can ask yourself questions , such as whether the person you are sizing up is deviating from his or her typical repertoire of behaviors . If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice , she may indeed be hiding something . There is , however , a tiny elite whose deception detection could be considered intuitive . O'Sullivan has spent years identifying and studying " truth wizards , " people with a way-above-average ability to detect lies . Interestingly , they have various modes of arriving at their spot-on intuitions . Some are very empathetic and sort of morph into the person they are judging . " As they assume the subtle postures and expressions of the other person , they seem to be putting themselves into their skin , or into their emotional reality , " she says . Others coolly notice subtle nonverbal cues and voice tones and put all of those together in a meaningful way . And until directly questioned , most are unaware of what they are doing . O'Sullivan compares the truth wizards to Agatha Christie 's fictional Miss Marple , who accurately judges people by matching them against a Rolodex of personality types in her head . Unsurprisingly , astute judges of character are people who have an intense interest in people and a broad range @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corporate lawyer who also worked in a coal mine at one point , " she says . Though you may not reach wizard status , anyone can improve general interpersonal intuition . Simply put , if you are highly motivated to understand people , your intuitions about them will be better . Take Douglas Hofstadter , professor of cognitive science and computer science at Indiana University , who has spent his life trying , he says . After all , he creates models of the human mind . " I 'm deeply curious about what makes people do certain things . I am somebody who spends a great deal of time trying to understand what the real reasons for their behavior are . " Even so , Hofstadter emphasizes the importance of not prematurely closing your mind when it comes to intuitions about people and their motivations . " You have to test these cautiously . When you have confirmation-then you can make the daring leap , " he says , whether it 's telling your friend that you suspect she 's getting divorced for the wrong reason or confronting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LOVE TURNS INTUITION UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE YOU KNOW HIM SO WELL , YOUR INTUITIONS about what your spouse is thinking and feeling are fairly correct . But that does n't mean you should always act on them . Let 's say your husband is flipping through a catalog and you can sense that he 's thinking about how much he 'd like to be with one of the lingerie models . Research on " mind reading " tells us that in such situations , where " relationship-threatening " thoughts are intuited , happier couples keep their hunches to themselves . They do n't bother to test them out ; they understand that such thoughts are temporary and not serious . Anxious people need to apply the most caution . They are particularly accurate at divining any negative feelings and thoughts their spouse might be having . But the catch is , they are probably missing the positive things their partner is also thinking about them . Singling out critical feelings only winds up sabotaging the relationship . Jeff Simpson , professor of psychology at the University of Minnesota , who has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Anxious women are accurate at the wrong times . " Alas , your intuition may have led you down the aisle in the first place , but that does n't mean it wo n't turn around and trip you up . + IMPROVISATION TAKES INSTANT FEEDBACKAND YEARS OF PRACTICE THE SPONTANEOUS VOYAGE THAT creative improvisers take their audiences on exemplifies a paradox of intuition : The more a jazz musician has deliberately prepared throughout his musical career , the better he is at instantly responding to the cues around him when deciding what to invent in the moment onstage . " Virtually all serious students of jazz copy solos from their favorite musicians ' records , " says guitarist Randy Napoleon . " All our preparation in music is designed to make our instincts more reliable , our execution more free . Gut-level playing is mastery born from a lifetime of discipline and thought . The more you think , analyze , study , practice , the stronger you internalize the natural flow of music . You are free to think less when on the bandstand and trust your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marketing at London Business School , is a decision researcher who moonlights as a comic . " It 's not that improvisers are intuitively funny-no matter who they are , " he says . " It 's this thing of doing drill after drill , and after you 've mastered those drills , you 've internalized them . You can apply them quickly , and with a cool head . " + MORALITYCOMES FROM THE GUT ; EX(PLANATIONS) POST FACTO WE THINK OF MORAL DECISIONS AS THE RAW MATERIAL of great drama-as warring internal desires or puzzles to solve via logical arguments . But most people actually determine whether an action is right or wrong automatically , finds Jonathan Haidt , associate professor of psychology at the University of Virginia and author of The Happiness Hypothesis . Haidt likens moral intuitions to aesthetic judgments : We instantly know whether we think something is beautiful , but we do n't necessarily know why . " The rational mind is like a press secretary that spins reasons for our intuitive moral decisions , " he says . The " press secretary " is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like and defending ourselves . Haidt theorizes that we have evolved this way because of the competitive advantage attached to being able to navigate society 's dense web of gossip . Because what people think you do is just as important as what you do , it pays to be able to explain your behaviors in a rosy light . That makes the internal machinery inherently self-deceiving . You may have no qualms about cheating on your taxes , but you 'll probably think twice after speaking with friends about it ( if you dare even bring it up ) . That 's why Haidt does not advocate going with your gut when contemplating a moral decision . " The general advice I would give is to check with others to see what they think . " We can see the splinter in our neighbor 's eye , after all , but not the plank in our own . +A STRONG HUNCH CAN BE THE BEGINNING OF A BEAUTIFUL RELATIONSHIP WE 'VE ALL HEARD STORIES OF COUPLES who " just knew " the moment they met that something serious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , professor of psychology at Hope College and the author of Intuition , had that feeling about a young woman as a teenager ; they 've been married for more than 40 years now . ) The heart has reasons which reason does not know , said the philosopher Biaise Pascal . But maybe the " heart " is governed by the unconscious emotional pattern matching that produces intuitions . Bechara describes the phenomenon as an overall feeling that someone would be " good for you , " perhaps even irrespective of passion . " It 's tapping into your unconscious and triggering prior emotional experiences . We need to trust that this is a survival system that has evolved to our benefit , " he says . As choosing a mate is rife with unknowns , it 's not best arrived at by number crunching . Gigerenzer tells the story of how Ben Franklin advised his nephew , torn between two sweethearts , to list each woman 's qualities , place a numeric value on the importance of those qualities , and total each column . But when a friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his heart sank . That 's how the friend knew he really wanted the other woman . + BIG PURCHASES BENEFIT FROM INTUITION , BUT NOT STOCK PICKS OUR BRAINS HAVE A NUMBER OF INNATE CAPACITIES , BUT they grow out of ancestral , not modern , problems , says Terry Burnham , author of Mean Markets and Lizard Brains . The types of dilemmas we are good at solving intuitively are ones in which the old machinery lines up well to produce positive contemporary outcomes . Investing is not among these . Any gut feeling you may have about where to put your money is probably very similar to many others ' gut feelings ( say , going with a stock that has been on the upswing for a while ) . It 's simply not investment-savvy to pick the same stocks as everyone else-you will not stand to gain . Burnham advises that you set up a system to ensure that your prefrontal cortex , and not your gut , is firmly in charge of financial decisions . You need to analyze investment strategies and information about different companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mini bar in hotel rooms lest he give in to a late-night junk-food craving , he " locks in " his money by making sure he ca n't change his allocations without an adviser 's authorization . That way , he wo n't move his money around on a whim . Intuition , however , is a reliable source of purchasing decisions , at least for big-ticket items . The only goal of investing money is to make a profit ; cold calculations count . Material possessions , on the other hand , have a subjective value-you want products to bring some ease , comfort , or happiness . When it comes to complex acquisitions such as homes and cars , consumer satisfaction is greater among buyers who decide with their gut . The experience of living in a house is ultimately an emotional and unpredictable one ; so throw away your spreadsheet and rely on your " old brain " to assess whether or not you 'll get more pleasure than pain out of the purchase . Resume rational deliberation for the little stuff ; research shows it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shampoo . IT 'S COMFORTING TO know you can lean on your unconscious when facingbig life questions . And , even better , you 've got a mind that can both listen to the gut and keep it in line .
