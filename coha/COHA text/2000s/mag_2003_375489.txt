Howard Dean is hardly what you would call a high-tech guru . The former Vermont Governor , whose trademark look is a blue shirt with rolled-up sleeves , is a mostly gadget-free zone . He does not carry a BlackBerry email pager or tablet PC ( he leaves those to his aides ) . And do n't expect to find Dean , 54 , surfing the Web for hours at home . " I kind of missed the Internet boom , " concedes the physician . <P> Yet the Internet boom has not missed Dean . Rather , it has handed him a bonanza of cash and buzz that would make most 1990s dotcom veterans  --  and politicians  --  weep . In the past three months , it was revealed last week , Dean has raised $7.5 million , $1.5 million more than his nearest Democratic rival , Massachusetts Senator John Kerry , nudging Dean into the top tier of Democratic candidates . Two-thirds of all Dean contributions were made online . And as often happens in politics , bucks begat the Big Mo . A poll in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Dean in second place , a mere percentage point behind Dick Gephardt . Once viewed as a no-hoper for the nomination , notable only for his vehement opposition to the war in Iraq , Dean is increasingly forcing his party 's other candidates to adjust their strategies as they figure out how to slow his momentum . <P> Rival campaigns immediately scrambled to prove that Dean 's breakthrough meant little . " Nobody has ever doubted the intensity of Dean 's support , " says Jim Jordan , campaign manager for Kerry . " The question is , Can he broaden it ? " Dean , meanwhile , is quick to downplay the notion that his rise is only a cybersurge : " The Internet is a tool , not a campaign platform . " <P> Dean 's campaign stands out because the Internet provides its fuel as well as its funding . His early success suggests that the Internet may prove to be the great modern means of creating grassroots momentum . His Internet supporters  --  an army 55,000 strong and growing  --  find one another on the Web @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the most interactive effort in electoral history . " They were n't just sending email solicitations , " a Democratic official says of the Dean campaign . " They developed an online community , nurtured it and , once it was firmly established , mined it . " <P> Dean 's chain of websites , run mainly by tech-savvy campaign manager Joe Trippi and the campaign 's four Internet-dedicated staff members , has a sense of fun that rivals old-time political carnivals .
