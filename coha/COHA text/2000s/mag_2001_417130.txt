The streets of El Bawiti , the largest town in Bahariya Oasis , are busier now . Hotels have been built since more than 200 Greco-Roman mummies were discovered nearby. * Yet El Bawiti hid an older secret . We have found the tombs of Bahariya 's legendary governor , Zed-Khons-uef-ankh ( left ) , his father , and his wife in a maze of chambers beneath local homes ( right ) . Archaeologists had been look ing for Zed-Khons-uef-ankh ever since my coun tryman Ahmed Fakhry found tombs of three of the governor 's relatives in 1938 . Zed-Khons-uef-ankh ruled Bahariya during Egypt 's 26th dynasty ( 664-525 B.c. ) , a time when the isolated oases of the Western Desert were strategi cally important buffers against Libyan invaders . Source of fine wines , Bahariya thrived at the crossroads of caravan routes . Its governors were wealthy men with connections to the throne . Zed  --  Khons-uef-ankh built a chapel in a temple nearby with a relief depicting him as large as the pharaoh , a bold assertion from a powerful man we now know better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ below the Sheikh Sobi neighborhood . Who was buried there ? A sealed doorway inscribed with Zed-Khons  --  uef-ankh 's name tantalized us , but we had to wait until the next field season to enter the chamber , remove , rubble , and then haul out bag after bag of yellow hematite powder of unknow origin . It was backbreaking work , but our reward was great : a massive limestone sarcophagus ( top left ) with a splendid face , probably the work of master sculptors in distant Memphis , and an inscription identifying its occupant  --  Zed-Khons  --  uef-ankh , governor of Waht  --  Smenkht , a previously unknown epithet meaning " deep-rooted oasis , " which suggests a long , peaceful rule . Days later the chamber echoed with the chants of workers as the lid was pushed aside , exposing a second sarcophagus , made of alabaster , I noticed a hole in its side , cut by looters during the Roman period . I waited with my notebook as its lid was removed ( bottom left ) . Inside , the wooden coffin and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As we combed the chamber and sifted the powder , we discovered remnants of the governor 's beaded shroud left by the robbers ( below ) : a gold ba-winged symbol of the soul-and protective cobras . In between the sarcophagi we found a gold amulet of Qebeh-sennuef ( above ) , guardian of the intestines , removed during mummification . A team of servants for the afterlife The sarcophagus of Zed  --  Khons-uef-ankh 's father ( facing page ) , former governor Padi-Iset , lay amid glazed ushabti ( right ) , stand-ins for the deceased should the gods demand labor in the afterlife . Carved to look like mummies and inscribed with his name , Padi-Iset 's ushabti were even finer than his son 's . Splendid adornments for the wife of a man A surprise waited for us north of Zed-Khons  --  uef-ankh 's burial chamber . Beneath a pile of caved-in sandstone we uncovered the sarcophagus of a woman called Naes ( above , being examined by my assistant Mansour Boriak ) . Inscriptions on 224 ushabti found beside her sarcophagus suggest that she was the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apart from a missing ornamental collar-her spine was broken at the neck by its hasty removal-most of her adornments remain where we would expect to find them in an undisturbed tomb . Her burial shroud was decorated with amulets of precious stone ( top right ) , as well as at least 84 gold beads . Embalmers replaced her tongue with a shield-shaped pieace of gold ( right , at center ) . She wore a gold ring on her left hand , gold fingertips , and gold toe covers . A gold amulet with a heart ( ib ) below a sun disk ( re ) - seen at right under her right fingertip covers-is a symbolic representation of Pharaoh Apries 's birth name , Wah-Ib-Re . We think it was a gift to the governor from a satisfied king . The splendor of their mortuary complex reflects the family 's status . The gold objects in Naes 's partly looted tomb are more numerous and of purer gold than those of discovered in the undisturbed tomb of Iufaa at Albusir ( NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC , November 1998 ) . The governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Nile Valley . Zed-Khons-uef-ankh seems to have ruled well and earned favor . We hope to learn more when we find his mother 's burial chamber-she must be nearby . With luck we 'll complete the family tree . MORE ON OUR WEBSITE See more of Governor Zed-Khons-uef  --  ankh 's tomb online at nationalgeo graphic.com/ngm/0109 . Footnote <p>
