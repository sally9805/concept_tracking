<p> A federal judge ruled yesterday that the National Football League 's rule restricting younger players from entering the draft was in violation of antitrust laws , opening the way for Maurice Clarett , the Ohio State running back , to be eligible for the draft this year . <p> Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the United States District Court in Manhattan struck down the N.F.L. rule , which prohibits players from entering the draft until three years after they graduate from high school . <p> The league , which said it would appeal the decision , had contended that Clarett had no legal standing to file the lawsuit . The N.F.L. 's lawyers also said the eligibility rule was reasonable because it prevented younger , less physically mature players from entering the league too soon and getting hurt . <p> But Judge Scheindlin , in a 71-page decision laden with football metaphors and allusions , said the N.F.L. had failed to justify Clarett 's exclusion from the draft , and she found that the league 's draft restriction amounted to a restraint of trade . <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Clarett said yesterday at a news conference in Manhattan . " It will give kids an opportunity to choose their own path , as they do in every other sport . " Clarett would not say what he planned to do next . Page D1 . <p> If upheld on appeal , the ruling could have broad implications for the N.F.L. , the National Collegiate Athletic Association and high school sports . In basketball , baseball and hockey , athletes can jump directly from the playground to the professional ranks . Similar court rulings in those sports helped make it possible for teenagers to join elite professional leagues right after high school . <p> Judge Scheindlin 's decision could open the door for football players to make a similar leap , including the 20-year-old Clarett , who sued the N.F.L. in September . Clarett contended that the eligibility rule , which would have prevented him from entering the draft until 2005 , represented a restraint of trade and an antitrust violation . <p> As a freshman running back in the 2002 season , Clarett helped lead Ohio State to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspended for the 2003 season in September for having received benefits worth thousands of dollars and having lied to investigators . Clarett filed the lawsuit two weeks after his suspension . <p> Clarett and his lawyer , Alan C. Milstein , declined to say whether he would apply immediately for the draft , although Jeff Pash , the N.F.L. 's chief counsel , said he had already done so . <p> " I think it 's a terrific decision , well-reasoned , complete , and I think it 's an historic moment in sports , " Milstein said of Judge Scheindlin 's ruling in a telephone interview yesterday . " I 'm not surprised at the decision . I think it is correct and it is justice at work . It is exactly what the court needed to say . " <p> Pash said he was surprised by the ruling , but confident that an appeal could be won . <p> " The eligibility rule is protected by the collective bargaining agreement , " Pash said in a conference call . " We do think it 's a very strong appellate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Pash also said that unless Judge Scheindlin 's ruling is quickly reversed , " Mr. Clarett would be eligible to be drafted . " Pash acknowledged that the appeals process could take at least several months , and added , " He has asked to be included in the draft and the judge has specifically ordered that he be eligible . " <p> Should the N.F.L. win its appeal after Clarett were drafted , Pash said , he would remain in the league . <p> " Once he 's in the draft , if Maurice Clarett is selected and signs a contract , he is in the N.F.L. , " Pash said . <p> Lawyers for the N.F.L. had argued in the case that federal antitrust laws did not apply to the draft eligibility rule . They said the rule was exempt from the antitrust laws because it was part of the league 's collective bargaining agreement with the players ' union . <p> But Judge Scheindlin said the N.F.L. had failed to justify Clarett 's exclusion from the draft , and she found that the rule that kept him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Because the N.F.L. can not prevail on any of these defenses , the rule must be sacked , " Judge Scheindlin wrote . <p> " Indeed , " she said in the decision , " Clarett has alleged the very type of injury  --  a complete bar to entry into the market for his services  --  that the antitrust laws are designed to prevent . " <p> The ruling had other immediate ramifications for the league . <p> According to Pash , underclassmen who did not apply for the draft by the league-imposed Jan. 15 deadline will now be given a chance to do so . <p> " In order to be faithful to the ruling , there will be a new opportunity to apply to the draft within a reasonable time frame , and teams can do due diligence and look at film and prepare for the draft , " Pash said . " We 're looking at identifying the right set of procedures and will have some guidance in the next day or so . " <p> Scheindlin 's ruling prompted strong reaction from lawyers and athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a guard with the Detroit Lions and a member of the union 's executive committee , said the decision to enter the draft should be up to Clarett . But Brown also spoke of potential pitfalls . <p> " I 'm not sure if he 's mentally ready , but guys are getting younger and younger and I do n't think anyone should be denied a chance to make a living , " Brown said by telephone from San Jose , Calif . " But once he makes that decision , he has to realize that he ca n't go back . That 's my primary concern . These are grown men trying to take care of their families . The league spits guys out every year . " <p> Brown , an 18-year veteran , said he did not believe the lawsuit would make the 6-foot , 230-pound Clarett a target of other players or hurt his standing among the league executives who will consider drafting him . <p> " Now that his hat has been thrown in the ring , somebody is going to take a chance on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brown said . " The fact is , what he 's shown in a big-time college program gives him some credibility on the next level . Who knows , he may get better because he does n't have to go to class and wo n't have to stay within the N.C.A.A. rules . He may be the kid that breaks the mold . <p> " Just looking at him , physically , he looks like he can play in the N.F.L. " <p> Harris Barton , the former San Francisco 49ers ' offensive lineman , said he disagreed with Judge Scheindlin 's ruling . <p> " I think the N.F.L. was trying to protect these kids , making them stay in school , get an education , " Barton said during the AT &T; Pebble Beach National Pro-Am . " I think that was the right thing to do . It 's a shame that the courts ruled like that , but the precedent was set in the N.B.A. and baseball . That 's the way it works .

Having said that , I think that rule has been very good in terms of the N.F.L. I think playing in the N.F.L. is a whole lot different for a high school kid going pro , skipping college , than it is for any other sport . <p> " If you see these kids trying it , they 're either going to get hurt , or they 're not going to be successful . " <p> Opinions in legal circles were equally firm  --  and divided . <p> " Crazy , " Gary Roberts , the director of the sports law program at Tulane University , said of Judge Scheindlin 's ruling . " The labor exemption is just about as clear as can be on this point . " Roberts added that he would be shocked if the ruling was upheld on appeal . <p> Robert A. McCormick , a law professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the case , disagreed . " She decided correctly that this is not the sort of thing exempted from antitrust law , " he said . " This is a 100 percent vindication for our argument . " <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
