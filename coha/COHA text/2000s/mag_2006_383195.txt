Twenty women of all ages reveal their fashion rites of passage-when they gave up minis and when they bought their first suits . Plus the 53 items that every woman should own regardless of her age // Rachel Roy , 32 , designer " Jeans will always be appropriate for women of all ages . But I will not wear any trendy jeans . The best are vintage Levi 's , as they are age-appropriate through a lifetime . They are the original denim . " Jill Kargman , 31 , writer " I stopped wearing short skirts when I was 21-I wince at the lengths of my youth ( move over , Paris Hilton ) , but I had killer gams back then . They 've widened in the nine years since . I still wear sexy stilettos ; I 've been practicing since my childhood raids of my mom 's shoe closet , and even the four-inchers feel like Keds to me now . At 20 I gave up on wearing jeans because everyone was wearing them . The trend exploded and I felt like it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now-I have n't worn pants at all in eight years except on the ski slopes ! " Lauren Davis , 30 , fashion consultant " I do n't think anyone should wear sneakers . I was once told that the only people who run are children and thieves . I wore a suit on my first day of work , when I was 25 . Why I waited until after I got the job to bust out the suit I 'm not sure , but I am certain that it was a mistake and will never try it again . Girls under 30 should n't wear real jewels . They look ridiculous . But then again , women over 40 should not wear costume jewelry . Only the real thing ! " Olivia Chantecaille , 30s , creative director of Chantecaille Beaut " I began wearing suits in my 20s , when I discovered the casual elegance of a Chanel suit . I did n't start wearing stilettos until my 20s because I was taller than the boys when I was growing up . Bare arms are beautiful at any age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best when you have Brazilian blood ! Shimmery lip gloss is perfect when you 're in your teens , but it should be retired by your 50s . Time to pass the baton to your daughter . " Ivanka Trump , 24 , VP of development for the Trump Organization " I started wearing short skirts very early in life and have no immediate plans to stop ! I just got into suits this past year , when I joined the real-estate-development team of the Trump Organization . I gave up sneakers when I was 12 because I can run faster in flats . I began to wear pearls and dangly earrings the year I transitioned from asking for toys to asking for jewelry for Christmas . " Nicole Farhi , 59 , designer " I began wearing jeans when I was 18 because they represented freedom and antiestablishment , and I 've never worn suits because they are too serious . I stopped wearing my hair very long when I was 40ish because I looked too young from the back and too old from the front . " Liz Goldwyn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ positively vulgar is showing the belly button when you 're not wearing a bikini-unless you are under 10 years old . I think the stomach area is okay to show , like women did in the 1940s when they wore playsuits with shorts , but the belly button should be covered . Always . It is only recently that I 've felt comfortable wearing more body-conscious clothing , perhaps more sophisticated or sexy attire . Maybe it is more appropriate when one feels more womanly ? It would be a boring world if people used guidelines to dress-no room for creativity or disaster ! " Marjorie Gubelmann Raein , 36 , co-founder of Vie Luxe " I stopped carrying an It bag when I was 28 because I became an Herms addict . Ten years before that I gave up sneakers because I was not an athlete . I restrained myself from wearing pearls , cuffs , and dangly earrings when I was 24 because the ' ' 80s and early ' ' 90s were over ! " Jamee Gregory , 50s , author " I 'm a firm believer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and style that count . A woman of any age should know her body and the proportions that suit her , never following trends . Since I 'm tall and slim I never wear narrow cigarette jeans but prefer some flare for balance . I 've never stopped wearing jeans . They look elegant with jackets and are great for country weekends and travel . Obviously , rips and exposed belly buttons are reserved for teenagers . Chic leather and suede sneakers from Tod 's and Hogan flatter any city look with trousers when you walk 40 blocks downtown as often as I do . " Milly de Cabrol , 40 , interior decorator " Once you are over 40 you should wear only dark straight-leg classic jeans , as in Armani and classic Levi 's . I love wearing suits . You can wear them during the day and dress them up at night with a great shirt and heels . I especially love Dolce &; Gabbana and YSL suits . You can never go wrong with a well-cut suit . And after 40 , no shorts ! " Veronica @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to worry too much getting up in the morning about what to put on , so I throw on jeans . I started wearing them at 3 months-OshKosh ! I have never worn a suit ; I 've always thought that they made me feel too old , and they 're not comfortable . I am lucky being a designer ; I do n't have to follow a strict dress code as I would if I were a lawyer or worked in a bank . I have never really liked the concept of the one bag per season . My nicest bag is my red Herms Birkin that my parents gave me for my 30th birthday . " Gail Elliott , 42 , model and designer of Little Joe " I started wearing sneakers in the last few years , but only Converse . I 'm not really a sneaker kind of person . I stopped wearing short skirts when I was in my late 20s because it did n't feel appropriate anymore . When I see photographs of myself from a few years ago backstage at fashion shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses , I 'm amazed I used to dress that way , but it felt good at the time . I just would n't want all the attention now . " Rebecca Taylor , 36 , designer " I stopped baring my arms when I was 35 for obvious reasons-and banished bare legs when I was 25 because some things are best left to the imagination . I stopped cutting my hair really short when I was 27 because the Rosemary 's Baby look gets less cute and more scary the older you get . " Ann Dexter-Jones , 50s , writer " I stopped wearing really high stilettos when 1 broke my toe in a fall in France and landed on the stone floor of a farmhouse-it was a painful but scenic fall . I wear more medium-height heels now . I also wear sneakers . Not my favorite look unless they are white . I never stopped buying or wearing what I liked because of my age . " Annelise Peterson , 27 publicist at Calvin Klein " I started wearing suits when I went on my first job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an age-appropriate style that can be sexy and modern at any age . I began wearing short skirts when I was 18 and realized that skinny legs were not a bad thing , although I am not a fan of women in their 30s wearing minis . As you get older , showing less is more . " Rashida Jones , 30 , actress " I started wearing sexy stilettos when I was 20 because I realized how easy it was to look instantly hot . I still struggle weekly with whether the hotness is worth the pain . People in Los Angeles dress like 13-year-old Barbie dolls , even the mothers . That makes the city an odd , homogeneous tableau of terry-cloth pastels , faux-vintage tees , Uggs , and blonde hair . I prefer New York because people , for the most part , take more fashion chances . " Gela Taylor , 44 , co-designer of Juicy Couture " I will stop mixing it up and wear suits when I run for president . Will you vote for me ? I started wearing sexy stilettos when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a high heel on a cement floor , and I still wear them ! " Catherine Malandrino , 40 , designer " I discontinued wearing sneakers in my 20s and replaced them with ballerinas ; they 're much more feminine . I never wore business suits ; they are always too stiff and formal for me . I began to wear le smoking for evening in my 20s and still wear them now . " Shoshanna LonsteinCruss , 30 , designer " I wore a school uniform for 13 years , so I could wear jeans only on weekends . I had two pairs of Levi 's 501s . I still have them and wear them . I think they are timeless and are always going to be great for weekends in the country or going to the park with my daughter . I ca n't imagine giving up jeans . Maybe I will when I do n't fit into my old Levi 's anymore . I think suits can have a very aging look . Whenever young girls come to interview at my office and wear a suit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cynthia Rowley , 40s , designer " Even my 94-year-old grandmother wears jeans with cute sneakers . ( The older you get , the more fashionable your sneakers should be-no running shoes or Rockports . ) You do n't ever need to stop wearing jeans . Jeans can be great camouflage and very forgiving . When I hear the word suit , I think of career separates with suntan panty hose . If you 're going to wear a suit , it should be really expensive and sexy , no matter your age : a fitted jacket , skinny trousers , and great shoes . They may have told you in college to buy your first suit for job interviews , but you really do n't need one . As you get older , shorts are best at the beach . I would never wear shorts on the streets of New York . The rules do n't apply if you take care of yourself ( or are lucky enough to have good genes ) .
