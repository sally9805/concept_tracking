Confessions of a New Testament teacher TABLE <p> ITS THE TOUGHEST JOB you 'll ever love . And no , it 's not the Marine Corps . Teaching an introductory course in New Testament can be worthy of combat pay . This is especially true when most of the students are Christian . <p> Biblical scholars and their students have very different presuppositions regarding the Bible . If I could explain these presuppositions to my students , I thought , then we could begin to communicate . This strategy eased tensions tremendously . My students began to understand my reasons for making certain moves in interpretation and textbook selection . Nevertheless , teaching Christianity 's sacred texts to Christians can be dangerous  --  a danger I try to deal with by structuring my New Testament course in a certain way . <p> Two new introductory textbooks for New Testament studies help clarify why I organize my course as I do . Delbert Burkett uses the historical-critical method as a means of reconstructing early Christian life and faith . Paul J. Achtemeier , Joel B. Green and Marianne Meye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the church . Thompson 's syllabus includes a statement on the course 's relevance for ministry . <p> I have a particular preference  --  actually a bias  --  regarding how a course in New Testament should be taught , and I begin my course by making that preference clear . Like Burkett , I practice the historical-critical method . This means that I read scripture with an eye toward how the text fits into its larger historical context . There are , of course , other ways scriptural texts can be read : for their literary and aesthetic value , for example , or as a model for determining how one should conduct one 's life , which is the way most of my students read scripture . They are concerned with what the text means , whereas I am concerned with what the text meant . Acknowledging this difference is important because it informs the instructor 's theological perspective and has implications for her pedagogical style . <p> Achtemeier , Green and Thompson structure their book around their joint preference for studying the New Testament primarily as " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaping Christian belief and practice . " They approach the New Testament as a body of literature with a theological content that has meaning for the modern reader . By contrast , Burkett structures his work around his preference for historical investigation . This explains why his book begins with a chapter that emphasizes " the differences between the historical-critical method and the confessional method of studying the New Testament . " <p> Though Burkett attempts to bring modern relevance to his investigation by adding discussion questions at the end of each chapter , these questions are few and far between . Bridging the chasm between past and present is difficult , and his book only underscores that difficulty . I prefer Burkett 's method over Achtemeier , Green and Thompson 's , but that does n't mean I would n't use the latter work at all . If I used it , however , I would probably define my perspective over against that of the authors . <p> After explaining my perspective , I have to clarify what I want my New Testament course to accomplish . This breaks down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want the course to be an introduction to the discipline of biblical scholarship , or do I want it to be an introduction to the New Testament texts ? An introduction to the discipline involves familiarizing students with the history of interpretation and its present practitioners . An introduction to the texts involves orienting students to the various types of literature that make up the New Testament , and the claims or arguments of each . The lectures in my introductory courses are aimed at acquainting students with the texts themselves , while the textbooks I choose introduce them to the discipline . <p> Second , do I want this course to be an exercise in intellectual or in theological formation ? Emphasizing intellectual formation means making connections between this body of literature and the wider project of humanistic inquiry . Theological formation means looking at the New Testament as a document of the church meant for the edification of practitioners of the faith . Since I teach students working for their master of divinity degrees , I want the course to be an exercise in theological formation and thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a basic document that informs preaching , teaching , counseling and administration . They should view it as a resource for constructing modem theological claims . <p> BURKETT 'S BOOK is more of an introduction to the discipline . It discusses such issues as the two-document hypothesis , the quest for the historical Jesus , proto-orthodoxy in the New Testament and the authorship of the disputed Pauline letters . In addition , it includes discussions of various noncanonical Christian materials , including the apocryphal gospels ( e.g. , the Infancy Gospel of Thomas ) . This gives the reader a broader perspective on Christianity as a historical movement involving various manifestations of the faith . It complicates our understanding of Christianity 's development because it follows the historian 's method of not privileging an orthodox theological perspective . Thus , it is an exercise in intellectual formation . Because Burkett , associate professor of religious studies ( New Testament and early Christianity ) at Louisiana State University , teaches in a liberal arts setting , he is obligated to make connections between these Christian documents and other forms of humanistic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Union Theological Seminary and Presbyterian School of Christian Education in Virginia , Asbury Theological Seminary and Fuller Theological Seminary , respectively  --  teach at freestanding seminaries devoted to ministerial formation and theological thinking . Their introduction reflects this environment . Though it discusses some of the same disciplinary issues found in Burkett 's book , it is an exercise in theological thinking , Their book intentionally gives privileged place to textual engagement over disciplinary analysis . Both books are balanced in their presentations of scholarly material , but their fundamental orientations ultimately determine how that material is to be read in relation to the New Testament documents themselves . In this instance , I would be more likely to choose Achtemeier , Green and Thompson over Burkett because I teach in an environment that has more in common with theirs than with Burkett 's . <p> The third thing I do when teaching a course in New Testament is to " guesstimate " my students ' interest in the topic . Some students have a purely confessional interest . That is , they want to see how the New Testament can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a more professional interest . They want to be equipped to negotiate and apply the basic documents that constitute the core of Christian faith and proclamation . Still others have more intellectual interests . They are intrigued by why the New Testament says what it does on questions important to human existence generally . And , finally , some students are resistant to any academic approach to biblical interpretation whatsoever . These students are interested in theological education only because their denominations require it for ordination . This is the toughest group of students to teach . They do n't want to be in your classroom , and they let you know it . Enticing them into an interest in New Testament studies can be difficult . Yet this is my target group . If I can interest them , then the rest of the class will find their interests met in the process . <p> Achtemeier , Green and Thompson attempt to address students who have a keen interest in the New Testament because they are committed to Christian thinking and practice . Burkett has a much tougher job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the New Testament is meaningful to their overall educational experience . He makes the study of the New Testament an entirely intellectual matter . This is reflected in statements such as , " In an academic setting ... we treat Christianity , Islam , Hinduism , and all other religions in the same way : we seek to understand them , not necessarily to adopt or practice them . " I prefer this aspect of Burkett 's approach to Achtemeier , Green and Thompson 's because my goal is to interest those students who do not see the relevance of studying the New Testament for their lives and ministries . Take , for example , the student interested in social-justice issues . She may see the New Testament as oppressive , reflecting the biases and interests of certain ancient elites ( i.e. , literate individuals who own commodious dwellings and support patriarchal social institutions ) . If this student can be convinced that the foundational Christian documents can be interpreted in ways that address modem social concerns , then these documents can take their rightful place as an indispensable source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a basis for this approach in ways that Achtemeier , Green and Thompson 's do not . <p> FINALLY , I TRY in my course to create an environment in which a " fusion of horizons " can take place . In my vision of the ideal teaching environment my scholarly preferences , my goals for the course and my students ' interests would come together . This fusion does not necessarily solve all classroom problems . And some classroom tension is good . It keeps us on our toes . It also allows us to move among a variety of perspectives . I tell students that conversion to my perspective is not the goal of my courses , nor do I want them to uncritically adopt the perspective of the textbook . I want them to see both me and the textbook as critical conversation partners for their own perspectives . You could say that my vision for an introductory course is discordia concors , the harmony or unity gained by combining disparate and conflicting elements . <p> I must admit that this fusion of horizons does not always occur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an introductory course in New Testament would be first , ora et labora ( pray and work ) , and second , provide a resource for students that can be reengaged later in their lives . To pray may sound like an odd piece of advice from a historical critic , but just because the efficacy of prayer can not be critically analyzed does not mean that I exclude its revelatory capacity from my life . Prayer in conjunction with action forms a dynamic framework for teaching . <p> The right textbook can be an invaluable resource for students later in life . I may not be able to create the best environment for critical inquiry for every student . However , I hope that by selecting the right textbook I give my students an opportunity to engage the New Testament on their own . For many , this Will be the only introductory work on the New Testament they will ever own and read . It is important that the text include resources for further study . Again , here I would choose Burkett over Achtemeier , Green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for further consideration . But I can not say conclusively that I will adopt Burkett for my course , nor would I reject the other textbook entirely . Both provide certain perspectives on the conduct of New Testament scholarship that are crucial for the successful creation and execution of an introductory course . <p> By Michael Joseph Brown <p> <p> Michael Joseph Brown is assistant professor of New Testament at Emory University 's Candler School of Theology in Atlanta and author of What They Do n't Tell You : A Survivor 's Guide to Biblical Studies ( Westminster John Knox ) . <p>
