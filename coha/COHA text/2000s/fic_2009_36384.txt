Spade 's Last Case <p> It was thirteen minutes short of midnight . Drizzle glinted through the wind-danced lights on the edge of the Tacoma Municipal Dock . A man a few years shy of thirty stood in a narrow aisle between two tall stacks of crated cargo , almost invisible in a black hooded rain slicker . He had a long bony jaw , a flexible mouth , a jutting chin . His nose was hooked . He was six feet tall , with broad , steeply sloping shoulders . <p> He stayed in the shadows while the scant dozen passengers disembarked from the wooden-hulled steam-powered passenger ferry Virginia V , just in from Seattle via the Colvos Passage . His cigarette was cupped in one palm as if to shield it from the rain , or perhaps to conceal its glowing ember from watching eyes . <p> The watcher stiffened when the last person off the Virginia V was a solid , broad-shouldered man in his late thirties , dressed in a brown woolen suit . His red heavy-jawed face was made for joviality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The passenger went quickly along the dock toward a narrow passageway that led to the city street beyond . The watcher , well behind , ambled after him . The first man had started through the passageway when he was jumped by two bulky , shadowy figures . There were grunts of effort , curses , the sound of blows , the scrape of leather soles on wet cobbles as the men struggled . <p> The watcher announced his arrival by jamming his lighted cigarette into the eye of one attacker . The man screamed , stumbled unevenly away holding a hand over his eye . The second attacker broke free and fled . <p> " ' Lo , Miles . " <p> Miles Archer , holding a handkerchief to his bloodied nose , said thickly through the bunched-up cloth , " Uh ... thanks , Sam . " <p> " Wobblies ? " asked Sam Spade . <p> " Wobblies . Who else ? " <p> They went down the passageway toward the street . Archer was limping . He had the thick neck and slightly soft middle of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally made you as undercover for Burns ? " <p> " Took ' em long enough , " Archer bragged . He looked over at Spade . " Back with Continental , huh ? Uh ... ? how 'd you find me ? " <p> " Was n't looking . Was staked out for a redheaded paper hanger out of Victoria . " <p> " I saw him miss the ferry in Seattle . " <p> Spade nodded , put a smile on his face that did not touch his eyes . " Belated congratulations on your marriage , Miles . " <p> " Yeah , uh , thanks , Sam . " Something sly and delighted seemed suddenly to dance in Archer 's heavy , coarse voice . " We 're living over in Spokane so 's she can keep working at Graham 's Bookstore , even though I 'm down here most of the time . Tough on the little lady , but what can she do ? " <p> Spade was at a table set for afternoon tea when the fortyish matron entered from Spokane 's Sprague Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with a mezzanine above and , on the ground floor , an always-burning wood fireplace . When the woman paused in the doorway he stood . His powerful , conical , almost bearlike body kept his gray woolen suit coat from fitting well . <p> She crossed to him . She had wide-set judging eyes and a small , disapproving mouth . <p> " I am Mrs. Hazel Cahill . And you are ... " <p> He gave a slight , almost elegant bow . " Samuel Spade . " <p> Mrs. Cahill set her Spanish-leather handbag on one of the chairs , stripped off her kidskin gloves , and slid them through the bag 's carrying straps . Her movements were measured . She turned slightly so Spade 's thick-fingered hands could remove her coat . <p> She sat . She did not thank him . She said , " Three o'clock last Monday afternoon he and two other men came from this hotel , laughing about their golf scores . My husband , Theodore , and I just moved here from Tacoma a month ago , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw . " <p> " I did n't say you did n't . " <p> " Theodore does . Constantly . " Her head shake danced carefully marcelled curls under her narrow-brimmed hat . " You men always stick together . " <p> Spade nodded with seeming indifference . <p> " Theodore and he were great cronies-golf and tennis , drinks at the club . When he abandoned poor Eleanor five years ago and did n't turn up dead Theodore called him the one who got away . Eleanor is my best friend . She never remarried . " <p> The skylight in the high vaulted ceiling laid a slanted bar of pale afternoon sunlight across one corner of their table . Spade 's raised brows , which peaked slightly above his yellow-gray eyes , encouraged confidences . <p> " Did Eleanor 's husband recognize you ? " <p> " No . And only when they were past did I recognize him , from his voice-a distinctive tenor I 'd always found irritating . " She pursed thin lips and something like malice gleamed in her eyes . " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seen her missing husband here in Spokane . " <p> " And she believed you . Even if your husband does n't . " <p> " My husband never believes me . " <p> " If the man 's here I 'll find him . " <p> After she had gone Spade remained , rolled and smoked three cigarettes in quick succession , muttered aloud , " What the hell ? " and left the hotel . <p> John Graham 's Bookstore was on the corner of Sprague Avenue and West First Avenue , hard by the Davenport Hotel . Spade entered with long strides , slowed as if looking for a particular volume on the crowded shelves . There were a half dozen browsers and an almost pleasant smell of old books in the air . <p> Graham himself , a thin bespectacled man with a trim white mustache and wings of silver hair swept back from either side of his face , was ringing up a sale on the front register . A female clerk was selling a customer a book halfway down the store . <p> Spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a blonde of about his age , pretty verging on beautiful , with an oval face , blue eyes , and a moist red mouth . Her silk-striped woolen rep dress , too fashionable for a shopgirl to wear to work , clung to an exquisite body . <p> The big round blue eyes lit up when she saw Spade . She hurried her sale to just short of rudeness , came up to Spade , raised her face for his kiss . Instead , he put an arm around her shoulders , turned her slightly , kissed her on the cheek . <p> " You did n't tell me you were in town ! " she exclaimed in a slightly hurt voice . <p> " Just for the day , " he lied easily . " On a case . " <p> " And you came into Graham 's for old time 's sake , " she said . " Because we met here . " In that light her eyes looked almost violet . " That first time , you came in to get a book and instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me ! " <p> Spade grunted . " Just as a rental . " <p> " That 's a nasty thing to say to a girl , Sam . " <p> " Not a girl anymore . Not Ida Nolan anymore . " <p> " What did you expect ? You ran off to be a hero in France . " <p> His eyes hardened between down-drawn brows . He said in a sarcastic voice , " I love you , Sam . I 'll wait for you , Sam . " <p> " I got lonely . " <p> " And married Miles Archer three months after I left . " <p> " Miles was here . Miles was eager to marry me . Miles- " <p> " I saw Miles in Tacoma a couple of nights ago , " Spade said . " He thanked me . " <p> She said almost cautiously , " For what ? " <p> " Going into the army . Leaving him an open field . " <p> " He is n't due back from Tacoma until tomorrow ... " <p> " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " To hell with you , Sam Spade , " Iva Archer said viciously . <p> The engines growled and shook ; white water boiled up around the stern of the Eliza Anderson as she backed away from the ramshackle Victoria , British Columbia , slip . Fog , wet as rain , already had swept most of the passengers off the darkening deck into the cabin for their three-hour trip down Puget Sound to Seattle . <p> A dark-haired man just shy of forty turned from the coffee urn with a steaming mug in one hand . He had a trim mustache over a wide mouth , narrow , amused eyes under level brows , a strong jaw , a small faded scar on his left cheek . Before exiting he set down his coffee and cinched up the belt of his ulster . <p> Sam Spade , who had been leaning against the bulkhead midcabin , sauntered out after him . Moisture immediately beaded Spade 's woolen knit cap , the turned-up collar of his mackinaw . <p> The man was standing at the rail , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A glow came into Spade 's eyes . His upper lip twitched in what could have been a smile . He leaned on the railing beside the other man . <p> " Mr. Flitcraft , I presume ? " <p> The man dropped his mug overboard . <p> Charles Pierce slid warily through the doorway like a cat entering a strange room . He relaxed fractionally when he saw a bottle of Johnnie Walker whiskey and two glasses on a tray on the table . Spade was at the sink running water into a pitcher . The room was simple , comfortable , homey , with a private bath . <p> " I want to get this over with , " said Pierce in a high , clear voice . " Not that I have anything to feel guilty about . " <p> They touched glasses . Spade said , " Success to crime . " <p> " There 's no crime involved here . Nothing like that . " <p> Without obvious irony Spade said , " Five years ago , in 1916 , a man named Robert Flitcraft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate office to go to luncheon , he made an engagement for a round of golf at four o'clock that afternoon . He did n't keep the engagement . Nobody ever saw him again . " <p> Pierce downed half his drink . Spade 's hands had been rolling a cigarette . He lit it , looked through the drifting smoke with candid eyes . <p> " The police got nowhere . Flitcraft 's wife came to our Seattle office . She said she and her husband were on good terms , said they had two boys , five and three , said he drove a new Packard , said he had a successful real estate business and a net worth of two hundred thousand dollars . I was assigned to the case . I could find no secret vices , no other woman , no hidden bank accounts , no sign Flitcraft had been putting his affairs in order . He vanished with no more than fifty bucks in his pocket . He was just gone , like your lap when you stand up . " <p> " What he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I went into the army in nineteen seventeen he was still missing . Last week his wife came in to tell us a friend of hers had seen him here in Spokane . " <p> Spade rubbed his jutting chin as if checking his shave . <p> " Now we have Charles Pierce living in a Spokane suburb with his wife of two years and an infant son . He sells new cars , nets twenty-five thousand a year , belongs to the country club , plays golf most afternoons at four o'clock during the season . His wife does n't look like Flitcraft 's wife , but they 're more alike than different . Afternoon bridge , salad recipes ... " <p> Pierce was fidgeting . " What are you getting at ? " <p> " I was sent here to find and identify the man our informant thought was Flitcraft . I 've done that . Charles Pierce is Robert Flitcraft . No definite instructions beyond that , but there 's the bigamy question . Wife here , wife in Tacoma . <p> Kids from both marriages ... " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Of course since you left your first wife extremely well fixed you could claim you thought that after all this time she would have divorced you in absentia - " <p> " I was on my way to lunch . " He paused . " A steel beam fell from a new office building and hit the sidewalk right beside me . " <p> " A beam . " Spade 's voice was without inflection . <p> " A chip of concrete flew up ... " His hand absently touched the faint scar on his left cheek . " I was more shocked than scared . I was a good husband , a good father , I was doing everything right , and none of it meant a damned thing if a beam could fall off a building and kill me . " <p> " As if someone had taken the lid off life and let you see how it really worked ? " Spade pinched his lower lip , frowned , drew his brows together . " No logic , no fairness , only chance . " His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with what you thought was life you got out of step with real life . " <p> " You do get it ! I decided that if my life was merely a collection of random incidents , I would live it randomly . That afternoon I went to Seattle , caught a boat to San Francisco . For the next few years I wandered around and finally ended up back in the Northwest . I got a chance to buy into an auto dealership here in Spokane , met my wife , got married , had a son ... " He grinned almost sheepishly . " I like the climate . " <p> " Three things not in my report , " said Spade . <p> Ralph Dudley , resident supervisor of Continental 's Seattle office , was in his seventies , fifty years on the job , white of mustache , pink of face . His kindly eyes behind rimless spectacles were misleading ; they never changed expression , not even when he sent his ops out to face danger , sometimes death . <p> " First item , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Flitcraft disappeared Mrs. Cahill made a play for him . An affair would n't have fit in with his view of what the good citizen-husband-father did so he turned her down . She did n't like that . So when she spotted him in Spokane she could n't wait to try and make as much trouble for him as she could . " <p> Dudley said in mild-voiced skepticism , " I see . " <p> " Second item . Flitcraft was afraid his first wife would n't get what he did . She did n't . She just figures he played a dirty trick on her so she 's going to get a quiet divorce . " Merriment lit his face . " Flitcraft does n't get it either . He adjusted to falling beams . When no more beams fell he adjusted back again . " <p> " You mentioned three things , Spade . " <p> " Flitcraft is my last case . " <p> Dudley turned his swivel chair to stare out the window . Half a dozen mosquito-fleet ferries were churning their various ways across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green rectangle of Blake Island . <p> Dudley told the window , " In nineteen seventeen you could n't wait for us to get into the war . Disregarding my direct order , you went over the border to enlist in the First Canadian Division . " He turned to look at Spade . " While training in England you took up competitive pistol shooting . You made some records . " <p> " The pistol made the records . All I did was point it and make it go bang , " said Spade . " Eight-shot thirty-eight Webley-Fosbery automatic revolver . Only three hundred of them ever got made because they jammed in combat , but they were so accurate on the firing range they got banned from competition shooting . " <p> Dudley went on coldly as if Spade had n't spoken . <p> " You were assigned to the Seventh Battalion of the Second Infantry Brigade and saw action in the trenches of the Lens- ? Arras sector of France . You were wounded . You got a medal . Upon your return , against my better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took on a nasty edge . " A competitive pistol shot , a war hero , and suddenly you do n't like guns . Suddenly you 're quitting the detective trade . Do you mind telling me why ? Or have you just lost your stomach for real man 's work ? " <p> Spade stood . He did not offer his hand . <p> " I think if you need to use a gun you 're doing a lousy job as a detective . As for resigning , I do n't like the work here much since the war . Too much head knocking , not enough door knocking . And who says I 'm quitting the detective trade ? " <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
