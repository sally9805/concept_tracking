The election of President Pervez Musharraf 's candidate for Prime Minister of Pakistan is a big victory for Musharraf , and for U.S. efforts to retain Pakistan 's support in the war against terror . Zafarullah Khan Jamali , 58 , a tribal chieftain from Baluchistan , narrowly defeated his closest rival , a pro-Taliban preacher . But his slim , one-vote majority reeked of political bullying and dealmaking . It was an arrangement rigged outside Parliament , struck in lengthy telephone calls to an exiled politician hoping for a comeback and , a losing candidate claims , tainted by bribes and threats . <P> Since Pakistan 's parliamentary elections in October , Musharraf has faced growing opposition in the National Assembly . Jamali 's party , the Pakistan Muslim League ( Quaid ) , which Musharraf hoped would do his bidding , fell far short of a majority , and the President has had to contend with angry anti-American clergymen and wily old pols from parties that he tried to crush . <P> Benazir Bhutto , the exiled former Prime Minister and leader of the Pakistan People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In a challenge to Musharraf , Bhutto was prepared to cast aside her pro-Western views and instruct her party to back the Islamic religious parties ' candidate for Prime Minister , Maulana Fazlur Rehman . Musharraf moved fast . First , his aides released Bhutto 's husband Asif Ali Zardari from his hospital jail , where he had been held on charges of corruption , and allowed him to visit his dying mother in Karachi . <P> At one stage , a government source says , Musharraf 's political fixers tried to win over Bhutto by offering to drop corruption charges against her and her husband . Under the deal , the insider says , Zardari would be freed and sent into exile while Bhutto would be allowed back into Pakistan after two years to resume politics . In the end , losing ppp candidate Shah Mahmood Quereshi has alleged publicly , Musharraf turned to simpler tactics : using threats and bribes to persuade a few of Bhutto 's assemblymen to switch loyalties and vote for Jamali.  --  By Tim McGirk           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
