That skinny eleven-year-old boy sitting across the table from me with the wispy dishwater-blond hair and glasses , that 's my twin brother , Milo , short for Myles . He 's got his long nose pointed down where his physics books and sheets scribbled with mathematical equations are neatly lined up at 180-degree angles on his end of the table . This is where Milo is likely to stay until bedtime ( even though Mom says we have to study only until four o'clock ) , mumbling to himself and moving his face closer and closer to his work and getting more and more fidgety , until he 's reaching for his inhaler . Then Mom makes him stop for the day and go to bed . <br> Milo is " profoundly gifted . " One of those scary-smart geniuses who could have started college while still in diapers . Milo is going to be a physicist one day . His dream is to get a paper on string theory published in the globally renowned journals Nature and Physical Review and to prove some startling theory in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leading geeks in the physics field . <br> Mom had me tested when she sent Milo , but I know it was for no other reason than that she did n't want me to feel left out . Same as she had the eye doctor give me a Sponge- Bob SquarePants sticker when Milo got his last eye exam , even though my eyes are as sharp as a hawk 's , and even though I did n't know who the little character was . We were six when we took that test . Mom hid the results when they came , but it was n't hard to figure out where she 'd hidden them , since she puts all of her important papers in one place : her file cabinet , in a folder marked Important Papers . <br> " Do n't be disappointed , " Mom told me when she found me sitting on my knees alongside the file cabinet , staring down at our scores : Lucy Marie McGowan  --  144 . Myles Clay McGowan  --  180 . " You have a photographic memory and you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequately measure either trait . If they did , you 'd have scored every bit as high as your brother . " Later that day , she handed me a quote by Albert Einstein that she had jotted on an index card : Everything that can be counted does not necessarily count ; everything that counts can not necessarily be counted . <br> Milo and I are homeschooled . Mom says it 's because we have special needs and would only fall through the cracks in a public school system . But in reality , it 's because we 'd have to go to an inner city school here in Chicago because there 's no money for a private school for the gifted , and she 's afraid that Milo would get knifed or shot on the playground for being a freak and a geek . She 's also afraid that if people knew just how smart he is , he 'd be hounded by the press and doctors and develop mental problems , which would be an easy thing to do , since the experts believe that profoundly gifted kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one right ! ) . And , of course , I have to be homeschooled if Milo has to be . <br> Mom agrees that I should become a psychologist when I grow up , and either get into people 's heads and cure what ails them or test and study gifted kids . Not because she has a particular fondness for shrinks  --  she does n't !  --  but because she believes that kids should be steered in the direction of their gifts , and I happen to be people-smart . <br> After I convinced Mom that my interest lies in human behavior , she started checking out psychology textbooks from the college library for me : social and personality psychology , cognitive and experimental psychology , abnormal psychology , clinical psychology , you name it . I enjoy the parts of them I can understand , but like Carl Jung said , " Anyone who wants to know the human psyche will learn next to nothing from experimental psychology . He would be better advised to abandon exact science , put away his scholar 's gown , bid farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . " I know I learn more by studying live people . Not that I have many people to study , mind you , because for the most part we live like recluses . So I watch my mother and my grandmother , the people who sit on the stoop downstairs on the rare days we leave the apartment , and sometimes Milo . Undoubtedly , though , study- ing Milo would be more beneficial if I were going to be a botanist . <br> When I told Mom that I 'd like to become a psychologist ( although I 'd rather be a figure skater , even if I do have weak ankles and my balance is n't up to par . And even if I do n't know how to skate , period , much less do a double axel or a triple lutz ) , she brought me home a little present that I know was meant to show me that she supports my decision . " I know how much you 've always liked puppets , " she said when I opened the cloth Sigmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They have magnets on the back , so you can stick them to your computer tower . " <br> Milo got upset when I put Sigmund on my index finger and bobbed him in front of his face , asking him if he thought that having an overprotective , overanxious mother was what made him such a sissy . He punched me in the arm for teasing him , but it did n't hurt , because Milo is even smaller than I am and his fist is only about the size of a walnut . <br> In all honesty , if I ca n't be a figure skater , and if I have to cure people of what ails them , I 'd rather be a shaman . My grandmother , Lillian , snuck me a book about a shaman in Africa . I thought it was cool the way he traveled to the underworlds in search of the missing pieces of people 's souls to heal them . <br> Mom got upset when she found the book tucked under the dirty clothes in my hamper . " Take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she snapped . " And stop filling Lucy 's mind with that crazy crap . " My grandmother scoffed at her , saying , " What a shaman does is every bit as real as the shadow at our feet , our breath in winter . " Unfortunately , there 's no school that gives a degree in Shamanism . And , anyway , where would I set up my practice ? I 'd probably have to go to a remote village in some Third World country and risk dying from cholera or dysentery and get paid in dead chickens , not money . That would suck , because being poor sucks . <br> Besides worrying about our education and Milo 's mental and physical well-being and me getting a complex because I 'm not as smart as my brother , Mom worries about us running out of money . Every time I bring up the mail from downstairs , she looks at me like I 'm carrying in a poison- ous snake , wrinkles her nose , and says , " Just set it on the kitchen table , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courage to open the bills . <br> It 's because of our money situation that Mom sold out and started writing Christian romance novels , even though her love is literary fiction and even though she 's an atheist who happens to be bitter about love . What was she supposed to do , though , after she sold her first novel , The Absent Savior , three years ago , to a prestigious press on the East Coast and it sold only four hundred eleven copies ? It did n't earn enough to allow us to buy a frikkin ' case of boxed macaroni and cheese , Mom said , so she scrapped her second work-in-progress and started writing Christian romance , with her sights set on the Wal-Mart market , which is where the big bucks are . She 's ashamed of writing them , so she is n't using her real name , Tess McGowan , but instead uses the pen name Jennifer Dollman . Her advance reader copies are still sitting in a box in her closet , unopened . <br> Last month we stopped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pool  --  a rare treat , brought on only because of my grandmother 's sudden , not completely irrational fear that Milo was suffering from a vitamin D deficiency because he wo n't drink milk and does n't play outside in the sun . Never mind that Milo does n't play , period , and that there 's no place to play outside our apartment but the street , even if he did . We were almost to the checkout line when Milo happened to spot Mom 's Christian romance on a cardboard display at the end of the aisle . He pointed to it and said , " Look , Mom , your book ! " He grabbed a copy and ran his fingertips over Mom 's pen name and said , " Jennifer Dollman , that 's you ! " Some lady behind us in a T-shirt that had a picture of Jesus on the cross and the words Follow the Leader stretched across her chest heard him and got all excited . <br> " You 're Jennifer Dollman ? Oh , my gawd ! My book club is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for next month 's selection , and I 'm reading it right now . " And Milo  --  who may have an IQ of 180 but has absolutely no common sense  --  said , " Yes , she 's Jennifer D  --  " <br> Mom clamped her hand over his pale lips and backed away , but the woman rushed forward . It was as if she 'd entered the rapture early , and she could n't stop gushing . She was on chapter seventeen , she said , and she " absolutely adored " the trials and tribulations of Mom 's protagonist , Missy Jenkins , and bless Mom for upholding the sanctity of marriage and not allowing Missy to be sweet-talked into sin by that good-looking philanderer Chase Milford . Mom quickly told the woman that it was a misunderstanding , her son only meant that it was the same book that is sitting on her nightstand . The woman started to protest , her finger wagging over Milo 's head . " But he said  --  " <br> " No . No . The author and I share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My son . . . he 's . . . he 's learning disabled . " <br> Mom almost yanked Milo 's poor little arm out of its socket as she dragged us out of the store , Milo shouting , " Learning disabled ? You called me learning disabled ? " the whole way , the sunscreen left on the candy shelf for some weary-footed employee to march back to the pharmaceutical department . When we got home , Mom sat us both down and lectured us about not airing our dirty laundry in public . <br> " Can we tell people that you edit academic books ? " I asked , and Mom said we could . <br> " What about your articles ? Can we tell them that you 're a travel writer ? " Milo was referring to the many articles Mom writes each year , advising gonna-be travelers on where they should go and what they should see in exotic places like Shanghai , Bali , and even Roatn , that magical island off the coast of Honduras where many go on vacation , then decide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been to any of these places . She gets photographs e-mailed to her by a woman she knew in college who dropped out of school to become a flight attendant . She likes to brag about all the places she 's been by sending Mom photos . Then Mom researches the places online and writes the article . I rolled my eyes at Milo 's question . Milo should have had the sense to figure out that since Mom 's travel articles are every bit as deceptive as her Christian romances , they , too , would be off-limits . <br> Mom has a lot of issues , frankly . And , unfortunately , at least some of them began with the woman who just burst through the door . Her mother , Lillian . And although I do n't know if my grandmother is right and I am truly a bit psychic , I do know the minute she swoops into our apartment on this morning in mid-September that this visit is going to generate more than the usual amount of sparks . <br> Continues ...    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
