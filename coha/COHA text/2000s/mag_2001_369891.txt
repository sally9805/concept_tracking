Like other members of the famous " hominid gang , " the sharp-eyed fossil hunters employed by paleontology 's Leakey family , Justus Erus spends three months a year scouring the dry , bone-rich riverbeds around Lake Turkana , in northern Kenya . It is a scrubby , desolate landscape , where the people are desperately poor and gun-toting young men are a menacing presence . But it is hallowed ground to scientists because of the clues it offers to early human history . Still , even after five years , Erus , a 30-year-old Turkana tribesman , had scored nary a hit  --  just bits of ancient animal bones and teeth . <P> Then one scorching morning during the final week of the gang 's explorations in August 1999 , at a site called Lomekwi , Erus noticed a white object , just an inch or so across , sticking out of a patch of brown mudstone . " I thought maybe it was the bones of a monkey , " he says . Beckoning the expedition 's co-leader , Meave Leakey , wife and daughter-in-law , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own right , he asked her opinion . By nightfall they realized that they had uncovered the partial remains of a humanlike skull . <P> The fossil turned out to be a totally new prehuman species and last week re-ignited one of paleontology 's greatest debates : Did we evolve in direct steps from a common apelike ancestor between 6 million and 4 million years ago ? Or did the human family tree sprout several branches , some of which petered out ? <P> In the past 20 years the Leakeys and others have dug up overwhelming evidence showing that between 2.5 million and 1 million years ago , the then lush woodlands and savannas of eastern Africa  --  where our family tree first took root  --  were the habitat of rival species , most of which were evolutionary dead ends . But what about before that ? Paleontologists have generally agreed that there was just one hominid line , beginning with a small , upright-walking species known as Australopithecus afarensis , most famously represented by " Lucy , " a remarkably complete ( about 40% ) skeleton found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ challenged . The new skull , described by Leakey and six colleagues , including her and Richard 's daughter Louise , 29 , in Nature last week , pushes the presence of coexisting species back another million years , to between 3.5 million and 3.2 million years ago . That 's right in Lucy 's time . Yet it is so different from Lucy that they assign their fossil , which they call Kenyanthropus platyops , or " flat-faced man of Kenya , " to a new genus , or grouping of species . " This means we will have to rethink the early past of hominid evolution , " says Meave Leakey , head of paleontology at the National Museums of Kenya . " It 's clear the picture is n't as simple as we had thought . " Even Lucy 's discoverer , Donald Johanson , director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University , concurs . " This is a reminder that there are probably a lot more species out there , " he says . <P> K. platyops not only had a much flatter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From the teeth , the scientists conclude that it probably ate fruits , berries and small insects while A. afarensis consumed tougher vegetation like roots and grasses . " They were unlikely to compete , " says team member Fred Spoor of University College London . " Two species usually do n't occupy the same ecological niche . "
