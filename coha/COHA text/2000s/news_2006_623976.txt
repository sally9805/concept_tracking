<p> When Rashad Williams was growing up in San Francisco , he was a track star with a future . In 1999 , at age 15 , he turned into a national hero by raising $40,000 for a victim of the Columbine massacre . Last year , he robbed two banks . In December , he died  --  shot to death by a Clearlake man who said his home was being invaded . <p> Rashad Williams was 21 . <p> " I do n't know how I 'm going to deal with this , " said his mother , Sheila Burton . " My child is gone . " <p> For Williams ' friends and family , it is a shocking end to a life that was as improbable as any life could be .  --   --   --  <p> On April 20 , 1999 , two teenagers gunned down 12 fellow students and one teacher at Columbine High School in Littleton , Colo . Twenty-four others were wounded . One of them was 16-year-old Lance Kirklin , who was shot in the chest , face and legs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family did n't have the health insurance to pay for all those operations . <p> Williams , a 15-year-old freshman at Archbishop Riordan High School in San Francisco , decided to do something about it . He was planning to run in the city 's annual Bay to Breakers race  --  why not raise money for Lance while he was doing it ? <p> " He came to me with the Columbine idea , " recalled Marty Procaccio , Williams ' track coach and counselor at Riordan . " He said , ' I have legs , and this kid does n't . ' " <p> Procaccio was surprised by the proposal , but he said it typified Williams . <p> " I knew him pretty well , " Procaccio said . " In dealing with Rashad , I 'd always known him as a kid with a huge heart . He had almost a simple innocence . He was very respectful  --  I do n't remember a foul word ever coming out of his mouth . " <p> Williams ' gesture toward Lance was simple , but it captivated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Francisco Examiner columnist Rob Morse wrote about Williams on May 11 , 1999 , six days before the Bay to Breakers . What followed was something that no one expected . <p> Williams appeared on " The Oprah Winfrey Show , " CNN , " Good Morning America , " MSNBC . He was a contestant on " To Tell the Truth . " He won many awards , including one from the National Alliance of Black Schools , and received a U.S. Senate Certificate of Commendation from Sen. Dianne Feinstein , D-Calif . <p> The teenager flew to Denver with his mother to deliver to Lance Kirklin and his family the money he had raised . Mayor Willie Brown declared May 24 , 1999 , Rashad Williams Day in the city and gave him and Lance a tour of the town . A year later , Williams was grand marshal of the Bay to Breakers . <p> People did n't forget what Williams had done . Even as a senior , he was still getting calls and flying around the country . It was n't all national TV  --  he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Society in Des Moines . <p> Despite the media bombardment , Williams remained " very humble , " his mother said . <p> " I did n't see a change  --  and I do n't think I 'm blind , " Procaccio said . " Before , he was very shy . He was still himself , but he had a little bit more confidence . " <p> Iranetta Davis-Myers , who used to teach Burton 's younger son , Rmard " R.J. " Harrison , recalled how Williams would pick up R.J. at school and lecture him about doing his homework . <p> " Rashad had a glow about him , " she said . " These ( street ) boys are hard . He was n't that way . "  --   --   --  <p> On the Friday morning of Dec. 16 , almost 500 people attended Williams ' funeral at Providence Baptist Church in the Bayview . <p> The corpse in the open casket wore a cream-colored suit . Williams ' hands were folded , and his face was serene , giving no hint of the two bullets that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " There were two gunshot wounds to the body , one being fatal , " police Sgt. Craig Clausen of Clearlake ( Lake County ) would testify on Jan. 11 in Lake County Superior Court . " The shots entered through the back . " <p> One was directly above the buttocks , exiting through the hip , Clausen said . Another penetrated Williams ' back shoulder . <p> Few in the crowd , which overflowed the 450-person capacity church , were aware of these forensic details . All they knew was that yet another product of the Bayview was dead  --  and that one of the neighborhood 's sweetest success stories had turned into an inexplicable horror . <p> Feinstein , Brown , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi , San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom and the city 's Board of Supervisors sent condolences . Williams ' uncle , Earl Smith , delivered the eulogy . <p> Smith told the mourners he had one question when he heard how his nephew had died . <p> " What happened ? " asked Smith , a chaplain at San Quentin State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't figure his nephew 's would be one of them . But he was convinced of one thing . <p> " What happened did n't need to happen , " he thundered . <p> When the lid of the casket closed and Sheila Burton said goodbye to her son , her wails filled the church . As she followed the coffin down the aisle  --  <p> four people holding her up  --  she screamed , " My baby , I 've lost my baby , " again and again .  --   --   --  <p> On Monday night , exactly one month after Rashad Williams was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Colma , Procaccio , his former track coach , was still trying to make sense of how his life had unraveled . <p> " This is a tough one for me , " said Procaccio , who left Riordan during Williams ' senior year for a job at San Jose State and is now headmaster at Stanbridge Academy in San Mateo . " There was no sense it would come to what it came to . " <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself up and searching for answers , " he said . " She went to the ends of the Earth for that kid . " <p> During a five-hour interview in her Brisbane home on Saturday afternoon , Burton spoke publicly for the first time about what had happened to her son . <p> Her 8-year-old boy was in bed with a fever , while her daughter , Remi Burton , almost 15 , was out and about . <p> " I love all three of my children , " said Burton , who is 42 . " But Rashad was the one who made me become an adult . " <p> When Rashad entered Burton 's life , she was 20 , living with her parents in the Bayview neighborhood where she had grown up . She said she and Rashad 's father , Tony Williams , split up when she was two months pregnant . The job of raising her firstborn would be left to her and her parents , Mack and Minnie Burton . <p> The boy was born on May 8 , 1984 , at Mount Zion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had big feet , " Burton recalled . " When he started to run track , I said , ' I see , Lord , why you 've blessed me with a child with big feet . ' " <p> They eventually moved to a nearby one-bedroom apartment that did n't have a bathtub . They moved elsewhere in the neighborhood , then Pacifica and South San Francisco , before settling into a rented Bayview house on Jamestown Avenue . <p> Rashad went to Visitacion Valley Preschool , Fellowship Academy and Riordan , an expensive private school , and began running for city track clubs when he was 7 . Burton worked two and three jobs at a time to pay for it all . At one point , she was driving school buses in Redwood City mornings and afternoons and racing back to a San Francisco beauty salon between shifts to manicure people 's nails . <p> Shortly before Williams became a media celebrity , Burton decided it was time to leave the Bayview . She bought a four-bedroom house in Antioch . <p> " It 's rough out there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ column . " I 'm trying to arm him with the best tools . " <p> In an Examiner story a month later , she said , " You raise your children as best you can , but when they become teens , you do n't know what 's going to happen . " <p> Her words , in retrospect , are haunting and prophetic .  --   --   --  <p> During her time in Antioch , Burton 's shift as an inspector at the San Francisco Municipal Railway , where she still works , started at 4:45 a.m . Williams would get his brother and sister fed and dressed , call a cab to take them from Antioch to the Pittsburg BART station , make sure they got to their schools in the city and then go off to his classes . <p> " Every day Rashad would do that , " Burton said . " My baby would never complain . He was forced to be a man at 15 . " <p> Procaccio said Williams became overwhelmed . <p> " I saw a boy trying to balance school , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I could n't have done it . " <p> By the time Williams was a senior at Riordan , he had quit track . The boy whose relay team had placed seventh in the country at the 1998 Junior Olympics in Seattle was just worn out . <p> Everything was converging . Burton said her marriage to Anthony Harrison , whom she 'd met in 1994 , had fallen apart , and Rashad deeply missed his stepfather . In late spring 2002 , Riordan officials told the family that Rashad was failing two classes  --  he could attend the graduation ceremony but he would not get his diploma . <p> " I know he was devastated , " Procaccio said . <p> And Williams was n't sure what he wanted to do with his life . He ended up working for Safeway and then for an online mortgage company . Although he loved dogs  --  he once had two pit bulls named Queenie and Prince  --  he abandoned his dream of being a veterinarian . <p> Burton said the graduation letdown was a turning point . Williams felt betrayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and the school did n't offer tutoring help to get a diploma that it would take him three more years to earn . <p> " His problems started that day at Riordan , and he was angry ever since , " Burton said . " Rashad turned into a child I did n't even recognize anymore . " <p> He 'd yell at his mother , which he 'd never done before , and started hanging out with " negative people , " she said . <p> In July 2004 , Burton sold her Antioch home , bought a new one in Brisbane and set up Williams in a Pittsburg apartment . <p> " I told him that I do n't take care of grown people , " Burton said . " But I did n't cut him off . " <p> In February 2005 , an unarmed Williams robbed two banks in Contra Costa County . He would have begun a three-year sentence this month in a Level 1 federal institution . <p> " The streets had won , " Burton said . " And , unfortunately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family persuaded Williams to move to Clearlake to stay with his grandparents , who had retired there . <p> " We felt that Clearlake would be the safest place for him , " Burton said .  --   --   --  <p> When Williams was shot to death , a boyhood pal was killed , too . Their best friend has been charged with their slayings , while the man who police say is responsible is still free . He contends that all three had invaded his home to steal drugs . <p> " I ca n't believe that the judicial system is treating it this way , " Burton said furiously . " Instead of my heart mending , it 's being torn apart . " <p> Even prosecutor Jon Hopkins feels sympathy for Burton and her parents . <p> " They put so much effort and so much energy , for so many years , into giving this kid a life , " said Hopkins , chief deputy district attorney in Lake County . <p> So why is Renato Hughes Jr . facing two counts of murder in the deaths of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school days at San Francisco 's Fellowship Academy ? <p> " We 're proceeding on a provocative-act murder theory , " Hopkins said . " If you do something that can provoke a lethal response , you 're liable for the crime partner 's death . " <p> Sheila Burton 's parents live a few blocks from Shannon Edmonds , the man whose house was allegedly invaded in what police say was an attempt to steal marijuana . Although the marijuana purportedly was being used for medical purposes , Sgt. Craig Clausen testified that the four 1-gallon bags seized by police appeared to be packaged as if they were for sale and were worth $1,000 to $5,000 apiece . A bucket of freshly picked marijuana also was found . <p> Police say Edmonds shot both men in the back  --  Williams twice and Foster five times . Their bodies were found on 11th Street , outside his house . Edmonds ' girlfriend said she was beaten up , along with her teenage son , who was in a coma and is now in a rehabilitation facility . <p> Burton and Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could imagine their sons going to the house to buy marijuana  --  a drug they both used  --  but do n't believe any home invasion occurred . <p> Last week , the mothers made the long drive to Clearlake for the first two days of a preliminary hearing that will determine whether Hughes will be tried for the killings . They 'll return today for what is likely to be the finale . <p> Burton last saw her son on Thanksgiving , when he came to her house for dinner . She said they sat on her bed and had their best talk in years . <p> On Dec. 6 , the day before he died , Williams phoned his mother and mentioned that he 'd just had some old tattoos removed . <p> However , he did acquire two new ones . <p> " The truth shall be my enlightenment , " one said . <p> And the other one said : " I 'm on the road to Zion .
