<p> Marais , a tony French-inspired restaurant reviewed in October , is a good example of the " right location , wrong concept " principle of opening restaurants . <p> It was open barely two months before it closed . In an attempt to recoup the investment , the money behind Marais brought in restaurant veteran Robert Hill . When he realized that remaking Marais was impossible , he masterminded the transformation to Dine . Same owners , same manager . New chef , new decor , even though big bucks had been spent to design the expansive space in the first place . Marais was so sedate you could hear yourself breathe . Noise was further dampened by drapes at the corners , cushy upholstered chairs and velvet-wrapped columns . Dine , however , is so exuberant you 'll find yourself shouting at your table mates . The new design features mostly hard surfaces , creating a din . <p> At Marais the food was refined , bordering on precious , with restrained use of salt and fat . Patrons felt as if they were dining at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ South of Market crowd came running . Dine 's chef , Julia McClaskey , creates lusty American combinations that make diners want to sigh as they push away from the table . <p> The success of Dine shows how important it is for a restaurant to mirror its location , even if the place is designed to attract a crowd from all over the Bay Area . If designers and chefs are n't sensitive to these environmental aspects , they might as well be opening a theme restaurant in a shopping mall . <p> WHITE-HOT AREA <p> Located on Mission near Second Street , Dine is at the epicenter of the white-hot SOMA district that includes Yerba Buena Gardens , Moscone Center and the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art . This area simply does n't attract the normal Financial District crowd that might have been interested in Marais . <p> Dine is edgy , but in a relaxed , comfortable sort of way . Designer Michael Brennan jettisoned the velvet-cushioned support columns down the middle of the room and covered them in slate tiles . He removed the planter boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also uncovered the red-brick walls and removed the posh high-back upholstered chairs in favor of sleek polished-wood designs . <p> Instead of a traditional chandelier , there 's a whimsical incarnation : a double layer of exposed bulbs orbiting an illuminated globe of the world . It 's centered over a rustic communal table that seats 12 , set with a casual arrangement of lilacs and two rusty metal candelabras that produce a soft , warming glow . <p> The soul of the restaurant , however , is McClaskey , who was named one of The Chronicle 's " Rising Stars " in 1997 when she was cooking her lusty combinations at Universal Cafe , another trendy restaurant located in the Multimedia Gulch area . At Dine , the talented chef has found an expanded audience for her homey preparations . <p> She brought along her famous pot roast ( $18 ) , probably one of the best examples of American home cooking one will ever eat in a restaurant . The dish consists of two thick slices of beef over a mound of fluffy mashed potatoes . The bottom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flavored broth strewn with a stew of vegetables including mushrooms , carrots , parsnips and baby turnips . <p> McClaskey also wraps pork tenderloin ( $21 ) in pancetta and serves the whole tenderloin , sliced into thick coins , over creamy polenta and Swiss chard . The elements are united with a port sauce balanced with the tang of whole-grain mustard . It 's an exciting yet familiar combination . <p> She also creates one of the best preparations of chicken ( $19 ) : The small bird is stuffed with a Parmesan-flavored orzo and set on a bed of sauteed pea shoots flavored with pan juices . <p> Even her fish dishes come across as substantial , bordering on heavy . Sauteed skate ( $20 ) tops a heaping bowl of bright green watercress risotto , all drizzled with a hazelnut brown butter . Unfortunately , the butter collects at the rim , making the dish look unappetizingly greasy . <p> A flaky hunk of Chilean sea bass ( $22 ) is crusted in hazelnuts and served with caramelized fennel , roasted onions , fingerling potatoes and a light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at times the portions border on excessive and the plates cross the line from generous to sloppy . <p> Appetizers can be pretty substantial , too , particularly the huge meaty braised short ribs ( $10 ) glistening in a chipotle glaze and served with a hefty mountain of cabbage slaw with red and yellow peppers , purple onions and puckery squirts of lime . <p> One of the most distinctive ways to begin is with the crisp-seared scallops ( $11 ) served with a lemon tarragon aioli , asparagus and a black radish salad . The amazing play of flavors , textures and temperatures makes this dish a standout . Another brilliant combination : a warm escarole salad ( $8 ) with thick slices of Sierra Beauty apples and crumbles of Gorgonzola for contrast . <p> I love the chef 's deft touch with chicken livers ( $8 )  --  they 're crisp and salty outside and spreadably creamy inside . They 're enhanced with applewood bacon and presented on organic greens with sweet bursts of dried cranberries . <p> For lighter fare , McClaskey has created a fava bean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pecorino cheese ( $9 ) . It 's a seasonally fresh , exciting combination . <p> HOMEY DESSERTS <p> Desserts ( all $7 ) are just as homey : a smooth , rich butterscotch pot de creme with a mound of whipped cream on top ; cooling coffee ice cream-stuffed profiteroles drizzled with chocolate ; a bitter-edged chocolate pudding cake that 's smoothed with mild pistachio ice cream ; and a wonderful tarte tatin with vanilla bean ice cream . <p> The service is far from down-home . The management team is filled with veterans , and the core of the staff has come from some of the best restaurants . Staff members have clearly been given instructions on food , wine and the basics of service . <p> The waiters , wearing starched green shirts and dark green ties , look professional and ready to perform . Their manner is relaxed and confident , a combination that 's becoming rare with the continual opening of high-profile restaurants . <p> A successful restaurant is all about good food , a convivial atmosphere and giving people what they want , where they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> BOLD WINES MATCH THE FOOD <p> The most exciting wine lists are those that capture the essence of the food served at a restaurant . Dine is a good example of this synergy of wine and food . Chef Julia McClaskey produces bold , rich American combinations , and the wine list is filled with rich-textured , bold wines . The 60-item list covers several continents , with wines from France , Italy , the United States and Australia . They all share a compatible style . <p> Prices are excellent , with many selections marked up barely twice wholesale . <p> One downside , found at so many restaurants these days : The red wines are improperly stored and served too warm . Be prepared to ask for an ice bucket to bring the wine to cellar temperature . In addition , the list is plagued with a few misspellings and typographical errors . <p> The white wines run the gamut from the 1999 Thornbury Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand ( $24 ) to the 1998 McDowell Marsanne ( $21 ) and the ever popular 1997 Bouchard 8 Far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive California white on the list . <p> In reds , excellent choices are the 1997 Gundlach Bundschu " Rhinefarm Vineyards " Merlot ( $25 ) and both of the Yarra Yering wines from Australia , the 1992 Shiraz ( $60 ) and the 1993 Pinot Noir ( $85 ) . If you 're looking for a less expensive Pinot Noir , you 'll be pleased with the 1997 Joseph Swan Russian River ( $32 ) . <p> If you want to bring your own wine , the corkage fee is $15 . <p> The list also includes 12 interesting wines by the glass and a hefty list of 13 dessert wines , including port , sherry and Madeira .
