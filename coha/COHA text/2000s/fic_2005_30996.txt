Chapter One now My mom says that I did n't sleep through the night until I was eight years old . It did n't make any difference to her ' cause she was up too , listening to the city . She says she used to come into my room , sit cross-legged on the floor by my bed , and play with my Game Boy in the dark . We never talked . I guess I thought she needed to be there . And she must have thought her being there made everything all better for me . Yeah . I get it now . I really get it . We did n't need to say it . We did n't have to look at each other or even let the other one know we saw each other in the glow of the Game Boy . So last week when it looked like Feather probably was n't ever going to sleep through the night , I lay her on my stomach and breathed her in . My daughter is eleven days old . And that sweet new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my mom 's perfume . It made me cry like I had n't since I was a little kid . It scared the hell out of me . Then , when Feather moved on my stomach like one of those mechanical dolls in the store windows at Christmas , the tears dried up . Like that . I thought about laying her in the middle of my bed and going off to find my old Game Boy , but I did n't . Things have to change . I 've been thinking about it . Everything . And when Feather opens her eyes and looks up at me , I already know there 's change . But I figure if the world were really right , humans would live life backward and do the first part last . They 'd be all knowing in the beginning and innocent in the end . Then everybody could end their life on their momma or daddy 's stomach in a warm room , waiting for the soft morning light . then And this is how I turned sixteen .... Skipped school with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Mineo 's for a couple of slices . Hit a matinee and threw as much popcorn at each other as we ate . Then went to the top of the Empire State Building ' cause I never had before . I said what everybody who 'd ever been up there says . " Everybody looks like ants . " Yeah , right .... Later on that night my pops , Fred , made my favorite meal - cheese fries and ribs - at his restaurant . I caught the subway home and walked real slow ' cause I knew my mom had a big-ass cake for me when I got there , and I was still full . ( In my family , special days mean nonstop food . ) I never had any cake though ' cause my girlfriend Nia was waiting on our stoop for me with a red balloon . Just sittin ' there with a balloon , looking all lost . I 'll never forget that look and how her voice shook when she said , " Bobby , I 've got something to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Continues ... )
