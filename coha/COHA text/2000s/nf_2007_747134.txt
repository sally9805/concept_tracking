INTRODUCTION <p> Modern official Czech drug policies were initiated in 1993 when the government approved its first national drug policy program for 1993 to 1996 . The current policy was defined in the National Drug Policy Strategy 2005-2009 , a document that calls for an evidence-based drug policy and a balanced and interdisciplinary approach to the problem of drug use . In order to assess the existence of possible discrepancies between these official statements and their practical implementation , the author provides an analysis of Czech drug policy based on a review of official and other documents as well as interviews with representatives and key players in the Czech drug policy arena . The main finding is that several conflicts exist between the official policy and its practical application and that these disparities serve as obstacles to its effectiveness . These differences exist because of the wide variety of ways in which key players have conceptualized drug use per se and the manner in which they have constructed particular reform measures to implement and mirror their main interests and priorities . Particular areas of concern that have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In order to assure the effectiveness of future Czech drug policy , further research , especially regarding its practical application , needs to occur . <p> The modern official Czech drug policy began in 1993 when the government , reacting to an appeal by NGOs , ( n1 ) established the National Drug Commission as its interdepartmental advisory body and approved its first national program of drug policy for 1993 to 1996 . The more recent policy has been defined in a government document , the National Drug Policy Strategy 2005-2009 ( this document serves as the fourth iteration of the national drug policy since 1993 ) . It emphasizes the need for prevention , treatment , rehabilitation , risk minimization , ( n2 ) law enforcement , agency coordination , funding , and international cooperation ( see Figure 1 ) . During the most recent policy formulation sessions , more than 70 representatives of various state administrative institutions , researchers at the central and regional levels , and practitioners and service providers participated in the deliberations . The latest strategy defines basic starting points , principles , targets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approach " ( National Drug Commission , 2005 , p. 14 ) . One of the strategy 's guiding principles is that it stresses the need for an emphasis to be placed on evidence-based policy . As will be illustrated below , however , the implementation of this ideal has been far from perfect . <p> This research was designed to address several crucial concerns . First , there is sparse research on drug policy making in Central Europe ( Fountain , Griffiths , &; Hartnoll , 2000 ) , and this is particularly true in the Czech Republic . Second , there is little literature addressing methodological issues as they relate to drug policy research generally ( Fountain et al. , 2000 ) . Third , one extremely important but relatively hidden population in the drug research field consists of the policy makers themselves and the representatives of various interest groups who influence them ( Berridge , 2000 ) . Fourth , the theory of changes suggests that key institutions and individuals play important roles in the implementation or obstruction of new policy measures ( Weiss , 1986 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context of the evolution of modern drug policy in the Czech Republic . This approach should prove useful by providing an understanding of the processes that have influenced the key players in the Czech drug arena and the formulation and implementation of domestic drug policy . <p> As noted above , little available research exists on drug policy making and government responses to drug use problems . Georges Estievenart ( European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction EMCDDA , 2000 ) has suggested the following reasons to explain the absence of such drug policy evaluation : <p> ( 1 ) a lack of interest in evaluation due to the difficulties in evaluating ill-defined objectives <p> ( 2 ) possible fears of those responsible for drug policy implementation in regard to the potential consequences of negative evaluation <p> ( 3 ) a lack of expert skills for conducting program evaluations <p> ( 4 ) a lack of financial and human resources with which to carry out such investigations . <p> Estievenart 's summary of these critical factors is supported elsewhere in the scientific literature , with various authors documenting the existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MacGregor , 1999 ; Stimson , 1995 ) and of tensions and discrepancies associated with international , national , and local policies ( Wardlaw , 1992 ; Hartnoll , 2000 ) . These disjunctions are highlighted whenever assessments are made of the rhetoric of drug strategies in light of the actual budget amounts allocated for law enforcement , prevention , and treatment interventions ( Carnevale &; Murphy , 1999 ) . Some institutions have focused their evaluations solely on program descriptions rather than committing to an assessment of program impact ( Fazey , 2003 ) . It has been repeatedly demonstrated that the evaluation strategies which have been used to assess outcomes have not been equitably applied to all such efforts . For example , the most closely evaluated programs involve treatment and harm reduction efforts , while the least evaluated have been those associated with law enforcement  --  paradoxically the most expensive and least cost effective strategy ( Wardlaw , 1992 ; Stimson , 1994 ; Mishan , 1994 ; Ossebaard &; van de Wijngaart , 1998 ; Bullington , 2000 ; Gossop , 2000 ; Szasz , 2000 ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evaluation of prevention efforts fall somewhere in between these two extremes . Despite the lack of supporting research , prevention seems to be both well funded and widely supported , thanks to its popularity among the general public and politicians who have sponsored numerous programs to protect children against drugs ( Reuter , 2001 ) . We should note too that the vast majority of the extant scientific literature features quantitative/statistical or monetary based analyses of drug policies in terms of measurements of their outcomes or impacts . <p> The objective of this research is to provide an analysis of Czech drug policy as it is currently being applied . Given the frequent claims that the policy is now evidence based , the author completed a review of the published scientific literature with the aim of identifying existing models for conducting drug policy analyses . This review revealed that an increasing number of researchers are paying attention to drug policy analysis and that most of these experts agree that one means of comprehending the so-called " drug problem " is to understand the way in which different societies conceptualize and respond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how drug problems are conceptualized , that is , defined , discussed , and presented . One basic approach to drug policy analysis is found in Stimson ( 1990 ) , who suggests we should " analyse assumptions about the nature of ( a ) the problem , ( b ) the drug users , ( c ) the task facing policy makers and practitioners , and their assumptions about ( d ) the appropriate experts to deal with the problem and ( e ) their relationship with drug users and finally , ( f ) relationship of all participants  --  i.e. , drug users , professionals , police , government " ( p. 329 ) . METHODOLOGY <p> This research was conducted utilizing a qualitative approach and grounded theory ( Glaser &; Strauss , 1967 ; Strauss &; Corbin , 1990 ) . There were several reasons for the adoption of these strategies . The qualitative approach is thought to be the method most likely to foster a deep understanding of the positions articulated by persons who often disagree with one another ( Bryman , 2001 ) , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which drug policy is actually constructed . According to Taylor ( 1993 ) , in order to understand social actions we must grasp the meaning that actors attach to their actions . Grounded theory differs from other qualitative approaches through its use of iterative comparative analysis and theoretical sampling ( Strauss &; Corbin , 1998 ; Bryman , 2001 ) , which allow for a high level of flexibility in data collection and analysis ( Glasser &; Strauss , 1967 ) . <p> Four main sources of data were collected . First , the author surveyed all published scientific literature ( in both the English and Czech languages ) , reviewing all accessible sources with the use of the key words " drug policy analysis . " Second , all published official and semi-official literature on Czech drug policy since its advent in 1993 has been used as primary or complementary data . A third data source consisted of face-to-face semi-structured interviews with some of the key stakeholders in the Czech drug policy field . These interviews were supplemented by information provided by one focus group and through electronic correspondence with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth data source consists of the author 's personal observations and written memoranda pertaining to various national and international events , such as formal and informal meetings , working groups , conferences , and projects . ( Beginning in 1993 , the author became involved in drug policy development at the local level , and from 1998 to 2004 he worked at the national level as a national drug policy coordinator in the EU  --  the position of " drug czar " in American drug policy jargon . ) <p> The author 's direct participation in the processes being investigated poses various risks , particularly that of bias due to one 's perspective and personal values . To minimize this concern , as well as other potential sources of bias , triangulation of the wide range of data sources was used . DEVELOPMENT AND CURRENT SITUATION IN THE CZECH DRUG FIELD <p> Significant political , economic , social , and cultural changes began in Czech society immediately after the 1989 Velvet Revolution , with its overthrow of the long-standing communist government . This period of transition from a totalitarian to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had previously been suppressed by the communist regime . Critical among these were crime , mental illness , child abuse , and the use of illicit substances . As experts and the media began to make these phenomena highly transparent , their actions provoked calls to begin dealing with these issues in a more systematic way . In response to these public demands , in 1993 the Czech government established its first national drug policy. ( n3 ) Since then , the drug control system has evolved considerably , inspired to a certain extent by models that exist in some Western European countries , although domestic concerns and methods have always predominated in these discussions . <p> Under the control of the communist regime , nonconformists such as drug users were treated as public enemies of the so-called " ideal classless society " and were persecuted . At that time , illicit drugs were being prepared and distributed within small closed groups of users . Home grown marijuana , solvents , " pervitin " ( a homemade form of methamphetamine ) and " brown " ( hydrocodone ) were the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with methamphetamine and heroin respectively in terms of their pharmacological effects . The compulsory treatment of drug users was conducted by " anti-alcoholic and anti-toxic mania " units of psychiatric out- or in-patient clinics . In 1985 , these clinics had registered 6,982 " persons with addiction.and abusing drugs without addiction " ( Kalina , 1993 , p. 7 ) . These estimates must be viewed with considerable caution , however , as one local expert has estimated that the number of drug addicts in the 1980s was between 25,000 and 30,000 ( Nozina , 1997 ) . Thus , we should remain aware of the fact that drugs were also used under the earlier communist regime , although this was not typically known by the public because the government treated any discussion of the topic as taboo . Consequently , the public never developed any informed understanding regarding appropriate mechanisms for conceptualizing drug use , much less of the appropriate means by which to monitor , analyze , and respond to it . This navet was mirrored in the act(n4) adopted in 1989 , legislation which was effectively nullified immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n5 ) Despite its irrelevance , that legislation remained in force until 2005 . <p> Contrary to various media portrayals , sensationalized reports that have impacted public and political opinions , the situation with regard to rates of drug use has not changed significantly since the change in political regimes at the end of 1989 . The number of problem drug users in the Czech Republic has remained relatively stable over the long term ( EMCDDA , 2003 ) . Police and customs have succeeded in seizing relatively insignificant amounts ( less than 1% of all drugs estimated to have been consumed illegally in 2003 ) , a fact that is reflected in the fall of street prices of drugs and increases in their availability . Some positive shifts in drug experimentation have been documented since 1998 as well , with users seeking out less risky drugs , such as marijuana and ecstasy . However , injection drug use still presents serious public health risks , including the possible transmission of bloodborne viruses . <p> Despite the recent tightening of drug legislation in 1999 ( introducing potential punishments for drug possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ criminal justice system than are being handled through the system of social and health services . Specifically , all drug offenses prosecuted numbered 2,357 in 2003 , 232 of which were for drug possession alone . In contrast , 18,000 persons were treated in 2003 , and these treatment participants accounted for about 60% of all problem drug users . In spite of the unequal caseloads handled by the criminal justice and health care systems , the proportion of expenditures of public funds on drug policy is skewed toward the criminal justice system , which receives most of the available money , and treatment the least , at a ratio of 82:13 ( Zabransky , Miovsky , Mravcik , &; Gajdosikova , 2001 ) . PROCESSES OF DRUG POLICY MAKING IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC <p> ENVIRONMENT AND TYPES OF INFLUENCE IN DRUG POLICY MAKING <p> Drug policy is often defined as a social product ( Berridge , 1998 ) , and as such it is not developed in a vacuum . Policy arises from a permanent and ongoing interplay between three broader types of influence : ( 1 ) external ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from the European Union towards candidate and/or member states in relation to drug policies ) , ( 2 ) local drug nonspecific matters ( broader historical , cultural , social and/or political contexts of a particular country and/or region ) , and ( 3 ) local drug specific matters ( e.g. , perception of drug use and of drug users , trends in drug use , and problems related to it ) . These factors and their relative significance and influence in regard to the actual construction of drug policy are constantly changing over time . One crucial factor in this process seems to be the way in which the key players involved in policy making conceptualize drugs and drug use and their relative influence in drug policy formulation and its implementation . <p> As discussed above , drug policy is always a product of a particular society 's unique array of values , assumptions , and expectations . These apply directly to a variety of drug specific as well as nonspecific social issues . Societal attitudes appear to be strongly determined by the broader cultural , historical , political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Subsequent to the development of the constitution of the Czechoslovak Republic in 1918 , Czech society has experienced at least three distinct types of political regimes : democratic ( 1918 to 1938 , 1989 to present ) , fascist ( 1939 to 1945 ) , and communist ( 1948 to 1989 ) . The latter two fostered a very long " trial " to build up an " ideal classless " society ( one without typical problems such as crime , drug use , child abuse , and illnesses attributable to class distinctions ) . Both contributed significantly to a breakdown of the initially democratic development of the country , causing a great deal of damage . This is revealed even today , more than 15 years after the dramatic change in political regimes , in the Czech Republic 's adverse " heritage of communism . " To gain an understanding of the relevant societal factors that influence and shape any development in drug policy , it is necessary to identify and interpret those covert variables that may underly and subtly influence the official decision making process . An account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy making ( and very likely not an exhaustive one ) certainly must include this heritage of communism . <p> We have noted that a major problem with Czech drug policy is the conflict that exists between the rhetoric of the established ideal and the practical reality associated with the interplay among the three types of influence described above . In the process of policy making , the discrepancy between official statements and their implementation presents serious obstacles to drug policy effectiveness . The most important conflicts that have led to this disjointed state may be identified as follows : <p> ( 1 ) the various and often contradictory interests of key players ( e.g. , whereas public health professionals primarily aim to reduce potential health risks related to drug use , the police are especially concerned with drug-related crime and thus support punishment instead of treatment of users ) <p> ( 2 ) the conflict that exists between declared philosophical principles and defined aims ( the drug policy is said to be evidence based and its aims attainable , but the policy document remains vague and incorporates unachievable aims  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the period of four years ) <p> ( 3 ) achieving some balance in the application of drug supply and demand reduction measures ( whereas a balanced policy in relation to prevention , risk reduction , treatment , and law enforcement is declared , in practice priority might be given to law enforcement and thus to the prosecution of drug users ) <p> ( 4 ) establishing controls for both illicit and licit drugs ( whereas the policy calls for strict controls in relation to illicit drugs , licit substances are seldom even perceived as drugs , and their use is thereby trivialized ) <p> ( 5 ) politicization ( the generation of arguments between drug abuse experts and politicians where the latter might ignore evidence-based recommendations by professionals ) <p> ( 6 ) a government 's attitude towards statutory and nonstatutory sectors ( whereas equal opportunity for both governmental as well as nongovernmental service providers is supported in the legislation , this ideal is not achieved in practice  --  e.g. , in the funding of drug services , the latter are disadvantaged ) <p> ( 7 ) practice and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from treatment services has urged the government to relax the punishment regarding possession of cannabis for personal use , the police have lobbied to tighten it ) . <p> One might inquire as to the nature of the specific threats posed by these conflicts in relation to drug policy . These disparities contribute to the confusion of politicians , civil servants , the professional community , and the public . These quandaries may in turn lead to an increase in the popularity of populist solutions and their adoption , thereby widening the gap between rhetoric and practice . <p> As an illustration , when an unattainable and vague aim is formulated for primary prevention efforts , such as a decrease in the number of drug users , this proves to be dysfunctional in the long run as it is unachievable . This apparent failure may then lead to a call by some populist politicians for a tightening of drug controls through the introduction of harsher punishments for both drug dealers and users in order to more effectively deter young people from further use . Despite the fact that there is no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and decision makers who are confused by the apparent ineffectiveness of drug education efforts might support such a measure . Of course it is very likely that this repressive change in drug policy will also fail to achieve the initial goal  --  a reduction in the number of drug users . Given these observations , in order to develop and implement a more realistic and effective drug policy , there must first be a convergence between rhetoric and practice , which can only be accomplished by a parsimonious utilization of accessible evidence . This important objective poses a real challenge for experts involved in drug policy formulation and implementation , regardless of whether they are researchers , practitioners , and/or civil servants . <p> STRUCTURE OF DRUG POLICY MAKING IN THE CZECH REPUBLIC <p> Since 1993 , the main responsibility for the development and coordination of Czech drug policy has been borne by the National Drug Commission ( NDC ) . The commission is composed of nine members of the cabinet . The prime minister serves as its chairman . The minister of social affairs acts as its executive vice chairman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsible for drug policy . Ministers of the interior , justice , defence , health , education , foreign affairs , and finance comprise the remaining commission members . The NDC usually meets four times a year , and its responsibilities are operationalized by its secretariat . It is responsible for communication with ( and among ) ministries , units of public administration , and governmental as well as nongovernmental organizations . It develops proposals and discussion papers for the NDC , ( n6 ) collects and analyzes data on drug issues , ( n7 ) and coordinates activities at the international , national , and local levels . Cooperation and communication at the national level is ensured in the committee of departmental representatives(n8) and between the national and local levels by the working group of regional drug policy coordinators. ( n9 ) Both groups are led by the head of the secretariat . The structure of the policy making apparatus and its implementation in the Czech Republic is illustrated in Figure 2 . <p> FACTORS AFFECTING THE PROCESSES OF DRUG POLICY MAKING CONCEPTUALIZATION OF DRUG USE AND CONFLICTS BETWEEN KEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an interdepartmental or cross-pillar issue . This is reflected in policy documents that stress the need for a multidisciplinary , integrated , and coordinated approach involving a wide variety of key players ( National Drug Commission , 2005 ) . But as already mentioned , their efforts at developing a consensual approach might be undermined by the way in which they individually conceptualize drugs and drug use ( Stimson , 1990 ; MacGregor , 2000 ) and by their personal influence in the policy formulation and implementation process . Some concepts may be logically defined in terms of the main mission of a particular key player . For example , the departments of justice and/or interior perceive drug use per se to be a crime because " it is closely related to the offense of drug possession and to other crimes " ( focus group ) . Historically , these two groups have identified various behaviors as being either good or evil . However , in other instances there may be no predicting a particular official 's position , such as in the following statement made by a health official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem . We have to treat a drug user in any circumstance despite this being the fault of a particular person .. We . to deal with it even if we do n't want to .. ( Interview No. 1 ) <p> This intolerant position mirrors the opinion of the majority of the general public but seems unusual for a professional health care provider . It is also clear that perceptions of drug users differ significantly between a group of civil servants who are responsible for addressing drug policy issues but rarely have any direct contact with users and a second group comprised of representatives of drug services who maintain daily contacts with users . Illustrations of the latter position are provided below : <p> . drug addiction is demonized .. There is a little knowledge about it .. When you meet them drug users , you 'll find out that they are entirely normal people with some problems . ( Interview No. 3 ) <p> They drug users appear to be " normal " . just a bit sensitive people with a lack of skills to cope with problems .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the perceptions of the problem of drugs differ markedly among the key Czech players involved in drug policy formulation and implementation . The different interests and priorities associated with various definitions of the problems associated with drugs were also reflected in personal interviews : <p> . the interdepartmental communication . stagnates . because everyone gives the priority to something else . ( Interview No. 1 ) <p> Everyone just wants something else . There is no common , coordinated policy .. ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> Within the Czech Republic , the NDC and its secretariat are supposed to play a key role in the formulation and delivery of drug policy . In practice , however , certain critical areas remain within the control of other relevant departments(n10) ( National Drug Commission , 2005 ) . Thus , the NDC itself remains an advisory body , without executive functions . There appears to be an array of disadvantages associated with this system in practice . First , for some of the various departments involved , drug policy represents only a minor part of their work agenda and therefore they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <p> . there is nobody in the Department of Health . engaged in drugs .. Formally there is one you can never catch .. The whole area is underestimated by the department but also by the government . ( Interview No. 2 ) <p> The most important finding is the lack of workers appointed to solve problems of drug policy .. in Departments of Education , Social Affairs , Health and Justice . ( National Drug Commission , 2003 , p. 14 ) <p> Second , different attitudes and interests may lead to mutual rivalries ( Rhodes e al. , 1999 ) : <p> . policemen warn of the danger connected with a liberal drug policy which . attempts to bring a group of experts . from the . therapeutic centres . These individuals . mask an increasing drug problem and claim that it is necessary to solve the problem of drugs as a health problem . ( Komorous , 2003 , p. 1 ) <p> Third , the NDC has no effective methods for assuring that drug policy directive are followed : <p> There are tasks . in drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . possible that they do not fulfill them and nothing happens ? ( Interview No. 4 ) <p> Fourth , one typical survivor of the communist regime is the mutual distrust and rivalry that exists between various professions , ( n11 ) fields , or statutory and nonstatutory sectors ( Burrows , Trautmann , Bijil , &; Sarankov , 1999 ) : <p> There is still a kind of rivalry and distrust between us ( NGOs ) and some doctors . ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> Fifth , during all phases(n12) of the emerging Czech drug policy , diligent efforts were made by detractors to dissolve the secretariat of the NDC or to replace its chairman . The results of these actions are described below : <p> . we do strongly feel disruption of the NDC , which has a negative influence not only on our . international contacts but it also . results in ineffective funding .. ( Polanecky , 1997 , p. 12 ) <p> . after the change of the head of NDC Secretariate it seems that the Czech drug policy sleeps .. ( Holub @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conflicts ( and many others ) involving both individuals and institutions have effectively created barriers to the realization of the concept of meaningful multi-agency cooperation , and , thus , to the provision of a more realistic and effective drug policy . The achievement of its defined goals  --  to minimize potential adverse consequences of drug use to individuals as well as to society  --  have been thwarted by the ongoing dissension among the interested parties . <p> AIMS OF DRUG POLICY VERSUS PHILOSOPHICAL PRINCIPLES <p> Formulation of drug policy aims may be influenced by various beliefs , interests , and priorities of key players participating in the policy 's design and implementation . While one can quite easily find agreement concerning basic philosophical principles  --  often repeated in various official documents as an empty mantra  --  an understanding of the specific meaning of these terms by the various stakeholders differs significantly ( Hartnoll , 2004 ) . Thus , serious difficulties are evidenced whenever an attempt is made to find a consensus in defining specific achievable and measurable objectives and aims . The consequences of this conundrum are that compromises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nonmeasurable politically driven aims . <p> The police representative insisted on the adoption of a " drug-free society " as an ultimate objective within the preparation of the National Strategy 2001-2004 . He stated that he was aware that it would be an unattainable goal but he perceived every other goal as an approval of drug use . ( Radimecky , personal notes , 2001 ) <p> Both textual analysis and interview responses suggest that the Czech drug policy documents contain vague , unattainable , and/or nonmeasurable aims that proclaim emphasis on a realistic , evidence-based approach . ( It is important to note , however , that this criticism does not apply to all of the specific aims identified in the most recent strategy prepared for the period 2005-2009 see Figure 4 ) . The vagueness of drug policy objectives is illustrated by the five-year goal related to law enforcement . This goal was added during interdepartmental negotiations regarding the final text of the strategy document . The general goal " to reduce the use of all types of drugs and/or potential adverse consequences related to drug use " ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopted due to pressure from the ministry of the interior . Given the often noncritical approach taken towards drug supply intervention measures  --  a common characteristic of most drug policies around the world  --  it is probably not surprising that the Czech document only calls for standard law enforcement agency efforts and does not establish any expected measurable outcomes . <p> Thus , Czech drug policy is primarily concerned with drug use reduction , although these aims are defined rather vaguely with phrasing such as " to reduce drug use/increase an awareness concerning drug-related risks " and " to halt the rising of illicit drug use . " In some general categories  --  such as the number of problem or experimental drug users and the quantities of drugs , alcohol , and tobacco that are consumed  --  reliable figures are already available . This means that a clear baseline has been established for more advanced research assessments . <p> However , this same level of knowledge does not exist in other areas , such as risks related to drug use , quality of life , and the availability of licit as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult to measure , even in the former cases where measurable aims are established and baseline data is available . The strategy does not say by how much a substance 's use should be reduced , increased , or stopped , nor does it establish a time flame for accomplishing these goals . At this point it is important to mention that it is always difficult to attribute any measured change in patterns of drug use to a particular drug policy ( Hartnoll , 2004 ) . Thus , even when there are discernable increases or decreases in use , we can not know for sure whether those may be attributable to policy initiatives or to some other factors . <p> Typically , those most critical of the formulation of ill defined and/or vague aims within drug policy strategy in the Czech Republic were representatives of drug services and drug researchers . On the other hand , those least critical of these ambiguities were civil servants . <p> The aims appear to be not only unachievable but also vaguely formulated , the terminology and its meaning is unclear . ( Interview @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impact of any primary prevention activity . There are no clear performance criteria .. ( Focus Group ) <p> Given the context of current trends suggesting there has been a steady increase in experimental and recreational drug use ( EMCDDA , 2003 ) , the articulated aims of reducing drug use seem nave : <p> I think that everybody in the government knows that the aims are not achievable . But they do n't care . ( Interview No.5 ) <p> Various attempts to reduce the availability of drugs , so-called supply-side strategies , may be similarly misguided and unrealistic . A more practical but still vague proposal establishes the aim of reducing potential risks of all types of drugs and their impacts on individuals and society as a whole . It is worth noting that this strategy of harm reduction was never mentioned in the previous policy documents , despite the fact that harm minimization has been one of the four basic pillars of the official Czech drug policy since 2001 ( National Drug Commission , 2000 ) . The inclusion of this strategy in the latest policy suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makers may be under way , although it has taken considerable time and effort to overcome entrenched stereotypes that characterize harm reduction methods as tacitly approving of drug use . <p> A BALANCED APPROACH <p> As stated in the United Nation 's Declaration on the Guiding Principles of Drug Demand Reduction ( United Nations General Assembly , 1998 ) , the balanced approach is considered to be an effective strategy in the drug policy of the Czech Republic ( National Drug Commission , 2005 ) and in other nations . Still , the phrase " balanced approach " remains ill defined , and an analysis of the current Czech drug policy supports the notion that there is a considerable discrepancy between the rhetoric of a balanced policy and its practice . In this study , most interviewees acknowledged that there was considerable inequity in the amount of funds dedicated to various components of the drug policy : <p> There is enough evidence about a clear imbalance in funding between repression and treatment . ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> There is a clear disproportionality in funds allocated to law enforcement and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also apparent in the application of various strategies : <p> There is clear imbalance between the application of prevention and repression .. ( Focus Group ) <p> One way to empirically test the rhetoric about a balanced approach between different strategies aimed at reducing drug supply and demand reduction would be to conduct an analysis of the proportion of available funds allocated to each of these concerns . Such an analysis faces difficulties in the identification of the amounts actually provided to the criminal justice system , however . The issue is that law enforcement agencies , courts , and/or prisons rarely record expenses for the portion of their overall activities that relate to the prosecution and punishment of drug traffickers , distributors , and/or users as opposed to other groups of offenders ( Wardlaw , 1992 ) . In contrast , the funds for prevention and treatment are quite often specifically delineated for those purposes alone . While implementing its 1988 drug policy , the Czech society spent CZK 2.3 billion in direct costs , 82% of which ( CZK 1.886 billion ) was spent on the criminal justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ treatment and rehabilitation of drug users , 3% ( CZK 69 million ) on prevention , 1% on transactions costs ( CZK 23 million ) , and 1% ( CZK 23 million ) on the families of drug users ( Zabransky et al. , 2001 ) . Given these commitments , it seems foolhardy to speak of a balanced approach , as most drug policy funds are now channeled to the justice system to fund the different elements of repression activities . <p> If one were to conduct such an analysis , it would be especially interesting to look at the relative effectiveness of law enforcement as opposed to treatment services . This hypothetical comparison could be constructed by establishing a " capture " figure. ( n13 ) For example , in 2003 police and customs captured less than 1% of all persons who consumed illicit drugs in that year ; in contrast , risk minimization programs captured about 80% of problem drug users , 21% of whom passed through some form of treatment ( i.e. , abstinence-oriented or substitution treatment ) programs ( Zabransky et al. , 2001 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unambiguously supports risk minimization and treatment over repression . The practical degree of influence that is arbitrarily wielded by the NDC in the drug policy is reflected in the funds that it managed . Altogether in 2003 , the NDC managed CZK 105 million , less than 5% of all direct costs associated with the national drug policy . <p> ILLICIT VERSUS LICIT DRUGS <p> The scientific literature strongly suggests that a major step toward the development of a sound drug policy mandates the inclusion of alcohol and tobacco as real drugs in the same sense as illicit drugs . This would ensure that all drugs are given proper emphasis in policy making related to both health care concerns and drug control ( Reuter &; Caulkins , 1995 ) . For the first time in the history of Czech drug policy , the National Drug Policy Strategy 2005-2009 included alcohol and tobacco among named drugs and committed itself to tackling problems related to the use of these socially accepted drugs in the same manner that they deal with problems related to the use of illegal drugs . Future developments will reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For the time being , however , expert opinions on this topic differ significantly , and this is true of practitioners as well as of researchers and politicians . The practitioners are convinced that : <p> The biggest problem . in drug policy is the division between illicit and licit drugs not reflecting the evidence . ( Interview No. 2 ) <p> . it is important to solve all dependencies .. much worse than illicit drugs are problems around solvent use .. In my opinion it drug policy is about all types of dependence .. ( Interview No. 1 ) <p> . alcohol and tobacco use must form an inseparable block with illicit substances .. ( Interview No. 4 ) <p> The politicians , however , think differently : <p> Concerns about damages caused by the use of alcohol and tobacco as expressed by certain so-called experts in the dependence field only result from their intention to divert public attention from serious health , social , and safety problems caused by the use of illegal drugs . ( minister of the interior , personal notes , 2004 ) <p> Marijuana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one can move to the use of more dangerous drugs like heroin . From the use of gin one can move only to whisky . ( Kalousek , 2005 , transcript from radio programme ) <p> These opinions are often shared by the key senior officials of specific departments , such as members of the National Drug Commission . There seem to be , in addition to their ministers ' preferences , other reasons why these opinions have been so freely shared by representatives of particular departments . This might be deduced from their different interests ( see Figure 5 ) and the potential risks they feel would follow if they were to label alcohol and tobacco as drugs . The reasons for their hesitation to incorporate legal drugs in the larger drug policy are identified below . First , the current alcohol and tobacco policy is effectively " owned " by the department of health . Those persons working for that ministry might fear losing their exclusive position as well as potentially being placed under wider interdepartmental control : <p> The department of Health failed to observe developments and changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost nothing . because nobody else cares . ( Interview No. 2 ) <p> Second , justice departments do not view the area of licit drug enforcement as attractive , especially in comparison with that of illicit drugs , despite the well documented need to improve their record in such activities : ( n14 ) <p> . reporters sent a 12 year old boy to buy a bottle of spirits . He went in 15 shops , and you can guess how many times he succeeded . ( Belckov 2003 , p. 18 ) <p> Most surprisingly , alcohol and tobacco policy does not attract much media attention . <p> Third , by labelling tobacco and alcohol as drugs , these commodities would gain a status similar to that of illicit drugs . This might not only challenge and compromise international and current governmental policy prohibiting certain drugs , but would also test the tolerance that exists in regard to the use of the now legal drugs , a benign perspective shared by the wider public and by politicians : <p> The government overlooks the evidence of the relationship between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems with alcohol use in a much more positive way than with illicit drugs . ( Interview No. 2 ) <p> Parents of our clients rehabilitation centre are strongly against the use of illicit drugs . But they do not see any problem if our clients would just drink a " little bit more . " ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> Fourth , identifying all drug use as a " natural " social problem could lead to its " normalization , " and loss of the topic 's attractiveness for media , and thus for politicians . This might support the shift from the " political " control of drug topics or ownership of the drug issue from politicians to " experts , " a situation that the former would not willingly tolerate . <p> POLITICIZATION <p> Between 1993 and 2005 , there was an evident shift in the major influences on Czech drug policy formulation , with experts being displaced by politicians . While in 1993 the government acknowledged that the drug issue was a problem that was properly addressed by experts ( Kalina , 1993 ) , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The recent implementation of the law providing punishment for mere drug possession , for example , occurred as a direct result of politician involvement  --  despite protests raised by the expert community . The evidence-based critique of this phenomenon suggests that politicians should not be responsible for this topic merely because they are in positions of authority . In the case of the impact analysis project for the new drug legislation ( Zabransky et al. , 2001 ) , the government reviewed the research report , and , consequently among other changes , redefined its central task as the reclassification of illicit drugs with respect to their potential health and social risks. ( n15 ) Despite this new commitment , the minister of the interior was outspokenly critical of the research itself , supporting the contentions of some policemen : <p> Experts on drugs from the department of the interior agree that albeit it impact analysis project of the new drug legislation is the first broader statistical analysis , it shows some absolutely incorrect data and conclusions , based on the philosophy of its authors . ( Dolezal , 2003 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the minister of the interior failed to support the position of his cabinet . While doing so he simultaneously provided no support for his own claims by revealing the experts he was citing or the evidence that supported those critical conclusions . Some critics now believe that the Czech police may be regaining their previous privileged position as evidenced here , where they can make contentious claims without being asked to prove them . It is also possible that the police role may be changing from primarily emphasizing their public order duties to serving as a political lobbying group . <p> In drug policy the NDS(n16) balances liberal pressures of some politicians and individuals . ( National Drug Squad , 2003 , p. 1 ) <p> These recent actions , if continued , could lead to unexpected changes in the development of national drug ( and other ) policy . This process of the politicization of drug policy is reflected in other data sources as well : <p> In this country . everybody knows how the state should behave in relation to drugs . the experts ' advice is usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all make decisions about it , and they are in fact not interested in how the reality looks . ( Belckov , 2003 , p. 18 ) <p> Everything is political . Everybody thinks it is politics and therefore feels he is an expert in it . The problem is that it is policy .. ( Interview No. 3 ) <p> One of the threats of the current drug policy is the tendency in its increasing politicization .. ( Focus group ) <p> As politicians have shown a growing interest in drugs , the inclusion of drug issues in preelection programs has occurred , along with the establishment of so-called " drug experts " in parliamentary parties and the appointment of a parliamentary subcommittee for drugs in 2001 . Plausible explanations for this rapidly growing interest may vary : increased visibility in the media , changing priorities of political parties ( e.g. , from initial concerns with the economic transformation of the country towards more mundane social problems ) , changes in foreign policy ( e.g. , preaccession negotiations over drugs with the EU ) , or a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ politics , " and this may give some politicians the impression that they are the real experts . However , the media has played a key role in all of this by devoting considerable space to the topic of illicit drugs. ( n17 ) In doing so , they seek out representatives of contrasting opinions , ( n18 ) and politicians willingly respond to such inducements in order to achieve higher visibility . <p> One illustration of how this politicization might affect drug policy making may be seen in an initiative introduced by the leader of the Christian Democrats in 2004 , the year that the government was supposed to discuss and adopt a new strategy of drug policy for the period 2005-2009 . Seemingly out of the blue , in a press conference held on February 27 , 2004 , the Christian Democrats announced that they were now supporting a new " War on Drugs . " This stance was in direct opposition to the four pillars of drug policy that had been more or less continuously implemented by various governments since they were first formulated in 1993 . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Christian Democrats ' to increase their visibility before the pending election to the European parliament and as a consequence of a recent election within the party that resulted in an effort to place a " drug policy expert " from their party in the position of manager of the National Drug Commission . <p> According to the Christian Democrats , the recent liberal drug policy had been a long-term failure  --  as demonstrated by the fact that there had recently been a reported increase in the life-time prevalence of marijuana and ecstasy use . They failed to mention anything about the accompanying reported decrease in problem drug use and related harms during this same period , however . These politicians argued that one of the biggest mistakes in past drug policy had been its differentiated approach towards various types of drugs ( based on the understanding that some drugs are more harmful than others ) . They asserted that this relativistic stance sent a message of approval of the use of certain drugs , and in doing so overlooked the fact that all illicit use was both harmful and immoral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the numbers of problem drug users , drug related deaths , and/or bloodborne viruses  --  were said to be intentionally biased in order to support the continuation of the more liberal policy . The suggestions by current policy makers that legal drugs such as alcohol and tobacco should be brought under the drug policy umbrella was perceived by Christian Democrats as an attempt to divert public attention from the fact of a failing policy towards illicit drugs . These claims were made in support of a perceived need to significantly change recent liberal drug policy by adopting a more punitive one that would be reflected in the text of the drug policy strategy for 2005-2009 ( which was being drafted at that time ) . <p> On the basis of these allegations , the Christian Democrats initiated several high level meetings of heads of three governmental coalition parties that convened with an agenda of tightening the Czech drug policy . Following widely publicized lengthy political discussions , the Christian Democrats presented their proposal for complex systemic changes in Czech drug policy . Their specific recommendations included ( 1 ) replacing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servant responsible for drug policy formulation and coordination ; ( 2 ) the elimination of the National Focal Point ( a group responsible for monitoring and reporting about drug issues ) , or if it is to be continued , placing it under the control of the ministry of health , whose leadership supports Christian Democrat ideals ; and ( 3 ) emphasizing law enforcement and primary prevention measures , while downplaying treatment , and especially harm reduction , within the national drug policy . <p> The Christian Democratic initiative was widely criticized by the long recognized community of drug experts , including those working in the Czech Republic and other European countries , as well as by a portion of the national media . In this atmosphere , the prime minister , who was chairing the meetings of heads of governmental political parties , demanded that the Christian Democrats provide clear evidence supporting their claims about the failure of past drug policy efforts and in support of the changes they were recommending . This evidence was never presented , however , and the whole Christian Democratic initiative slowly faded out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that these actions did not contribute to ( 1 ) the party 's relative success in the election to the European parliament , ( 2 ) destabilization of the current system of drug policy , ( 3 ) the termination of certain harm reduction activities ( i.e. , the funding of pill testing programs , initiation of the certification of drug services in order to assure their quality ) , and ( 4 ) delays in the preparation of the 2005-2009 drug policy . The completed strategy document was finally approved in December 2004 and did not contain any of the changes recommended by the Christian Democrats . Due to the delay in its completion , however , the adoption of the strategy and its provisions was not reflected in the allocation of financial sources as the state budget for 2005 had been deliberated in parliament earlier in September 2004 . <p> STATUTORY VERSUS NONSTATUTORY SECTOR <p> In 1993 , the " monopoly enjoyed by the traditional psychiatric approach was still remaining from the past " ( Kalina , 1993 , p. 5 ) in the drug field . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have fostered the entry of nonmedical professionals onto the scene , persons who were typically recruited from the nonstatutory sector ( NGOs ) . Since then , the NGOs have rapidly extended the spectrum of their drug services in order to fill existing gaps in the treatment sector and by implementing a variety of alternative programs. ( n19 ) They now dominate the field in the most controversial area  --  harm reduction ( Csemy &; Krch , 2001 )  --  and have become strong supporters of multi-agency Cooperation . Along with their increasing professionalism , NGOs began to challenge some of the orthodox medical approaches , for example , the view of addiction as a disease and total abstinence as the sole aim of treatment . Presumably these older perspectives , in combination with the traditional approach approved earlier under the communist regime where all treatment and social services were exclusively provided by statutory institutions , have contributed to the state 's conservative stance towards NGOs : <p> We NGOs never know how much money we will get next year . We have to write applications for funds every year .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they do not bother to prove their effectiveness or to write annual reports .. ( Interview No. 3 ) <p> Statutory treatment programs for drug users are funded directly and consistently from public sources , and there is no requirement that they demonstrate the quality of the services they provide or their effectiveness in order to receive funds . In sharp contrast , the NGOs have to submit annual applications for funding from the state and regional authorities , and they never receive the amounts requested . <p> . while they statutory programmes get paid 100% , we get at the most 70% , often even less from the state .. ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> Whereas the statutory programs are paid according to the number of clients they provide care to , the funds for NGOs are not disbursed in the same way . Czech legislation allows NGOs to obtain funds amounting to a maximum of 70% of their annual budgets from state sources . They are obliged to raise the remaining 30% on their own from other sources. ( n20 ) In sharp contrast to the statutory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NGO programs . <p> Last year we got just 80% of what we applied for 70% of annual budget and the money came at the end of June .. ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> The funds for the NGOs are quite often cut , in which case they receive even less than 70% of their annual budget , and then not at the beginning of the calendar year ( as in the case of statutory institutions ) , but often in the period as late as May or even August . Last year three trained workers left , this year two . Now , we have just two fully trained workers . ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> The current funding policy jeopardizes the stability and quality of nongovernmental drug services as financial insecurity forces trained workers to leave . Therefore , the NGOs have actively supported every attempt to implement higher standards of service , certification , and evaluations of their effectiveness . In doing so , they hope that this will bring them equal opportunity and stability in the same sense that state programs and workers enjoy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of services for the public . Therefore , the same demands regarding quality and effectiveness and equal conditions must be applied to both .. ( National Drug Commission , 2000 , p. 13 ) <p> The difficult situation faced by the Czech NGOs has fostered support for the establishment of their umbrella organization  --  Association of NGOs ( ANO ) . Initially established to support the ideals of harm reduction , this organization soon became a platform for groups providing treatment and prevention interventions at the local level . Czech NGO representatives have high hopes about the potentially positive influence the EU may have by promoting equality between the statutory and nonstatutory sectors in the drug field : <p> There are different models of the NGOs ' funding in the EU . They workers of drug programmes in the United Kingdom told us that they would n't work in such conditions . ( Interview No. 5 ) <p> There is a different culture and traditions in relation to the NGOs in Western Europe . Here , we NGOs are still new and some politicians and departments suspect that we only want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) <p> It appears that the long-term unbroken tradition of democracy and civil societal developments have created more satisfactory conditions for the work of the NGOs in the EU generally than is found in the Czech Republic specifically . <p> LEGISLATION <p> Various components of drug-related legislation , and not only the penal code , create the necessary framework for enhancing opportunities and eliminating obstacles to a rational and pragmatic policy . Earlier , for . example , we discussed the 1999 legislation , which implemented a punishment for drug possession . For some , this represents a regression in drug policy , as it goes against the mainstream practices of the EU member states , which are shifting towards some relaxation of criminal laws as they apply to drug possession . In the Czech Republic , the populist assumption of representatives of the Christian Democratic Party was that a repressive approach would lead to a decrease in drug use and drug availability . The experiences of other countries in this regard , however , do not support such claims ( Zabransky et al. , 2001 ) . Czech domestic drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reform : <p> . it is virtually impossible to transfer new approaches from the EU into an unprepared legislative environment .. for example . the methadone substitution programmes . ( Interview No. 2 ) <p> We Department of Health have difficulties in implementing programmes or funding them if they virtually do not exist in legislation . ( Interview No. 1 ) <p> These legislative obstacles appear to be consequences of outdated legislation about health services , as in the case of the already mentioned act regarding the protection against alcoholism and other toxic manias that was approved by the communist parliament in 1989 . That statute does not reflect changes that have taken place in patterns of drug use , the decentralization of public administration , privatization of medical facilities , new ways of funding , or the establishment of new types of nonmedical services . Similar problems appear in the social policy arena : <p> The law on . new types of social services already existing in practice still was n't approved by Parliament . We worked on that again and again for more than five years . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had difficulty reaching a pragmatic and realistic consensus , not only in regards to drug policy , but also to health and social care . The problem seems to be a by-product of the prioritization of the paternalistic model of social control of society ( as evidenced by the rapid adoption of legislation introducing punishment for drug possession ) to the health and social issues that are critical to public life . For more than 15 years there have been discussions about legislation regarding health and social policy , but all without any result . CONCLUSIONS <p> This paper has argued that drug policy as a social product results from the permanent interplay among three types of influence : ( 1 ) external , ( 2 ) local drug non-specific , and ( 3 ) local drug specific , and that the individual significance of each of these in relation to drug policy is constantly changing over time . The crucial influence of the key players in the drug arena and the ways in which they conceptualize drugs and drug use are major issues for discussion . This circumstance may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the latter case , such actions will contribute to the continued definition of vague , unrealistic , and unattainable objectives and aims of drug policy as well as in the measures and interventions developed to respond to the drug problem . <p> The conflicts that exist between the rhetoric and practice of Czech drug policy result from the interplay of the unique perspectives and relative powers of various groups of professionals , civil servants , and politicians . The discrepancies that exist between official statements and actual practices present significant obstacles to the attainment of an efficient Czech drug policy . The main conflicts contributing to this ineffectiveness have been observed in the following areas : <p> ( 1 ) among various and often conflicting interests of key players <p> ( 2 ) between specific aims and general philosophical principles <p> ( 3 ) in the relative balance of drug supply and demand reduction measures <p> ( 4 ) in the efforts to control illicit and licit drugs <p> ( 5 ) among the experts and the politicians <p> ( 6 ) in the statutory and nonstatutory sectors <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> The biggest threat to a pragmatic and evidence based policy seems to be its politicization , as observed here in the Czech case . <p> Despite the rhetoric of official political documents , Czech drug policy seems to be pragmatically driven by political and moral rather than public health concerns . As such , the policy remains ill defined with the main goal being the unattainable objective of reducing drug use . Despite its proclamations , Czech drug policy does not currently build on the scientific evidence . While advocating a balanced approach in the abstract , in reality it favors repressive law enforcement measures . Similarly , in developing legislation related to drugs , decision makers find it easier to reach some consensus regarding the adoption of law enforcement measures , but difficult or impossible to do so for public health related measures . <p> There are several limitations to this study . First , there is always the risk of personal bias in the interpretation of data . Second , it is also possible that all significant factors were not examined , making this analysis incomplete . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other factors that they perceive to be more important than those that were covered here . Third , it is difficult to prove that something did or did not happen as a direct result of implemented drug policy . For example , it is impossible to Confirm or to disprove the claim of the director of the National Drug Squad that drugs would have been more accessible in the Czech Republic if the punishment for drug possession had not been implemented. ( n21 ) Fourth , there is little existing research on drug policy making in the Czech Republic that could be used to support the author 's interpretation of this data . Given these qualifiers , it is recommended that the usual caveats be applied here : more research is needed in the Czech Republic . <p> Further research is also needed in order to gain a better understanding of the processes influencing decision making regarding drug issues . This seems to be especially necessary with the increasing use of illegal ( but also legal ) substances in almost all parts of the world , the effective normalization of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parker , 1994 ) , and their criminalization and social exclusion under the current international and national drug policies .
