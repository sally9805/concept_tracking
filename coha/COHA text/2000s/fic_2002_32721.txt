BLACK WATER A MERCI RAYBORN NOVEL By T. Jefferson Parker HYPERION Archie pushed the gearshift into third and set his hand on her knee . Coast Highway , southbound . Man in the moon big and close , like he was tilting his head for a peek down into the convertible . Archie glanced up , could n't tell if the guy was smiling or frowning . Did n't care because Gwen 's skin was warm through the dress , a few degrees warmer than the breeze gusting through the car . He looked at the speedometer then at her . Saw her hair moving , her face sketched in the orange glow of the dashboard lights . A silver champagne flute in one hand , a smile . Archie pretended he 'd never seen her before . Pretended he was trying to look at something elsethe squid boat off of Crystal Cove in a pool of white light , sayonly to have this Gwen creature drop into his world like some special effect . There she was . What luck . He lifted the hem of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She eased back in the seat a little and he heard the breath catch in her throat . He caught the faint smell of her , windblown but unmistakable . Archie had a sharp nose and loved what it brought him . Like right now , the milk-and-orange-blossoms smell of Gwen , bass scent of his life . All the other notes that came to himcoastal sage and the ocean , the new car leatherwere just the riffs and fills . She smiled and tossed the plastic champagne flute in the air , the darkness stealing it without a sound . Then she slid her hand under there with his , popping up the cotton dress and letting it settle like a bedspread while she trailed a finger down his forearm and over his wrist . " Long way home , Arch . " " Five whole miles . " " What a night . It 's cool when we mix our friends and they get along . " " They 're all great . Priscilla drank a lot . " " The cops put it away , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . " " Worth it . You only turn twenty-six once . " Gwen 's curls lifted in a random swirl and she pulled his hand in a little closer . She did n't speak for a long moment . " Twenty-six . I 'm lucky . Will you love me when I 'm thirty-six ? Eighty-six ? " " Done deal . " " I 'm really sorry about earlier . " " Forget it . I have . Damned temper . " A serene moment then , as the roar of the engine mixed with the comfort of forgiveness . " I ca n't wait to get home , Arch . I 'll be outrageously demanding , since it 's my birthday . It is still my birthday , is n't it ? " " For about three minutes . " " Hmmm . Maybe you ought to pull over . " Archie downshifted and looked for a turn off the highway . There was one at the state beach , one for the trailer park , another one back by the juice stand . They 'd used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved to do . She 'd sit on his lap with her back to him . Up that high she looked like a tourist craning for a view of something , one hand on the armrest and the other on the dash . The great thing about the new convertible was he could look up past the back of Gwen 's head at the stars , then at her again , put his nose in her hair or against her neck and wonder what he 'd done to deserve her . For a young man , Archie Wildcraft was not a complete fool , because he understood , at thirty , that he 'd done nothing at all to deserve her . Dumb luck , pure and simple . " There 's the turn , " she said , pointing . " I love you , " he said . " I love you , Arch . You 're always going to be my man , are n't you . " It was n't really a question so he did n't answer . He braked and steered off the highway and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jerked awake when he heard something loud in the living room . Gwen slept right through it , so Archie cupped one hand firmly over her mouth as he raised her from sleep . Her eyes grew large as he whispered what he 'd heard . He prodded her out of the bed and toward the bathroom , which was where Archie had told her to go if something like this ever happened . All the time Archie was trying to listen but he heard nothing from the living room , the house , the whole world . He watched as she pulled her new purple robe off the floor and moved through the room shadows toward the bath . Archie got a nine-millimeter autoloader from under the bed . He set it on his pillow while he pulled on his underwearcomic , " Happy Birthday , I 'm Yours " boxers with a big red ribbon printed around the opening . They 'd made her laugh . Him too , and they 'd made love again and fallen asleep damp and tangled in the sheets . He put on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the phone and carried it toward the bathroom , where a thin horizon of light shone under the door . He opened it and gave her the phone and whispered do n't worry this guy picked the wrong house to burgle maybe just a bird flew into a window if something goes wrong call 911 but let me check it out first . I 'll call it now , Archie . Do n't call it until I tell you to call it . Turn out the light the twenty-two 's under the sink with a full clip and one in the chamber . The safety 's down by the trigger guard push it ' til the red shows . Be careful . I 'll be careful . Archie got his flashlight and walked out of the room and into the familiar hallway . Carpet , bare feet hardly making a sound . There was a light switch at the end of the hall , where it opened to the living room . He flipped it on but did n't step in , just stood there scanning right to left then back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sofa , window blinds with a big hole in them , chair , wall with a painting , Gwen 's birthday presents on the floor . Then the same things again , but in reverse . He looked down at the big rock in the middle of the living room carpet . Size of a grapefruit . Saw the shards of glass twinkling near the sliding glass door . Saw where the wooden blinds had been splintered when the rock came through . Offed the light and listened . The refrigerator hummed and car tires hissed in the distance . Archie moved quietly into the kitchen and hit another light . Empty and undisturbed . Breakfast nook the same . Little family room with the TV and fireplace looked fine , too , just the VCR clock glowing a steady 4:28 A.M. He checked the bath and the laundry room . Went back to the living room and shined his flashlight down on the rock . Kind of a rounded square , red and smooth with clear skinny marbles running through it like fat . Gneiss , thought Archie , veined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something infantile and destructive like this . Kids , probablydo n't know who lives here , just want to bust something up , video it , have a story to tell . Maybe some forgotten creep he 'd shoved around in Orange County jail when he started work eight years ago . Cops make enemies every day and Archie had made his . They all came to his mind , though none more than any other . The crime lab could get latents off that gneiss . All of this sped through Archie 's brain as he unlocked the front door , slipped outside and quietly pulled the door shut behind him . The moon was gone so he turned on the flashlight , scanned the porch and the bushes around it . A rabbit crashed through the leaves and Archie 's heart jumped . He stepped down to the walkway . It was lined with Chinese flame trees and yellow hibiscus and bird-of-paradise . The drooping branches of the flame trees made a tunnel . Archie followed the walk around to the back , moving his light beam with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stayed on the walk and it led him around the swimming pool . The water was flat and polished and Archie remarked for maybe the millionth time what a beautiful home they lived in now , big but plenty of charm , on a double lot in the hills with this pool and a three-car garage and palm trees fifty feet high leading up the driveway . An extra room for his viewing stones . An extra room for Gwen 's music . An extra room for the baby someday . He continued along the curving walkway then stopped in front of the slider where the rock had come through . The beam of his flashlight picked up the big ragged hole and the gleam of fissures spreading in all directions . He saw no footprints , no disturbance of the grass . Archie stood still and listened , clicked off his flashlight . Never did hear a getaway car . Kids , he thought again : they would throw the rock , haul ass giggling along the west fence , jump it at the corner and be down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He thought of her just then , standing in the hard light with her robe on , hair all messed up , scared as a bird and listening to every little sound , the twenty-two probably still in the cabinet under the sink because she did n't like guns . And he thought what a jealous little jerk he 'd been for a few minutes at the party . Married to her for eight years and he 'd still feel his anger rise when his own friends hugged and kissed her . He missed her . Wondered what in hell he was doing out here with his happy birthday boxers and a gun and his wife afraid in a locked bathroom a hundred feet away . He turned back up the walk . Past the pool . Into the tunnel of trees . Then a beam of sharp light in his eyes and by the time he found the flashlight button it was too late . Up close , an orange explosion . Bright white light and Archie watching himself fly into it , a bug in the universe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded at the two deputies standing at the front door of the Wildcraft house . One of them handed her an Order-of-Entry log , which she signed after checking her watch . She was a tall woman with a dark ponytail that rode up the orange letters on the back of her windbreaker as she wrote , then down again as she handed back the clipboard . " Who got here first and where are they ? " " Crowder and Dobbs , Sergeant . In the kitchen area , I believe . " The other uniform looked past her head and said nothing . In the entryway Merci Rayborn stood still and received . Smell of furniture wax and wood . Smell of flowers . Murmur of voices . She looked at the entryway mirror , the living room furniture , the carpet . She looked at the hole in the blinds , which suggested a hole in the glass behind . She looked at a rock the size of a newborn 's head lying near the middle of the floor . At the little pile of gift boxes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paul Zamorra came softly down the hallway , light on his feet . And dark in his heart , Merci thought . He had the gentle deliberateness of an undertaker . And the black suit , too . She turned to her partner . " Paul . Do you know this guy ? " " Not well . You know , just a friendly face . We 'd talked . " " Wildcraft . I 'm sure we talked , too . " ( Continues ... )
