When the same nightmare awakens her , she sits bolt upright in the middle of the bed . Where am I ? she thinks . And blinks at the bedside clock . 7:15 A.M. She is instantly wide awake . " Kids ! " she yells . " Jamie ! Ashley ! Up ! We 're late ! Up , guys ! " She hears grumbling down the hall . Ashley 's voice . Jamie has n't spoken for almost eight months now . " Guys , are you up ? " she shouts . " Yes , Mom ! " Ashley calls . Ten years old , the elder of the two . Her eyes and her hair brown , like Alice 's . Eight-year-old Jamie favors his father . Blond hair and blue eyes . She can never look into those eyes without recalling that terrible day . She shakes off the nightmare and gets out of bed . In the shower , she realizes she set the alarm 's wakeup time , but neglected to slide the on-off switch to the right . Hurrying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ falling onto the little toe of her left foot . Yelping in pain  --  it feels as if someone has hit her with a hammer  --  she yells , " Damn it to hell ! " and bends down to recover the slippery bar . Her butt hits the hot-cold lever on the tiled wall . The water turns instantly ice cold . She straightens in surprise , drops the soap again , missing her foot this time , and backs away from the icy stream , thinking None of this would be happening if Eddie were still alive . But Eddie is not still alive , she thinks , Eddie is dead  --  and almost bursts into tears . She reaches through the slanting curtain of frigid water , and turns off the shower . The kids are supposed to be at school at eight-fifteen . She is twenty minutes late getting them there . Jamie has forgotten his lucky red cap , so she has to drive all the way back to the house for it , the traffic on U.S. 41 impossible even now in the off-season . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school , and then drives to the office on The Ring , it is almost 9:30 . Her appointment with Reginald Webster is at ten . She barely has time to check her e-mail , go over the new listings that Aggie has placed on her desk , put on some lipstick , which she did n't have time to do before they left the house , visit the ladies ' room one last time , and here he is ! Forty-three years old perhaps , tall and somewhat good-looking in a dissipated way , suntanned from hours spent aboard his thirty-foot Catalina . He is looking for a house on deep sailboat water . " People call me Webb , " he says . " Better than Reggie , do n't you think ? " Holding her hand . " Anything 's better than Reggie . Have you found some good houses for me ? " " I think so , " she says , and withdraws her hand . " Would you care for some coffee , or should we just get started ? " " I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he says . She buzzes for Aggie and asks her to bring in two cups of coffee . While they are waiting , she shows Webb pictures of the dozen or so houses she 's pulled from the internet . He seems interested in two of them on Willard , and another one out on Tall Grass . The two keys are at opposite ends of Cape October . It is going to be a long day . Aggie comes in carrying a tray with two coffee cups , a creamer , and a sugar bowl on it . As she is placing the creamer and sugar bowl on the desk , she accidentally knocks over Webb 's cup , spilling the contents onto his left trouser leg . He jumps up , bellowing in surprise , and then immediately recovers his cool . " That 's okay , " he says , and laughs . " I 'm about coffeed out , anyway . " She is starting to tell Reginald Webster how Cape October got its name . They have already seen the two houses on Willard Key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because that 's when the first tourists come down , " Webb says . " October . " " No , no , " she says . " Actually , the name is an odd combination of Seminole and Spanish . " She goes on to explain that when the Spaniards first came to southwest Florida , the Seminole word tha-kee for " big " was already in place , and they added the Spanish word cabo to it , and came up with the name " Cabo Tha-kee , " or " Big Cape . " This eventually became slurred and contracted to " Cab'Otha-kee , " which was then finally Hispanicized to " Cab'Octubre , " which of course was " Cape October " in English . " Or so the story goes , " she says , and turns to him and smiles . The eastern rim of October Bay is jaggedly defined by U.S. 41 , more familiarly known as the Tamiami Trail . Frank Lane , the owner and sole proprietor of Lane Realty , believes that " Tamiami " is redneck for " To Miami @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . But if you follow 41 south , it leads eventually to Alligator Alley , which then crosses the Florida peninsula to the east coast and , of course , Miami . So maybe he 's right . There are four keys off the Cape 's mainland . Beyond these so-called barrier islands lies the vast Gulf of Mexico . Sail out due west from the Cape , and eventually you 'll make landfall in Corpus Christi , Texas . If you 're lucky . " So how old are you , Alice ? " he asks her . " May I call you Alice ? " " Sure , " she says . " So how old are you , Alice ? " he asks again . She does n't think that 's any of his business , but he is a client , and neither does she wish to appear rude . " Thirty-four , " she says . " Married ? " " Widowed . " " Sorry to hear that . " " Yes , " she says . " Any children ? " " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . " " Yes , " she says again . " How long ago ? " he asks . " You know , " she says , " I 'm sorry , but I 'd rather not talk about it . " " Okay , " he says , and shrugs . " Sorry . I did n't mean to intrude . " " That 's okay , " she says , and then softens her tone . " It 's just that it 's still painful . " " Must 've been recent then , huh ? " he says , and when she does n't answer , he says , " Sorry . " They ride in silence for several moments . " Was it an accident ? " he asks . She does n't answer . " Sometimes it helps to talk about it , " he says . " I figure he had to 've been young , right ? I mean , you 're only thirty-four . So it had to 've been either a heart attack or some kind of accident , am I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Alice says , and Webb remains silent for the rest of the trip to Tall Grass . " The house was built in 1956 , " she tells him . " Named for Jennifer Bray Healey , who had it designed by Thomas Cooley and his son . They 're famous Cape October architects . " " Never heard of them , " Webb says . " They designed a great many of the buildings downtown , I 'll take you to see some of them later , if you like . The Healey house is considered a hallmark of the Cape 's modern architectural movement . " They are standing in the oval driveway in front of the house . Alice is deliberately postponing that moment when she unlocks the front door and opens it onto the spectacular panoramic view of Little October Bay . It never fails to knock the socks off any prospective buyer . " The house fell into disrepair after Mrs. Healey died , " she says , searching in her bag for the key to the lockbox . " The present owners  --  Frank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They 've been renovating it ever since , all in accordance with historic guidelines . The rules are that you can make changes provided you do n't alter any ' historically or architecturally significant aspects of the design , ' quote unquote . " " Sounds like bureaucratic red tape , " Webb says . " Well , no , not actually . The regulations are there to protect the environment and the property itself . This is a landmark house , you know . " " Mm , " he says . " Ah , here it is , " she says , and finds the key to the lockbox , and then opens the box , and removes the key to the front door . " The owners are up north , " she says over her shoulder , " they also have a home in North Carolina . " She inserts the key into the lock on the front door , twists the key , opens the door , turns to him , and says , " Please come in . " The view is truly breathtaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the living room to the sliding glass doors at the rear of the house , and beyond those doors to the wooden platforms that drop gradually from one to the other , down to the dock where a thirty-two-foot Seaward Eagle is moored to the pilings . Out over the bay , a squadron of central casting pelicans swoop low over the calm silent waters . " Nice , " Webb says . " And you get this same magnificent view from every room in the house , " she says . " Was it a boating accident ? " he asks . " Yes , " she says briefly , and leads him through the living room , past the fireplace ... " That 's fossil stone , " she says . " The chimney 's been restored , with a new flue and top . The cedar floors are new , too , throughout the entire house . " " Out here on the Bay ? " he asks . " The Gulf , " she says , again briefly , and opens one of the sliding doors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the renovation , this hardware is all new , " she says , and steps out onto the first of the platforms . " The decks were all replaced and enlarged , too , " she says . " Highest grade , clean-cut , dense dry wood and stainless steel screws ... " ... and walks him down to the dock itself . " Note the swimming pool and privacy garden just off the master bedroom , " she says . The Allenbys ' power cruiser sits bobbing gently alongside the dock . " The dock is new , forty feet long . It can hold one large and two small boats , or a second boat up to twenty feet . Dual 50 AMP service to the dock . Full access to the Gulf of Mexico , no bridges on the way . " " When did you start selling real estate ? " " Almost six months ago , " she says . " Lots of widows in the real estate game , " he says . " I had n't noticed . " " Widows and divorces . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him that this is more than busywork , this is her way of starting a new life , her way of coping with the aftermath of her husband 's senseless death , when her very existence was shattered ... She catches herself , looks out over the water . " It 's so utterly still here , " she says . She allows him to stand on the dock in silence for a while , savoring the solitude and the majestic view . " Come , " she says , " let me show you the rest of the house . " Inside again , she shows him the kitchen with its custom teak countertop and hand-built , hand-painted kitchen cabinets , its Miele and Thermador appliances ... " A water softener has been added to the entire house , " she says , " and there 's a new two-zone air-conditioning system with all new ducts . All the plumbing and plumbing hardware was replaced , too , including a new line to the street . There 's a new irrigation system , a new well pump , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be getting a brand new house that just happens to be a historic landmark as well . " She takes him into the large room on the southern end of the house . From Frank Allenby 's spacious desk , the view over the bay is spectacular . " This is actually a second bedroom , " she says , " it has its own private bath . But the Allenbys live here alone , so Frank uses it as an office . " " They say it takes a year , " Webb says . " I beg your pardon ? " " To get over a divorce or a death . " She says nothing . " I 've been divorced for nine months now . You suppose they 're right ? " he asks . " I have no idea . " " Are you over it yet ? " " I get by , " she says . Which is n't true . She is struggling . She is struggling mightily . " The master bedroom is at the other end of the house , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Think of the house as a beautiful butterfly , the living room and dining room as its body , the two bedrooms as its wings . " " How large is the living room ? " " Twenty by thirty . That 's a good-sized room . " " And the bedrooms ? " " Each fifteen by twenty . Come , let me show you the other one . Total square footage under air is a bit over three thousand . " She leads him through the house again , past the living room , and into the dining room , and then through to the master bedroom . " From the bed , you can look right down into the privacy garden and the pool , " she says . " How much are they asking ? " " A million-seven . They 've been offered a mill-four but they turned it down . I think they might be willing to let it go for a mill-six , somewhere in there . " " That 's a lot of money , " he says . " Not for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " A million-six comes to more than five hundred dollars a square foot . " " You 've got to figure a million for the property alone , " she says . " You wo n't find many other views like this one . " " Well , I 'll have to think about it , " he says , and her heart sinks . She gets back to the office at a quarter past noon . They exchange phone numbers , and Alice promises to have some new houses to show him by tomorrow morning at nine , when they 'll go out looking again . She hopes he might call before then with an offer on any of the three houses she 's shown him , but she knows this is unlikely . He 'd told her he was looking for something that would cost no more than a million , a million-five , and she 'd assured him that getting an eighty percent mortgage would be no problem . That means he would have to come up with $320,000 in cash if he goes for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Frank and Marcia Allenby will never budge below a million-six , never . Of the seven percent commission on the sale , the agency will keep three and Alice will take home four , which comes to $64,000 . She figures that will carry her a good year and more , even if she does n't make another sale , a likelihood in that she has n't made a sale thus far , and she 's already been working for Lane Realty for almost six months now . She took the job at the end of November , when she realized she was n't going to be able to make it on the scant savings she and Eddie had managed to accumulate since their move to Florida . The house she still lives in with the kids is in a good school district , even if it does cost $1,600 a month , which at her present rate of cash flow she will no longer be able to afford come June , unless Mr. Reginald Webster or somebody or anybody buys something . Or unless , of course , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a month and a half ago . She picks up the phone , dials a number by heart , and waits . " Briggs , Randolph and Soames , " a woman 's voice says . " Mr. Briggs , please , " she says . " May I say who 's calling ? " " Alice Glendenning . " " One moment , please . " She waits . " Hi , Alice , " a man 's voice says . " Hello , Andy , how are you ? " " Good , thanks , and you ? " " Fine , Andy . Andy , I hate to keep bothering you about this ... " " It 's no bother at all , " Andy says . " I 'm as annoyed as you are . " " Have you heard anything from them ? " " They 're still stalling . " " It 's been eight months now , " she says . " What proof do they need ? " " A certificate of death , they say . Which is absurd in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were never ... forgive me , Alice , " he says . " That 's all right . " " But the facts ... " She knows the facts . Eddie took the sloop out for a moonlight sail . It was a small boat , the waters on the Gulf were very high that night . There was no one aboard when the tanker came across her the next morning , still under sail . Eddie had either fallen overboard or been washed overboard . Those were the facts . " Garland has no right to withhold payment , " Andy says . " But they are . " " Yes , because there 's a lot of money involved here . And because they 're in trouble financially , this goddamn administration . With the double indemnity clause , the death benefit comes to two ... by the way , no one at Garland is claiming that drowning at sea does n't qualify as an accident . " " Well , they 'd be foolish to do that . " " They 're foolish to try wriggling out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paying the same sorts of claims , you know . It 's not as if nothing like this has ever happened before , Alice ... " " I know . " " Some are taking more time than others , but they are honoring their obligations . Quite frankly , Garland 's position is contemptible . " " So what do we do , Andy ? " " I 'd like to give them till the end of the month . If they do n't settle by then , we 'll have to bring suit . " " The end of the month , " Alice says . " Yes . I 'll call them again on June first . Does that sound okay to you ? " " I suppose . " " Alice ? " " Yes ? " " We 'll get the money , I promise you . " " I hope so . " " I promise . " " Okay , Andy , thank you . We 'll talk soon . " " I 'll let you know the moment I hear anything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later , " he says , and hangs up . She holds the receiver in her hand for a moment , and then puts it back on the cradle , and suddenly she is weeping . She yanks a tissue from the box on her desk , blows her nose , and dries her eyes . Well , she thinks , the first day of June is less than three weeks away , and I 've certainly got enough in the bank to last me till then . But I do n't know what to do after June first , because by my calculation the account will be getting very low by that time . I suppose I can always get a job waitressing , she thinks , but that would mean having to pay Rosie even more than I 'm paying her now . But at least I 'll have a steady salary and tips , and I would n't have to count on commissions . So far , there has been what one might call a dearth of commissions . So far , the commissions have totaled zero , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dials her home number , and waits . Rosie Garrity picks up on the third ring . " Glendenning residence , " she says . " Rosie , hi , it 's me . " " Hello , Mrs. Glendenning , how are you ? " " Fine , thanks . Everything okay there ? " " Yes , fine . What time is it , anyway ? " " A quarter to one . " " Good . I want to bake a pie before the kids get home . " Rosie comes in at noon every weekday , in time to clean the house and put it in order before the children get home at two-thirty , three o'clock , depending on traffic . By the time Alice gets home at five , Rosie has everything ready to put up for dinner . Rosie works full-time on Saturdays and Sundays , a broker 's busiest days . " Did you see the chicken I left in the fridge ? " Alice asks . " Yes . Will you be wanting the spinach , too ? " " Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ browning . " " Sounds good . Can you stop for some ice cream on the way home ? Go good with the pie . " " What kind of pie ? " " Blueberry . " " Yum . I 'll pick some up . " " See you later . " " Bye . " It is almost one o'clock . She decides to go to lunch . Grosse Bec is a man-made island that serves as a luxurious stepping-stone between the mainland and Willard Key . If Cape October can claim a Gold Coast shopping area , the so-called Ring on Grosse Bec is it . The rest of the town is all malls . Alice 's office is on Mapes Avenue , just off the circle that serves as Grosse Bec 's center . She is just crossing Founders Boulevard , familiarly called Flounders Boulevard by the natives , when she hears a horn blowing , and then the squeal of brakes , and then a woman 's voice shouting , " Oh God ! " She whirls in time to see the red fender of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tries to spin away again , too late , and then thrusts both hands at the fender in desperation , as if trying to push it off her , away from her . Bracing herself for sudden impact , she feels the bone-jarring shock of metal against flesh , and is suddenly hurtling backward off her feet , landing some three feet away from the car 's right front wheel . She feels agonizing pain in her left leg , tries to twist away from the pain , and then does in fact twist away from the car itself , as if it were still a menace . " Oh God , are you all right ? " The woman is crouched beside her now . Alice looks up into an elegant face , long blonde hair trailing on either side of it , blue eyes almost brimming with tears . " Are you okay ? " the woman asks . " No , " Alice says . The woman 's looming face vanishes . Alice hears a car door opening . Then some clicking and beeping sounds , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she says , " there 's been an accident . " She is talking into a cell phone . " Can you send an ambulance , please ? " The ambulance gets there some five minutes later . The police still have n't arrived by the time the paramedics load Alice and drive off with her . The emergency room doctor at October Memorial tells Alice she 's broken her left ankle . He tells her he will put her foot in a so-called cuff cast , which will look like an oversized white ski boot . He assures her she will still be able to drive because all she needs for the accelerator and brake pedals is her right foot . He tells her walking will be awkward and cumbersome , but he does n't think she 'll need crutches . He is smiling as he tells her all this . He seems to think she is very lucky . It takes an hour and twenty minutes for them to clean the wound , and dress it , and put her foot and ankle in the cast . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . Cumbersome and awkward is right . The woman who knocked her down is waiting there for her . " I 'm Jennifer Redding , " she says , " I ca n't tell you how sorry I am . " Alice guesses she is a good ten years younger than she herself , twenty-four or - five , in there , a willowy blonde wearing tight white bell-bottom pants with a thirteen-button flap like sailors used to wear , or maybe still did ; Alice has n't dated a sailor since she was nineteen . The pants are riding low on Jennifer 's hips , a short pink cotton sweater riding high . In combination , they expose a good four inches of firm flesh and a tight little belly button as well . " I 'm glad you 're here , " Alice says . " I never got your insurance information . " " Why do you need that ? " " Well , there 's been an accident ... " " There must be a card in my wallet someplace . " " Did n't the cops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " At the scene . " " There were n't any cops . " " Did n't you call the police ? " " No . Was I supposed to ? " Alice suddenly realizes she is talking to a ditz . " Did n't anyone call the cops ? " " What for ? The ambulance came , you were already gone . " " I hate to break this to you , " Alice says , " but if you drive away from the scene of an accident , it becomes a hit-and-run . If I were you ... " " But I was n't running from anything . I drove straight here to the hospital . To see how you were . " " The police may look at that differently . Get on your cell phone again , dial 911 , and tell them  --  " " Is it broken ? " Jennifer asks , looking down at the cast . " Yes , it 's broken . " " I 'm sorry . " " You should n't have come around that corner so fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have at least slowed down . " " I did . But you walked right into the car . " " I what ? " " You seemed to be in some kind of a fog . " " Is that what you 're going to tell the cops ? That I was in some kind of a fog ? " " I 'm not going to tell the cops anything . " " Well , I am , " Alice says . " Why ? " " Because I 've had experience with insurance companies , thanks . And there are going to be hospital bills , and I want to go on record about what happened here . Especially if you 're going to claim I was in a fog and walked into your car . " " I even blew my horn at you . You just kept walking . " " Jennifer , it was nice of you to come here , really , but I am going to report this to the police . You 'd be smart to call them first . Otherwise you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't be silly , " Jennifer says . " Have you got a ride home ? " " No , but I 'll call my office . My car 's  --  " " I 'd be happy to give you a ride . " Alice looks at her . " My car 's at the office , " she says . " On Mapes Avenue . If you can take me there ... " " Oh sure , " Jennifer says , and grins like a kid with a lollipop . She does n't get back to her house on the mainland until almost four that afternoon . She has extracted from Jennifer the promise that she will call the police , but she is eager to call them herself as well . She knows all about claims . She has filed enough insurance claims since Eddie drowned . North Oleander Street resembles a jungle through which a narrow asphalt road has been laid and left to deteriorate . A sign at the street 's opening reads dead end , appropriate in that North Oleander runs for two blocks before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself in the opposite direction . Lining these two short blocks are twelve shingled houses with the sort of glass-louvered windows you could find all over Cape October in the good old days before it became a tourist destination for folks from the Middle West and Canada . The houses here are virtually hidden from view by a dense growth of dusty cabbage palm and palmetto , red bougainvillea , purple bougainvillea , white bougainvillea growing in dense profusion , sloppy pepper trees , pink oleander , golden allamanda , trailing lavender lantana , rust-colored shrimp plants , yellow hibiscus , pink hibiscus , red hibiscus , eponymous bottlebrush trees with long red flowers  --  and here and there , the one true floral splendor of Cape October , the bird-of-paradise with its spectacular orange and bluish-purple crest . Rosie Garrity greets her at the front door . Round-faced and stout , in her fifties , wearing a flowered housedress and a white blouse , she glances down at Alice 's foot , shakes her head , and says , " What happened to you ? " " I got run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " The ankle , yes . Where are the kids ? " " I thought maybe you 'd picked them up . " " What do you mean ? " " They were n't on the bus . " " Oh dear , " Alice says . " Was there a mix-up again ? " She limps into the kitchen , takes the phone from its wall bracket over the pass-through counter , and dials the school 's number by heart . Someone in the administrative office picks up on the third ring . " Pratt Elementary , " she says . Unless a kid is lucky enough to get into Cape October 's exclusive public elementary school " for the gifted , " officially called Pratt by the school board but snidely referred to as " Brat " by the parents of children who have not passed the stringent entrance exams ; or unless a kid is rich enough to afford one of the area 's two private preparatory schools  --  St. Mark 's in Cape October itself , and the Headley Academy in nearby Manakawa  --  then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the selection is further limited by that part of the city in which the student happens to live . Jamie has not spoken a word since his father drowned , but he and Ashley are bright as hell , and after the family moved down here both kids passed Pratt 's entrance exams with ease . " Hi , " Alice says , " this is Mrs. Glendenning . Did my kids get on the wrong bus again ? " " Oh golly , I hope not . Which bus were they supposed to be on ? " " Harry Nelson 's . " " Let me see if I can reach him . " There is a silence on the line . Rosie raises an inquisitive eyebrow . Alice shrugs . She waits . The voice comes back on the line again . " Mrs. Glendenning ? " " Yes ? " " Harry says they did n't board his bus . He thought you might 've picked them up . " " No , I did n't . Can you find out which bus they did board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of the other drivers . I got lucky with Harry . " " Last time , they called me from Becky Feldman 's house . They got off there when they realized they were on the wrong bus . Would you know which route that might be ? " " I can check . Why do n't you call the Feldmans meanwhile ? I 'll get back to you . " " Thanks , " Alice says , and puts the phone back on its hook , and then opens the Cape October directory and looks under the F 's for Feldman . She thinks Becky 's father 's name is Stephen , yes , there it is , Stephen Feldman on Adler Road . She dials the number , and waits while it rings once , twice , three times ... " Hello ? " " Susan ? " She can hear children 's voices in the background . " Yes ? " " Hi , this is Alice Glendenning . " " Oh , hi , how are you ? " " I do n't suppose my kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they 're not , " Susan says . " Did you misplace them again ? " " It would seem so . I do n't suppose I could talk to Becky , could I ? " " Just a second . " She hears Susan calling her daughter to the phone , hears Becky approaching , hears her picking up the receiver . " Hello ? " " Hi , Becky , this is Ashley 's mom . " " Oh , hi , Mrs. Glendenning . " " Did you happen to see Ashley and Jamie after school today ? " " No , I di n't , " Becky says . " Getting on one of the buses maybe ? " " No , I di n't . " " Okay , thanks a lot . " " Did you want to talk to my mom again ? " " No , that 's okay , thanks , Becky , just tell her bye . " " Okay , " Becky says , and hangs up .

" " I do n't know anybody with a blue car , " Alice says . " What is it ? " Rosie asks . " Is he still there ? The guard . Luke Whoever . " " Farraday . No , ma'am . I reached him at home . " " Well , I ... can you let me have his number , please ? " She listens as Phoebe reads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the counter . " Thank you , " she says . She puts the phone back on its cradle , hesitates for a single uncertain instant ... " What is it ? " Rosie asks again . ... and is reaching for the phone again when it rings , startling her . She picks up the receiver . " Hello ? " she says . A woman 's voice says , " I have your children . Do n't call the police , or they 'll die . " There is a click on the line . Alice puts the receiver back on the cradle . Her hand is trembling . Her face has gone pale . " What is it ? " Rosie asks . " Someone has the children . " " Oh my God !

Tell them a black woman in her thirties has your kids . Do it now , Mrs. Glendenning . A bad situation can only get worse . Trust me on that . " " I ca n't take that chance , Rosie . " " You ca n't take any other chance . " The women look at each other . " Call them , " Rosie says . " No , " Alice says . " Then God have mercy on your soul , " Rosie says . Alone in the house now , Rosie gone in a flutter of dire predictions , Alice first begins blaming herself . I should have bought Ashley the cell phone , she thinks , and remembers her daughter arguing like an attorney for the defense . " But , Mom , all the girls in the fifth grade have cell phones ! " Oh , sure , the same way all the girls in the fifth grade are allowed to wear lipstick and all the girls in the fifth grade are allowed to date , and ... " No , Ashley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cell phone just now . " " But , Mom ... " " Not just now , darling , I 'm sorry . " Thinking now , I should have bought her the phone , how much would it have cost , anyway ? If Ashley had a cell phone , she 'd have called me at the office before getting in a car with a strange woman  --  what on earth possessed her ? How many times had Alice told them , her and Jamie both , never to accept anything from a stranger , never , not candy , not anything , never even to stop and talk with a stranger , certainly never to get in a car with a stranger , what was wrong with them ? No , she thinks , it is n't their fault , it is n't my fault , it 's this woman 's fault , whoever she is , this woman driving a blue car , do I know anyone who drives a blue car ? She tries to remember . She 's sure she must know someone who drives a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's car unless it 's yellow or pink ? A blue car , she thinks , a blue car , come on , who drives a blue car , but she ca n't think of a single soul , and her frustration leads once again to unreasoning anger . Anger against herself for not having bought the goddamn cell phone , anger at her children for getting into a car with a strange woman , but especially anger at this undoubtedly crazed person , whoever she is , this woman who probably has no children of her own , and who has now stolen from Alice the only precious things in her life , I 'll kill her , she thinks . If ever I get my hands on her  - -  The phone rings . Alice picks up the receiver at once . " Hello ? " she says . " Mrs. Glendenning ? " The same woman again . " Yes , " Alice says . " Listen , Miss  --  " " No , you listen , " the woman says . " Do n't interrupt , just listen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hundred-dollar bills . Get the money together by noon tomorrow . We 'll call again then . Get the money . Or the kiddies die . " And she hangs up . Alice puts the receiver back on the wall hook , and stands silently at the kitchen counter for what is perhaps thirty seconds . Then she reaches for the phone again , and immediately calls Charlie Hobbs . Continues ...
