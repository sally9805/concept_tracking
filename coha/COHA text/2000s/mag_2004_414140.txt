She immediately called the real estate agent and sat in the driveway until the agent arrived . They walked through the home , and the rest is history . The stone house , built in 1927 , resembles a small castle , so JoAnna and her husband , Gary , decided to surround it with an English-style garden . While Gary immediately started updating the interiors , JoAnna kept her eye on the front yard . She looked through books and magazines for ideas that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Plants After about a year of living in the house , the family gathered to start landscaping . Gary and sons Jonathan and Brandon laid flagstone , building a neat little terrace in front of the house . They also planted a hedge of boxwoods to screen the new patio from the road . The whole garden began to revolve around the terrace . JoAnna consulted garden designer Charlotte Rose , who suggested using lots of colorful flowers and foliage . JoAnna bought the plants and set the pots out in the beds , looking at each one for a while to make sure it was in just the right spot before planting it . Today , the small beds are full of showy flowers , but foliage plants are key to the garden 's success . Plants with unusual leaves , such as lamb 's ears , cannas , coleus , hostas , and ferns , add texture and form . They hold the garden together when the flowers fade . Blooming perennials such as summer phlox ( Phlox paniculata ) , black-eyed Susans , lilies , and coneflowers also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sedum from her mother 's yard and iris and daylilies from her grandmother 's garden form tidy clumps around the terrace . Daughters Michelle and Elizabeth share plant-maintenance duties , often assisting JoAnna in planting , watering , and weeding . They like to learn plant names and pick the blooms . The family always displays fresh bouquets in their home and gives cut flowers to neighbors . Salvaged With Style Gary loves building and likes using salvaged items to personalize his work . He designed and constructed the unique bench that is pictured below . Old English corbels , originally used as decorative supports , serve as the two large wooden end pieces . These detailed architectural elements look like two giant bookends . A bolted metal seat and backrest span the corbels . Gary also converted a large circular planter and three finials into a fine-looking water feature . He sealed the inside of the planter , making it watertight , and hired a local stone company to drill holes in the three stone finials . Plumbed to a small pump , the finials bubble water from their tops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the winter , when many plants go dormant , this fountain becomes a focal point .

She adapted the piece as a planter , filling it with colorful flowers . Far from looking out of place , these salvaged items fit in nicely , giving the landscape personality and charm . A Garden Everyone Can Appreciate People walking down the street stand on tiptoe as they pass by , trying to look over the boxwood hedge and see what 's in bloom . Neighborhood friends on walks often stop and stay awhile . Such unexpected visits turn into fun gatherings on the small terrace . The Sasnetts ' team effort has created a wonderful outdoor room that everyone admires @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JoAnna spend lots of time , quality time , with their four children in the garden . The boys are in charge of keeping the fountain clean and sweeping the terrace and walkways . The girls love to plant and pick flowers . They also like to learn about the many plants . JoAnna sometimes hides little treasures in the garden for the children to find . <p>
