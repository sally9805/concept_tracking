<p> Not long ago , Hyundai was a joke , a car so cheap and unreliable that people compared it to that ultimate lemon , the Yugo , and David Letterman cracked wise about it in his Top 10 lists . <p> No one 's laughing now . <p> With an unprecedented 10-year warranty , sleek new designs and a growing reputation for value , the Korean cars are among the hottest things on four wheels . Sales have soared 315 percent since 1998 , and Hyundai sold a record 375,119 cars in the United States last year , making it the fourth best-selling import in the country . Its Santa Fe sport utility vehicle and Sonata sedan rank first in customer satisfaction , according to J.D. Power and Associates . Other industry surveys have found that young adults think Hyundai is " hipper " than Honda and Toyota . <p> Buoyed by success and convinced his cars offer unsurpassed value , Hyundai Motor America Chief Executive Officer Finbarr O'Neill recently announced an ambitious plan to sell 1 million cars a year in the United States by 2010 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this year . <p> To help reach that goal , Hyundai opened a $25 million design studio in Irvine last week and , following the lead of Japan 's Honda , Nissan and Toyota , is building a $1 billion factory in the United States . This one will be in Montgomery , Ala . Concentrating the company 's design and construction facilities there , company officials said , will allow it to tailor its cars to American tastes and build them quickly . <p> Few industry analysts think Hyundai can reach its lofty U.S. sales goal , but the fact they took it seriously at all shows how far Hyundai has come since O'Neill took over in 1998 . <p> " It 's a very remarkable turnaround , " said Jeff Schuster , an industry analyst with J.D. Power &; Associates . " You do n't have to go back too far to see a brand that almost had to ( leave ) the market . " <p> Hyundai 's resurgence stands in stark contrast to its fellow Korean auto manufacturers : Kia , which is faltering , and Daewoo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company went bankrupt in 2000 , leaving thousands of perplexed owners in the lurch . <p> The success of Hyundai also mirrors the trajectory of Honda and Toyota , both of which stumbled when they first began selling in the United States three decades ago but regrouped , revamped and now dominate the market . <p> " Hyundai is trying a similar approach , but working much more quickly than the Japanese did , " Schuster said . " Not only are they taking market share from the Big Three ( General Motors , Ford and DaimlerChrysler ) , they 're taking share from the Japanese as well . They 've got everyone looking over their shoulder . " <p> Hyundai came to the United States in 1986 with the Excel , a boxy compact that was priced at $4,000 . The idea was to offer new cars at used-car prices . But the cars were unreliable and so poorly built that some owners called them " High and Dry "  --  because that 's where they 'd leave you . <p> Rather than surrender , Hyundai switched gears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices . But by 1998 , Hyundai was in dire straits . Although quality had improved markedly , its cars remained saddled with a reputation for unreliability , and few wanted them . Hyundai sold a paltry 90,217 cars that year  --  about what Honda sells in a month . <p> Things were so bad that Hyundai could n't find anyone willing to take command of the company . Desperate , the board of directors chose O'Neill , who until then had been Hyundai 's corporate attorney in California and had no experience running a car company . <p> O'Neill was traveling and was not available for comment , but in a recent Newsweek profile , he admitted he was leery of the job . <p> " We were a company looking over the precipice , " he said . " I kept my law license intact as an insurance policy . " <p> O'Neill 's first step was to prove that Hyundai built solid cars . In a huge gamble that ultimately paid off , Hyundai offered what it calls America 's Best Warranty  --  an unprecedented six-year bumper-to-bumper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warranty , Hyundai established credibility and showed consumers they would stand behind their products , their cars were screwed together well , and people could trust them , " said George Peterson , president of AutoPacific , an auto industry consulting firm . <p> The warranty began drawing more people into Hyundai showrooms , but the cars were still tough to sell . O'Neill knew he had to make them more fashionable , so he ditched the boxy , utilitarian look for smooth , flowing lines . As sales rose , he used the profit to develop better cars with long lists of standard features that include leather interiors , CD players and other amenities . <p> That tactic earned Hyundai a reputation for outstanding value . A fully loaded 2003 Hyundai Sonata with a V-6 engine , 5-speed transmission and leather interior is priced at $19,099 . A similarly equipped Honda Accord is priced at $25,173 . <p> " Quite honestly , it was the value that sold me , " said Sean Stevenson , a software salesman from Pacifica who bought a Sonata three years ago . " If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camrys and the ( Nissan ) Maximas , they 're about $3,000 more and there 's only a few areas where they 're better than the Sonata . " <p> The tactics have paid off . Hyundai has seen sales climb by about 85,000 cars annually since 1998 . Its share of the American market now equals Volkswagen 's . <p> " We sell a ton of them , " said Michael Lopretta , manager of Doten Hyundai in Richmond . " I outsell ( Doten 's ) Toyota and Honda stores consistently . We ended up selling almost 1,200 cars last year and beat Hyundai 's projection by almost 400 percent . " <p> Quality has jumped by equally impressive margins . Hyundai rates as the most improved car line in J.D. Power 's quality survey . <p> " Between our 1998 and 2002 surveys , Hyundai improved by 42 percent , " said Brian Walters , director of product research for J.D. Power . The survey examines 135 factors , from squeaks and rattles to engine problems to faulty controls . " The average vehicle improved by 24 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Santa Fe and Sonata top marks , and Motor Trend and other magazines have heaped praise upon the Tiburon , Hyundai 's sports coupe . <p> Hyundai 's premium sedan is the XG350 , and the company may add a minivan and a larger SUV to the lineup . <p> Analysts said Hyundai will need to expand its product range if it hopes to meet O'Neill 's goal of selling 1 million cars a year by 2010 . Company officials agree . <p> " We do realize this is a rather aggressive plan , " said Robert Cosmai , vice president of national sales . " However , we feel that the 1 million unit sales target by 2010 can be achieved by increasing our volume with existing products , as well as introducing new product lines . " <p> But others doubt Hyundai will move that many cars . Toyota sold more Camrys last year than Hyundai sold cars , and boosting annual sales from 375,119 to 1 million in seven years will require grabbing a huge chunk of the market from Honda , Toyota and other far larger companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to come out of someone else 's hide , and no one 's going to give that up , " said Csaba Csere , editor of Car &; Driver magazine . " Everyone wants to gain market share , but no one expects it to increase very much in the next couple of years . " <p> But even those who doubt Hyundai can reach that goal say that if anyone can lead the company there , it 's O'Neill . He has been widely praised for his leadership of a company that was all but dead when he took over . <p> " We used to be the brand of last resort , " company spokesman Mike Anson said . " We are n't anymore . People know Honda , they know Toyota and now they know Hyundai . There 's a little bit of buzz . We 're making progress . We 're climbing the stairs one step at a time .
