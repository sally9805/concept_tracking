Section : Nation &; World Why Israelis eye a potentially nuclear-armed Iran and worry that a cataclysm ca n't be averted <p> TEL AVIV-There was a time-from the September 1993 start of the peace process with the Palestinians until the sudden , explosive outbreak of the intifada in September 2000-when Israelis might have been able to remain steady in the face of the nuclear threat now looming in Iran . Back then , Israelis dared to hope that they were finally on their way to peace with their enemies-first Egypt , then the Palestinians and Jordan , soon Syria , and then all of Israel 's borders would finally be secure . The old wars would be over , and a " new Middle East " would be at hand . Iran , even if it were as close to going nuclear as it is today , probably would n't have had most Israelis convinced , as they are now , that they face a second Holocaust unless somebody-preferably the Americans , but if not , then Israel itself-pre-emptively bombs into rubble Iran 's nuclear facilities . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that Iran 's Islamist revolutionaries would n't be so self-destructive as to risk the lives of their country 's 69 million people , not to mention their own lives , by launching a nuclear strike against a far stronger adversary . Israel , after all , has been building its nuclear arsenal , a defensive insurance policy , for some 40 years . Israelis might also have drawn reassurance from the fact that Iran , after all , had n't dared strike them with the chemical and possibly biological weapons already in its possession . If Israelis were in a less grim and fatalistic mood then than they 're in now , the threat of Iranian retaliation with weapons of mass destruction might have convinced most that a pre-emptive strike on Iran 's nuclear facilities just was n't worth the risk . <p> But today a growing numbers of Israelis are feeling the way they felt in the bad old days , before their leaders began shaking hands with the enemy : that in their corner of the world , it 's either kill or be killed . Israelis figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended up with suicide bombings and Hamas . They unilaterally ended the occupation of Gaza-and the rocketing of Israeli border towns only escalated . They got out of Lebanon and , after six quiet years , Hezbollah showered the Galilee for a month last summer with 4,000 of the rockets it stockpiled with Iran 's generous assistance . <p> As a result , Israelis have run out of faith that their enemies can be persuaded to let them be in peace . The 5.3 million Jews in Israel , which was founded in the shadow of the Nazis ' extermination of 6 million European Jews only three generations ago , have reverted in large part to their core identity-that of a historically persecuted people whose enemies , now as before , are bent on their destruction , and whose only way to survive is by being stronger than those enemies . Living with the daily escalation of the fighting in Gaza , and with the virtual certainty that a second round of fighting with Hezbollah is n't too far off , Israelis look to the horizon 600 miles east and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : an enemy who not only swears to destroy them but who may soon be capable of trying to do so . <p> Time running out . Israeli leaders have been warning the world for decades about Iran , and the issue will be first among Prime Minister Ehud Olmert 's talking points at his meeting next week at the White House with President Bush , who , of course , needs no warnings on the subject . Olmert comes to Washington on the heels of his unsuccessful attempt in Moscow to persuade President Vladimir Putin to take a tougher line on Iran . <p> For Olmert , like most of Israel 's political leadership , there is growing anxiety that time is running out for a diplomatic fix . Iran is brazenly defying U.N . Security Council demands to suspend its uranium enrichment program-a key step toward bomb making-and the imposition of punitive international sanctions must get a nod from reluctant Russia and China . " The Iranians need to fear that something that they do not want to happen to them will happen to them , " Olmert said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Returning to Israel , he sounded a theme that is central to Israel 's view of Iran : the comparison of that country to Nazi Germany , and of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to Hitler . " We shall never repeat the mistakes of 60 years ago , " Olmert said , " of burying our heads in the sand , ignoring what was being heard then when it was still possible to save lives . " <p> Israelis have been likening their archenemies to Hitler since the days of Haj Amin el-Husseini , the Palestinian leader in the 1948 war . Husseini , however , gave credibility to the analogy with his avid public support for the Nazis in World War II . Similarly , Ahmadinejad invited the comparison to Hitler with his remark that the Holocaust was a " myth , " his hosting of a cartoon exhibition in Tehran that mocked Jewish sensitivities about the Nazi genocide , and his call for Israel to be " wiped off the map . " <p> Between the natural fears of the Israeli public , the often-fiery rhetoric of Israeli politicians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the national stress level over Iran keeps climbing . So far , Iran has reported progress with uranium enrichment , though only to a low level suitable for fueling a nuclear power reactor . Producing bomb-grade , highly enriched uranium remains a major hurdle , as does creating a workable bomb that could be engineered into a missile warhead . <p> A key question now is how much time is left . Israeli intelligence has predicted that Iran could be able to make a nuclear bomb by 2008 , though American intelligence estimates put the probable date closer to 2015 . That gap in time is the difference between whether Iran constitutes a crisis or still just a problem . Iran claims it is only interested in developing civilian nuclear power . <p> Dread . Yet the deepening dread that Iran is preparing a death blow for Israel , and the hardening conviction that Israel may have no choice but to strike first , are reminiscent of the agonizing , two-week " waiting period " that preceded Israel 's pre-emptive aerial assault on the Egyptian Air Force that launched , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this current crisis decided-and that desire will eventually draw a hard line beyond which efforts for a diplomatic resolution may be moot . <p> Most Israelis simply do n't believe that diplomacy-and specifically , pressure through proposed U.N . Security Council sanctions-will stop Iran from developing nuclear weapons . Israeli leaders , naturally , would much prefer that the United States use its greatly superior military resources to take out Iran 's far-flung , heavily protected nuclear facilities , but if America passes on the mission , some 60 percent of Israelis , according to a recent survey , want their own armed forces to do the job . " I hope the world will deal with this , " said Iris Hasid , 39 , shopping in the mall at Israel 's ground zero-the 50-story Azrieli twin towers across the street from Israeli military headquarters in the heart of Tel Aviv . But when asked what Israel should do if the world does n't deal with Iran 's incipient nuclear power , Hasid , a healthcare administrator , replied without hesitation : " Go to war . " The risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't alter her view . " Israel has those weapons , too . I 'm confident Israel is capable of defending itself . And , " she said , smiling and pointing heavenward , " God will help . " <p> Yet Israelis worry that Iran 's leaders believe that God will help them , and that God , in the Iranians ' understanding , has commanded them to destroy the " Zionist infidels . " A basic belief in Israel ( and elsewhere ) is that religious-based political radicals are more dangerous than the secular brand because they are incapable of changing or moderating their views , which they believe to be God 's word . So the Cold War-era deterrence concept of mutually assured destruction-a nuclear balance of terror that worked for the United States against the Soviet Union and China-does n't ease many Israeli worries . Joseph Stalin 's Soviet Union and Mao Zedong 's China " were crazy regimes , but this crazy regime is crazier . Its ideology is jihad , " said Labor Knesset member and former Mossad chief Danny Yatom , who added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets nuclear weapons , it will use them against the Jewish state . <p> Given Israelis ' apocalyptic fears , would their leaders , as a last resort , order an attack on Iran 's nuclear facilities ? The Israeli Air Force had stunning success with its 1981 bombing of Iraq 's Osirak nuclear reactor , setting back Saddam Hussein 's nuclear program . Yet it is clearly understood today that wiping out Iran 's nuclear works , which are numerous , spread out , and often hidden deep underground , is a challenge of a whole different magnitude and may , in fact , be impossible . Iraq , preoccupied at the time with its war of attrition with Iran , did n't retaliate against Israel , but Israelis ca n't count on such good fortune if they strike at Iraq 's former adversary . <p> But when so many Israelis see an Iranian nuclear attack as inevitable-unless the United States strikes Iran first-any risk may seem worth taking . Yatom acknowledged that Israel would " have to be ready for the possibility that Iran would use its chemical weapons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to shove , the ex-Mossad leader would still favor a pre-emptive strike ; otherwise , he said , " there will be a nuclear attack against Israel , which is much more dangerous . " <p> To attack Iran , however , Israel would first need a green light from Washington , and at the moment , that is hard to imagine . The United States has vastly superior military resources , and its homeland , unlike Israel , is out of Iranian missile range . Thus , if the United States decided to pass on the mission , there seems no reason why it would want Israel to handle the job-especially when Iran and its allies would inevitably see the " great Satan " behind Israel 's " little Satan . " <p> Israel 's day of decision-the day its leaders become convinced the Iranian threat is untenable-could be anywhere from a year to several years away . For Israelis , this will very likely be a time of mounting tension , of dark memories resurfacing , of survival instincts taking over . " For us , " Olmert said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he wants to destroy us , it does not sound like an empty declaration but something we must prepare to prevent through all acceptable and possible ways . " Much of Jewish history , and of Israeli identity , is contained in that message . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Authorities fuel the anti-Israel mood in Iran with organized demonstrations . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Israeli Prime Minster Olmert pressed Russia 's Putin for a tougher line on Iran . <p> By Larry Derfner <p>
