Berry Knudsen eased her battered army surplus Jeep over to the curb , pulled the emergency brake on , and studied the only mailbox in the deserted cul-de-sac . No name . No street number . Terrific . She squinted into the blackness and reread the address taped to the large pizza box on the seat next to her . 5077 Ellenburg Drive . This had to be it . This was Ellenburg Drive , and this was the only house for a quarter of a mile . She thunked her forehead onto the steering wheel and groaned . Last delivery of the night , and it had all the earmarks of a prank . <p> The house was a three-story Victorian perched on a small hillock . A sliver of moon ducked behind the clouds throwing ghostly highlights over the house , and a chill March wind moaned through a giant oak standing guard over the lawn on the south side . Berry grimaced and decided Jack the Ripper would have felt comfy here . Quasimodo could have added a bell tower and been happy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traded half the blood in Transylvania for a house like this . But it 's not in Transylvania , Berry reminded herself . It 's in suburban Seattle and probably belongs to some nice little old lady and her nephew ... Norman Bates . <p> She grimly noted that there was n't a light shining anywhere . No car in the driveway . No sign of life that might require a large pizza with the works . Damn . She really should go up and ring the doorbell . How bad could the thing lurking behind the ornate , hand-carved front door be ? Probably just some hungry pervert , sitting in the dark in his boxers , waiting for the pizza delivery lady . <p> Berry pushed her short blond curls behind her ear . She was being ridiculous . How did she come up with these ideas ? Mr. Large Pizza with the Works simply was n't home . He probably went out for a six-pack of beer and maybe a hatchet . Happened all the time . And since he was n't home , there certainly was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doorbell . What she should do was get her keister the heck out of this creepy cul-de-sac . <p> A cat cried in the distance , and the hairs on Berry 's neck stood on end . Beads of sweat popped out on her upper lip . She held the steering wheel in a death grip , and the pathetic little meow , filled with fear and wavering uncertainty , echoed through the still air again . Berry closed her eyes and slumped in her seat . It was worse than a cat . It was the cry of a kitten . She was doomed . She was a sucker for lost dogs , fallen nestlings , and stranded kittens . It called out again into the darkness , and Berry grabbed the pizza box and set off across the lawn , drawing courage from the fact that the Victorian house looked less sinister at close range . It had been freshly painted lemon yellow . The intricate gingerbread trim sported a new coat of white . The windows were curtainless , but the panes reflected a recent cleaning . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and swished its tail . <p> " Kitty , kitty , kitty , " Berry called softly . <p> Meow . <p> Berry bit her lower lip . The dumb cat was stuck in the tree . A blast of wind ruffled the kitten 's fur , causing the little ball of fluff to huddle closer to the limb . Berry rolled her eyes and plunked the pizza box on the ground beside the tree . <p> " Do n't get me wrong , " Berry explained to the cat as she scrambled to shinny up the tree . " It 's not that I do n't like kittens . And it is n't that I mind climbing trees . It 's just that I 've about filled my good deed quota this week . " She grasped at the lowest limb and hauled herself up in perfect tomboy fashion . " Do you know what I did this week , kitty ? I advertised for a delivery boy , and then I hired three little old ladies instead . Now they 're doing the baking , and I 'm doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not a delivery sort of person . I get lost a lot , and I 'm not too brave about knocking on strange doors . And if that is n't bad enough , I moved the old ladies into my apartment . " <p> The kitten looked at her and blinked . <p> Berry sighed in exasperation . " Well , what could I do ? They were living in the train station . " <p> Berry wriggled next to the kitten and looked up toward the stars . It was nice in the tree . The wind whistled through the limbs and whipped her short hair around her face . <p> " People should sit in trees more often , " she said to the cat . " It 's peaceful and exciting , all at the same time . And you can see forever . Practically clear down to the little bridge at the lower end of Ellenburg Drive . " <p> She watched in quiet fascination as headlights smoothly moved over the bridge and snaked uphill toward her . The soft rumble of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she breathed , suddenly aware of her predicament . " Large Pizza with the Works is coming home , and I 'm sitting in his tree ! " <p> A Great Gatsby-type car purred up the driveway . It was a large , cream-colored machine with a brown leather convertible top , spoked wheels , and running boards . The garage doors automatically opened , swallowed up the antique car , and closed with a neat click , plunging Berry and the cat back into quiet darkness . <p> Berry exhaled a low whistle . " Impressive , " she remarked to the cat . " What was that ? A Stutz Bearcat ? Or maybe a Stanley Steamer ? Definitely something old and flashy , and perfectly restored . I 'll say this for Quasi , he has style and money . I bet he 's some eccentric gangster . Some drug runner who 's watched too many old movies . " <p> Berry imagined him as looking like Quasimodo in a panama hat . The white pizza box on the ground caught her attention . She should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home now and might be hungry . After all , she did take pride in her job . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
