Guess who is now going to make a killing from the Internet ? The lawyers . Here 's the shocking part : What took them so long ? <P> As Internet start-ups draw the best and brightest  --  or at least the greediest  --  away from myriad industries , off-line firms ranging from investment banking to media have been forced to increase compensation to keep pace . The latest manifestation of the new wage order is in the legal profession , where promising young attorneys have been abandoning their law firms for Internet start-ups . <P> To keep legal eagles hungry , law firms are taking some of the money that goes to partners  --  who typically earn a seven-figure " draw "  --  and redirect it to associates , who do much of the grunt work at Silicon Valley practices like Gunderson Dettmer and blue-chip New York firms like Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher &; Flom . First-year compensation packages will top $140,000 , up from under $100,000 just three years ago . The higher wages are designed to ward off dotcoms seeking to hire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm . " The legal industry is unique in that corporations have the option of bringing legal services inhouse or outsourcing them to a law firm , " says Robert Major , partner at Major , Hagen and Africa , a San Francisco firm . So law firms are bidding against their own clients for their own attorneys . <P> Increasingly , the firms are demanding equity stakes in client companies  --  equity that can be distributed throughout the firm . But there is one advantage to the salaries the law firms are offering : it 's all in cash . Or , as Major likes to tell his junior associates , " You ca n't pay your mortgage in stock options .
