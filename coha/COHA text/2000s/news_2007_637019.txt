<p> More than 50 years after streetcars vanished from Atlanta , a group of business and civic leaders have a $1 billion , 20-year plan to bring them back along a dramatically revitalized Peachtree Street corridor . <p> Unveiled Tuesday , the recommendation envisions an overhaul of the city 's signature thoroughfare to include new sidewalks and bicycle lanes , improved lighting and landscaping , buried utility lines and a string of small parks and plazas , about one every quarter-mile . The plan , which is being fine-tuned , would be financed in part with new taxes on property owners along the street . <p> The plan faces considerable political hurdles , but its supporters believe the proposal is far from fanciful . <p> Tom Bell , who co-chaired the Peachtree Corridor Task Force , said he began the process thinking it would produce a vision . " Now I believe that a large portion of this can get done , " said Bell , chief executive officer of Cousins Properties , one of the city 's largest and most influential developers . <p> The group was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a world-class corridor along the lines of Michigan Avenue in Chicago . <p> Bell said final recommendations will be given to the mayor by March 26 . <p> After a year of work , the group on Tuesday released details of their plan , including answers to some of the thorniest questions they faced  --  how to pay for the project and how to squeeze streetcars onto the traffic-clogged corridor . <p> About half of the $1 billion price tag would come from a special taxing district that would encompass the entire Peachtree corridor , a change that would require City Council approval , Bell said . <p> Every property owner , both residential and commercial , would pay an additional tax each year based on the value of their home or business . The amount has yet to be determined , but Bell said the owner of a $300,000 condo might be expected to pay an additional $250 a year . <p> The remaining money would come from a variety of sources , including city , state and federal governments , a dedicated parking tax , and from private @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two streetcar lines that would cost up to $450 million . The longest , a 15-mile stretch from Brookhaven in the north to the Fort McPherson area in the south , would cut through Buckhead , Midtown , downtown and the emerging Castleberry Hill district . <p> A separate four-mile line would circulate in the downtown area among hotels and tourist attractions , from the Georgia Aquarium to the Martin Luther King Jr . Historic District . <p> It 's unclear whether MARTA or some other entity would build and operate the streetcar system . <p> The proposal calls for streetcars to roll with other traffic along the 19-mile route . To keep traffic moving , Peachtree may need to be widened at certain points to accommodate medians , turn lanes and wider sidewalks , officials said . <p> Stations would be spaced about a quarter-mile apart , and several connections are planned with the proposed Beltline rail line . <p> In addition , the Peachtree name , which now changes to Whitehall Street in downtown Atlanta , would extend south all the way to Fort McPherson  --  bringing the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other improvements  --  to an area of town long in the shadows of the northside . <p> Assuming the city approves the plan and other funding is secured , Bell said work could start building the streetcar 's first leg in downtown and Midtown in two years . <p> ' What are we waiting on ? ' <p> Steve Cover , commissioner of planning and development for the city of Atlanta , said the task force has come up with a solid plan . <p> " Eventually , when this report is presented to us , I think it will be something the city can definitely run with , " said Cover , who serves on the task force . <p> Atlanta City Council President Lisa Borders , said Tuesday that she had not heard about the special tax district aspect of the proposal , but she said the council would be " open to looking at all ideas that would benefit the city , and any financing vehicle that would help with transportation options would be of interest . " <p> City Council member Kwanza Hall , who represents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support the plan , envisioning the Peachtree streetcar as the initial piece of a comprehensive streetcar network . <p> " What are we waiting on ? " said Hall . " We need innovative transportation solutions immediately . " <p> Franklin could not be reached for comment . <p> The idea of resurrecting streetcars in Atlanta can be traced to a 2002 speech noted urban planner Andres Duany gave to the Midtown Alliance . The concept was picked up by several business leaders led by Michael Robison , owner of Lanier Parking . <p> After two years of study , the group handed the project off to the mayor . <p> Tax could be tough sell <p> One of the more controversial aspects of the proposal could be the addition of a special tax district . Three communities  --  downtown , Midtown and Buckhead  --  already have established community improvement districts ( CIDs ) where commercial property owners tax themselves to enhance the area . <p> " There would be some serious questions about double taxation , " said Scotty Greene , president of the Buckhead CID who also serves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a challenge for Atlanta leaders for the next two elected terms to articulate the opportunities in the future . " <p> Susan Mendheim , president of the Midtown Alliance who also serves on the task force , said her organization would have to look over the proposal . But she stressed that " we are enthusiastic about the goal . " <p> The draft recommendation envisions the project 's being built in three phases , starting in the downtown and Midtown areas . <p> The second phase would be in Buckhead , and the latter phase would be in the area south of downtown . <p> That phasing is fine with Atlanta developer Egbert Perry , co-chair of the task force , who sees the extension of Peachtree Street to the south side as a way to reshape the underdeveloped part of town . <p> " This is an opportunity to knit the city back along the spine , " said Perry , who is CEO of the Integral Group . <p> ROAD TO THE FUTURE <p> A group of business and civic leaders are fine-tuning a $1 billion recommendation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and other improvements . <p> How would the money be spent ? <p> Streetcar lines ... $450 million <p> Land / right of way ... $160 million <p> Streetcapes ... $100 million <p> Burying utility lines ... $75 million <p> Parks / green space ... $70 million <p> Road improvements ... $70 million <p> Where would the money come from ? <p> Special tax district ... $450-$650 million <p> Southside tax allocation district ... $100-$150 million <p> Federal grants ... $100-$150 million <p> Parking tax ... $50 million <p> City of Atlanta ... $25 million-$50 million <p> Private donations ... $15 million-$20 million <p> Source : Peachtree Corridor Task Force Map : StaffPEACHTREE MAKEOVERMap shows proposed Peachtree corridor .
