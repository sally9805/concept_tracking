Remember when Congress abandoned the 55-m.p.h. speed limit a few years ago ? That may have helped pave the way for this wave of fatal blowouts . <P> Back in the 1970s , when the 55-m.p.h. speed limit was established , U.S. tiremakers were introducing steel-belted radials  --  now standard on most American cars , including the Ford Explorers . Even in the ' 70s the fatal consequences of tread separation were well known . And so were a number of remedies , including the use of nylon caps that form a tourniquet around the belts and rubber to hold them together . Nylon caps are widespread in Europe and other parts of the world , but with U.S. speed limits set low , most experts believed they were n't necessary in America . <P> In the mid- ' 90s , when Congress allowed the speed limit to go back up , the stress on tires rose dramatically . Even so , manufacturers insisted that nylon caps produced a more rigid tire with a rougher ride and argued that except for tires subjected to speeds of 110 m.p.h. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hence most major-brand tires used in the U.S. today lack nylon caps . <P> But did the manufacturers know the risks of not using the caps ? A series of tests were carried out in 1997 , 1998 and 1999 by Standard Testing Laboratories , which performs numerous tests for the industry . One popped up in a California trial that ended in June with a jury 's awarding $15 million to a man who demonstrated that the tread of his Dunlop tire had collapsed in part because the company did not design a nylon cap into the tire . He is now a quadriplegic ; the case is on appeal . According to plaintiffs ' lawyers and experts , the STL studies document on video what happens to major-brand-name radials as their inflation is reduced : none of the tires suffer fatal tread separation if they have nylon caps . Last week Ford urged Firestone to recall its Wilderness AT tires in Venezuela because they lacked the caps . <P> Firestone engineers advocated the use of nylon caps in the ' 70s to head off the infamous tread-separation scandal on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Firestone 's replacement tires in the U.S. do not have nylon caps , except for a few Bridgestones shipped in from the parent company in Japan . Firestone argues that its tire problems are specific to one factory and not a matter of technology . Bridgestone , however , does sell the nylon cap Dueler for SUVs in the U.S. Like other nylon-fitted tires , they are higher-grade and cost $103 each , compared with just about $70 for a Firestone Wilderness . <P>  --  By Adam Zagorin .
