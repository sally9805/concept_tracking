COMPUTERS Headnote Do n't fret . You can get that lost computer information back . BY CHRISTOPHER ALLBRITTON // IT 'S a nightmare scenario . You 're working away on your computer on a big project that 's due in a few days and your operating system locks up . You try to reboot and the computer wo n't even start . You 've just suffered a catastrophic hard-drive failure , baby . Or-and we 've all done this-you delete some files only to realize you 've thrown out something you need . There are a few options . You can panic . You can use recovery software . Or , you can go to a data recovery specialist . Let 's look at these in order of effectiveness . Panicking is rarely beneficial . Neither is stomping of feet , gnashing of teeth or rending of garments . The second option is to try using data recovery software-one of the most popular is Symantec 's Norton GoBack . These programs let you recover-possibly-your lost data . How ? Because even after you delete something the data is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially a collection of spinning aluminum discs that are coated with one layer each of a substrate , iron oxide and carbon . These three layers are sprayed onto the discs to form a thin covering-as close to 1mm as possible . Then , a Teflon-like covering is applied to the discs . A metallic armature rests over the drive and contains the drive-head , which is a small square of silicon that is magnetoresistive ( meaning the head 's resistance to electricity changes as it comes in contact with a magnetic field ) . The disc surfaces are quickly spinning magnets with various patterns of polarity on them-a moving magnetic field creates an electrical charge . As the polarity changes , the electrical charge in the vicinity of the drive-head changes , allowing it to interpret these changes as 1s and 0s . This is your data . Your hard drive is arranged into sectors . A sector is the smallest physical storage unit on the disc , and is almost always 512 bytes in size . However , most files are larger than 512 bytes . So the file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's data . For example , if a file size is 800 bytes , two 512 sectors are allocated for the file . When you delete a file , the data is n't removed from the drive . Instead , the operating system marks that physical area of the disc as being available for future data while leaving the original data there . Basically , the operating system hides the file so you can no longer get to it . It 's still there , at least until new data is written over it . What data recovery software does is go through your file system , find all the files that have been marked as deleted and offer to recover them . You should save the recovered files to someplace other than your hard drive . Otherwise , you run the risk of overwriting other files you may want to get back . Using software like this is a good solution for the " oops , I threw that away " problem-especially if you catch your mistake quickly . It becomes less effective as more time passes between emptying your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's more of a chance you 've overwritten the files you 're looking for . But what if you 've had a catastrophic drive failure ? And just what is a catastrophic drive failure ? I mentioned that a hard drive is a collection of discs coated with thin layers of substrate and magnetic material . Hovering above the discs is the drivehead on the end of the armature . The discs-spinning at up to 15,000 rpm-create a slight breeze as they spin , which creates a cushion of air for the head . The drivehead never touches the discs-unless something happens to that cushion of air . Then , the head can drop , gouge through the magnetic layers and cut slashes into the surface of the discs . " It can grind through the aluminum substrate and spray dust from all three layers all over the drive , " says Peter Dinhofer of Data Recovery Services in Brooklyn , N.Y . " That is an unrecoverable drive . One piece of dust is what causes this to happen . " Dinhofer and his colleagues are the Federal Emergency Management @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in as a last resort when nothing else works-and they 're not cheap . While Symantec 's software costs $39.95 , Dinhofer 's services start at $250 and go up to $3500 for a single drive . But he 's able to take a drive that is just shy of completely hosed and get some-or even most-of your data back . Data recovery services each have their own techniques , but usually the first step is to get the damaged drive up and running again . The service clones your drive to a blank drive and then works on the cloned drive . As for the damaged parts of the drive , they attempt to work around those portions . Once a damaged drive is cloned to another drive , the service will pick the low-hanging fruit by using data recovery software , either an off-the-shelf variety like Symantec 's or one that is custom-made . If that 's not successful , a recovery specialist will attempt to rebuild the data on the drive by hand by recreating the master boot record ( MBR ) , which among other things tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master file table ( MFT ) , which tells the computer where all the bits of data are on the drive . " I know what MBRs and MFTs look like and I can go in there and find them , correct them and then we can use some form of data recovery tools , " says Dinhofer . But recovery services ca n't work miracles . A drive that has had a massive head crash is usually a lost cause . Moreover , moving large amounts of data around the drive is almost guaranteed to overwrite some files you want to recover . So when you have a drive crash or erase files inadvertently , step back and take a deep breath . Do n't use the computer . Calmly and coolly get a data repairman on the phone or try to remedy the problem yourself by using recovery software . Your data depends on it .
