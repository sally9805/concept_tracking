Chapter One " No kind of sensation is keener and more active than that of pain ; its impressions are unmistakable . " - The Marquis de Sade Nicholas Esperanza thought he was dead . He could n't open his eyes . Could n't move his body . Last thing he remembered was the buxom stripper popping the Ecstasy tab in his mouth while giving him a wild lap dance . The rest was a blur . Fun-filled and crazy , but still a blur . So , maybe he was n't dead after all . Maybe this was simply the worst hangover ever . He concentrated his thoughts and finally managed to sluggishly open his eyes . Bright sunlight gushed through the windows and made his head shriek in pain . He clamped his eyes shut again , for a moment uncertain where the hell he was . Esperanza reached into his pocket , whipped out a pair of Calvin Klein sunglasses and popped them on . Now he could see without his pupils melting . The room steadily came into focus . Oh , okay . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his upstairs office , in his nightclub , Sueo Latino-Latino Dream . On the floor beside him were his gold lighter and matching cigarette case . Esperanza reached out , picked up the case and opened it . Inside were several nicely rolled joints . Hestuffed one into his mouth , sparked it up and toked on it , enjoying the primo weed . Otherwise , Esperanza did n't move . His cobalt-blue Hugo Boss suit was covered in dust and carpet fibers , and wrinkled like an old lady 's ass . A few feet away , there was a mustard-yellow , very comfy , Italian leather couch he could 've crashed on . His brain was pounding as if a crew of gangsta rappers was locked inside , shooting off monster rhymes to a ceaseless , thumping ghetto beat . Coo , I should n't have polished off that bottle of Bacardi last night . He smiled to himself as the memories of the bachelor party he and his boy Havelock attended came flooding back in Technicolor images of champagne drinking , cocaine sniffing , pot smoking , porn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts and all kinds of other debauchery . Havelock had thrown the party for his cousin Justice Lightbourne . If Justice 's fiance found out what went down last night , Esperanza wondered if she 'd still want to get married . It took forever for Esperanza to sit up . At least the weed helped soothe his headache a little . As much as he drank these days , he rarely got hangovers anymore , but last night he 'd gotten a little too carried away . He looked at his Herms watch . Three PM . Esperanza sat there for a long moment , like a toddler in a playpen anxiously waiting for a grown-up to pick him up and take him out to play . But no one was coming any time soon . It required a ridiculous amount of effort , but Esperanza finally managed to heave himself to his feet . The office spun for a few seconds , then stabilized to a low-key sway . Okay , Esperanza . You can do this . One step . Two steps . Three . He dropped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Behind him , the panoramic windows , which offered a spectacular view of Manhattan 's Upper West Side , were letting in too much blinding sunlight . Though he should 've gotten up and drawn the blinds , his body refused to obey the " get your ass up " command he repeated to himself several times . As he continued to puff on the joint , his eyes scanned the far wall . It was decorated with framed citations , awards and newspaper articles detailing his career from Navy SEAL to N.Y.P.D. homicide detective . A couple of newspaper headlines screamed : Lotto Cop Wins 30M ! That was the final chapter of his life in law enforcement . The ghetto kid from El Barrio in East Harlem , the oldest brother of three whose father prayed every day for him not to wind up on drugs , or in jail , or dead , like so many of the other boys in the neighborhood , was now a very wealthy man . Esperanza retired three years ago at the age of forty . No more crime scenes , decomposing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of it wiped away by the very first lottery ticket he ever purchased . He hit the jackpot , and it completely changed his life . Even made him a small-time celebrity for a short while . Esperanza appeared on a couple of talk shows and some local morning news programs , and did a television commercial for the New York State Lottery . Because he cut an imposing figure , with his rugged , dark , Boricua good looks , a couple of Hollywood agents believed he had the right stuff to become an action-movie star . A Puerto Rican Steven Seagal . Can you imagine that ? The talent agents offered to rep him and get him auditions at the major studios , but Esperanza politely declined . He 'd seen enough violence in real life and had no interest in playing pretend in some silly movie . Hell , he retired from the force because he was fed up with dealing with liars and criminals , so why would he want to go into the movie business ? Life was bien chvere . Esperanza was still madly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was formerly an investment banker , and now co-owner and manager of his club . She was five ten , with luscious legs that came up to her neck and glorious raven hair that came down to her waist , all topped off by a keen mind and discriminating taste . With Legs 's guidance and advice , Esperanza made some wise investments in various stocks , bonds , mutual funds and startup dot-coms , and they paid off handsomely . Unless he screwed it up in some kind of major way , he 'd never have to work another day for the rest of his life . Esperanza owned the hottest salsa club in New York , a beach house in Isla Verde , Puerto Rico , an apartment with a stunning wraparound view of Central Park and several vintage sports cars , including a 1967 Jaguar XKE coupe , a 1963 red Corvette convertible and a 1971 Ferrari Spider . A total clothes hound , his closets were full of Armani and Hugo Boss suits , Donna Karan dress shirts and Gucci shoes . Esperanza was a man-about-town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn cup of coffee he so desperately needed . He could also use a shower , a workout , a steam and a massage . Vaya , his afternoon was already mapped out for him . Esperanza picked up the phone and buzzed Legs at the bar downstairs , where she was most likely doing inventory . " Hey , angel , " he said in a raspy voice . " Well , well . The dead has risen , " she said . Esperanza loved the fact that Legs 's voice was always sultry , as if she 'd just had multiple orgasms . " You could 've woken me up , you know . Helped me get on the sofa . " " Floor 's better for your back . " " Keep it up with the smart mouth , mami . I 'll deal with you later . Do me a solid and ask Maria to bring me a giant cup of caf negro . " " I 'll think about it , " she replied and hung up . He also hung up the phone , thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes . That 's why he adored her so much . She kept him on his toes with that sarcasm of hers . A Puerto Rican Princess , a salsa diva , she was all the woman he 'd ever need . They do n't make ' em like her anymore . He stubbed out the joint in the crystal ashtray , dropped his head onto his folded arms and impatiently waited for Maria , the assistant manager , to show up with a dose of pure caffeine . Legs stepped into Esperanza 's office and stopped dead in her tracks when she heard the shower running . Esperanza , who was hiding behind the open office door , got excited as he spied on her . Legs dragged her fingers through her waves of shimmering hair and seemed to be debating whether she should come back later . She ran her tongue over her meaty , eminently kissable lips and yelled , " Mira , Nick . Why are you buggin ' me to come see you if you 're taking a shower ? " Esperanza kicked the door closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , startled by the loud noise . Before she could utter a word , he grabbed her and roughly pushed her , face first , against the door . " Assume the position , " Esperanza demanded , and without question , Legs complied . He was naked except for a towel wrapped around his waist . She bent forward and firmly planted her palms flat against the door , then placed her feet wide apart , like a suspect ready to be patted down . Legs 's body provocatively filled out her white , silk blouse and her tight , black skirt , which came to her knees and was slit high up the back . Before touching her , Esperanza 's eyes took a leisurely stroll along her sumptuous cuerpo . She was a straight-up mami , blessed with the kind of curvas that convinced even the most devout atheist that God does exist . Esperanza 's hands traveled up and down her thick thighs , then vigorously explored every inch of her warm body , caressing , squeezing and fondling . " What did I do , officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Legs admired Esperanza 's muscular body . He was six foot one , with copper skin , a square jaw and neatly trimmed , jet-black hair with streaks of silver at the temples . She always said he looked more like a rugged 1940s movie star than a cop . " You have the right to remain silent , " he said as she arched her back and rubbed her impressively round ass against his erection , which eagerly poked through the towel . " But I do n't necessarily want you to exercise that right . " He pulled up her skirt , revealing round , smooth cheeks accentuated by the line of a black thong . On her lower back , there was a tattoo of the sun glowing amber . Inside the sun , written in black Chinese calligraphy , was the word " hope , " the translation for " esperanza . " Legs wriggled her big Puerto Rican butt , urging him on . Esperanza pressed against her , and buried his face in her smooth-as-silk hair , which smelled faintly of coconut . She reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not gon na hurt me with your nightstick , are you ? " " Only if you resist . " He spun her around and kissed her slow and deep , his hand crawling underneath her skirt , pulling her panties to the side , penetrating her already soaked pussy . Legs recently got a Brazilian bikini wax and was extremely smooth down there . Her musky sex-scent hit him , and nothing turned Esperanza on like the bouquet of a woman ready to be ravished . " Then resist I will . " She gazed at him for a moment , her honey-hued , enigmatic eyes catching fire . She kissed him with such ferociousness , she made Esperanza 's head spin . He loved kissing those voluptuous lips of hers , so incredibly supple , hot tongue darting and spiraling and exploring . From the very first beso they shared back in high school , no woman had ever kissed him with such unbridled hunger . She gave him a hardy shove to the chest , knocking him back , then leaned against the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too big or too small . They were just right as far as Esperanza was concerned . Still taut and pert , and sprinkled with tiny , reddish freckles , they were beautiful . " Think you can handle me , papi ? " Her resplendent beauty entranced him . The golden afternoon light hit her body in a way that highlighted the arc of her hip and the roundness of her perky breasts . Her finely textured piel canela-cinnamon skin-gleamed with tiny beads of sweat , and he could no longer contain himself . Esperanza attacked her and crushed her body against his , sucking on her ear as she moaned . He slipped his cock inside her and was consumed by pure euphoria as he plunged deeper with every thrust . She nibbled his earlobe and whispered , " This could be constituted as sexual harassment , you know . " " I guess I 'll have to report you , then . " Legs and Esperanza melted into each other , mouths and legs and hands and fingers and tongues colliding and then drawing away , investigating and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eyes searching , making declarations of love , revealing passionate secretos . Arms encircling , thighs clamping , voices clamoring . " Oh , Legs , mi amor . You drive me so crazy . " " Yeah . You like that , papi chulo , don'tchu ? Mi macho . Dmelo . " Against the wall . On the desk . The floor . The sofa . Everything on fire . Skin , tongue , pussy , mouth , cock . Raw and tender . Loving and nasty . Kisses and caresses so familiar , yet always , always full of surprises . Legs stretched and groaned . " Hmm , that was fab , you horny beasty boy , you . " The office glowed bright orange as the sun lackadaisically retreated to its daily hiding place . Legs and Esperanza cuddled on the sofa , basking in rapturous satisfaction , limbs tangled in a knot of sheer tenderness . She grabbed his face and mashed it . " Tan chulo . " She planted a sloppy kiss on his mouth , followed by a hard slap to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us have a business to run . " He grabbed Legs 's wrist and looked at her platinum watch . " You can stay a little while longer . " " My boss would n't appreciate my slacking off . " His fingers gently painted circles along the small of her back where the tattoo was . " Fuck ' im . " " I already did . " Legs rested her head on his broad , hairy chest , and he squeezed the breath out of her . As far as Esperanza was concerned , to hell with the money , the cars , the clothes . These were the best of times , this soothing intimacy they shared . The tenderness . The laughs . They 'd been through it all : Breakups . Reconciliations . Marriages to other people followed by divorces . The bottom line was , through the toughest of times , they were always there for each other , no matter what . If there was ever a couple that should be called best friends , it was Legs and Esperanza . He could always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And that was a rare and wonderful thing . Esperanza smiled thoughtfully and said , " You 're my heart . " Even after all these years , Legs beamed every time he said those words . " And you 're mine . " She gave him a peck on the cheek and chuckled . " By the way , I 'm impressed that you managed to survive Justice 's bachelor party , " she said as she pinched his nipple . " Barely . " She looked up at him , squinted and scrunched her face . " You look like hell , papito . Got suitcases under your eyes , and shit . " " The price one pays for having fun . " " You did n't bang any of those strippers last night , right ? " " Of course not . Why pay for pussy when I have you ? " " Hey . Remember , " she said and gave his balls a gentle squeeze , making him wince . " This is the most expensive pussy you 'll ever have . " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me the sordid party details later . " She climbed off of him and began collecting her clothes . " I have to get back to work . " He turned onto his side , rested his head in his hand and admired her as she dressed . " I 'm going home and- " " You do n't have time , " Legs said . " You have to meet with Abuela in an hour . " " Shit , I forgot I was supposed to see your grandmother . " Legs wiggled into her skirt and chuckled . " With all the drinking and smoking and who knows what else you did last night , I 'm surprised you even remember your name . " Esperanza sat up and realized his headache was gone . No better cure for a hangover than sweet , nasty sex . " This is about Alina , right ? " Not again . Dealing with Legs 's buck-wild niece was not something he was in the mood for . " Do n't be coy , " she replied as she slipped on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alina 's younger brother , Cookie , ever since Legs 's sister Soledad-whose life revolved around cocaine , alcohol and bad boys-abandoned them several years ago . Alina used to be a well-behaved kid , until she entered that warped dimension called puberty , and now she seemed hell-bent on following in her mother 's footsteps . She ran away a couple of times , not liking her great-grandmother 's strict , traditional rules , and Esperanza was drafted into finding her and bringing her back . He was tired of this whole business with Alina . They needed to send her to an all-girl Catholic school or boot camp or something . He 'd gladly pay for it . " Chasing after runaways is n't one of my favorite pastimes , you know . We went through this last year . " " She did n't run away this time , " Legs said , sounding exasperated . " She disappeared . " " What makes you so certain ? " " Abuela said so . " Legs picked up a brush from his desk and ran it through her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partying for a few days wo n't kill ya . " " Says you . " Esperanza searched her eyes , knowing he did n't have a choice in the matter . " I 'll speak with your grandma , then make some inquiries . Okay ? " Legs sat down beside him and casually played with his flaccid penis . " That 's all I ask . " " You 're lucky I can never say no to you , " he said as he became harder with every dreamy stroke of her hand . (
