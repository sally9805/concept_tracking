Sleep survival I truly love your magazine and look forward to reading it cover to cover every month . Our one-year-old son was getting up two or three times each night , and my husband and I were feeling frustrated and very tired . I love rocking my kids to sleep , but waking up so many times was getting to me . After reading " Bedtime Stories " ( March ) , we started implementing some of the strategies mentioned , and he is now falling asleep on his own and sleeping better at night . Thank you so much for the article - it saved us . LISA MAHEDEN Lac La Biche , Alta . OUR BABY SLEEP JOURNEY started with our newborn son in a bassinet beside our bed . Once he moved to a crib , I camped out in the nursery and started bringing him into our bed during late-night feedings . He began stirring constantly and the only way to soothe him was to nurse him back to sleep - every hour . My husband and I were tired and at one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a change . My husband suggested trying the Ferber method . I was reluctant , but astonished when after the second night , our son began sleeping through the night . He now goes down for his naps and bedtime awake , and is able to soothe himself to sleep . We 're all sleeping better , but I can relate to Caroline Connell 's editorial ( March ) : I 'm sad that I no longer get to cuddle my son while he sleeps . I look forward to reading articles in Today 's Parent , as they recognize that there are many different answers to meet the needs of children . KIM BRADICA Brooklin , Ont . Food for thought MY THREE-YEAR-OLD son 's birthday invitations just went out and read : " In lieu of gifts , non-perishable food items for the food bank would be appreciated . " Perhaps this can give other parents an idea when planning birthday parties . KELLY BEALE By email Poverty and health RE : HEALTHY KIDS 2009 ( March ) . I understand that Canada must make injury and disease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to these issues , but I believe that poverty needs to be talked about as a health issue . As executive director of a family resource centre in inner-city Winnipeg , I see families that do not live in adequate housing ; do not have enough money to provide healthy food ; can not afford to have their children participate in recreational activities ; and can not afford clothing . All these factors affect children 's health . Where is our responsibility as a society to alleviate poverty and take care of all children so that they can live free of injury and disease and have the opportunity to reach their full potential ? SHARON TAYLOR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WOLSELEY FAMILY PLACE Winnipeg Editor 's note : We agree that poverty has a huge impact on kids ' health . That 's why Today 's Parent is working with Boys &; Girls Clubs of Canada to see healthy , active afterschool programs accessible to all Canadian kids , regardless of family income .

Cover concern I WAS EXCITED when I first glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother of a six- month-old , the topic of sleep is of interest to me . Unfortunately , my heart fell when I noticed that your adorable cover baby had her ears pierced ! In a society where kids are growing up too fast , I was surprised that your magazine would choose to support this gratuitous adult aesthetic . Is this really the message you want to be sending to new parents ? ANDREA JEFFREY Darmouth , NS Insurance RE : " Take This Advice to the Bank " ( March ) . I found this article helpful . However , I disagree with the expert who advised the Carnegie family that the father , who is not the breadwinner , does not need life insurance . If he were to die , how would the family handle child care ? A housekeeper , nanny or daycare is not free . TERESA COOPER Winnipeg Pet perspective RE : " Pet Detective " ( March ) . I just finished reading your article on choosing a pet and thought I should leap to the defence of our feline friends . Cats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs are not as great as dogs ' , playing , grooming and affection are all requirements for keeping cats healthy physically and mentally . And cleaning the litterbox " every few days " ? Um , no . Do you like to use a clean toilet ? Cats have an extremely acute sense of smell ; litterboxes should be cleaned daily . And cats and kids can be an amazing combination . They can teach each other volumes about respect and consideration and , provided both parties have been socialized properly , bonds will form that will last for many years . MELANIE LEAVEY REGISTERED VETERINARY TECHNICIAN Burlington , Ont . I WAS CONCERNED with your portrayal of birds as pets . I have three birds and I assure you that they require a heck of a lot more time than 30 minutes daily . Birds are among the most difficult pets to care for ; they require strict temperature control and lighting , exact : ing diets and lots of stimulation and attention , just to name a few of their needs ! Most birds are not great with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sudden movements . I would suggest to anyone thinking about bringing home a companion bird to do their research ( as any responsible person should do before bringing any pet home ) . There are many wonderful books out there and the Internet has a wealth of knowledge . KRIS KERR Trenton , Ont . Back to class THANK YOU for " Parent Turned Pupil " ( March ) . It 's nice to see I 'm not the only parent in school . I started my master 's degree last fall , when my daughter was 23 months old . Your tips were right on , from the need for organization and time management to family support and financial considerations . I did n't realize quite how tough it would be to manage my time , but I feel that I 'm setting a great example for my daughter by doing something for myself and working hard for what I want . JEN ZERKEE Burnaby , BC Car seats in cabs I WOULD LIKE TO comment to Saylor McLennan 's letter in Mailbag ( March ) about car seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and inquired about a car seat for my 13-month-old daughter . I was told that I was able to use my own , and the driver would return it to the taxi depot for my husband to pick up . However , the driver was reluctant when we came to the cab with the seat and said that parents always held their children on their laps ! With much insistence , the driver let me use the seat . In contrast , when we arrived in New Zealand , we were met by a seven-seater taxi with a car seat . SAMANTHA CLARK Sainte-Thrse , Que .
