CAN NAMES ALTE OUR SELF-PERCEPTION ? Photograph // Proper names are poetry in the raw , said the bard W.H. Auden . " Like all poetry , they are untranslatable . " Mapping your name onto yourself is a tricky procedure indeed . We exist wholly independently of our names , yet they alone represent us on our birth certificates and gravestones . Would a Rose by any other name be just as sweet-tempered ? Does Orion feel cosmically special ? Psychologists , parents and the world 's Oceans , Zanes and Timothys are divided on the extent to which first names actually matter . You named him what ? Today 's parents seem to believe they can alter their child 's destiny by picking the perfect-preferably idiosyncratic-name . ( Destiny , incidentally , was the ninth most popular name for girls in New York City last year . ) The current crop of preschoolers includes a few Uniques , with uncommonly named playmates like Kyston , Payton and Sawyer . From Dakota to Heaven , Integrity to Serenity , more babies are being named after places and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the upswing , like Jaxon , Kassidy , Mikayla , Jazmine and Nevaeh ( Heaven spelled backward ) , as are mix-andmatch names such as Ashlynn and Rylan . " For the first time in history , the top 50 names account for less than 50 percent of boys born each year , and for less than 40 percent of girls , " says Cleveland Kent Evans , professor of psychology at Bellevue University in Nebraska and author of Unusual &; Most Popular Baby Names . Evans believes that our homogeneous strip-mall culture fosters the desire to nominally distinguish our children . he cites a boom in unique names dating to the late 1980s but says the taste for obscure monikers developed in the 1960s , when parents felt less obligated to keep certain names in the family . " It 's really hard to name a kid , " says Jill Bass , 35 , who is expecting her second child . " It reflects what kind of person you are . " She and her husband , Carl Vogel , 37 , are struggling to find a name that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to go the Jake , Zak and Tyler route , " says Bass . " It will sound like one of those year-2000 names . We do n't want to sound as though we were trying so hard . " Distinguishing a child in just the right way is the first task parents feel charged with . Accordingly , parents-to-be increasingly track the popularity of names on the Social security Administration 's Web site and canvas the cottage industry of baby-name books . About 50 such books were published between 1990 and 1996 . Since 1997 , ' more than 100 new books have been published . Photograph // New parents rattle off diminutives and acronyms as if reciting scales . " I wanted a truly awesome , convertible name that could collapse into a normal name . Something like Charles Henry Underbill Grisham Sernovitz , because CHUGS would be a great college nickname , " says Andy Sernovitz , 33 , ' ' .. " whose son Charles Darwin Grisham Sernovitz was born last November . Darwin was a nod to mom ju lie Grisham 's science-writing vocation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teams , political parties , vacation spots and food cravings . Adam Orr , a die-hard Cubs fan , wanted to name his first child Clark Addison or Addison Clark , the names of the streets that form the intersection at Chicago 's Wrigley Field . Alas , he and his wife , Annisa , are expecting a daughter this spring . Records of kids named Espn tell of parents with a more general love of sports . Christie Brinkley reportedly named her youngest child Sailor as a tribute to a favorite pastime . Jamie Oliver , the British culinary star , christened his child Poppy Honey , not nearly so unfortunate a name as that of a poor soul dubbed Gouda . Increasingly , children are also named for prized possessions . In 2000 , birth certificates revealed that there were 298 Armanis , 269 Chanels , 49 Canons , 6 Timberlands , 5 Jaguars and 353 girls named Lexus in the U.S. The trend is not surprising : In an era in which children are viewed as accessories , such names telegraph our desire for creative , social or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Lexus grew up to drive a Honda Accord . While a name may be a palimpsest for parental aspirations ( hence the concerns of savvy parents that they not appear to be striving too hard ) , a name also reflects high hopes for the child himself . Choosing an uncommon name is perceived as an opportunity to give your child a leg up in life , signaling to the world that he or she is different . In Snobbery , cultural critic Joseph Epstein argues that a child named Luc or Catesby seems poised for greater achievements than selling car insurance . Am I really a Jordan ? The announcements are in the mail ; a religious ceremony may seal the decision . The name is chosen , and it is a word that will become so familiar that the child 's brain will pull it out of white noise . It is the first word she will learn to write . But what are the consequences of a particular name for self-image ? They 're not earth-shattering , according to a study by psychologist Martin Ford , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found no correlation between the popularity or social desirability of a given name and academic or social achievement . " This does n't mean that a name would ( never have any effect on a child 's development , " he explains . " But it does suggest that the probability of a positive effect is as large as that of a negative effect . It also suggests that a name is unlikely to be a significant factor in most children 's development . " Children and teens either struggle to stand apart or try desperately to fit in . A singular name eases the former pursuit but thwarts the latter . If parents give a child an offbeat name , speculates Lewis Lipsitt , professor emeritus of psychology at Brown University , " they are probably outliers willing to buck convention , and that parental trait will have a greater effect on their child than does the name . " A name may occasionally trigger expectations that are difficult to meet because a child lacks the appropriate talent or temperament . " If your parents are great musicians , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you can not live up to your name , " Lipsitt says . Likewise , a naturally shy child may cringe when he is introduced as Attila . No one can predict whether a name will be consistent with a child 's or a teen 's view of herself . The name could be ethnic , unique or white-bread , but if it does n't reinforce her sense of self , she will probably be unhappy with it and may even feel alienated from parents or peers because of it . An Annika with iconoclastic taste will be happy with her name , but a Tallullah who longs for a seat at the cheerleaders ' table may feel that her name is too weird . A child 's attitude toward his name is a gauge of self-esteem , says psychologist Ron Taffel , author of Nurturing Good Children Now . " If self-esteem is low , even a David or Jenny could hate their nameas a reflection of how they feel about themselves . " By the time most people reach adulthood , they have made peace with their name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Skyy will be gratified to learn , young adults today report that they feel buoyed by an unorthodox appellation . " It 's interesting knowing that very few people have your name , " says Cabot Norton , 35 . " It 's a point of pride to say , " I 've never met another Cabot . ' ' " Says Maren Connary , 29 , " I had a rebellious nature that I felt was justified by my name . If I 'd been named Mary , I think I 'd be more conformist . " " I hated my name when I was a kid , " Wven ( pronounced you-vin ) Villegas , 29 , says . " I stood out for all the wrong reasons . But I decided that if my name was n't the same as everyone else 's , then I would n't be the same , either . Now I love my name so much that I had it tattooed on my right arm . " Parents may be further empowered to christen their children idiosyncratically given that names are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kids today are used to a variety of names , so it is almost too simple for them to make fun of each other for that , " says Taffel . " Cruelty is more sophisticated now . " The experiences of children of mixed ethnic and racial backgrounds shed light on the power of names to determine identity . If such children are insecure or confused about their origins , the role of their name becomes more important . Donna Jackson Nakazawa , author of Does Anybody Else Look Like Me ? , advises parents of biracial or multi-ethnic children to choose a name that represents both branches of the family tree , or at least a nickname that does so . Nakazawa 's nine-year-old son is Christian Jackson Nakazawa ; his nickname is Chrischan , which means " dear beloved child " in Japanese . Nakazawa cites the cautionary tale of a young woman who was adopted from China by a white American couple who gave her a Chinese-sounding name . As a teenager , the girl began researching her heritage and discovered her name was not , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes the personal story behind a name can serve as an anchor . In most cases , Evans says , people are only at a disadvantage if there is no story attached to their name . " It does n't matter what the story is , as long as it is more complex than , " We just liked the name . ' ' " A name connected to previous generations can feel like your ancestors ' arms wrapped warmly around you . Not everyone agrees that the rationale behind a name is crucial . Misia Landau , a narratologist and science writer at Harvard Medical School , argues that the " story " of a name does n't necessarily drive personal narratives , because of the myriad factors at play . " Providing a child with a name is incredibly variable , " says Landau . " And I do n't think people today say , " Your namesake would never have acted that way . ' ' " But you do n't look like a Martha ! There are names you probably do n't think about at all-the equivalent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scarves of names , names that can not be ignored , that must be reckoned with . " People are always going to ask me why I .. ; . am named Cabot , " Norton " says . " And they are probably going to assume I am an East Coast WASP , whereas I 'm actually a North Florida atheist . " Photograph // Names produce piquant impressions : Olaf sounds oafish to non-Scandinavians . Shirley is perky . A ballerina named Bertha does n't sound as compelling as one named Anastasia . But are certain names better suited to some people than to others , and can a name change overhaul one 's self-image ? Michael Mercer , an industrial psychologist and co-author of Spontaneous Optimism , recalls a former co-worker who had interpersonal and legal problems : " She changed her name to Honore , and it was her way of mutating from someone who goofed things up to someone who is honorable . " Norma Sofia Marsano , 28 , had always been a Norma but decided to go by her middle name when she left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Norma held me back . Sofia sounds fun and cute , whereas Norma sounds like an ugly-girl 's name . I liked myself more when I started going by Sofia . " A name change may influence how we perceive ourselves and others because of racial , class or geographical stereotypes . Our " Anastasia " file may include adjectives like attractive , graceful and vaguely Slavic-descriptors that fit our conception of a ballerina but not a Bertha . Author Bruce Lansky has capitalized on these implicit associations with The Baby Name Survey Book : What People Think About Your Baby 's Name . Lansky compiled 100,000 impressions of 1,700 names , promising to help parents pick a name with positive connotations . Readers learn that Vanna is considered dumb , Jacqueline is elegant and Jacob , the number-one baby name for boys , is " a highly religious man who is old-fashioned and quiet . " Lansky 's " namesakes " ( Vanna White , Jackie 0 . , Jacob in the Old Testament ) are achingly transparent . And such associations hold only until we meet another Vanna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name attached to a " real " person , or even a photograph , will transcend stereotypes . Steele exposed a group of subjects to a set of names previously judged to be socially desirable ( Jon , Joshua , Gregory ) or undesirable ( Oswald , Myron , Reginald ) . A second group of subjects viewed these names accompanied by photographs . The addition of the photos erased the good or bad impression left by the name alone . To what degree , then , does a name elicit racial or ethnie bias ? Marianne Bertrand , a professor of economics at the University of Chicago , created resumes with names that are considered conspicuously white ( such as Brendan ) or black ( such as Jamal ) and found that regardless of credentials , resumes with white-sounding names generated twice as many callbacks . But this does n't mean that conspicuously " black " names , like Lashonda orTremayne , are themselves liabilities : The employers in Bertrand 's study might have discriminated against a black applicant regardless of his name . Roland Fryer , a professor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a black Lakeisha with similar socioeconomic backgrounds fared equally well . Whether people swoon over-or even disdainour name is beyond our control . Ultimately , selfesteem and the esteem of the world dictate the degree to which we hold our name dear . Like our vocation or hometown , we tout our name as a distinguishing mark if it " fits . " If it does n't , we might say that , like an inaccurate horoscope , we do n't believe in that stuff anyway . We 'll change our name , disregard it or consider it just a synonym for me .
