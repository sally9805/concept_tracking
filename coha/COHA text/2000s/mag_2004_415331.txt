Section : Technology A costly public-safety mandate by the FCC forced wireless carriers to track you anytime , anywhere . Six years later , the system is far from saving anyone anytime soon . <p> At 11:30 a.m. on a Saturday in November 1993 , 18-year-old Jennifer Koon was kidnapped in a shopping center parking lot in Pittsford , N.Y . Her abductor forced her into her car and drove to an unknown destination where he beat and raped her . At one point , Koon managed to dial 911 on her cell phone , possibly with her toes , says her father , David , now a state assemblyman . The 911 operator listened as Jennifer was killed  --  shot three times  --  but could do nothing to find her . The police later found her body in an alleyway . <p> Koon 's death , sealed by the inability of rescuers to track cell phones in emergencies , was exactly the kind of tragedy that prompted the Federal Communications Commission to adopt a mandate called e911 ( the " e " stands for " enhanced " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outfit their networks and phones with tracking technologies to find callers in distress . <p> Like so many well-intentioned public policies , e911 has sunk into a morass of delay and confusion . Every carrier missed the FCC 's Oct. 1 , 2001 deadline to begin the rollout of a national system . Now it wo n't near completion until 2006  --  ten years after the mandate was issued . By then carriers will have spent some $3 billion on a system geared to a tiny portion of all callers . And some carriers admit they may not even be able to solve the problem of accurately locating people . The FCC first decreed that states had to reimburse carriers through a subscriber tax , but then eliminated that requirement , sticking carriers with the bill . " To my knowledge , no one has ever done a cost-benefit analysis , " complains Mark Feidler , chief operating officer of Cingular Wireless . <p> Even a former FCC commissioner who voted in favor of e911 now regrets the decision . " It 's not clear to me that there was any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now a think-tanker at the American Enterprise Institute . <p> Tiny Rhode Island , with only one call center , has the only statewide deployment , installed by Verizon and Sprint . " This is a marathon . We 're talking about replacing 100 million wireless handsets and updating more than 120,000 wireless towers with new software , and in some cases new hardware , " says Travis Larson , spokesman for the Cellular Telecommunications &; Internet Association . <p> And yet , while the carriers grouse , a handful of entrepreneurs are eagerly selling tracking technology . Networks in Asia and Europe already offer popular location-based services such as friend finders , traffic alerts and restaurant searches . <p> When the FCC first adopted e911 it had no idea how location-tracking would work because the technology did n't even exist . The agency had nary a clue about the project 's total expense , offering a wild range from $510 million to $7.5 billion . Yet that did n't stop it from setting very strict standards . <p> Network-based systems , which would time the signals bouncing among cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within 300 meters 95% of the time . Handset-based technologies , which would use global positioning satellites to track chips inside phones , had to find a caller within 150 meters 95% of the time . <p> The e911 mandate was prompted by public safety groups . Dispatchers were used to locating people easily through their landline phones , but increased wireless usage was leaving gaps in the safety net . The groups , along with carriers , got the FCC to hash out the requirements for a national e911 system . At first it required the retrofitting of every tower with servers and software that calculate distance to a handset . The retrofits can cost up to $20,000 a tower , or $2.5 billion for the entire U.S. But as more accurate technologies emerged , some carriers began eyeing handset-based schemes that rely on communication between global positioning satellites and handsets . <p> Verizon is up and running in only a handful of counties in Virginia , Illinois and Indiana . Sprint was first to start selling GPS-enabled handsets last October , but has deployed service only in Rhode Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nextel are still field-testing their technologies ; the earliest they plan to deploy is in the fall . VoiceStream has budgeted $200 million for e911 through 2003 . Cingular has tests in Texas , with plans to install new hardware and software in at least 2,000 of its 17,000 base stations . <p> The states ' subscriber surcharges were supposed to pay for upgrades to the 6,000 public-safety answering points that take the distress calls . Yet many are far behind . A recent audit by New York Comptroller H. Carl McCall found that the state had collected $162 million in 911 surcharges . Yet none of the state police 's 20 call centers have been upgraded to get a call-back number in an emergency . ( The money instead went for trooper radio gear , dry cleaning , lawn mowing and travel . ) Now the surcharge is going up from 70 cents to $1.20 . <p> While the FCC has the authority to penalize carriers that slack on the initiative ( in May the FCC threatened to fine AT &T; Wireless $2.2 million , in part for missing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making sure that the call centers are holding up their end . <p> At some point , tracking technologies may pay for themselves , as they do in Europe and Asia . Orange , a U.K.-based cellular operator , has 30% of its wireless Web-enabled users looking for the closest pubs and nightclubs . " We see it as just another way to get people to use their phones more , " says project manager Matthew Grattan . <p> KDDI subscribers in Japan bought 1.8 million phones with GPS chips from SnapTrack , a division of Qualcomm , for an extra $10 per handset . Teens use them to get local traffic and weather , and to search for the nearest McDonald 's . <p> Meanwhile , tech vendors are feeding off the e911 gravy train . Grayson Wireless , a division of Allen Telecom , sells systems for base stations with processors that calculate where callers are . Orders of its $20,000 location sensors jumped from $7.8 million for 2001 to $12.5 million in just the first quarter of this year . As of July , Grayson had a $55 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ million in funding on the strength of its software that can locate callers within 90 feet in places where GPS signals are weak , like parking garages . " We have stronger algorithms than NASA , " boasts President Michael Kim . No one has signed on yet . <p> SignalSoft , which is being acquired for $59 million by Openwave Systems , sells software that enables callers to get a local weather report or find a house for sale in a nearby neighborhood . Several carriers have struck deals to use SignalSoft for e911 services , but none yet for its consumer applications . Eric McCabe , head of marketing at SignalSoft , is desperate enough that he 's giving half-day seminars coaching carriers ' marketing teams on what they can charge customers and how to launch . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Victoria Murphy and Nicole Ridgway <p>
