<p> Different hiphop historians have different accounts of just when rappers began poppin ' , lockin ' and rhymin ' on the silver screen . As newly minted rapper/ actor 50 Cent gets his first round of reviews for the autobiographical Get Rich or Die Tryin ' , few would dispute that hip-hop stars moonlighting as actors have come a long way in the past two decades . <p> Kool DJ Herc , the Jamaican native credited with inventing breakbeat DJing and often referred to as the father of hiphop culture , played himself in 1984 's Beat Street alongside hip-hop pioneers like Melle Mel and Kool Moe Dee . <p> Mr. Wiggles , a member of the early ' 80s break dance collective the Rock Steady Crew , claims on his Web site that his collective was the fi rst to break into mainstream theaters in 1983 when the group was featured in Flashdance . <p> Other cited starting points include 1984 's Breakin ' featuring Ice-T as a DJ and Krush Groove , released the following year , which had an all-star cast including Run-D.M.C. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't really get a chance to act as lead characters until 1991 . <p> That year started with Ice-T playing a cop opposite Wesley Snipes ' drug kingpin in New Jack City , a fi lm that not only made him a multimedia star , but spawned a hip-hop subgenre on radio . Months later director John Singleton placed formidable N.W.A rapper Ice Cube as Darin " Doughboy " Baker in Boyz n the Hood . <p> Since that dramatic breakthrough , the intertwining of beat boxes and box offices have gone together like gin and juice . <p> Will Smith , the artist formerly known as the Fresh Prince , became a summertime superstar who could carry big-budget action fi lms ; he also earned dramatic cred with roles in Six Degrees of Separation and Ali ; the latter earned him a best actor Oscar nomination . Queen Latifah also earned an Oscar nomination for her work in Chicago . Ice Cube ( the Friday films ) and Snoop Dogg ( Training Day , Starsky and Hutch ) have shown that they can successfully carry and add laughs to comedies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mic can pull it off on the big screen . Here 's a look at the best and worst hip-hop has to offer on celluloid : <p> Rapper-turned-actor : 50 Cent ( real name : Curtis Jackson ) <p> Films : Get Rich or Die Tryin ' <p> Commitment level ( from 1 to 5 ) : Too early to tell . <p> Props : Like Eminem , 50 Cent has proved he can play himself . Also like Em , he has provided a bulletproof soundtrack . <p> Dis : Also like Em , he now has to show that he can do something different . <p> Bankability : Ask us next Monday . <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Queen Latifah ( real name : Dana Owens ) <p> Films : Chicago , Set It Off , others <p> Commitment level : 5 <p> Props : She strikes a great balance between comedic timing and dramatic tension . Might have earned that Oscar for Chicago had co-star Catherine Zeta-Jones not nabbed it . <p> Dis : Her charm is more limited in action films like Set It Off . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still brings presence . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Diddy ( real name : Sean Combs ) <p> Films : Made , Monster 's Ball , others <p> Commitment level : 1.5 <p> Props : He sings , dances ( poorly ) , produces and designs clothes : His decision to act was no surprise . <p> Dis : Perhaps he 's got too much going on , since his movie credits are few . <p> Bankability : If Diddy finds roles like his convict in Monster 's Ball , it could be all about the Benjamins . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Will Smith <p> Films : Independence Day , Ali , others <p> Commitment level : 5 . The first rapper to become better known for his acting than rhyming . <p> Props : Was taken seriously after Six Degrees of Separation and earned an Oscar nomination for Ali . But Smith is at his best fronting a summer juggernaut . Can you say cha-ching ? <p> Dis : Keep this Prince off of horses . Wild , Wild West ( 1999 ) proved he was n't invincible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's box-office gold . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Eminem ( real name : Marshall Mathers ) <p> Films : 8 Mile , The Wash <p> Commitment level : 2 <p> Props : His character in 2002 's 8 Mile was loosely based on his own life , but he drew positive notices . 50 Cent can only hope Get Rich will have the same appeal to young hip-hop fans . <p> Dis : Was it Eminem 's acting or the stellar soundtrack ( with the Oscar-winning song Lose Yourself ) that was the key to the film 's success ? <p> Bankability : A low-yield investment unless Eminem has some more closetcleaning to do . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Snoop Dogg ( real name : Calvin Broadus ) <p> Films : Starsky &; Hutch , Training Day , others <p> Commitment level : 2.5 <p> Props : He 's become such a lovable character on-screen that many forget the Long Beach native was once a gang member . His Huggy Bear made Starsky &; Hutch worth seeing . <p> Dis : Stereotypical roles in low-rent ventures like The Wash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Training Day . <p> Bankability : Right now he 's a pup . But has the ability to be a silver-screen Doggfather . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Ice-T ( real name : Tracy Marrow ) <p> Films : New Jack City , Judgment Day , others Commitment level : 5 <p> Props : Between TV and movies , Ice-T has the longest resume of any rapper-actor . Interesting that the artist who wrote Cop Killer now plays a cop on the small screen . <p> Dis : He should have passed on the TV movie Leprechaun 5 : Leprechaun in the Hood . <p> Bankability : Not a longterm investment , but prone to lucrative spikes . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Andre 3000 ( real name : Andre Benjamin ) <p> Films : Be Cool , Four Brothers <p> Commitment level : 2 <p> Props : As thug sidekick to Cedric the Entertainer 's baddie in Be Cool , Dre makes the most of a few lines and bad aim with a pistol . <p> Dis : Perhaps he 's trying to show some versatility : Next year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Web . <p> Bankability : A low-risk prospect with potential longterm payoff . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Ice Cube ( real name : O'Shea Jackson ) <p> Films : Boyz N The Hood , Three Kings , others <p> Commitment level : 5 <p> Props : He 's done drama , comedy and action . Could be poised for a Will Smith style break-out . <p> Dis : Like Snoop , he needs to avoid low-budget comedies that put him in lightweight roles . In other words , no more Friday sequels . <p> Bankability : Golden , though xXx : State of the Union suggests he 's not quite platinum . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : LL Cool J ( real name : James Todd Smith ) <p> Films : Any Given Sunday , Deep Blue Sea , others <p> Commitment level : 4 <p> Props : Spent much of the ' 90s focusing on a career in movies and TV . <p> Dis : He 's phenomenal as a supporting character , but has n't turned the corner into leading man . <p> Bankability : Capable of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the can . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Mos Def ( real name : Dante Smith ) <p> Films : Something the Lord Made ( TV ) , The Woodsman , others <p> Commitment level : 4 <p> Props : He 's earned Golden Globe and Emmy noms for Something the Lord Made . He 's also versatile , capable of quiet intensity ( The Woodsman ) and slapstick comedy ( Chapelle 's Show ) . <p> Dis : So far he usually gets stuck in secondary roles . <p> Bankability : His comic timing and charisma make him a great long-term prospect . <p> ... <p> Rapper-turned-actor : Dr. Dre ( real name : Andre Young ) <p> Films : Training Day , The Wash , others Commitment level : 1 <p> Props : Held his own during a three-way gunpoint standoff with Denzel Washington and Ethan Hawke in 2001 's Training Day . <p> Dis : Nothing worth talking about besides that . <p> Bankability : Put your money on his rhyming , not comedy timing . <p> ... <p> Others : <p> Late with wasted potential for great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dishonorable mention : Ja Rule ( The Fast and the Furious ) ; Master P ( Gone in 60 Seconds ) ; Vanilla Ice ( Cool as Ice ) . 1-COVER PARAMOUNT PICTURES , 14 .
