<p> Before DeMarcus Dobbs plays a game at Georgia , we know this much : He has 271 friends . He was at Whitney 's for a party over Memorial Day weekend . ( But he does n't drink or smoke . ) He broke Jake the Snake 's nose . ( But it was Justin 's fault . ) He has a girl named Anna who will always love him despite the paint handprint he put on her shirt . And he 'd better bring his money next time he sees Bobby " cuz it 's on . " <p> Welcome to the online social **25;4999;TOOLONG world of MySpace.com , Facebook.com and dozens of similar Internet sites . <p> That emerging world has started to collide with a well-established one  --  college athletics . <p> The resulting big bang is what coaches , athletic departments and players have started to deal with in recent months . Administrators and coaches , previously out of touch with the new technology , are coming to understand its power and their athletes ' sometimes brazen willingness to share almost anything on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle and high school administrators , police and parents who for months have worried about safety and privacy consequences of posting private information on the sites . <p> The sites have begun to respond to such concerns . For example , MySpace recently tightened access to some profiles and appointed a chief security officer who formerly served as a federal prosecutor . <p> At Northwestern University , photos of the women 's soccer team hazing the freshmen players , taken from Webshots.com , surfaced on BadJocks.com . <p> The Evanston , Ill. , university was one of the 12 schools where athletes had posted various pictures of alcohol-fueled behavior . BadJocks.com grabbed the photos from the public domain of Webshots.com , packaged them , called them " The Dirty Dozen " and had more than 600,000 unique visitors the day the story broke . <p> At Louisiana State University , swimmers Eddie Kenney and Matt Coenen were booted from the team after it was learned of their disparaging remarks about the coach on Facebook.com , a wildly popular site where college students interact and can re-create their image with a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tackle Clint O'Neal was suspended from the Champs Sports Bowl after he was accused of sending a racially threatening facebook message to a Hispanic cross country runner . He was also ticketed by campus police for harassment . <p> At Kent State , Facebook.com , open to those with an e-mail address that ends in . edu , was banned after athletics director Laing Kennedy became concerned about athletes ' safety and his school 's image . <p> Kennedy , who received harsh criticism , quickly backed off his ban and said last week he now restricts and monitors athletes ' use of the site . <p> " You have student-athletes misrepresenting their team and theirselves , " Kennedy said . " We had one situation that really got our attention . There was some information inappropriate outside the realm of the team that was leading down a road we felt became dangerous . " Kennedy would n't provide further details . <p> That dangerous road , according to Kennedy and other athletics directors , is lined with hangers-on , gamblers and agents who could use a Facebook friendship to compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect : The image of the program , which at its core operates like a business , and of the athletes who make that business money . <p> " From the stance of an athletic department , the thing that is the most dangerous to them is the disclosure of information , and information that shines a negative light back to the program , " said Fred Stutzman , a University of North Carolina doctoral student who has published a paper on Facebook.com . " There is so much money tied into these departments , I think that they want to control all variables they can control . " <p> The University of Georgia exercised control in the spring . Football coach Mark Richt had someone from his staff surf the sites , and Richt subsequently asked a few players to take down items that could be viewed negatively . <p> Richt said it was for the players ' protection . <p> " Everybody 's got to be careful with what they put out there , " he said . " These guys are ours . Just like I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there and see what 's going on . " <p> Facebook officials also are concerned about the images posted and the messages those might send . <p> " Student athletes should not be posting pictures that show them drinking when they are underage or with illegal drugs , " said Melanie Deitch , director of marketing for the company . " It is against our terms of service to post such pictures . " <p> There is also the future to think about , said Georgia athletics director Damon Evans . Because once an image is portrayed on the Internet , it may not be forgotten . <p> " Stuff spreads on there pretty quickly , " Georgia quarterback Joe Tereshinski said . " If you want to have a party going on , you can get on there and set one up that night . <p> " Then if people get mad at you for some certain reason , your picture is up there , or any type of information about you . It might not be true . But if it is up there , people are going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history <p> Georgia , as well as Georgia Tech , continues to grapple with the proper response to the increasing presence of online sites in players ' lives . <p> " This is a very public domain , and there are potential consequences , " Tech athletics director Dan Radakovich said . <p> Radakovich , who has been at the university three months , knows the consequences better than most . He was working in LSU 's athletic department when Kenney and Coenen were dismissed . <p> " That was the first heads-up we got of Facebook.com 's potential , " he said . " But even a year ago , Facebook was not as prevalent as it is now . " <p> Today , Stutzman said , the Web site 's market penetration is astounding . At North Carolina , 94 percent of incoming freshmen signed up for a free Facebook.com account . <p> " Every college student seems to have a digital camera , " said Bob Reno , publisher of BadJocks.com " They are all wired to the Internet . Then you combine the social networks , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm . " <p> And the storm clouds continue to grow . Even after the publication of " The Dirty Dozen , " more photos were found and compiled into the " Dirty 30 " on a separate site . <p> ' Put that on the Internet ' ? <p> " People need to understand they have a role and responsibility to a larger community , " said Peter Roby , director for the Boston-based Center for the Study of Sport in Society . " Why in the world they would want to put that on the Internet is mind-boggling . " <p> Athletics administrators have found they can exert some control . <p> Shortly after student athletes sign scholarship agreements with schools , they also sign codes of conduct , which can include any number of stipulations . Athletic scholarships are renewed on a year-to-year basis . <p> " We have always recognized that students can give up certain rights to play athletics in college , " said Greg Lukianoff , president of TheFire.org , a group that fights to defend the right to free speech on college campuses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do recognize that universities have increased power to place limitations on students who are athletes . <p> " We have seen a worrisome trend this might be going a bit far . " <p> Such as in Kent State 's case . Only approved friends are allowed on Facebook.com  --  a blocking tool can keep the unwanted out  --  and coaches must be given access . <p> " Blocking people out , that is counterintuitive to how the network works , " UNC 's Stutzman said . " Being on the facebook is a critical part of being at college because it is so widely used . Students plan out gatherings , they communicate with each other , they really leverage a lot of what the facebook offers . If you are not a part of that , it would be like a college student without a cellphone now . " <p> Lukianoff said it also could damage the educational experience . <p> " Universities are places that are supposed to welcome and nurture freedom of speech , " he said . " Open academic expression requires unfettered and uncensored speech @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up all your express rights to be on the sports team ? By monitoring or censoring these sites , college athletic programs seem to be ignoring that these are both athletes and students , " he said . <p> ON AJC.COM <p> * Online forum : What do you think of coaches review networking sites ? <p> WHAT IS . . . <p> * Myspace.com ?
