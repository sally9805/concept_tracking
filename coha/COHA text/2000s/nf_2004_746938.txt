ARS scientists learn more about mass migrations of grasshoppers  --  and how to prevent them <p> In a year when insects are making appearances in the millions , and even trillions  --  17-year cicadas disrupting daily life in the East , 3-mile-wide bands of Mormon crickets blanketing fields and roadways in the West  --  it makes sense that insects capable of stripping a field bare and stopping rush-hour traffic are capturing people 's attention . <p> In some parts of the West , grasshoppers , which seem so harmless when they leap out of sight at our presence , can reach population densities that might seem supernatural . <p> While they 're a food source for many wildlife and bird species , grasshoppers , at times , can number in the hundreds of millions in states like Colorado , Wyoming , and California . At outbreak densities , they gobble up valuable forage from rangelands used by livestock and compete with wildlife on native grasslands . Damage from the insect  --  which can eat half its weight in a day  --  can reach $390 million a year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Laboratory in Sidney , Montana , believe that relief from future hopper outbreaks lies largely in taking a preventive approach . By uncovering the biology and ecology underpinning these population surges , the researchers hope to be able to reduce the likelihood and scale of grasshopper outbreaks . <p> They 're also investigating ways to reduce the need for aerially sprayed pesticides that have historically been used to combat hopper scourges . Some of these chemicals may pose a risk for nontarget organisms , especially when applied to vast acreages . And they 're not a cost-effective solution for ranchers who seek hopper control over the long term , since the cost of conventional treatment can exceed the value of the forage itself . Hooved Helpers <p> Drought conditions set the stage for a population explosion because developing hoppers thrive in a warm , dry environment with patches of bare soil . These patches offer grasshoppers the perfect opportunity to bask in the sun . That 's important because hoppers need energy from the sun to develop and process food , according to entomologist David H. Branson , who is with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots . But grazing at the right time of the year and in the right environmental conditions can curb hopper numbers by creating unfavorable habitats for them . <p> Building on studies begun by entomologist Jerome A. Onsager , now retired from ARS , Branson is researching how the timing and intensity of various grazing schemes affect grasshopper densities and the plant communities they depend on . <p> " With the appropriate grazing system , we can reduce bare soil , increase shading from plants , or control how much vegetation is removed at critical periods of the grasshopper 's life cycle and decrease its development and survival rates , " Branson says . <p> In a study using caged grasshopper populations at Miles City , Montana , with rangeland scientist Marshall Haferkamp , from ARS 's Fort Keogh Livestock and Range Research Laboratory , Branson found that differently timed sheep-grazing schemes during a severe grasshopper outbreak ( more than 100 hoppers per square yard ) did n't have a significant effect on hopper population dynamics . That indicated that livestock grazing during severe outbreaks will not have a significant effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are already eating so much vegetation that grazing wo n't make a difference , " Branson says . But during less severe outbreaks , grazing might be beneficial . <p> A complex matrix of factors affects whether or not grazing is the right solution to grasshopper problems . Weather conditions , grasshopper densities , and the type and composition of plant communities must all be considered . Branson is studying different grazing strategies over large areas  --  from 100 to 1,000 acres  --  to see which grazing systems reduce grasshopper problems . Fire on the Range <p> Sidney researchers have turned to another force that can alter grasshopper habitats : fire . <p> One such fire that occurred near the Montana laboratory was n't planned . It rolled through the U.S. Forest Service 's Little Missouri National Grassland in western North Dakota in the late fall of 2001 . Fortunately , it swept through an area where the researchers had already established sampling sites for another experiment . <p> " A year after the fire , we saw a significant reduction in grasshopper densities , " says Branson . Different grasshopper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . " Pods at shallow depths died , as did grasshoppers that spend the winter as nymphs . But pods laid deeper appeared less affected by the fire . " <p> Branson and colleague Lance T. Vermeire , an ARS rangeland ecologist at Fort Keogh in Miles City , are further investigating how fire affects individual species of grasshoppers and their eggs as well as the plant communities on which they depend . <p> In a prescribed fire conducted in the Little Missouri National Grassland , Branson again observed a short-term reduction in grasshopper densities after the bum . But only a few of the dozen species that can contribute to an outbreak appeared to be affected . <p> " If a few particular species of grasshopper are dominating an area , fire could be beneficial for reducing hopper numbers , " Branson says . " But we 'd also have to consider the fire 's effects on rangeland conditions , plant production , and ground cover . " Rangeland Recyclers <p> For all the trouble grasshoppers seem to cause , researchers are finding that they could be fulfilling an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prairies . <p> Grasshoppers digest only about 12 to 20 percent of the plant material they eat . The rest is excreted as " frass , " which acts as fertilizer for the surrounding vegetation . " We 're finding that in some instances , grasshoppers can improve rangeland productivity , " says Branson . " It depends on what they 're eating : When they feed on plants that decompose more slowly , they are able to cycle those nutrients back to the environment faster . " <p> One long-term goal is to figure out which prevailing ecological conditions allow grasshoppers to have this desired effect . " Grasshoppers actually have very specific plant preferences , so the particular combination of plants and hoppers on rangeland plays a big role . It could be that if a rancher is facing moderate grasshopper densities  --  and the right rangeland conditions exist  --  it might be a bad idea to try to control the hoppers . In the long run , they could be doing more good than bad , especially when you consider what it costs to control them . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ control might prove beneficial to long-term rangeland productivity . Fungal Foes <p> Stefan T. Jaronski , an insect pathologist at the Sidney laboratory , studies naturally occurring microbes that can be used to suppress outbreaks of hoppers as well as Mormon crickets . The fungus Beauveria bassiana appears to be a strong candidate . <p> " Beauveria is like a fatal case of athlete 's foot for these insects , " Jaronski explains . " Grasshoppers often pick up the fungal spores on their feet  --  and because of the insects ' open circulatory system , the fungus grows very quickly inside their bodies . " <p> He 's been investigating the efficacy of Beauveria in a base of canola oil , a known grasshopper attractant . But Jaronski recently found a new twist to the oil carrier . <p> " It turns out that raw , unprocessed canola oil , which is black and rather strong-smelling , is even more effective as an attractant than the refined , store-bought oil we 've previously used , " he says . <p> Very close to the stuff that is extracted from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acids hoppers find so irresistible . Greenhouse tests so far indicate that the oil can increase the effectiveness of the fungus . Large-scale field trials to verify these observations are being conducted by ARS along with USDA 's Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service and the University of Wyoming . <p> Strains of another fungus , Metarhizium anisopliae var. acridum , are also getting Jaronski 's attention . " It 's far more virulent and specific than Beauveria , " he says . " It affects only insects of the group Orthoptera , like grasshoppers and locusts , and not honey bees , beetles , or other potentially beneficial species . " <p> Safety data have been generated by scientists in Africa and Australia who are using Metarhizium on locusts . Jaronski 's lab tests have shown it to be highly infectious for most American grasshoppers . He 's eager to study the fungal strains ' effect on hoppers and is working with international scientists to bring the two promising strains into the United States for field trials . <p> This research is part of Crop Protection and Quarantine , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wide Web at www.nps.ars.usda.gov . <p> To reach scientists featured in this article , contact Erin Peabody , USDA-ARS Information Staff , 5601 Sunnyside Ave. , Beltsville , MD 20705-5129 ; phone ( 301 ) 504-1624 , fax ( 301 ) 504-1641 . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Measuring soil nutrients , plant productivity , nutritional quality , and grasshopper species composition responses to summer fire and postfire grazing , rangeland ecologist Lance Vermiere takes soil samples as technician Sue Reil clips vegetation for nutrient analysis . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Entomologist David Branson ( foreground ) and ecologist Greg Sword examine images of grasshopper gut material to identify the types of plants they consume . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Melanoplus grasshoppers that have been killed by the fungus Beauveria bassiana . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Greg Sword uses a computerized video tracking system to analyze Mormon cricket behavior . <p> By Erin Peabody , ARS <p> What Makes Insects Mass and March ? <p> Ecologist and insect behaviorist Gregory A. Sword , at ARS 's Northern Plains Agricultural Research Laboratory in Sidney , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ periodically swell . And when they do , why do they mass and migrate ? <p> In particular , Sword wants to discover what triggers the insects ' specific movements  --  a sudden veer or turn or an increase in speed , for example . With this information , he may one day be able to predict the insects ' trajectory enough in advance to help ranchers and others minimize their losses . <p> The walking habits of a lone Mormon cricket or grasshopper might seem trivial . But the cumulative effects of millions of insects walking in mile-long bands , threatening to shear off crops and vegetation , can be devastating . <p> Many researchers have thought that Mormon crickets  --  and possibly grasshoppers  --  behave like their cousins , migratory locusts . Locusts become more energetic when they 've been reared among many other individuals . This so-called gregarious phase can lead to destructive mass-swarming . <p> Sword wanted to find out whether high rearing density could also explain the migrating bands of Mormon crickets that inflict damage each year in the West . After comparing crickets reared alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rearing density was n't playing a role in the movements of Mormon crickets . <p> " Instead , I found that their collective movement was deter mined by simple interactions among individual crickets within the group , " Sword explains . " Lots of animals do this  --  schools of fish , herds of cattle . They move together as a group across their environment . " <p> Traveling with a large crowd of individuals might appear to be counterproductive , but Sword explains that it offers an advantage . " An individual in a group has a smaller chance of being singled out and attacked by a predator than one that 's alone .
