<p> On April 20 , 1999 , Michael Johnson was sitting on the grass with friends outside Columbine High School during his lunch period when two gunmen started shooting . <p> A bullet shattered part of Mr. Johnson 's jaw and severely injured his leg . He was among the first students to be carried from the scene and treated , but it still took several medical procedures , months of patience , and his family 's prayers before Johnson was able to eat solid food and walk freely . <p> As a result of that experience , Johnson says , " My faith was accelerated . " He harbors no ill will toward the gunmen or anyone connected to Columbine . For the most part , he 's just grateful to be alive . <p> Five years ago Tuesday , two young men - Dylan Klebold and Eric Harris - walked into their school carrying a small arsenal of weapons . They killed 12 students and one teacher , and injured more than 20 others before taking their own lives . <p> Tuesday night , the Littleton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service in a park near the school . Some in the town remember the event as one that increased their faith and turned them to God for comfort . Others see it as a day in which a community lost its innocence . And still others are bitter toward school and law-enforcement officials who , they believe , failed to protect them . <p> But for the students who were in the school that day , the challenge of the past five years has been finding a way back to normal life after the nation 's worst school shooting . The entire country felt the impact of what happened that day at Columbine , but it was a few hundred teenagers who - along with their teachers and school administrators - actually lived it . <p> " Right after it happened I was very scared , " says Stephanie Salmon , who that day - then a freshman in high school - was in the library where most of the shootings occurred . " I had a lot of anxiety for about a year but it 's gradually decreased . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Colorado in Boulder . She studies kinesiology and exercise science and hopes to become a physical therapist . She also takes classes in modern dance simply because " it 's a blast . " <p> But among her many activities she also finds time to call home often . Her mother , she says , was perhaps even more frightened by the events at her school that day than she was . <p> " She gets worried very easily , " says Salmon . In fact , her mother 's fears were a factor in choosing a college . Once she might have considered schools in Florida or California . But after the shooting , she says , staying close to home made more sense . <p> Salmon 's classmate Elizabeth Kwerneland says there has not been a day during the past five years that she has not thought about what happened on April 20 , 1999 . " I can still remember every detail , " says Ms. Kwerneland , who was an acquaintance of Dylan Klebold 's . <p> Today she is a sophomore at Northern Colorado State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to become a counselor - a decision shaped in part by her gratitude for the help she received from therapy after the shootings . <p> Sometimes when people find out she graduated from Columbine , she says , they " look at me kind of strangely , like ' Uh oh , is she going to cry ? ' " <p> But cry she does n't . She is coping well , she says , as are her family members , including her brother who was also a student at Columbine on the day of the shootings . But Kwerneland says she does sometimes resent assumptions others make about what the school - and the survivors - must be like . <p> " People who went to Columbine were not crazy , " she says . It 's just , she adds , that " we 're dealing with something that not a lot of people have dealt with . " <p> For Brooks Brown , however , a senior at Columbine on that day and a friend of the gunmen , the shootings were an indictment of the school 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No Easy Answers : The Truth Behind Death at Columbine , " to try to explain how the authorities missed signs that Dylan and Eric were planning a massacre . <p> On the day of the shootings , he was leaving school to smoke a cigarette and passed Eric Harris in the parking lot . Brown had been a close friend of both Klebold and Harris and says he knew about the extraordinary isolation and alienation Dylan and Eric felt . About a year before the shootings , Brown and Eric had a falling out but then reconciled . <p> Brown was not harmed in the attacks . His connection to the shooters , though , later earned him death threats from other students , and school officials asked him not to return when classes resumed . <p> He finished his senior year on his own . <p> In the past , Brown has spoken out publicly about bullying and bullying prevention . He calls Columbine " the largest learning experience anyone can have . " <p> He is convinced that Dylan and Eric were n't monsters , or if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . " He claims that a culture of constant bullying and verbal intimidation existed at Columbine , and that , combined with the boys ' personalities and Harris 's mental instability , created the lethal mix that led to the massacre . <p> But today Brown says he 's done speaking about bullying . He wants to put Columbine behind him and focus on a career in filmmaking . <p> Like other students who were at Columbine that day , Michael Johnson agrees the experience shaped him , but battles against allowing it to define him . He recognizes , however , that it 's hard to escape the notoriety entirely . <p> " If people ask , I 'll tell them , " Johnson says , " but I like for them to get to know me first . " <p> Johnson and his family are members of the Church of Jesus Christ Latter-day Saints . He , along with two other LDS students from Columbine wrote about their experiences in a recently released book , " Surviving Columbine , " which emphasizes the role of religious faith in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , remains a concern for some of the students who feel the media offered a distorted image of the school and the town that they knew . <p> " I never saw any bullying problems , " Salmon says . " I 'm sure it was there , but I never had any problems . And it was n't really a violent school . The lines between jocks and different cliques were not as heavy as the media makes it out to be . " <p> But the storm created by the media attention continued to hang over the town , and its return to normalcy was perhaps delayed by further tragedies . In the years following the shootings , two Columbine sophomores were murdered at a Subway sandwich shop , and the mother of one of paralyzed survivors , Anne Marie Hochhalter , committed suicide . <p> But in some ways , insist the Columbine survivors , there is a positive legacy they carry with them today . They have a perspective on life - and perhaps a passion for it - they could not otherwise have achieved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " normal " high school experience . " That happened when I was a freshman in high school so my whole high school experience was pretty abnormal . " <p> But today she says she realizes that " Columbine influenced me to make something of my life , and to enjoy my life , " because she learned she says , " how easily it could be taken away . " <p> Kwerneland says she felt her brother expressed it well when they recently spoke of Columbine . <p> He told her , " We have witnessed the good and the bad of things . We 're different people for what we have seen . That does n't make us bad and that does n't make us good . It just makes us different . " <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 . The Christian Science Monitor
