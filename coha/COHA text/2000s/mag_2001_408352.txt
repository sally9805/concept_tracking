Section : Caring For Mom &; Dad " My mom recently had a bout of shingles . It 's gone now , but she 's still got a lot of pain . What can she do to prevent flare-ups ? " <p> Shingles , or herpes zoster , is a frequently misunderstood medical problem that can have painful and debilitating consequences lasting well beyond the initial episode . What your mom is experiencing sounds like a side effect of shingles called post-herpetic neuralgia ( PHN ) . This is a particularly common development in people who contract shingles after the age of 50 . A Childhood Disease <p> Originally , your morn probably acquired this infection as a child in the form of the more familiar disease chicken pox , which is caused by the varicella-zoster virus ( VZV ) . Typical symptoms include fever , a flulike syndrome , and those infamous little red skin blotches that cover your body and face . These symptoms eventually clear as your body mounts an immune response to the illness . <p> But here 's where it gets interesting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other viruses . Your immune system controls the initial illness but does not completely eliminate the virus from your body . Instead , the . virus hides in your nervous system , usually in your spinal cord or other nerves , where it can lie dormant indefinitely . But sometimes , many years later , it resurfaces as shingles . Same Virus , Different Problem <p> We do n't fully understand why the virus reactivates , but we do know that it 's more common in older adults and people whose immune system is weakened . Whatever the reason , when it does reactivate , it does not take the same form as the original chicken pox . Instead , the virus travels out along a nerve from its resting place in the spine and produces a characteristic rash . Tingling or pain often precedes the onset of the rash , which may start as a red blotchy area followed by small blisters that can be fluid filled . Ultimately , the rash scabs over and subsides . <p> One of the ways doctors identify a rash as shingles is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also its location . The rash tends to follow the route that the infected nerve takes in the body . Common places to get shingles include the trunk , Chest , and back , the lower part of the spine or neck , areas of the face that can involve the eyes , and along other nerves on the extremities . In the most severe cases of shingles , patients can get ill with fever ; weakness of the affected areas can sometimes occur , The rash may leave scars . <p> The most debilitating and , unfortunately , common complication I see as a geriatrician is PHN , which is characterized by pain that occurs in the area of the original rash long after the acute bout of shingles has ended . It can be very difficult to control with common pain medications and can last for years . Preempting the Pain <p> A variety of antiviral medications are available , including acyclovir , famciclovir , and valacyclovir . But for them to be most effective , they need to be given as early as possible in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the appearance of the rash . In general , these medicines appear to speed the healing time of the initial shingles rash , and they may decrease the prevalence and severity of PHN . The problem is that patients may delay seeking medical attention , or physicians may sometimes misdiagnose the condition early on if the rash is just beginning or not yet present . <p> Unfortunately , at this time there is n't any magic formula for preventing another flare-up of shingles . But the good news is that the disease only recurs in an estimated 1 to 5% of patients . Unlike herpes simplex , it is rather uncommon for shingles to recur repeatedly in the same person unless there is a problem with their immune system . In fact , when I see shingles again and again in the same patient , I wonder whether they may have been misdiagnosed with shingles when in fact they have herpes simplex . <p> If , as in your mom 's case , shingles has produced a case of PHN , a variety of pain medications , both oral and topical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide range of response to these treatments , so patients may need to keep trying until they find the one that 's best for them . You might suggest that your morn consult a physician who specializes in the treatment of pain . Her local hospital should be able to offer a recommendation . Research is underway to determine whether a vaccine similar to the one for chicken pox will work against shingles . Is It Contagious ? <p> Part of the common concern about shingles stems from its medical name herpes zoster , which sounds a lot like herpes simplex , a different viral disease that can be acquired through sexual contact and other means . Since both diseases produce a blister-type rash that can recur , the confusion is understandable . Let me try to clarify the contagion aspects of herpes zoster . <p> First , you do n't catch shingles from someone else . To develop it , you must have had chicken pox previously ( typically as a child ) . Then shingles develops within your own system . <p> Second , the blisters of shingles can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had chicken pox . However , a person who has never had chicken pox and who is exposed to shingles will not get shingles ; they will get chicken pox , the same way a child would if exposed to the virus for the first time . But in adults , chicken pox can be much more serious , so it 's worth avoiding exposure if you 've never had the disease . Quick Tip <p> If you suspect you have shingles , see our doctor at once . Prompt treatment cuts the risk of developing PHN . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Fight back against painful flare-ups . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Your best defense against the shingles virus is a healthy immune system . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Mark S.
