Lucy Looking back , it seems like there was n't anything remarkable about that morning , just one of what till then had been an unbroken chain of mornings like it , a long fever spell of green and summertime and damp sheets and bare skin and Ash at the center , at the heart , of everything . We 'd slept late , him spooned up tight behind me and , in the dreamlike way of those mornings , came awake with him , almost by accident , fitting himself inside me ; there was no urgency to it , only something sweet and congenial , and we lay like that , joined but motionless , for a long time before his fingers traced their way over my hipbone and I started squirming and things shifted into the next gear , as such things are wont to do . I knew he had work to do that morning - building kitchen cabinets for old Mrs. Crouch at her house in town - but there was nothing rushed in his attentions , nothing that suggested there was anywhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , his belly sweating against my back , breathing into the uncombed tangle of my hair , the two of us straining gently , then not so gently , toward some mutually agreeable conclusion . He got up , finally , and switched on the air conditioner ; even in June , Ash liked to sleep with the windows open and the warm night breeze drifting in through the screens , nothing but the blades of the ceiling fan slapping their tranquil rhythm overhead , but by ten A.M. the house was starting to stifle . He got into the shower , and I lay back against the sheets , positioning myself under the vent and allowing the cold jets of air to play across my warm , moist skin , turning it to gooseflesh . The sun through the curtains stippled my torso and thighs with , bands of lemony light , and I recall very plainly that I loved my body , marveled not just at its health and vitality , its ability to serve and to please me , but at the round symmetry of my breasts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expanse of my creamy , pink-tipped skin . I looked , I decided happily , juicy . It was no wonder Ash Farrell had been late for work every day for a month . The shower stopped , and a cloud of steam drifted in from the bathroom , and in a few seconds I heard him humming , which meant he was shaving . A few minutes later he emerged , naked , his wet hair combed off his forehead . I smiled and preened at him from the bed , and he smiled back absently as he crossed to the walk-in closet . " Ash ? " He came out stuffing the tail of a faded gray T-shirt into the waistband of his Levi 's . " Where are my boots ? " he asked , and knelt and peered under the bed . " Ash , " I said again , and he lifted his head and said , " What ? " " Do you think I 'm beautiful ? " He gave me an indulgent half smile , the kind men give their women when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't believe you have to ask me that , " he said . But I had his attention now ; I arched my back , rearranging myself among the disheveled sheets . " Do you mean beautiful in general , or now , in particular ? " He sat down carefully at the foot of the mattress . Looking , but not touching . " Either one , " I said , stretching a bare foot toward him . " Now , in particular , I guess . " " It 's a tempting display , I admit . " He looked interested but wary , like I might be trying to dupe him . " Do n't you think I look juicy ? " I pushed myself up on my elbows , nipples peaked and rosy in the stream of refrigerated air . A final assault , I let my right knee fall gently open , giving him the brunt of what , I hoped , I was talking about . Ash laughed , and stretched out his hand and wrapped it around my nearest ankle . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed my instep . " That would be you . " " Do n't go , " I said , and I think we both were surprised by the edge in my voice , that what had been playful seconds before now sounded pinched and a little desperate . He bent and nuzzled my cheek with his , freshly scraped and still smelling of shaving cream . " Mrs. Crouch is gon na fire my sorry ass , " he whispered , his breath against my mouth making me shiver . Like the search for his boots under the bed , the remark was rhetorical . How many days like this in your life do you get to count , you and another soul reaching out across the wide , dark universe and in a single point of brightness finding each other ? Ash knelt in his beat-up Levi 's over me , and I pulled him into my arms so hard I could feel the precise arrangement of bone beneath muscle , so hard I could feel our two hearts beating , chest to chest . He raised his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Luce , " he said . " What are you trying to do to me ? " But I could n't answer him . How was I supposed to put a name to what I felt ? Why were all the words so frail and insubstantial ? As long as I knew Ash , I would be looking for words to match the sensations , to declare myself with something approaching the scope of what our bodies learned to do . I let him go , and he sat up and pulled on a pair of socks , and brought his boots out from under the bed . He lifted his pager off the dresser and squinted at it . " Uh-oh , " he said . I listened to him pad down the hall in his sock feet and lift the phone out of its cradle . " Good morning , Mrs. Crouch , this is Ash Farrell . Yes , ma'am , I know I said nine o'clock and it 's ten-thirty . Yes , ma'am , but you see , those fellows down at the True Value , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your kitchen cupboards ...
