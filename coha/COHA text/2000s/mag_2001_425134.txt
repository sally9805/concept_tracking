WE CAN MAKE THE MOST OF OUR LIFE and fitness even when we enter middle age-like Ned Overend , 46 . Even though he was a pro rider , Overend feels his age . He has elbow tendonitis that he has to keep in check , and he wards off hamstring pulls and backaches with a thorough stretching regime . He knows that physically he 's slower than some of the 30-year-olds he competes against . But he has an edge : wisdom . " I certainly ride smarter now , " Overend says . " When I was younger , I 'd go to the front and trade pulls with anybody . These days I 'm more conservative . I use strategy and drafting to my advantage to be a more efficient rider . I 'm still confident , which is important too . " The confidence comes from experience . In one World Cup race , Overend was off the front with two faster , younger riders who were constantly beating him up the climbs on a series of rollers . But by accelerating on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experience also taught him to shift often and use a higher cadence to make the most of his momentum and save his energy for the long haul . With his more efficient , smarter riding he outlasted the other two riders to win that race and the 1992 World Cup . And like Overend , you also have at least four decades of muscle memory helping you pedal , and plenty of slow-twitch muscle fiber ( the last to go ) to help you ride longer ( if not faster ) . " You ca n't be out there thinking : I 'm doing pretty good for 46 years old , " ' Overend says . " You should n't put age limitations on yourself based on what other people say you should or should n't be able to do . Figure that out for yourself . " With average life expectancies in the U.S. hovering at 79 years for women and 75 for men , you 're officially starting the second lap . Do n't get sad . Check out the list of great athletic achievements by cyclists in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Record 10 years later at the age of 42 ; Gilbert Duclos-Lassalle twice won ParisRoubaix-the most damnably hard one-day race in the world-at 41 and 42 years old ; the most successful female racer in history , Jeannie Longo , who over three decades has won 12 world championships and an Olympic gold medal , and set 37 world records ( including the hour record ) , is still mixing it up at 43 . And , of course , there 's Overend , the 1998-99 X-Terra champion , current U.S. X-Terra champ and Winter National Triathlon Champion . All this despite a maximum heart rate that 's declining roughly one beat per year as muscle fiber atrophies , and peak power and sustained power fade . How can you keep improving ? It 's simple : Stoke the fire . Riding at least three times per week , for instance , helps you retain fast-twitch fibers even as you lose overall muscle . You can cut losses in your VOsub 2 max at least in half . Regular riding increases your heart 's stroke volume-how much it pumps per beat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that occurs with age . The best news is that the benefits of such exercise accrue at nearly any age . Older people respond as well or better to exercise than younger people , and continuing a lifetime of exercise has wonderful effects . One study found that peak strength in knee extensors in trained 70-year-old men was actually higher than that of sedentary subjects half their age . Overend rides four to five days a week and makes every ride count . Each has a specific purpose : One will be a fast group ride , another , an anaerobic threshold session . If he 's training for a specific event , there will be a day tailored to that race , and the remaining rides are easy recovery rides with not too much climbing . " It 's easy for riders my age who have n't got much time to ride to just go out and hammer every ride , " Overend says . " You need to vary your training to have peaks on highintensity days and valleys on recovery days . " But Overend warns the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to 40s is the time it takes to recover from intense training . " Before , I 'd do hill repeats and beat myself up until I was ragged and then recover in a few days , " Overend says . " Now , I make sure I stop doing intervals when I know I still have one good one in me . " Sidebar <p>
