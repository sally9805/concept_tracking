The practice of Tai Chi , the graceful , slow-motion progression through a series of poses  --  some call it " moving meditation "  --  is known to build up strength , agility and balance . But shingles immunity ? According to a study in the current edition of Psychosomatic Medicine , 15 weeks of Tai Chi seems to have helped protect a group of 18 elderly adults against the shingles virus ( the same virus that causes chickenpox ) . One week after the study was completed , immune-cell levels increased an average of nearly 50% in those who practiced Tai Chi , while the control group showed no improvement . The results , which will need to be confirmed by larger studies , suggest that a little Tai Chi could be of great value to the elderly , since immunity to the shingles virus weakens with age .  --  S.S.
