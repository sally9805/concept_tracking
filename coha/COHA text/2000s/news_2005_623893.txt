<p> A friend of mine once told me that she dreads holiday entertaining . <p> It has nothing to do with her party-throwing skills  --  she 's a regular Martha Stewart the other 10 1/2 months of the year . But come November , all it takes is the scent of mulling spices and the flash of twinkling lights to render her panic-stricken . <p> She blames the competition . <p> " People are usually itching for a social engagement on a random April weekend , " she says , " but in December , you 're lucky if you choose a date that has n't already been claimed by three other people . The competition to throw the best party is fierce . " And , she declared , it 's virtually impossible if you are confined to a mere 800 square feet . <p> Since moving to San Francisco , I 've begun to understand her problem . We live in small spaces . When it comes to holiday entertaining , I ca n't just invite my three favorite couples for an intimate dinner party at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls ' night , with six of us crammed on one couch sharing a tub of ice cream . My holiday soiree is the one time of the year when my door is opened  --  I feel obligated to invite my whole address book . <p> In theory , it 's a lovely concept . But it requires creativity and planning to keep a small apartment full of people comfortable , happy and well fed . <p> Keep ' em moving <p> I 've found the best way to function in a small space is to keep the traffic flowing . Rather than arrange a buffet in the biggest room , which will only result in all of your guests loitering around one table , use every appropriate room in the house . <p> Translation : Areas where you sleep and brush your teeth do not qualify . That leaves the kitchen , the living room , maybe a dining room and , if you 're lucky , an extra nook  --  a foyer , patio or sunroom . <p> When it comes to food , I like to focus on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up instantly . Small plates work beautifully . <p> In restaurants , chefs long ago discovered the benefits of these tiny dishes . More filling than appetizers , diners can craft an entire meal off the small-plates menu . They 're perfect for sharing , are great conversation starters , and they 're gone before the customer has a chance to get bored with them . <p> In short , they 're the perfect party food . <p> The best way to serve small plates in your small space is to divide the plates by room . One dish in the living room , another in the dining room and a third in the kitchen means that as guests tire of one , they 'll naturally flow to the next room . Think of it as a progressive dinner , but in the confines of your own home . It keeps guests spread out , social and interested . <p> As I plan the menu , I try not to limit myself to one cuisine . While I know a tapas and sangria party might be a hit , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll focus on different ethnic flavors for each room . One , for example , will have an Italian bent , with small plates of shrimp topped with vodka sauce . In another , the Asian flavors of an ahi poke salad with sesame soy dressing will entice guests , served in little lettuce cups . <p> I ca n't completely ignore tapas , the original small plate , so in the kitchen I 'll have plates consisting of **26;4961;TOOLONG potatoes . And my less adventurous friends will love filet mignon skewers . Mexican chocolate brownies with cinnamon whipped cream will be a crowd pleaser for dessert . <p> Figuring out the best way to serve these plates becomes the only dilemma . Ideally , I 'd recruit some friends to come early so I have some help in the kitchen . If you live in a small space , chances are you do n't have 50 small dishes in your cabinet , so finding nice disposable dishes is key . Pick up a package of sturdy , appetizer-size plates , and as guests finish each one , they can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaning up a breeze . <p> The accompanying recipes include plating instructions , which can be done quickly just before the party starts . If you have one small table in each room , guests can pick up a plate as they flow between rooms . Alternately , you can serve the dishes family style , and guest can fill their own small plates . <p> Make ahead or potluck <p> This type of party works just as well as a potluck , so take your friends up on their offers when they ask what to bring . Knowing that one guest will be in charge of the dining room 's dish will make your life easier . Your only job will be to supply the plates . <p> If you 're taking on the entire challenge , most elements of these recipes can be made ahead . The potatoes , for example , can be stuffed and refrigerated the night before . Simply heat them in the oven until warmed through , and finish them under the broiler . <p> The vodka sauce , balsamic reduction , garlic aioli and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit , so it 's wise to make them at least one day in advance . <p> You can even thread the skewers the night before , and keep them tightly wrapped in the fridge . <p> It still leaves a busy party day , with time spent cooking , plating and cleaning . But that 's to be expected when you 're attempting to throw the best holiday party of the bunch . <p> Ready to get started ? Go claim your date . Time is running out . <p> If you 're worried that one small plate in each room wo n't satisfy your guests , you can put out some store-bought items that are easy to arrange . Based on this small plates menu , here are a few ideas , all of which would also work on their own . <p> With the Lettuce Cups With Ahi Poke Salad :  --  Toast macadamia nuts and place them in small bowls .  --  Buy ready-to-eat edamame , either from a Japanese restaurant or gourmet grocery store . Do n't forget to put out an extra bowl for empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and pick up a few orders of dumplings . Either arrange on a plate with a bowl of soy sauce for dipping , or buy a package of wonton spoons , and place one dumpling per spoon with a few drops of soy sauce . Arrange spoons on a platter . <p> With the Chorizo &; Pepper Stuffed Potatoes :  --  Go to a cheesemonger and ask for an assortment of Spanish cheeses . Arrange on a plate with crackers and breads.  --  Put out bowls full of Marcona almonds and Spanish olives , which can be purchased at Whole Foods or other gourmet grocery stores .  --  On a platter , arrange thin slices of Serrano ham , chorizo and other cured Spanish meats . <p> With the Shrimp With Vodka Sauce :  --  Cut coarse chunks of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese , and arrange on a platter with thin slices of prosciutto . Serve with crackers and breads.  --  Stop by an Italian deli and pick up assorted antipasto , including marinated mushrooms , peppers and artichokes .  --  Slice French bread and toast to make crostini . Top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> With the Filet Mignon Skewers With <p> Balsamic Reduction :  --  Put out any extra balsamic reduction , along with a bowl of olive oil and a bowl of sea salt . Cut slices of fresh bread , and arrange with assorted vegetables like blanched asparagus.  --  Set out a platter of radishes , with soft butter and sea salt .  --  Cut up chives and mix with store-bought crme fraiche .
