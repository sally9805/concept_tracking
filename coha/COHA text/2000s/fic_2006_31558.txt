Chapter One With the sluggish winter sun hanging low in the gray sky , Detective Parker Ross dragged himself out of his salt-and-slush-covered car . Howling wind shoved against him , jerking the car door from his hand to slam it shut . His dress shoes slipped on the icy blacktop and he almost lost his footing . The frozen parking lot echoed his muttered curse . Cautiously , he started forward , taking in the depressing sight of his apartment building . The landlord 's attempts at decorating had left bedraggled strands of colored lights haphazardly tossed over the barren , neglected bushes that served as landscaping . Some of the bulbs had blown , while others blinked in a drunken hiccup . On the ground near the walkway , a dented plastic snowman lay on its side , half-covered in brownish slush , cigarette butts , and scraps of garbage . Damn , but he 'd be glad when the holidays passed and life returned to normal . Slinging his soiled suit coat over his shoulder , his head down in exhaustion , Parker trudged along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an overcoat with him because the last perp he 'd tangled with had destroyed it . Weariness and disgust kept him from noting the frozen snowflakes thatgathered on the back of his neck ; after such a bitch of a day , even the frigid December weather could n't revive him . A hot shower , some nuked food , and sleep-that 's all he needed , in that exact order . Once he hit the sheets , he intended to stay there for a good ten hours . He had the next week off , and he did n't want to do anything more involved than camping on his couch and watching football . God knew he deserved a rest . The past month of holiday-evoked lunacy and criminal desperation had left him little time for relaxation . Parker saw Christmas as lavish , loud , and downright depressing . With his planned time off , he intended to hide out and avoid the nonsense . Now , if he could just slip into his apartment without Lily Donaldson catching him ... Thinking of Lily sent a flood of warmth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen weather could n't . He was old enough to know better , but no matter how he tried , Lily tempted him . She also infuriated him . She aroused his curiosity , and his tenderness . She made him think , and she made him hot . She had trouble written all over her . He wanted to be all over her . In the ten months he 'd known her , Lily had influenced his life far too often . Smart , kind , gentle . She carried food to Mrs. Harbinger when the old lady fell ill . She argued sound politics with fanatical Mr. Pitnosky . Both intelligent and astute , Lily smiled at everyone , never gossiped , and had a generous heart . She loved Christmas , which rubbed him raw . And she had a terrible case of hero worship . That was the hardest thing to deal with . Parker knew he did n't possess a single ounce of heroism . If he did , then resisting her would n't be so damn difficult . In a hundred different ways , Lily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But her age made him wary , her enthusiasm scared him to death , and her love of a holiday he scorned showed they had little in common . On top of all that , he had serious doubts about her occupation . Yep , a conundrum for sure . Parker hated to think about it , yet he thought about it far too often . Not once had he ever noticed any work routine for Lily . Sure , she left her apartment , but not dressed for anything other than a real good time . Always made up . Always decked out , dressed for seduction . Sometimes she left early , sometimes late . Sometimes she stayed gone for days , and some days she never left the apartment at all . But that did n't stop a steady stream of admirers from calling on her . The only reason Parker could tolerate that situation was because the guys seldom lasted more than a few hours , never more than a day . Whatever Lily did to support herself , she sure as hell did n't punch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her job a couple of times , but she always turned evasive and changed the subject , leaving Parker with few conclusions to draw . He was a selfish bastard who refused to share , so even if the other roadblocks did n't exist , no way could he let their friendship grow into intimacy . That did n't mean he could keep his mind off her . Throughout the awful day-hell , the awful month-thoughts of Lily made the hours more bearable . He imagined her sweet smile , the special one she saved for him . He imagined that deep admiration in her eyes whenever she looked at him . He imagined her lush bod , minus the sexy clothes she wore . Seeing her now would shove him right over the edge . Avoiding her was the smart thing to do . He planned to duck inside as fast as his drained body would allow . If she knocked , and he knew she would , he 'd pretend he was n't home . After rubbing his bloodshot eyes , he opened the entrance door to the apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wake-and still he heard her husky voice , raised in ire . Shit . With no way to reach his front door , Parker paused by the mailboxes and listened . Lily 's usually sweet voice held a sharp edge of annoyance . She probably had another smitten swain who did n't want to take no for an answer . Peering out the glass entrance doors , Parker considered a strategic retreat . Maybe he could drop by a bar and get a beer . Or visit his mother-no , scratch that . His mom would start trying to rope him in for a big family get-together , caroling , or God-knew-what-other holiday function . Maybe he could ... Lily 's voice grew more insistent , and Parker 's protective instincts kicked in . Damn it , even if it fed her goofy misconceptions about him being heroic , he could n't let some bozo hassle her . Giving up on the idea of escape , Parker trod the steps to the second floor . Halfway up he saw her , and he forgot to breathe . A soft white sweater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snowflake design brushed her shoulders . Soft jeans accentuated a deliciously rounded ass . Previously spent body parts perked up in attention . Nothing new there . No matter what Parker 's brain tried to insist , his dick refused to pay attention . Lily 's pale blonde hair , pinned up but with long tendrils teasing her nape and cheeks , gave the illusion that a lover had just finished with her . Heavily lashed brown eyes defied any innocence . And her bare feet somehow made her look half-naked . His heart picked up speed , sending needed blood flow into his lethargic muscles . Predictably enough , he went from exhausted to horny in a nanosecond . Vibrating with annoyance , Lily stood just outside her apartment . A fresh , decorated wreath hung from her door , serving as a festive backdrop . Lily loved the holiday . And he loathed it . But for now , he could n't let that matter . Lily had a problem . She had a dispute . She had ... a guy on his knees ? Parker blinked in surprise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More specifically , they involved Lily rejecting men . But a begging guy ? That was a first . Glued to his spot on the stairs , Parker stared , and listened . " It was not a date , Clive . Not ever . No way . I made that clear . " " But we had lunch , " Clive insisted , reaching out to grasp her knee . " Just the two of us . " While stepping back , out of reach , Lily exclaimed , " I picked up the bill ! " Clive crawled after her . " But I would have . " She slapped his hands away . " I did n't let you-because it was not a date . " " Lily , " he moaned . " I thought we had something special . " " Tuna fish on rye is not special , Clive . Now get up . " At her surly reply , Parker bit back a smile . Lily excelled in brokenhearted boyfriends , and this guy looked very brokenhearted . Poor schmuck . As Clive obediently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her gaze . The surprise in her brown eyes softened to pleasure ; she gave him a silly , relieved smile-expecting him to heroically save the day . And Parker supposed he would . He 'd taken one step toward her when good old Clive threw his arms around her . " I love you ! " " Oh , puh-lease . " Lily shoved against him , but Clive would n't let go . " I do , " he insisted . " Let me show you how much . " Glancing toward Parker , Lily said , " Do n't be stupid , Clive . I know why you 're here . " Parker knew why , too . Lily was sexy and sweet , and Clive wanted in her pants . " You 're after my money , " Lily stated , causing Parker to do a double take . " Lily , no ! " Clive cried . " You 're broke , Clive . I know all about your business going under , the losses you 've sustained . " " Temporary setbacks , I swear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could shore you back up . " She leaned away from Clive 's hold . " Noooo . " Clive tugged her close again . Straightening her arms to hold Clive off , Lily looked at Parker . " Well , do n't just stand there . " Smirking , Parker took the remaining steps to the landing and caught Clive by the back of his coat . Because he was tired and annoyed-and damn it , he did n't like seeing other men slobbering on Lily-Parker rattled him . " The lady said to leave . " For good measure , he shook Clive again before setting him several feet away from Lily . " Now beat it . " Flustered , Clive straightened his coat with righteous anger . " Who the hell are you ? " " Just a neighbor . " " Then this does n't concern you . " Given his height of six feet four , Parker had the advantage of looking down on most people , especially shorter people like Clive . " I 'm a cop . I 've had a shitty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to back up . " I 've dealt with a three-car pileup . Got knocked into a damn curb full of blackened slush by a mob of happy shoppers . Got jumped by a crazy woman stealing a bike for her kid . Had to break up a riot during a VCR sale . And wrestled with a goon robbing Santa of donations for the homeless . I am not in the mood to tell you twice . " Clive gulped . " I just need to explain to her ... " " She 's not interested in your explanations . " Lily moved to stand beside Parker . " No , I 'm not . " She curled her arms around one of his for no reason that Parker could find . She did that a lot . If she spoke to him , she touched him-almost as if she could n't help herself . And it drove him nuts . " All right . " Dejected , Clive fashioned a puppy-dog face . " But you 're making a mistake , Lily . I do love you . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stairs like a man on the way to the gallows . When the door closed behind Clive , Parker mustered up his good sense and peeled Lily 's hands off his arm . " Good night , Lily . " He headed for his door . " Good night ? " She hustled after him . " But ... what do you mean , ' good night ' ? " " I 'm beat . It 's been a hell of a day . " Parker refused to look at her . Just being near her made him twitchy in the pants . If he looked at her , he 'd be a goner . " Sounds like . " She scuttled in front of him , blocking his way . " I never realized that detectives got into so many physical confrontations . " That damned admiring tone weakened his resolve . " It 's the holidays . " He could n't help but look at her , and once he did , he could n't look away . " It brings out the worst in everyone . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " His day had been just bad enough to shatter his resolve . He wanted to vent . To Lily . Somehow , he knew she 'd understand . To disguise his level of emotion , Parker snorted . " The wreck I mentioned ? It sent two innocent people to the hospital . " Concern clouded her beautiful eyes . " I 'm so sorry to hear that . " " I got called in because the arresting officer found psilocybin mushrooms in the car of the idiot who caused the wreck . Enough to know he 's a dealer . " " Hallucinogenic drugs , " Lily breathed , surprising Parker . " How terrible . Will the victims be all right ? " Parker eyed her . What the hell did Lily know about mushrooms ? " I do n't know , " he grouched . " Last I heard , the woman was in surgery . " She had two kids who 'd be counting on her to be there Christmas morning . Parker hoped like hell she made it . " The dealer ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll see to him , I 'm sure . " Parker ground his teeth together , pissed off all over again . Lily sounded so confident in his ability . " I 'd already arrested him once on a charge of manufacturing methamphetamine , but he failed to appear in court . At least this should cinch a conviction . " Lily inched closer , her expression sympathetic , her mood nurturing . " Your job is n't often an easy one , is it ? " Damn , she looked sweet and soft , and far too appealing . Parker cleared his throat . " Look , Lily , I 'm beat . I do n't want to talk about work . " He did n't want to tempt himself with her . " I need to get some shut-eye . " Her hand settled over his , her fingers warm and gentle . " At least let me explain about Clive . " Cocking a brow , Parker said , " It was pretty self-explanatory . " Leaning on the wall beside his door , her gaze somber , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harbored an infatuation . He said he wanted to talk about business , my schedule was clear ... " She shut down on that real fast . " It was not an intimate lunch . " The nature of their business made Parker 's stomach roil . " So you said . " " I guess you got an earful , huh ? " She did n't sound all that embarrassed . " He lied to me , Parker , saying he wanted to help with a project of mine , telling me he wanted to be friends . Can you believe his nerve ? " " The world is full of creeps , Lily . " What project ? No , he did n't care . " Good night . " Lily 's voice dropped . " It 's barely six o'clock . " Sticking his key in the lock , Parker tried to ignore her nearness . An impossible task . " I 've been up over twenty-four hours . I ca n't see straight anymore . Fast as I can get a shower and find some food , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He stepped inside ... Lily followed . " Poor baby . " She touched him again , this time on his right biceps . Even through his shirt , Parker felt the tingling jolt that shot through his system and fired up his gonads . She might as well have grabbed his crotch for the way it affected him . Unaware of his rioting libido , Lily said , " I feel terrible that you got pulled into the middle of my mess after all you 've been through today . " Before he could censor himself , Parker said , " It 's getting to be a habit . " Lily tilted her head and smiled . " I can think of worse habits than drawing your attention . " Please do n't go there . " Sorry . " Parker ran a hand over the knotted muscles in his neck . " I did n't mean that the way it sounded . " " I understand . I ... I do seem to have a bad track record with guys . " " Lily ... " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ explain , she brightened her smile and changed the subject . " Now that Clive 's gone , why do n't you let me thank you with dinner ? " Parker took a step back , then stopped to curse himself . Damn it , since when did women have him retreating like a green kid in middle school ? Since Lily had moved in-smelling , looking , probably tasting like sex . His body flinched in excitement , and he quickly steered his thoughts in a new direction . " That 's all right . I 'll just grab a sandwich or something . " " I have plenty of fresh leftovers . Fixing you a plate of ham and potato salad wo n't take any longer than making a sandwich . " Coy , Lily ducked her head , and one long blonde curl fell over her breast . " Besides , today is my birthday . " Ah , shit . " Yeah ? " And he heard himself say , " So are you legal yet ? " The second the words left his mouth , Parker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Lily said , gazing up at him in adoration , " I 've been legal for a while . I 'm twenty-four now . " So it was n't as bad as he 'd told himself . He still felt ancient . At thirty-eight , he was old enough to be her ... older brother . " My folks are on vacation , " Lily continued , and she took a tiny step forward , full of entreaty . " They wo n't get home till Christmas morning . My friends are all with their families . I do n't have anyone to celebrate with-but now you 're home . " Just the thought of spending the night with Lily had Parker 's heart dropping to his stomach . With anticipation . " Really , Lily , I 'm shot . I 'd be lousy company . " " You do n't have to entertain me . " Peculiar desperation clawed at him . If he ever had her , he would n't want to let her go . But the roadblocks all remained . " I need a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approval , lingering on his belt buckle , then the open collar of his shirt . Parker felt his nostrils flare at her interest , and knew he fought a losing battle . " I think you look ... fine . " Coming from her mouth , fine sounded like the greatest flattery .
