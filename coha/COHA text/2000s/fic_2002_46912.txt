Rod Garcia first introduced us to the world of Markovy in " The Iron Wood " ( Aug. 2000 ) and returned to it in " Death in Love " ( Jan. 2002 ) . No need to reread those stories in order to follow the compelling action here , but if a name or two sounds familiar , you 'll know where you encountered them before . Mr. Garcia 's work usually takes us places we 've never been . With this new story , someone who knows the intimate secrets of Haram life will have to notify us if there were any errors made here . <p> THE RED STAIR SEAMSTRESSES RACED DEATH to sew Aria into her cloth-of-silver gown . Female dwarves stitched the hems . Ladies  --  in-waiting did the sleeves and bodice . Pearl trim , silver pins , and ermine scraps lay strewn about the carpeted floor . Fingers and needles worked frantically over Aria 's body - but not fast enough . She stood half-dressed when a flustered maidservant burst into the tower chamber , announcing an armored messenger . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover up . Knowing fear would surely kill her , she assumed a superior air , frowning at the man 's muddy boots . He stood and gawked . Young and nobly bred , he had never set foot in the Haram before , and never realized that an unmarried princess wore nothing under her closest fitting dresses . She let him look , standing hip deep in dwarves , draped in long black hair and cloth-of-silver , with one white thigh bared to the hip . Hopefully it would give him courage . Young men did things out of desire that neither gold nor duty could move them to do . Collecting himself , the startled blond lordling dropped to one knee , assuming the self-important eagerness of a man with bad tidings . " Your Highness , I am Lord Valad d'Hay . I bring grave news . " " And ruin to my Barbary rugs . " Which were brilliant pieces , hand woven with golden thread , having come half a year by caravan . Aria motioned to her women . " Take off his boots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay hands on handsome young Lord d'Hay . Nothing distracts a man in armor like smiling young females bending down and seizing his legs . DHay rose awkwardly , stammering out his message as her women lifted one leg , then the other , tugging off his heavy cavalry boots . " Prince Akavarr has come . With his boyars . And in armor . " " As are you , " Aria reminded him . He wore the half-armor of a light horseman-gorget , cuirass , steel gauntlets , mail sleeves , and plate tassets on his thighs . " And armed , " d'Hay added gravely . " Naturally . " He might as well have said they were wearing pants . No boyar would so much as stagger drunk to the privy without some sort of edged steel at hand - not willingly , at least . It was what separated them from serfs . Common Markovites could own nothing more dangerous than pitchforks and carving knives . Boyars had swords and armor and armed retainers , and the power of pit and gallows - they would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stupid . Ever since she was a girl - when her mother was put away and she started following her father about - Aria had been surrounded by overarmed men . As a child she moved among swords and dirks belted at her eye level , knowing half the men who wore them wished her dead . Unnerving , but Aria had learned to live with it . " The guards at the Bishop 's Gate have gone over to him . They will be here within the hour . " Aria sighed . Her voice could be musical , even when scared . Her foreign-sounding name meant " song " in the forbidden language of the opera . " And they expect an audience ? " " Highness , Prince Akavarr means to take you . " " Impossible . " She tilted her dark head to let him get the full effect . Maids adjusted her ermine mantle . " Today is Saint Zelda 's Day , devoted to prayer and repentance , so I may see no one . Please , tell him so. // Dwarf seamstresses tittered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serving women handed him his boots . He bowed and left , in clanking half-armor and stocking feet . She turned back to her women , saying with pretended seriousness , " I fear we will have to feed young Lord d'Hay to the horses . " Giggling broke the tension , and everyone worked all the faster for having someone to laugh at . Just getting dressed to die was horribly timeconsuming ; each piece of the gown fit so perfectly it had to be sewn on . Such a gown came off the same way , one piece at a time . For a noblewoman to conduct an affair she needed more than bravery and a willing gallant ; successful adultery demanded the services of a clever maid , a discreet seamstress , and a dwarf to stand lookout . Everything Aria did required a change of costume , a silk chemise to sleep in , a surcoat and sable mantle for the morning , a riding dress if she went out , a green-and-gold gown for supper , purple or cloth-of-silver for state occasions , red damask for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executed , that too must be dressed for , a black gown with crimson lining if it was to be a beheading , a plain linen shift if she was burned alive . An informal strangling or suffocation would be come-as-you-are . Ladies of the chamber placed the royal tiara on her head just as Lord d'Hay returned - this time carrying his boots . " Your Highness , Prince Akavarr and his boyars are inside . The palace guards gave way to them . " Aria motioned her dwarves aside , saying , " What do you think ? " D'Hay looked puzzled - not expecting to be consulted in a crisis . " Your Highness should call out the Gendarmes of the Guard . Backed by the Kazaks , they could hold the Red Stairs until ..... " Aria smiled at d'Hay 's sincerity , studying him in a serving girl 's mirror . Boys like him , so in love with honor and bravery , renewed her faith in men . " I mean what do you think of my gown ? " He gaped like a hooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Stunning , Your Highness . Truly stunning . " Aria saw he meant it . " Good . " She grinned into the mirror . " You may go . " D'Hay obeyed . Her women giggled again as he left , having marked the boy down as bold and amorous . Aria felt fortified , glad he approved of her gown . Male approval meant everything today - literally a life or death matter . And sometimes all men seemed to care about was her clothes , and how she looked in them . And how to get them off her - never caring about her thoughts or feelings . Women , even princesses , were ignorant , sinful , vessels for making babies , immune to education and prone to promiscuity - hence the Haram . Certainly no one asked her opinion on foreign affairs , Church reform , or the uncertain future of Markovy . Now Prince Akavarr meant to take any such weighty matters entirely out of her hands , and an impending coup d'etat was at least as important as a court reception . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the pantry girls and candle bearers , were dressed in black and silver for the occasion , to match her hair and gown . Sable et argent , elegant yet solemn , her personal colors . The Haram was a woman 's castle , and finery her armor . Now that castle faced a siege , and Aria meant to confront her foes looking like she stepped down off of a cloud , not like she crawled out from behind a couch . She left her private apartments , followed by her handmaids . Shafts of morning sun filtered through the Haram 's narrow light wells , leaded windows , and arabesque screens . Live birds flitted through the halls and doorways , singing in alarm . Dwarves peeked around corners as they passed . Each hallway had its own color scheme ; one would be royal blue , with sky-colored carpets , and turquoise tapestries bordered with cornflowers , while the next would be dark red , with burgundy hangings , alcove candles , and carpets colored with dragon 's blood . Bishop Peter Petrovich of Markov waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Church in purple robes and golden miter . He carried a tall gold and steel bishop 's crosier heavy enough to use as a club . For a seventy-year-old eunuch , Bishop Peter was still full of divine fire , ready to stand by Aria at the death . She bowed before him , feeling Bishop Peter 's hand on her head , just as when she was little . He called her daughter - the only one who did so now that her father was dead . " Kneel before Heaven , daughter , and confess your sins . " Instantly she was ten again ; only the sins had changed . " Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . I have not lied or blasphemed since my last confession . Nor have I fornicated , but I lusted after a man in my heart . And this morning a man saw my thigh . I skipped prayers two bedtimes in a row , and I played at magic , seeking to see my future in cards . I listened to profane music and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in my heart , though only Heaven heard me . " Women whispered behind her while she waited for absolution , wondering who she lusted after . Bishop Peter lifted his hand , signing in the air above her head . " Rise , my daughter , and be blessed . You face penance enough for your sins . " Perhaps . Chastity and prayer had not forestalled Prince Akavarr , but they let her face him with a lighter heart . No matter what she had done , no matter what lies were told about her , Aria did not feel sinful . She lied when she had to - but that could not be helped . And she never understood why music and dancing were mortal sins , while getting beastly drunk and whipping the clothes off serving girls or setting fire to a dwarf were harmless pastimes . The ways of the Almighty were ever a mystery  --  especially to her . But she was grateful for confession , which always made her feel cleansed . She rose and kissed the Bishop 's fleshy hand , asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prince Ivan , her small blond six-year-old halfbrother . Being a boy , and heir to the throne , his surcoat was cloth-of-gold . She took her half-brother 's hand , saying , " Send for Sister Karinana . " If the family faced death , they would do it together . Bishop Peter walked before her , holding his crosier and swinging a censer , blessing the path ahead . Ivan clung to her hand , terrified , though he had the least to fear . Prince Akavarr would happily slaughter the lot of them just to lay hands on Ivan - but try to explain that to a frightened child . D'Hay appeared again , out of breath from going back and forth in armor . He knelt before the Bishop , touching his forehead , then knelt again before Aria and Prince Ivan . " Highnesses , they are at the foot of the Red Stairs - the Gendarmes of the Guard have not stopped them . " Aria nodded ; that was what came of not giving herself to her guard captain . She thanked d'Hay , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young d'Hay throwing himself away in some futile attempt to defend her . " Wait for us here . Though I know that shall be hard for you . " D'Hay rose , looking like he might not do it ; then his gaze dropped and he stepped back . " As you say , m'lady , it will be hard . " M'lady ? Here is a bold boy . What became of " Your Highness ? " Bare a bit of thigh in a crisis and suddenly she was m'lady . At least he still obeyed . Ever since she was little , people had done what she wanted , when she wanted it . Her greatest terror was that the power to command was about to be taken away , and after today people would no longer do as she said . She would become an ordinary woman - to be ordered about , whipped and set to work , then forced into marriage or a nunnery as occasion demanded . Aria would far rather be dead . Fear clutched her heart as she approached the Red Stairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'Hay perhaps . Small good that would do . Kazak bowmen crowded the porch at the head of the stairs , smelling of sweat and spoiled butter , gripping their composite bows ; unable to speak a civilized tongue , they would not know whom to shoot . The Gendarmes of the Guard were drawn up at the foot of the stairs in their silver-chased armor , but by now they were bound to be under Prince Akavarr 's spell . Aria could not imagine them turning their poleaxes against a prince of the blood , backed by dozens of boyars , not unless she gave them some incredibly good reason . Gargoyles crouched on the balcony rail , staring down at the open audience hall two full stories beneath them . Looking past their stone faces into the hall below , all she saw at first were bared blades - the boyars , drawn swords , the Gendarmes " poleaxes , and the guards " halberds . A hedge of edged steel seemed to fill the audience hall , bright and terrifying . Kings had died on these stairs - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pikes of rioting peasants . Legend had it that the steps were carpeted with red so as not to show blood . Hisses rose from below , along with shouts of " witch " and " whore " it took a moment to realize that they meant her . Standing still as a silver statue at the head of the Red Stairs , Aria fought to cast out fear . Fear eroded you , making you plain and ordinary , and Aria wanted there to be nothing ordinary about her . That was why she stood before her enemies wearing a gown worth more than most Markovites saw in a lifetime , yet looking nearly naked , every curve exposed by cloth-of-silver . Beneath her silver , ermine , and pearls , was her mortal body - a woman 's body , weak and willful - covered by a gown costing ten thousand ducats , topped with a diamond tiara worth a queen 's ransom . Prince Akavarr stepped up on the stairs , wearing half-armor and a mail cowl . Blocked by Bishop Peter swinging his censer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harlot . " Boyars began to chant , " Jez-be-bel , jez-e-bel , Jez-e-be-bel , Jez-e-bel ..... Calling her by the name of the witch-queen in the Book of Kings . Aria stared hard at the harsh bearded faces of the men who had destroyed her mother . Akavarr was her uncle , her father 's half-brother , barred from the throne for being a bastard , but still an old-time prince of the blood , big , bearded and unwashed , who ate with his hands , drank with his boyars , and hated her with all his heart . He had never reconciled himself to his half-brother 's foreign marriage - to a wife who refused to hide in the Haram , who dared bring minstrels and play-acting to the palace . And he never saw the need for a niece who dared to share her mother 's looks and disposition . When ten years of frivolous marriage produced only a daughter , Akavarr led the boyars in demanding that Aria 's mother be set aside . Father capitulated . Her mother was sent off with shaved head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ convent . " Let her dance and frolic to four stone walls , " Akavarr sneered . Father then married a God-fearing girl from a good boyar family . Years passed . Aria grew up . Finally Father 's second marriage produced a living son - little Prince Ivan cowering behind her . Having gotten an heir , Father promptly packed his second wife off to a convent , and recalled Aria 's mother , enraging his boyars . Aria had been ecstatic , staying up all night , running her hands through her mother 's short graying hair , exchanging memories of the years they had missed , then just watching over Mother while she slept . Aria ended up sleeping until noon the next day - but it was worth it . When she got up , her mother was dead , poisoned at breakfast along with her two favorite handmaids . Only Aria 's sleeping late had saved her . Now that both her mother and father were dead , Prince Akavarr meant to complete the task , finishing off her family - if not by outright murder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some convent cell , or walled up in a Haram tower . Her mother 's foreign blood made Aria hated , but her father 's blood condemned her . Once he had Ivan in his hands , Akavarr could not risk her producing another heir . She heard old Bishop Peter raising his reedy voice against the multitude , crying , " For shame ! For shame ! " He stood in front of the armed Prince , shaking his censer . " Why have you violated the sanctity of the palace ? " Taken aback , Prince Akavarr had not expected the reverend Bishop to side with Ivan 's wicked half-sister - but he quickly recovered , shouting even louder . " We have come to assure the safety of the heir . " He pointed a mailed finger at her . " She means to supplant Prince Ivan with a child of her vice . " Aria stared at the man , thinking he must be entirely mad . Unable to help herself , she laughed aloud , a high musical laugh just like her voice . Scared as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembering all she had gone through to keep from getting with child . Atop the normal fears a young woman felt at having a man possess her , Aria had the certain knowledge that her child would be a prize of state - immediately seized and used to replace her . Any heir of her body was vastly preferable to Aria herself , being more easily manipulated and less tainted by foreign blood ; having a daughter would be dangerous ; a boy would be her death sentence . Men had cursed the importance she had put on not getting pregnant , and only her status as a princess kept several of them from using violence to overcome her scruples . Laughing high and long at Prince Akavarr 's absurd suggestion , she barely believed that her royal uncle had things so utterly wrong . Her laughter was magical , shattering the tension , giving her sudden courage . Everyone stared at her , boyars , Gendarmes , ladies and priests , guards and dwarves , bewildered Kazaks - all wondering what on earth she had to laugh at . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You know you do , " Akavarr shot back . " Then ask him . " She reached behind her and lifted up Ivan in his cloth-of-gold gown . Her tiny terrified half-brother clung hard to her , blue eyes wide , horrified by the scene below . Men stared back at her , nonplussed . The boyars " whole purpose had been to " protect " the heir , who now clung to his worst enemy , the scheming foreign half-sister who plotted to put her ill-gotten seed upon the throne . And both of them were protected by the Bishop of Markov . What had seemed so simple when Prince Akavarr was marching on the palace turned out to be no easy task . Baron Tolstoy , a tall , balding , long-nosed boyar with shaggy black eyebrows and thin lips , stepped forward . He was Akavarr 's brother-in-law and chief supporter , married to the Prince 's sister . Leaning past the Bishop , his armor rattling , Tolstoy asked , " How can we know that is really Prince Ivan ? " Aria laughed again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the heir from a distance , on state occasions like her father 's funeral . She saw Ivan every day . Since his mother had been put away , Ivan had been brought up by the Haram . As his closest and youngest relative , much of that bringing up had fallen to Aria - much more than she liked when he was an anxious , petulant two-year-old whining for his mother . What an absurdity . After virtually ignoring him since birth , they were asking the evil stepsister , " Is this really our prince ? " Striding boldly down the stairs until she was close enough to smell the beer on Tolstoy 's breath , she smiled triumphantly , holding the boy up so the whole hall could hear him . " Tell them your name . " Her boldness and laughter encouraged him . Hiding his tears , he grinned shyly , saying to her , " I am Prince Ivan . " Aria tickled him , making him laugh as well . " Say it louder . For them . " She pointed at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am Prince Ivan . " Then he hid back in Aria 's arms . She stroked his head , telling the heir to Markovy he had done well . Bishop Peter brought his crosier down , barring the steps , saying to Tolstoy , " Of course he is the heir . just as I am patriarch of Markov . By the Grace of God , who did you expect to find in the palace ? " Tolstoy stepped back , stymied . Prince Akavarr pushed past his vacillating brother-in-law , saying , " The heir belongs in our hands . " Aria looked at him , then at the hesitant boyars behind him , and at the uneasy Gendarmes of the Guard . Behind her on the balcony , women in cloth-of-silver stood beside Kazaks in skins and leather . Dwarves perched on the gargoyles . All eyes were on them - which was her sole advantage . Prince Akavarr plotted her mother 's death in secret , with just his creatures around him , then he resorted to poison to hide his hand . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of God and witnesses . She lifted Ivan up again . " Do you want to stay with me , or go with these men ? " Ivan shrank back , horrified , grabbing at her arms . " With you , Aria . With you . " She took the frightened boy back to her breast , calming and comforting him . She desperately hoped Akavarr would back down , announce himself satisfied , then retreat to his lair to plot more mischief . Instead she saw him spin about to harangue the wavering boyars . Staring in wonder at his armored back , and listening to his shouts , Aria realized this was foolish of him . Tolstoy had been drinking ; probably Akavarr had too , to fortify himself for the coup . He should either have given in , or stormed past the helpless old Bishop with his blade drawn . There are times when men must use either their feet or their swords . Talking for them can be fatal . Aria watched him argue with Tolstoy , upbraiding the reluctant baron , cursing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered haughtily , unused to swallowing insults . Then in an act of absolute lunacy , Akavarr shoved him scornfully , pushing him lightly on the breastplate with the gloved palm of his left hand . There was no flesh to flesh contact , but Aria saw at once it was a terrible mistake . Drunk and excited , Tolstoy instinctively clapped his hand to his sword , which he had sheathed while talking to Ivan , his legal sovereign . Akavarr 's sword was already out . Hitting his brother-in-law in the face with the hilt , he knocked Baron Tolstoy backward onto the stairs . Akavarr stood over the fallen baron , blade bared , staring down at Tolstoy who lay bleeding from the lip . Aria knew her uncle had gone way too far , assaulting one of the Nine Barons , and one of his biggest backers . Did he really mean to kill Baron Tolstoy ? Akavarr 's own brother-in-law ? On his back , with his hands empty ? In front of the patriarch and the heir apparent ? Even the boyars would be bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tolstoy would be up and at him , blade in hand . God alone knew what would come of that . Giving him no time to think his way out of the impasse , she cried out at the top of her voice , " Treason . Treason . He means to kill Baron Tolstoy . " Her women took up the chant , " Treason . Treason . Treason ..... Even Ivan yelled it , " Treason . Treason . " A terrible word to shout in that charged situation . Akavarr gave ground , anxious to defuse the situation . Tolstoy bounded to his feet , drunkenly determined to get blood for blood . Drawing his sword , he slashed clumsily at Akavarr . Forced to defend himself , Prince Akavarr parried , trying to make himself heard above the chanting . He batted Tolstoy 's sword aside , but dared not strike . Aria could see from his face he wished none of this was happening . Stumbling backward , Tolstoy tripped on the steps , going down on one knee , crying vigorously for help . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be called accomplices to Prince Akavarr 's treason . Poleaxes lashed out . One clanged off the prince 's gorget , slashing him across the jaw . Akavarr groaned and went down , his beard splattered with blood . More blades descended , hacking at his armored body . Once he was down , the Gendarmes knew that it would be best for them if he never got up . Aria hugged Ivan to her , hiding his eyes so he would not see . Bishop Peter weighed in with his silver crosier , forcing back the Gendarmes . Too late . Prince Akavarr lay slashed and still at the base of the Red Stairs . Chants of " treason " subsided , replaced by shocked silence as brittle as Barbary glass . Saint Zelda 's Day would be long remembered . Aria turned and took Ivan back up past the ladies and Kazaks on the balcony , past the dwarves straddling the gargoyles , headed for the Haram - trying to put distance between herself and what had happened . Prince Akavarr came looking for death and found it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boyars looked about for someone to blame , they were bound to remember her . D'Hay stood waiting where she had told him to stay , shifting from foot to foot . Pleased at his impatient obedience , she released him , saying , " Take charge of the Gendarmes - you are their new captain . See there is no more killing . " He bowed happily , bounding off to do her will . The boy showed promise , and she badly needed loyal young blades , having hardly anyone to trust - and enemies aplenty . Akavarr was only the most eager and bloodthirsty , but the most brainless drunken boyar could make the connection between the boy in her arms and the womb in her belly . Whoever laid hands on Ivan could rule Markovy in the boy 's name , undisputed so long as Aria was childless . Or better yet , dead . But if she married , or had a boy out of wedlock , the boyars would have to decide between the rights of a son by a second marriage , and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen how they settled things . Tears welled up . The only sure way to save herself was to be as bloodthirsty as they were . To do as her uncle suggested , kill the child in her arms , making herself the sole heir , thoroughly hated , but absolutely indispensable . Whoever she gave herself to would then be King . Sister Karinana met them at the Silken Door , a young nun not much older than Aria , wearing the white gown of a novice , without a hood or veil . Blonde stubble was just growing back on her bare head . Aria herself had recalled Karinana from a far-off White Sea convent , convincing the patriarch to release the young nun from her vows . Setting Ivan down , she told the child-king , " Go to your mother . " Ivan clung to her , the way he always did when afraid . He had known Aria all his life - his mother he had met only last month . It was hard for him to know what to make of this short-haired sad-eyed woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ease with the Haram dwarves . Patiently , the woebegone young nun took her reluctant son into her arms , thanking Aria for bringing him . Aria knew that gratitude did not run deep . Sister Karinana could also see the threat that Aria presented to her son . Karinana had been a young noblewoman , groomed to wed the king , imagining she would be a queen . To meet the needs of Aria 's family she had been put through the ordeal of a loveless marriage , separated from her son at birth , forced to take a nun 's vows , then released from years in a cell to find her child fearful and indifferent . Aria 's father had done that , out of love for Aria 's mother . And Aria still loved her dead father , loved him passionately . He had been the king , the center of her world , the source of all love and favor , the only parent she was allowed to keep . Which was why she had learned to laugh at the notion of justice , literally laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seeing a little female demon-child laughing at the law . Growing up untamed . KILLER OF CHILDREN Harams often had to be built inside out and upside down with internal balconies and rooftop gardens , to best use limited sunlight while showing a blank face to the world . Aria 's private bath was on the topmost floor , just below the hanging garden , light and airy , with thin columns supporting intricately carved alabaster screens that let in sunlight . Heavy wooden shutters closed off the heated room in winter - but in late October there were still days when bared screens caught the last of the light . Wrapped in a silk bathrobe , her toes trailing in warm rose water , Aria lay on cushions embroidered with spring flowers , listening to a castrated choirboy sing in sweet contralto to amuse her . He succeeded admirably , having high Kazak cheekbones , dark dreamy eyes , and black hair as untamed as a horse 's mane falling down his smooth strong back . His song thrilled Aria immensely , and his white robe trimmed in cloth-of-gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck shiver as he sang made her want to run hands over the boy 's throbbing throat , feeling jochi 's singing with her fingers . Girls came giggling in on bare feet , carrying bowls of honeyed yogurt - Tasha , Marta , Annya Tolstoy , and Sonya d'Medved - all wearing light robes in the steamy scented air . Clapping at the singing , they called to the boy , " Jochi , Jochi , play your balalaika for us . Play and we will feed you . " Sonya d'Medved , a boyar 's daughter and Haram favorite , tall and blonde , waved her bowl of sweet yogurt . " You can lick it from our fingers . " " Or off our breasts if you like , " Tasha teased him , dripping yogurt down her open front , then wiping it up with her fingers , sticking them one by one in her mouth . Tasha was a Tartar savage and Aria 's slave , but ranked high in the Haram 's unofficial hierarchy by being intolerably beautiful and insufferably sure of herself . Jochi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits , the choirboy ate sparingly , knowing eunuchs ran to fat - it would take more than a bevy of teenage girls to tempt him , no matter how they served the sweet yogurt . Seeing the boy would not give in , the girls set down their yogurt and swarmed over him , laughing and giggling , rubbing against the singing boy , kissing his cheek , then sliding slim hands inside the gold trim on his robe . His voice faltered , clearly distracted . Aria clapped for them to stop . " Sinful girls , why have you come to disturb this divine singing ? " " Your Highness . " Sonya d'Medved made a teasing little curtsy . " We came to bathe . " " And sow trouble , " Aria added , having been a teenager herself . Being locked away completely from men , cooped up among widows , wives , nuns , children , dwarves , and eunuchs could drive a young girl utterly crazy . Much of Aria 's reputation for wildness came from repeated attempts at escape . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is dreadful . " " You do not know how we suffer , " Sonya complained , " with the noise , the steam , the closeness , the crowding ..... " " With everyone talking at once , " Annya added . " And all whispering about us . " Sonya imagined herself the subject of limitless conversation . " And wanting to wash you , " Tasha complained . " Or scourge you with willow switches . " Marta shivered . " All because we wish to be clean ! " Annya Tolstoy , the bloodyminded baron 's statuesque niece , sounded like the most put-upon soul in Markovy - a martyr to cleanliness , licking honey yogurt off slim fingers . Aria shook her head , knowing well what the Haram baths were like , having used them often when Karinana was queen . Cleaner and better than any public bath in Markovy , they were tiled with marble and trimmed in gold , but still wet , steamy , sulphurously hot , and usually crowded with noisy naked women of all ages , washing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Haram , where gossip circulated and girls " figures were judged . If you were cute and unwary , you could get groped in the sauna . Or be beaten with a willow switch . So why put up with that ? These were the prettiest , and two of the noblest " virgins " in the Haram . " That makes it hardly worth bathing at all ? " " No , no , m'lady ! " They shook their pretty heads in defense of cleanliness . " Not here ! Not with you ! This is paradise . " Again that familiar m'lady - her handmaids were as bad as d'Hay . Beautiful blonde Sonya d'Medved made another bobbing curtsy . " Please let us stay and bathe here , under m'lady 's watchful eye . " Tasha ran her hand through Jochi 's hair , nodding at a three-stringed instrument lying behind him . " And have the boy play the balalaika . " Everyone looked to Aria . Bathing was a harmless indulgence , even thought to be healthful , and a eunuch 's voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's knife - but musical instruments were tools of the Evil One . And the cute young eunuch they were tormenting was a choirboy dedicated to Heaven . Sonya d'Medved smiled wickedly . " M'lady may do whatever she wants . " Here in the Haram it was almost true . Aria nodded , giving royal consent . With triumphant squeals the girls slipped off their robes , smothered Jochi with parting kisses , then slid laughing into her bathing pool . Youth and beauty won again over decorum and duty . Splashing playfully , they started washing each other 's hair , standing up to let warm rosewater slide like liquid silk off their smooth nude young bodies . Lying back on embroidered cushions , Aria watched the boy 's reaction under her lashes . Anyone who thought a eunuch could not have an erection had never been in a haram . Embarrassed , Jochi put the rounded body of his Kazak balalaika in his lap to hide his condition . Jochi had the " kindest " cut , used for clergy and lady 's companions , when only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eunuch favored in Kara Kathay . Jochi could copulate but not impregnate - a godsend to lonely Haram inmates . She had deceived Bishop Peter in confession , saying she had lusted for a man in her heart ; he naturally assumed she meant a " real " man - not a beautiful eunuch with broad shoulders , Kazak eyes , and the voice of an angel . Seeing Jochi 's long strong fingers on the balalaika frets made her want to kiss the tips . Aria had scant chance for a " normal " sex life . She had only met men when her father took her from the Haram , when Karinana was queen , and after her mother died . Her first lover had been her riding master , a small tough bandy-legged Kazak who spoke in grunts , but was wise in the ways of women and horses . And brave as well , since the penalties for molesting pretty young princesses were grotesque . Adept at everything he did , he employed the same sure gentleness with her that he used on young mares , seducing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lap , bringing her to orgasm without even breaking gallop . Having climaxed the first time she kissed a man left Aria with unreal expectations about love . Her Kazak never forced her , nor demanded intercourse , taking only what she offered freely and happily , treating her like a wild young mare who needed gentling before she could be ridden , doling out love like lumps of sugar . " Treat her well when she is young , and a mare will love you all her life , " he told her . " When she is grown , she 's yours to ride , and her foals and stallion will follow . " She came to understand that Kazak men thought sex was something close comrades shared , like milk from the same mare - he would have done the same if she had been a boy . How could he teach her to ride and to trust him unless they were free with their bodies ? And Aria was an avid learner , intoxicated by this wide open world of men and horses with its limitless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wanderer " and one day he was gone , leaving without notice and breaking her heart . Since then she had fared less well , first with a handsome falconer , then with one of her huntsmen , and finally with the false-hearted guard captain who had betrayed her to Prince Akavarr - showing how far Aria had fallen . All of them treated her like a prize landing unexpectedly in their laps , to be unwrapped and put to immediate use . Leading to endless wrangling over what should be acts of love . Which left women and eunuchs . Watching Sonya d'Medved holding up her long blonde hair while Marta washed it , Aria estimated the blonde girl 's maidenhead was a vague.memory at best , having gone to that same treacherous guard captain . Aria had been furious that a thoughtless slut like Sonya was free to do what a princess could not - at worst Sonya faced an abortion , or merciless beatings followed by forced marriage , but no one would kill her for giving birth . " What does m'lady wish to hear ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer looking embarrassed . " Something romantic , " she confessed , not minding the familiar m'lady from him . " To take my mind off troubles . " Smiling , Jochi sang a Kazak love song , light and stirring , like a horse 's canter . Hearing it tugged at her heart , reminding her of riding free over open steppe - which she had not done since Father died - making her miss her strange wild girlhood among men , riding and hunting , and sleeping on the steppe , cooking the day 's catch on a night fire while men told ribald tales around her , drinking themselves into a stupor ; then slipping off in tipsy secrecy to kneel in the long grass , and loosen a fellow rider 's trousers . Afterward she would lie in strong arms , learning Kazak names for the stars . Life with Father had given Aria a taste for male freedom that the Haram never provided . Jochi stopped , seeing the sadness in her eyes , asking , " What troubles m'lady ? " " Everything . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . Her parents were both dead . Her first and only love had deserted her . Her latest fling had betrayed her to Prince Akavarr , and her boyars meant to murder her , or force her into marriage - whichever best suited their needs . She had no one to defend her , aside from d'Hay and his doubtful Gendarmes . And perhaps the Kazaks . Or maybe her dwarves and eunuchs . " Even me ? " Jochi asked , clearly wanting to be no trouble . Such obvious concern was touching . Of all the men she had known , only her father really cared for her - even her Kazak riding master abandoned her when he was done . But this ardent choirboy meant to be true to her , she could see it in his eyes . Aria laughed . " You most of all . " His angel 's voice , beardless good looks , and man 's body made an intoxicating combination - incredibly tempting when you were alone and unloved . And he could not get her pregnant . " Why ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offended . " Because you give me hope . " And love . Much as she needed love , now was hardly the time for it . Boyers would not just kill her , but anyone close to her as well . Noblemen could be incredibly vindictive ; when Baron Tolstoy caught his wife with a groom , he had the groom castrated and hung outside his wife 's window , alongside the stable boy who stood lookout . All winter Baroness Tolstoy  --  Prince Akavarr 's sister  --  watched her lover twist in the icy wind beside the boy who helped bring them together . Aria did not want to find love , just in time to see him tortured to death by bullies in armor . " But m'lady , I mean to give you hope , " the young eunuch declared earnestly , " and to lighten your troubles . " She meant to give him his chance , for her troubles sorely needed lightening . And Jochi knew the risks of intimacy as well as she , better even , since he had seen how eunuchs were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " princesses , or young harlots-in-waiting like Sonya d'Medved , knowing the woman had more to lose than he did . For a Kazak riding master or a eunuch choirboy to do the same was a combination sacrilege and lose majeste . Aria could hardly make love within the Haram without condemning her partner to a ghastly death making her feel like a black widow . No wonder people thought her wicked . Seeing the girls were done with their hair , she gave them leave to go . Sonya d'Medved smirked knowingly as the teenagers toweled and dressed , watching her guard captain lover being replaced by a choirboy . The boyar 's daughter had a little yellow bird tattooed on her bare hip , the d'Medved golden martlet . Tasha came over to whisper to Jochi in Tartar , before going giggling off with the others . Girls " voices faded , replaced by warm rosewater splashing into mosaic basins , leaving Aria alone with her young eunuch . " Does m'lady wish another song ? " Jochi asked blandly , his balalaika still resting lightly in his lap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - especially about making love . She shook her head . " Not now . " Shy and unsure , she reached out to draw him closer . And he came to her , tender and eager at the same time , setting down the balalaika , and taking her in his big firm hands . His smooth strong body smelled of musk ; his kiss felt incredibly sweet . When their lips parted , she clung to him in happy relief . How long was it since she had been held like this ? So long she could not remember . Here was what passed for Haram freedom , freedom in hiding , her private world where she could have things as she pleased , where she and her women could be warm in winter , free to sip strong coca and speak their minds , free to hear music played , and to have hot saunas and cool sherbet , or make illicit love behind locked doors . A nagging voice told her to make the best of it , for it might not last . Reveling in forbidden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Jochi grinned . " M'lady , of course ...... She stopped his lips with her finger , " Please , do not call me , m'lady . " " Your Highness , I am sorry if .. " " Aria , " she told him . " You need not be sorry , just call me Aria . " That was what the men who loved her called her . Her Kazak never called her anything but " Aria . " Or when she had been especially good , " Pretty Filly . " " Aria , we all ... " " Say it again , " she insisted , thrilling to the sound - to be surrounded by people and hardly ever hear your name could be incredibly lonely . " Aria . Oh Aria . " jochi laughed , holding her closer , kissing her harder . His hand pushed up her robe to bare her hip , sending cool shivers down her back . " We all love you . My heart is yours to command . " She sighed , relaxing into his grip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I barely want to command at all - but no one gives me that luxury . Please , let love at least come free . " " Aria , I love you freely . " Jochi turned suddenly serious , looking levelly at his mistress . " Everyone does . " " Everyone ? " She thought of her boyars , and plain upright Markovites who hated her foreign blood , and superstitious serfs who heard hedge priests " lurid sermons about her Haram orgies - but all these opinions might not count to a Kazak eunuch who played the balalaika and prayed to heathen gods . " Everyone who matters , " Jochi declared earnestly . " Prince Ivan , all the eunuchs , those pretty girls who just left , the best of the dwarves , Bishop Peter , and what older women still have their wits . Some of them live in your grandfather 's time . " And a fine time it had been - if you could not use your imagination , what was the use of being locked away ? " I wish it were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and protected me . " " Aria , I would protect you . " Jochi looked beautifully concerned , like ardent young d'Hay - both eager to save her , yet clearly lacking the means . " Her " boyars had the men and arms to march into the Haram and take her , as soon as they summoned up the nerve . All Jochi and d'Hay could do for her was die . Tenderly he took her hands in his , kissing them lightly . " First m'lady must trust and believe in me . " " Trust you ? " An outrageous concept - after trusting only herself for so long , her psyche hardly worked that way . " How ? " He pushed her hands up above her head , holding them tight in his , resting easily on his elbows . She however could hardly move , and when she tried to protest , Jochi kissed her hard on the mouth to stop her . When he released her lips , he whispered , " By giving in to Death . " Aira lay staring up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hands held above her head . Excited , mystified , and somewhat scared - she had meant to have this boy , and now he was most certainly having her . By the way he pressed hard against her thigh , she could tell this young barbarian eunuch thoroughly enjoyed manhandling a princess . She asked as calmly as she could , " What do you mean ? " " Your only chance is to give yourself over to Death , utterly and completely . Fear alone holds us back . Accept your death , and the boyars will have no power over you . " Except to kill . Knowing she could not break his grip , she took a deep breath and asked politely , " Jochi , please will you let me go ? " " No . I do love you m'lady , but ..... " " Aria , " she reminded the big boy holding her down . " Aria . " He smiled devilishly . " I love you Aria . But I can not let your go until you have heard what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looking up at him . " Talk . " " You do not know who to trust . " He said it seriously and succinctly , as if this were somehow news to her ; the last man she let hold her betrayed her to Prince Akavarr . " So first you must know you can trust me with your life . After all , I could be an assassin paid by boyars to kill you ; any slave or eunuch could . " She nodded solemnly - that was how her mother died . Shifting his weight , he used one hand to pin both her wrists , then picked up a feather pillow , a green one embroidered with dandelions , practically her favorite . Holding it next to her upturned face - so close she could see the stitching on the tiny golden petals - Jochi sounded dead serious , reminding her the boy was born a horse barbarian , and had been badly treated since . " I could smother you with this pillow , and no one would hear , no one would save you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left alone . " Again she nodded , remembering her mother 's murder and her childhood terror of armed men . Letting go , she lay limp , listening to water splash on stone , feeling the weight of Jochi 's body and the strength in his arms . Tears welled up . When her mother was murdered , her father had taken her in his arms and held her tight , promising to love and protect her always . Now her father too was dead , but she was again in the arms of someone who would not hurt her , nor betray her , nor even get her with child - who would risk horrible death to see her alive and happy . She started to sob with relief . Releasing her wrists , the boy tucked the pillow under her , holding her close while she cried , stroking her long black hair . Jochi whispered , " Sweet m'lady Aria , you need never fear death and you need never fear death andyou need never be alone - those two great weights may be lifted from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wiping her eyes , she stared up at him , happy but bewildered . How strange to be in this heathen boy 's arms , listening patiently to his wild opinions - no longer a Princess , nor even a lady , just Aria - not required to know all the answers , nor make all the decisions . " To Death ? " " Yes . " Jochi nodded solemnly . " In person , to the demi-goddess herself - that alone will set you free . " She stared into his beautiful barbarian face , strangely excited that she and this bizarre boy held not just each other 's bodies , but each other 's lives in their hands . Was he mad ? Probably , though that no longer scared her the madder the better if it made her this happy . Kazaks were horse barbarians , worshipping raw forces of nature , fire , water , the four winds . Love and Death were demi-gods , natural forces in human form . To them , Death was a beautiful woman who lived far away at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ icy White Sea-or so her Kazak had said . Jochi must take it all more seriously . " In person ? " Aria asked . " How is that possible ? " " It can be done . " Jochi reached under her robe , starting to play with his pretty princess . " Though not by me , " he added . " It is a woman 's secret . " From the way he touched her , he clearly knew far more about women 's private mysteries than a " sexless " choirboy should . " Promise me that when the woman comes for you , m'lady will go with her . " Having delivered his message , Jochi was anxious to get her agreement , eager for what came next . " Aria , " she reminded him - no man was going to have her who did not know her proper name . " And , yes , I will go with her , " she promised . Only then did she give in to his stiff excitement . Two days later , after midnight on All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aria lay naked and asleep in her silk-curtained bed , with Marta and a dwarf on watch in the room beyond . Soft hands shook her awake . Expecting the summons would be from Tasha , or one of the Kazaks , she was astonished to see Sonya d'Medved sitting on her bed , wearing a plain black shift belted at the waist beneath a fur-lined cloak . Her long blonde hair shone in the lamplight , and Sonya had a knife thrust nonchalantly through her belt , though bringing edged weapons into Aria 's privy chambers was forbidden - in fact a flogging offense . But the boyar girl was a hopeless savage whose mother had died in childbirth and whose father was eaten by a were-leopard from out of the Iron Wood . " Forgive me , m'lady , " Sonya whispered . " It is time . " Again the familiar m'lady . Aria almost asked , " Time for what ? " but stopped herself , not wanting the arrogant boyar 's daughter ever to see her at a loss . It was bad enough having Sonya @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she got out of bed , silently wrapping herself in a cloak . Sonya picked up the lamp and went to the back wall of the room , pushing sideways on a piece of paneling that opened like a puzzle box , revealing hidden stairs . The Haram was honeycombed with secret passages , and Aria had known of this one since she was three , but she was sorry to see Sonya knew about it too , since the panel made a perfect bedroom listening post . Whispering , " Please follow me , m'lady , " Sonya led her down the winding stairs , closing the panel behind them . At the base of the stairs was a passageway leading into the Haram vaults ; here Sonya turned and went down on her knees , head bowed , asking , " Does m'lady hate me ? " " No , " Aria replied curtly , standing on the last step , trying to keep her antipathy toward Sonya completely out of this . Setting down the lamp , Sonya drew the knife from her belt , handing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I have offended you in the least , take my life now . " " Nonsense ! " Aria tried to hand knife back , exasperated by the impertinent girl 's theatrics . Sonya would not take it . Clasping her hands tightly behind her back , the boyar 's daughter looked straight up at Aria , baring her swan-white neck . " Your Highness , we are both orphans beset by enemies , and there must be total trust between us . After tonight , my life is in m'lady 's hands . If m'lady means to kill me for giving in to her guard captain , then I beg her to do it now . I would rather die here by your hand than have men drag me to the stake and bum me for witchcraft . " Feeling silly holding the knife , she told the blonde girl at her feet , " Get up . I will not kill you . " Sonya refused . " if m'lady will not forgive me , I would rather she did kill me . " Damning the girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who you sleep with . " " M'lady does care . " Tears appeared in Sonya 's eyes . " Or she would not be so cold to me . " Aria stared down at the girl , as if she were seeing Sonya d'Medved for the first time . " You are a most remarkable child . " " So I hope . " Sonya smiled , wiping off tears on her shoulder , while still holding her hands behind her . " When I was a motherless little girl , I gave myself to Death , knowing I would never live my life as I willed unless I was willing to die for it . Nothing I have seen since has made me think differently . If I try to please others , the best I could hope for is to live under the whip of a husband picked by my brothers - so I learned to please myself . " That explained the guard captain . Markovite marriage customs called for the bride to kneel and kiss her husband 's horse whip , to show he could use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ d'Medved had airs above her station ; now it seemed the teenage noblewoman aspired to be free . " Is that so bad ? " the girl asked . " Will m'lady not forgive me ? " Lowering the knife , she reached out her left hand , the witch 's hand , saying , " Aria . " Sonya looked dumbly up at her , the first time Aria had seen the blonde girl speechless . " M'lady is improper , " she explained . " You must call me Aria . " Taking her outstretched hand , the young d'Medved pressed it to her tearstained cheek , murmuring , " Does m'lady Aria forgive me ? " " There is nothing to forgive . " Aria was glad to be rid of that treasonous captain - in fact Sonya could have every Gendarme in the Guard so far as she cared . " I just did not know you loved me . " That was the true surprise , amazing considering how much she had despised the girl . " We all love you . " Sonya stared up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are the hope of the Haram . Of those who still have hope - for without you we are surely lost . " With that Sonya rose up , kissed her surprised mistress , then took back the knife and picked up the lamp , leading her down the passageway into the Haram vaults , an ancient warren of secret passages , hidden rooms , and dwarf tunnels . Cranky old Queen Ivanovna II was supposed to be bricked up somewhere down here . Sonya wound her way deep into the heart of the labyrinth , where huge Romanesque vaults supported the floors above . Ahead Aria saw light flickering between the columns . It was Tasha , wrapped in a cloak and holding a slotted lantern , waiting by a thick wooden door . Aria shivered , thinking of what lay behind the door . Sonya took her hand , whispering , " Highness , I know what you feel . Tasha is a barbarian - nothing bothers her - but we were bred for better . Promise me you will give in completely , no matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all . " Feeling the fierce sense of selfimportance in the teenager 's grip , Aria nodded silently . Far beyond worrying about Sonya 's presumption , she meant to be guided by the blonde girl 's unbending determination to live free or die . Tasha raised her lantern and pushed back the heavy door , sending rats scurrying . Aria had not been here since she was a child , with a child 's curious awe of death and dying , but the place had hardly changed a whit - bones were stacked high by the door , long bones on one side , skulls on the other , casting macabre shadows in the dancing light . Royalty lay along one wall , mummified in stone niches , but otherwise the bones were mixed together , women and eunuchs , slaves and favorites , some in neat stacks , others in heaps and piles - only the small children 's skulls stood out . From deep within the charnel house another light winked back at theirs - tiny and red in the shadows . It was the Bone Witch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Haram 's ossuary . Aria had heard there was a new Bone Witch , a young one , but she had never thought to see her - at least not on this side of the grave . Yet there was the witch sitting in her white winding sheet , wearing her knucklebone necklace and her charm bag stitched from human skin , holding a shining skull in her lap - a figure out of fairy tales come horribly to life . This witch did look young , with smooth ash-white skin , high Lapp cheekbones , and full wide lips , but her long tangled hair was already ivory white , held in place by carved bone clips . Her little fire burned at the end of a low heap of earth shaped like a dwarf 's burial mound . Looking up , the witch fixed Aria with big alert eyes , saying , " Welcome , Your Highness . Make yourself at home . " Forever . Here was where Aria hoped to end up - her mother and father lay together in a nearby niche . Curtsying low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might claim to be Princess Regent of Markovy , it was plain who ruled down here . Aria 's august uncle Grand Duke Sergey , her father 's deviously ambitious younger brother , was killed by the Bone Witch - along with his Ensign , Master-at-arms , and several lances of Gendarmes - after they foolishly barged into the Iron Wood , bothering her in her lair . Aria did not doubt for an instant the sorceress could do the same to her . Acknowledging her curtsy , the Bone Witch smiled archly , asking , " Why have you come here ahead of your time ? " So this was where she would lie . Aria surveyed the charnel vault with adult eyes , strangely relieved . Here her body would spend eternity ; but would it be in a noble niche , or heaped in a comer with the bones of slaves and stillborn babies ? More to the point , did it matter ? Not much from the look of it . She replied softly , " I came to make submission to Death . " Nodding like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witch asked , " Why now ? " " Because this is All Souls " Eve , " Aria answered , knowing this was the night when the gates between the worlds opened . " My life hangs in the balance , and somehow I must cast out fear . " " You have found the right place . " Smiling wider , the white-haired young witch reached out a slim hand . " Come meet your death . There is no sacrifice like a royal sacrifice . " Children knew the Bone Witch could kill with a touch , but Aria unhesitatingly took the witch 's hand , determined to give in totally , finding the white fingers firm and cool . Rising up , the Bone Witch placed the skull from her lap at the end of the altar mound , empty eye sockets facing the fire . Guiding Aria around to stand beside the earthen altar , the Bone Witch let go her hand , telling her to disrobe . " Naked you come , and naked you must go . " Again Aria obeyed at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shivering in the chilly bone vault , surrounded by generations of Haram dead . Then they laid her down on her back , stretched out along the earthen altar , her head resting on the bare skull by the fire . Sonya and Tasha knelt at her-feet , holding down her legs . Kneeling next to her head , with the fire between them , the Bone Witch took Aria 's wrists in her hands , beginning a low keening chant . Sonya and Tasha took up the chant , hands clasped tight around Aria 's ankles . Firmly fixed to the earth , Aria stared at the dark vault above , feeling the heat of the fire through her scalp . Lulled by the chanting , her mind started to drift . Leaning forward , the Bone Witch blew fumes from the fire into Aria 's face . Breathing deep , Aria drew in the fumes , closing her eyes and shutting out the charnel house , letting her mind drift farther , feeling herself sink deeper into the cold and dark . Slowly the chant faded into blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the ossuary , free of the Haram , borne away by the North Wind . Northern peoples had a cold hell , since fire held no particular horror for them - they had already seen hell , knowing full well it was winter without end . Death lived in a castle at the edge of the Arctic Sea , where winters were freezing black . In her mind 's eye , Aria saw the castle locked in winter , with the air so icy it took your breath away ; snow lay on towers and walls , and on the twin headlands . Ice spread out from the narrows , covering the Sound and stretching along the shores of the White Sea , breaking into drift ice in the dark distance . Whatever spell the Bone Witch put on her carried her straight into the snow-capped castle , passing through shuttered windows caulked with moss and hung with thick tapestries , landing her in the warm heart of the keep , where Lady Death sat enthroned before her fire . Standing stark naked - though not the least chilled - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throne , robed in black and wearing a great horned headdress that showed only the smiling face of a young woman . Despite her fearsome reputation Lady Death was small , and her throne room was full of life - animals had been brought in for the winter , not just dogs and pigs , but two huge rocs as well , three times as tall as a man and seated on high perches , preening their feathers , and cocking their great beaked heads to eye the castle pigs . Lady Death bade her welcome , " How happy to see you , my dear - if only in spirit . My name is Kore , but you know me as Death . " Lady Kore indicated a strikingly handsome young man with beautiful blond curls standing nearby , wearing a white-gold page 's costume with angel-wing sleeves . " This is Cousin Eros , for Love and Death are bound by blood . " Eros bowed politely . Kore nodded to a blonde teenager on her left , dressed in green like a maiden huntress , who might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and female - showing how closely the heathen gods interbred . " This is my sister Persephone , Killer of Children and Maidens . " Persephone smiled , showing her dimples . " And you are Aria , Princess Regent of Markovy , " added Lady Kore . " Why have you come here ahead of your time ? " Lady Kore sounded at a loss , but was only being polite . Death was ready whenever you were , and often long before . " As you see , we had no plans to receive you . " Feeling silly , standing naked before her betters - if only in spirit Aria answered as plainly as she could , " I came to make my submission to Death , to cast out my fear . " " Then be welcome . " Kore smiled warmly . " But only for a while , since your time is yet to come . " Lady Death indicated her little sister , saying , " Persephone will lead you to the dance . " Aria was ashamed to find herself impertinently mumbling " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiarity , Lady Kore returned the compliment , " Thank you , My Princess - for not fearing me . " Her blonde huntress sister , Persephone the Killer of Children and Maidens , strolled over , smiling slyly at Aria 's nude form , " Divine costume , my girl . They will adore it at the Dance . " Crooking her finger , Persphone led Aria from the throne room , guiding her down a wide winding stairway toward the hall below . Music wafted up , light and compelling , making Aria 's bare limbs twitch , aching to dance . Her feet started taking the stone steps two at a time , with a little skip and flourish . Persephone smiled at the barefoot twostep , saying , " Remember , I am the Killer of Maidens . Call on me and I will come . " Aria nodded , putting herself entirely into Persephone 's hands , letting the Killer of Children lead her into the dance . Ahead in Death 's firelit hall dancers whirled about , casting long leaping shadows on the keep 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirlpool of people in winding sheets , flapping robes and tattered clothes , spiraling in and out , twining back upon themselves , women , children , priests and paupers , saintly nuns , mothers with babies , Tartars and Kazaks , a thief with the noose still hanging around his neck . Castle cats joined in the Danse Macabre , twirling to the tune of a lute and fiddles . Giving in to the music , Aria took her place in the Dance of Death between a little girl in her nightshirt and a plodding serf in straw boots . Twirling in and out , she saw faces of the dead spiral by , grinning ecstatically ; most were strangers , but some she recognized , famous saints and sinners , then her old nurse . Prince Akavarr spun past , grinning broadly , then came her parents , arms linked and looking happy , crowns set jauntily on their heads . Aria opened her mouth to call to them , and the spell was broken . Suddenly she felt chilled to the bone , finding herself back in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Witch 's tiny fire , staring up into frigid darkness . Shaking so hard her teeth rattled , Aria drew in her limbs , unable to feel fingers or toes . Sonya and Tasha threw cloaks on her spasming body , adding her chemise and their own shifts to the pile . Then they crawled in naked with her , wrapping their arms and legs around Aria , hugging her icy body to their breasts , sharing their body heat , using living warmth to bring her back from the dead . This was the age-old Markovite cure for hypothermia , enfolding the victim in living flesh preferably young and female , though men did it for each other when there were no women about . By the time she could sit upright , the Bone Witch was gone and her fire dying- leaving Aria alone with her handmaids in the cold heart of the Haram vaults , unable to stand , much less walk . Sonya had to hold up her shivering body while Tasha dressed her ; then they set out , with Aria hanging onto the blonde boyar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lantern , and was soon out of sight . Stumbling along behind , Sonya kept whispering encouragement to her mistress . " Come , m'lady , there is a warm bed waiting - we only have to get there . " jochi met them at the foot of the secret stairs , saying , " Tasha told me to come . She has gone to get Marta and Anna Tolstoy . " Taking her from Sonya , Jochi carried her up the dark steps to her bed , where he went to work on her legs , kneading and rubbing life back into them . Tasha returned with warm sheets and a sleepy Anna Tolstoy . Together they took over from Jochi , who got under the warm sheets with her . Slowly life returned to her chilled limbs , sending pains shooting into frozen toes and fingers . Her teeth stopped chattering , and Jochi 's big body warmed her spine , returning heat to her frozen core . Expectant young faces surrounded her , concerned for their Princess , but eagerly wanting to hear what she had seen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did m'lady see Death ? " She nodded weakly , and Anna Tolstoy spoke for her . " Obviously , you blonde oaf , can you not see her Highness is half dead still ? " Tolstoys shared the blood royal , but the d'Medveds were mere boyars , pushy upcountry barons feuding with the Kazaks at the edge of the Iron Wood . Sonya started to snap back , but Aria stopped her with her hand , her tingling fingers barely feeling the girl 's warm lips . She told them , " I did see Death , and I made my submission . " " Did she offer her protection ? " This time no one reprimanded Sonya , knowing their fates all hung on the answer . She shook her head slowly , seeing their faces fall . " But Death bade her younger sister Persephone escort me to the dance . " That perked up the girls , who asked what Persephone was like , none of them having ever met a demi-goddess , certainly not one as fearsome as the Killer of Children . She described @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curls - not mentioning how she ended up dancing with Prince Akavarr and her dead parents . " And I saw Love as well , " she added . " He is both young and beautiful - looking like Persephone 's male twin . " " More beautiful than me ? " Jochi sounded wounded , having nursed his princess back to life only to hear her babble about hobnobbing with handsome demi-deities . " Of course . " Anna Tolstoy rolled her eyes in disbelief . " Love is a god - you are just a eunuch . " Haughty teenagers were the Haram curse , and Aria did not reprimand Anna , merely waving her to silence , asking to be alone . " Except for Jochi , for I want to hear music . " Her handmaids rejected that , insisting she must have a woman with her . " Jochi is a man - mostly . He will be lost in his music . Your Highness needs a handmaid to see to her needs , so your majesty may be warm , fed , and rested , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teach Anna Tolstoy not to be so proud , and because the blonde girl looked devastated at the thought of being dismissed with the others . Already Aria sensed a dangerous attachment but these were dangerous times . Tasha promised to keep watch , and Aria told her to get a trustworthy dwarf to help her . Tasha and Jochi grinned to hear their mistress telling a Tartar to be wary . Horse nomads were masters of stealth , moving invisibly over open steppe , appearing without warning a thousand leagues from where they were last seen . Producing his balalaika , Jochi played her Kazak tunes that sounded like wind singing through the grass tops , or tinkling caravan bells . Lying beneath a big down comforter , Aria dozed off , waking now and again to the music . Sonya was in and out of bed , keeping her warm and making her strong black tea . Truth to tell , Sonya just wanted to be at the center of things . Aria guessed the girl gave herself to the guard captain mainly to get closer to her mistress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , and flirting with Jochi over her shoulder . Anna Tolstoy was right ; Sonya was a scheming , willful , selfish upstart , determined to live free and well by whatever means she could . All of which qualities Aria desperately needed . Sleeping through All Soul 's Day , she got up only to hear mass from Bishop Peter , giving her thanks and praying for the souls of the dead . Back in bed , she did not stir until Sonya brought in a light supper of yogurt , dried fruit , fresh loaves , and plump steppe larks in prune sauce . Her brush with Death left her in no mood for stewed songbirds ; picking at her fruit and yogurt instead , she offered the rest to Jochi , who announced himself famished , setting down his balalaika and tearing off some bread , dipping it in prune sauce . Sonya asked if he missed his savage homeland , and Jochi nodded . " There is nothing like seeing the great Sea of Grass bowing in the wind , showing seven shades of green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " How did you come here ? " asked Sonya , picking a lark apart with painted nails and pretty white teeth . " Tartars , " the boy told her , saying it the way people say " plague " like a natural calamity . " Their flying ships fell on our camp without warning , taking us in our sleep . Everyone taller than a Wagon wheel was killed , and after watching our parents die , we were marched west toward Barbary in a great caravan of children . We bigger boys had wooden yokes around our necks , and the little ones were roped together . " " So do you hate Tasha for being a Tartar ? " Sonya asked . Jochi looked at her like the question made no sense . " Do you hate your cat for killing songbirds ? " " Sometimes . " Sonya sucked meat off a lark 's long bones . Shrugging at civilized ways , Jochi went back to his story . " We crossed the Black Sands desert , and were sold to Barbary traders by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were castrated . Since the Barbary traders would not take us uncut and Tartars have a taboo against it , they found a Christian to do it . " Neither Aria nor Sonya wanted to hear the horrible details , or how the wound was cauterized by burying him in hot sand . " Yet it does not stop you from making love , " Sonya observed . oil thought it would . " Jochi looked downcast , worse than when he told of his parents " murder . " I thought I would never touch a woman or have a woman touch me . Ever . " " But you found out you did not need them ? " Sonya suggested , who saw small need for testes herself , knowing full well where they could be found . Jochi laughed . " I found out I did not need women . Cute young choirboys need never be lonely . " Being Kazak , he found it natural to make love with his music master - swearing it made him more attentive and loosened up his voice . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - technically both were priests , with their manhoods dedicated to Heaven . " Only if unconfessed , " Jochi reminded her . " So you confessed ? " Aria asked , wondering what penance was proscribed for getting love lessons from your music teacher . " Yes indeed , " Jochi declared , " and I was soon sharing a cot with my Father Confessor . " Castration was supposed to prevent this - but in fact further confessions just led Jochi to lovers farther up the ecclesiastic hierarchy . " How high ? " Sonya demanded , pleased to hear that her betters were hopelessly steeped in sin . " As high as you can , " replied Jochi coyly . " Old Bishop Peter ? " Aria was aghast . Sharing a bedmate with Sonya had been bad enough - she never expected to be doing it with the Patriarch of Markov . " Old but upright , " Jochi assured them , " and he has been most kind to me - giving me little gifts and seeing to my advancement . How else could a poor Kazak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed ? Aria had thought it just a stroke of luck when Jochi became her choirboy . Hearing a shriek from down the hall , Aria looked up to see a female dwarf come running in wearing a feathered gown . It was Pipit , one of her seamstresses , a smart nimble-fingered girl from a peasant family . Doing a swift bobbing curtsy , Pipit announced , " Men , m'lady . Boyars . My Lord Tolstoy too . " Aghast , Aria sat bolt up in bed , pulling her robe tight around her , realizing that boyars had at last dared pass the Silken Door . Men were in the Haram ! Not just any men , the men who most wanted to do her ill . Heaven help them all . Hearing bootsteps in the hall and the rattle of armor , she had no time to summon the Guard - if she still had one - her only escape was into the Haram vaults . Sonya saw it too , leaping naked out of bed to open the secret panel at the back of the bedroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tripping over the dwarf , her face white as the Bone Witch 's hair . " My uncle , " the girl gasped . " He- .... " Before she could say it , Baron Tolstoy himself appeared in full armor at the head of his retainers , an iron mace in his hand , the type called a " holy water sprinkler " - much favored by fighting bishops because it killed without shedding blood . His men were less fastidious , having drawn swords , and with huge grins on their faces ; at last they were getting what men had wanted for centuries , to see the perfumed interior of the King 's Haram - without giving up prized body parts for the privilege . Her former guard captain was with them , still wearing his silver Gendarme 's armor , clutching Tasha 's bare arm in his mailed fist , half-dragging the helpless Tartar into the room . Aria ordered them out at once , standing upright on her bed , pointing at the door and wishing she had on her crown . " Go immediately , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just trying to give Sonya time to escape down the secret stairs , hoping the girl would think to take Jochi with her . Not everyone had to die with her . " This is the Haram , " she reminded them , " forbidden to men - your being here is ungodly and indecent . " That got a nasty laugh from her armored boyars , big bearded men , obscenely happy to be seeing a princess in her boudoir , with a naked handmaid and a eunuch with a balalaika . Anna Tolstoy stood frozen in horror . Tasha and Jochi stared at each other in expressionless silence being heathen nomads they knew they had fewer rights than dogs . Pipit the dwarf had already disappeared . Baron Tolstoy told the faithless guard captain , " Take her , but gently . " Handing the unresisting Tasha off to a retainer , the handsome black  --  bearded captain stepped up onto Aria 's bed - for the first time - their abortive trysts having all taken place outside the Haram , on hunts , in the stables , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this arrogant , stalwart-looking guardsman to captain - much less ever letting him touch her . He reached his mailed hand up to her . Suddenly , Sonya d'Medved was standing between them , still stark naked , golden hair spilling down her back . " Stop , " Sonya shouted . " This is your Princess Regent , in his majesty 's Haram . " Aria 's heart sank . Idiot girl , she was supposed to get away . Sonya at least could have lived . Aria had counted on Sonya to think only of herself ; instead the boyar 's daughter was smack in the midst of things , putting her bare body between Aria and these killers . Bravely facing the big armored guardsman , with his hard dark eyes and haughty sneer , Sonya tried to shame the man they once shared , saying , " You can not touch her royal person . " Their former lover laughed , claiming , " It is far , far too late for that . " Then he backhanded Sonya across the mouth with his armored hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blonde girl 's fall , and began beating on Jochi with their sword hilts - though Tolstoy warned them sharply not to kill him . Stepping over the sobbing Sonya , her guard captain again held out his mailed hand , his steel knuckles flecked with the teenager 's blood , saying , " Her Highness had best come with me . " " Tell them to stop beating the boy , " she commanded , glaring back at him . " Then I will come . " He laughed again , " You have no choice . " She turned to Tolstoy , " Hurt him any more , and I will make you kill me right here . " Death had taught her she always had a choice . " Then you will have done all this just for a corpse . " Tolstoy raised his hand , halting the beating , and she let her traitorous guard captain drag her off the bed . Boyars closed in on her ; the blades she had seen since childhood finally bared . Ever since she was a little girl these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother 's ways , for mocking their power , and for filling the palace with music and song ; now they were finally free to do as they pleased with the godless witch . She could feel their jubilant relief . DEATH TAKES A FLiER Aria found herself back in her old nursery , not the room where she was born , but a windowless room that Karinana had put her in when she was twelve , with a high ornate blue-white ceiling and small decorative panels set at a child 's eye level . She had not liked it then , and liked it even less now . The gaily painted wooden door locked on the outside , making it seem like a cell - more now than ever . To a teenager it felt like a prison , to an adult it was one . Worst of all there were no secret entrances she knew of , and furnishings were equally meager , a pair of sleeping cushions , a fur coverlet , and a chamber pot , showing her stay was temporary . Sitting on one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Jochi and the others . Aria had already given herself up to death . All her life these men had longed to destroy her , now they had only to decide how . Knowing she was lost freed her of fear - still she hoped somehow to save those few who loved her . She had Tolstoy 's word he would not hurt Jochi , and so long as no one knew they were lovers the baron had no need to break his word about a choirboy . Her handmaids had no such guarantee . Sonya had already been hurt , and Tasha was Tartar and female , giving her no rights whatsoever , just the sort of good-looking girl any boyar could throw a rope around and take back to his household . Aria hoped Tasha 's new owner was kind . She was not terribly worried about Anna Tolstoy . Anna 's uncle appeared unannounced , unlocking her door and swaggering in with a cheery , " Good morrow , Your Highness . Have you slept well ? " " Oh , how wonderful . " She lifted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Someone to change the chamber pot . You will find it in the corner by the door . " Baron Tolstoy laughed . " As always , Your Highness has an excellent sense of humor . " Obviously . It came with being a princess , otherwise she would have gone utterly daft by now . " I merely hoped to get something out of your visit . " " Her Highness can indeed profit from my visit . " Tolstoy beamed happily . " If you are cooperative . " " Cooperative ? " Aria eyed him evenly . " How ? " His voice dropped , becoming conspiratorially familiar . " Begin by telling me where you hid Prince Ivan . " Ivan gone ? This was news to her , but it explained a lot . No wonder she was being treated so royally - giving a private audience to Baron Tolstoy , instead of two brawny eunuchs with a bow string . Without Ivan , she alone had her father 's blood and could produce an unquestioned heir . She dared not let Tolstoy know she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead , " Why should I tell you ? " " We are cousins , " Baron Tolstoy reminded her , " sharing the blood royal - among other things . " " Distant cousins . " Her blood was far more royal than his , but they were kin of a sort , both descended from Ivan the Idiot . Her paternal greatgreat-grandmother was half-sister to Tolstoy 's great-grandmother- and from what she heard they had hated each other as only half-sisters can . " Precisely , " Tolstoy declared warmly , " and cousins so distant could easily become closer . " This amazing clod was flirting with her . So what if they were kissing cousins ? She still never imagined Baron Tolstoy as marriage material ; for one he was still married to the late Prince Akavarr 's sister , Aria 's aunt . She told him pointedly , " Prince Ivan 's safety means the most to me - he is true heir to the throne . " " Of course , " Tolstoy intoned piously . " And who better to watch over him than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . " " Yes indeed . " She smiled primly . " Too bad one of us is already married . " Though not happily ; having his wife 's lover hanging outside the window all winter hinted at a troubled marriage . Tolstoy answered airily , " Wives can be put aside , as you well know . " Just what you want to hear from a prospective bridegroom . Marriage was clearly a matter of convenience to Tolstoy , and at the moment he found it convenient to propose to her . She would be mad to accept , and a total dolt to turn him down directly . Aria flashed her sweetest smile . " When you are free , come see me . " " Or we can wring Prince Ivan 's location out of you with the rack and thumbscrews , " Baron Tolstoy suggested , " like many are loudly proposing . That might amuse both of us . " Marrying Tolstoy or death by hideous torture - hard call . How come she never got the easy picks ? Why did she have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down armed maniacs in her boudoir ? Someone else could do it far better . Young d'Hay had the brawn and bravery for armed mayhem , and Tolstoy seemed to think he could do a vastly better job of governing Markovy 's absurd collection of murderous boyars , eunuch priests , impudent handmaids , heathen witches , defenseless serfs and barbarous Kazaks . Looking coolly back at the baron , Aria told him , " Torture will not make me give up my little brother . " " Really , Your Highness ? " Tolstoy glared down his long nose at her . " Your loving boyars are still eager to try . " She shrugged , not knowing where Ivan was anyway . Having given herself up to Death made Aria far less fearful of torture . Death offered a haven to all who had nowhere else to go , and Persephone , Killer of Children and Maidens , had promised to come if she called . Seeing he was getting nowhere , Tolstoy departed , presumably to search for Prince Ivan . Leaving her alone to think . Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be dead , but she doubted it . Had Tolstoy secretly done away with Ivan , he would be pressing his suit much harder . Tolstoy acted like he still hoped to get hold of Ivan , and might not need Aria at all . But if Ivan was alive , where was he ? Could Karinana have him ? Not likely , even Tolstoy would have checked to see if the boy was with his mother . Besides , if Ivan were free , he would not go to Karinana - but to someone he knew better . But who ? She almost did not want to guess - what she did not know they could not wring out of her . And as long as Ivan was missing , Tolstoy would not likely kill her . Killing her would mean civil war , with a half-dozen claimants . Tolstoy wanted to be king , but he was merely a baron from a cadet branch of the family ; Aria had bastard cousins with far better claims than he had . Ambitious upcountry boyars like the d'Medveds would rise up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who stood to profit from chaos were the ones who would kill her outright , but the fact that she was breathing meant she was not in their hands - yet . How ghastly to think that all these men wanted was her womb ; that Tolstoy would murder her or make love to her , as needed . It made Aria want to gag . And it made her miss jochi , who cared for her , not what she could produce . Worried sick about the boy , she had dared not ask after him - the slightest sign of concern from her could easily get someone killed , or at best gruesomely tortured . As Aria pondered her problems , a wall panel popped out and a dwarf stuck his head into the room , saying , " Thought that huge nasty bigger would never leave . " Remembering his manners , the dwarf asked , " Your Highness , have I leave to enter ? " " You have . " She recognized Goliath , an especially tiny dwarf , barely two feet tall , but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dressed by the women in yellow silk doll clothes , and was small enough to use the tiniest dwarf tunnels - those no " bigger " even knew about . Stepping like a genie out of the wall , Goliath did a neat salaam , saying , " Please , Your Highness must come with me . " Sitting on her cushion , she still had to look down at Goliath . " If I must , I must , " she agreed , " but your tunnel is too tiny for me . " " Worry not , m'lady . You are small for a bigger . We will manage . " Goliath produced a high-pitched bone whistle , and blew on it . Dwarves were prized in Markovy - some would say worshipped . What others called a deformity , Markovites counted a blessing , and any peasant or artisan family having a grown child less than three-foot-six never had to pay taxes again . Dwarves born to serfs and slaves were automatically freed and made dependents of the crown , living at King 's expense among people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in hope of raising the dwarf population . Alas , most children of dwarves grew to normal heights - but they too got good marriages or crown jobs , encouraging their parents to try again . Free from protocol , coming and going as they willed , dwarves were the only " intact " males in the Haram . They were often grossly mistreated - drunken boyars had dwarf tossing contests , playing keep-away from the dogs , or just doused dwarves with brandy and set them alight - but dwarves were never punished for not being " normal . " They did not have to hold jobs , pay taxes , go to chapel , nor even bow to the King . Pipit was a seamstress because she liked to sew , and Goliath had good manners because he was Haram born - none of that was required . Growing up short was all that mattered . Ghastly deaths awaited anyone who maimed normal children to pass off as dwarves , for both mocking Heaven and cheating the King . An answering whistle sounded above , then a trap opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her side . Neat trick , having her exit drop out of nowhere . Goliath helped put her slippered foot in a loop at the end of the rope , then she held on while he whistled again . Slowly the rope withdrew into the ceiling , pulling her up with it . When she was two or so she used to use the dwarf tunnels all the time - but gradually she outgrew them , getting normal-sized playmates . When she had this room as a young teen she had not known there were tunnels in the wall and ceiling , and she was giving dwarves a peep show whenever she stripped for bed . The opening above was just big enough for her shoulders , and the trap closed behind her as she was lifted into a smooth wooden shaft going straight up , then curving gradually , until she was being hauled along horizontally , her silk dress sliding silently over lacquered wood . Negotiating several tight curves , she slid through tunnels too narrow for a grown man , and nearly too small for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lit by an oil lamp and crammed with dwarves , who had used counterweights and a windlass to pull her along . Here she had room to stand , but all the tunnels leading out were at least as small as the one through which she came in . Pipit was there , along with four males who worked the windlass ; Squinty , Gnat , Timothy , and Ezekiel . Aria thanked them enthusiastically ; to be out of Tolstoy 's hands was an amazing relief . She had been sure she would be either married or murdered - maybe both . " Thank you , thank you , " she gushed her gratitude . " You have done the crown an inestimable service . " Gnat stepped up , doffing his belted cap , and bowing deep . " We thank m'lady for being so light , and delicately built - few biggers could have slid so easily through our tunnels . " " Beware , m'lady , " Pipit warned , " he only wants to look up your dress . " She looked down at the dwarf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ? " " ' Fraid so , m'lady , " Gnat admitted ; being a dwarf , he did not fear punishment and answered honestly . Only dwarves and nobles knew how it felt to be free . " Ladies let him do it when he was young , " Pipit explained . " Now he is sore addicted to it . " " So ? " Gnat glared pointedly at Pipit . " There 's skirts around here I would not look up , not for a pot o " gold . " Pipit snorted , telling him , " Throw back the trap . " Gnat heaved open a trapdoor in the floor , and Pipit motioned to her . " M'lady , this is how you must leave . " Looking down , she saw light at the far end of a deep dark shaft ; stepping into another loop of rope , she let them lower her into the heart of the Haram vaults - not the charnel house this time , but into a walled  --  up stone chamber that could only be reached through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she saw the dwarves had turned it into a throne room . Ivan sat on an ornate dinner chair set up against one wall the only piece of furniture aside from the royal doll bed and chamber pot . He beamed in the lamplight , incredibly happy to see her . " Aria , Aria , this is passing wonderful . " Aside from Jochi , Ivan was the only male who consistently called her Aria . " Oh , I so sorely feared you were dead . " " Not quite yet . " She knelt before Ivan , feeling silly being the only person over three feet tall . All her life she had been underfoot ; suddenly she was a giant . " I did see Death , but just for a visit . What is this place ? " " My throne room , " Ivan announced proudly , his feet swinging freely inches above the floor . " Dwarves found it for me . They used to keep Old Queen Ivanovna in here - but that was long ago . " Cranky old Queen Ivanovna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charnel house with everyone else . Even the horror of being walled up alive merely led to death , then the ossuary . " I am in charge now , Aria , " Ivan told her solemnly , " so you must tell me what to do . " Aria reached out to him . " First give your Princess Regent a royal hug . " Ivan hopped off his dining-chair throne into her arms , sobbing with relief , while his dwarf court whistled and stomped . When she was done comforting her prince , she asked the dwarves what was happening in the Haram ; it turned out Tolstoy 's men were searching desperately for Ivan , from the drains to the attic , much to the dwarves " amusement . Biggers had scant hope of ever finding him , the room having been bricked up for almost two centuries , so long no one but the dwarves knew about it . " And they do not yet know that Your Highness is missing as well , " the dwarves added happily . They also said Jochi and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dwarves could not get at them . She asked if any of them knew Lord Valad d'Hay - several did , remembering how he barged handsomely into the Haram on the day Prince Akavarr died . " Find him , " she ordered in Ivan 's name . " Tell Lord d'Hay I am alive and in hiding ; ask him to see if the Kazaks will stay loyal . " Her Gendarmes had gone over to Tolstoy , leaving Jochi 's people her only potential allies outside the Haram - if the dwarves could get to d'Hay , and d'Hay could get to the Kazaks . Aria settled down , waiting for good news from d'Hay . From time to time she had herself hauled up to the windlass room , watching the progress of the search through peepholes . Seeing huge men in iron armor clanking about the silken rooms , tripping over cushions and slashing behind hangings with their swords gave her something of the dwarves " contempt for biggers . Not better , not smarter , not nicer - just bigger . Five days later Tolstoy struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow in the air . Dwarves brought word that a breaking wheel and a pair of burning stakes were set up in Temple Square , in front of the Friday Market . Determined to see for herself , Aria wormed her way through dwarf tunnels to a trap that opened above the King 's Gallery , the marble balcony where kings of Markovy were proclaimed . Lifting the trap , she looked down on Temple Square two stories below her . Snow dusted the great wooden Temple of Baldar the Good on the east side of the square , facing All Saints " Cathedral . Across from her on the north side of the square stood the Friday Market , a stone arcade of shops , inns , and public baths facing the Haram-Palace . Like the dwarves had said , the square was set for executions , with a breaking wheel , two burning stakes , and a great pile of brushwood . Ominous . Aria said a swift prayer to Death , whose day this clearly was . Her boyars had built a gruesome altar to Lady Death in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady , I have given myself up to you - if this is my day to die , so be it . Please send Persephone for me . But I beg you to spare those whose only crime is to love me . May you dwell forever in darkness . Amen . " Sensing a crisis coming , she sent for Ivan , and dwarves brought their little prince to where Aria waited atop the trapdoor . By then there were people assembling , spilling out of the Friday Market which was already open for business - nothing brought out Markovites like a multiple execution . Baker 's boys started hawking meat pies to the growing crowd . Then came the blare of trumpets , and she saw Tolstoy and his guards file out of the palace gate , leading a trio of prisoners - Jochi , Sonya , and Tasha . Anna Tolstoy was conspicuously absent . Aria watched in helpless anguish as Jochi was bound to the breaking wheel , wearing only a loincloth and his broken balalaika hanging around his neck . Tolstoy 's herald read off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unnatural relations with Princess Aria , and possessing a musical instrument . Tasha and Sonya were led to the burning stakes , both accused of witchcraft . Only accused , since Tolstoy made no pretense of holding trials . Boyar law allowed lords to juggle the order of justice , and sentences could be carried out before conviction , or appeal . But this was not a real legal triple execution - this was a message to the Haram , and to Aria most particularly . And it worked . Tolstoy had found a way to hurt her , even in hiding . Horrified , Aria saw her former guard captain turn her two handmaids over to Tolstoy 's executioner - a big muscled brute called Magog , famous for his skill and cruelty , who could flay a man to the spine with a single blow of the knout . Or lightly carve his single initial with a whip . As Magog bound her to the stake , Sonya d'Medved shouted a vulgar insult at the guard captain - the girl had a blue bruise on her chin from when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lifted an eyebrow . " Having fun , Sonya ? " " More than with you . " Sonya laughed at him as serfs piled wood at her feet . " I 've known eunuchs with more manhood . " " You have known your last eunuch , Sonya . " He nodded toward the nearby altar topped by flint and tinder . " In a few minutes I will kindle your fire with my own hands . " " Finally found a way to warm a woman ? " Sonya smirked . " Too bad it can not be in bed . " Sonya 's guard captain lover was at a serious disadvantage , being mocked by a pretty girl half his size , tied to a stake and about to die . He could not help but look silly . Hitting her had not helped , since the bruise on her chin only made Sonya more mouthy , daring him to do it again now that her hands were tied . Which got the crowd on Sonya 's side , cheering her retorts with cries of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sass em , Sonya , " mixed with the odd call to , " Bum the bitch ! " Jochi and Tasha were mere nomads ; people had poured into Temple Square to see how a d'Medved died , and Sonya did not mean to disappoint her public . Chanting rose up to drown out the catcalls as Bishop Peter emerged from All Souls " Cathedral in full regalia , followed by deacons , archpriests , acolytes , nuns , cantors , and singing choirboys dressed in white and trimmed with cloth-of-gold - a noisy glittering procession that parted the crowd , preceded by chanting curates swinging smoking censers . Backed by his white-robed flock , the Patriarch of Markovy marched straight up to Baron Tolstoy , who sat on horseback to be above the crowd . Supported by his silver crook , Bishop planted himself directly in the mounted nobleman 's path , saying , " Cease and desist . What you do here goes against Heaven . " " Really ? " Tolstoy sneered , " I thought sodomy , witchcraft , and stringed instruments went against Heaven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Old Bishop Peter shook his silver shepherd 's crook at the presumptuous boyar , shouting , " Blasphemous sinner , Mother Church must judge these crimes . You have no right to say what Heaven wills . Satan has hold of your soul , and you stand on the very edge of the pit ; step back now or vile death shall take you . " Tolstoy looked wholly taken aback , shocked by the Patriarch 's vehemence . The surprised boyar did not know the beautiful boy tied to the breaking wheel had been the old bishop 's bedmate - that the white graceful limbs Magog was about to smash had often been locked about the Patriarch of Markov . " Beware , old priest , " Tolstoy warned , " meddle not in men 's business . " Tolstoy would not stop for Bishop Peter , so Aria had to act . She could not crouch in darkness , watching Jochi broken apart while Tasha and Sonya were burned alive . Swinging her legs through the trapdoor , she let herself down into the shadows at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riveted on the stand-off between the boyar and the bishop . Now she would see if her submission to death was real . Whispering up to the dwarves , she had them hand Ivan down to her . He clung hard to her , asking , " What is happening , Aria ? " " Nothing bad , " she hoped , her heart beating like a hare 's . " We are just going to make an appearance - be a king . " Ivan nodded solemnly , his royal gaze fixed on her . Saying a short prayer to Lady Death and to her sister Persephone , Killer of Children and Maidens , Aria stepped up to the balcony rail , shouting , " Cease , in the name of Prince Ivan . " " Yes ! Cease , " squeaked Ivan , " in my name . " Cheers erupted from the crowd , ecstatic at seeing their missing prince suddenly appear alive and unharmed on the King 's Gallery . Aria saw Tolstoy retainers rush for the Red Stairs with misdirected enthusiasm dwarves had locked and bolted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anger , Tolstoy called for her to come down . " And bring Prince Ivan with you . " Aria ignored his demand , seeing a winged shadow sweep across the upturned faces of the crowd , a gray feathery shape she recognized at once . People cried out in frightened wonder , " Dear Heaven ! Look , it 's Death 's Shadow ! " Tolstoy alone seemed immune to the miracle , still calling to her , " Come down at once . " She watched the shadow sweep by a second time , gliding over the sea of upturned faces , like the gray cast that moves slowly over the visage of the dying . She called out to the crowd , " Cease now . Return to your homes . " But the mass of common Markovites stood rooted in the square , stunned by the miracle they were witnessing . Annoyed with everyone 's inaction , Tolstoy told his guard captain , " Kindle the fire . " Which the captain did , lighting a pine knot torch . " Will you come down now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tolstoy turned to the guard captain , saying , " Immolate one of the women . " Striding over to where Sonya waited , the guard captain held up the lit torch for the bound girl to see , letting her feel the heat . He grinned as the shadow swept past a third time , saying , " Here , honey , I will always remember you fondly ...... As he spoke , a silver shaft struck him from above , a shining arrow that seemed to sprout suddenly from the back of his neck . Crumpling forward silently , he dropped his torch , falling in an armored heap at Sonya 's bound feet . Looking down at him , the boyar 's daughter laughed , saying , " Sorry I can not say the same . " Wings beat the air , and a huge woman-carrying roc landed beside the burning stakes . Persephone sat on the bird 's back , her silver moon bow in hand - people shrank back , glad to give her room . Tolstoy stood staring in astonishment , unable to believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Death 's little sister looked levelly at Magog , who had picked up the captain 's fallen torch . " You trespass on my domain , I am Persephone , the Killer of Children and Maidens . " Looking about anxiously , Magog saw he was facing Death 's sister alone . He lowered the torch , protesting , " They are not maidens , m'lady . " " Why ? " Persephone asked . " Because you raped them ? " Markovites thought it unlucky to execute a virgin , and it was the executioner 's duty to see that did not happen . " Do not think a man may unmake a maid so easily . " Looking anguished , Tolstoy 's executioner asked , " M'lady , if I have somehow offended .... " Persephone raised a hand . " You have trespassed on my domain , and now you must enter it completely . Have you any preference how ? " Persephone nodded at the prone captain , saying , " That is paralysis ; he is not even dead yet . " Magog did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrows in her quiver . " Plague ? Too slow . Heart failure ? Too swift . Stroke ? Perfect , do n't you think ? Gives you time to remember your sins . " Settling on the stroke arrow , she shot the horrified executioner with it , saying , " Welcome to our kingdom . " Aria was struck by the arbitrariness of death , having thought Persephone was coming to take her . Startled gasps from the crowd were followed by wild shouts of approval and a ragged cheer . Tolstoy 's executioner had made enemies in his successful career of cheerfully killing and torturing in public - even condemned criminals had friends and family . Angered , Tolstoy ordered his shamefaced retainers to quiet the crowd , but they had only indifferent success . Boyars ruled through fear , lording over unarmed people , but Aria could see Tolstoy 's control slipping . His most feared servant had been shot down by a blonde demi-god on a big bird , who continued to defy him . Persephone told the angry boyar , " I am the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority - his life and death lie in my hands . " " How dare you ? " Tolstoy demanded . " A heathen demon with blood on her hands has no rights to our prince royal . " " Really ? " Persephone arched- a blonde eyebrow as she rummaged through her quiver . " What death do you desire ? " " Stop her , " Tolstoy shouted to his men - but not a single retainer moved to get between him and Persephone 's deadly arrows . Only Bishop Peter dared step forward , waving his silver crosier at the beleaguered baron , then pointing it at Persephone . " Death hangs over you , " the Patriarch declared . " You have threatened the crown , denied Heaven , and invited in Death . Heed this last warning before it is too late ..... " As if on cue , Aria saw armed men pour out of the great wooden temple to Baldar the Good . Kazaks with heavy armor-piercing bows eagerly took up firing positions from which they could sweep the square . Among them were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaped like a bird - the d'Medved golden martlet . At their head was a knight wearing Aria 's own silver and black - she recognized young Lord Valad d'Hay , her new guard commander . Caught between priests , populace , and armor-piercing arrows , boyars began to waver . Aria almost felt sorry for Tolstoy , seeing how he had unwittingly taken on the Church , Death , dwarves , and now the d'Medveds and Kazaks - when all he wanted to do was steal Ivan from the Haram , a seemingly simple task that had him hopelessly beaten and hanging by a thread . Lifting Ivan higher to show for whom she spoke , Aria told him , " Throw down your arms and submit . Only that will save you . " She had submitted to Death , and it certainly saved her - now it was Tolstoy 's turn . " Yes , " Ivan added shrilly , emboldened by his sister 's defiance . " Submit ! " Markovites packed into Temple Square took up their crown prince 's demand , turning it into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Voices rolled back through the crowd like a wave , growing in volume . All their lives disarmed Markovites had lived in fear of the boyars and their overarmed retainers . Seeing that Death 's sister and the horde of heathen Kazaks meant them no harm - that ordinary Markovites were immune while the boyars were not - lifted people 's lifelong fear , replacing it with anger at what they had endured . Surging forward , the crowd called out even louder , shouting , " Submit ! Submit ! Submit .... " One by one the boyars did , bowing and dropping their weapons onto the ground , then going down on their knees before the child on the King 's Gallery . Tolstoy too gave in , sinking to his knees in surrender , drawing an ironic cheer from the joyous crowd . Aria was jubilant , her feeling of doom lifted . Death had passed her by , even though she offered herself freely . But who was she to question a demi-god ? She told the dwarves above her to find Sister Karinana , knowing Ivan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Kazaks and d'Medveds , young d'Hay moved among the boyars below , taking away their weapons and tossing them into a heap beneath the King 's Gallery . Last of all he took Tolstoy 's sword , adding it to the growing pile of cutlery  --  making the Kazaks the largest armed force left , but they were dismounted and separated from the steppe , and not at all likely to run wild . What they wanted was more respect and suitable rewards - both of which they were going to get . Like her Kazak had said , treat a mare well when she 's young , " and when she is grown she 's yours , and her foals and stallion will follow . " Freeing Tolstoy 's prisoners , d'Hay brought them over to stand before the King 's Gallery , Jochi in just his loincloth , the girls in their burning smocks . Jochi gave her a lopsided grin , which Aria struggled not to return , knowing personal celebration would have to wait . She was a maiden princess who must be chaste in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased by his performance . " Please forgive me , Your Highness . In the absence of orders I was forced to improvise . Since Kazaks and d'Medveds are blood enemies , I had to show them their common interest , taking the liberty of promising lavish rewards from the crown . " " Well done , " Aria applauded his initiative . Whatever price deliverance had cost would be paid - out of Baron Tolstoy 's estates . " And nothing for yourself ? " " Only the honor of serving you , " d'Hay replied proudly , dropping to one knee . Her gaze met Sonya d'Medved 's , and the blonde girl smirked behind d'Hay 's back - seeing another bold assertive guard captain begging to serve his mistress . Hopefully he would do better than the last . Looking back down at d'Hay , Aria decided he was indeed handsome , kneeling in his shining armor before the gleaming pile of edged steel - a heap of weapons that would no longer be used against her . Not the total answer to her prayers , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying , " This is an honor you have well earned . " With a flutter of great wings , Death 's little sister flew off , rising into the cold bright sky on her huge roc , with her silver bow and poisoned quiver slung across her back . Pretty blonde Persephone , the Killer of Children and Maidens , had much to keep her busy , and could ill afford to linger where there was no more killing to be done . Markovites cheered in happy relief , hoping she would never return . Sidebar COMING ATTRACTIONS Sidebar THAT COVER PAINTING for M.
