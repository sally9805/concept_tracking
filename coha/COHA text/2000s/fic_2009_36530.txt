Sum <br> In the afterlife you relive all your experiences , but this time with the events reshuffled into a new order : all the moments that share a quality are grouped together . <br> You spend two months driving the street in front of your house , seven months having sex . You sleep for thirty years without opening your eyes . For five months straight you flip through magazines while sitting on a toilet . <br> You take all your pain at once , all twenty-seven intense hours of it . Bones break , cars crash , skin is cut , babies are born . Once you make it through , it 's agony-free for the rest of your afterlife . <br> But that does n't mean it 's always pleasant . You spend six days clipping your nails . Fifteen months looking for lost items . Eighteen months waiting in <br> line . Two years of boredom : staring out a bus window , sitting in an airport terminal . One year reading books . Your eyes hurt , and you itch , because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take your marathon two-hundred-day shower . Two weeks wondering what happens when you die . One minute realizing your body is falling . Seventy-seven hours of confusion . One hour realizing you 've forgotten someone 's name . Three weeks realizing you are wrong . Two days lying . Six weeks waiting for a green light . Seven hours vomiting . Fourteen minutes experiencing pure joy . Three months doing laundry . Fifteen hours writing your signature . Two days tying shoelaces . Sixty-seven days of heartbreak . Five weeks driving lost . Three days calculating restaurant tips . Fifty-one days deciding what to wear . Nine days pretending you know what is being talked about . Two weeks counting money . Eighteen days staring into the refrigerator . Thirty-four days longing . Six months watching commercials . Four weeks sitting in thought , wondering if there is something better you could be doing with your time . Three years swallowing food . Five days working buttons and zippers . Four minutes wondering what your life would be like if you reshuffled the order of events . In this part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earthly life , and the thought is blissful : a life where episodes are split into tiny swallowable pieces , where moments do not endure , where one experiences the joy of jumping from one event to the next like a child hopping from spot to spot on the burning sand . <br> Egalitaire <br> In the afterlife you discover that God understands the complexities of life . She had originally submitted to peer pressure when She structured Her universe like all the other gods had , with a binary categorization of people into good and evil . But it did n't take long for Her to realize that humans could be good in many ways and simultaneously corrupt and meanspirited in other ways . How was She to arbitrate who goes to Heaven and who to Hell ? Might not it be possible , She considered , that a man could be an embezzler and still give to charitable causes ? Might not a woman be an adulteress but bring pleasure and security to two men 's lives ? Might not a child unwittingly divulge secrets that splinter a family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad  --  seemed like a more reasonable task when She was younger , but with experience these decisions became more difficult . She composed complex formulas to weigh hundreds of factors , and ran computer programs that rolled out long strips of paper with eternal decisions . But Her sensitivities revolted at this automation  --  and when the computer generated a decision She disagreed with , She took the opportunity to kick out the plug in rage . That afternoon She listened to the grievances of the dead from two warring nations . Both sides had suffered , both sides had legitimate grievances , both pled their cases earnestly . She covered Her ears and moaned in misery . She knew Her humans were multidimensional , and She could no longer live under the rigid architecture of Her youthful choices . <br> Not all gods suffer over this ; we can consider ourselves lucky that in death we answer to a God with deep sensitivity to the byzantine hearts of Her creations . For months She moped around Her living room in Heaven , head drooped like a bulrush , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegate the decision making , but She loved Her humans too much to leave them to the care of anyone else . <br> In a moment of desperation the thought crossed Her mind to let everyone wait on line indefinitely , letting them work it out on their own . But then a better idea struck Her generous spirit . She could afford it : She would grant everyone , every last human , a place in Heaven . After all , everyone had something good inside ; it was part of the design specifications . Her new plan brought back the bounce to Her gait , returned the color to Her cheeks . She shut down the operations in Hell , fired the Devil , and brought every last human to be by Her side in Heaven . Newcomers or old-timers , nefarious or righteous : under the new system , everyone gets equal time to speak with Her . Most people find Her a little garrulous and oversolicitous , but She can not be accused of not caring . <br> The most important aspect of Her new system is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire for some and harp music for others . The afterlife is no longer defined by cots versus waterbeds , raw potatoes versus sushi , hot water versus champagne . Everyone is a brother to all , and for the first time an idea has been realized that never came to fruition on Earth : true equality . <br> The Communists are baffled and irritated , because they have finally achieved their perfect society , but only by the help of a God in whom they do n't want to believe . The meritocrats are abashed that they 're stuck for eternity in an incentiveless system with a bunch of pinkos . The conservatives have no penniless to disparage ; the liberals have no downtrodden to promote . <br> So God sits on the edge of Her bed and weeps at night , because the only thing everyone can agree upon is that they 're all in Hell . <br> Circle of Friends <br> When you die , you feel as though there were some subtle change , but everything looks approximately the same . You get up and brush your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the office . There is less traffic than normal . The rest of your building seems less full , as though it 's a holiday . But everyone in your office is here , and they greet you kindly . You feel strangely popular . Everyone you run into is someone you know . At some point , it dawns on you that this is the afterlife : the world is only made up of people you 've met before . <br> It 's a small fraction of the world population  --  about 0.00002 percent  --  but it seems like plenty to you . <br> It turns out that only the people you remember are here . So the woman with whom you shared a glance in the elevator may or may not be included . Your second-grade teacher is here , with most of the class . Your parents , your cousins , and your spectrum of friends through the years . All your old lovers . Your boss , your grandmothers , and the waitress who served your food each day at lunch . Those you dated , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is a blissful opportunity to spend quality time with your one thousand connections , to renew fading ties , to catch up with those you let slip away . <br> It is only after several weeks of this that you begin to feel forlorn . You wonder what 's different as you saunter through the vast quiet parks with a friend or two . No strangers grace the empty park benches . No family unknown to you throws bread crumbs for the ducks and makes you smile because of their laughter . <br> As you step into the street , you note there are no crowds , no buildings teeming with workers , no distant cities bustling , no hospitals running 24/7 with patients dying and staff rushing , no trains howling into the night with sardined passengers on their way home . Very few foreigners . You begin to consider all the things unfamiliar to you . You 've never known , you realize , how to vulcanize rubber to make a tire . And now those factories stand empty . You 've never known how to fashion a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the atmosphere , how to pit olives or lay railroad tracks . And now those industries are shut down . <br> The missing crowds make you lonely.You begin to complain about all the people you could be meeting . But no one listens or sympathizes with you , because this is precisely what you chose when you were alive . <br> Descent of Specie s <br> In the afterlife , you are treated to a generous opportunity : you can choose whatever you would like to be in the next life . Would you like to be a member of the opposite sex ? Born into royalty ? A philosopher with bottomless profundity ? A soldier facing triumphant battles ? <br> But perhaps you 've just returned here from a hard life . Perhaps you were tortured by the enormity of the decisions and responsibilities that surrounded you , and now there 's only one thing you yearn for : simplicity . That 's permissible . So for the next round , you choose to be a horse . You covet the bliss of that simple life : afternoons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your skeleton and the prominence of your muscles , the peace of the slow-flicking tail or the steam rifling through your nostrils as you lope across snow-blanketed plains . <br> You announce your decision . Incantations are muttered , a wand is waved , and your body begins to metamorphose into a horse . Your muscles start to bulge ; a mat of strong hair erupts to cover you like a comfortable blanket in winter . The thickening and lengthening of your neck immediately feels normal as it comes about . Your carotid arteries grow in diameter , your fingers blend hoofward , your knees stiffen , your hips strengthen , and meanwhile , as your skull lengthens into its new shape , your brain races in its changes : your cortex retreats as your cerebellum grows , the homunculus melts man to horse , neurons redirect , synapses unplug and replug on their way to equestrian patterns , and your dream of understanding what it is like to be a horse gallops toward you from the distance . Your concern about human affairs begins to slip away , your cynicism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thinking begins to drift away from you . <br> Suddenly , for just a moment , you are aware of the problem you overlooked . The more you become a horse , the more you forget the original wish . You forget what it was like to be a human wondering what it was like to be a horse . <br> This moment of lucidity does not last long . But it serves as the punishment for your sins , a Promethean entrails-pecking moment , crouching half-horse halfman , with the knowledge that you can not appreciate the destination without knowing the starting point ; you can not revel in the simplicity unless you remember the alternatives . And that 's not the worst of your revelation . You realize that the next time you return here , with your thick horse brain , you wo n't have the capacity to ask to become a human again . You wo n't understand what a human is . Your choice to slide down the intelligence ladder is irreversible . And just before you lose your final human faculties , you painfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of finding a simpler life , chose in the last round to become a human . <p>
