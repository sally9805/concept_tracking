Thirteen years ago , writer and director Richard Linklater released an indie flick with no plot , no stars , almost no budget ( $23,000 )  --  but plenty of conversation . That film , Slacker , became a cult hit and is coming out on DVD next week . Linklater , who is hard at work on A Scanner Darkly , with Keanu Reeves , talked with TIME 's Carolina A. Miranda . <P> Was it hard to get slackers to star in a film about slackers ? <P> It was fraught because you 're not paying anybody . I 'd say , " Show up at 6 a.m. because we have to shoot at dawn . " And people would saunter in on their own time . <P> Do you still consider yourself a slacker ? <P> I lost my status when the film got distribution , since I fit into the larger culture of supply and demand . <P> The DVD contains your unreleased first feature , It 's Impossible to Learn to Plow by Reading Books . What 's the idea there ? <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flip side of Slacker . It 's about a guy traveling around the country , but there 's not much dialogue . <P> In Slacker , a huckster tries to sell Madonna 's Pap smear . Ever hear from her ? <P> No . Originally , I did n't want to be steeped in pop culture because it 's fleeting . Then I figured , Madonna 's here to stay . I 'll let her be in my movie .
