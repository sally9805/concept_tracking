ABIGAIL BENNETT was the definition of unexpected . She was one year on the wrong side of the knife blade that was thirty , but if she turned up at your restaurant and ordered a glass of wine , even high-heeled and clad in a black sheath , you 'd card her every time . Petite and narrow-waisted , with a pixie flip of hair the exact color of coffee beans , Abigail could easily pass for sixteen in a pair of ripped jeans and an Abercrombie T-shirt . <p> Not that she liked looking younger than her age . In fact , most of the time Abigail hated the constant reminders that no matter what she did or where she went , she would not be taken seriously . This explained the harsh line of bobby pins that held her wayward hair out of her face as if the severity of it could add years . It also explained the almost-dowdy clothes , the earth-toned makeup , and the hard , thin line of a mouth that could have been very beautiful . <p> Once people got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abigail looked very much like the ideal kindergarten teacher . Her stature and dress were the opposite of intimidating , yet there was a spark in her dark eyes as if from time to time a match was struck behind the velvety chocolate of her corneas . These eyes could freeze hell over with a well-timed look , a piercing arrow of unmistakable meaning . But there was also the hint of tenderness in Abigail that translated into quiet strength when paired with the sharp edges that were inevitably unveiled before anyone had a chance to form a false opinion of her . But then again , maybe it was all a facade . She did n't let people get close enough to find out . <p> In reality , Abigail was not a kindergarten teacher , nor could she remember a phase in her life when she ever wanted to be one . She was an accountant . Numbers were stable , unchanging , and best of all , incapable of being mysterious or of forcing people to act and think and feel in ways that they would not normally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were not . And because Abigail trusted the reliability of her chosen field , she was good at her job , meticulous and capable of holding the smallest detail in her mind for as long as it was useful . <p> During tax season Abigail worked more hours than anyone else at her firm , and that was saying a lot . It was why she was made a partner after only five years with the company and why she occupied one of two corner offices , the one with a view of the swampy man-made pond that graced the complex of professional stucco buildings on Key Point Drive . Johnson , McNally &amp; Bennett was a Rosa Beach institution , and though Blake Johnson and Colton McNally could claim most of the honor behind their prestigious position in the community , Abigail knew she filled an important and indispensable role . Southern Florida had its share of widows and divorcTes , and for some not-so-surprising reasons they preferred to have a woman handle their money . Abigail was happy to oblige . It kept her busy and the firm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best . When she was n't working , which averaged sixty hours a week , she was either running or reheating days-old Chinese takeout in a dented wok . Both activities were little more than a personal experiment ; they were representative of the only two things in Abigail 's life that she really , deep down hoped to accomplish someday : run a marathon and learn to cook . <p> The marathon was a goal that she had already partly achieved . On the day of her twenty-ninth birthday , she ran a half marathon in Miami . Abigail could have easily completed it , and in fact , the finish line was in sight only two blocks ahead when she realized it was enough to know that she could do it . Crossing the finish line would have meant that she ran for someone else , that she ran for the glory , the recognition . <p> So Abigail had slowed down a little and then a bit more until someone thrust a cup of water in her hand and yelled , " You 're almost there ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded herself into the crowd while all eyes were watching the other runners throw their arms into the air for the last few triumphant yards . <p> The cooking , on the other hand , was little more than a pipe dream . Abigail 's greatest accomplishment was adding a diced chicken breast and some soy sauce to leftover chicken chow mein . It was too salty . But propped on her counter in an antique , wrought-iron bookstand was a Williams-Sonoma cookbook with full-color photographs and extensive instructions on how to cook home-made delicacies like potato gnocchi with wild mushroom sauce and baked clams with pine nuts and basil . Every morning , while she waited for the last few drops of coffee to drip into her Gevalia carafe , Abigail would thumb through the glossy pages of the cookbook and imagine what it would be like to make a wine reduction sauce as the sound of laughter filled her apartment . Someday , she told herself . <p> And though there were many somedays in Abigail 's life , she tried not to let the particulars of her existence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she did n't have a boyfriend . It did n't matter that every day plodded on with the same pitfalls and small successes . It did n't matter that her apartment was quiet but for the hum of her empty stainless steel refrigerator . It was the life that Abigail had chosen , and she was a grim optimist , resigned to the path she was on-she was getting exactly what she had always wanted . So what if it was tilted heavily toward work , personal discipline , solitude ? So what if it left little room for the things other people craved ? So what if her cupboards were as bare of exotic ingredients as her apartment was bare of cheerful company ? <p> But sometimes , alone in her apartment with the shades drawn tight , Abigail would stand in front of the full-length mirror on the back of her bathroom door and relax enough to admire what she saw . Tousling her wet hair and practicing a self-conscious smile that showed her teeth-her impossibly white , perfectly straight teeth that were a genetic legacy instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was ten years younger and that the world was unfurling itself before her . <p> For those moments in the steam and warmth , dark ringlets of hair curling around her temples as if she were some Grecian empress , Abigail wished much more for herself than what she had . She wished that she could rewind the clock and find Abby , the girl she used to be , perched on the cusp of her life instead of entrenched in the middle of it with no apparent way out . <p> Every once in a while , she could gather the courage to admit that it would be a very different life if she had it to do all over again . <p> * * * <p> When Abigail first came to Johnson &amp; McNally , she had a chance at a different life . <p> It was no secret around the office that Colton McNally had a thing for the new accountant . He was twelve years older than Abigail and divorced , and that seemed somehow estimable according to Abigail 's less-than-high expectations . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also did n't enter into much of anything with a long list of prerequisites . <p> In truth , Abigail found Colton very attractive . She thought his salt-and-pepper hair was distinguished-even though she suspected it came from the hands of a very talented colorist as he was n't quite forty-and she liked the way his tailored suits fell across the straight line of his shoulders . Best of all , he was nothing like the immature , self-absorbed boys Abigail had dated in college . They had nearly turned her off of men altogether . So when Colton turned his attention toward her , Abigail let him flirt . For a while , she even stopped wearing the stern bobby pins so that her dark curls framed her rather nicely arched forehead . <p> And yet Abigail was n't naive . She knew that her employer loved her because of the photo . It would have been too much to ask for Colton to love her , or at least think he did , because of herself . But while she probably should have been reticent of attention resulting from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - the source of Colton 's desire . <p> The photograph in question hung neatly squared and centered on a fabric-covered board adorning the west wall in the reception room . It was a concession to the more traditional bulletin board , replete with employee photographs that were intended to look candid but often looked overposed . <p> Abigail knew of the board , she even shot glances at it whenever she could to detect updates and changes , but she was not aware upon settling into her position that tradition dictated a spot for her photo front and center ASAP . <p> It was her third day of work , and Abigail was immersed in balancing infinitesimal details , worlds away from the air-conditioned office she inhabited when Colton startled her with a quiet " Ahem . " <p> Her head was bowed , and her forearms rested on endless pages that sprouted like an unruly crop of paper weeds across her generous desk . Abigail blinked and raised her eyes , just her eyes , in time to be blinded by the flash of Colton 's expensive Canon . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleared off her desk , sat up straight , and smiled , thin-lipped and toothy and even coy , trying them all in the hopes that one would be right . <p> But the next day , Abigail was surprised to see that the photo gracing the quasi bulletin board was the first of the batch . She knew she was looking at herself because seeing the small , hunched form over the crowded desk was a sort of dTja vu-she had been there before . If not for that , Abigail would have never believed that the woman staring back at her was her own reflection . The woman in the photograph had luminous-there was simply no other word for them- luminous black eyes of the starry-sky variety : endless and opalescent and dark like a time before the genesis . Like the event horizon of identical black holes-no way out , but no matter , for who would ever want to leave ? Beneath the twin universes of those eyes , her lips were slightly parted , pink and full and evocative of bruised raspberries . Her skin glowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ) , and her shadowy curls were framing and soft . The woman was lovely . <p> But what unnerved Abigail the most was that Colton had caught her at a moment between . A rare , uncovered moment between expressions : a moment of evaporation before the advent of her surprise became the dutiful smile that spread across her face in the split second after the shutter snapped . This woman was a living mystery . <p> Abigail wished she knew her . <p> * * * <p> One day , a few months after she started at the firm , Abigail went into Colton 's office to ask him a question about the tax return of a dual citizen living out of country . It was a legitimate question , but Blake 's office was closer than Colton 's , and her admirer acknowledged that fact the second Abigail rapped her knuckles on the doorframe . She realized almost too late that her presence would be read as an invitation , and sure enough , a smile unfolded across Colton 's face like a flag pulled taut in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Why do n't you close the door behind you ? There 's something I 've been meaning to talk to you about . " <p> Abigail did as she was told and crossed the plush , carpeted floor of Colton 's office with her heart stuck fast in her throat . <p> " But first- " Colton set aside what he had been working on- " what can I do for you ? " <p> Passing him the papers , Abigail lowered herself to balance on the arm of one of the leather chairs facing the wide , black walnut desk . But Colton raised an eyebrow at her , motioned that she should cross behind the desk to stand beside him . <p> They had flirted before , secret half smiles conveyed across crowded rooms and careful conversations littered with possibilities . And it seemed that the unmistakable chemistry between Colton and Abigail was a favorite topic around the watercooler , boasting far more people in favor of a match than against it . It was impossible for Abigail not to get caught up in it a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , with the door closed and Colton looking far more handsome than she remembered from only the day before , she knew that he was a man who would n't play games for long . <p> Colton waved her over again and Abigail moved slowly , explaining about the nonresident and his recent payout from a life insurance death benefit . She had just gotten to the part where he intended to give enough of it away to slip below the line of taxable income when Colton grabbed her wrist and , in one smooth movement , pulled her forward until her face was inches from his . He studied her , still smiling , then kissed her full on the mouth as if he had been intending to do so for a long time . <p> It was n't that Abigail did n't want to kiss him back . Actually quite the opposite . It was n't even that she was stunned by the inappropriateness of such a gesture . Instead , it was a Tic Tac that ruined everything , a burning little grain of peppermint that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew back , pulling out of Colton 's embrace and coughing violently until tears collected at the corners of her eyes . Abigail struggled for a moment , choking mutely as she watched Colton bolt out of his chair and grab her upper arms . When the breath mint was dislodged from her throat and she could feel it hot and peppery on her tongue , she knew it was a very small thing that would be significant in ways that might cause her years of lament . <p> " I 'm sorry , " Abigail murmured , utterly mortified for one of the first times she could remember . " I ... " She could n't continue . <p> Colton stared at her , concern and disbelief gathering foglike across his forehead . At first , Abigail thought he might fold her into his arms , that the almost-pitiable comedy of what had just happened would become the sort of story they laughed about months down the road when they told people the tale of how they came together . But then Colton laughed , rubbing his hands up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , disappearing in a shimmer of doubt that made Abigail wonder if she had merely dreamed it . <p> " As long as you 're okay , " he boomed . And then he sat back down and pretended nothing had happened . He never mentioned it again and neither did she . <p> Eighteen months later , Colton married Marguerite , the receptionist who was hired at the same time as Abigail . Marguerite was a few years younger than Abigail , but she looked much older due to a succession of bad dye jobs and what appeared to be a lifetime of sun damage spotting her skin . Colton seemed happy ; from what little Abigail could discern of her boss 's marriage , he genuinely longed for companionship and Marguerite 's horselike laugh did n't turn him off so much that he considered her a poor match . <p> Although it was against her nature , shortly after the happy couple 's beach wedding , Abigail went through a brief stage where she fixated on what might have been . The entire office had once been invited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Abigail could almost picture herself the mistress of his columned colonial . What sort of a woman would she be if she were Mrs. McNally ? What would she look like offering guests a second martini and lounging in some bright sari that she had bought on their honeymoon ? <p> It was a nice scenario , but Abigail was n't one to waste too much energy on regret , and she abandoned such nonsense the same way she set aside every other impossible dream : she placed it firmly out of her mind . A few years later when Blake and Colton approached her about being a partner , she was even able to congratulate herself that her business card would read Johnson , McNally &amp; Bennett instead of Johnson , McNally &amp; McNally . She convinced herself that it was much more satisfying this way . <p> For his part , after their less than romantic encounter in his office , Colton was nothing but a gentleman to Abigail . He treated her with the same respect , the same quiet yet somehow condescending pride of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the discarded role of a dependable daughter . It was a character she was rather good at playing . <p> * * * <p> Lou Bennett was a father when he could have been a grandfather . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
