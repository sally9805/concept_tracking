In the low-growth and ultracompetitive world of packaged foods , maintaining an empire can be just as difficult as building one . In 1999 , Kellogg Co. , the $9 billion behemoth that makes Frosted Flakes and Froot Loops  --  plus other consumables like Pop-Tarts , Nutri-Grain bars and Eggo waffles  --  lost its first-place cereal market share to rival General Mills . Carlos Gutierrez , who became CEO that year , led a massive revamp of the company that restored sales , morale and the No. 1 position . But in November , Gutierrez was poached to take over the Commerce Department , leaving board member Jim Jenness at the helm of Kellogg . The question is whether Jenness , who has never held an operational role at the company , based in Battle Creek , Mich. , can successfully follow a star CEO and keep the ball rolling . <P> At first glance , Jenness is an odd choice . He is a career adman who worked for decades at Leo Burnett before opening his own consulting firm . But delve a little deeper , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in disguise  --  and we 're not just talking about the time at an Atlanta sales convention when he donned a Tony the Tiger suit . From his first days at Leo Burnett , he worked on the Kellogg account . By 1985 , he was running all of his firm 's global Kellogg business , often traveling around the world with Kellogg 's marketing team or CEO . <P> In 2000 , Gutierrez asked Jenness to join the Kellogg board , where he became one of the more vocal advocates of the turnaround strategy . Kellogg had been suffering at the hands of consumers who were flocking to cheaper cereals  --  or finding other things to eat altogether . The company 's initial reaction was to discount , which only hurt the bottom line more . At the core of Gutierrez 's fix-it strategy was a shift in financial goals : instead of focusing on the number of pounds of product sold , executives started looking at performance in terms of dollars . As a result , the company put increased emphasis on more expensive items , such as Special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kellogg bought Keebler Foods ( to add brands like Cheez-It and play on Americans ' increasing tendency to eat on the go ) and made tough calls to control costs . <P> Going forward , Jenness will need to retain key players like COO David Mackay who were passed over for the top job . And then there is the challenge of anticipating Americans ' fickle eating habits . Jenness was in the boardroom for Kellogg 's reaction to the low-carb craze  --  cereals with a third less sugar and products like low-carb Eggos  --  but that trend is increasingly in the rearview mirror . What 's next ? General Mills is betting that broader health consciousness is here to stay and is in the process of converting its brands to whole grains . Kellogg will instead churn out a wide range of products , Jenness says , while focusing on creating more high-margin items , then funnel those profits back into more innovation . " Once you get something going , it takes tremendous discipline to keep it going , " says Jenness , a marathon runner . " Food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a wonderful thing and a challenge . " Now the challenge is all his .  --  By Barbara Kiviat
