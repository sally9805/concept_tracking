Headnote How to customize Vista , streamline your network , create an entertainment hub , and do much more-quickly and easily . Turn a PC Into an HD Media Server PC 's ARE GREAT at collecting and organizing media files , from digital camera photos to iTunes tracks to video downloads . But to get the most from your digital entertainment , you 'll want to enjoy it on your living-room stereo system or big-screen HDTV . That 's where media servers and player boxes come in : They provide the software and hardware interfaces you must have to access PC-based content directly from your TV screen . Media Center Software The first step in sharing content painlessly is getting the right software . Our top choice for the job is Microsoft 's competent and easy-to-use Windows Media Center , an HD-capable app included in Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate , as well as in Media Center Edition versions of XP . It plays back most media file types , including HD video and Windows DRM-protected content downloaded from online stores . It also streams Internet radio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so you can use your computer as a DVR . Getting started with Media Center is simple . When you open it for the first time , it scours your hard drives for media files , arranges them into such categories as Music , Pictures &; Videos , and TV &; Movies , and then serves them up via a point-and-click interface . Depending on how many files you have , you can set up Windows Media Center in a matter of minutes just by clicking through a few screens . You do n't need to do any organizing ahead of time , though you can designate which folders will be searched for media files , and for this reason you may want to segregate public content from private material . The program can also access network storage drives-if you 're in the market to purchase such a drive , look for a UPnP-enabled or " media storage " drive to make that process easier . The Jump to the Living Room Now comes the harder part : making the PC-to-TV connection , especially for HD video . To bridge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Media Center Extenders . Video travels from PC to Extender over a high-bandwidth ethcrnet or Wi-Fi connection , and then it goes from the Extender to the TV via special HDMI , DVI , or HD component cables . Thus far , however , the only Vista-compatible Extender with HD outputs is the Xbox 360 game console $300 ; more options are expected this fall . To set up Media Center on the Xbox 360 , go to www.xbox.com/pcsetup and select the download at the side of the page that corresponds to your Windows version . The Xbox 360 Universal Media Remote even has a dedicated Media Center button to make navigation easy . Be sure to hook up the Xbox 360 through the television 's high-definition connectors for best effect . Alternatives to Media Center If you do n't have Media Center already and do n't want to upgrade to Vista , all is not lost . Companies such as Buffalo , D-Link , and Netgear offer their own HD-capable media player boxes . We tested the Netgear Digital Entertainer HD ( $400 ) , which has both HD component @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ network connections . The Netgear device has PC software that , like Media Center , finds all the media files on your hard drive and delivers them to your TV in navigable categories . In addition to handling unprotected video , music , and picture files , the Netgear can play both protected iTunes music and Windows DRM content , something no other HD media player can do . Adding an HDTV Tuner If you also want to use your computer as a DVR to record and pause live TV , you can add an HDTV tuner to either a Media Center PC or the Netgear box . We tried the Pinnacle PCTV HD Pro Stick , a USB 2.0 device reminiscent of a thumb drive that comes with a portable antenna for picking up local digital and analog broadcasting ; you can use it with digital cable/satellite boxes for HD content , too-though you 'll take a quality hit , since it will hook up to your set-top box via an analog , not digital , connection . After installing the drivers , you can work within Windows Media Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , program guide , and recording options for the tuner . Finally , note that you will need plenty of disk space for high-definition recording : Best-quality HD MPEG-2 video runs about 1OGB per hour . And HD video streaming may require speeds of up to 25 megabits per second , so make sure you have a fast connection such as wired ethernet , 802.1 In Wi-Fi , or Home-Plug AV powerline networking . - Becky Waring Sidebar WINDOWS MEDIA Center automatically organizes your media files .
