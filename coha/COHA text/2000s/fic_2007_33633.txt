How it really began . . . You know that boy who lives a few doors down from you who 's just the creepiest person alive ? When you 're on your front porch , about to kiss your boyfriend good night , you might glimpse him across the street , just standing there . He 'll randomly appear when you 're gossiping with your best friends -- except maybe it 's not so random at all . He 's the black cat who seems to know your path . If he rides by your house , you think : I 'm going to fail my bio exam . If he looks at you funny , watch your back . Every town has a black-cat boy . In Rosewood , his name was Toby Cavanaugh . " I think she needs more blush . " Spencer Hastings leaned back and examined one of her best friends , Emily Fields . " I can still see her freckles . " " I 've got some Clinique concealer . " Alison DiLaurentis sprang up and ran to her blue corduroy makeup bag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Alison 's living room coffee table . She tilted her face one way , then another , and puckered her pink lips . " My mom would kill me if she saw me with all this stuff on . " " Yeah , but we 'll kill you if you take it off , " warned Aria Montgomery , who was , for her own Aria reasons , prancing around the room in a pink mohair bra she 'd recently knitted . " Yeah , Em , you look awesome , " Hanna Marin agreed . Hanna satcross-legged on the floor and kept swiveling around to check that her crack was n't sticking out of her low-rise , slightly-too-small Blue Cult jeans . It was a Friday night in April , and Ali , Aria , Emily , Spencer , and Hanna were having one of their typical sixth-grade sleepovers : putting way too much makeup on each other , chowing on sea salt and vinegar Kettle chips , and half-watching MTV Cribs on Ali 's flat-screen TV . Tonight there was the addition of everyone 's clothes spread out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the rest of their sixth-grade school year . Spencer held up a lemon-yellow cashmere cardigan to her slender torso . " Take it , " Ali told her . " It 'll look cute on you . " Hanna pulled an olive corduroy skirt of Ali 's around her hips , turned to Ali , and struck a pose . " What do you think ? Would Sean like it ? " Ali groaned and smacked Hanna with a pillow . Ever since they 'd become friends in September , all Hanna could talk about was how much she looooved Sean Ackard , a boy in their class at Rosewood Day School , where they 'd all been going since kindergarten . In fifth grade , Sean had been just another short , freckled guy in their class , but over the summer , he 'd grown a couple inches and lost his baby fat . Now , pretty much every girl wanted to kiss him . It was amazing how much could change in a year . The girls -- everyone but Ali -- knew that all too well . Last year , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beranal girl who sat at the front of the class and raised her hand at every question . Aria was the slightly freaky girl who made up dance routines instead of playing soccer like everyone else . Emily was the shy , state-ranked swimmer who had a lot going on under the surface -- if you just got to know her . And Hanna might 've been klutzy and bumbling , but she studied Vogue and Teen Vogue and every once in a while she 'd blurt out something totally random about fashion that no one else knew . There was something special about all of them , sure , but they lived in Rosewood , Pennsylvania , a suburb twenty miles outside Philadelphia , and everything was special in Rosewood . Flowers smelled sweeter , water tasted better , houses were just plain bigger . People joked that the squirrels spent their nights cleaning up litter and weeding errant dandelions from the cobblestone sidewalks so Rosewood would look perfect for its demanding residents . In a place where everything looked so flawless , it was hard to stand out . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart-shaped face and huge blue eyes , she was the most stunning girl around . After Ali united them in friendship --  sometimes it felt like she 'd discovered them -- the girls were definitely more than just there . Suddenly , they had an all-access pass to do things they 'd never dared before . Like changing into short skirts in the Rosewood Day girls ' bathroom after they got off the bus in the morning . Or passing boys ChapStick-kissed notes in class . Or walking down the Rosewood Day hallway in an intimidating line , ignoring all the losers . Ali grabbed a tube of shimmery purple lipstick and smeared it all over her lips . " Who am I ? " The others groaned -- Ali was imitating Imogen Smith , a girl in their class who was a little bit too in love with her Nars lipstick . " No , wait . " Spencer pursed her bow-shaped lips and handed Ali a pillow . " Put this up your shirt . " " Nice . " Ali stuffed it under her pink polo , and everyone giggled some more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jeffery Klein , a tenth grader , and she was having his baby . " You guys are awful . " Emily blushed . She was the most demure of the group , maybe because of her superstrict upbringing -- her parents thought anything fun was evil . " What , Em ? " Ali linked her arm around Emily 's elbow . " Imogen 's looking awfully fat -- she should hope she 's pregnant . " The girls laughed again , but a little uneasily . Ali had a talent for finding a girl 's weakness , and even if Ali was right about Imogen , the girls all sometimes wondered if Ali was ever ripping on them when they were n't around . Sometimes it was hard to know for sure . They settled back into sorting through one another 's clothes . Aria fell in love with an ultrapreppie Fred Perry dress of Spencer 's . Emily slid a denim miniskirt up her skinny legs and asked everyone if it was too short . Ali declared a pair of Hanna 's Joe 's jeans too bell-bottomy and slid them off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past the window to the stereo , she froze . " Oh my God ! " she screamed , running behind the blackberry-colored velvet couch . The girls wheeled around . At the window was Toby Cavanaugh . He was just . . . standing there . Staring at them .
