Some 50 scientists from 13 countries , all members of the International Geophysical Year 's conference on rockets and satellites , had gathered , along with a handful of journalists , for cocktails that night at the Soviet embassy on Washington 's Sixteenth Street . New York Times science reporter Walter Sullivan was called to the phone and told that Moscow had announced that it had put a satellite into orbit . He hurried back and whispered the news in the ear of U.S. physicist Lloyd Berkner , who rapped on the hors d'oeuvre table until the hubbub quieted and dramatically declared to the unknowing and startled group , including the Russians , " A satellite is in orbit at an elevation of 900 km . I wish to congratulate our Soviet colleagues on their achievement . " <P> Washington changed in those next few hours . The U.S. , which had assumed scientific pre-eminence , had been beaten in the opening lap of the space race . Before the night was over the Russians had fueled themselves with vodka and stood curbside in front of their embassy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> I did n't go to bed that night , rushing from the Soviet embassy to Capitol Hill to the White House . Those at the center of the power game knew their lives had changed . At the Naval Research Laboratory , which was in charge of America 's entry in the space race , Project Vanguard , the engineers bathed the roof in searchlights so they could adjust their radio dishes to pick up the defiant beep from Sputnik , the 184-lb. intruder that had not only humiliated the U.S. but ratcheted up the cold war . The Soviet rockets obviously were bigger and better than we knew . <P> The White House feigned indifference , and reassured the nation about American scientific prowess . Some of the U.S. 's top scientists , like M.I.T. 's Vannevar Bush , took refuge behind closed doors until they could figure out what to say . Worry seeped through the nation , always uncomfortable with second place . The U.S. hurried its thin , finely engineered rocket , with a satellite , to the launching pad two months later . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gentle astronomer John Hagen , who headed Project Vanguard , sucked on his ever present pipe and rightly pointed out that U.S. space science was more sophisticated than that of the Soviets . But by then the game had moved beyond pure science . <P> Two young and driven politicians took notice . Senate majority leader Lyndon Johnson seized the moment of doubt and pushed the U.S. space program forward in Congress . Senator John Kennedy saw space as the next great national adventure , and when he became President four years later , he decided to land Americans on the moon .
