Chapter One Harper House January 2004 She could n't afford to be intimidated by the house , or by its mistress . They both had reputations . The house was said to be elegant and old , with gardens that rivaled Eden . She 'd just confirmed that for herself . The woman was said to be interesting , somewhat solitary , and perhaps a bit " difficult . " A word , Stella knew , that could mean anything from strong-willed to stone bitch . Either way , she could handle it , she reminded herself as she fought the need to get up and pace . She 'd handled worse . She needed this job . Not just for the salary-and it was generous-but for the structure , for the challenge , for the doing . Doing more , she knew , than circling the wheel she 'd fallen into back home . She needed a life , something more than clocking time , drawing a paycheck that would be soaked up by bills . She needed , however self-help-book it sounded , something that fulfilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sure . A beautiful ancestral home , a thriving business . What was it like , she wondered , to wake up every morning knowing exactly where you belonged and where you were going ? If she could earn one thing for herself , and give that gift to her children , it would be the sense of knowing . She was afraid she 'd lost any clear sight of that with Kevin 's death . The sense of doing , no problem . Give her a task or a challenge and the room to accomplish or solve it , she was your girl . But the sense of knowing who she was , in the heart of herself , had been mangled that day in September of 2001 and had never fully healed . This was her start , this move back to Tennessee . This final and face-to-face interview with Rosalind Harper . If she did n't get the job-well , she 'd get another . No one could accuse her of not knowing how to work or how to provide a living for herself and her kids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She straightened her shoulders and tried to ignore all the whispers of doubt muttering inside her head . She 'd get this one . She 'd dressed carefully for this meeting . Businesslike but not fussy , in a navy suit and starched white blouse . Good shoes , good bag , she thought . Simple jewelry . Nothing flashy . Subtle makeup , to bring out the blue of her eyes . She 'd fought her hair into a clip at the nape of her neck . If she was lucky , the curling mass of it would n't spring out until the interview was over . Rosalind was keeping her waiting . It was probably a mind game , Stella decided as her fingers twisted , untwisted her watchband . Letting her sit and stew in the gorgeous parlor , letting her take in the lovely antiques and paintings , the sumptuous view from the front windows . All in that dreamy and gracious southern style that reminded her she was a Yankee fish out of water . Things moved slower down here , she reminded herself . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the one she was used to , and a different culture . The fireplace was probably an Adams , she decided . That lamp was certainly an original Tiffany . Would they call those drapes portieres down here , or was that too Scarlett O'Hara ? Were the lace panels under the drapes heirlooms ? God , had she ever been more out of her element ? What was a middle-class widow from Michigan doing in all this southern splendor ? She steadied herself , fixed a neutral expression on her face , when she heard footsteps coming down the hall . " Brought coffee . " It was n't Rosalind , but the cheerful man who 'd answered the door and escorted Stella to the parlor . He was about thirty , she judged , average height , very slim . He wore his glossy brown hair waved around a movie-poster face set off by sparkling blue eyes . Though he wore black , Stella found nothing butlerlike about it . Much too artsy , too stylish . He 'd said his name was David . He set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linen napkins , the sugar and cream , and the tiny vase with its clutch of violets on the coffee table . " Roz got a bit hung up , but she 'll be right along , so you just relax and enjoy your coffee . You comfortable in here ? " " Yes , very . " " Anything else I can get you while you 're waiting on her ? " " No . Thanks . " " You just settle on in , then , " he ordered , and poured coffee into a cup . " Nothing like a fire in January , is there ? Makes you forget that a few months ago it was hot enough to melt the skin off your bones . What do you take in your coffee , honey ? " She was n't used to being called " honey " by strange men who served her coffee in magnificent parlors . Especially since she suspected he was a few years her junior . " Just a little cream . " She had to order herself not to stare at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , those sapphire eyes , the strong cheekbones , the sexy little dent in the chin . " Have you worked for Ms. Harper long ? " " Forever . " He smiled charmingly and handed her the coffee . " Or it seems like it , in the best of all possible ways . Give her a straight answer to a straight question , and do n't take any bullshit . " His grin widened . " She hates it when people kowtow . You know , honey , I love your hair . " " Oh . " Automatically , she lifted a hand to it . " Thanks . " " Titian knew what he was doing when he painted that color . Good luck with Roz , " he said as he started out . " Great shoes , by the way . " She sighed into her coffee . He 'd noticed her hair and her shoes , complimented her on both . Gay . Too bad for her side . It was good coffee , and David was right . It was nice having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moist and raw , with a broody sky overhead . A woman could get used to a winter hour by the fire drinking good coffee out of-what was it ? Meissen , Wedgwood ? Curious , she held the cup up to read the maker 's mark . " It 's Staffordshire , brought over by one of the Harper brides from England in the mid-nineteenth century . " No point in cursing herself , Stella thought . No point in cringing about the fact that her redhead 's complexion would be flushed with embarrassment . She simply lowered the cup and looked Rosalind Harper straight in the eye . " It 's beautiful . " " I 've always thought so . " She came in , plopped down in the chair beside Stella 's , and poured herself a cup . One of them , Stella realized , had miscalculated the dress code for the interview . Rosalind had dressed her tall , willowy form in a baggy olive sweater and mud-colored work pants that were frayed at the cuffs . She was shoeless , with a pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounted , Stella supposed , for her silent entry into the room . Her hair was short , straight , and black . Though to date all their communications had been via phone , fax , or e-mail , Stella had Googled her . She 'd wanted background on her potential employer-and a look at the woman . Newspaper and magazine clippings had been plentiful . She 'd studied Rosalind as a child , through her youth . She 'd marveled over the file photos of the stunning and delicate bride of eighteen and sympathized with the pale , stoic-looking widow of twenty-five . There had been more , of course . Society-page stuff , gossipy speculation on when and if the widow would marry again . Then quite a bit of press surrounding the forging of the nursery business , her gardens , her love life . Her brief second marriage and divorce . Stella 's image had been of a strong-minded , shrewd woman . But she 'd attributed those stunning looks to camera angles , lighting , makeup . She 'd been wrong . At forty-six , Rosalind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hothouse sort , Stella mused , but one that weathered the elements , season after season , and came back , year after year , stronger and more beautiful . She had a narrow face angled with strong bones and deep , long eyes the color of single-malt scotch . Her mouth , full , strongly sculpted lips , was unpainted-as , to Stella 's expert eye , was the rest of that lovely face . There were lines , those thin grooves that the god of time reveled in stamping , fanning out from the corners of the dark eyes , but they did n't detract . All Stella could think was , Could I be you , please , when I grow up ? Only I 'd like to dress better , if you do n't mind . " Kept you waiting , did n't I ? " Straight answers , Stella reminded herself . " A little , but it 's not much of a hardship to sit in this room and drink good coffee out of Staffordshire . " " David likes to fuss . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her voice , Stella thought , was brisk . Not clipped-you just could n't clip Tennessee-but it was to the point and full of energy . " You look younger than I expected . You 're what , thirty-three ? " " Yes . " " And your sons are ... six and eight ? " " That 's right . " " You did n't bring them with you ? " " No . They 're with my father and his wife right now . " " I 'm very fond of Will and Jolene . How are they ? " " They 're good . They 're enjoying having their grandchildren around . " " I imagine so . Your daddy shows off pictures of them from time to time and just about bursts with pride . " " One of my reasons for relocating here is so they can have more time together . " " It 's a good reason . I like young boys myself . Miss having them around . The fact that you come with two played in your favor . Your rsum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employer-well , none of that hurt . " She picked up a cookie from the tray , bit in , without her eyes ever leaving Stella 's face . " I need an organizer , someone creative and hardworking , personable and basically tireless . I like people who work for me to keep up with me , and I set a strong pace . " " So I 've been told . " Okay , Stella thought , brisk and to the point in return . " I have a degree in nursery management . With the exception of three years when I stayed home to have my children-and during which time I landscaped my own yard and two neighbors ' -I 've worked in that capacity . For more than two years now , since my husband 's death , I 've raised my sons and worked outside the home in my field . I 've done a good job with both . I can keep up with you , Ms. Harper . I can keep up with anyone . " Maybe , Roz thought . Just maybe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ irked , Stella held them out . Roz set down her coffee , took them in hers . She turned them palms up , ran her thumbs over them . " You know how to work . " " Yes , I do . " " Banker suit threw me off . Not that it is n't a lovely suit . " Roz smiled , then polished off the cookie . " It 's been damp the last couple of days . Let 's see if we can put you in some boots so you do n't ruin those very pretty shoes . I 'll show you around . " The boots were too big , and the army-green rubber hardly flattering , but the damp ground and crushed gravel would have been cruel to her new shoes . Her own appearance hardly mattered when compared with the operation Rosalind Harper had built . In the Garden spread over the west side of the estate . The garden center faced the road , and the grounds at its entrance and running along the sides of its parking area were beautifully landscaped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and creativity put into the presentation with the selection and placement of evergreens and ornamental trees , the mulched rises where she assumed there would be color from bulbs and perennials , from splashy annuals through the spring and summer and into fall . After one look she did n't want the job . She was desperate for it . The lust tied knots of nerves and desire in her belly , the kinds that were usually reserved for a lover . " I did n't want the retail end of this near the house , " Roz said as she parked the truck . " I did n't want to see commerce out my parlor window . Harpers are , and always have been , business-minded . Even back when some of the land around here was planted with cotton instead of houses . " Because Stella 's mouth was too dry to speak , she only nodded . The main house was n't visible from here . A wedge of natural woods shielded it from view and kept the long , low outbuildings , the center itself , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on any view from Harper House . And just look at that gorgeous old ruby horse chestnut ! " This section 's open to the public twelve months a year , " Roz continued . " We carry all the sidelines you 'd expect , along with houseplants and a selection of gardening books . My oldest son 's helping me manage this section , though he 's happier in the greenhouses or out in the field . We 've got two part-time clerks right now . We 'll need more in a few weeks . " Get your head in the game , Stella ordered herself . " Your busy season would start in March in this zone . " " That 's right . " Roz led the way to the low-slung white building , up an asphalt ramp , across a spotlessly clean porch , and inside . Two long , wide counters on either side of the door , Stella noted . Plenty of light to keep it cheerful . There were shelves stocked with soil additives , plant foods , pesticides , spin racks of seeds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herbs or windowsill plants . There were displays of wind chimes , garden plaques , and other accessories . A woman with snowy white hair dusted a display of sun catchers . She wore a pale blue cardigan with roses embroidered down the front over a white shirt that looked to have been starched stiff as iron . " Ruby , this is Stella Rothchild . I 'm showing her around . " " Pleased to meet you . " The calculating look told Stella the woman knew she was in about the job opening , but the smile was perfectly cordial . " You 're Will Dooley 's daughter , are n't you ? " " Yes , that 's right . " " From ... up north . " She said it , to Stella 's amusement , as if it were a Third World country of dubious repute . " From Michigan , yes . But I was born in Memphis . " " Is that so ? " The smile warmed , fractionally . " Well , that 's something , is n't it ? Moved away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , with my mother . " " Thinking about moving back now , are you ? " " I have moved back , " Stella corrected . " Well . " The one word said they 'd see what they 'd see . " It 's a raw one out there today , " Ruby continued . " Good day to be inside . You just look around all you want . " " Thanks . There 's hardly anywhere I 'd rather be than inside a nursery . " " You picked a winner here . Roz , Marilee Booker was in and bought the dendrobium . I just could n't talk her out of it . " " Well , shit . It 'll be dead in a week . " " Dendrobiums are fairly easy care , " Stella pointed out . " Not for Marilee . She does n't have a black thumb . Her whole arm 's black to the elbow . That woman should be barred by law from having anything living within ten feet of her . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise to bring it back if it starts to look sickly . " " Not your fault . " Roz waved it away , then moved through a wide opening . Continues ...
