<p> " I had a dream <p> we were all equal , <p> all God 's people . <p> Look past the color <p> of our flesh , <p> into the hearts <p> of his people . . . "  --  From Visions , a song by Kobe Bryant <p> LOS ANGELES  --  Kobe Bryant has a vision . It 's not just about helping the Los Angeles Lakers win the 1999-2000 NBA Championship and establishing himself , at age 21 and just 3 1/2 years removed from Lower Merion ( Pa . ) High School , as one of the premier shooting guards in the league . <p> It certainly is not about accumulating great wealth or hoarding material possessions , even though he 's signed to a $ 71 million contract and owns a six-bedroom home overlooking the ocean in Pacific Palisades . <p> It never has been about emblazoning his body with tattoos , piercing every inch of his flesh or traveling with an entourage . <p> Why , until a year or so ago , his parents , Joe " Jelly Bean " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still his closest confidant , and there 's nothing better than his mom 's macaroni and cheese . His idea of a good time ? Reading Dante 's Inferno  --  in Italian . <p> No , Bryant 's vision is much bigger  --  and deeper  --  than professional basketball . It 's global , multicultural , multilingual and multimedial . It 's humanistic and humanitarian . <p> Take a peek . <p> Bryant is sitting in a courtside chair in an empty Staples Center , after a game-day practice several weeks ago . Over the course of the next hour , he 'll speak in Italian , French , German and Spanish , all of which will come in handy , now that he 's a co-owner of Olimpia Milano , one of the most storied professional basketball teams in Europe . He 'll recite the lyrics of some of the 16 rap songs he wrote for Visions , his soon-to-be released CD from Columbia records . He 'll talk about having designed the new Kobe line of shoes for adidas in funky colors such as champagne and baby blue . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrice-weekly journal for his kobebryant.com Web site . And he 'll blush when asked about the number of members in the Kobe Klub , his wildly successful fan club . <p> The membership dues , which range from $ 4.95 to $ 99.95 a year , are donated to his non-profit Kobe Bryant Foundation , which targets at-risk kids in the Los Angeles area . <p> With that money , along with proceeds raised in two celebrity bowling tournaments , Bryant built the ERAS Center in Culver City , outfitted a computer room at Hollygrove Center and sponsored a bookmobile with tutors , which traveled throughout East L.A. <p> So , what do you have  --  25,000 fans in your fan club ? <p> Bryant remains silent . <p> A couple hundred thousand ? Bryant does n't flinch . <p> A million ? " Nah , more than that , " Bryant replies , sheepishly , not wanting to appear boastful . <p> Building blocks <p> Bryant is the NBA 's poster child for the 21st century , as well as the beacon of hope for male and female professional athletes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peach-fuzz goatee on his baby face , he already is skyrocketing toward a universe about which most jocks can only dream . <p> Bryant is patiently and thoughtfully building a multifaceted and interrelated international business career , with little more than a high school diploma , a slightly above-average SAT score and an introductory Italian course he took at UCLA 's summer school a few years ago . <p> How many athletes can cause a near-riot at an autograph signing in a Philippines shopping mall ? " I thought we were going to die , " recalls Jim Gatto , basketball promotions manager for adidas . " There were kids hanging over the edge on three different levels of the mall . We had trouble getting out of there . " <p> And how many players have Hot Wheels Radical Ride action figures in their likeness ? " He understands how special that is , " says Meredith Ashley , associate product manager for Mattel . " After all , he 's only 10 years removed from toys . " <p> The business of Kobe <p> All of that makes the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Lakers , averaging 22.5 points , and tops in assists ( 4.3 ) and steals ( 1.5 ) seem mundane . <p> " Kobe 's wise beyond his years , and he has incredible business instincts , " says his agent , Arn Tellum , of SFX Sports . " His goal  --  and I never thought it would happen this quickly  --  was to move from a celebrity endorser/spokesperson to having an ownership in the companies in which he has an interest or a passion . " <p> Offers Kobe 's father , Joe : " We , as the public , have watched Kobe grow up . How many people can you say that about ? We 've seen the great things , as well as the mistakes . He 's a little different , but it 's OK to be different . Kobe plays at a level only a few have ever played at . " <p> Adds Kobe : " Hell , yes , I 've gone through growing pains . People do n't always understand my vision . They ca n't see what I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it or not . " <p> Seeing the world through Bryant 's eyes is , well , eye-opening . And , at times , mind-boggling . <p> Let 's start with his elaborate Web site . Maneuvering around it becomes an hour-long adventure . He gets about 5 million hits a month , receives correspondence from 6-year-olds who can barely write to grandmothers who are rabid Lakers fans , and collects acquaintances from the far corners . Asia . Africa . Europe . Australia . <p> He responds to all sorts of personal questions ( no , he 's not dating anybody seriously ) , posts snippets of songs from his new CD and is getting ready to post a beat , then ask his fans to submit their lyrics to it . <p> And he starts all sorts of cool contests , too . Such as Kobe 's Reading Club . A few months ago , he got to thinking how much he loved having his parents read to him , so he decided to encourage kids to read some of his favorites , promising to be right beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ e-mail book reports . Last month , Kobe and his kids were reading , Oh , The Places You 'll Go . This month , it 's Curious George , and Ben Carson , an autobiography of a pioneering African-American neurosurgeon . <p> Then there are Bryant 's commercial endorsements . <p> One moment , he 's encased in a Lycra suit , with reflective balls attached to all of his joints , performing amazing basketball moves for eight grueling hours , as six cameras capture the motion for Nintendo 's Courtside 2 video game . <p> And yet another , he 's on a two-week trip to Asia for adidas , the shoe and apparel company that has made him the second-most important athlete endorser in the world behind Michael Jordan . He 's eating beef with the mayor of Kobe , Japan . He 's performing dunks , in street clothes , at halftime of the national amateur championship game in the Philippines . He 's going one-on-one against a top salesman in Minneapolis . <p> The second of three children and the only son of Joe and Pamela @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a defensive specialist for the 76ers . His parents named him after a Kobe Steakhouse in King of Prussia , Pa. , and when Kobe was 3 , Joe set up a mini-goal and placed a basketball in his hands . <p> Two years later , after finishing his NBA career with Houston in 1984 , Joe moved the family to Italy , where he played for four Italian teams over the next eight years . <p> Jelly Bean became a popular cult figure , and the Italians , who were passionate about their basketball clubs , dressed in team colors , waved team flags and fashioned songs with their praises of Bryant . <p> Learning experiences <p> The experience of living overseas , in little towns where they were not just the only Americans but the only African-Americans , drew the Bryants closer as a family . " In that environment , where few people spoke English , we communicated a lot more , " Joe says . <p> The Bryants enrolled their children in Italian parochial schools , rather than an English-speaking school . <p> " It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was learning to read and write in first grade , so were all the other kids . It 's just that we were all doing it in Italian . " <p> Joe taught him technical basketball skills , as well as American street tricks , and Kobe studied videos of NBA games , along with Michael Jordan 's Come Fly With Me , that relatives in Philadelphia regularly shipped over . <p> Bryant spent hours by himself , perfecting his moves on grassy soccer fields . When the local kids would invade his make-believe games , he was often forced into playing goalie . <p> " Growing up in Italy , I became more of an individual , " Bryant says . " The hardest thing in life is to know yourself and to master your own emotions . And I learned those things at a very young age . " <p> When Kobe was 13 , the Bryants moved to Philadelphia , where Joe took a job coaching at LaSalle University . But Kobe did n't automatically fit right back in . In fact , the family lived in affluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the few black kids did n't take him seriously . Not only did n't he speak English very well , he had an Italian accent . <p> The value of being a strong individual was impressed upon him once again . " How did I adapt to Philly ? I did n't , " Bryant says . " I was just myself . <p> " I got my butt kicked in basketball because everything in Philly was more physical and up-tempo . The beat was a little different . So , I learned to create my own beat . " <p> Joe arranged for Kobe to work out with the 76ers , and he eventually caught up , leading Lower Merion to the Class AAAA state title in 1996 . He was named USA TODAY 's High School Player of the Year . <p> Coveted by every major college program , Bryant narrowed his choices to North Carolina , Duke , Kentucky , Michigan and LaSalle . But before he could sign a letter of intent , a strong , clear voice inside Bryant told him to aim higher . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all seems so long ago . Not to mention a bit surrealistic . Especially in early December , when Bryant , in a move that is unprecedented for an active American athlete , spent more than $ 1 million to purchase 50% of Olimpia Milano . Joe is currently heading up the basketball operations , shuttling to Europe every two weeks , while Kobe plans to work there in the offseason . <p> Owning an Italian team was a goal that Bryant always had envisioned . Just as he hopes to one day get married , retire from the NBA , move to Italy and raise his own family . <p> " I 've got a vision , but exactly what it encompasses and where it will lead , I 'm not sure , " Bryant says . " I just want everybody to sit back and enjoy the ride . "
