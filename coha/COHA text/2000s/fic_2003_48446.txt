AFTERWARD , IT WAS NEVER the people she remembered , never faces or bodies or voices - even Alfredo 's . It was always the wind , blowing from the west side of the island , and the frigate birds , balanced on their wingtips against the sky . They flew high above her , so black and stark they seemed made of leather or scales , too finely drawn to be feathered . <p> It was March , the beginning of the rainy season , and she had come to Isla Muieres to leave her husband . That she had done this some half a dozen times before did not escape her and she had a kind of despairing fatalism about it . Probably this time , too , she would return . Her name was Jean Summat . Her husband , Marc , lived the professor 's life in Boston . She , it was supposed , was to five the role of professor 's wife . This was something she bad never quite accepted . <p> Isla Mujeres . Island of Women . <p> She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water , waiting for her first meal on the island . In a few minutes it came . A whole fish stared glassily up at her from the plate . Delicately , she began to carve small pieces from it , and ate . She glanced up and a Mexican man in a Panama hat smiled at her . She looked back to her food , embarrassed . <p> Boston was cold right now and covered with a wet snow as raw as butcher 's blood . But here in Mexico , it was warm . More importantly , it was cheap and people 's lives here were still enmeshed in basics , not intricately curved in academic diplomacy . <p> She left the restaurant and stood on the pier watching the birds , feeling the warm heavy wind , sour with the hot smell of the sea . The late afternoon sun was masked with low clouds and in the distance was a dark blue rain . She had a room , money , and time . <p> THE AVENIDA RUEDA was clotted with vendors selling Mayan trinkets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Several vendors tried to attract her attention with an " Amiga ! " but she ignored them . A Mexican dressed in a crisp suit and Panama hat sat in an outdoor cafe and sipped his drink as he watched her . just watched her . <p> Lots of Mexicans wear such hats , she told herself . Still , he made her nervous and she left the street to return to her room . On the balcony she watched the frigate birds and the people on the beach . <p> Jean swam in the warm water of Playa de Cocoa . When she came from the water she saw the man watching her from one of the cabanas as he sipped a Coke . She walked up to him . <p> " Why are you following me ? " <p> The man sipped his Coke and looked back at her . " No entiende . " <p> She looked at him carefully . " That 's a lie . " <p> There was a long moment of tension . He threw back his head and laughed . " Es verdad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing ? " <p> " You are very beautiful , Senora . " <p> " Jesus ! " <p> " You need a man . " <p> " I have a man . " Or half a man . Or maybe more than a man . Do I still have him ? Do I want him ? Did I ever ? <p> " With specifications ? " <p> She stared at him . <p> Hector led her through the rubble at the end of the Avenida Hidalgo to a small concrete house nearly identical to all the other concrete houses on the island . It was surrounded by a wall . Set into the top of the wall were the jagged spikes of broken soda bottles . She looked down the street . The other houses were built the same . There was a burnt-out car leaning against one wall , and a thin dog stared at her , his eyes both hungry and protective . <p> Inside , it smelled damp . It was dark for a moment , then he turned on a blue fluorescent light that lit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wall was a tall , long-haired and heavily built man with Mayan features . He did not move . <p> What am I doing here ? <p> " This is Alfredo . " Hector was looking at her with a considering expression . <p> She shook her head . The air in the room seemed thick , lifeless , cut off from the world . " Alfredo ? " <p> " Alfredo . I show you . " Hector opened a suitcase and took out a box with a complex control panel . He flipped two switches and turned a dial and the box hummed . Alfredo pushed himself away from the wall and looked around . <p> " Good God . " She stared at him . Alfredo was beautiful , with a high forehead and strong lips . His body was wide and taut , the muscles rippling as he moved . Hector touched a button and he became absolutely still . <p> " You like him ? " <p> She turned to Hector startled . She 'd forgotten he was there . " What is this ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke in a deep conspiratorial whisper . " Deep in the mountains north of Mexico City is a great research laboratory . They have built many of these - andros ? Syntheticos ? " <p> " Androids . " <p> " Of course . They are stronger and more beautiful than mortal men . But the church discovered it and forced them to close it down . The church is important here - " <p> " That 's a lie . " <p> Hector shrugged . " The Senora is correct . Alfredo was a prisoner in the Yucatan . Condemned to die for despicable crimes . They did not kill him , however . Instead , they removed his mind and inlaid his body with electrical circuits . He is now more than a man <p> " That 's another he . " <p> " The Senora sees most clearly . " He paused a moment . " You have heard of the Haitian zombie ? The Mayans had a similar process . My country has only recently perfected it , coupling it with the most advanced of scientific - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped , then shrugged . " What does it matter , Senora ? He is empty . His mind does not exist . He will - imprint ? Is that the correct word ? - on anyone I choose . " <p> " This is a trick . " <p> " You are so difficult to convince . Let me show you his abilities . " Hector manipulated the controls and Alfredo leaped forward and caught himself on one hand , holding himself high in the air with the strength of one arm . He flipped forward onto his feet . Alfredo picked up a branch from a pile of kindling and twisted it in both hands . There was no expression on his face but the muscles in his forearms twisted like snakes , the tendons like dark wires . The branch broke with a sudden gunshot report . <p> Hector stopped Alfredo at attention before them . " You see ? He is more than man . " <p> She shook her head . " What kind of act is this ? " <p> " No act . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maestro ? would not need this . " <p> Control . Such control . <p> Hector seemed uncertain for a moment . " You wish to see still more ? You are unsure of how he is controlled ? " He thought for a moment . " Let me show you a feature . " <p> In the stark light and shadows , she had not noticed Alfredo was nude . The Mayan turned into the light . <p> " There are several choices one could make when using Alfredo . " Hector manipulated the box . " Pequeno . " <p> Alfredo had a normal sized erection . <p> She wanted to look away and could not . The Mayan face was before her , dark , strong , and blank . <p> " Medio , " said Hector softly . <p> She looked again and the erection was twice as large , pulsing to Alfredo 's breathing . <p> " Y monstruoso ! " cried Hector . <p> Alfredo looked fit to be a bull , a goat , or some other animal . There was never any expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Hector . And Alfredo 's erection wilted and disappeared . <p> She could n't breathe . She wanted to run , to hide from Alfredo , but she did n't want to be anywhere else . <p> " You are pleased , Senora ? " Hector stood beside her . <p> Jean tried to clear her head . She looked away from both of them . No man could fake this . It was real , a marvelous control , a total subjugation . Was this what she had wanted all this time ? <p> " A very nice show . " She took a deep breath . " How much do I owe you ? " <p> " You owe me nothing , Senora . " Hector bowed to her . " But Alfredo is for sale . " When she did not answer immediately , he continued . " He imprints on the owner , Senora . Then voice commands are sufficient . He will show initiative if you desire it , or not . He is intelligent , but only in your service . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do not operate once imprinting occurs . " <p> Crazy . Ridiculous . <p> " How much ? " she heard herself asking . <p> Alfredo followed her home , mute , below the birds and the sky . She could smell him on the evening wind , a clean , strong smell . <p> " Do you speak ? " she asked as he followed her up the steps to her room . <p> Alfredo did not answer for a moment . " Yes . " <p> She asked him no more questions that night . <p> His mind was like a thunderstorm : thick , murky , dark , shot through intermittently by lightning . These were not blasts of intelligence or insight but the brightness of activity , the heat of flesh , the electricity of impulse . He was no more conscious of what happened or what caused his actions than lightning was conscious of the friction between clouds . Occasionally , very occasionally , a light came through him , like the sun through the distant rain , and things stilled within him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She copulated with Alfredo almost continuously the first three days . It was as if a beast had been loosed within her . If she wanted him to stroke her thus , he did so . If she wanted him to bite her there , it was done . Something broke within her and she tried to devour him . <p> It was only when she fully realized she owned him , that he would be there as long as she wanted him , that this abated . Then it was like coming up from underwater , and she looked around her . <p> Alfredo had cost her almost everything she had , nearly all the money she would have used to start a new life . She could not go back to Marc now . Perhaps buying Alfredo had been an act ensuring that . She did n't know . There were jobs on the island for Americans , but they were tricky and illegal to get . <p> At the end of the first day of a waitress job , she came to their room tired and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed staring out the window . It was suddenly too much for her . <p> " You ! I do this to feed you . " She stared at him . He stared back with his dark eyes . <p> " I ca n't go home because of you . " She slapped him . There was no response . <p> She turned away from him and looked out at the sea and the birds . This was n't going to work . <p> Wait . <p> Jean turned to him . " Can you work ? " <p> He ponderously turned his head toward her . " Yes . " <p> " You do speak Spanish ? " <p> " Si . " <p> " Come with me . " <p> She looked through her toilet bag and found a pair of scissors . They were almost too long for what she wanted but they would do . The fluorescent light in the bathroom glittered off the steel as she cut his hair , a sharp , pointed light . After a few moments , she turned his head up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek was smooth against her hand . Impulsively , she kissed him and he moved toward her but she pushed him back down in the chair . " All right , " she said finally . " Take a shower . " He started the water and she watched him for a long minute . After that , she thought , after that , we 'll see . <p> ALFREDO FOUND a job almost immediately and made enough to keep them both alive . Now , Jean lay on the beach and tanned . Alfredo worked hard and his strength was such that he could work through the siesta . He had only to watch a thing done and then could do it . The workers on Isla Mujeres grumbled . jean shrewdly noticed this and sent him across the bay into Cancun where the wages were higher . <p> Two weeks after this they had enough to move into the El Presidente Hotel . <p> That night she looked at him . " Ever the sophisticate , " she murmured . " Go get clothes fit to wear here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Caribe on his arm . He looked so strong and dignified the other women in the room looked at him , then away . jean felt a thrill go through her . Over dinner she murmured instructions which he executed flawlessly . She felt quite fond of him . <p> Over coffee , the waiter brought them a message from a Lydia Conklin and friend , inviting them for cocktails . <p> She read it . Alfredo did not - yet - read and stared away toward the open doorway of the bar . <p> " What are you looking . at ? " she asked . <p> He turned to her . " Nothing . " <p> " Look around the room regularly like a normal person . " <p> He did not answer but instead watched the room as if bored or waiting for the check . <p> Jean read the note again . <p> She shrugged and signed the check . The two of them went to the bar for a drink . <p> " Excuse me . " A woman stood up in front of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked first at her , then at Alfredo . " I 'm Jean Summat . I got your note - " <p> " I was dying for American speech . " As she spoke she only glanced at jean . Her eyes were full of Alfredo . " You do n't know what it 's like . " Now , she turned to Jean . " Or perhaps you do . " <p> " I 've been here a few weeks . " <p> " Senora Summat . " <p> That voice Jean knew . Behind and to her left was Hector . " Good evening , Hector , " <p> " You know Hector too ? " Lydia said idly . " How wonderful . " <p> " Sit with us , Senora . Please . " Hector pulled out a chair for her . Jean looked at Alfredo . Alfredo paused a moment , watched her closely , then sat across from her at the table . <p> Hector sat next to Jean . He leaned toward Lydia . " Senora Summat , Alfredo , and myself were business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lydia raised her eyebrows . <p> " The business is accomplished . It is of no matter . " <p> Jean interrupted . " Are you down for a vacation , Lydia ? " <p> Lydia shrugged . " In a way . I 'm down for my health . This last year I went mad . " <p> Hector laughed . Jean smiled uneasily . Lydia shrugged again . <p> " Senora Conklin makes a good joke . " years ago and fell in love with a Mayan . I 'm back to see if lightning can strike twice . " <p> Something in her face was hard to look at for more than a moment . Jean looked away . " What was the Mayan 's name ? " <p> " Alberto . Hector is helping me find another . " <p> Hector seemed nervous . He turned to Jean . " I introduce Senora Conklin to eligible men - " <p> " He pimps for me . " Lydia lit a cigarette . " Your Mayan reminds me of Alberto . " <p> " Alfredo . His name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face was impassive . <p> " The names are almost the same . " Lydia blew smoke in the air above the table . <p> " Did Alberto care for you ? " <p> " He - " Lydia paused a moment " - he adored me . He was my slave . " <p> " Senoras ? Would you care for more drinks ? " Hector was perspiring now . <p> Jean and Lydia stared at one another . <p> Jean turned to Alfredo . " What do you think of this ? " <p> Alfredo did not speak for a long minute , watching the two women . Then he smiled at Jean . " A Mayan is no woman 's slave . " And he laughed . <p> Lydia stared at him with an open mouth . Hector frowned . <p> Jean looked at them both in triumph . " I suspect that may be the definitive Mayan answer . Alfredo , would you take me to my room ? " <p> Alfredo stood quickly and led her away . <p> Jean was thinking : What is in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and the island was somewhat hotter and much more humid . The frigate birds flew low over the buildings as if the wet air could not support them . The Mexican fishermen brought in great nets of snapper and bonita . The American sport fishermen disappeared in search of marlin and sailfish . <p> Lydia Conklin stayed . She always seemed to be watching Alfredo . Hector seemed to leave the island regularly but he always returned . Jean fancied she could tell when either was around just by the feeling of eyes on Alfredo . <p> Often Lydia would invite them to dinner , or cards , or for drinks . Usually Jean turned her down . Sometimes , though , they would go and Jean never could figure out why . There was a dance here , a dangerous ballet that attracted her . <p> One evening , they were drinking in Lydia 's apartment in the Presidente . " You know , " Lydia began , swirling tequila in a brandy snifter . " I 've been seeing you both for a couple of months now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you do , Alfredo ? " <p> Alfredo sat back in his chair and looked at Jean , then back to Lydia . " Do ? " <p> " How do you support yourself ? " <p> For a moment , Alfredo did not seem to understand . " I do contract work . " <p> Jean glanced at him over the rim of her glass . Good God . What have I got here ? <p> " Contract work ? " Lydia came over to him . " Did you build these great strong arms at a desk job ? " <p> Alfredo shook his head . " I do nothing with a desk . I work with bricklayers . Tilers . Those who build walls and houses . " <p> " Ah ! " Lydia leaned back . " You are a contractor . " <p> " That 's what I said . " <p> " This is how you support her ? This is what she left her husband for ? " Lydia stiffened and swayed , looked down at him . " Christ , you have sunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them Lydia was speaking to . <p> Alfredo looked at Jean and suddenly there was pleading in his eyes . <p> " I think it 's time we left , Lydia . " Jean carefully put down her drink . " Thanks and all . " <p> Lydia threw her glass against the wall shattering it . " I 'm sick of this ! I owned him before you - then , I left him . Hector sold him to me first ! Do you understand ? To me ! " She knelt before him . " Alberto . Tell me you remember me . Tell me I did n't come back for nothing . " <p> Jean could n't move . <p> Alfredo put out his hand and touched her cheek . He traced the line of her jaw , then held her head in both hands . He tilted her face toward his . Her tears were clearly visible now , hot and pouring . He looked at her closely , staring , searching her face with his eyes . <p> " I do n't know you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell at his feet and started sobbing . <p> Alfredo took jeans arm and led her out . " It 's been a lovely evening , " Jean said as they left . <p> Later : in bed . <p> It took her a long time to catch her breath afterward . She was covered in a light sheen of sweat that made her cold in the air conditioning . " What are you ? " she asked quietly . <p> He did not answer . <p> She drew the tip of her finger down his chest . " Answer me . What are you ? " <p> He looked at her in the dark and she could see a glow in his eyes . " I do n't know . " <p> YOU COULD NOT call it consciousness , for consciousness determines its own needs and he could not do that . He was predetermined . He was programmed . Neither could you call him a person , for a person has a complex assortment of drives that come from many sources . His drives were simple and their source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , willful , resourceful . A tool aimed at a specific purpose . <p> Jean followed him to Cancun . <p> She sat in the far back section of the crowded ferry , away from him . There had been a storm the day before and though the air was clear , the resulting seas kept the big automobile ferry at dock . But the little ferry that carried only people plowed through the sea . It was close and hot aboard the boat and it stank of animals , sweat , rotten fish , diesel fumes . The sea pitched them back and forth until Jean was sure she was about to be sick . A large rip in the fabric covering the deck rails showed the bobbing horizon and she stared at it until she had the nausea under control . <p> Alfredo did not seem to notice . He sat on one of the benches leaning on his elbows . <p> When the boat docked he hailed one of the cabs and left . Jean was barely able to hail one in time to follow him . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the site of a new library . Alfredo stepped out of the cab and Jean did n't recognize him at first . He 'd changed in the cab . His workman 's dungarees and loose shirt were gone . Now , he was wearing a tie and short-sleeved white shirt and slacks . He walked over to the contractor 's office , never noticing her following him . She saw him talking with the architect in rapid-fire Spanish . He seemed to be in charge of the construction . She withdrew before he could see her . <p> As Jean left the construction site she saw a woman sitting on the park bench across the street from the office . The woman smoked a cigarette and watched Alfredo through the office window . It was Lydia Conklin . <p> Jean moved into the shade behind her to watch . <p> After an hour or so , Alfredo came out with a soda and sat down with the foreman to discuss some detail of the construction . Lydia put out the cigarette and crossed the street to him . He stood to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Lydia raked his face with her nails - Jean could see the blood - and left him , walking hurriedly . <p> Jean left hurriedly , too . She had no desire to see Lydia . Jean returned to the ferry and stood on the open deck this time , smiling , watching nothing but the open sea and the frigate birds flying in the wind . <p> She checked her bank account in Isla Mujeres . There were several thousand dollars more than there should have been . Alfredo must have been in this position for some time . It made her laugh softly . <p> He is mine , Lydia . He is mine to touch , make , and mold . <p> The storm in him gradually calmed . The needs that drove him called out other needs , other traits . A sluggish thought blew through him , an inarticulate gale across the continents of what should have been a mind . It shook him . It broke the back of the incoherent storm that raged in him and let in the light . He stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Jean awoke and he was not there . <p> She sat up suddenly and looked around the room . He stood , nude , on the balcony staring at the sea . The sliding door was open . She could smell the ocean through the air conditioning . <p> " Alfredo ? " <p> He croaked something unintelligible . <p> She followed him out into the air . " Alfredo ? " He was dripping with sweat . The moonlight made him glow . " Did you have a nightmare ? " Ridiculous . Why would he have nightmares ? <p> He turned to her and his face was wet with tears , the long scabs from Lydia 's fingernails dark on his silver face . He shook his head , buried his face in his hands . <p> " What 's going on ? " She started toward him . <p> He looked at her in such pain she stepped back . " I am ..... " Suddenly , Jean did not want to know . She left him and reentered the apartment . Alfredo followed her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was huge . He filled the room - she remembered the night in Hector 's house , how strong he was . He was dark in the shadows of the room , looming over her . <p> " I am ... , " he repeated . " I am a man . " He reached for her again . <p> Jean dodged him and ran to the other edge of the table . " Stay there . " <p> " Jean ... I have become a man for you . " <p> " Stay there ! That 's an order ! " <p> He followed her . They circled the table . Jean grabbed the scissors from the table and held them in front of her . " Stay away from me . " <p> " Jean . I love you . " <p> The moonlight struck his face and it was all shadows and silver . His eyes glowed for her , his face was transfigured by some secret knowledge . He leaped the table toward her and she fell back and he took her shoulders . She screamed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands fell away from her and she stumbled against the wall , staring at him . <p> Alfredo touched the handles of the scissors , looked at her and began to sway , caught himself , fell down to his knees . He looked at her again and full realization of what had happened seemed to touch him . He fell on his back , twitched twice , and was still . <p> Jean crumpled into a chair and watched the body . Finally , she pulled the scissors from his chest and washed them in the bathroom until they were clean . She drew her finger down the blades . Not sharp . Not sharp at all . But sharp enough . She smiled . She felt filled somehow . Satisfied . <p> Jean packed carefully and when she was done , she kissed Alfredo good-bye on his cold lips and walked down to the ferry dock . She reached the Cancun airport in time for the early morning flight to New Orleans . From there , she took a flight to Boston . <p> As she lay back in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought about Marc : if he had waited for her , if he had divorced her . She would like to start again with him if she could , but she would survive if she could n't . She felt alive with possibility . <p> Jean fell asleep and dreamed of frigate birds circling endlessly above her . <p> Hector found him an hour after dawn . " Mierda , " he said when he saw the blood . " That she could ...... He shook his head as he opened the suitcase he had with him . With tools he had brought with him , he cut open Alfredo 's chest and sewed the heart and lungs back together , then closed the chest cavity . From the suitcase he brought two broad plates connected to thick electrical cables and attached them to either side of Alfredo 's chest . Alfredo convulsed as Hector adjusted the controls inside the suitcase . Alfredo moaned and opened his eyes . <p> " Good , " said Hector . He detached the plates and returned them to the suitcase . <p> " Hector @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She hurt me . " <p> Hector watched him carefully but did not listen . He flicked two switches and watched the meters . <p> Alfredo sat up . " I am a man , Hector . " <p> Hector nodded absently and adjusted his controls . " Certainly , she thought you were . Or she would never have tried to kill you . Stand , por favor . " <p> Alfredo stood . " I am still a man . " <p> Hector shrugged . " For the moment . " <p> " You ca n't take something like that away . " Alfredo clutched his hands together and looked out the window . " I must follow her . " <p> " She does n't want you . She 's gotten what she needed . " <p> Alfredo turned and noticed the suitcase . He watched Hector adjusting the controls . Alfredo pleaded with him . " I love her . She needs me . You ca n't take something like that away . " <p> " No ? " Two needles appeared on either side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " Hector ! Do n't . Please . " Alfredo 's hands clutched the air and his face twisted . " Please , " he whispered . " You ca n't - " <p> Hector flicked a switch and Alfredo stiffened . A blank look descended on Alfredo 's face . <p> " Of course I can , " said Hector and stood up himself . " Senora Conklin ? He is ready . " <p> Lydia entered the room . " He is ? Wonderful . " She turned to the Mayan . " Alberto . " The blank eyes turned toward the sound of her voice . " I am so glad to see you again . " <p> Author Affiliation
