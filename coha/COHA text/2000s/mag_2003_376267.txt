The citizens of Xiaoli Village move lazily , with a languor born of chronic underemployment . They are farmers by tradition , but exorbitant taxes have leached any profitability out of their profession . So on most hot days , the local peasants sit on concrete stoops , pant legs hiked up to their thighs , fanning themselves with the latest propaganda broadsheet from Beijing and waiting for dusk to fall . For it is only at night that Xiaoli comes alive . <P> Underneath this sad little village in Henan province is the rich legacy of five millenniums of Chinese history . The nearby city of Luoyang was the capital of at least nine dynasties , and the fields of today 's peasants are littered with imperial tombs . Many still hold impossibly valuable works of art buried centuries ago . Breaking into these tombs and stealing the national treasures they hold are illegal , of course . But the lure is too great for many , especially because one major haul , sold to a smuggler , can equal a year 's farming income . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the bar , " says Little Su , a Xiaoli doctor who put himself through medical school with the spoils of treasure hunts beneath the fields around his home . " If you 're bored one night , someone will say , ' Hey , let 's go find a tomb . ' " The rewards of these amateur and often dangerous nocturnal expeditions are evident in Little Su 's wardrobe  --  he has long since traded in baggy peasant garb for snazzy Playboy shirts and gleaming loafers  --  and in the incongruous mishmash of mud-brick shacks and shiny white-tiled houses with satellite dishes lining the streets of Xiaoli . " You can tell who raided the best tombs just by looking at their houses , " says Little Su . The richest citizens even have big-screen TVs and video-game machines . Little Su 's favorite game ? Tomb Raider . <P> Archaeologists like to joke that the pillaging of temples and other ancient sites is the world 's second oldest profession . But what used to be a trickle of plundered treasures has become a flood in recent years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in converting an untapped resource into a few modern consumer appliances , are merely the first link in a global antiquities-smuggling chain that the U.N . says rivals the drug and arms trades in scope and scale . Says Kathryn Tubb , conservator of the Institute of Archaeology at University College of London : " It 's commonly accepted by those of us who work in the field that 80% to 90% of the material on the market is illicit . " <P> The trade in Asian relics  --  whether obtained legally or looted  --  is booming , driven by demand from wealthy Western and Eastern collectors seeking to decorate their SoHo lofts and Shanghai penthouses with everything from ancient Buddha heads to Khmer sculptures . During art auctions in London this summer , two of the brightest sales were of prized Asian objects , both of them legitimately acquired : a Chinese Qianlong-era jade vase from a private collection that went for $280,000 at Bonham 's and a calligraphy-brush washer from the Southern Song dynasty that sold for an astounding $1.2 million at Sotheby's.       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
