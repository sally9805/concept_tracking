ST . JOHN CORBEIL A beautiful fall night in Glen Burnie , a Thursday , autumn leaves kicking along the streets . A bicycle with a flickering headlamp , a dog running alongside , a sense of quiet . A good night for a cashmere sportcoat or small black pearls at an intimate restaurant down in the District ; maybe white Notre Damestyle tapers and a rich controversial senator eating trout with a pretty woman not his wife . Like that . Terrence Lighter would have none of it . Not tonight , anyway . Tonight , he was on his own , walking back from a bookstore with a copy of SmartMoney in his hand and a pornographic videotape in his jacket pocket . He whistled as he walked . His wife , April , was back in Michigan visiting her mother , and he had a twelve-pack of beer in the refrigerator and a bag of blue-corn nachos on the kitchen counter . And the tape . The way he saw it was this : he 'd get back to the house , pop a beer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little time with himself , and then switch over to Thursday Night Football . At halftime , he 'd call April about the garden fertilizer . He could never remember the numbers , 12-6-4 or 6-2-3 or whatever . Then he 'd catch the second half of the game , and after the final gun , he 'd be ready for the tape again . An unhappy thought crossed his mind . Dallas : What they hell were they doing out in Dallas , with those recon photos ? Where 'd they dig those up ? How 'd that geek get his hands on them ? Something to be settled next week . He had n't heard back from Dallas , and ifhe had n't heard by Monday afternoon , he 'd memo the deputy director just to cover his ass . That was for next week . Tonight he had the tape , the beer , and the nachos . Not a bad night for a fifty-three-year-old , high-ranking bureaucrat with a sexually distant wife . Not bad at all ... Lighter was a block and a half from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside a darkened house . He was dressed all in black , and Lighter did n't see him until the last minute . The man said nothing at all , but his arm was swinging up . Lighter 's last living thought was a question . " Gun ? " A silenced 9mm . The man fired once into Lighter 's head and the impact twisted the bureaucrat to his right . He took one dead step onto the grass swale and was down . The man fired another shot into the back of the dead man 's skull , then felt beneath his coat for a wallet . Found it . Felt the videotape and took that , too . He left the body where it had fallen and ran , athletically , lightly , across the lawn , past the lilac , to the back lot line , and along the edge of a flower garden to the street . He ran a hundred fifty yards , quiet in his running shoes , invisible in his black jogging suit . He 'd worked out the route during the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second man was waiting in the car on a quiet corner . The shooter ran up to the corner , slowed , then walked around it . If anyone had been coming up the street , they would n't have seen him running ... As they rolled away , the second man asked , " Everything all right ? " " Went perfect . " The shooter dug through the dead man 's wallet . " We even got four hundred bucks and a fuck flick . " They were out again the next night . This time , the target was an aging ' driveway in front of the house . Lights shone from a back window , and a lamp with a yellow shade was visible through a crack in the drapes of the big front window . The thin odor of bratwurst was in the aira backyard barbecue , maybe , at a house further down the block . Kids were playing in the streets , a block or two over , their screams and shouts small and contained by the distance , like static on an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as dry as shredded wheat and stepped up on the concrete slab that served as a porch . The taller of the two touched the pistol that hung from his shoulder holster . He tried the front door : locked . He looked at the shorter man , who shrugged , leaned forward , and pushed the doorbell. * * * John James Morrison was the same age as the men outside his door , but thinner , taller , without the easy coordination ; a gawky , bespectacled Ichabod Crane with a fine white smile and a strange ability to draw affection from women . He lived on cinnamon-flavored candies called Hot Tamales and Diet Coke , with pepperoni pizza for protein . He sometimes shook with the rush of sugar and caffeine , and he liked it . The men outside his door stressed exercise and drug therapy , mixed Creatine with androstenedione and Vitamins E , C , B , and A. The closest Morrison got to exercise was a habitual one-footed twirl in his thousand-dollar Herman Miller Aeron office chair , which he took with him on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through a shambles of perforated wide-carriage printer paper and Diet Coke cans in the smaller of the rambler 's two bedrooms . A rancid , three-day-old Domino 's box , stinking of pepperoni and soured cheese , was jammed into an overflowing trash can next to the desk . He 'd do something about the trash later . Right now , he did n't have the time . Morrison peered into the flat blue-white glow of the computer screen , struggling with the numbers , checking and rechecking code . An Optimus transportable stereo sat on the floor in the corner , with a stack of CDs on top of the right speaker . Morrison pushed himself out of his chair and bent over the CDs , looked for something he would n't have to think about . He came up with a Harry Connick Jr . disk , and dropped it in the changer . Love Is Here to Stay burbled from the speakers and Morrison took a turn around in the chair . Did a little dance step . Maybe another hit of caffeine ... * * * The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no good friends in Dallas , nobody to come calling late . He took another two steps , to the office door , and looked sideways across the front room , through a crack in the front drapes . He could see the front porch . One or two men , their bulk visible in the lamplight . He could n't see their faces , but he recognized the bulk . " Oh , shit . " He stepped back into the office , clicked on a computer file , and dragged it to a box labeled Shredder . He clicked Shred , waited until the confirmation box came up , clicked Yes , I 'm sure . The shredder was set to the highest level : if the file was completely shredded , it could n't be recovered . But that would take time ... He had to make some . He killed the monitors , but let the computer run . He picked up his laptop , turned off the lights in the office , and pulled the door most of the way closed , leaving a crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room was dark . Maybe they would n't go in right away , and the shredder would have more time to grind . The laptop he carried into the kitchen , turning it on as he walked . He propped it open on the kitchen counter , and pulled a stool in front of it . The doorbell rang again and he hurried out the door and called , " Just a minute . " He looked back in the computer room , just a glance , and could see the light blinking on the hard drive . He was shredding only one gigabyte of the twenty that he had . Still , it would take time ... He was out of it . The man outside was pounding on the door . He headed back through the house , snapped on the living room overhead lights to let them know he was coming , looked out through the drapesanother ten seconds goneand unlocked the front door . " Had to get my pants on , " he said to the two men on the stoop . " What 's up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , up a freight elevator , through a heavily alarmed lock-out room at the top , and into the main security area . Corbeil was waiting . St. John Corbeil was a hard man ; in his early forties , his square-cut face seamed with stress and sun and wind . His blue eyes were small , intelligent , and deeply set beneath his brow ridge ; his nose and lips narrow , hawklike . He wore a tight , military haircut , with just a hint of a fifties flattop . " Mr. Morrison , " he said . " I have a tape I want you to listen to . " Morrison was nervous , but not yet frightened . There 'd been a couple of threats back at the house , but not of violence . If he did n't come with them , they 'd said , he would be dismissed on the spot , and AmMath would sue him for violating company security policies , industrial espionage , and theft of trade secrets . He would n't work for a serious company again , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and sued him , nobody would hire him again . Trust was all-important , when a company gave a man root in its computer system . When you were that deep in the computers , everything was laid bare , Everything . On the other hand , if he could talk with them , maybe he could deal . He might lose this job , but they would n't be suing him . They would n't go public . So he went with them . He and the escort drove in his car " So we do n't have to drag your ass all the way back here , " the security guy saidwhile the second security agent said he 'd be following . He had n't yet shown up . So Morrison stood , nervously , shoulders slumped , like a peasant dragged before the king , as Corbeil pushed an audiotape into a tape recorder . He recognized the voice : Terrence Lighter . " John , what the hell are you guys doing out there ? This geek shows up on my doorstep ... " Shit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . " I came across what I thought was anomalous worknothing to do with Clipper , but it was obviously top secret and the way it was being handled ... it should n't have been handled that way , " Morrison told Corbeil . He was standing like a petitioner , while Corbeil sat in a terminal chair . " When I was working at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , I was told that if I ever found an anomaly like that , I should report it at least two levels up , so that it could n't be hidden and so that security problems could be fixed . " " So you went to Lighter ? " " I did n't think I had a choice . And you should remember that I did talk to Lighter , " Morrison said . " Now , I think , we should give the FBI a ring . See what they say . " " You silly cunt . " Corbeil slipped a cell phone from a suit pocket , punched a button , waited a few seconds , then asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Okay . Drop the disks . We 're gon na go ahead on this end . " Corbeil 's security agent , who 'd been waiting patiently near the door , looked at his watch and said , " If we 're gon na do it , we better get it done . Goodie 's gon na be starting up here in the next fifteen minutes and I got ta run around the building and get in place . " Corbeil gave Morrison a long look , and Morrison said , " What ? " Corbeil shook his head , got up , stepped over to the security agent , and said , " Let me . " The agent slipped out his .40 Smith and handed it to Corbeil , who turned and pointed it at Morrison . " You better tell us what you did with the data or you 're gon na get your ass hurt real bad , " he said quietly . " Do n't point the gun at me ; do n't point the gun ... " Morrison said . Corbeil could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked this part . He 'd shot the Iraqi colonels and a few other ragheads and deer and antelope and elk and javelina and moose and three kinds of bear and groundhogs and prairie dogs and more birds than he could count ; and it all felt pretty good . He shot Morrison twice in the chest . Morrison did n't gape in surprise , stagger , slap a hand to his wounds , or open his eyes wide in amazement . He simply fell down . " Christ , my ears are ringing , " Corbeil said to the security agent . He did n't mention the sudden erection . " Was n't much , " he said . " Nothing like Iraq . " But his hand was trembling when he passed over the gun . The agent had seen it before , hunting on the ranch . " Let 's get the other shot done , " the agent said . " Yes . " They got the .38 from a desk drawer , wrapped Morrison 's dead hand around it , and fired it once into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Corbeil said . " I 'll dump the newspapers . " " I 'll be to Goodie 's right . That 's your left , " the agent said . " I know that , " Corbeil said impatiently . " Well , Jesus , do n't forget it , " the agent said . " I wo n't forget it , " Corbeil snapped . " Sorry . But remember . Remember . I 'll be to your left . And you got ta reload now , and take the used shell with you ... " " I 'll remember it all , William . This is my life as much as it is yours . " Okay . " The agent 's eyes drifted toward the crumbled form of Morrison . " What a schmuck . " " We had no choice ; it was a million-to-one that he 'd find that stuff , " Corbeil said . He glanced at his watch : " You better move . " Larry Goodie hitched up his gun belt , sighed , and headed for the elevators . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and he turned to see William Hart checking through with his key card . " Asshole , " Goodie said to himself . He continued toward the elevators , but slower now . Only one elevator ran at night , and Hart would probably want a ride to the top . As Hart came through , Goodie pushed the elevator button and found a smile for the security man . " How 's it going , Larry ? " Hart asked . " Slow night , " Goodie said . " That 's how it 's supposed to be , is n't it ? " Hart asked . " S'pose , " Goodie said . " When was the last time you had a fast night ? " Goodie knew he was being hazed and he did n't like it . The guys from TrendDirect were fine . The people with AmMath , the people from " Upstairs , " were assholes . " Most of ' em are a little slow , " he admitted . " Had some trouble with the card reader that one time , everybody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tenth floor and they both got off . Goodie turned left , and Hart turned right , toward his office . Then Hart touched Goodie 's sleeve and said , " Larry , was that lock like that ? " Goodie followed Hart 's gaze : something wrong with the lock on Gerald R. Kind 's office . He stepped closer , and looked . Somebody had used a pry-bar on the door . " No , I do n't believe it was . I was up here an hour ago , " Goodie said . He turned and looked down the hall . The lights in the security area were out . The security area was normally lit twenty-four hours a day . " We better check , " Hart said , dropping his voice . Hart eased open the office door , and Goodie saw that another door , on the other side , stood open . " Quiet , " Hart whispered . He led the way through the door , and out the other side , into a corridor that led to the secure area . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the secure area beyond it was dark . " Look at that screen , " Hart whispered , as they slipped down the hall . A computer screen had a peculiar glow to it , as if it had just been shut down . " I think there 's somebody in there . " " I 'll get the lights , " Goodie whispered back . His heart was thumping ; nothing like this had ever happened . " Better arm yourself , " Hart said . Hart slipped an automatic pistol out of a belt holster , and Goodie gulped and fumbled out his own revolver . He 'd never actually drawn it before . " Ready ? " Hart asked . " Maybe we ought to call the cops , " Goodie whispered . " Just get the lights , " Hart whispered . He barely breathed the words at the other man . " Just reach through , the switch is right inside . " Goodie got to the door frame , reached inside with one hand , and somebody screamed at him : " NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a face , and then WHAM ! The flash blinded him and he felt as though he 'd been hit in the ribs with a ball bat . He went down backwards , and saw the flashes from Hart 's weapon straight over his head , WHAM WHAM WHAM WHAM ... Goodie did n't count the shots , but his whole world seemed to consist of noise ; then the back of his head hit the carpet and his mouth opened and he groaned , and his body was on fire . He lay there , not stirring , until Hart 's face appeared in his line of vision : " Hold on , Larry , goddamnit , hold on , I 'm calling an ambulance ... Hold on ... "
