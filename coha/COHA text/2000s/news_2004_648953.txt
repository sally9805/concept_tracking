<p> On the eve of the return of the Olympics to the country that gave birth to them , the flame burned brightly from the illuminated Parthenon on Thursday night , but Athens was on the verge of being host to star-crossed Games . <p> Greece has endured the burdens of construction delays , security concerns and cost overruns , sending the price tag for the 2004 Summer Games soaring past $7 billion . <p> Then late Thursday , the Greek team was rattled when two of its top sprinters were injured in a motorcycle accident , hours after they missed scheduled drug tests at the Olympic Village . <p> The sprinters , Konstantinos Kenteris , Greece 's top hope for a gold medal and the leading candidate to be the final torchbearer in Friday night 's opening ceremony , and his training partner Katerina Thanou , the nation 's top female sprinter , could be barred from the Games . Kenteris is the defending Olympic champion in the 200 meters and Thanou is the defending silver medalist in the 100 meters . <p> Tassos Papachristou , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the motorcycle accident involving Kenteris and Thanou . He said it occurred between 10 and 11 p.m . Thursday but declined to provide specifics . <p> " We do n't know exactly what the problems are , " he said , referring to the athletes ' injuries . " They stay in the hospital at least one night . Kenteris is more serious . " <p> The news about Thanou and Kenteris , the most celebrated athlete in the largest Olympic delegation ever from Greece , followed an unsettling few days for the host team . <p> On Saturday , a Greek judo team member jumped from a balcony in an apparent suicide attempt that left her unconscious in a hospital . Her boyfriend jumped from the same balcony two days later . <p> Two Greek-American baseball players , recruited to bolster the home team , were barred for taking prohibited substances and replaced . <p> But the exclusion of Kenteris , a national hero since he became the first Greek track and field athlete to win an Olympic gold medal in a running event since 1896 , would be far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Thanou , 29 , were supposed to appear Friday morning at a hearing with the International Olympic Committee 's disciplinary panel to determine their eligibility to compete . <p> A missed test is treated as a failed test , and after two missed tests , I.O.C. rules call for immediate suspension from competition . <p> The 11th-hour drama seemed appropriate for Athens , which nearly lost the right to be host to the Olympics less than four years ago because of construction delays . <p> These Games are beginning under the dual clouds of concern regarding security and doping . <p> Track and field , the premier sport of the Summer Games , was rocked by the Balco steroids investigation , which began in the United States in the spring . <p> Kenteris has been Greece 's most popular athlete , featured on billboards and commercials , but he remains a mystery . <p> He has competed sparingly , winning the 200 at the world championships in 2001 and at the European championships in 2002 . But he pulled out of the 2003 world championships because of a thigh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been nursing injuries , competed for the first time this year at the Greek track and field trials in June . He ran the 100 , but was selected for the 200 . <p> Kenteris missed a drug test last March while training in Qatar rather than in Crete , where he said he would be . His coach was given a warning . <p> Athletes must provide their whereabouts to their sport 's federation and , at the Olympic Games , to the International Olympic Committee . <p> Greek reports that the locations of Kenteris and Thanou were unknown for the previous three days prompted numerous questions at an unrelated news conference with the World Anti-Doping Agency . <p> " I 'm not sure where he is or what efforts have been made to find him , " Dick Pound , the chairman of the agency , said of Kenteris on Thursday morning . <p> " If he 's picked by whoever it is to be tested , he 's obliged to provide notice of where he is , " Pound said . " So we should be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the I.O.C. , together with officials from the anti-doping agency , could not find Kenteris and Thanou . Papachristou said Kenteris and Thanou had checked into the Olympic Village on Thursday . <p> But according to a statement released by the Greek Olympic committee , at 6:15 p.m . Thursday the I.O.C. doping control representative went to the office of the leader of the Greek team , John Papadogiannakis , and said he was " looking for Kenteris and Thanou in order to proceed to sample collections , as requested by the I.O.C. , but he did not find the athletes in their rooms . " <p> Papadogiannakis also searched for the athletes and contacted their coach , who was notified of the doping tests . The coach told Papadogiannakis that they had left the Olympic Village to return to their homes to pick up personal belongings . <p> " They did not show up , " Papachristou said . <p> " The authorities waited for one hour and a half , and they closed their case as a nonshow . " <p> Papachristou added that both Kenteris and Thanou had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be tested Friday , but that the I.O.C. had no response . <p> The I.O.C. issued a statement on its Web site saying that the " alleged anti-doping rule violation committed by two Greek athletes " was their " unavailability for testing and failing , without compelling justification , to submit to sample collection after testing notification . " <p> According to the I.O.C. doping rules that govern the period of July 30 through Aug. 29 , any athlete who is unavailable for two tests will have committed a doping violation . <p> The fact that the I.O.C. disciplinary commission is hearing the cases of Kenteris and Thanou would suggest that they had missed a previous test . <p> The I.O.C. will conduct 2,600 tests from the top four finishers and two random athletes in each event , as well as 400 out-of-competition tests . <p> On Thursday morning , Pound said he was confident that the new testing technology would dissuade or catch cheaters , and he confirmed that there would be a test at these Games for human growth hormone . <p> " For us , every positive test @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of success , " Pound said . " It means that one or more cheaters are taken out of this competition . What I hope is that the ones that sneak by their domestic testing will get caught here . " <p> Pound criticized the leadership of USA Track and Field , which he said has lacked an attitude of " no tolerance for cheating " and is not yet credible . <p> " I think the leadership within USA Track and Field has been largely responsible for this problem getting as bad as it has , " Pound said . " I think they are going to have to look very carefully at their own house . " <p> By the end of the evening , the United States team 's house was not the only one in doubt . <p> " It 's just very , very unfortunate that we end up in this manner , that this is taking away from the athletes in that particular sport and more so the Games , " said Herman Frazier , the United States delegation chief . " This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talking about the athletes that are here , rather than all of these other issues .
