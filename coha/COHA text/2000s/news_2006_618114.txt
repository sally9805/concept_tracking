<p> In April , Gwinnett Commissioner Kevin Kenerly got a voice mail message about his upcoming re-election campaign . <p> " I 'm coming " after you , the caller said . " Get ready for the fight of your life . " <p> Now , Kenerly is the subject of an anonymous campaign to defeat him , one that is operating outside Georgia campaign laws and raising concerns in Gwinnett political circles . <p> Kenerly suspects polictical consultant Bill McKinney , the man who left the voice mail in April . " Everything leads to him , " Kenerly said . <p> But while McKinney admits making the call and trying to defeat Kenerly , he says he 's not behind the anonymous campaign . " I had nothing to do with any bulk anonymous mailings , " McKinney said . <p> The campaign began when someone hired a private investigator to videotape Kenerly on a March trip to Las Vegas . Then , DVDs of the video , which show Kenerly gambling and dining with Gwinnett developers , were sent anonymously to local media outlets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own way on the trip . He said he takes a similar trip with family and friends every year . <p> " They have been looking at me for six months and all they can come up with is , ' Let 's follow Kevin Kenerly to Vegas , ' " Kenerly said . <p> The anonymous mailer , using the name beatkevin.com , followed the DVD with two additional attack mailers . One compares the three-term commissioner to convicted tax evader and former Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell . <p> The mailings appear to be illegal under state elections laws because they are clearly political but no campaign committee is identified and no candidate has taken credit for the expenditures . <p> The Web site was registered June 26 using McKinney 's cellphone number and e-mail address , according to register.com 's Web site database . McKinney 's name does not appear on the registration . <p> McKinney denies involvement , saying someone else used his contact information . <p> " This is a political dirty trick . I never registered that name , " said McKinney , who has consulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidates and is the legislative aide to Rep. John Heard ( R-Lawrenceville . ) <p> The information listed on the Web site registration was changed shortly after the AJC Gwinnett News began asking questions about it on June 27 . A woman who answered a new phone number listed for the Web site twice said the newspaper had a wrong number and refused to talk further . <p> All three of Kenerly 's challengers have denied involvement with beatkevin.com . He faces financial adviser Butch Poss and real estate lawyer Jodie Rosser in the Republican primary on Tuesday . The winner will face Democrat John Kenney , who owns a technology company , in the November election . <p> The Web site beatkevin.com says it is run by a group of " businessmen , lawyers , Gwinnett County employees and politically minded citizens " who fear retaliation from Kenerly . The message was posted late this week after the site stayed blank for days , showing only a message the site was " under construction . " <p> Political consultants , business leaders and voters have been angered by the mailings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry their candidates could be next to face an underground campaign . Residents say they have no idea how to judge the credibility of the information . Local leaders say the anonymous attacks against a sitting commissioner are n't good for business in Gwinnett . <p> Even Bob Griggs , a community activist who has opposed Kenerly for years , denounced the anonymous attacks on his Web site devoted to slamming Kenerly . In the days after beatkevin.com was registered , the site linked to Griggs ' Web site without his permission . Like Kenerly , Griggs suspects McKinney , going so far as to detail his reasons why on a local political blog . <p> Former Gwinnett GOP chairman Buzz Brockway also has blogged about the attacks . " In my opinion , if an anonymous effort to discredit or defeat a candidate is allowed to stand without any repercussions , politics in Gwinnett will be seriously harmed , " Brockway told AJC Gwinnett News . <p> McKinney , who has sent e-mails to Griggs and Brockway denying any involvement in the mailings , has a long history in Gwinnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former Gwinnett Commissioner John Dunn , Gwinnett Commission Chairman Charles Bannister and various state legislative candidates . McKinney and Bannister are close personal friends and were business partners for 30 years . <p> McKinney caused a stir in 2004 when he dropped Bannister 's name during a couple of meetings with county officials after Bannister won the GOP primary for chairman and was on his way to a landslide win in the general election . County officials wrote memos saying they felt McKinney was attempting to use his friendship with Bannister to twist their arms over a fire department hiring and a development pro-ject . McKinney denied he bullied the officials . <p> McKinney has acknowledged leaving the phone message for Kenerly in April , saying he was angry because he believes Kenerly talked a challenger into running against Heard in his re-election this year . Kenerly , who denies he had anything to do with the challenge to Heard , provided a recording of McKinney 's call to AJC Gwinnett News . <p> The two men have n't always been at odds . In January , Kenerly paid McKinney $2,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't report the check , written from a business account , on a state-required campaign contribution disclosure in March . Kenerly rushed to county election headquarters late last month to report the expenditure after McKinney sent a copy to AJC Gwinnett News and the newspaper began asking questions . Kenerly said his failure to report the check initially was an oversight . <p> In his voice mail to Kenerly in April , McKinney said he was going to volunteer for Rosser 's campaign . Rosser has said McKinney is not working with her campaign . <p> The beatkevin.com mailers containing the Kenerly casino DVDs were printed with a return address of P.O. Box 3172 , Cumming , the same address listed on the Web site registration . The U.S. Postal Service has turned down requests by AJC Gwinnett News for contact information on the holder of P.O. Box 3172 . <p> But two political consultants say postal workers have confirmed someone dropped off 9,000 pieces of mail on June 26 addressed from beatkevin.com. under bulk mail permit 1402 . That same day , beatkevin.com was registered . Voters in District @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mail that week with the same bulk mail permit number . <p> The consultants  --  Marc Rountree and Todd Rhem  --  say the mail was dropped off at the Boggs Road bulk mail distribution center in Gwinnett under permit 1402 . Rountree works for Kenerly . Rhem works for Lawrenceville City Councilman David Rodriguez , who is running against Rep. Heard , McKinney 's boss and close friend . <p> Postal workers told Rhem and a Rountree associate that a bulk mail log from June 26 shows the mailer was dropped off by Grayson-based ABC Direct Marketing and signed for by the company 's president of sales , Chris Cawthon . Cawthon did not return repeated phone calls seeking comment . The postal service has so far declined to provide the bulk-mail log or the permit holder 's contact information . <p> Kenerly said he believes the anonymous mailings will backfire because voters do n't like underhanded tactics or anonymous attackers . <p> " They do n't want to put their names on it because they know it 's wrong , " Kenerly said . " When people hide behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believe what they 're saying . " <p> CORRECTION-DATE : July 18 , 2006 <p> CORRECTION : <p> Political consultant Todd Rehm 's name was misspelled in a story in Monday 's AJC Gwinnett News about the Gwinnett District 4 commission race .
