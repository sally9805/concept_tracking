Chapter One One Year Later Palm Springs Monday Like much of the town , the law offices of Morton Hingham were left over from a more leisurely , luxuriant time . Second-story arched windows framed a view of low-roofed buildings , tall palm trees , and stony mountains that dwarfed everything human . Inside the reception area , creamy walls and rich green plants soothed the eye . Solid wood furniture gleamed with polish . The carpet was worn , but tastefully so , like a dowager princess . The secretary-receptionist was the same . Her voice was crepe , irregular without being rough . " Ms. Charters ? Mr. Hingham will see you now . " For a moment Serena stared blankly at the receptionist . In this cool , gracious room with its stately aura of law and civilization , it was hard for her to remember that her grandmother had died from a random act of violence of the kind more often associated with inner cities than with the desert 's ageless wilderness . Very few animals killed simply because they could . Homo sapiens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serena said in a husky voice . The older woman nodded , ushered the client into Morton Hingham 's office , and shut the door behind her . A quick glance told Serena that the lawyer 's office had shuttered windows and no visible wallpaper . Every vertical surface was concealed by books whose covers were as dull and dry as their titles . Various legal documents lay stacked haphazardly on Hingham 's heavy desk . An array of computers along the far wall looked out of place amid all the leatherboundmonuments to past decisions , writs , and opinions . Hingham 's swivel chair creaked and jerked when he stood to greet his client . Long past the age when other men retired , the lawyer kept his shrewd mind engaged with the trials and tangles of people generations younger than he was . " Sorry to keep you waiting , Ms. Charters , " Hingham said , clearing his throat . " There is a particularly difficult custody case that ... " He cleared his throat again . " I understand , " Serena said , a polite lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had been quite willing to look out the windows at the mountains that had ringed her childhood and formed her adult dreams . " I take it that the State of California is ready to close the books on my grandmother 's murder ? " " The books will never be closed until her killer is found . But , yes . I 'm empowered as her executor to turn over to you all that remains of Lisbeth Charters 's er , your grandmother 's worldly goods . " His use of her grandmother 's real name Lisbeth Charters told Serena that her grandmother had trusted this man as she had trusted only one other person on earth : her granddaughter . Then the rest of the sentence penetrated Serena 's mind . She compressed her lips against bitter laughter . Worldly goods . Her grandmother had lived a simple , spartan life . Her reward had been a cruel , savage death . " I see , " Serena said neutrally . " Does the fact that I 'm finally receiving my so-called inheritance mean that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The controlled anger beneath his client 's voice made Hingham examine her more carefully . Middle height , casually dressed in blue jeans and an unusual woven jacket , a slender yet female body that once would have aroused him and even now interested him , red-gold hair in a long French braid down her back , triangular face with eyes as cool and measuring as a cat 's . The papers in his hand told him that she was in her early thirties . Her face looked younger , though her oddly colored eyes held an unflinching power that belonged to an empress twice her age . Lisbeth Serena Charters had had eyes like that . Violet blue . Wide-set . Fascinating . Unnerving . Hingham cleared his throat again . " You were never under serious suspicion , Ms. Charters . As the detective explained , it was simply routine to ascertain your whereabouts the night your grandmother died , especially as you were her sole surviving heir . " " The detective explained . It did n't change how I felt . " " Yes , well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It still is . Even though G'mom and I were n't close , she was the only family I had . " And every day , Serena asked herself if she and her grandmother had been closer , would her grandmother still be alive ? There was no answer . There never would be . Abruptly her hand moved in an impatient gesture . " Let 's get this over with . I have work to do . " " Work ? " Hingham glanced at the papers in his hand . " I understood that you were self-employed . " " Exactly . No time off for good behavior . My employer is a bitch . " A ghostly smile rearranged the wrinkles on the lawyer 's face . " Would she mind if you took time for coffee ? " Serena smiled despite her unhappiness with the law , the legal profession , and the bureaucracy of the State of California . " Thanks , but I really should get back to Leucadia before the freeways turn into parking lots . " " Then if you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves , Serena went to the wing chair that waited beside Hingham 's desk . Outwardly calm , she forced herself to sit quietly . She had spent a lot of her life masking the energy and intelligence that poured through her with such force , they made other people nervous . Deliberately she leaned back into the chair , crossed her legs , and waited for the old lawyer to tell her what she already knew : her grandmother had no worldly goods worth mentioning . Hingham 's chair creaked sharply as he sat . " I take it you do n't need all the ruffles and flourishes . " " Correct . " He nodded and shifted papers . " Your inheritance is what remains of the house and five acres it sits on . There are no liens nor outstanding debts . " He handed a plat map and deed across the desk to Serena . " The taxes have been paid through last year . I filed for a reappraisal due to the fire . "            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
