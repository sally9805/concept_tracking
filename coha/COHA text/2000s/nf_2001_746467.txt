ABSTRACT . We used pairs of slides showing 3 women and 3 men displaying 2 sex-linked carrying styles to examine differences in the attribution of homosexuality as a consequence of behavioral displays that are either sex typical or sex atypical . We hypothesized that the participants would be less likely to view targets displaying sex-typical behaviors as gay men or as lesbians . Each of 2 groups of U.S. university students rated targets in 6 slides on homosexuality and 3 other traits . The mean difference in rated homosexuality for typical versus atypical carrying styles was small but statistically significant . Thus , the results provide some empirical support for the common belief that effeminate men and masculine women are more likely to be seen as homosexual , at least by U.S. university students . <p> Key words : attributions of homosexuality , sex-atypical carrying styles , sex-typical carrying styles , U.S. university students . <p> People 's reactions to individuals believed to be gay men or lesbians are different from their reactions to straight people ( Marmor , 1980 ; Mondimore , 1996 ) . Nonetheless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay or lesbian sexual orientation because there has been almost no research indicating how people make judgments about the sexual orientation of others . This surprising gap in research demands investigation , particularly because it seems commonplace for people to make attributions about the sexual orientation of strangers on the basis of brief observation : According to one large survey ( Levitt &; Klassen , 1974 ) , nearly 40% of adults claimed that they could recognize gay men and lesbians by " how they look . " <p> We based the present study on the hypothesis that sex-atypical appearance or behavior would increase the likelihood of the attribution of homosexuality to men and , perhaps , to women . That hypothesis reflects a common U.S. stereotype ( Storms , 1978 ) and is supported by ample anecdotal reports that gay men often have effeminate mannerisms , whereas lesbians often have noticeably masculine traits . Empirical support for the hypothesis , however , is limited and somewhat inconsistent ( Finlay &; Scheltema , 1991 ) . On the one hand , a few researchers ( Churchill , 1967 ; Voeller , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay men and lesbians can be identified by stereotypic cues ( e.g. , a man 's effeminacy ) , only a minority of the U.S. gay and lesbian population actually exhibits such traits . Moreover , detection of homosexuality on the basis of visual observation may be quite difficult ( Berger , Hank , Rauzi , &; Simkins , 1987 ) . On the other hand , homosexual men , compared with heterosexual men , rated themselves as much more effeminate ( Schatzberg , Westfall , Blumetti , &; Birk , 1975 ) , reported having been far more effeminate during childhood , and were more likely to view themselves as feminine ( Saghir &; Robins , 1973 ) . Likewise , there is considerable evidence of increased androgyny and masculinity in lesbians ( Finlay &; Scheltema , 1991 ; LaTorre &; Wendenburg , 1983 ; Saghir &; Robins , 1973 ) . Certainly some inconsistency is expected , given that gay men 's and lesbians ' willingness to display sex-atypical behaviors may vary with social and cultural context ( e.g. , may be more likely to appear within a tolerant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ et al. , 1979 ; Ross , 1983 ) . <p> Although the incidence and impact of actual behavioral differences between homosexual and heterosexual people are somewhat controversial , existing research clearly supports the claim of distinct stereotypes for homosexual adults . It seems particularly clear that people believe that gay men are higher in femininity and that lesbians are higher in masculinity than their heterosexual counterparts ( McCreary , 1994 ; Taylor , 1983 ) . Perhaps because unattractive women may be less feminine , they may be more likely to be seen as lesbians ( Dew , 1985 ; Dunkle &; Francis , 1990 ) . Dunkle and Francis found that higher homosexuality ratings were assigned to feminine male faces and to masculine female faces than to more typical faces . A single feminine trait may be sufficient for some people to attribute homosexuality to a man ( Dunbar , Brown , &; Amoroso , 1973 ) . <p> Carrying style tends to differ between men and women and , therefore , may make people appear either more or less sex typical . A man often carries books at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is more likely ( a ) to carry books in front of her body with her arms cradling the books or ( b ) to carry the books at her side , where they rest on her hip bone . This tendency appears to be a widespread phenomenon , with some biological basis , that has been observed in a variety of cultures ( Alley &; Kolker , 1988 ; D. A. Jenni &; Jenni , 1976 ; M. A. Jenni &; Jenni , 1978 ; Spottswood &; Burghardt , 1976 ) . <p> We designed the present study to detect the influence of typical and atypical 662 The Journal of Social Psychology carrying styles on attributions about homosexuality in male and female targets . Specifically , we hypothesized that adults with sex-atypical carrying styles would receive higher ratings of homosexuality than would those with sex-typical carrying styles . Furthermore , we expected this tendency to be more pronounced for the male than for the female targets . <p> One reason for hypothesizing that carrying styles may have less effect on attributions for women less is that previous researchers have found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sex-typical carrying styles . Very few men used feminine carrying styles , whereas as many as half the women ( see Thommen , Reith , &; Steffen , 1993 ) used masculine carrying styles . That finding may be related to a second reason for expecting less impact of carrying style on attributions to women-namely , that U.S. society has a greater tolerance for masculine behavior in women than for feminine behavior in men ( Green , 1980 ; McCreary , 1994 ; Saghir &; Robins , 1980 ; Wells , 1992 ) . Consequently , sex-atypical carrying styles may be more salient and influential when displayed by men . Method <p> Participants <p> The participants in the present study were 157 students from introductory psychology courses at a public university in the southeastern United States . Most of the volunteers received extra credit for participating . There were 93 women ( mean age = 18.5 years , SD = 0.97 ) , 59 men ( mean age = 18.8 years , SD = 0.97 ) , and 5 students who did not report their sex . <p> Materials <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for use as targets ; we used 35-mm color-slide film . We photographed each target person holding books or similar materials-once in a sex-typical position and once in a sex-atypical fashion . The materials held varied across targets , as did the background , distance from the camera , lighting , attire , and so forth . All such variables , including facial expression and all aspects of posture except for the carrying position , were held constant across the two photographs of each target . <p> In the photographs of the sex-typical carrying style for men , the male target 's arm was extended fully at the side of his body , with the materials held by a hand supporting them from below . In the photographs of the sex-typical carrying style for women , the female target had both arms wrapped around the materials , with her elbows flexed and the materials held in front of her body . In the photographs of targets with sex-atypical styles , each target posed using the typical style of the opposite sex . <p> Procedure <p> We separated the 12 slides into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ photograph of each target ; half displayed sex-typical , and half sex-atypical , carrying styles . Each group of participants saw only one set of 6 slides . We told the participants that the study concerned " person perception " and asked them to use their first impression to rate each target on 9-point Likert-type scales for each of four characteristics : dishonest/honest , anxious/relaxed , shy/outgoing , and homosexual/heterosexual ( 1 = **32;1321;TOOLONG , 9 = honest/ **29;1355;TOOLONG ) . We also asked the participants to identify the sex of each target and to indicate whether they thought they were familiar with any of the targets . <p> The participants sat approximately 4 to 5.5 m from a screen in a dimly lit room . The 35-mm slides were projected with an image size of 81 x 121 cm . The experimenter read the directions before showing each slides for 14.4 . The slides were presented in a different random order for each group of participants . After the participants had viewed all 6 slides and completed their answer sheets , we debriefed them . Results <p> The participants were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for participants to be acquainted with a target ( or merely to think that a target was familiar ) and to base their ratings on their impressions of that acquaintance rather than on the appearance of the photographed target . Consequently , we included a question about familiarity for every target and removed from the analyses all ratings of targets reported to be familiar . Meaningful results from the present study were also dependent on the correct identification of the sex of each target . This problem was easily solved because the appearance of all targets was clearly appropriate or typical for members of their sex ( e.g. , all women had long hair , and all men had detectable facial hair ) . The participants correctly identified target sex on 446 of 461 trials ( 96.7% ) for male targets and on 442 out of 458 trials ( 97.8% ) for female targets . The error rate was not higher for targets displaying atypical carrying styles . Some of the errors probably reflected observers ' coding errors rather than the participants ' misperceptions of target sex . <p> To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of homosexuality separately for targets with atypical and typical carrying styles . The mean difference in rated homosexuality for typical versus atypical carrying styles was small ( M = 0.27 , S D = 1.27 ) but statistically significant , t(155) = 2.60 , p = .01 . Although we expected the effect to be larger for male targets , there was no difference between male and female targets in the ratings , t(143) = .05 , p = .958 . Discussion <p> The present study provides some empirical support for the expectation that effeminate men and masculine women are more likely to be seen as gay men and lesbians , respectively . However , one should not generalize the results beyond the population of young U.S. adults sampled . Nor can the results be safely extended to children , for whom carrying styles may be less sex specific and for whom some varieties of sex role transgressions may be less salient . In addition , the evidence that effeminate men and masculine women are more likely to be seen as gay men and lesbians , respectively , should not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more likely to be or to become gay men or lesbians , respectively . <p> The results support the hypothesis that sex-atypical carrying behavior is sufficient to increase the perceived likelihood of homosexuality in adults . The ratings of homosexuality for targets with sex-atypical carrying styles were significantly , although only slightly , higher than were those for the same targets displaying sex-typical carrying styles . Perhaps other sex-related carrying styles would produce more pronounced effects on attributions of homosexuality . The feminine style ( in which books are rested on the hip ) seems particularly worth investigating because the greater hip protrusion in women provides some biological basis for a sex difference in the use of this style ( Scheman , Lockard , &; Mehler , 1978 ) . Thus , men may be more likely to appear feminine when using this style than when using other feminine carrying positions . In any case , the present results are consistent with the apparently common belief that effeminate men and masculine women are more likely to be seen as gay men and lesbians , respectively . <p> The fact that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly appropriate or typical for members of their sex may have diminished the perception of homosexuality for targets with sex-atypical carrying styles , although the targets ' appearance ensured correct identification of target sex . Likewise , it seems likely that attributions of homosexuality would have been higher if multiple sex-atypical traits had been present in the same person ( e.g. , a short-haired woman with a masculine carrying style ) . Future researchers should investigate such expectations and examine other appearance variables that may be more powerful determinants of gender typicality in person perception than is variation in carrying style . Although previous researchers reported marked sex differences in carrying styles , more recent investigators have indicated that the sex differences have been reduced and that adults often use book bags , backpacks , or other such devices to carry their materials ( Alley &; Kolker , 1988 ; McKelvie , 1993 ; Thommen et al. , 1993 ) . Consequently , sex differences in the manner of carrying loose materials are likely to be less salient now than in the past . Additional research using variation in behavior ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) that is more clearly correlated with sex is needed to verify that effeminate men and masculine women are indeed more likely to be seen as gay men and lesbians , respectively . <p> A preliminary report of this study was presented in April 1997 at the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Southeastern Psychological Association in Atlanta , GA . <p> Address correspondence to Thomas R.
