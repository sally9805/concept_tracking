Wednesday , May 26 " You nailed him , Martha . " I know it 's Geraldine Schilling without looking up . She 's the only one in the office  --  or anywhere else for that matter  --  who calls me Martha . Geraldine is the First Assistant District Attorney for Barnstable County , a county that includes all the towns on Cape Cod . She intends to be Barnstable County 's next District Attorney , a position no woman has ever held . " You nailed him . Now let 's go in there and finish it . " " I 'm ready , Geraldine . " I snap my briefcase shut and gesture for Geraldine to take the only empty seat in my cramped office . " But Judge Carroll released the jurors for lunch . He 'll call for closing arguments when they get back . " Geraldine does n't sit down . She never does . She leans against my old wooden file cabinet instead , pressing a spiked heel against the bottom drawer . She draws hard on her cigarette and rolls her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who the hell eats lunch ? " There is a widely held belief in our office that Geraldine does n't eat  --  ever . All of us have seen her attend professional luncheons and political dinners , but no one has seen her swallow a morsel of food . Caffeine and nicotine seem to keep her going . She weighs 110 pounds wearing her neatly tailored suit . Kevin Kydd appears in my doorway , grinning as usual . " I do . I eat lunch . Where are we going , ladies ? " He always makes me laugh . But Geraldine does n't crack a smile . She shakes her long blond bangs and blows a steady stream of smoke toward the doorway . " Lunch with you , Kydd ? I 'd sooner starve . " His grin expands . " Ah , Gerry , you 're a peach . " Kevin Kydd arrived in our office one year ago , a young Southern gentleman fresh out of Emory Law School in Atlanta , Georgia . He is tall and lanky , with slightly stooped shoulders and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kydd " immediately upon his arrival and the rest of us adopted it . He , in turn , calls her " Gerry , " always with the grin . We marvel that he still has a job . The Kydd ambles in and settles in the chair Geraldine rejected . " How about you , Marty ? My treat . " " Thanks , Kydd , but I 'll have to pass . I 'm expecting Judge Carroll 's clerk to call any time now . We 're closing Rodriguez this afternoon . " " Mind if I watch ? " The Kydd 's question is intended more for Geraldine than for me , but I answer him quickly . " Not a bit . " I remember my early days in this office , handling the traffic offenses and bounced checks that the Kydd is stuck with now , waiting for an opportunity to prosecute a " real " crime . Whenever I could , I watched closing arguments in the more serious cases . I watched Geraldine in action in a number of trials . She does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her day . The old black phone on my desk does n't finish its first ring before I grab it . " Marty Nickerson . " It 's Wanda Morgan , Judge Carroll 's courtroom clerk . The jury is back ; the judge is calling for summations . I head for the door . The Kydd reaches it before I do , but he pauses to look back at Geraldine , to verify that he has her permission . She blows a smoke ring at him . " Go ahead , " she says . " Maybe you 'll learn something . "
