Cutting-edge news from a source you can trust . Hernia Surgery : A Case for Watchful Waiting <p> Men with the most common type of hernia who are without pain may want to consider " watchful waiting " before opting for surgery , according to the January 18 issue of JAMA . <p> The study targeted middle-aged men with hernias near the groin known in medical jargon as " inguinal " hernias . <p> " Many men with inguinal hernia have minimal symptoms , " writes lead author Dr. Robert Fitzgibbons , Jr. , and colleagues . " Whether deferring surgical repair is a safe and accept able option has not been assessed . Surgical repair , while generally safe and effective , carries long-term risk of hernia recurrence , pain , and discomfort . " <p> An inguinal hernia occurs when tissue or part of the intestine protrudes through a weak portion of the abdominal wall , causing a tender bulge in the groin or scrotum , in the past , doctors believed that most people required surgery to avoid the danger of the tissue becoming trapped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Data from the recent study show , however , that the risk of hernia incarceration is minimal over a two-year period . In another key finding , men who opted for surgical repair reported similar levels of pain and discomfort as those who did not undergo hernia surgery . <p> In an accompanying editorial , Dr , David Flum from the University of Washington in Seattle writes : " Surgeons have been struggling for years to avoid the greatest harm in patients with incidentally identified hernia . . Avoiding harm in this case is easy  --  it can best be accomplished by counseling and educating patients and only repairing hernias that cause symptoms . " <p> Inguinal hernia <p> Rapid Test for Urinary Infection <p> Promising technology may someday allow doctors to discover the cause of urinary tract infections ( UTIs ) in 45 minutes , compared to two days using conventional tests . The new diagnostic tool will allow physicians to prescribe targeted treatment without delay . <p> In a recent clinical trial conducted at UCLA 's school of medicine and the Veterans Affairs Greater Los Angeles Healthcare System , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identify the species of infection-causing bacteria in 98 percent of the study samples . <p> Data were reported in the Feb. 2006 issue of the Journal of Clinical Microbiology . The research team anticipates the rapid test could become available in the next two to three years . <p> Novel technology to detect bacteria saves time  --  and precious healthcare dollars . <p> Some Socks Better than Others ? <p> Intriguing findings from the University of Missouri-Columbia suggest that choosing the right socks may help keep feet healthy  --  research findings that may certainly benefit diabetics , as well as athletes . <p> Engineering students used a motorized device designed to calculate the point at which the test material slips against a platform . The team found that athletic socks made of synthetic materials produced less friction than the 100-percent cotton varieties and were less likely to cause blisters . Socks made from special nylon filaments designed for quick drying characteristics performed better than ordinary nylon . <p> The material  --  not the price  --  of the sock is key . In the study , some inexpensive socks performed as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Teens <p> Nonmedical use of prescription drugs is a serious problem among American teens , warns JoBeth McCarthy-Jean , a researcher at the Indiana Prevention Resource Center at Indiana University , Bloomington . <p> " ' Pharming " is a term used to describe taking prescription drugs from family medicine cabinets for recreational or experimental purposes . <p> " Many times children perceive prescription drugs in the home as safe and are not aware of how dangerous it is to take these medicines without a prescription , " she explains , In addition to serious health risks , teens caught possessing medications without a prescription can face drug charges equivalent to possession of illegal narcotics . <p> To discourage misuse of prescription drugs : <p> Talk with your child about the dangers of taking nonprescribed drugs ; <p> Dispose of unused medication ; <p> Encourage participation in school and extracurricular activities ; <p> Approve of chaperoned parties only : <p> Monitor financial expenditures and Internet purchases and activities . <p> Signs that a child may be abusing prescription drugs include changes in patterns of behavior , difficulty sleeping or staying awake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New Hope for Sleep Apnea <p> A promising treatment option  --  previously approved to reduce snoring  --  may also help people with mild to moderate sleep apnea . The minimally invasive " Pillar " Procedure involves placing three small implants in the patient 's soft palate located at the back of the roof of the mouth . Scar tissue that forms around the implant helps stiffen the palate to prevent or re duce the risk of it blocking the airway during sleep . <p> Research findings demonstrate that the procedure , performed under local aresthetic , is safe and effective . No tissue is removed , and the implants may be removed if desired . <p> Sleep apnea is linked to heart disease , stroke , impotence , and high blood pressure .

Pillar implants stiffen the palate to help treat obstructive sleep apnea and reduce snoring . <p> Taking Aim at Prostate Cancer <p> New research confirms that brachytherapy , an advanced cancer treatment where radioactive seeds are placed in or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cancer . The study shows that 96 percent of the participants survived the disease a decade after treatment . <p> Brachytherapy or " seed " therapy , delivers a high dose of radiation to tumor cells while reducing radiation exposure to surrounding healthy tissue . The radiation contained in each implanted seed gradually diminishes over time , and the total amount of radiation delivered to the prostate is less than that delivered through other radiation treatments . <p> During the procedure , doctors use hollow needles to permanently implant between 80 and 120 seeds containing iodine or palladium into the prostate . A mapping template serves as a guide for needle placement to assure that each seed is placed exactly where intended . Patients typically return to normal activities within one or two days with minimal restrictions . The total procedure generally lasts less than two hours . Side effects include a risk of impotence and incontinence , frequent urination and , occasionally , blood in the urine . Other Prostate Cancer Therapies <p> Surgery  --  Also called radical prostatectomy , this procedure involves removal of the entire prostate gland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The procedure typically requires a hospital stay of two to five days . The most common complications are impotence and incontinence . <p> External Beam Radiation  --  Utilizes radiation to stop the growth of cancer cells . Multiple beams of radiation are delivered through normal tissue to the site of the cancer . The therapy has demonstrated a fairly high cure rate in early cancers and the risk of impotence and incontinence is lower than that associated with surgery . Daily visits to the hospital are required for about two months . Risks include radiation damage to healthy tissue , fatigue , nausea , and rectal irritation or bleeding . <p> Hormone Therapy  --  The goal of hormone therapy is to lower the level of the male hormones ( androgens ) , as well as to promote shrinking of the prostate gland , and a slowdown in the growth of the tumor . The approach may relieve disease symptoms and make the gland more receptive to other treatments . Disadvantages include impotence , infertility , cardiovascular problems , and nausea . <p> Cryosurgery  --  A form of therapy that freezes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( local or general ) , the doctor uses ultrasound guidance to insert six to eight slender probes through the skin into the prostate gland . The procedure takes about two hours . Many patients resume normal activity in less than a week . Most patients will be impotent if the entire prostate is frozen . <p> " Watchful Waiting "  --  Involves regular and careful observation of the prostate gland . This conservative course of action is typically used for slow-growing tumors or for the oldest patients . <p> Experimental Drug Therapy  --  Researchers at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles say that raloxifene , a prescription drug used for osteoporosis , may help fight prostate cancer . In a preliminary study , some of the patients taking a daily dose of raloxifene showed clinical evidence of a slowing or stopping of the growth of their prostate cancer . <p> Each seed measures roughly 4.5 millimeter in size . <p> Health Recipe of the Month Spinach Souffl TABLE <p> Drain spinach well , pressing between paper towels to remove excess liquid .
