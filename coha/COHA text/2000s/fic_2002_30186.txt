1 . There was a new student in the Watertower Elementary School . She arrived in October , after the first month of school had already passed . She opened the second grade classroom door at ten o'clock on a Wednesday morning and appeared there all alone , without even a mother to introduce her . She was wearing pajamas and cowboy boots and was holding a dictionary and a lunch box . " Hello , " Mrs. Pidgeon , the second grade teacher , said . " We 're in the middle of our spelling lesson . " " Good , " said the girl in pajamas . " I brought my dictionary . Where 's my desk ? " " Who are you ? " Mrs. Pidgeon asked politely . " I 'm your new student . My name is Gooney Bird Greene  --  that 's Greene with a silent ' e ' at the end  --  and I just moved here from China . I want a desk right smack in the middle of the room , because I like to be right smack in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new girl with admiration . They had never met anyone like Gooney Bird Greene . She was a good student . She sat down at the desk Mrs. Pidgeon provided , right smack in the middle of everything , and began doing second grade spelling . She did all her work neatly and quickly , and she followed instructions . But soon it was clear that Gooney Bird was mysterious and interesting . Her clothes were unusual . Her hairstyles were unusual . Even her lunches were very unusual . At lunchtime on Wednesday , her first day in the school , she opened her lunch box and brought out sushi and a pair of bright green chopsticks . On Thursday , her second day at Watertower Elementary School , Gooney Bird Greene was wearing a pink ballet tutu over green stretch pants , and she had three smallred grapes , an avocado , and an oatmeal cookie for lunch . On Thursday afternoon , after lunch , Mrs. Pidgeon stood in front of the class with a piece of chalk in her hand . " Today , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories . " " Yay ! " the second-graders said in very loud voices , all but Felicia Ann , who never spoke , and Malcolm , who was n't paying attention . He was under his desk , as usual . " Gooney Bird , you were n't here for the first month of school . But our class has been learning about what makes good stories , have n't we ? " Mrs. Pidgeon said . Everyone nodded . All but Malcolm , who was under his desk doing something with scissors . " Class ? What does a story need most of all ? Who remembers ? " Mrs. Pidgeon had her chalk hand in the air , ready to write something on the board . The children were silent for a minute . They were thinking . Finally Chelsea raised her hand . " Chelsea ? What does a story need ? " " A book , " Chelsea said . Mrs. Pidgeon put her chalk hand down . " There are many stories that do n't need a book , " she said pleasantly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a story about when she was a little girl , she does n't have that story in a book , does she ? " The class stared at her . All but Malcolm , who was still under his desk , and Felicia Ann , who always looked at the floor , never raised her hand , and never spoke . Beanie said , " My grandma lives in Boston ! " Keiko said , " My grandma lives in Honolulu ! " Ben said loudly , " My grandma lives in Harrisburg , Pennsylvania ! " Tricia shouted , " My grandma is very rich ! " " Class ! " said Mrs. Pidgeon . " Shhh ! " Then , in a quieter voice , she explained , " Another time , we will talk about our families . But right now  --  " She stopped talking and looked at Barry Tuckerman . Barry was up on his knees in his seat , and his hand was waving in the air as hard as he could make it wave . " Barry ? " Mrs. Pidgeon said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? Something that can not possibly wait ? " Barry nodded yes . His hand waved . " And what is so important ? " Barry stood up beside his desk . Barry Tuckerman liked to make very important speeches , and they always required that he stand . " My grandma , " Barry Tuckerman said , " went to jail once . She was twenty years old and she went to jail for civil disobedience . " Then Barry sat down . " Thank you , Barry . Now look at what I 'm writing on the board . Who can read this word ? " Everyone , all but Malcolm and Felicia Ann , watched as she wrote the long word . Then they shouted it out . " BEGINNING ! " " Good ! " said Mrs. Pidgeon . " Now I 'm sure you 'll all know this one . " She wrote again . " MIDDLE ! " the children shouted . " Good . And can you guess what the last word will be ? " She held up her chalk and waited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pidgeon said . " Good for you , second-graders ! Those are the parts that a story needs : a beginning , a middle , and an end . Now I 'm going to write another very long word on the board . Let 's see what good readers you are . " She wrote a C , then an H. " Mrs. Pidgeon ! " someone called . She wrote an A , and then an R. " MRS . PIDGEON ! " Several children were calling now . She turned to see what was so important . Malcolm was standing beside his desk . He was crying . " Malcolm needs to go to the nurse , Mrs. Pidgeon ! " Beanie said . Mrs. Pidgeon went to Malcolm and knelt beside him . " What 's the trouble , Malcolm ? " she asked . But he could n't stop crying . " I know , I know ! " Nicholas said . Nicholas always knew everything , and his desk was beside Malcolm 's . " Tell me , Nicholas . " " Remember Keiko showed us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second-graders reached into their desks and their pockets and their lunch boxes . There were tiny stars everywhere . Keiko had shown them how to make origami stars out of small strips of paper . The stars were very easy to make . The school janitor had complained just last Friday that he was sweeping up hundreds of origami stars . " Malcolm put one in his nose , " Nicholas said , " and now he ca n't get it out . " " Is that correct , Malcolm ? " Mrs. Pidgeon asked . Malcolm nodded and wiped his eyes . " Do n't sniff , Malcolm . Do not sniff . That is an order . " She took his hand and walked with him to the classroom door . She turned to the class . " Children , " she said , " I am going to be gone for exactly one minute and thirty seconds while I walk with Malcolm to the nurse 's office down the hall . Stay in your seats while I 'm gone . Think about the word character . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the nurse 's office , we are going to create a story together . You must choose who the main character will be . Talk among yourselves quietly . Think about interesting characters like Abraham Lincoln , or perhaps Christopher Columbus , or  --  " " Babe Ruth ? " called Ben . " Yes , Babe Ruth is a possibility . I 'll be right back . " Mrs. Pidgeon left the classroom with Malcolm . When she returned , one minute and thirty seconds later , without Malcolm , the class was waiting . They had been whispering , all but Felicia Ann , who never whispered . " Have you chosen ? " she asked . The class nodded . All of their heads went up and down , except Felicia Ann 's , because she always looked at the oor . " And your choice is  --  ? " All of the children , all but Felicia Ann , called out together . " Gooney Bird Greene ! " they called . Mrs. Pidgeon sighed . " Class , " she said , " there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about imaginary creatures , like  --  " " Dumbo ! " Tricia called out . " Raise your hand if you want to speak , please , " Mrs. Pidgeon said . " But yes , Tricia , you are correct . Dumbo is an imaginary character . There are also stories about real people from history , like Christopher Columbus , and  --  " She stopped . Barry Tuckerman was waving and waving his hand . " Yes , Barry ? Do you have something very important to say ? " Barry Tuckerman stood up . He twisted the bottom of his shirt around and around in his fingers . " I forget , " he said at last . " Well , sit back down then , Barry . Now , I thought , class , that since Christopher Columbus 's birthday is coming up soon  --  " She looked at Barry Tuckerman , whose hand was waving like a windmill once again . " Barry ? " she said . Barry Tuckerman stood up again . " We already know all the stories about Christopher Columbus , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story about Gooney Bird Greene . " " Yes ! Gooney Bird Greene ! " the class called . Mrs. Pidgeon sighed again . " I 'm afraid I do n't know many facts abut Gooney Bird Greene , " she said . " I know a lot of facts about Christopher Columbus , though . Christopher Columbus was born in  --  " " We want Gooney Bird ! " the class chanted . " Gooney Bird ? " Mrs. Pidgeon said , finally . " How do you feel about this ? " Gooney Bird Greene stood up beside her desk in the middle of the room . " Can I tell the story ? " she asked . " Can I be right smack in the middle of everything ? Can I be the hero ? " " Well , since you would be the main character , " Mrs. Pidgeon said , " I guess that would put you in the middle of everything . I guess that would make you the hero . " " Good , " Gooney Bird said . " I will tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
