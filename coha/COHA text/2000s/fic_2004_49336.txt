Alex Irvine 's first novel , A Scattering of Jades , won several awards last year . His next one , One King , One Soldier , is due out in july . Subterranean Press recently published a collection of his short fiction , Unintended Consequences , which led Publishers Weekly to call him " An agent provocateur of escapist surrealism . " Perhaps you 'll agree that there 's escapist surrealism in this story ( which first appeared in Unintended Consequences , ) , but around these parts , we just think it 's a good read . <p> I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE of owning a borzoi , which is a lot like having a dog but not exactly the same . The borzoi is refined yet childlike , a lethal hunter who cries if someone sits in his favorite spot on the couch . He is bundled paradox , joy , anxiety , devotion . he exasperates with his stubbornness , enchants with his grace , delights with his buffoonery .. . but let us not forget that he was bred to hunt down wolves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not tell Detectives Brower and Glenn when they interviewed me the day after Kenny Kazlauskas came over to my house to kill me . It all started when a violent and larcenous acquaintance of mine named Arthur Czyz discovered that armored cars have to stop at weigh stations . The stations are labeled for all commercial vehicles , so it 's not exactly a surprise that this should be true , but in addition to being violent and larcenous Arthur was kind of dumb . He was , however , possessed of what a Victorian judge might have called animal cunning . So when he found out about armored cars and weigh stations , he knew immediately that he 'd found a way to take an armored car . Problem was , he did n't know what that way was . This is why he had more intelligent friends like me . Greg , he said to me one day . We were at Otto 's Coffeehouse in Allston . I like the college vibe there even though it 's a long time since I was in college . Arthur just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scared of him , plus he likes Otto 's coffee and the place is right on Commonwealth Avenue next to one of Arthur 's early morning stops . Arthur drives an overnight pastry and dairy truck , covering Newton , Brookline , and Allston . Into the warehouse in Revere at three A.M. , out at four A. M. , back to the warehouse by eight to reload for the places that are n't open when he starts his first round . He 's off by noon if he can avoid traffic , which nobody can do in Boston , a city whose streets still follow the deer tracks widened by the Passamaquoddy Indians back in the day . I 'm usually seated at one of the tables out front of Otto 's by seven on any given morning , with Boris standing at my side looking over my shoulder while I read the Globe . Borzois do n't like to sit , and they 're so bony they do n't much like to lie on concrete either . So Boris was my clock when we went to Otto 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd start to grumble and whine . If car engines sounded like howling dogs , a borzoi 's whine would be an exact replica of the engine turning over right before it started . Owrowrowrowmrr . " Greg , " Arthur said . " Arthur , " I said back . He sat down at the empty chair on the other side of the table . " We could knock over an armored car , " he said . Unlike Arthur , I am not violent . I do , though , confess to a certain larcenous tendency . It keeps me in chai and scones and permits me to begin my days at Otto 's instead of behind the wheel of one of the cars that obstructs Arthur 's route through Boston every morning . I set down the Globe . Boris sniffed it over , looked at me . I gave him a piece of my scone . His ears shot up when he saw it , but he took it with great delicacy , another borzoi characteristic not shared with more mundane breeds . " How could we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked . There were no police in evidence , but I did n't like the direction the conversation was taking ; although I had no record , Arthur did . " They have to stop at weigh stations , " he said . " You do n't say , " I said . " Where 'd you hear this ? " He shrugged . " Kenny said something about it . " That put an end to the conversation as far as I was concerned . When he was n't driving the truck for his father 's dairy ( and , as I was later to discover , even when he was ) , Arthur did various unsavory jobs for Kenny Kazlauskas , one of the new breed of organized-crime figure who had popped up in East Coast cities after the breaking of the Cosa Nostra . Kenny K. was sociopathic , irrational , unencumbered by notions of loyalty , and superstitious as a Haitian grandmother - and this last quality had bred in him an intense hatred of yours truly because he thought I was a magician . I supplemented @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of antiques . Boston has antique dealers like Washington , D.C. has lobbyists , and my particular niche was a curious ability to locate and possess items allegedly possessed of supernatural qualities . During the previous ten years , I 'd either acquired or brokered the acquisition of a Dale Chihuly sculpture that acted as an aphrodisiac , an Austrian grandfather clock said to confer immortality , a golden cobra from a pharaoh 's tomb that animated when its owner 's life was threatened , and an antiquated stock ticker that purportedly predicted the market with unfailing accuracy . And many more . The truth is , I never put much stock in any of the stories that accrued around old and valuable things ; I 'd never seen any evidence of magic , and remained a confirmed agnostic on the subject . Nevertheless , my reputation , to a brain as paranoid and cocaineaddled as Kenny 's , made me a prime candidate for burning at the stake . Which in turn made me not at all inclined to do a potentially violent job that might in addition turn out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I should have made this clear to Arthur , but he spoke before I could articulate my objection . " All 's we 'd have to do is make sure that we 'd cleared out the weigh station before the armored car got there , " he said . " That and get away afterwards , " I amended . " It 's not going to work if we leave the scene by merging into traffic on 1-95 again , is it ? " " You 're the detail guy , " Arthur said . " Plans are your thing . I just had this idea . I think you ought to think about it . " " I will , " I said , and he climbed back into his truck and drove away in a belch of unbumed diesel . And I did . I thought about it and I decided that like most of Arthur 's ideas , it was immensely risky and likely to end badly . I 'm a housebreaker by trade . Occasionally I set other things up , but I rarely deal in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs that involve armed opponents in public places . just to be certain , though - and very much against my better judgment - I started making some inquiries to people I knew in the highway department , and one of them knew someone who knew someone in Maine , and this someone happened to know that there was a gate at the rear of the parking lot of a certain weigh station on a certain state highway in Maine . Installed , it appeared , to preserve access to paper company land that was being cut off by the construction of the highway . Knowing this was one of the worst things that ever happened to me . BORIS AND I camped in the backcountry for a few days , canoeing through northern Maine 's beautiful flatwater and watching stars at night . I live in Boston , but I like to get out into the woods . And Boris , despite being a refined animal , had a back-to-nature streak in his heart . he did n't even mind canoeing . I only minded it myself when he tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a puppy he tipped us a couple of times before I convinced him that we were all better off if he stayed lying down until we got to shore . It occurred to me while I was poking at my campfire on the second night of the trip that I was looking for an excuse to do the job . Me , quiet and pacifistic Gregory Flynn , contemplating an armored-car heist - and with Arthur Czyz as my partner , no less . " Crazy , " I told Boris , but he was asleep , a white mat on the pineneedled riverbank . Be honest with yourself , I thought . This is about the Gronkjaer board . Every so often I become aware of an extremely valuable article that tests my professionalism . I want these items for myself despite the risk possession entails , or perhaps because of it . The Gronkjaer board was one such item . Like many of the pieces my clients came to me to acquire , this board had an occult history . Apparently a shipping magnate and amateur player had commissioned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had become so enraptured by it that he had spent more and more time playing the game by himself , falling in love with the feel of the pieces in his hands and with the way the squares gleamed in the lamplight . Soon he was neglecting his business and his wife , and it was not until she committed suicide in 1851 that he realized that he 'd allowed his immersion in the game to destroy him . She killed herself by slashing her wrists over the board , and died with the two kings clutched in her hands . He lost his house but kept the board , and executors of his estate eventually found a long and anguished series of journal entries stating that the spirit of his wife had come to occupy it . It is her revenge upon me , he wrote . That for which I abandoned her she now inhabits . I play , and the queen has her face , and the field of battle is as an infinitely variable topology of regret . After the magnate 's death in 1866 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often sold quickly because its owners found themselves playing to the exclusion of all else . The legend about it grew ; it was said that when great players took up the pieces , they found themselves replaying their most agonizing defeats . In any case , a long list of broken marriages , suicides , and even murders accompanied the board 's history , and the man who approached me to get it for him believed firmly that the board would always contain the spirit of the one person its owner had abandoned to loneliness and death . This all sounded a bit melodramatic to me , although like I said , I 've seen some odd things during the course of my career , but I went ahead and started planning the job . Then , the first time I saw the board , in the center of a paneled study on the third floor of an old mansion in Stamford , Connecticut , I realized I wanted it for myself . If the armored-car job came off , I could buy the Gronkjaer board . Legitimately . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current owner being non compos mentis and his oldest daughter anxious to sell off the old man 's curios before he died and she had to pay estate taxes on everything . Of course I could have just stolen it ; exactly such a commission had first brought the board to my attention . After looking into the household security , though , I 'd declined the job , and I still was n't confident I could pull it off . Easier to await the auction . Except I did n't have the money , which brought me right back to Arthur 's proposal and the real reason I was camping in western Maine instead of creeping a condominium in the Back Bay . Boris grumbled in his sleep , emitting that sound peculiar to the borzoi that resembles nothing so much as the low of a cow . I sat up , looking for shooting stars and wondering whether I believed in the story of the Gronkjaer board . The next morning , I left the canoe overturned under a stand of pine trees and hiked with Boris along a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after some time took a sharp right and dead-ended in an iron gate . No TRESPASSING , the gate said . STATE PROPERTY . NO ROAD ACCESS . Boris jumped over the gate - he could clear four or five feet from a standstill - and I ducked underneath it . About a hundred yards farther on , the road split . I turned right and twenty minutes later came up to a second gate . On the other side of it was a broad patch of concrete with a small office booth in the middle near the scale . " Well , what do you know , " I said to Boris . He started to trot out onto the lot , but I stopped him . People remember borzois , a fact that is a constant trial to a man in my profession . At times I wished I had gotten a lab or a spaniel . Or a gerbil . The borzoi , though , is an exceptional animal . " We 'd have to get one guy and use him to get the other guy out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I saw him . He sat at the table , spilling my chai . It dripped through the metal curlicues of the tabletop and spotted the sidewalk . Boris strained to get his muzzle all the way to the ground . At home his food and water dishes stood on a little platform , but here in the wilds of Allston he was on his own . " I was kind of thinking , you know , just overwhelm them with firepower , " he said . " This job works if nobody gets hurt , " I said . " Hurting people introduces complications , and raises the possibility that one of us will get hurt as well . " " You keep thinking about it , " he said , and got up . " I 'm only going to think for so long , " I said , " and then you 're going to have to tell me whether you want to go along with it or whether I 'm just going to schedule a second-story job over on Charles Street . " Boris sneezed when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It occurred to me not too much later that we would n't even need a car for the job . We could backpack in , do the job , backpack out , and pick up our car at one of the Appalachian Trail lots that dot western Maine 's backcountry roads . Easy . But Arthur did n't like it . " Hell , no , " he said in front of Otto 's the morning I brought it up . " You ca n't just walk away from a job like that . How the hell do you carry the money ? " " Well , that 's the thing , " I said . " We could n't carry all of it . But if we do this right , we 'll have enough time to go through the car so we do n't end up with a bag of singles . A car gives the police a real handle , something to look for . If the drivers say we walked away , then all the police will have to go on is descriptions of us . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This was true , and it was one of the reasons I 'd been a successful thief for nearly twenty years . I 'd been spotted in the middle of a job maybe half a dozen times , and every time the description given of me was different . People just did n't remember what I looked like . Arthur , I suspected , was a bit more recognizable , if for no other reason than he was a big man . But the world is full of big men , and if I was planning this enterprise correctly , any searchers would look right through us . Stores such as REI and Eastern Mountain Sports sell dog backpacks , but a borzoi is such a thin and deep-chested animal that no pack will hang right on him . Because of this , much of the load in my backpack ( rented under a name not my own from a Boston University outdoors organization ) was dog food . I encouraged Boris to eat heartily while we hiked from the trailhead where I 'd parked the rental car ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being clear whether we 'd be able to carry both backcountry gear and enough cash to make the job worthwhile ) southwest in the direction of our rendezvous with Arthur , who had taken a bus to Portland and from there hitchhiked north and west until he was well into the White Mountains . We were due to meet on the fire road I 'd walked with Boris some weeks before . It was the Monday after july 4th , following a weekend when-Arthur and I hoped - the good people of New England had left much of their money in the small towns of western Maine . The LockTrans truck , we had learned , made a weekly loop through several area municipalities , vacuuming up the deposits of seven small banks , two grocery stores , and the summer resort at the base of Maine 's finest ski mountain . I put the over-under on the job 's proceeds at just under half a million dollars . Arthur was more optimistic . Neither of us was sure how much of the cash we 'd be able to carry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Boris would just have to go hungry on the return leg of our journey . When I made the turn from the trail onto the fire road , Arthur was waiting . Boris trotted up to him and leaned his head into Arthur 's crotch , another habit of borzois that people have told me also exists in greyhounds . The action is n't the typical sniffing of a typical dog ; the borzoi leans to get affection , and the human groin is perfectly constructed to afford a tall and narrow-headed dog a place to rest . Arthur stood scratching behind Boris 's ears , but the look he directed at me was pure confusion . " What 's he doing here ? " he said . " He 's our cover . When the police start covering the trails , they 're not going to figure that armed robbers would bring a dog . " Arthur looked dubious , and when I had tied Boris to a tree out of sight of the road , he stopped me before we could walk away . " Is he going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendency toward violence , Arthur is soft-hearted when it comes to any animal other than Homo sapiens . " He 'll be fine , " I said as I was leaving the rest of Boris 's food in a heap on the ground within range of his tether . It would n't do to have to leave dog food at the scene of the crime for reasons of space . " He has water , and he 'll eat what he wants while we 're gone . " Which would n't be much ; Boris was a finicky eater . We did n't rehearse the plan again as we hiked the final five hundred yards or so to the weigh station 's rear gate ; Arthur and I had done enough jobs together that we knew when we did n't have to beat a dead horse . The plan was simple yet daring ; we would overpower the weigh-station attendant and Arthur , wearing his uniform , would wait until the LockTrans truck pulled onto the station lot and then walk out to close the gate . Inside the small office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a broker in specialized clothing ) would flip the switch that toggles the road sign from OPEN to CLOSED . As Arthur walked back , I would come out of the booth to examine the truck 's log , apologizing but saying a regulatory change made the action necessary . When the driver or passenger opened the door to give me the log , Arthur and I would draw our guns and get the guards out of the car . They would open the back for us , and we would skate off with however much money we could carry . We would also destroy the security recordings that are standard equipment on newer armored cars . Then it would be off into the wilderness , and back to Boston . Simple . It worked absolutely like clockwork . The weigh-station attendant froze at the sight of Arthur 's gun , said , " But we ai n't got money here , " and then fainted dead away . Arthur changed into his uniform and I into mine , and just as we finished our preparations the LockTrans truck pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already walking out to the gate , and after lighting the CLOSED message on the sign I had no trouble getting the driver to give up first the log and then his and his fellow 's guns . Arthur kept the two drivers in the front seat while I popped the back door , destroyed the recording equipment , and stuffed Arthur 's backpack with money . I had filled Arthur 's pack and was about to start on mine when , in the distance , I heard the unmistakable owrowrowrowrrr of an agitated borzoi . Things would have been all right . I believe that . It is evident to me . If only Arthur had not leaned out from the side of the truck and said , " Is that your dog ? " I told you he was n't very bright . Several things happened at once then . I lost my composure and said , " Are you some kind of goddamn idiot ? " and Arthur looked at me with an expression of terrible hurt before glancing back into the front seat of the LockTrans truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder blew away in a spray of blood . As Arthur stumbled backward , he emptied his gun into the truck 's passenger compartment . I was already running , thinking Idiot , you goddamn idiot . Of course one of them had another piece under the dash . When I got to the back gate , I looked over my shoulder and could not believe what I saw . Arthur had stopped to get his backpack , the one I 'd loaded with money , and he was staggering toward the station attendant 's car like a GI making the beachhead on Guadalcanal . THE USEFULNESS of Boris as cover would only last until one of the LockTrans guards , if either had survived Arthur 's fusillade , mentioned Arthur 's inopportune comment . I was a good three hours from where I 'd parked the rental , and I hoped that would be enough time to get moving in the car before the police heard about the dog connection . As I hiked , climbing along the edge of a forested gorge with a clear rushing stream at its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of an Injured Partner : Please let him have the sense not to go to the hospital . Arthur had that much sense , I thought , but you could never tell . People with bullets in them tended to get irrational . My plan was to get the car and head up into northern New Hampshire for a week or so , maybe Vermont . Pitch a tent , go canoeing , wait for the police to form their initial opinions , then go home and try to make contact with Arthur . Along the way I 'd get rid of the clothes and shoes I 'd worn to do the job , wrap them around a large rock and drop them into one of the deep lakes that dot northern New England . My precautions were probably excessive . I 'd never been arrested , never even been questioned by Boston police . In the aboveground economy , I was just another antiques broker who made his living putting buyers and sellers in touch with each other . We 're quiet people , unremarkable . We have museum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caution was one reason the police had never had cause to think of Gregory Flynn and larceny at the same time , so I went on being careful and hoped the authorities would go on looking elsewhere when it came to certain unlawful acts committed in the New England states . In the event , I arrived home six days after the robbery , dropped the car off at the rental agency , and took the Green Line back to my house in Brookline Village . Boris liked riding the T , and he was an unusual enough breed that most fellow riders suspended their natural disinclination to share their commute with a dog . I knew that someone had been in my house as soon as I opened the door . It 's a talent I think all professional thieves have . We 've skulked in and out of so many places that we develop a kind of intuition about when someone has been skulking in ours . The gun I 'd carried to do the LockTrans job was at the bottom of Lake Willoughby , far away in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owned a licensed .38 automatic , but it was upstairs in my bureau . If anyone was lying in wait for me , they 'd have little opposition ; I 'm not a fighter . Boris trotted into the house unconcerned , making a beeline for his water bowl in its frame next to the refrigerator . I went upstairs and checked every room of the house , finding nothing missing or disturbed . To be certain , I opened the floor safe under my bed . Everything I 'd left there was still there , and nothing appeared to have been moved . So why the feeling ? In the business I am in , you learn to trust instincts , and my instinct was that someone had been in my house . I thought it over as I watered plants , sorted through the mail , played back the messages from clients on my answering machine . Arthur , maybe ? Could n't be . He was n't the sharpest pencil in the drawer , but he knew better than to come to my house so soon after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still a bit irritated by the sensation , when I opened the Globe from the day after the job and saw that both guards had survived . This was a relief , both because it meant that if worse came to worst and the police connected me to the job there would be no murder charge and because I am a peaceable man by nature and my guilt would have been a terrible thing if either of the guards had died . In the next day 's Globe I saw that one Arthur Czyz , 39 , of Malden , had been found dead in his apartment of a gunshot wound . There were no details , but I assumed the police had found the money from the robbery and were waiting to dot their i 's and cross their t 's before making an announcement . The next four editions of the Globe , however , contained no such definitive link . Boston police speculated that Arthur had been involved in the job because his wound had clearly been inflicted elsewhere , but they had not recovered the station attendant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the crime . I looked up from the paper when I heard Boris make that mooing sound . He was standing in the living room , staring into the corner behind an end table , against the wall that divided the living room from the kitchen . I called him and he glanced at me , then went back to his study . Borzois , I thought . He was probably hearing mice ; I would have to get traps again . That night I dreamed I was sitting in the living room talking to Arthur , who was reclining on my sofa without the slightest regard for the blood that leaked through his shirt and stained the armrest . " Your dog got me killed , " he said , and I tried to deny it , but I knew he was right . I woke up to the thump of the newspaper on the porch . I was on the sofa , the dream still vivid in my mind . Had I walked in my sleep ? I never had before . But I 'd never had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lingering guilt were troubling me more than I was allowing myself to realize . Boris groaned at the door , then whined at a higher pitch when I was slow to get up . I let him out into my small yard and picked up the paper . Again nothing about the robbery except a small notice that both guards had gone home from the hospital and the state of Maine was talking about improving security at weigh stations . When Boris came back in the house , I said to him , " Arthur says you got him killed . " He looked at me , then went into the corner and stared at the wall . he was still there when the police knocked on the door and arrested me for armed robbery and attempted murder . There is n't much to say about being in prison , although God knows people do say enough about it . My own experience at MCI-Walpole was relatively tranquil ; the highlight , if it can be called that , was a scene in the cafeteria during my fifth year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something and one stabbed the other in the back with a fork . The wounded party leaped away from the table and ran from the cafeteria , fork waggling from just inside his right shoulder blade , and someone shouted out , " Stop that guy ! He 's stealing the silverware ! " I was lucky , no doubt about it . Being older and innocuous , I was n't a threat to anyone , and apart from a few perfunctory assaults soon after I arrived , I passed my six years ( thanks to a skilled attorney ) at Walpole without incident . I read most of what was in the prison library ; I tried to keep tabs on my house , which I 'd rented to a fellow antique dealer burned out of his own home as a result of a fire in the restaurant below his Charles Street condominium , and I made repeated phone calls to my old friend Karen Garrity , who had volunteered to take care of Boris until such time as I could reclaim him . I never found out who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't spend much time looking . Revenge was of no interest to me , perhaps because my sentence was the least I deserved for participating in the robbery and getting a man killed . And whoever had placed me at the scene , I reasoned out of a natural faith in humankind , must have had legitimate reasons of self-preservation . The darkest moment of my Walpole tenure came a year before I was released , when I called Karen to ask about Boris and she told me that he had run away . In disbelief I hung up the phone and cried , only then realizing that he was the only reason I cared about the length of my stay . I was never one of those inmates who loses all sense of the outside world and fears the date of his release , but my guilt over Arthur 's death allowed me to grow comfortable in this punishment of my own choosing . No family awaited me on the outside , and my friendships were all old enough that a length of time apart would do them no lasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decision was made to return me to civil society , and I only wanted to return because I wanted to see my dog . That final year passed in a kind of ennui that surpassed even the typical long-term inmate 's fatalism . At my parole hearing , I said honestly - that I regretted nothing in my life so much as my decision to go along with Arthur Czyz and rob an armored car in Maine . Asked about my plans if I were released , I said - again truthfully - that I would like to rebuild my dormant antiques business . I was fifty-one years old and had luckily not had anything in my home that tied me to any other violations of the law , and the parole board released me two months before my fifty second birthday . Karen was there to pick me up and drive me back to Boston . We talked about highway construction , mostly , and although I wanted to ask her about Boris I could n't bring myself to do it . Of course she 'd done everything she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ borzoi is a sight hound ; put something interesting in his field of vision and he 'll follow it to the next state . They are a valuable breed , too , and I 'd spent a number of sleepless nights in my cell wondering if he 'd been stolen to be sold . Fitting , somehow , that seemed . Cosmically just . My punishment for my own thievery was having the only thing I cared about in the world stolen from me , and I would never know if he had been sold to someone who cared for him or shot and dumped in a river when the thief found that no one would buy him . There was also the real possibility that he had run away , gotten lost , been picked up by Boston animal control officers , and euthanized at the city shelter . Or adopted , perhaps . I chose to believe the latter . Whatever the case , he was gone , and that was as much my fault as the death of Arthur Czyz . Then , as we pulled up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said to me , " Greg , I have something to tell you . " I waited . She shifted in her seat , fiddled with her keys , and finally went on . " I could n't tell you this over the phone , but Boris did n't run away . He died . " " He died ? " I repeated stupidly . " I 'm so sorry , " Karen said . " I just could n't tell you . he had some kind of stroke , the vet thought , and I had to have him put down . he did n't suffer . " " Boris died , " I said softly , more to myself than her , trying the words out on my tongue and reeling as this revelation tore down the barriers of self-serving anguish I 'd been hiding behind for the previous year and more . There was no thief , no cosmic justice . just simple random chance , random as a dog 's bark that nearly kills an armored-car guard in Maine . It is difficult to describe how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No longer did I have the luxury of believing that I was a stone on one pan of some great scale of justice . If Boris had simply died , nine years old with a wandering blood clot , I could believe that I was responsible for myself again . Karen was still apologizing , and I laid a hand on her forearm . " It 's all right , " I said . " Better to know . You have no idea how hard it was to wonder . " As I spoke , I realized how it must have sounded , and I rushed to correct myself . " I 'm not blaming you . I do n't know what I would have done in your shoes . You 're my friend , Karen . I thank you for taking care of Boris at the end of his life . " We made small talk for a moment after that , agreed to meet for lunch once I 'd gotten settled in the house again . Then I got out of the car and walked up my sidewalk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an ashtray on the por-h railing ; I hoped that jules had refrained from smoking in the house . My key fit in the lock , surprising me , and the door opened onto my front hall that looked as it always had save for the coats that were n't mine hanging from the hall pegs . In the living room , my couch and coffee table and mantel ornaments were all exactly as I had left them , and the six years I had been gone fell away from me like a dream . Then I noticed the chessboard in the back corner of the living room , against the wall that separated the living room from the kitchen . Handcarved mahogany stand , squares done in obsidian and white marble , pieces of the same material . Mother-of-pearl border running around the edge of the board . It was the Gronkjaer board . An envelope lay in the center of the board . I opened it and read a note in Karen 's handwriting : Welcome back to the world , Greg . It was the finest gift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was near tears with love and guilt and relief and happiness and grief . I turned to go back to the front door in case Karen had n't already left , and saw a second note on the coffee table . Greg , it said .

Karen told me he ran away , right ? Guess he tried to come home , ! have n't been able to catch him , he always takes off when I go outside , but keep an eye out . I 'm sure that when he sees you he 'll come right back . Jules . You 're always standing on one more rug , and it 's always a surprise when someone pulls it out from under you .

No good reason presented itself , but she had . She must have , unless jules was mistaken and there was another borzoi wandering through the neighborhood ; and given that I 'd seen in the flesh exactly one other borzoi in the three years I 'd owned Boris , this did n't seem likely . So I let it rest , and instead of confronting Karen went out to look for Boris . I papered the neighborhood with flyers featuring a six-yearold photo , drove from Newbury Street along every side street we 'd ever walked on all the way out to the Museum of Fine Arts , sat up nights waiting for the click of his toenails on the porch , but Boris did n't appear . At some point I became convinced that jules was playing a practical joke on me , and I called him up in a fury . he was hurt , with good reason ; jules was n't the kind of guy to be cruel in that way , at least not to his friends . " I understand you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but this is crap . If I did n't think you were having problems adjusting to being outside again , I 'd come over there and kick your ass for you . " This brought me back to Earth , and I apologized. he was mollified . We 'd been friends too long for a single irrational act to drive us apart . He even offered to cut me in on a job he was planning out in Sudbury , but I turned him down . " One time in prison 's enough for me , " I told him . " This is one guy who is rehabilitated . From now on , I 'm an antique dealer . " Which I was , and I took satisfaction from working hard at it and making a legitimate living . I 'd been able to support myself dealing antiques for years , but only because much of what I sold had been acquired through nonstandard channels . Now I restricted myself to reputable auctions and estate sales , not even wanting to go near sources that had a whiff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was up and running again , and had gotten a storefront 's worth of merchandise out of storage and into a tiny space in a coming part of the South End . About this time , two things happened . First , I saw Boris , and second , Kenny Kazlauskas sent someone over to visit me . Boris appeared in the back yard while I was making coffee at about seven one morning . I dropped my mug on the floor and ran out the back door with coffee squishing in my slippers , and my dog came trotting up to me like he 'd just been jaunting around the block for half an hour instead of missing and presumed dead for more than a year . By the time he 'd leaned his narrow head into my crotch like sight hounds always do , I was crying , and I led him back into the house wiping away tears and squishing in my slippers and swearing that I would kill him myself if he ever did anything like that again . Then there was a knock at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bronski . " Greg , " he said . " Mike , " I said . " Mind if I come in ? " " This a social call ? " " Kenny asked me to stop by . " " Then no , I 'd appreciate it if you did n't come in , " I said . " I 'm just out of Walpole , as I 'm sure you know , and I 'm trying to keep my nose clean . " " Far be it from me to dirty your nose , " said Mike . " Kenny just wanted me to drop by , ask if you knew anything about what happened to that money you and Arthur got from the armored-car job . " " Two things , " I said . " One : no , I do n't . I 'm guessing Arthur hid it somewhere before he died . And two : what does Kenny care ? " " Arthur owed Kenny about eighty grand , " Mike said with a shrug . " He figures that in this situation , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nose is so clean you do n't want to have anything to do with the cash anyway . " he looked at me with one of his eyelids lowered just a touch , as if he was gauging the distance between us , and I reminded myself that Mike Bronski had killed six people that I knew of . Most of them had probably seen that look . Kenny K. himself had populated the Mystic River with a number of unfortunate souls who took his money and exhausted his patience . I wondered what Arthur had done to get so indebted to him . That did n't matter at the moment , though . What mattered was that Kenny had decided he was going to get the money from me if he could n't get it from Arthur , and I did n't have it . " I 'll ask around , see what I can find out , " I said . " You do that , " said Mike , still with that heavy-lidded look . I shut the door and turned to see that Boris was gone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kenny K. was n't the kind of guy who was going to change his mind ; if he 'd decided I could tell him where the money was , he 'd keep turning up the heat until I either told him or he vented his frustration and I could n't tell anybody anything ever again . I could n't really afford it , but for all of three seconds I considered taking the direct approach and just spending the money to have someone take Kenny out . It would have to be someone from out of town , since nobody local would want to weather the storm that would follow . I was n't certain I 'd survive the reprisals either , though , and as I 've said , I do n't like violence . Even talking to guys like Kenny or Mike made me want to get my teeth cleaned . So I 'd have to convince him I did n't know where the money was , or I 'd have to find it and give it to him . Convincing did n't seem likely . Neither did finding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ride . The first thing I did was call Karen . She 'd known Arthur longer than I had , and I also wanted to get the Boris thing all the way out into the open . From force of habit , we met at the coffeehouse , which miraculously was still there even after my years in Walpole , and when we 'd gotten seated at an outside table I started right in on her . " Karen , why did you tell me Boris was dead ? " " What ? " she said . " Because he is . " " First you told me he ran away , though . And jules told me he saw Boris in the neighborhood , and you know what ? I saw him yesterday . He came right into the house , but I left the back door open and he took off again . " As I said it , I realized that she would think I was suffering from some kind of grief-induced fantasy - but I had seen Boris , I had felt his head under my hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left the back door open . " Greg , " Karen said slowly . " I know you miss Boris . And I know Walpole was n't easy on you , and you 're still adjusting to being out . And I know I lied to you once about this , but you have to believe me when I tell you that Boris is dead . I was there when the vet put him down . I have the bill . " She was looking hard at me , and I could tell that there was no sense pressing the issue . Time to change the subject . " Thanks for the chessboard , " I said . " I meant to tell you before . " " I wanted you to have something , " she said . " You 've had a rough time , and part of it was my fault . Plus knowing you , I do n't think the board will work its curse on you . " I had to laugh at that . She was right . For one reason or another , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any kind . I had no family , no friends outside business circles , no deep emotional entanglements of any kind . This had never been a conscious choice . I 'd just always been solitary . In the three years I 'd had Boris I 'd become more attached to him than I ever had to any human , but at first I 'd bought him on a whim , after seeing a borzoi running along the Charles River . " Mike Bronski came to see me yesterday , " I said . " Do n't tell me you 're getting back into the business . " " I 'm not . And if I was , I would n't work with Kenny . The drugs and girls thing is outside my area of expertise , you know ? Mike was asking about the money from the armored-car job . " She waited for me to go on . " Kenny thinks I know where it is . I 'm guessing I have maybe a week before he decides to get someone to work on me and find out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , but do you have any idea what Arthur did with the money before he died ? " When I 'd been talking about Boris , Karen had looked confused and sympathetic . Now she was just angry . " I can not believe you 're asking me this , " she said . " Do you - " She broke off and stared away from me at the passing traffic . " Karen , " I said . " You 're my best friend . I do n't think you 're holding anything out on me for yourself . But you knew Arthur better than I did , and if he had someplace where he stashed job proceeds , you 'd know it . If you have your own reasons for not telling me , I respect them ; but I 'm asking you as a friend who is in danger . Kenny K. is going to kill me if I do n't tell him something . That I 'm not making up . " She caught the implication of that last sentence , and she did n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by . Then after a while she said , " If Arthur had to hide something , it would probably be out at his dad 's farm in Fitchburg . " " Thank you , " I said , and meant it . " Does Kenny know about this ? " " I 'm guessing he 's had someone out there looking around , but I have n't talked to Arthur 's dad in years . There 's no reason for him to tell me if anything has happened . " Nothing had . I called Piotr Czyz the next morning , introduced myself as a friend of Arthur 's , and asked if I could come out and speak to him that afternoon . That was fine with him , so after lunch - which I spent looking out the kitchen window for Boris - I drove out of the city through ostentatious suburbs that had been farmland when I 'd gone into Walpole . Something about **29;1992;TOOLONG houses running their sprinkler systems in the rain gets to me , and the drive out Route Two had me in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only begun to nibble at Fitchburg , and by the time I 'd found Sunny Hill Dairy I was enjoying the outing . It occurred to me that I could keep driving , go anywhere , forget about Kenny K. and Arthur and the whole damn sordid business , and for the first time I understood - really understood - that I was a free man again . Well , there was the problem with violating parole . And forgetting the past six years would mean forgetting Boris , and I could n't do that . No human being worth the name would walk away from his dog like that . Even if the dog was supposedly dead . Time to admit something , I told myself as I parked outside the dairy farm 's office and took in a deep manure-scented breath . You do n't believe Boris is dead . And if you do n't believe Boris is dead , either you believe Karen is lying or you believe your dog has come back from the grave . I had touched him . I had brushed his hair from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his son had been , but his bristly farmer 's face was missing Arthur 's blunt malice . When we shook hands , I was briefly ashamed of the softness of my own palm : the guilty side of the Puritan work ethic . I suggested we talk in private , and he led me to his office . As he shut the door he said , " Chess player ? " At first I did n't know what he meant . Then he pointed to my tie , a dark green job with knights and bishops all over it . It 's one of my favorite ties . " Not really , " I said . " Coffeehouse player , maybe . Mostly I just admire the game , and the people who are really good at it . " He nodded , hand still on the doorknob . " The only people who ever wanted to talk to me about Arthur were police and criminals . You are n't police . " Getting right to the point . " I 'm not a criminal anymore either , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me without a trace of sympathy in his eyes . " I wish Arthur had lived to say that , " he said then , and gestured for me to sit . We faced each other across his desk , a painted aluminum rectangle that marked him as a man for whom success did n't mean flash . " I was in on the armored-car job with Arthur , " I said . " And I 'm going to be up front with you and tell you that it might be my fault that he was killed . " I was ready to tell him the whole story , up to and including Boris 's fateful bark , but he cut me short . " It was Arthur 's fault that he was killed . I got old a long time ago waiting for it to happen . " It might have sounded like he was letting me off the hook , but I knew better . What he meant was that I had no business wasting his time with false guilt . This shook me a bit , - Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mourned him ? Or had I only been feeling sorry for myself because his stupid idea had bought me six years in Walpole ? " You 're probably right about that , " I said . " And if I get killed now , it 'll be my fault , but I 'm still trying to avoid it . " " I do n't know where the money is , " Arthur 's father said . I waited . " You 're not the first to ask , and I 'll tell you what I told the other guy . I had n't seen my son for two years before he died , and he had n't been out here for a year before that . And he damn sure could n't have made the drive with a bullet in his lung , and if he had come here with that goddamn money I 'd have told him to burn it or else I would . " A deep flush crept across Piotr Czyz 's face as he spoke , and I knew that whatever he 'd said , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him of how his son had died . I stood . " Mr. Czyz , I 'm trying to stay alive . I do n't mean to throw this in your face . " " I hope you do stay alive , " he said from behind his desk . " But it 's not up to me . " I drove back to Boston wondering what to do next . The dairy had been a long shot , so I was n't really disappointed that it had n't paid off . Still , I now had one less option to avoid Kenny K. 's bone saws , or concrete Keds , or whatever other killing methodologies his Mafia-fevered brain had latched onto . This was trouble . Things only got worse when I walked into my house and found Mike Bronski watching television in the living room . " You are one crazy faggot/ " he said without taking his eyes off the screen , where motorcycles were jumping over piles of dirt . Mike was under the impression that all antiques dealers were homosexual , a stereotype that just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the safe - my one parole violation - but Mike and I both knew that if I took off fast in any direction , he 'd make me wish I had n't . So I stood where I was and said , " What makes me crazy , Mike ? " he shook his head as if I 'd disappointed him . " Are n't you smart enough to know when not to play dumb ? Jesus . " . " Humor me . Why am I crazy ? " " I did n't think you could train those kinds of dogs to attack , " Mike said . " I give you credit for that . What is it , an Afghan ? " " Borzoi . Russian wolfhound . " " Whatever , the goddamn thing was fast . Came right out of Kenny 's hedge when he went out to get the paper this morning . I was just leaving , and wham here comes this white blur out of the hedge . " Mike started to laugh . " Like nothing I ever saw . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its ribs , and then it took off like a track dog . I took a couple of shots at it , but .... " he shrugged . " You know how many broke-down greyhounds I popped in the last ten years ? Every one of them , I wished I could get a nice target rifle , set it up and let that dog run . Okay , dog , you and me . I miss , you 're free . Instead I took " em to the dump , bang , left " em there for the gulls . And now here I am with this Russian dog hauling ass across Kenny 's yard , and all I have is this . " he took a snub-nosed revolver out of his belt and laid it on the coffee table . " Did n't seem right . " he turned the television off and stood . " Some dog you got there , Greg . I admire a good dog . Wanted to tell you this before I pass along a message from Kenny . he called me once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Said you can keep the money if you give him the dog . " On his way past me to the back door , Mike clapped me on the shoulder . " Helluva dog . Truth is , Kenny 's scared shitless of it . Thinks it 's magic , the crazy sonofabitch . One of us 'll be by tomorrow . " After he left , I stood staring blankly at the revolver on the coffee table , trying to make sense of the whole thing . Kenny K. lived in a gaudy neo-Colonial house in Hingham , for God 's sake , a good fifteen miles from my house , and the only thing Boris had ever attacked in his life was a stuffed yak I 'd given him when he was a puppy . Now , at nine years old , he 'd become a pointy-headed assassin ? It was almost easier to believe that he 'd come back from the dead . Completely at sea , I grabbed hold of the one question I knew I could get answered . I called Karen . She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think she almost hung up when I asked her what had happened to Boris 's body . " You ca n't go dig up his grave and see if he 's in it , Greg , " she snapped . " I had the vet take care of it . " The initial deception I could almost understand ; it 's hard to break bad news to people when other things have made them vulnerable . But this hurt . " Do you know what they do with dead dogs ? " I shouted into the receiver . " They pile them in a goddamn dump truck and throw them in a landfill to rot , Karen ! You could n't even spring for the hundred bucks to have him cremated while you were lying to me so I could lie awake in my fucking cell thinking he 'd starved to death in an alley somewhere ? " As I shouted , I noticed that I was looking at the Gronkjaer board , her gift to me in celebration of my release . And just as that registered , I also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was getting late , and I was going to die the next day . That was bad enough , but what I could n't stand was the thought that I might leave this world on bad terms with the human being who meant more to me than any other . The only person for whom my feelings rivaled my love for Boris . That sounds strange and unhealthy , I know , but when it came to relationships I 'd never played my cards very well . I went to Karen 's house , and when she opened the door I said I was sorry before she could shut it again , and then I said that people are not at their best when dangerous mobsters were going to kill them in the morning , and I asked her if I could come in and talk for a while . She let me in , and we sat in a kind of fake companionable silence for a while . She was letting me work myself up to whatever I 'd come to ask , and I knew it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted to ask but not if it was the right question . I had that tense feeling in the back of my mind that something should have been clear to me , that I was seeing things but not the connections between them . Probably just desperation , I thought . Looking for that miraculous way out when of course there was n't one . " Karen , when you told me you had n't talked to Arthur 's father in years , what did that mean , exactly ? " " What are you getting at , Greg ? " You get involved with a woman sometimes , a kind of no-questions-asked relationship . For the comfort . Karen and I had once found that kind of comfort in each other . It lasted about a year , then dried up without either of us feeling aggrieved . She 'd married since then , a couple of years before I 'd gone to Walpole , but some of the closeness we 'd once enjoyed ... that kind of feeling never completely goes away . Unless you push it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ K. had ever done business , I pushed it . Hard . Her face closed up , and I had time to think that she would just get up and leave me sitting there in her living room . She got hold of it , though , whatever she was feeling , and she answered me honestly . " I used to work for Pete . And Pete used to work for Kenny . he still might . I try not to know too much about them anymore . When I still had the market , Pete would drop product with the milk run . It was all Kenny 's - Pete did n't mind moving it , but he did n't want to get involved with buying and selling . Arthur came in every day to pick it up and move it into the neighborhood . he was still close to his father then , but when he started to munch some of the product Pete threatened to cut him out . So Kenny picked him up , got him started collecting from the pony junkies Kenny made book for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't want his boy getting dirty for Kenny K. , but by then Arthur had a habit and the upshot of the whole thing is that Arthur and Pete stopped talking to each other . And Arthur started to like the horses a bit himself . Kenny really owned him after that . " A little while after that I sold the market to Kenny , and then I got married , and now I do n't have anything to do with it anymore . " I remembered when she 'd sold the market . The lease on the building had gone way up as Central Square turned hip , and she 'd wanted to put her money somewhere easier and cleaner . So she 'd told me at the time . And it had been true , but there was a lot she had n't told me too . I could feel that omission , like a wedge of regret and stubbornness driven between us . Working it over in my head , I decided that Pete Czyz had told me the truth when he denied knowing where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though , and now I had that tense feeling in my mind again , like I should have been able to put together what he 'd left out . Karen quit talking once she 'd spun the story out for me , and I could tell she wanted me to leave . On the way home I tried to put it all together , but I kept running aground on the fact that Kenny K. was coming by the next morning and I had nothing to tell him . Add that to the fact that I had possibly endangered Karen by going to see her when Kenny might well have someone keeping an eye on me , and I walked in the front door of my house feeling very much like a man waiting for the noose at sunrise , hoping only that I did n't take any of my friends with me . Boris was in the living room staring at the Gronkjaer board . It made a kind of sense , insofar as seeing your dead dog in the living room can make sense . When Karen had bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's favorite corner , the one he 'd always stared into . I do n't know if other dogs do this , but Boris had a habit of staring for long periods of time into particular corners , ears at half-mast and head cocked slightly to one side . I used to joke that he was seeing a ghost , but stopped when a client took me a little too seriously . One of the hazards of the business when you deal with items that people think might be magical . So if Boris was going to come back and stare into a corner , it would be that corner . " Hey , " I said . " You let yourself in ? " He glanced up at me , swept his tail back and forth a couple of times , then returned to his study of the board . It was set up in one of my favorite positions , the ending of Aron Nimzovich 's 1923 Immortal Zugzwang . A classic game , one of the great moments in chess history ; with only one real attacking exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until his opponent Smisch had no move that would n't cut his own throat . That 's what Zugzwang means . I 'd always admired this game more than any of the other famous matches , the ones awarded brilliancy prizes at one tournament or another ; there was something supremely satisfying about the way Nimzovich inexorably forced Smisch to do himself in by allowing him moves that looked perfect but were in fact suicide . Victory through guile rather than brute force . The kind of achievement that appeals to a peaceable man . Of course , I found myself in Samisch 's exact predicament . I could n't find the money , and I was n't about to give Boris up - even if I could have - so every avenue led to me being found dead by a friend once someone noticed that my mailbox was overflowing . I might have run , I guess , but Keniiy was rich and Kenny was mean and Kenny was obsessive and in the end he would have found me , I think . Also , I did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could no more imagine a life working in a hotel in Paraguay than I could imagine taking a gun and killing Kenny myself . There are people who say that anyone will kill given the right situation ; I do n't think this is true . If I had been able to kill Kenny , I would n't have been me . Ergo , I was n't able to kill Kenny . What I was able to do was pull a chair up next to Boris and the chessboard and sit , quietly , as the Sun went down and the room darkened around me . Sometime after dark he turned around three times and lay on the rug next to my chair , and in the room 's perfect stillness I felt myself receding . Tomorrow I would die , and one by one all of the things that had occupied my time grew insubstantial and finally disappeared . I sat , alone , with Boris sleeping on the rug and the faint glow of streetlights picking out the crosses on the two kings " heads . The phone woke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm supposed to come over if you have the dog . " " What , is he scared of a borzoi ? " Mike laughed . For the first time in our short and unwilling interaction , I felt like he did n't think I was a total loss . " I do n't have the dog , " I said . He did n't ask whether I had the money . " Okay , Kenny 'll be there in an hour . " The phone went dead , and I put my hand down at the side of the chair . Boris was gone . An hour . I decided I would die clean , and went upstairs to take a shower . Thirteen minutes , including getting dressed again in my favorite corduroys and a sweater I 'd had for thirty years . I spent three minutes thinking about whether I should leave some kind of note for Karen . I was leaving the house to her . She would n't move into it , would in fact sell it as soon as my will cleared probate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I decided ; no note . Everyone who knew me would eventually find out what had happened . I did n't care . The truth of that struck me . I did n't care . I did n't care that Kenny Kazlauskas was at that moment on his way over to my house to kill me because I did n't know where Arthur had hidden the money . Why ? Because I was helpless . Without options or avenues of escape . Kenny was coming over because that 's the kind of person Kenny was , and I 'd let him do it . I 'd let him walk right into my house . I. Would . Let . Him . " Jesus , " I whispered , and understood everything . Sometimes you think you 're playing white , and it turns out you 've just been seeing the board from the wrong angle . THE GRONKJAER BOARD was heavy , but it scooted across the rug without any of the pieces falling over . For some reason that seemed important . When I 'd gotten it far enough out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I looked for a long moment at the painted-over cover of the milk chute set into the wall . Arthur had spent his entire working life driving a delivery truck for his father 's dairy ; where else would he have stashed the money if he wanted me to find it ? I could n't pry the door open with my hands , so I got a screwdriver from the junk drawer in the kitchen and gouged the paint out of the hinges , then worked the tip under the edge of the door and popped it loose . When it opened , bundles of money fell out onto the floor . Arthur , you were a better guy than I ever gave you credit for , I thought , and was humbled even as pure exaltation swept through me at the realization that I was going to live . Kenny would show up , I 'd give him the money , and we 'd all forget about the whole thing . The scope of my life , just then constricted to a few minutes , suddenly ballooned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old ! Most of the bundles of cash stayed jammed in the chute until I scooped them out . By the time I 'd cleared the space , the pile was heaped around my feet and I felt like Scrooge McDuck . A small piece of white paper fluttered out of the chute to land on the mound of bills . It was a note . G , it read . Your dog got me shot , but I do n't blame him . If I was a dog I would of barked too . see ya after I get doctored up . There was no signature . My throat felt tight and the wash of conflicting emotion brought me to the edge of tears . It 's hard to realize that you 've been so wrong about someone who 's dead ; how do you make it right ? Kenny walked in the front door without knocking . he shut the door behind him and stepped into the living room , not showing a gun yet . " Let 's have it , " he said . A double arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of his nose . There were more in his ear , and I could see the edge of a bandage sticking out past his shirt cuff . I resisted the urge to comment . It was one thing to be utterly stoned on the knowledge that I 'd just been given a cosmic get-out-of-jail-free card , whether through plain magic or just the odd swirls of probability that always cropped up whenever large amounts of money were dislocated from their proper flow , it was another thing entirely to mock a mari who would be looking for an excuse to kill me whether I had what he wanted or not . And Kenny was not at his most agreeable : his pupils were contracted to pinpricks , his hands shook , he was blazing with cocaine and scared to death . I 'd taken a couple of steps out into the room as Kenny came in . My chair and the Gronkjaer board blocked his view of the corner , and I took care to stand in the gap between them . " You tipped the cops to me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He grinned . " Fuckin " A right , I did . I got a right to find out where my money was , and you could n't work no voodoo bullshit on me from Walpole . It did n't work , hey , if at first you do n't succeed , you know ? " His eyes were snapping all over the room . " So let 's have it . You do n't have it , you know what ? They used to press people under stones until they admitted they were witches . I got a big pile of rocks out at a quarry in Stow . You give me the money , they get broken up into road gravel . " " I got it , " I said , and gestured behind me . The table was n't quite where I thought it was , I guess , or something else was going on , but as I moved my arm , the side of my hand brushed the white king where he stood cornered on hi . The king toppled , bouncing on the edge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boris came out from behind me , head low and upper lip curled back from his teeth . I 'd say that I was as surprised as Kenny , but it would be a lie . His face actually went white , instantly , as if the blood had been vacuumed from his body , and when his mouth fell open a kind of whine came out . Reflexively he reached for the gun in his waistband , but before he could get it out Boris sprang . A borzoi is a large dog , but he seems larger than he is . Boris stood about even with my hips , and when he stood on his hind legs he could rest his front paws on my shoulders , but the most he ever weighed was about eighty-five pounds . Every ounce of that is muscle , though , and centuries of breeding for the hunting of wolves has made borzois whip-fast and amazingly agile . Boris caught Kenny just as Kenny 's hand found the doorknob , and if the door had n't come open I ca n't help but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . well , dead as Boris , right there on my living room rug . But the door did come open , and Kenny threw Boris off long enough to get out of the house , breaking the screen door off its latch as he went . Boris followed him , and as I ran after the two of them I heard Kenny 's screams trailing away down the street . When I got out onto the porch they were out of sight . I looked up and down the block , saw no ectoplasmic borzoi and no panicked gangster . Not even an astonished neighbor to make me believe that what I 'd just seen was real . Kenny 's Eldorado sat parked in my driveway and I was seized by an irrational certainty that some kind of error had been purged and made right again . The Gronkjaer board , I thought . The one who loved you , and whom you abandoned . The next morning , bright and early , there came a knock at the door . I was delighted to see that my visitors did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cops and therefore unwelcome . " Brower and Glenn , " I said . " Come in . " They did , and sat . We 'd known each other in a professional capacity for six years or so - they were the detectives who 'd put me in Walpole . My natural instincts tend toward courtesy , but I knew from prior experience that it would be wasted on these two . They were both colorless and patient men , ill at ease when they were n't working or talking about work . So I got things started . " Yes , that 's Kenny K. 's Eldorado in my driveway , " I said . " Oh good , " Brower said . " He 's being forthcoming . " Glenn chimed in . " Kenny says you sicced your dog on him . Twice . Most recently yesterday . " " Detectives , you know Kenny is n't a rational man . " " Did you sic your dog on him ? " " My dog is dead , " I said , and believed it - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He died about a year ago . " Back to Brower . " Do we have to take your word for that ? " " I can get you the receipt from the vet . It has the word euthanasia on it , if that 's specific enough for you . " " So we found Kenny around the corner , practically catatonic and dog bites all over him , and you do n't know anything about that , " Brower said . " Even though his car is in your driveway , " added Glenn . " Did Kenny tell you why he was here ? " I asked . It was a weak effort , not even enough to get Brower to crack a smile . " Why do n't you tell us ? " he responded . " He said my dog had attacked him at his house in Hingham , " I began . " Which is , as I 'm sure you know , a damned long way for a nine-year-old borzoi to go just to bite someone , apart from the fact that Boris was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life depended on it , and had never been to Kenny 's house before . " I paused , hoping the ridiculousness of the whole situation would impress itself upon them . " Plus , as I mentioned , Boris is dead . Maybe some dog did bite Kenny ; his face was stitched up when he came here . he said he was going to kill me if I did n't give him both the dog and the money from the LockTrans job . " Glenn arched an eyebrow . " And you said ? " " I do n't have my dog anymore , and I do n't have the money either . " This was true . There 's a no-kill animal shelter in the South End that has a 24-hour lobby full of cages where you can drop off strays . I 'd gone there the night before and stuffed an old nylon duffel bag full of the LockTrans proceeds into one of the cages . A mournful beagle mutt had licked my fingers through the wires of his own prison . If he had n't been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't have the money , " Glenn repeated . " Whatever Arthur did with it , it 's gone . " " So why did Kenny think you had it ? " Brower again . I shrugged . " Who knows why Kenny thinks anything ? Come on , Detective , Kenny 's got a thousand-dollar-a-day habit and he 's been convinced for fifteen years that I 'm some kind of sorcerer . Did he tell you that ? " They were n't ready to let it go , I could see that . After a short pause , during which I assumed they were telepathically arranging who would speak next , Brower said , " Sure , Kenny 's delusional , and the coke ate through his septum into his brain in about 1987 . But he keeps good track of his money . " " If he thinks this money is his , " I said , " it 's because he put Arthur up to the job . " Brower and Glenn looked at each other . " You remember Greg here saying this at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think so . Greg , did you forget to mention this at your trial ? " I kept my mouth shut . They were n't done squeezing , and I was n't going to waste my one bullet until they were . " We know Kenny put the bug in Arthur 's ear , " Glenn said . " And we all know that it was n't going to stick with just your testimony anyway . So what we 're wondering is , is there anybody else you might have just remembered was involved ? " I took a deep breath . I only had one thing to give them , and I was n't sure it would be enough , and down in the pit of my stomach where the old criminal me still lived I felt the rolling uneasiness of the snitch who knows he 's going to turn and ca n't do anything about it . It 's a kind of guilt unlike any other . " You 're not going to hear me say anything about Piotr Czyz , " I said . Detectives Brower and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their heads until they 'd satisfied themselves that I 'd really said what they thought I 'd said . Both of them stood . I stood with them . " I want to be out of this . As of now . Forever . " " Far as we 're concerned , " said Brower . Glenn nodded . They shut the door behind them when they left . I could have left Piotr out of it . He 'd lost his son , after all . Thing was , though , that when he 'd told me Arthur was responsible for his own death , it was a cheat . And it almost worked ; I was so dumbly grateful for absolution that it almost did n't occur to me that Pete Czyz might have been working that gratitude to steer me away from himself . That was part of what I 'd figured out as I stood there looking at the chessboard waiting for Kenny to show up and end my life . I had helped to kill Arthur , and Kenny Kazlauskas had helped to kill Arthur @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Piotr Czyz had set his son on that road the first time he 'd had Arthur load cottage-cheese tubs filled with cocaine into the GMC TopKick Arthur drove around metro Boston . Somebody 's always to blame . Still , I could have kept my mouth shut . Who was I to judge the truth of Pete Czyz 's grief ? I learned loyalty late in life . It 's not a lesson that comes easily to a thief . I 'd meant it when I told Pete Czyz that I was n't a criminal anymore , and that was why I could n't let Pete walk away from the setup that had killed his son . Arthur Czyz had n't been the best of friends , but in the end he was loyal . For a human being , that 's not too bad . IT COMING ATTRACTIONS THE CRUELEST MONTH ? Ha !
