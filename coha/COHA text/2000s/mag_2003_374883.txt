As war began last week , the American army in Kuwait received a remarkable order from the brass : stow your flags . The fearsome steel coil of tanks and artillery and Bradley fighting vehicles was told to enter enemy territory humbly , stripped of all banners , including the Stars and Stripes . This seemed slightly un-American  --  we 're flag crazed to the point of silliness  --  and entirely appropriate ; liberation , not conquest , was the stated purpose of the war . And so , when the Marines captured their first town , Umm Qasr , and the American flag was reflexively raised in triumph , it was quickly hauled down . In the early hours of Operation Iraqi Freedom , its diplomacy was as stunning as its precision : from the reluctance to use maximum force for the first few nights to the patient efforts to secure a mass surrender to the decision  --  even after the awesome bombing began  --  to leave the electricity in Baghdad untouched and the public infrastructure intact . Donald Rumsfeld at war seems far more tactful than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restraint suggests a question : How will America face the post-Saddam world  --  brazenly , with Old Glory flying , or with quiet authority ? Will it be hubris or humility ? Humility was , of course , George W. Bush 's campaign promise . " If we 're an arrogant nation , they 'll resent us , " he said in his second presidential debate against Al Gore in 2000 . " If we 're a humble nation but strong , they 'll welcome us . " <P> That sounded just right . ( " I agree with that . I agree with that , " was Gore 's response . ) But humility was lost in the anger , dust and blood of Sept. 11 ; it will be nearly impossible to recover when victory is won in Iraq . Hubris could easily masquerade as reality . We are incomparably strong and admirably free , the most benign superpower in history . But the truths inherent in that proposition could easily lead to a falsehood  --  that we are justified in remaking the world as we choose . Certainly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had certain strategies and policies and institutions that were built to deal with the conflicts of the 20th century , " Vice President Dick Cheney said recently . " They might not be the right strategies and policies and institutions to deal with the threat we face now . " <P> The old order did not distinguish itself in the run-up to Iraq . The French preened for the pacifist European street . Hans Blix 's inspection regime was n't nearly as muscular as it needed to be . NATO fiddled ; the U.N . failed . Reality dictates that changes will come . At the very least , American forces  --  an inexact but not insignificant barometer of American interests  --  will be drawn down in Western Europe and moved east to friendlier ( and less expensive ) billets like Hungary . But a more important transition is imminent as Asia supplants Europe as the focus of American foreign policy . This may well lead to new alliances , institutions and military arrangements .                 @ @ @ @
