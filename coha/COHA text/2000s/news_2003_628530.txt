<p> OLYMPIA FIELDS , Ill. - If there is an outbreak of rioting in the streets , panic among television network executives and despair at PGA Tour headquarters , then do n't blame Tiger Woods . <p> The Sultan of Swoosh is doing everything in his power to calm the masses . Despite whatever evidence , hearsay or scuttlebutt may be out there , Woods insists there is no cause for alarm . Woods would like to offer emphatic assurances of no impending seismic shift in the golf world . <p> The holy gospel , according to Woods , is this : <p> He does not tee off today at the 103rd U.S. Open at Olympia Fields Country Club in the midst of a slump . <p> He has never had any personal relationship with a slump . <p> He has no intention of keeping company with a slump in the future . <p> " I do n't think I 've ever been in a slump , no , " Woods said . " I think my overall career has been pretty good . Ever since I came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 've had a pretty good career . " <p> It 's as if Woods emerged from a womb with a view , emboldened by a vision of becoming the best golfer who ever lived . His golfing prowess got him on The Mike Douglas Show , keeping company with Bob Hope , at age 2 . Woods already has the career Grand Slam on his resume at 27 , and he is the defending Open champion . <p> " Honestly , I think I 've had some success , " Woods said , " but sometimes all of you can be a bit dramatic in your writing styles - very flowery at times . I 've hit some good shots , but they have n't been that good . And then I 've hit some bad shots , and they have n't been that bad . " <p> At his best , Woods has created a new world order in golf . He is on the fast track to eclipsing the Golden Bear standard set by Jack Nicklaus , who won a record 18 major championships . Woods has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He holds or shares the scoring record - relative to par - at the Masters , U.S. Open , British Open and PGA Championship . He already has as many majors on the mantel as Nicklaus did at 30 . <p> The price that Woods has to pay for his less-than-benevolent reign over the PGA Tour is relatively small , given the fact his $ 36 million in career prize money is dwarfed by his endorsement income : People expect more of the same , again and again and again . When Woods enters the Open without a victory in nearly three months , the world wants to know what is wrong . <p> Never mind that Woods has won three tournaments in seven starts this year , with arthroscopic knee surgery barely in the rear-view mirror . Never mind that Woods - playing a cautious schedule designed to keep his knee out of harm 's way until his recovery is complete - has as many victories this year as Sergio Garcia does in 77 career starts on the PGA Tour . <p> " I hope Tiger plays well forever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nick Price , who collected all three of his major championships before Woods turned pro near the end of the 1996 season . " We 've got some great players , but we all know Tiger is the one who brings the fans here . He needs to keep doing what he 's doing . He sets a good example for all the young kids . " <p> The ledger over the past 14 majors is Tiger 7 , Everyone Else 7 . Seven different players have accounted for those seven victories : Vijay Singh , Retief Goosen , David Duval , David Toms , Ernie Els , Rich Beem and Mike Weir . Woods has finished 28th , second and 15th in his past three majors , though . If Woods fails to defend his Open championship , it will be the first time this millennium that he is not the reigning champion in any of the majors . <p> " I think that tells you how tough it is to win a major , " said Els , who has won the U.S Open twice and the British Open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it your way . You 're going to have players playing better than you at times . That 's just the way it is . <p> " When your time is right , you 've got to grab it . But still , to be 27 years old and have eight majors is quite incredible . " <p> Keep in mind , Woods decided to make some changes to his swing after he won his first major . At 21 . At Augusta National . By 12 shots . Woods fell from first on the money list in 1997 to fourth the next year . He won only once in 1998 , and it was n't a major . As soon as the swing changes took hold , as soon as Woods began to dial in the distance control of his irons , the world was his again . He has won 30 tournaments in 85 starts since the beginning of 1999 . <p> " I did n't take that drastic a step , " Woods said . " I went piece by piece . I still wanted to be able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as much because of the things I 'm working on . The whole game plan was to be more consistent . Ultimately , that will lead to victories down the road . And my game plan came out perfect . " <p> About the only imperfection , really , has been the left knee that caused Woods to hobble through last year . Though Woods won the Masters , won the Open wire-to-wire , won three other times , he decided he could n't go on that way . The knee surgery forced Woods to wait until the sixth tournament of the season , the Buick Invitational , to make his debut . <p> He won . <p> He won again two tournaments later at the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship . He won again less than a month later - by 11 shots , no less - at the Bay Hill Invitational . <p> He has n't won since . <p> A 15th-place finish at the Masters was his lowest at Augusta since 1999 . A 29th-place finish last month at the Deutsche Bank-SAP opened even more eyes . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States that Woods failed to finish in the top 10 . Woods rallied to finish in a tie for fourth in his final tune-up for the Open tune-up , the Memorial Tournament . He shot 65 in the final round . <p> " My game is pretty good , I think , " Woods said . " I hit the ball really well in Germany . I did n't make any putts . If you saw the greens , you 'd understand . And then at Memorial , I hit the ball just good and the greens were perfect , and I made some putts . " <p> By any measure , though , his ball striking has not been up to his exacting standards . Ranked sixth in average driving distance in 2002 , Woods is 34th this year . He has fallen from 11th to 39th in total driving , from first to 39th in greens in regulation . Still , none of the statistical slippage has stopped Woods from leading the tour in scoring average ( 68.44 ) . <p> " If you can just win one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Woods said . " And that 's always been my goal . And that 's my goal this week . " <p> His definition of a slump ? <p> " I guess , " Woods said , " when you completely lose your game . " <p> The Sultan of Swoosh is trying mightily to calm the masses , to assure them that the world as they know it remains safely intact . He offers emphatic assurances he is working diligently to uphold truth , justice and the Tiger way . <p> " Beware of the wounded leopard , " Price said . " Or Tiger .
