" Life is difficult , " wrote M. Scott Peck , M.D. , in The Road Less Traveled in 1978-a lifechanging work and one of the best-selling books of all time . Here , he discusses his spirituality and attempts to reconcile it with his un-Godly behavior and faith-free profession . Photograph Photograph // Scott Peck has a stationwagon with plates that read " THLOST " in his driveway . They speak of his lifelong journey as a self-described mystic . He is currently working on his last book , a memoir now titled Glimpses of Satan . He says it 's his last effort because his affliction with Parkinson 's disease has slowed him down . Recently , Psychology Today editor in chief Robert Epstein visited him at his home on Lake Waramaug , in Connecticut . Robert Epstein : Most people struggle with issues of spirituality in one form or another Sometimes they arrive at a place of peace , and sometimes they do n't . Must we go through this struggle , or can you point us to a shortcut ? M. Scott Peck : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But to probably at least half of the people , it never seems to enter their minds that they might be engaged in a struggle or that there might be something to struggle with . One of my shticks is about why we need to do hard scientific research on religion . A study shows that if you ask people whether they believe in God , probably 95 percent of Americans will say they do . And there is nothing particularly great about their mental health . But if you ask them whether they have ever had any personal experience with God , only about 15 to 20 percent will say " yes . " Those few have also been judged as more mentally healthy than the others . And the experience is not necessarily one we choose . Everyone is different , so your spirituality is not going to be my spirituality ; your wrestling match is not my wrestling match . But right off the bat , the wrestling match has been a gift of God to you . In the 1970s , when you wrote The Road Less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was raised in a profoundly secular home , I had a belief , an awareness of God , from as far back as I can remember . In poetic form , there is a footnote in The Road Less Traveled about my earliest memory : " In the autumn , when I was three , my mother woke me from dark sleep to see the northern lights dancing in the cold . In her warm night arms , I danced all the way to China before she carried me in . I still dance , and I do not know if I can ever forgive her for such love . " That is quite a first memory . I credit my mother with that , rather than credit God . In my senior year at Friends Seminary , a little Quaker school on the edge of Greenwich Village in New York City , I took an elective course in world religions . The book we used was very objective , and it contained quotes from the Upanishads and Zen Buddhism . It was n't that these religions taught me mysticism , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , I had a religious identity . I had come home . And so I called myself a Zen Buddhist at the age of 18 . Around age 30 I found myself thirsting for a less abstract religion . I 'd always been into Jewish mystical stories , Hasidic stories . Then I discovered Sufism . All Sufi stories are about psychotherapy and teaching and learning . So I started being nurtured by the Muslim mystics ; they were a little more down-to-earth . I 'd turned down a lucrative Harvard fellowship and stayed in the Army as a psychiatrist . Together with a senator 's aide , we toured the new drug-abuse programs to get a feeling for how they Were doing . One of the places we went was Fort Jackson in South Carolina . When we got there , everyone wanted to see this controversial new show coming to town called Jesus Christ Superstar . That show was a real eye-opener . It was the first thing that put me in touch with Jesus ' humanity and realness . The other major thing was reading the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at night reading the New Testament . And just as I had felt , With Jesus Christ Superstar , I was blown away . Now I think a small part of the Gospels is made up . But I found this incredibly real person . Jesus was lonely and sorrowful and scared-an unbelievably real person . And it was at that point that I began to take becoming a Christian seriously . Some people who arrive at Christianity start with Jesus ' divinity , and some with his humanity . With me , it was his humanity . And only later did I begin to get in touch with his divinity , which was initially difficult for me to swallow . This whole time , you were a practicing psychiatrist . You were in a community of confident mainstream mental health and medical professionals , many of whom had research backgrounds . How were you reconciling your spirituality with what you did for a living , namely practicing psychiatry , where there is little or no religious orientation ? Well , when I began to practice psychiatry it was 1964 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I could not talk about it fluently the way I do today . But I already saw no great difference between the psyche and spirituality . To amass knowledge without becoming wise is not my idea of progress in therapy . As soon as I became comfortable doing so , therapy became for me a quasi-spiritual endeavor . And , often with trepidation , I would carefully use certain religious concepts in therapy when appropriate . For example , take people with phobias . Two things characterize them . One is that they see this world as a very dangerous place . The other is that they see themselves as isolated in this dangerous world . So it is up to them , by their wits alone , to keep themselves alive . You usually treat them by converting them to adopt a more benign view of the world as a less dangerous place , or by persuading them that there is something called grace protecting them so they do n't have to worry about everything all the time . You must have had some serious doubts . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stages of faith development . I simplify them a bit . Jim 's theory has six stages ; mine has four . The fundamental stage , one I call " chaotic antisocial , " is a stage of absent spirituality . The second stage is " formal institutional , " in which the fundamentalists fall . Stage three I call " skeptic individual , " where religion is either thrown out or seriously doubted . And then there is stage four , which I call " mystical communal . " To get from stage two to stage four-if you can in a lifetime-you must go through stage three . You have to go through a phase of doubting . One of the great sins of the Christian church is the discouragement of doubting . There 's a limit to doubting . If you become really good at stage-three doubting , you begin to doubt your own doubts . And that 's when you begin to move to stage four . Most people achieve this without being in therapy . Right . But therapy can-although not very well without the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are trained in psychology and psychiatry keep religion at arm 's length . In The Road Less Traveled you wrote , " My plea would be that psychotherapists of all kinds should push themselves to become no less involved but rather more sophisticated in religious matters than they currently are . " That philosophy contradicts the training that 's provided in the field . Even mental health professionals with strong religious beliefs do n't bring them into the therapeutic exchange . You 're saying this is wrong ? Yes . I said it was wrong 20 years ago , and I say it 's wrong today . In 1992 , the American Psychiatric Association , for political reasons , decided it needed to give me recognition because people were getting pissed off at the APA for not giving me any . So the APA gave me a plaque that read , " For his work as a teacher and clinician . " I also gave a lecture . As did William Styron , the author of Sophie 's Choice , who wrote a book about his own depression . The best-attended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they started off with a room that seated 500 . Then they removed a wall to expand the room and got 1,000 people in . Then 200 or 300 more came in , and then there were about 200 or 300 outside . At the end , there was a standing ovation . Photograph // I wrote to the president of the APA and said , " We 've got to do more , and I am here to consult with you in any way you might like . " And he said , " Yes , we have to do more . " I never heard back from him . There are lots of reasons for this state of affairs historically , going back to Galileo , with the fight between science and religion . And psychiatry really does begin with Freud , who was extremely secular and scientific  --  minded . He was terribly conflicted about religion , as many . people are . Of course , most people are familiar with stage-two religion . And by God , we 're going to keep psychiatry scientific . And then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the medical model for insurance purposes . Thank God I 've been out of practice for 15 years now . There are a lot of reasons for this split . But that does n't mean it 's right , or it 's real . . There 's some irony here . They flock to you because of your spirituality , and then spurn you for the same reasons . Another irony is that your books sell well in the Bible Belt . And yet , you are down on fundamentalism , and the fundamentalist Christians are very down on you . They picketed me twice some years ago as me being the Antichrist . Not an antichrist , but the Antichrist . That 's power . Can you tell me more about the roots of your spirituality  --  about the intellectual and experiential side ? All my work can be traced back to my Harvard college thesis , " Anxiety , Modern Science and the Epistemological Problem . " I outlined three basic ways to try and look at things . They can be looked at as if they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something internal , or they were caused by relationships between things . Unfortunately , none of these three ways can answer all the questions we have . That is , our questions about the cause for intellectual anxiety . Increasingly , modern science is about our realization that we just do n't know . Much of my life since has consisted of working out that thesis . The answer to understanding things is not one of those three , but all of them simultaneously . It 's more than a paradox-it 's a " triadox . " I am really an empiricist , a believer in the importance of experience . I 've had all kinds of experiences with God in terms of revelation through a still , small voice or dreams or coincidences . Hundreds of them . Once , a secular Jewish woman wrote a negative review of me in The New York Times , ending it with the comment that unfortunately , most of us do n't have a direct phone line to God . I wrote her back and said , " You know , please do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of times I ca n't get ahold of God , and sometimes the phone rings and I forget to answer . So I suspect there are a lot of people who deliberately leave the phone off the hook because they have these same experiences and they just do n't recognize them as the miracles that they are . " I can remember years ago sitting on my bed and suddenly thinking , " I am God . " And my next thought was that I better not go down to New Milford , Connecticut , and start talking to people about this . On further contemplation , I realized that , to a significant degree , it was my responsibility to decide who God was . And that , in some ways , made me God 's creator . It was at that point that I began to feel sorry for God . I mean , think of the burdens that God shoulders with unfailing gaiety . That was the real beginning of my personal relationship with Him or Her . When I realized that we are " co-creators , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Traveled , you present us with an outrageous challenge : " God wants us to become himself or herself or itself . We are growing toward Godhood . God is the goal of evolution . " That idea has been recognized for ages . Unification with God is the goal of contemplatives .
