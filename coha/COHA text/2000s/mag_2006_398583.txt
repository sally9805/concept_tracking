Allstate has prospered by jettisoning moneylosers . That group includes people who live too close to the water <p> Last year the gulf coast got buffeted by a near-biblical onslaught of evil weather . And although 2006 has proved thus far to be calm , meteorology savants say we 're just in a hiatus during a possible decades-long bout of Atlantic hurricanes . Bad news for vendors of homeowner 's insurance . <p> The problem with claims is that you need premium income to cover them  --  but policyholders do not like a rate increase and neither do the politicians they send to the state legislature . Property/casualty insurers like Allstate ( motto : " You 're in good hands " ) are doing the best they can in this charged atmosphere . Nevertheless , Allstate is cutting back home coverage in Florida and up the eastern seaboard and raising premiums for the remaining policyholders there . This retreat is only the latest cost-cutting move by Allstate , the nation 's second-largest shareholder-owned property/casualty carrier  --  after American International Group ; mutually owned State Farm is the biggest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most non-North American insurance business and converted employee-agents into independent contractors responsible for their own benefits . <p> Under Chief Executive Edward Liddy , 60 , and his number two , Thomas J. Wilson , 49 , the refocusing has worked and the company has prospered . Since Liddy took over in January 1999 Allstate shares are up 55% , versus 11% for the S &P; 500 . Still , Wall Street remains worried that many Hurricane Katrinas lie ahead . Allstate trades at 1.9 times book value , compared with 3 times book for Progressive Corp. , its closest publicly traded competitor . Allstate stock is a mere 8 times trailing earnings , versus 12 for Progressive , which covers only autos and hence is far less threatened by storm losses . <p> Allstate 's net income slipped 44% last year because of heavy hurricane-related outlays ; 2005 's third quarter was the company 's second red-ink period in its history . The company paid out $5.7 billion in claims for Katrina and other storms , and now is paying much more for reinsurance , a sort of insurance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2006 : Earnings are up fivefold to $3.8 billion through Sept. 30 on a premium volume ( net of reinsurance ) of $21 billion , up 1% . <p> Covering 35 million policyholders and 17 million households , the Northbrook , Ill. - headquartered insurance titan is a huge presence . Liddy and Wilson talk about how promptly and deftly the massive Allstate responded to catastrophe claims in the wake of Katrina and the other storms . But they are quick to point out that they run a business that seeks a profit . Indeed , no one should confuse Allstate with the Sisters of Mercy . In Florida Allstate decided not to renew 95,000 home and condominium insurance policies . At the same time , Allstate stopped selling commercial insurance policies to small businesses in Florida and did n't renew another 16,000 Sunshine State policies it had in force . " We just did n't make any money there , " Liddy says , shrugging his shoulders . <p> As harsh as this sounds , he has a point . The decision to drastically cut back in Florida came after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wiping out all the profits earned by Allstate in the state since Hurricane Andrew in 1992 . Likewise , Hurricane Andrew losses destroyed the profits the company garnered there prior to 1992 . In other words , the company has not earned a dime in Florida since it started selling insurance there in the mid-1930s . " In states like Florida , you ca n't charge enough to make money or get an acceptable return on capital , " says Brian Meredith , senior property/casualty insurance analyst at UBS Securities . <p> Earlier this year Allstate announced it will not sell new homeowner policies in the coastal counties of Mississippi and Louisiana . The company also said it wanted to drop wind and hail coverage for 30,000 homeowner policyholders in 18 Louisiana parishes . In January Allstate stopped issuing new homeowner policies in parts of New York including Long Island , New York City and southern Westchester County . The decision does n't affect existing homeowner policies and Allstate will continue to issue new coverage for apartment owners and renters . <p> After Katrina , Allstate and other insurers refused @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The policies excluded floods . Many homeowners did n't buy coverage available from the federal government . <p> Unsurprisingly , the exit from unprofitable markets prompted a lot of anger . People must now scramble for coverage from smaller carriers at much higher rates , if they can get coverage at all . The Mississippi attorney general and irate flood victims have sued Allstate and its peers in a bid to force payments for the water damage . " The flood exclusion was heavily advertised , " Watson insists . Early signs show the insurers have the edge : A Mississippi judge ruled in August in favor of Nationwide Mutual 's refusal to pay a flood claim . <p> James Donelon , Louisiana 's commissioner of insurance , calls Allstate 's cutback plan illegal and vows to fight it in court if necessary . In July Allstate lashed back by threatening to exit the Louisiana homeowner 's insurance market altogether if regulators block its plan to drop wind and hail coverage . <p> More problematic is Allstate 's retreat in New York , where hurricanes seldom strike . U.S. Senator Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurricane risk . " He demanded the company reverse itself and begin writing new coverage without a premium hike . " Allstate is the poster child for terrible corporate citizenship , " says Schumer on his Web site . " The odds of a severe hurricane hitting in New York City is one every 500 years . They should be ashamed of themselves . " <p> Should they ? Allstate 's Liddy has some justification to be nervous about New York . If we are indeed in the midst of a hurricane-heavy time , there 's ample cause for concern that a severe storm would venture that far north . According to Nicholas K. Coch , a professor of coastal geology at Queens College in New York City , significant hurricanes have slammed into the region before . One in 1821 sank most of the ships in New York Harbor . An 1893 hurricane submerged a populated island , Atlantis-style , that lay south of the present Rockaway shore . In 1938 a hurricane flattened many homes on New York 's Long Island , and waves as high as 50 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ storm killed 700 people . If it occurred today , the Insurance Information Institute estimates that insured losses would total $60 billion . <p> In 2005 the Atlantic hurricane season contained 28 storms , including 15 hurricanes . Seven of these hurricanes were considered severe ; a record four of them hit the U.S. In Katrina 's aftermath , devastated New Orleans remains a fixture in the news media . <p> Meanwhile , Liddy is leading an industry push for federal aid after insurers pay out a certain amount , reported to be $4.5 billion . Katrina caused insured losses of $40.6 billion for the industry overall . " We have all seen on our television screens that the current system is inadequate , " says Liddy . Whether a catastrophe fund will be created is anyone 's guess . A powerful counterargument is that such a government security program will only encourage more building in flood-threatened areas , thus increasing potential loss of life and property . <p> What 's interesting about Allstate is that homeowner 's insurance is not its biggest business . It 's auto coverage , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , auto claims are on the way down : The population is aging and so less accident-prone ; cars are safer ; and drivers are more reluctant to file small claims  --  a leeriness they acquired during a rate spike in 2002 and 2003 , out of fear that an accident report would boost insurance bills . <p> Given that , you might wonder why Allstate bothers writing homeowner 's insurance . One reason is that the homeowner business tends to be more profitable , provided that no acts of God intervene . Accidents occur more often with autos than with homes ; fender benders outnumber house fires . <p> The contrast is seen by comparing the combined ratios of the two lines . That 's how much of a premium dollar goes to claims , reserves for payouts , underwriting expenses and policyholder dividends . If the number is below 100% , the company is making an underwriting profit ( investment income is n't counted here ) . For Allstate in the most recent quarter , the ratio was 84% for autos and 74% for homeowner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both types of insurance gives Allstate the ability to cross-sell . The company also peddles financial products such as annuities and life insurance , although these are much smaller parts of the operation . In industry argot , the " stickiness " of the relationship between Allstate and its customers is enhanced by a multiline product roster . <p> Before Liddy came along , Allstate was a slow-acting , highly bureaucratic organization , says Steven Kauderer , managing director of the North American insurance practice at consultant Mercer Oliver Wyman . " Allstate was a sleepy giant , " he says . " It is more entrepreneurial now . " <p> Perhaps that 's because Liddy 's background is outside insurance . He had worked at security firm ADT , drugmaker G.D . Searle and Sears , Roebuck . As Sears ' chief financial officer , Liddy spun off the retailer 's subsidiary , Allstate , in 1993 . Liddy is stepping down in January ( he will remain as chairman ) , to be succeeded as chief executive by kindred spirit Wilson , meaning any large strategic shift is unlikely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Liddy has never shied away from difficult decisions . His first big move was to broaden the company 's distribution methods and sell through stand-alone agents , call centers and the Internet . The company had to remove 6,500 agents from its payroll and turn them into independent contractors . That move sparked a wave of lawsuits ( a few are still pending ) from agents upset over losing their health insurance and other benefits . <p> Liddy 's next goal was to restrict Allstate mostly to North America , where he believes growth prospects are stronger . Waiting for robust insurance markets to develop in other countries , where governments have long taken care of financial security , will take too long , he reasons . By the end of 2002 the company had sold off all its international divisions , retaining only the homeowner 's and auto insurance operations in Canada . <p> Liddy has also fled the sinkhole called nonstandard auto insurance  --  policies for bad drivers . An insurer can charge very high risk drivers extra , but not enough extra to cover the higher claims @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canceled . But Allstate is a business , not a philanthropy . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Chief Executive Edward Liddy made tough calls early . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) : Liddy protg Thomas Wilson will take over in January . <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : A house on Long Island , N.Y . smashed by the power of the 1938 hurricane .
