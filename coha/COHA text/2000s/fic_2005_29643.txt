Chapter One When I think back on everything terrible that happened that autumn-the murders , the grim discovery I made , the danger I found myself in-I realize I probably could have avoided all of it if my love life had n't been so sucky . Or let me rephrase that . Nonexistent . Late in the summer , I 'd been kicked to the curb by a guy I was fairly gaga over , and though my heart no longer felt as raw as a rug burn , my misery had morphed into a sour , man-repellent mood . It was as if I had a sign over my head that said , " Step any closer and I 'm gon na bitch-slap you . " So when I was invited to spend an early fall weekend free of charge at the Cedar Inn and Spa in Warren , Massachusetts , I grabbed the chance . Trust me , I was n't expecting to meet anyone there-except maybe a few rich women in pastel sweat suits and fanny packs who thought having their bodies slathered in shea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admit that I 've generally found spa stuff pretty goofy . I once had a complimentary prune-and-pumpkin facial , and when it was over I kept thinking that I should be stationed on a sideboard between a roast turkey and cornbread stuffing . But I do go nuts for a good massage , and I was hoping that a few of those and a change of scenery would improve my mood as well as jump-start my heart . Unfortunately , soon after I arrived at the inn , all hell broke loose . I pulled into Warren just before seven on Friday night . A reasonable arrival time , but three damn hours later than I 'd originally planned . A combination of things had thrown my schedule into a tizzy . I 'm a freelance journalist , specializing in human-interest and crime stories , and an interview that I was scheduled to do with a psychologist for an article on mass hysteria got pushed from morning to midafternoon . I would have liked to just blow it off entirely . But the piece was due at the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I did n't hit the road until three-thirty , guaranteeing that I 'd have a good chance of getting caught in a rush-hour mess somewhere between Manhattan and Massachusetts-and I did . In addition , I was undone by a smoldering car fire on the southbound side of the New York State Thruway , which caused people on my side to practically crawl by on their haunches so they could get a better look . You would have thought the front half of the Titanic had been dredged and deposited along the side of the road . If I 'd arrived on schedule , I would have been welcomed by the owner of the inn , Danielle ( aka Danny ) Hubner . She was the one treating me to an all-expenses-paid weekend . An old college friend of my mother 's , Danny had been pleading for me to visit the inn since she 'd opened it three or four years ago . But I 'd always been too crazed with work-or too caught up in the stages of grief that followed the demise two years ago of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and manic horniness . This fall , because of my snarky mood , I 'd finally said yes . It would be great , I figured , to not only be pampered 24/7 , but also to spend a nice chunk of time with Danny . She was really my friend , too , and she had a slightly offbeat personality that I found absolutely refreshing . I got the sense my visit would also prove beneficial to her . My mother had called right before she flew to Athens for a Mediterranean cruise to say that Danny had seemed in a bit of a slump lately , but she did n't know why . My mother was worried she might be having troubles with her second husband , George , whom I 'd yet to meet-and whom my mother did n't seem wild about . Since I arrived so late , I 'd missed Danny . According to the desk clerk , she 'd driven into town on business she could no longer put off , but she 'd left word that she would check in with me later . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my room . The inn , a rambling , clapboard building probably erected in the mid-1800s , was really quite smashing , even more so than in the pictures I 'd seen . Instead of dripping with the cutesy country charm that you so often find at a restored inn , the decor was elegant , pared down-lots of beige and cream tones and brown-and-white-check fabric . And there was n't a whirligig , weather vane , or wooden swan in sight . Since I was late , I figured I 'd blown any chance of getting a treatment that night , but my guide explained that Danny had arranged for me to be squeezed in for a massage at eight-before a late dinner . The inn 's spa , which also operated as a day spa for the area , stayed open until ten . I had about fifteen minutes to catch my breath before the massage . My room was maximum charming , a suite , actually , with a small living area . It also sported checks , but in red and white and paired with several quirky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkle and hung them in the closet . ( I 'm a contributing writer for Gloss magazine , and I read in a recent issue that you should roll your clothes in tissue paper before packing them in order to prevent wrinkles , but I 'd no sooner take the time to do that than I would to iron my underpants . ) Next I took a very quick shower , letting the spray of hot water do a number on muscles achy from a long car ride . I dried myself off with a thick Egyptian-cotton towel . Thanks to a towel warmer , it was as toasty as a baked potato . As I buffed my body with it , I noticed a small earthenware jar on the bathroom countertop . It was filled to the brim with amber-colored bath salts , and a little tag announced their availability for sale in the spa . They were a blend of sandalwood and sweet orange aromatics with a hint of frankincense , prepared , the tag said , so I could " surrender to a state of total enchantment and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I needed . Was it actually suggesting I could get both in the same weekend ? I glanced up , into the mirror above the sink . I 'm five six , with short , brownish blond hair , and blue eyes , and I 'm considered pretty in a slightly sporty way , but there was no denying that at this moment in time , I looked weary , even burned-out . It was going to take a helluva lot of bath salts to leave me feeling enchanted and empowered . I arrived downstairs at the spa with just a few minutes to spare . It was actually a large addition to the inn , abutting the eastern edge of the building . The decor was Asian inspired : beige walls , cracked stone floors , bamboo plants in large putty-colored pots , and hallways lined with sheer beige curtains that poofed outward from the breeze that you created walking by them . It was very different from the decor of the inn , but because they both featured such muted tones , it all seemed to work together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited for ten minutes in the so-called relaxation room . Haunting Asian music played in the background , water gurgled over stones in a small fountain , and the scent of green tea wafted from two flickering candles . I tried to let go and relish it , but I felt a little silly . It was as if I 'd somehow stumbled into a scene from Crouching Tiger , Hidden Dragon . Fortunately , it was only a few minutes before I was led to a treatment room . I could barely wait for my massage to start , for the chance to have those sore muscles unknotted . My only concern was that it had been so long since I 'd had any physical contact with another member of my species that I might begin to whimper at the first touch-like a poor little pound puppy . Unfortunately , on a scale of one to ten , the massage was no more than a seven . My " therapist , " a red-haired woman in her thirties , was skilled enough and had plenty of strength in her hands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she worked . It was enough to make me wonder if I had something weird happening on my butt-like a humongous boil-that was forcing her to stop and gape in horror . I was almost relieved when I was finally back in my suite and could totally veg . After ordering a club sandwich and a glass of Merlot from room service , I unpacked most of the rest of the stuff from my bag , sticking my underwear and shirts in a dresser . In the early days that I 'd traveled , I used to wonder who actually used hotel dressers , but lately , at the ripe old age of thirty-three , I 'd come to discover that I prefer not having to forage through my suitcase each time I get dressed . My food arrived within twenty minutes and , ravenous , I devoured it . Then , after opening the window a crack , I undressed and turned back the thick white duvet on the bed . I was looking forward to reading between sheets that felt as if they exceeded a three-hundred-thread count . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could feel my mind itching to go places it should n't . In other words , it was dying to ruminate about my most recent love trouble . His name was Jack Herlihy , and he was a thirty-five-year-old professor of psychology from Washington , D.C. , whom I 'd met in May after he 'd come up to teach a summer course in New York . At the time , Jack had come across like a breath of fresh air compared to most of the guys I 'd been meeting . He was great looking , nice without being a wuss , and an amazing listener ( well , he was a shrink ) , and he managed to be all of these things without ever showing up , like some New York men , with too much product in his hair . He seemed like a straight shooter , not the kind of guy who promises to call the next day but does n't for weeks , giving you reason to believe that he calculates his time in dog years . Jack did n't like games-or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most of my Jack ruminations generally involved trying to figure out how I 'd blown things . Admittedly , our romance had gotten off to a slow start , but he 'd seemed okay with the pace , and it was certainly fine with me . I 'd been fairly skittish since my ex-husband-the attorney-at-law and gambler-at-large-had fled the scene . Jack and I had some fun nights in the Village ( he was hoping to eventually relocate to New York ) , one glorious day on the beach on Fire Island , and a night of half-naked groping in his apartment , during which I explained I wanted to wait a little longer for the full-frontal variety . Then , in the beginning of July , Jack announced that his younger sister had meningitis and he was going to be going home to Pittsburgh each weekend to help his family . Since his life was about to become insane , he wanted to put our relationship on hold for the next few weeks-until he and his family were through the worst . I promised to be there when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact through July and the first week of August , and then suddenly I stopped hearing from him . I told myself to be patient , that he was caught up in the crisis . But after several weeks had gone by and he was still incommunicado , I started to panic . Since I did n't have any reason to believe he 'd entered the Federal Witness Protection Program , I suspected that I 'd been given the boot . But wait , things get worse . Just before Labor Day , as I was cruising the Village in search of fall shoes , I spotted him from a distance with a couple of cute female student types-he seemed talky , flirtatious , Mister Not-a-Friggin ' -Care-in-the-World . As I 'd ducked on wobbly legs into a store to avoid being seen , it was finally clear that it was o-v-e-r . The only question left in my mind was why ? Had he not been that interested in me to begin with and his sister 's illness had become a good excuse to put distance between us ? Had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart ? Had my request to take the sexual part of the relationship slowly discouraged him despite the fact that he had sounded okay with it ? Just as I was about to travel this tiresome ground in my mind for the millionth time , the phone rang . " Bailey , it 's Danny . I did n't wake you , did I ? " As she spoke , I could see her in my mind 's eye . She was in her early sixties , pretty , or rather handsome , I 'd say , with blondish gray hair lightly curled . And she was tiny-only about five feet tall and as slim as a candlewick . " No , no , I 'm just lying in bed with a book , " I said . " Danny , your inn is absolutely gorgeous . You 've done an amazing job with it . " " Thank you so much , dearest . How has your evening been ? " Well , for the last twenty minutes I 'd been tapping a freshly scabbed emotional bruise , seeing if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detail . " Terrific . I had a lovely massage and then a light dinner up here in my room-or should I say my suite fit for a princess . " " Who was your massage therapist , do you recall ? " " A woman . Redhead . Name started with a P , I think . " " Piper . She has wonderful hands , do n't you think ? " " Yes , definitely . " I was n't going to get Piper in any kind of trouble by saying her heart had n't been totally into her work tonight . " By the way , I 've set up a meeting for you and Josh , the spa manager , at four tomorrow-if that 's still okay with you . " I write a few travel articles each year-it 's a free way to see the world and also a nice break from the crime grind-and Danny was hoping that while I was ensconced at the inn I could provide some ideas on how to better pitch her place to editors and travel writers . " Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get to see you ? " " How about breakfast together tomorrow morning ? " Danny asked . " Would nine work for you ? " " Absolutely , though I still may be in a stupor from my massage . " She laughed lightly , like someone jangling her keys . " Well , you know what I always say-too much of a good thing is wonderful . Just wait till you have some of the other treatments I 've got booked for you . Have you ever had a massage with hot stones before ? " " No-but I 'm game for anything as long as it does n't involve colonics . " " Oh , Bailey , you always make me laugh , " she said . " Well , I 'm going to turn in now because my head is throbbing for some reason . I 'm staying here at the inn tonight , by the way , in case you need to reach me . " " Do you do that to see things from the guests ' perspective ? " " Partly . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone . Our house is n't far from here , but it 's very secluded . Shall we meet in the lobby , then ? " " See you then . I ca n't wait . " And I meant it . I felt a tremendous debt to Danny . She had been so good to me when my father died the year I was twelve , taking me on all sorts of little adventures and day trips at a time when my mother was struggling so much that it was hard for her to comfort me . Danny must have sensed early on my fascination for the macabre , because one of our excursions had been to Salem , to learn more about the witch trials . My mother had looked slightly agog at both of us when she 'd learned where we 'd ended up that day , but it had been pure heaven for me . My family eventually lost touch with Danny , during a period when she 'd lived out west in a bad marriage . Continues ...         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
