Almost a Lady By Jane Feather Random House Jane Feather The two women walking arm in arm down The Leas along the seafront in Folkestone drew admiring glances from those they passed . There was something striking about their physical differences , one tall and well formed , creamy skinned , dark haired , with large golden-brown eyes , the other small and slight , with the pale freckled complexion that so often went with red hair and lively green eyes . Meg Barratt paused , slipping her arm out from her companion 's , and turned to look across the waters of the Strait of Dover . She rested her folded arms on the wall and lifted her face to the salt spray . The breeze caught her hair , sending red curls flying around her triangular face . She laughed and put a hand to her fashionable straw bonnet . " I can smell a storm brewing , Bella , " she observed . Her companion , who had stopped beside her , sniffed the wind . " It does n't look like a storm . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a cloud in sight . " " Look over there . " Meg pointed towards the horizon . A dark shadow of a bank of cloud was just visible . The duchess of St. Jules shook her head with amusement . " You always did fancy yourself as a meteorological expert . " " It 's my country breeding , lassie , " Meg returned in a fair approximation of a broad Kentish accent . " And I can also tell when the tide 's coming in . " " Even I can do that , " her friend scoffed , peering down at the line of waves creeping up over the sand below the wall . " Besides , you have only to look at the harbor . " Meg glanced towards Folkestone harbor , where a flotilla of boats were at anchor . The air of urgency was clear even from this distance . Sailors and porters rushed hither and thither , leaping from ship to shore as the boats were readied for an on-tide departure . Some were private yachts , some small merchantmen , and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both of them . Her eye was drawn to a sloop-of-war anchored just inside the harbor . The row of guns on her upper deck gleamed in the afternoon sun . Here too there was the impression of haste and preparation . A dinghy drew up alongside the sloop and a man stepped out of the boat and onto the rope ladder dangling down the ship 's side . He went up with an agile speed and grace that Meg could only admire and swung himself over the deck rail in one movement . She watched as he climbed to the quarterdeck , a small figure in the distance but somehow , to Meg 's imagination , a significant one . She shrugged at the fancy and turned away from the wall , preparing to resume the walk . " Where 's Jack this afternoon ? " " At dice with the Prince of Wales , " her friend returned succinctly . " Prinny will lose his shirt , of course , but in a classic triumph of hope over experience he sits down at the tables with Jack absolutely convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chuckled and linked arms with her friend as they continued their promenade . " I think I 've had enough of Folkestone , what do you think , Meg ? " " I think it 's time for me , at least , to return home for a while . My mother 's letters begin to sound plaintive , " Meg replied . " Poor soul , she tries so hard not to lament my lack of a husband , but she 's really in despair . After all this time I 've spent with you and Jack in London , and still not even a hint of a suitor . " She shook her head in mock dismay . " I 'm a lost cause , clearly . " Arabella shot her a sideways glance . " If you do n't mind my saying so , Meg , it 's not so much lack of a suitor , it 's lack of the right kind , " she declared . " You seem to be attracted only to the un-marrying kind . " Meg gave a heavy sigh , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you are , my dear . For some reason I 'm only drawn to bad men . They 're the only ones who are any fun . " Arabella grinned . " I ca n't help but agree with you . Jack 's not exactly the epitome of propriety and he would n't be so much fun if he were . " " The baby 's had an effect on him , though , " Meg observed thoughtfully . " Since little Charles was born he 's become much more . . . " She sought for a word . " Not exactly respectable , he 's too much of a gamester for that , but considered in his manner . " Arabella nodded , a slight smile on her lips at the thought of her husband and child . " Talking of Charles , I must get back . I asked the nursemaid to have him ready by four o'clock so that I could take him for an airing in the carriage . " Meg glanced again towards the horizon . The bank of cloud was closer and the sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think you 'll go far with him this afternoon . " Arabella followed her gaze . " Perhaps you 're right . " " You go on home . I want to go to the lending library . Mrs. Carson said she would put aside a copy of Mrs. Radcliff 's The Italian for me , but she wo n't keep it for more than a day . " " Very well , you take the footman . It 's only a step to the house from here , so I 'll go home alone . " " No , " Meg said firmly . " A duchess needs a proper escort . I , on the other hand , am quite accustomed to racketing around unaccompanied . Besides , the library 's only just up the hill . " She gestured towards a narrow lane leading up steeply from The Leas towards the High Street . Arabella did n't argue with her . Her friend needed her solitude at times , and in this tiny seaside town no one would object to a woman past the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they did , much Meg would care . " I 'll see you later then . " She went off with a farewell wave and Meg turned up the cobbled lane , so narrow that the medieval houses on either side almost formed a roof as they leaned across it and towards each other , casting deep shadow over the damp and slimy cobbles that never felt the sun 's warmth . Out of the sun the mid-April afternoon had a chill to it , exacerbated by the strengthening wind that now and again whistled down the funnel of the alley . Meg drew her cashmere shawl closer around her and wished she had brought a pelisse . Her lavender cambric gown was the height of fashion but too flimsy to offer protection against the elements . She broke into the sunshine again as the lane debouched onto the High Street . The wind was still fresh , though , and she was glad to reach the shelter of the lending library at the top of the street . " Good afternoon , madam , " the woman at the counter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book for you . " She reached down and placed a volume on the counter . " Two other ladies are waiting for it . " " I 'll read it quickly , " Meg promised , caressing the book with her fingertips . " If it 's anything like The Mysteries of Udolpho , I wo n't be able to put it down . " " I think it 's even better , " the woman said , dropping her voice a little and glancing conspiratorially around the almost deserted library . Meg nodded with a smile . " I 'll just take a look around , Mrs. Carson , and see if anything else takes my fancy . " She wandered off towards the shelves of books lining the rear wall of the library . She picked out a copy of William Wordsworth 's tragedy The Borderers and as usual became quickly engrossed . It was with a shock that she realized almost an hour had passed . She had no reason to feel guilty , but absurdly she did as she returned to the front of the library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll borrow this too , Mrs. Carson . " She handed over a shilling . " Best hurry home , Miss Barratt , " the woman advised , wrapping the books in brown paper . " Looks quite dark out there now . " Meg glanced towards the bow window . The sun had vanished and it was now as dark as dusk . " There 's a storm brewing . " She tucked the books wrapped in brown paper under her arm and hurried into the street . There were few people about now , and those there were moved quickly , heads down , as they tried to beat the approaching rain . Thunder rumbled . Meg picked up her skirts and walked fast towards the lane that would take her back down to The Leas . Once she reached there the Fortescus ' hired house was barely two hundred yards along the seafront . Heavy drops of rain splashed onto the cobbles as she turned into the now dark alley . At least there would be some shelter beneath the overarching roofs of the houses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up about halfway along . She frowned . The alley was so narrow there would barely be room for her to squeeze past on either side . She paused to tuck the books more securely under her shawl just as another crack of thunder rolled across the sky and the rain began in earnest . It was so heavy it penetrated the lane ; surprisingly cold and unsurprisingly wet , it soaked her hat in seconds . There were no sheltering doorways , the houses opened directly onto the street , and resigned to a drenching , Meg set off towards the faint glimmer of the sea at the far end . The rain rushed through the kennel in the middle of the cobbled lane heading down the steep slope for the sea below , and the cobbles themselves quickly became even more slimy with mud and floating refuse . Meg 's sandaled foot slipped twice and she grabbed onto the doorframe of a house to regain her balance . The carriage below her still had n't moved and she wondered what business could possibly cause such a large vehicle to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horses , who were at the front facing the sea , but it would need at least four , and they would be impossible to maneuver . She dismissed the puzzle with a brusque head shake and continued more carefully on her way , rain dripping down the back of her neck . Her skirts were soaked , the hem filthy with mud and slime , her sandals were ruined , her shawl bedraggled , her bonnet resembled a mound of wet straw . As she approached the carriage the door swung open as if in invitation . Meg frowned and a flicker of apprehension made her heart beat faster . It was ridiculous , of course . There was nothing to be afraid of in this sleepy seaside town , but the open door was barring her from edging past the vehicle . She was still finding it difficult to keep her footing on the steep slippery cobbles and this merely increased her apprehension . She approached cautiously , and called out , " Could you close the door please , I need to pass . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had drowned out her voice but how could the occupants of the carriage not even think that someone might want to pass ? And why the devil were they sitting there with the door open in the middle of a rainstorm ? She tried to pass the carriage on the other side , resting her hand on the back as she stepped cautiously around . Suddenly the vehicle lurched forward . Her foot slipped and she fell backwards into the rushing water of the kennel . For a split second she realized her danger . . . the water in its headlong flood was going to carry her beneath the carriage down to the sea . And then she realized nothing more . She opened her eyes onto a strange and different world . A pitching , tossing world . She was lying flat on a cot that was more like a box than a bed , but when this world gave a particularly violent heave she saw the point of the wooden sides . It was dark and however hard she stared into the gloom she could n't manage to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was muzzy and aching and her stomach felt somewhat uncertain . It seemed easiest simply to close her eyes again , so she did . When next she awoke it was to a light-filled world of quiet rocking . A voice cackled , " Wake up . . . wake up . " Gingerly Meg turned her head sideways , aware of a tenderness somewhere at the back of her scalp . A large scarlet bird with very long tail feathers was sitting on a perch regarding her with remarkably bright beady eyes . " Wake up , " it repeated and gave a cackle of laughter . Meg wondered if she had died and this was some mad afterlife peopled by scarlet talking birds and an eternally rocking foundation . " Do be quiet , " she said to the bird , who was still punctuating its repeated instruction with manic laughter . To her astonishment it fell silent . Carefully she lifted her head and felt the soreness . There was a lump just behind her right ear . That was reassuring . Bumps belonged to the real world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She 'd been drenched and the water from the kennel had been about to carry her in full flood beneath the wheels of the carriage . . . The accident had not damaged her memory at least . Every detail of those moments was as clear as daylight . But what had happened afterwards ? She lifted the coverlet and peered along her body , clad , astonishingly enough , in an extremely elegant nightgown . " G'day . . . g'day . . . " the bird ventured , tilting its head , the beady eye glinting as it watched her . " Good day , " Meg said , sitting up in the box . An array of windows showed a gently moving sunlit sea . So she was on a boat . . . not too difficult a conclusion . But how , not to mention why ? She looked around at the compact paneled space . It was surprisingly comfortable , a carpet that looked to be Aubusson on the floor , cushioned benches beneath the windows , a table and two chairs in the center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like cupboards set into the paneling . And one door that clearly led somewhere . A light tap on that door made her heart jump . She swallowed but before she could say anything , the scarlet bird cawed , " Come in . . . come in . " The door opened and a man stepped inside , closing the door carefully behind him . The bird rose up on the perch and flapped its wings . Instantly Meg 's visitor held out his arm and the bird swooped from its perch to the offered wrist like a falcon returning to his jesses . Meg stared at him . " Who the devil are you ? " she demanded . Her visitor 's slight smile was a gleaming white flash in a deeply tanned face . He leaned his shoulders against the door and regarded her with an amiable curiosity . " Oddly enough , I was about to ask you exactly the same question . "
