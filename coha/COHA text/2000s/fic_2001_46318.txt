Chickens <p> THE HONEYMOON WAS OVER before it began . The sweep of bridal frenzy-a wave of white tulle and bone china and petits fours  --  receded , leaving a litter of soggy napkins and a half-eaten cake . <p> For Lisa the planning had been like a drug , each day upping the dosage , each dose successfully veiling any fears or doubts or anxieties about what she was about to do with the rest of her life . Her energy kicked in full-force just as out-of-town relatives arrived ; they came in carloads , moved into the Red Carpet Inn and Bell 's Econo Lodge . They toasted her , gave her gifts , wished her a long and happy life . She had never before received so much attention , and now as she sat in the passenger seat , seeing Alan and the gold ring on his finger that matched her , own , she was shocked . She had almost forgotten that he was a part of it all . It was her wedding . She planned it ; her parents paid for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too little sleep . The spinning world had slammed to a halt and thrown her for a loop . Her mind had not ventured beyond those moments in the church ; she had not looked beyond the stained-glass windows she had studied her entire childhood when the sermons were too boring or too threatening to absorb . Noah , Jonah , Moses , Jesus . They were all there . <p> But where was she ? <p> They had flown to Pennsylvania ( a state she had never in her life visited ) , rented a car , and now here they were , driving through the Poconos . This had been her idea ( Alan vetoed her first choice of Niagara Falls ) , and now she knew she had made a terrible mistake . These mountains were not so great . They were no better than those of western North Carolina or the Shenandoah Valley , where she had visited relatives every autumn when she was a kid . Now , looking at these foreign mountains depressed the hell out of her . Now , with mounting horror , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " I knew this was a mistake , " Alan said as he slowed down , and she jerked to attention , afraid he 'd read her thoughts . But he was talking about the hotel up ahead , which looked nothing like the pictures at the back of the bridal magazines : " Look , there 's not even anybody parking cars or carrying luggage . " This was no big deal for her . That she might someday wake up and have to stop waiting on herself was a foreign thought . When Alan finally found somebody to get their bags , a slouched teenage boy who wore jeans and a Hard Rock Cafe T shirt , she had already carried everything over near the big front door . " It was the principle , " Alan said . He tipped the boy less than he would have had he been wearing a little monkey suit and cap , and they went to the lengthy checkin line , joining the crying babies and chain-smoking women in pool attire . <p> Alan had done all this once before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his interest . He had surfaced periodically with the voice of experience-make sure the bridesmaid dresses are selected with the least attractive girl in mind , " nothing worse than one tall , lean beauty in chiffon followed by a bunch of pastel stuffed sausages " - and then he would follow up with an anecdote about when he and Susan Hunter Malloy got married . Of course , Susan Hunter knew all these things , because she had older sisters and not only were all of them married but they had all made their debuts in Raleigh . <p> And where are they now , all these decades later ? Lisa had wanted to ask . Sipping tea with the queen ? But that would have been acknowledging that her future husband was also quite a bit older . He was fourteen years older , in fact , which early on had seemed a positive thing . She had been surprised that such a smart and successful man had been interested in her at all . He had chosen cosmetic surgery as his specialty ( he said for esthetic reasons ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune . He and Susan Hunter had wanted to ensure early retirement , beach house , Ivy League colleges for the kids , nice cars . Now Susan Hunter had a huge chunk of all of that . She spent her summers down at the beach with her children , who were closer to Lisa 's age . Rumor had it that Susan Hunter had never looked better . <p> " I guess she does look good , " Alan liked to respond to anyone who commented , most recently his college roommate , who had bumped into her while visiting Figure Eight Island . " I gave her the breasts as an anniversary present years ago . The nose for Christmas one year . Tummy  --  tuck to celebrate when she got her interior-design degree . The butt-lift was right around the corner . " He paused . " But , of course , then I met Lisa . " He looked at her when he said this , and she laughed and shrugged it off because what she was really thinking about was whether to register silver plate as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; why spend time polishing something unless it 's the real thing ? His mother said yes ; it would be nice for little brunches and afternoon events . Where ? At the old folks ' home ? She said Alan had not gotten silver plate the first time , but it was because it was back before the big jump in sterling . Alan and Susan Hunter had gotten tons of sterling . <p> They met at the Empowerment Workshop , which Lisa was told used to be called something else , but they got a bad rap for not letting people pee when they needed to . It sounded like a tough-love course for people with money , people like Alan . She was there as one of several undergraduate students hired to man the doors and hand out Kleenex and point out the bathrooms , serve coffee at the breaks . Alan , handsome in a gray pinstriped suit even though all the other people were dressed down , was one of the first to stand and deliver a tragic story about how he had never felt loved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cat 's in the Cradle " ( he actually sang a few bars ) was completely applicable to him . He was all shook up by the end , crying about how he , in turn , had not always been the best father and that even though he was now a single parent , he wanted to make a difference . <p> " He 's kind of cute , " Emily , the graduate student working with Lisa , had whispered . " I 'm going to check him out at the break after he 's blown his nose and collected himself . " <p> If not for this statement by a studious , sensible girl Lisa admired , she might never have given Alan a second look . She personally did not like the exhibitionist aspect of the Empowerment Workshop . Besides , at the time all she could think about was Randy , whom she had known her whole life and had always assumed she would marry . She was thinking of the time she sat on the riverbank reading while Randy ventured out in a rowboat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole in the boat when a snake dropped from a tree and startled him . Once she knew he was safely back on shore , that scene never failed to make her laugh , and she relied on it when bored and needing to pass the time . She was thinking of Randy at the break when the graduate student dashed by to whisper that she had found someone else , who though not as handsome as the crying man in the pinstripe was definitely more her type . Lisa absentmindedly served coffee while she watched Emily talking and laughing with a guy who wore a long gray ponytail and Birkenstocks . He had not yet spoken before the group , because Lisa certainly would have remembered . He was wearing enough turquoise to sink a ship . <p> And there was Alan , dry-eyed and cool-looking , extending his hand for a cup of coffee . He had come back from his inner child and was telling her about his professional life . Lisa had actually heard of him . Her mother knew women who had secretly been to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about going . It was the first time Lisa had gone out with someone whom all women-young and old alike-were interested in hearing about . At first her parents did n't trust him . Her dad said there was something shifty about him , and Lisa 's brother , Mike , just out of high school , said " Shifty or shitty ? " Mike was completely devoted to Randy ; at times it seemed he was the one enduring a breakup . <p> " Why are you going out with him ? " her mother asked . " It is n't the money , is it ? " <p> " No way , " Lisa said . <p> " Well , why do you guess he 's going out with you ? " <p> " What do you mean by that ? " she asked . " I 'm not good enough ? " <p> Lisa knew her mother meant well , that what she really wanted to ask about was Randy and if Lisa had seen him . Her mother had already asked one time too many , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never experienced in all her life . " Fuck Randy , " she said , her parents sitting there in the his-and-hers recliners they 'd given each other for their twenty-fifth anniversary , " everybody else has . " Now her mother knew not to utter a peep . <p> The truth was that after years of loyalty , Randy had screwed up , and she had caught him . He was going out with other people , had been for over six months . Randy Randy , her roommate said . So what if her parents loved him like a son ? So what if he had been the one to straighten Mike out back in ninth grade when he was on the verge of trouble ? <p> He said he was unsure of the future . Well , who is n't , she asked . He said he had accidentally slept with a girl who lived right there in Lisa 's dorm . She had yet to figure that one out . Over and over he kept asking what he was going to do . Take over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Or should he just chuck all that and take some time off , maybe trek cross-country , camp some , visit a few friends ? Regardless of what he chose-if history counted for anything-he 'd change his mind in a month or two . <p> The hardest part of the breakup was that she and Randy had all the same memories and points of reference , and though she tried to cut him away from her thoughts like tearing a face from a photo , it was impossible . Everything she knew about boys and what they liked or did n't like came straight from Randy . If people saw her , they asked about him , and vice versa . She had been the one part of his life he remained faithful to , or so she had always thought . Now she was beginning to wonder . <p> But Randy was trying to find himself , a euphemism Lisa despised . That 's what all the people on the soap operas were doing-trying to find themselves . Whenever a character said that , the girls clustered in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She made the mistake of telling all her friends about Randy , not knowing that many of them already knew . Many of them , in fact , were secretly hoping to hear from him themselves . They called him a hunk ; they called him a fox . It was a mistake to have aired her laundry , because late that spring when he came back around , still unsure what to do with his life but certain he wanted to get back together , her pride got in the way of what she really wanted to do . " Well , think about it , " he said . " I 'll be around . " The girls on her hall called him a rounder . They called him a chick magnet . <p> At the time she convinced herself she was acting on her own desires , only to worry later that she had let her fears about what the other girls would think ( girls she 'd probably never see again ) overpower her own feelings . She put him off a few more times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would definitely teach him not to ever do that to her again . She did not return his call even though more than anything she missed their late nights at The Rocky Horror Picture Show , where they dressed up and acted out all the parts like the hundreds of other cult followers crammed into the small , dark theater on Main Street . After the show , they used to go to Snoopy 's , a popular hangout that stayed open all night . Sometimes they sat there until the sun came up . Sometimes they talked about what their future would be like-the house ( a cabin built near the river , the back porch facing westward so they could watch the sun go down over the tobacco fields he would one day own ) , the brood of kids ( at least five ) , the dogs ( the bigger the better ) . The Rocky Horror party they would throw every Halloween . Sometimes they talked about things that had happened back in grade school or junior high , stories and gossip about people in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut out anyone else around . She had never even thought what life would be like without those stories . And then she heard that Randy had been dating all along , that he had been seeing the same girl for several dates , a Chi 0 from Richmond , a tiny , tanned Chi 0 with a 3.7 grade-point average who drove a little red Karmann Ghia and was madly in love with Randy . Why did people feel the need to tell her all this ? Was it like that story her father used to tell about chickens in the barnyard , how they can all be living in harmony and then if one starts bleeding they all rush in and peck it to death ? He told that , of course , to make Lisa and Mike sensitive to the weaknesses of others . It translated to Do n't bully or tease people ; be someone who steps in and defends what 's right . But she had never imagined that she would one day be the bleeder , that she would spend three days cooped in her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Her suitemate , a girl known for her impeccable taste and fastidious hygiene and clearly well versed in the rules to being a good person , insisted that she get up and wash her hair and get dressed . And the next week , with Lisa still not out of the woods , that same girl insisted she take the job as door-watcher for the Empowerment Workshop . The only other choice for campus volunteers was door-watcher for the evangelist who was coming right before summer . JERRY IS COMING SOON , the signs read . Jerry , she later heard , claimed to have received a letter from God that was written on the back of a Twix candy wrapper . Spread the word , Jerry , the letter said . <p> How different her life would have been if she had gone to that one . There certainly would n't have been a date to come out of it . Instead she would have called Randy to see if he remembered the time a boy in their school pretended to be blind so he could then be healed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Randy would have remembered the boy 's name and who they had been playing , and then they would have pretended that nothing had ever happened . He would have come over to get her and they would have gone to get a pizza and that would have been that . <p> When she met Alan , he talked a lot about the real world and how so many kids her age had no idea what they were in for when they were actually expected to work and participate in adult venues . " Except someone like you , of course , " he added . He made her feel smart and mature . He constantly commented on her appearance , saying she was someone he would n't dream of raising a scalpel to ; there was nothing to perfect . She did n't believe that , but still it was enough to make her want to keep her brows plucked and her legs waxed , to primp and preen as she had watched her suitemate do . She never mentioned Randy to Alan , except to say that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ended because he had needed some time to find himself . <p> " Oh , please , " Alan said , " I have n't said that since I was fifteen . " At the time she was still so hurt and angry at Randy that she relished hearing someone else attack him . Randy could not afford one of Alan 's shoes , not to mention the pearl and diamond earrings he gave her . Randy 's idea of a good present had been water skis and a thong bikini she had never had the nerve to wear . She was impressed by Alan 's good looks and his Italian suits ( though she never would have known their nationality if not told ) , the gray Volvo he insisted she drive because it was so much safer than her Dodge Dart , the places he took her for dinner ( her suitemates begged her to order big and then get doggie bags ) . <p> Still , she had moments when she felt washed in homesickness and desperate to reclaim what had always been hers . She wished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to get food from Taco Bell and then sit in the middle of Hollydale Cemetery , where they leaned against the side of the only mausoleum in the place . They had been going there since fifth grade , when they chalked their initials on the cool marble slab and vowed that every word spoken in this place was top-secret . It was their place , something they had never told another living soul about . But by graduation she had put Randy out of her mind and instead was trying to decide what to do with her life . Teach high-school French as her diploma entitled her to do ? Go to graduate school ? <p> She had gotten used to riding along beside Alan . She was used to the way the seats ' soft leather felt against the backs of her legs , the way the car smelled clean and like the cologne Alan wore ( Aramis ) and not like stale beer and cigarettes and wet dog . He talked at great length about his work and about his clients ( swearing her to secrecy ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him dry . It made her feel more mature than she had ever imagined being . She felt secure in the knowledge from one day to the next that someone was planning where she would eat and what she would do , and sometimes even what she would wear . She had read that many women seek this , a comfort zone that enables them to exist without physical hardships or worries . Then they can focus on the part of themselves that is creative and independent ; they can raise children in a comfortable nest . <p> She was living at her parents ' after graduating , so she was still privy to all the hometown news : Randy had brought a girl to meet his family . They went with his mother to church on Sunday , even though Randy had n't been to church in years . Lisa knew from the descriptions that it was the same Chi 0 girl , and she confirmed it when she rode by his parents ' house late one Sunday night when she could n't sleep and saw the little red car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , half  --  hoping Randy would see her sitting there . <p> Later that same week , she heard that Randy was applying to vet school and was going to take a year off in the interim . Work a little , move in with the girlfriend , who would be starting graduate work in the fall . She saw him at the A &P; soon after hearing this and crept up behind him , placed her hands over his eyes , but before he could even guess , the girlfriend was standing beside him , her arm looped through his . " You must be Lisa , " she said without cracking a smile . " Randy has told me all about you , all about your little secret places like the one we went to today-creepy-and languages from grade school . Cute . " If his eyes showed any apology for his betrayal she did n't see it , and after a polite exchange-he asked if she was still involved with the " plastic doc " - she dashed out of the store , abandoning her cart behind the greeting-card @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alan asked her to move in with him . Who would n't ? After all , here was this successful , nice-looking person ready to take care of her for life . And marriage made the most sense of all . What she had with Randy was a kid thing ; intellectually she knew this was the choice that made the most sense for her . So she read Bride magazine cover to cover , and the thought of herself in one of those dresses , the wonderful place settings to choose from , the whole prospect of buying her very own house with window treatments and furniture , thrilled her beyond belief and took up a good chunk of her time . She would have to think about school or a job later , after the wedding . She might even decide not to get a job at all , ever , a luxury she had never dreamed of having . <p> Randy sent her a wedding gift-a doormat that said " Wipe Your Paws " and a cookbook with all of Elvis Presley 's favorite meals , called Fit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fearing what he might say , though for several late nights she scoured the pages of the cookbook for a hidden message-anything , a hair from his head , a turned-down page that might lead her to read every word for the message . She told herself that if there was not a sign , she should let go and move on . <p> " Are you sure this is what you want ? " her mother had asked , and though she had a chilling moment his truck with the Chi 0 , showing her all the places and telling her all the things they had sworn to keep secret , and it made her sink her heels deeper . It made her turn her attention to some more expensive choices : She went from Gorham to Wedgwood . Everyone got cold feet . She studied the travel ads in the back of the magazines . Alan had said they could go anywhere on their honeymoon-anywhere she wanted . <p> " Niagara Falls or the Poconos . " She had stated her choices finally so he would n't talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might want to visit as an older person . And of course going to a place known for honeymoons was corny , but that was part of the fun of it all . She imagined they would take photos of the two of them lounging in a heart-shaped tub . It would be the sort of thing you could pull out and laugh about for the rest of your life . Alan said he had taken Susan Hunter on a cruise , and though he could not afford it at the time , the two of them had always been happy that they splurged and did it up big . <p> " Well , this is what I want , " she said , and showed him all the pictures in the magazines . " There is a swimming pool right in your room . " <p> " Oh God . " He sighed his worldly sigh and laughed . " If this is what you want , then OK . " <p> There was condescension in his voice ; she heard it loud and clear , but she would prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hotel entryway , she anticipated his saying I told you so . It looked nothing like the pictures . It looked as much like the Bates Motel as it did the pictures . She had read recently that Janet Leigh never showered after making Psycho . Who could blame her ? Janet was in Psycho , and Tony Curtis played the Boston Strangler . No wonder Jamie Lee Curtis wound up making those Halloween movies . She said all this to Alan , but he claimed to know nothing about cult movies and horror shows . He only knew films , and he was prone to not like what other people liked . He called it discriminating . There was a time , less than a year ago , when she would have called it boring . Randy would have said So who died and made you the goddamn authority ? <p> Heart-shaped tubs and round beds . Fireplaces . Jacuzzis . It was clear that at one time this had been the place to go-like maybe in the ' 60s . The nightclub entry was lined with photos of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Charo , one of the most recent , the giggling Spanish woman who got famous by screaming " kichie kichie " while beating on a guitar and wearing next to nothing . <p> While they waited , Alan commented that Lisa looked sad and then explained that what she was feeling was a kind of postpartum after all the excitement of the wedding . He said Susan Hunter had experienced something very similar after their wedding and after the births of both children . " It 's one of those female things , " he said . Randy would have had something sarcastic to say back to that , something smart and cynical . She realized then that part of her honeymoon fantasy had always been that Randy would be there . Other than family vacations , she had never traveled anywhere without him . He loved nothing better than a road trip . <p> Once , during her sophomore year in college , they had headed out with no destination in mind . At every fork he 'd ask her to choose left or right . They finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what looked like a ghost town of little pastel cinder-block buildings . Other than the Days Inn where they got a room , there was a rundown shopping center with a grocery store and laundromat . When they asked the person at the motel desk what there was to do , she pointed them in the direction of what she called the arcade . It was an old gas station that now housed several pinball machines and a pool table . The main attraction was the dancing chicken . Deposit a quarter outside its glass cage and kernels of corn were made available behind a chute that would open if the chicken danced over the red button on the floor . Sometimes the chicken kept dancing even when the chute was empty . It reminded Lisa of the story of the red shoes and that poor girl who could n't stop dancing ; her choices were to dance herself to death or to cut off her feet . They had so much fun that they came back the next semester with several friends in tow . Nothing had changed . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But that was before they went to the arcade to find that the dancing chicken had been replaced by a big rat snake who occasionally ate a live mouse but otherwise did nothing . There was a sign saying DO N'T TAP THE GLASS , so of course everyone did . They never saw anyone who actually worked at the arcade , so there was no way to find out what happened to the chicken . Lisa was sure it had danced itself to death . Randy suggested that it had eaten itself to death , that maybe a tour bus of lost but well-meaning travelers pumped quarter after quarter into the slot . Or maybe somebody got hungry one night and wrung its neck , fried it up . Either way , it was gone . <p> Finally they were all checked in , just in time for a flock of kids to rush past and into a room off the lobby as big as a skating rink , and as loud . There was a clown entertaining children . He had a cotton-candy machine . There was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he twisted and shaped into animals that children wore on their heads . There was a magician , and someone who could cornrow the girls ' hair and apply henna tattoos . It was a bar mitzvah. 0y . Funny what manhood looks like from a distance . <p> This was so not what she had expected , but she clung to the notion of the little pool in the room and how she was going to stretch out on that round bed fully clothed and fall into a deep , deep sleep . She did n't care if she slept through the honeymoon night and on into the next day . All she wanted now was sleep and rest . It was the postwedding jitters , that was all , and come morning she would be OK again . She would see , by the light of day , that she had made the right decision , that this was the beginning of a wonderful life together . <p> But they had only an hour left to be served in the dining room , so Alan checked their bags @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signs . Outside the door to the restaurant , where they had to wait in line yet again , there was someone drawing caricatures , someone selling costume jewelry , and a psychic . Her little sign said ASK ROSE , and there were other little signs featuring comments from satisfied customers . Things like ROSE SAVED MY LIFE , POCONOS ROSE KNOWS , I WILL NEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN . Apparently Rose did palms , tarot , or she would simply talk to you about what lay ahead . <p> Lisa was watching several women huddled together waiting their turns . Rose looked up and directly at her . The gaze was so strong and intentional that Lisa looked around to see if there might be someone else Rose was staring at . There was no one else . Alan had struck up a conversation with the couple in front of them , a couple closer to his age who were also disappointed in the accommodations . Lisa attempted a smile to acknowledge the dark gaze , but Rose just lifted her chin as if to say I know your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table , but then Alan was pulling her into the dining room and over to a far , darkened corner he had tipped the maitre d ' to get . " What is it ? " he asked , but she did n't dare tell him what she was thinking . That she felt her mind had been read . That perhaps this woman knew more than she did , or maybe knew what Lisa was n't willing to admit to herself . She just said that she was tired . And when they were finally served and finished and about to head up to the bridal suite , all the vendors in the hallway were gone , having left little cardboard placards with their hours and specialties behind . She stood staring at the sign for Poconos Rose , hoping for some clue , some reason to believe she was a phony and that the look she gave Lisa meant absolutely nothing . <p> Their room was drab , with stained wall-to-wall carpeting , old floral spread and drapes ( red and yellow ) . It was not so different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Back then , with Randy , it was funny . Back then she did n't feel embarrassed the way she did now as she and Alan stood in the doorway . He wanted to lift her over the threshold , but she reminded him of his bad back . Anyway , she was very busy taking in the disappointing sights . There was a cheap painting of a mountain scene . There was a bidet , but this was not a bidet of elegance ; rather , it was more like a kind of sex-hygiene thing-quick spritz and you 're ready for more . She could die . She sat on the bed and started crying and when she did Alan was right there behind her , telling her he understood . He did n't even say I told you so . <p> He said , " Don't-worry . Honeymoons can be a bit of a letdown . " <p> She excused herself , locked the bathroom door and looked around in disgust . Where were the heated tile floors they had advertised ? The towel-warmers ? The European spa towels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you feel you were floating on a cloud ? Was she the first person ever to feel this way ? This washover of sick regret ? <p> She dried her eyes and stepped back into the room . She willed herself to picture Randy on this sad evening . He was sitting on the stoop of his parents ' house , where the two of them had sat hundreds of nights waiting for steaks to grill and staring out at the pastures and tobacco fields . Poor , brooding Randy , heartbroken . He was sorry now that he had riot intervened . He would always regret it ; one day he would tell her so , and then she would say that she regretted it , too , and then they would go back to where they had always been-a couple-partners for life . They would not be able to remember which came first , his infidelity or her desire for something more in a relationship . It would n't even be important . <p> She was about to laugh just thinking of the two of them getting back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hopeless . He probably never even thought of her that day , or if he did it was to decide not to put on a suit and go to the wedding . It probably never crossed his mind that he should go and object , that she might need his intervention . <p> She should n't have , but as she lay down beside Alan , she let herself think of bouncing through the fields in Randy 's truck , one of his dogs squeezed between them on the seat . His hair was wild and windblown , and the Marshall Tucker Band blasted from the speakers . They drove down the dirt roads to the river and then sneaked into the old , deserted ice plant , a place they believed none of the other kids had discovered , or if they had , did n't dare to ease through the chained doorway into the cool darkness . <p> In the morning , when Alan suggested they go to the exercise room and then sit in the whirlpool awhile , she begged off with extreme , perhaps irrational , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an environment . She said she would lounge a bit , walk around , but she knew exactly where she was going . Rose had not arrived yet , and there was already a line , two of the women who had been there the night before . Lisa felt uncomfortable sitting there eavesdropping , so she wandered down the hall and into the ladies ' room , where she found Poconos Rose herself , stripped of makeup and jewelry , brushing her dark hair and twisting it up on top of her head . She was pinning it in place when her gaze in the mirror caught Lisa 's . <p> " Do I know you ? " she asked . <p> " Would n't you know that answer ? " Lisa replied . When there was no laughter she apologized and started again . " I saw you last night at your table . " <p> " Yeah , it 's busy around here , " she said . " But the line moves pretty quick , if that 's what you 're worried about . " <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What , then ? " Rose pulled a big purse onto the counter and took out her makeup bag . She applied black eyeliner and a maroon lipstick , both items that made her look much older . " I 'm priced reasonably . " <p> " Oh no , that 's not it , " Lisa said . " You were looking at me last night . " <p> " I was ? " She put her hand to her chest and squinted as if trying to remember . Her eyes were a brilliant emerald-green , clearly contacts . <p> " Yes , I was in line to go to dinner , and I noticed that you were watching me , staring really . I think you saw something . " <p> " Oh ? " Rose crossed her arms over her thin chest and studied Lisa from head to toe . " Were you with a guy in a suit ? A little older ? Kind of executive-looking ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Newlywed . " <p> " Yes ! " Lisa was getting excited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Here 's what comes here : You got the newlyweds ; you got the old ones trying to recapture the first honeymoon-they 're my favorites actually , no offense ; you got the barmitzvah crowd , like last night ? Lord . You got an occasional reunion . " <p> " So there was n't something about me ? " <p> " Should I have seen something ? " <p> " I do n't know . I really thought you did . " Lisa turned and perched on the edge of an old vinyl chair near the door . <p> " Sounds like you wanted me to see something . " <p> " Maybe . " <p> " Like maybe you made a mistake ? " <p> Lisa looked up , eyes wide . Rose was not much older than Lisa if at all , but the way she talked , the way she looked Lisa dead in the eye , made it clear she had already seen far more than Lisa would in a lifetime . She had a hard , muscular stance that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> " Do you ? " Rose threw her lipstick back into her floppy macram6 bag , then turned , exasperated by all the questions . " Look . I really have had a vision or two , OK ? Else I would n't be in this particular business . But what I see in you is what anybody who took two seconds to look could see . " <p> Lisa paused , afraid to ask another question and afraid not to . " Can you tell me what you see ? " She stared down at her hands to avoid Rose 's eyes . <p> " Well OK , last night what I saw was a young woman wearing the kind of suit worn by businesswomen , church ladies , and girls who take the time to plan a going-away outfit . Am I right ? " Lisa nodded . " You 're clearly not one of the first two , and your husband " - she paused , giving the word extra weight- " still had one of those flower things stuck up near his neck . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever . You 're standing there with your arms crossed , looking like you 're at a funeral , and concentrating on my business instead of your own . " She laughed . " And what was I thinking ? I was thinking about how I was in a hurry to get to my kid 's piano lesson . " <p> " I 'm sorry . " <p> " Do n't be . " She shook her head and smiled . " We 've all been there . Maybe this lifetime , maybe another , but we 've been there . " Rose pulled a multicolored scarf from the bag and draped it over one shoulder . She saw Lisa watching and stopped short again ; she seemed to be getting impatient . " OK , so I dress up a little . Most of those people out there would n't pay me the time of day if I did n't look like what they expect me to look like , you know ? I mean I 'm really a blonde , a natural blonde , but who knows a blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyebrows , the fair hairs clearly crayoned over with black pencil . " Men are that way . Friends . Mothers . There 's a certain look we expect , you know ? Sometimes the image is true and sometimes it is n't . " She turned her head from side to side , admiring the swirl of her earrings in the mirror . " We 're all hoping that we can see beyond what the eye sees , but for most it 's just trial and error . You know , you reach a certain age and it 's time to fly the coop , no time to think about anything other than that very moment . There 's never the perfect time . We 'd all do something a little different if given another chance . " <p> " I was fine before the wedding , and now all of a sudden I 'm terrified . It 's crazy . " <p> " Does n't sound crazy to me . " Rose put her bag on her shoulder and took one last look at her reflection . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She closed her eyes and took several deep breaths , raised her arms up high , and swayed back and forth . " There , I 'm ready . " She was about to open the door but then turned back once more . " You know , nobody knows everything . If we did there would be no reason to live . At least you were n't too chicken to try . A lot of people are , you know , and what do they wind up with ? And remember-you 're nothing but a human bean-that 's what my kid would say . Human bean . " Rose laughed and disappeared in a swirl of gold and imitation silk . The door wheezed shut , and immediately Lisa could hear the clamoring-a shrill peep of needy people , like chickens at feeding time , pushing to be first in line . Though tempted to turn and look , Lisa shielded her eyes and ran back to the honeymoon suite . If she could just concentrate on what lay immediately before her , she would be all right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picking and choosing what best suited her life . She Was n't a chicken , and she was n't about to be pecked to death . And if she felt frightened , Alan would be there with an outstretched palm and a promise that he might , or might not , be able to keep . <p> Fish <p> When you learn that you are dying , you take off your glasses and never wear them again . I think that you do n't want to see the looks on our faces as we sit here by your bed . I think you want only the blurry outlines of our warm bodies bending and whispering , stroking your face here at the end when they say the senses of touch and hearing are what remain . <p> The woman who nursed you when you were a two-year-old with pneumonia sixty-odd years ago has come to be with you , hold your handle speak softly about what a fine boy you have always been . We know your story about her and how you 've always been sure she was the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you on a little cot in the upstairs hallway , your siblings in the rooms on either side . Two older brothers in. one room . Two older sisters in the other . There had been another child , a stillbirth the year before you were born , and there were stories of deformities and how it was a life that was never meant to be . You said that as a child you thought often how your partner had died and worried you would share his fate , that your life also was never meant to be . When I picture your childhood bed , your little-boy face from old photos , the corner of a house I remember well though it was torn down a long time ago , I see you , sweaty and shivering , and a young version of this very old woman by your side whispering words of love and kindness . <p> " Oh , honey , " she says , and then turns away from your bed . We all know that she ca n't save you this time . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then said , " I am sixty-four years old , and I have had a good life . " You have not mentioned death since , except to say that you will be sorry to miss all the events in the lives of your grandchildren : recitals , ballgames , graduations , weddings . Jeannie 's son , the oldest at eleven , can not leave your side ; he sits and repeats back to you all the stories you began making up for him when he was barely two . We are surprised he remembers with detail , but he does n't want us to listen . It is a secret he shares with you . You have given each of the grandchildren a secret story or joke at some time or another . They take turns leaning in to kiss you , to whisper , to make you smile . Now you ask that I hold up the baby . " Hold him way up high , " you tell me . " I want to see his whole body . " <p> You were terrified of the water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep , pool edge within reach . This was your metaphor for life . Nearby I dove , an extension of your limbs . I spiraled and flipped , and you held your breath and cheered silently , one hand raised in victory , as I paddled my way back to you . <p> And we fished , hip-deep , waves lapping , surf pulling . You warned me about the undertow , the whirlpools , the stingrays and jellyfish that appeared so benign . And when I caught what we called the toadfish  --  sharp , serrated teeth and spiny , jagged gills-you gave up and simply cut the line from the bloody hook wedged too deep within its mouth to reclaim . " Poor old guy , " you said as he twisted and flopped against the current . " His girlfriend is going to be so disappointed tonight . " You laughed , but I knew from the sadness in your eyes that you understood disappointment better than most . <p> I asked if he was going to live , and you said , " Oh , sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " you said , nudging me with the pun . " But just think of the fish tales he 'll have for his children and grandchildren . He will always be the one that got away . " <p> On your last day , Mom , Jeannie , and I sit by your bed and sing all your favorite songs : " When You 're Smiling , " " I Ca n't Get Started , " " Blue Moon . " You stare vacantly upward , your eyes dry and frozen . " Blink , " we say . " If you can hear us , just blink . " <p> When I went off to college you offered advice . <p> 1 ) If you get a flat , do not stop until you can pull into a well-lit , public place . Drive on the rim if you have to . <p> 2 ) When you go to a party-if you have to go to a party-fix your own drink-if you have to have a drink . Guard and protect it the whole while just as you do yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> 3 ) You are never too old to come home , and it is never too late to call your parents to come and get you . <p> And when I needed to come home , you came to get me . Terrified of flying , you flew , white-knuckled , sweaty . And you worried while we loaded everything I owned-not much-and drove out to the interstate in our rental car . We both smoked then , and that 's what we did all the way home . We played the radio , gave each other an occasional high-five or victory sign , and revved our bodies with enough nicotine to go the whole long distance without stopping for the night . The trunk was crammed with things I had owned most of my life-quilts and books , stuffed animals , and a rusty three-speed bike that had not worked right since it had been stolen and then returned in college . The backseat was filled with forgotten items , some of the wedding gifts still in their original packing-crystal and china and tiny fancy dishes I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistakes , " you said every hour or so . " And you 're young , " you added . " Your whole life is ahead of you . " <p> And now I 'm over forty and soon will give your advice to my own children . I have cans of Fix-a-Flat . I have a jack and a spare , flares , thermal blankets , change for a phone call . I always lock my doors . I do n't get in a car without glancing into the backseat . I do not go shopping at night by myself , even during the holidays when the parking lots are crowded . I only drink beer in the bottle , and I know I am still not too old to call , just that it 's not so easy these days . <p> I 'll tell you something , something you might not remember . It was during a summer vacation at Ocean Drive . Remember the little white cottage where we stayed on the bottom floor several years in a row ? Young boys sold Krispy Kreme doughnuts door-to-door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't even forty then ) body in olive oil and whistled " Red Red Robin " so loud and so often that we all began to exist in that rhythm . There were raft rentals and sno-cones , sand and salt . Jeannie said we should write a note and bury it ; she was nine and I was five . She said she had to do the writing . The note said : " It is 1963 . We are the Miller sisters . We are two kids from Fulton who are visiting South Carolina , and some day when we are very old , we will return to dig this up and remember the day . " She said that when we returned we would drive Cadillac convertibles and live in mansions with handsome husbands . I added that we would have lots of fluffy puppies and kittens , and she said she wrote that part down , too , though I could n't be sure because it was in cursive . You had just told me-in reference to something I did n't remember-that it happened before my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people , like kittens , were born without vision . <p> But what I do remember is a can of red Play-Doh and how we had barely arrived and unpacked when I rolled and pressed the clay into the braided rug of the rental cottage . It got stuck there , a sticky mess , and I got in trouble . I rubbed ice cubes over the spot , rubbing and pulling every little speck . And is n't it odd ? I knew even as I sat there , rubbing and picking , that I would never forget , that I would think of it often . That I would grow up to believe that rectifying a mistake is sometimes reason enough to exist . <p> Your father made his living carving up dead barnyard bodies  --  cows , lambs , pigs . Your child 's eye made no connection between those bloody slabs hanging on hooks and the pet goat you kept in your backyard . You may not have connected the red of your father 's eyes to repossessed furniture and your mother 's sad anger . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love him , so much so that I fell in love with a boy who smelled like him only to realize later that the treasured memory I carried of your father was one of straight bourbon and cigarette gone to ash . <p> When you were late for school , you told the teacher the goat got loose , that you chased him for blocks on end . This was a teacher you adored , the same one who over thirty years later would also teach us , regularly confusing us with Mom , asking with a teasing grin if we were . still sweet on you . The goat was your pet . That part was true . But what you really did on those days you hooked school was wander downtown and shoot pool in a dark , ancient room where you stood and stared out . Your eyes were always drawn to the light . How frightened you must have been the first time you could not find any light at all . The times your heart was so heavy you could not rise from the bed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step forward with their own . Now there are articles and books , more than you could ever read , miraculous medicines that take emotionally paralyzed people and bring them back to life . But not then . Then it seemed you were all alone with your fears and worries : And there were many people willing to let you believe that , to believe that your overwhelming sense of loss and sadness made you less of a man . It changed the way that I looked at a lot of people . Though told to respect my elders , I often did not . It was hard to respect ignorance and harder to respect those who knew better but still offered nothing . <p> You must have seen us standing there those times , children who were afraid to move too far from where you were , even though it was summer beyond the windows of your bedroom and kids from the neighborhood called our names to come out and play tag or hide-and-go-seek , to mount our bikes and take out after the mosquito truck . How shocking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that time and see us there in our Easter dresses waiting for you to come home . We were too young to visit inside , so you came out into the sunlight wearing a light-blue robe and navy terry-cloth slippers . You stayed long enough for us to hug and hold onto you while you repeated how sorry you were , sorry you had to be there . And after you went back inside the tall brick building , one of the adults told me to count up the windows until I got to the fifth floor , that you said you would be there to watch us drive away . I could n't see you-the windows were caged and dark-but we waved anyway . <p> You had bought a card for us in the hospital gift shop , and we opened it in the car . It was a happy card with ducks and bunnies and chickens , a card about love and joy and the birth of spring . It made us sad . The only resurrection I cared about was yours . <p> Animals were my closest friends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wild , skinny strays that I would offer bits of food in hopes of taming . You loved to talk about animals . Your childhood cat , Smoky Mac , once stuck his head in a jar , ears held back in curiosity as his whiskered nose bumped glass . Then he was alert , ears pricked and raised . And he found he could not get loose . He could not get his breath . He ran like wild , heavy jar tight like a helmet , and you , a boy no older than nine or ten , chased after him . You caught his wild body and pinned him down . You cracked the jar with a rock so he could breathe , and though he hissed and scratched , and though he did not come home until the next day , he knew to be grateful . He sat near you whenever he could . He never scratched you or stuck his head in a jar again . <p> When you come home from the hospital this time , we know that it is the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in your own bed , but in one equipped with bars and an IV line , an oxygen tube . We will come to rely on the hospice workers who come and go throughout the day . <p> When you came home that other time , it felt like life was starting again . You were young and had many years ahead of you . There was hope . Your dad arrived in a taxi and sat quietly with his hat on his lap ; he wanted to say things , but he did n't know how . In less than a year , he would not be able to say anything at all , a stroke and throat cancer having left him to stare out at the end of his life . On one of those afternoons , I went with you to visit him in the hospital , but again I was not allowed inside . The adults took turns going in so that someone stayed with me under the huge trees where I fed the squirrels , so fat and friendly that they came and sat right in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read to me , and you said you would , but could we please read something other than The Little Match Girl . But that was the one I wanted ; I wanted to cry . I liked to cry . It had become a kind of hobby , this need to imagine myself or someone I loved taken away . I had to prepare myself . Even now , I feel that 's what I 'm doing-every word , every image is a match struck in an attempt to hold on . <p> On the afternoon you die , we keep asking for a sign , a blink , a twitch . We sing " All of Me , " " Today , " " Moon River . " And when it is finally time , Jeannie and I both know at the same moment . We feel it , a static tension in the air , and we communicate it without words , rushing to get Mom to come in from outside , where she has finally agreed to go for a rest , rushing to bring your brother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your last breath , you blink-one strong blink , and then you are gone . <p> Now I have dreams . One takes place in our old backyard . The swing set casts long-legged shadows toward the house . I pull you up on a swing , tie your arms to the chains to hold you upright . Your head slumps down . You wear the robe of a sick man , and I sit beside you , watching and waiting . I am a kid , my hair cropped short , my knees scabbed , my feet bare . My swing creaks back and forth while yours stays perfectly still . And then the people come . A steady stream of strangers passing , looking , nudging , whispering . You are a sick little girl , they say . Sick to sit and hold onto the dead . <p> But , I say , he 's not . He is not dead . <p> Over and over I argue , and then dusk comes and all the people go away . It is almost dark , and we are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , your eyes a blue-gray I had almost forgotten . You wink . Point your finger and wink . You 're right , you say . I am not dead . <p> Your dad had an old collie he called Bruno , a black-and-white creature he walked to the corner store every afternoon . He was retired , but he still liked the smell of cold cuts . He liked the way the little market still had a floor covered in sawdust and plenty of bones stashed away for Bruno . This is how I remember your father . Small and neat , with a hat he politely tipped at everyone he passed . He held my hand when we crossed the street . His eyes were the same color as yours . This is the man I knew , not the troubled one of your childhood , not the one who stumbled out in front of the bleachers at a high-school football game where you sat in the middle of a warm flock of kids , Mom 's smooth young hand held firmly in your own . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and made your way through the crowd . You never thought to do anything except carry him home . And if this single act were all I ever knew of you , it would be more than enough . <p> Now I dream you are in the mirror , bathrobe loosely tied , arms outstretched . I know with the strange knowledge dreams allow that you can not speak . All the energy you can gather is used to shape your image . And one by one we enter the room . And one by one we ask , Do you see ? In the room there are three of us left to mourn and grieve . In the mirror we are a family of four-a simple image of thousands of days . You sign to us with arms reaching , You , and then , hands pressed firmly to your chest , are my heart . Hands crisscrossing , a shake of the head . That 's all that there is . <p> You actually spoke these very words near the end , when your eyes were still able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are my heart ; that 's all that there is . " And on a later day , nearer the end , your eyes dry and frozen in that distant stare , I leaned in close and whispered , " I 'll be looking for you . " <p>
