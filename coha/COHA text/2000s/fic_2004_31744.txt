Chapter One Wednesday , May 5th The home of Judge George Lawson , Greenwich , Connecticut It took Melody Beecham less than ten seconds to jimmy the lock on Judge Lawson 's study door and slip inside the book-lined room . Not quite a record , but satisfyingly close to her personal best . After six months of field experience with Unit One , she was getting pretty damn good at this breaking and entering stuff , even if she said so herself . Home invasion , burglary , wire tapping and computer hacking were n't exactly the skills she 'd expected to develop into a career when she graduated from the University of Florence with an honors degree in fine arts , but she had to admit that carrying out missions for Unit One had a certain seductive appeal . Sometimes - often enough to be worrisome - she forgot that she was still working under duress and not because she was committed to their goals . Relocking the study door behind her , Melody tucked the electronic pick down the cleavage of her black cocktail dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeweled wristwatch . She directed the narrow beam around the room , checking for anything that did n't conform to the information she 'd been given during her briefing early that morning . Everything looked exactly as she'danticipated . " I 'm in , " she murmured into her mike , crossing to the desk , the sound of her footsteps swallowed by the thick Persian rug . " No surprises . The judge 's laptop is on the desk . I 'm ready to start the download . " Nikolai Anwar responded . " The judge is talking to the governor 's wife and the PR crew is still with them . They 're taking photos . Lots and lots of photos . " Nick 's voice sounded clearly in her ear mike , even though he was at the other end of the house , on the ground floor , where the party to celebrate Judge Lawson 's nomination to the Supreme Court of Connecticut was in full swing . " Go for it , Melody . I estimate you have at least fifteen minutes . " Fifteen minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart was racing as she opened the laptop and waited for the operating system to load . Since Judge Lawson was in the midst of a PR binge , the chances of him walking in on her were slim to none , but there was always an adrenaline rush at this crucial stage of a mission . She drew in a long slow breath , imposing calm . She knew from experience that an adrenaline high could spiral out of control with dangerous swiftness . The moment the judge 's computer was functional , Melody began to download the contents of his hard drive using a high-speed device developed by Unit One 's own technical division . Unit One had accumulated significant intelligence to the effect that Judge Lawson 's verdicts could be bought , despite his golden reputation for integrity . However , his recent appointment to the state supreme court was widely popular and Unit One needed rock-solid evidence before approaching the FBI with their accusations . The fact that Judge Lawson 's verdicts were almost never overturned on appeal made it extra difficult to convince law enforcement authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A wire tap , in operation for the past two weeks , had suggested that concrete proof of his corruption would be obtained if Unit One could get hold of the contents of the judge 's hard drive . Hence tonight 's mission . The laptop buzzed and whirred its way through the download . The screen flashed Melody a message that one more minute was required to complete the transfer of information . She barely had time to heave a sigh of relief before Nick spoke again . " Senator Lewis Cranford is coming upstairs . Judge Lawson just gave him a key , and he 's coming directly to the study . " Nick delivered the bad news with the sort of calm that warned Melody this was a major crisis . During an operation , Nick sounded more tightly controlled the more serious the threat . " Abort the mission , Melody . " His order was low and uninflected , but she could feel his urgency . " Get out of the study - now . " " Get out how ? " She saw that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humming its way through the last vital moments . " If Senator Cranford 's in the hallway , he 's blocking the only possible exit . " " Go out of the window . You need to climb out onto the ledge , Melody . I 'll be waiting to let you into the room next door . " If possible , Nick 's voice became cooler , quieter and even more calm - a sure sign to Melody that full-blown hysterics on her part were distressingly appropriate . He wanted her to climb out onto a window ledge ? In Melody 's opinion , being caught by the senator was a significantly preferable alternative to crawling out onto a narrow slab of concrete , thirty or more feet above ground level . She had many skills useful to an undercover agent , but making like Spider-Man on the side of a building was definitely not one of them . " Melody , get out of there . " Nick 's voice became clipped and she could tell that he was moving fast . " You 're not just compromising yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm leaving now . " The computer burped to a halt . Melody ejected the super-capacity disk , clicked the mouse to shut down the laptop and banged the lid closed . It seemed that the habit of obedience died hard because she ran to the window and pushed it up . Holy God . The ledge could n't be more than six inches wide , and it was drizzling with rain , which meant that it was too narrow and slippery to support a cat , let alone a human being wearing a skimpy satin cocktail dress and evening sandals with two inch heels . " Jesus , Nick , if I 'd wanted to commit suicide I could think of more enjoyable ways than climbing onto this damn ledge . " " Get out , Melody , and that 's an order . " The sound of footsteps approaching down the hallway finally jolted her courage - or her fear - to the point where she could obey Nick 's instructions . Stepping behind the drapes , Melody drew them tightly closed behind her . Then she swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out until she could tuck her feet underneath her body , rest them on the outer ledge and push herself upright . Once vertical , she stretched her arms wide and clung to the ornamental shutters , her body pressed flat against the upper half of the window . Rain splattered on her head and naked shoulders , but as long as she had the minor comfort of solid surface against a portion of her body , she did n't give a damn about getting wet . There was no need to remind herself not to look down , since she was incapable of movement . She 'd escaped just in time , Melody realized as she heard the sounds of a key turning in the lock , followed by footsteps moving around the judge 's study and a dim glow of light seeping out into the darkness . Given that she could see the lights Senator Cranford had switched on , she wondered if the silhouette of her body might be visible to him through the thickly lined drapes . Fortunately she was already so terrified that the prospect of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the overall level of her fear . Nick 's voice spoke into her ear mike . " Melody , do n't answer me because the senator might hear your voice . " ( Continues ... )
