It 's not yet clear whether MARTHA STEWART took up any new crafts , like , say , tattooing , in prison . But during her five-month term at Alderson Federal Prison Camp , W.Va. , she signed on to host two new TV shows , reportedly lost weight and watched her company 's stock soar ( increasing her wealth some $500 million ) . So it was n't totally hard time . Stewart was released on Friday but remains under house arrest at her 153-acre New York estate . Gives a whole new meaning to the term big house .
