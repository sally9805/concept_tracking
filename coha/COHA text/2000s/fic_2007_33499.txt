Prologue The Martyrs Gazing at the white-capped aqua waters of the Mayan Riviera , Ibrahim Jefar struggled to imagine the act that would end his life : the righteous murder , far from home , of the man who led the enemy of his people , the hawk-faced architect of his sister 's shame and grief . Ibrahim and Iyad Hassan , who directed their actions and would join him in death , were living in suspension , awaiting the directives that would transform their anonymity to honor . Their temporary refuge was the village of Akumal , sequestered in a strip of beaches on the east coast of Mexico . Once the area had been peopled by Mayans , whose disappearance had left behind the ruins of pyramids and temples ; now it was the playground of rich foreigners , sport fishermen and snorkelers , drawn by a reef system that offered coral of rich and varied hues and a plethora of vividly colored tropical fish . Their white stucco villa was one of a string of such places , sheltered by coconut palms , built into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To Ibrahim , used to the desolation of his homeland , it was beautiful and alien , as disorienting as the aftershock of a dream . They had existed here for a week . Each morning , as now , stiff breezes drove away the early clouds and exposed a rich blue sky , which met the deeper blue of the ocean . Sunlight summoned forth the slenderwomen in string bikinis who snorkeled and swam and walked on the beach nearby , filling him with desire and shame . He turned from them as he did from the pitiless sun . To Ibrahim , in their heedlessness and privilege , these tourists symbolized those who had shamed his people , the Zionists who used America 's weaponry to occupy their remaining lands and strangle them in a web of settlements and roadblocks , cementing their exile with the glue of poverty . He thought of his sister , sweet and scared , who once had trembled when the bombs fell , before the soldiers drove all reason from her brain ; of his father , whose profitable accounting practice had shriveled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , now possessed by Jews , its beauty known to Ibrahim only through photographs ; of another image , this one of bombed-out wreckage in the refugee camp in Jenin , beneath which lay a corpse whose sole marker was a shattered pair of gold-rimmed glasses . " Terrorist " the Zionists had called him . No , Ibrahim thought -- a martyr , and my friend . But it was Salwa , his sister , who fueled his wavering resolve in this place too far from home . Their journey here had begun in Ramallah , on the West Bank . Using their own passports , they drove to Amman , then flew to Paris , Mexico City , and Cancn . There they had rented a car in Iyad 's true name , driving to the villa selected by the unknown authors of their mission . Ibrahim was unused to this freedom of travel -- a clear highway without checkpoints or soldiers , running for miles in a straight line . They were free here , Ibrahim thought now , a bitter irony . Neither had a criminal record ; both spoke fluent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they said on the few occasions in which they needed to say anything , and then proceeded to do nothing but await their fate in luxury . The conceit of this refuge was that no one with their actual mission would choose such a place : they were rendered inconspicuous by the sheer incongruity of their presence , and the indifference of vacationers bent on their own pleasure and distraction . And so they kept to themselves , unnoticed save by a housekeeper who spoke rudimentary English and did what little cooking and cleaning they required . Their plans , Ibrahim felt certain , were beyond anything that life had led this simple woman to contemplate . The only Jews she had ever known were no doubt rich Americans -- like , by the evidence Ibrahim had sifted from photographs and books , the absentee owners of the villa -- and probably she did not even know what they were . For now , at least , he and Iyad seemed safe . Yet Ibrahim was both frightened and sad . The dream state of this respite made him feel small , the puppet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride of his friends , the admiration of strangers for whom , in death , he would enter into history . But here , in Akumal , this vision lacked the vividness it had had in Ramallah . Instead it seemed somehow juvenile , the fantasy of a boy who had placed himself in an action movie with which he had killed some idle afternoon . Their only contact with reality was Iyad 's cell phone . Ibrahim was not allowed to answer it : Iyad would retreat to a corner of the villa , speaking Arabic in a low voice . His terse comments afterward made Ibrahim feel patronized , a child fed by his parents some rehearsed and edited version of a grown-up conversation held behind closed doors . It was this , he supposed , that made it even harder to imagine Iyad Hassan taking orders from a woman . But this woman , too , was surely only a conduit , the instrument of other men who shared their vision . In the end , they and their faceless masters were all servants of their people , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew , Iyad was finishing his extended prayers -- head bowed , eyes squinting tight , deepening the premature lines of a face too careworn for a man who , at twenty-four , was only two years older than Ibrahim himself . Sometimes Ibrahim believed that Iyad had known everything but doubt . Sometimes he wished that Iyad had not chosen him . He could not envision paradise . He could experience what martyrdom would bring him only in earthly imaginings of the Ramallah that would persist after his death , peopled by ordinary citizens whose pleasure it was to recall Ibrahim 's sacrifice while living out their ordinary lives -- in a land , he could only pray , transformed by his act . He would never know the unborn children who , Iyad had assured him , would feel pride in the mention of his name , study his photograph for the markers of bravery . The pieces of his ruined body would find no grave at home . This place was his oasis , and his prison : he was a hostage to time that dragged with agonizing slowness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . So yet again , he sat on a stone bench atop a rocky ledge where waves struck with a low thud and shot spumes of white into the air , dampening his face and bare chest with a cool mist . The sandy space between the rocks and the villa was thick with palms ; the pounding surf filled the air with a ceaseless watery static . The villa itself was bright and airy , and in the sheltered front garden was a swimming pool . Ibrahim could not imagine that anyone lived like this -- except the Zionist settlers , the red tile roofs of whose houses resembled the roof of this villa , or , he thought with fleeting disdain , the eminences of the Palestinian Authority , once his nominal leaders . But from the evidence of the photographs , this was the home of a bearded American Jew and his skinny wife , grinning maniacally at the camera in a parody of the vacationer 's escapist glee . On their coffee table was a picture book entitled A Day in the Life of Israel , a catalog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with green orchards and bright fruits and vegetables . Still , what Ibrahim saw as he leafed through the pages was his grandfather dying in a refugee camp , a small wizened man with a gaze at once nearsighted and faraway , the look of decades of wretchedness and dispossession . There was no book with a picture of his grandfather , he thought now ; the old man had died as he had lived , seen only by his family . Remembering , Ibrahim felt his eyes mist with grief and anger . The world weeps , he thought , at the death of a Jewish child . But there is no press coverage of dead Palestinians , unless they die killing Jews ; there was no notice of his sister , or the daughter she would never hold , by a media obsessed with Jews blown up in cafs and restaurants by those brave few who chose to emerge from the faceless squalor of their camps , seeking to make their enemy suffer as deeply as did their people . And yet , though Ibrahim respected their courage and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking women and children with him to their doom . He must be grateful that he had been sent to kill a man . This man , the face of Israel . Ibrahim had known that face since childhood , as long as he had known Israeli soldiers and overcrowding and humiliation ; that even dogs , but not Palestinians , were allowed to bark ; that the real terrorists were not only the Jews but the Americans ; that when a Jew dies , the president of the United States weeps in sorrow . He had known all this , and done nothing . Until the day when he looked into the eyes of his sister , now as dull in life as they would someday be in death , and knew that he must redeem his honor . . . Something heavy struck his back . Flinching , he heard the bomb 's percussive pop , stiffened against the explosion that would tear his limbs apart . Then he saw , rolling to a stop , a half-ruined coconut that had dropped from the tree behind him . Wanly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patch of Mexico , with imaginary bombs falling on him from a palm tree . Before the trauma of Salwa , he had laughed more often , even in the worst of times . He wondered if what he saw on Iyad 's face had entered his soul without touching his own unmarked face -- this sense of having felt too much , of a despair deeper and older than his years . On television , at home , he could see beautiful people from all over the world , as free and happy as the half-naked women on the beach at Akumal . But that television set , all he possessed besides a few books and clothes and a college degree from Birzeit without a future he could see , filled him with a sense of his own nothingness . He would sit in his international relations class , furtively admiring Fatin of the light brown eyes and seductive smile , and know that nothing was all he had to offer her . Even this sojourn was a tribute to their facelessness . That they were in Akumal instead of western Mexico @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a fluke of racism and oppression . Self-appointed American vigilantes had begun spending their idle hours patrolling the borders of Arizona and New Mexico , hoping to snare Mexican illegals scurrying across . Those who had planned their mission did not want them caught by some white people 's hunt for brown invaders they could not tell from Arabs . Americans , and Jews . When Iyad had first approached him , he had recited a sermon he had heard from a radical imam . Wherever you are , the holy man had said , kill Jews and Americans . He who straps a suicide belt on his children will be blessed . No Jews believe in peace ; all are liars . Even if some piece of paper is signed by Jews and Palestinian traitors , we can not forget Haifa , or Jericho , or Galilee , all the land and lives the Zionists have stolen from us , the day-by-day degradation into which the occupiers grind our faces . " ' Have no mercy on the Jews , ' " Iyad repeated . " ' No matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews are the sword of the United States of America , the enemy who arms our enemy . ' " This recitation left Ibrahim unmoved . He had heard it all before , countless times ; hearing it again gave him the dull sensation of being rhythmically pounded on the head with a bag of sand . Then he thought of Salwa . . . Once more , Ibrahim flinched . Tensing , he heard the second discordant ring of Iyad 's cell phone , carrying through the screen door of the villa . The ringing stopped abruptly , followed by the sound of Iyad 's voice . Ibrahim closed his eyes . For minutes he was still . Then , with a sense of foreboding , he heard Iyad 's footfalls in the sand , felt his shadow block the sun . Raising his head , Ibrahim looked into his companion 's gaunt face . Then , as before , he thought that God had given Iyad too little skin to cover his bones . " She called , " Iyad said . His monotone had the trace of disdain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he carried out her directives . " This is our last night in paradise on earth . The next will be far better . " Two afternoons later , driven by a lean , cold-eyed man they knew only as Pablo , they rode in a van headed toward the border . Crossing would be no problem , Pablo assured them in surprisingly good English -- thousands did it every day . Although not , Ibrahim thought , for such a reason . Pablo left them a mile from the border . Stepping onto the parched earth , they began to walk in the sweltering heat . Turning , Iyad watched Pablo 's van disappear , then ordered , " We leave the cell phone here . And our passports . Everything that names us . " These few words , Ibrahim found , sealed his sense of foreboding . He emptied his pockets . With the care of a man tending a garden , Iyad buried their passports under a makeshift pile of rocks . An hour later , sweat from their trek coating his face , Ibrahim saw the metallic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ featureless terrain . Ibrahim froze in fear . With preternatural calm , Iyad said , " We 're in America . The home of the brave , the liberators of Iraq . " The van stopped beside them . Silently , its dark-haired young driver opened the door , motioning them into the back . In English as fluent as Pablo 's , he said , " Lie down . I 'm not getting paid to lose you . " To Ibrahim , he looked more Arabic than Hispanic . But then , he realized , so had Pablo . When the man told them to sit up , they were in Brownsville , Texas . He dropped them near a bus terminal with nothing but what he had given them , the key to a locker inside . The terminal was nearly empty . Glancing over his shoulder , Iyad opened the locker . The brown bag they found held a credit card , three thousand dollars in cash , car keys , a binder , two American passports in false names , and California driver 's licenses . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in plastic , and discovered that his new name was Yusuf Akel . " Let 's go , " Iyad murmured in Arabic . Expressionless , he led Ibrahim to a nondescript Ford sedan with California license plates , parked two blocks away . Iyad unlocked the passenger door for Ibrahim . " We have seven days , " Iyad said . " We 'll drive until it 's dark . " It was June , late spring , and the days were long . Tasting the last saliva in his dry mouth , Ibrahim got in , knowing he would not sleep for hours , if at all . Iyad drove in silence . Ibrahim riffled through the binder . It contained a sheaf of maps , detailing a route from Brownsville to San Francisco . On the final map of San Francisco were two stars scrawled with a Magic Marker : one labeled " bus station , " the other beside a place called Fort Point . Closing his eyes against the harsh sunlight , Ibrahim tried to summon an image of San Francisco , the end of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
