Headnote Let the South 's best display of mums inspire you . Paint your garden in the colors of Bellingrath . Just outside of Mobile , Alabama , Bellingrath Gardens and Home delights visitors with eye-popping chrysanthemum displays . Known for its thoughtfully planned borders and brilliantly planted containers , this once humble fishing camp turned public garden is packed with takehome ideas . Attend their fall mum festival in Theodore , and you 'll be inspired to do more than flank the front door with the ubiquitous grocery store pickup . " Due to our mild fall , we have the largest outdoor display of cascading mums in the country , " says executive director Dr. William E. " Bill " Barrick . Most visitors are in awe of these fountains of color that seem to defy gravity by rising miraculously from beds or dripping from bridges and balconies in forms known as standards and cascades . " Meticulously trained for nine months , it 's a true labor of love , " says Bill . Good From Above , Great on the Ground Each year Bellingrath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I note which color combinations work , but more importantly , we pay close attention to what flowers when , " says Barbara Smith , display coordinator and manager . " When the Coast Guard helicopters do a twice over , we know we 've done our job , " she adds with a chuckle . " Bellingrath turns 75 this year , and the gardens have grown chrysanthemums for more than 40 , " says Bill . One learns a lot about a plant in that time and a lot about what visitors expect as well . To satisfy the folks who are counting on blooming chrysanthemums in October , Bellingrath plants the popular early-flowering Belgian Mums , along with others . These free-branching hybrids are loaded with buds , which means more flowers and bolder displays . " Though fall 's shorter days usually trigger mum flowering , " says production manager Chuck Owens , " our warm climate slows that down . We put a lot of energy into picking varieties that are minimally affected by heat delay . " Most of what is sold in garden centers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far to plant what the pros use . " Our color looks great right through Thanksgiving , " says Barbara , " thanks to the later-flowering cascade-type chrysanthemums . " Of Asian origins , these mums are used for training the cascades and standards used in the Bellingrath displays . Plant a Pretty Border Having only one color is never wrong . Teamed with " Autumn Amethyst " Encore Hybrid azaleas , these purple Belgians look elegant . Most gardeners tend to treat chrysanthemums like annuals-tossing them when the season is done . However , if you 've installed enough to edge a bed line as shown here , you may consider using yours like perennials . Once flowering is done , cut plants back to 8 inches . Cool days and short nights may coax a few spring flowers . Pinch several times through the summer , stopping by Labor Day in the Coastal and Lower South , sooner in upper regions . When buds form , flowers should follow . * Keep What You Can Do n't rip out all of your summer annuals when planting for fall . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next to vivid yellow " Parakeet " mums . * Make a Big Impression Some of the cascade mums also make great bedding plants . Perfect en masse , their loose forms can be used to create solid carpets of color . Masters at matching plant with place , the staff has designed one of the prettiest beds near the formal garden , where lavender " Baby Pink " echoes the soothing mood of a nearby water feature . * Try This Look Because it is unexpected , Barbara is particularly fond of a combo along one of the main walks : forsythia sage ( Salvia madrensis ) teamed with later flowering " Perfect Joy ' and " Gum Drop " chrysanthemums . To keep the sage in check , the staff cuts it back by half as late as August so it will be the ideal height of 5 feet tall in November . For cooler regions , we suggest you cut back in late June . Like the mums , this sage appreciates full sun and moist but not wet well-drained soil .
