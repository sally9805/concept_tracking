Rich Gold in Stick Hands Burgundianand English-held France , Upper Loire Valley The Feast of St. Mary Magdalene , July , Year of Grace 1425 Every step Gilles de Rais took toward the shadow of the Burgundians ' castle wall required superhuman effort , the deeds of legend . Over his head hung the portcullis . In an instantunder different circumstancesthe iron teeth would drop with a roar , trapping him on the glory side of the gateisolated from all his friends outside . The great maw did not clamp shut . Gilles pressed on unimpeded by the smoke and dustof a quiet summer 's day in La Charit-sur-Loire . No matter that the attack was only in his mindas yet . Captain Perrinet Grassart was still Burgundian , the enemy , gone over to the side of the invading English . His guards were helmeted and edgy . And the single man following Gilles de Rais was just an unarmed groom , the noble steed a mule slung with strong boxes . Gilles de Rais fully intended to come to La Charit-sur-Loire again someday and receive a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arrows and hot oil were more honest than the false smiles and chivalry he would need today to free his cousin held for ransom in this place . His cousin whom he 'd never seen and knew little about . Arrows and hot oil , he knew how to handle them . They were more honest , even , than the chests of gold coin on the donkey behind him . He memorized every detail of the castle as he passed with an eye to that future day : the discipline of Grassart 's men , their arms . This second gate and portcullis could trap the unwary attacker in its narrow , steep-sided space . It offered no outlet but arrow slits and murder holes so high up , his neck crinked to see them . The defender would rain death down upon the attacker who foolishly let himself get caught here . Once past that snare , the way turned sharply left , exposing the attacker 's sword arm to more arrows , more murder holes . The castle was not newperhaps two hundred years old . Nonetheless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been employed . It gave no consideration to gunpowder , but new construction , widening the base outside and here within , said such consideration was under way . La Charit-sur-Loire would not be easy to take , but Gilles de Rais would take it . After the humilities of this dayand they were only just beginninghe would enjoy taking it . The expressionless helmets of Grassart 's men nodded him across the yard : About twenty horses stabled . Thatched roofs of outbuildings to the south and west , easily fired . A wellthat would make the siege much more difficult . Perhaps there was a source somewhere outside the walls that could be poisoned ? All it would take would be one good , ripe horse carcass . A knowledge of a castle 's underground works was of little use in a siege , even to the sappers ; they rarely got so far . Still , it was a barred window set deep in the ground that next caught the lord of Rais ' eye . A pair of thin , pale sticks waved at him through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of kittens . Gilles took a step or two closer , off his straight line toward the hall , to investigate . Those were n't sticks stripped of bark to the white wood beneath . Those were arms . And they were n't the arms of fighting men Grassart was holding ' til their cousins showed up with their strongboxes . These were children . Peasant children by the rags , though even velvets would have quickly become disgusting in such filth . Braving the incredible stench , stepping yet closer to the dungeon pit , Gilles saw a crowd of them , eight at least , maybe more . It was hard to tell for the shadows , and few seemed strong enough to stand , or tall enough to reach to the window . Light slanting through the bars fell on one child in particular : a boy of eight or so , with the most beautiful pale blond curls , large blue eyes , and skin so thin and papery white , Gilles could see the veins blue beneath it . The boy was whimpering for water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , glad he had n't thrown in a horse carcassyet . He ran for the brink and hefted up a bucketful . He found the bucket chained to the coping . He yanked . He drew his sword and , with no mind for the keen edge he 'd rubbed into it that morning , gave the chain a couple of good whacks . Sparks flew ; nothing else . He even tried the spell for metal Pre Yann had taught him , though he had no time to think of Yann now . Gilles decided he was n't calm enough to work magic . Nothing happened , but he could n't stop for that . At a loss for anything faster to do , he threw aside his sword , cupped his hands , and swept all they could carry , dripping across the yard . There was no thought in his mind but water , as if the thirst were his own . His groom tried to stand in his way , yelling something at him , very pale and nervous . Sight of this man made Gilles remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his chests . He was at the mule instantly , unpacking a morning 's work in an moment . He filled the goblet at the well and carried it to the dungeon grate . The sight of rich gold in that shaking , thin white hand struck him so strongly that he froze , wondering what artist he could hire to capture the pathos of it . Only then did he recall his cousin , Georges de La Trmolle . Only then did he let the warning hand on his arm grow firmer . The little twigs waved the empty goblet at him for more . He took it , but his groom very easily worked his fingers free of the stem . " Come , my lord . Leave it , " the man said , begged . " There 's nothing you can do for them . The fortunes of war . Surely your lordship understands that . " Gilles recovered his senses . The man was right . The moment he 'd drawn his sword against the well , Grassart 's men had drawn theirs against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , these brutes wiped faceless by their visors . In a moment , he 'd be in the dungeon with those children . The idea had appeal to touch that boy 's golden hair . But he had come for cousin Georges . His cousin , his own flesh and bloodalthough he could n't remember having met him beforemust be kept in similar straits or worse . If he broke the gloss of chivalry , gave the enemy any excuse to put him in that dungeon , Gilles de Rais could help nobody , not even himself . With a great sigh , Gilles ' sword found its sheath . He followed where the groom 's arm led him . But he would return to La Charit . By God , by the God , he swore it . Burn the man alive who kept children hostage without food or water in his donjon . And take his gold back again . With usury . Gilles left his nervous groom to guard the coin and the mule and took a broad flight of stairs up into the hall . For a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ air , letting his eyes get used to the dim light barred with shafts of dust . The coo of pigeons came at him , and the thick male stench of a garrison . No woman saw the reeds replaced and freshened . Gilles sniffed like a wolf on the hunt , then picked out two lords sitting across the large space at the high table with a lavish meal spread between them . " Monseigneur the baron of Rais , sire de Laval , and ... no , lord of ... " A young page pressed into service as a herald stumbled on the titles until Gilles brushed the boy aside . The fellow at the table with the greatest presence , that huge , white pork of a man , Gilles decided , must be Grassart , the captain of La Charit . The Burgundian captain 's name had reminded him of the word " grease " since he 'd first heard it less than a week ago : goose liver crammed for the table . Gilles made the man as shallow a bow as he could , forced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I am Gilles , lord of Rais . For the sake of family honor , I 've come to ransom my cousin , Georges de La Trmolle , whom you hold captive here at La Charit . " " Ah , welcome , Gilles , welcome , " the man said , waving greasy fingers toward a chair . Gilles hesitated , taking offense at this familiar use of his given name , yet unsure what he could do about it . Before he could make up his mind either to sit or to draw sword , the man went on . " This is Perrinet Grassart , captain of La Charit . " The greasy fingers indicated the lesser man . With straight , dirty blond hair and loose limbs , he looked nothing so much as like the straw figures peasants set up in their fields at this season . Gilles had already decided he could ignore the man . Taking the castle appeared easier and easier . " My good , generous " The speaker paused in his listing of the commander 's qualities to hum appraisingly. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had done everything in his power to conceal his surprise at this word . " Yes , Gilles , " said the pork . " I am your long-lost cousin , Georges de la Trmolle. "
