Humans may watch animals , but animals also watch humans . The Australian Lyrebird not only observes humans , but from its forest perch , imitates them , as well . It 's been known to make the sound of trains , horns , motors , alarms , and even chainsaws ...  --  Dr. Jerome R. Clade , The Fundamentals of Animal Behavior When you live one and a half blocks away from a zoo like I do , you can hear the baboons screeching after it gets dark . It can scare the crap out of you when you 're not used to it , as I found out one night right after we moved in . I thought a woman was being strangled . I actually screamed , and my mom came running in my room and so did my dad , wearing these hideous boxers with Santas on them , which meant he 'd gotten to the bottom of his underwear drawer . Even Oliver stumbled in , half asleep in his football pajamas , with his eyes squinched from the light my parents flicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : God , Jade . Zoo animals ! Baboons , for Christ 's sake . Mom : I knew we should never have moved to the city . Oliver ( peering at Dad with a dazed expression ) : Is n't it August ? I was told once , though , that we really would have something to fearif there ever were a big earthquake , like they 're always saying is going to happen at any moment here in Seattle . Then we 'd be living in the most dangerous part of the city . See , all the electrical fences are , well , electrical , and so if the power went out for any length of time there 'd be lions and tigers ( and bears , oh my ) running loose , panicked and hungry . You hear a lot of false facts around the zoo  --  you 've got the husbands incorrectly correcting wives ( " No , ha ha . Only the males have tusks , honey " ) , and you 've got those annoying eight-year-olds you can find at nearly any exhibit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ example , and who ca n't wait for the chance to insert their superior knowledge into any overheard conversation ( " Actually , those teeth are his incisors , and they 're used for protection against his greatest enemy , the rufous-beaked snake " ) . But this bit of frightening trivia came from one of the Woodland Park zookeepers , so I knew it was true . That 's one of the reasons I have the live zoo webcam on in my room to begin with , and why I see the boy that day . I do n't mean I keep it on to be on alert for disaster or anything like that , but because I find it calming to watch the elephants . I also take this medicine that sometimes revs me up a little at night , and they 're good company when no one else is awake . Besides , elephants are just cool . They 've got all the range of human emotion , from jealousy and love to rage and depression and playfulness . They have one-night stands and then kick the guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relatives or the people who care for them , and hold a grudge until they get a sincere apology . They are there for each other during all the phases of their lives . A baby is born , and they help it into the world , trumpeting and stamping their feet in celebration . A family member dies , and they bury the body with sticks and then mourn with terrible cries , sometimes returning years later to revisit the bones and touch them lovingly with their trunks . They 're just this group of normally abnormal creatures going through the ups and downs of life with big hearts , mood swings , and huge , swingy-assed togetherness . When we moved into our brick townhouse in Hawthorne Square by the zoo during my first year of high school , I had this plan that I 'd go there every day to watch the gorillas and take notes about their behavior . I 'd notice things no one else had , make some amazing discovery . I had this romantic idea of being Diane Fossey/Jane Goodall/Joy Adamson . I liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outfits with all the pockets , only I did n't really want to live in Africa and be shot by poachers/get malaria/get stabbed to death . Bars between gorillas and me sounded reasonable . I went over to the zoo and brought this little foldout chair Dad used for all of Oliver 's soccer and baseball and basketball games , and I sat and watched the gorillas a few times . The only problem was , it felt more like they were watching me . They gave me the creeps . The male was the worst . His name is Vip , which sounds like some breezy nickname a bunch of Ivy Leaguers might give their jock buddy , but Vip was more like those freaky men you see at the downtown bus stops . The ones who silently watch you walk past and whose eyes you can still feel on you a block later . Vip would hold this stalk of bark in his Naugahyde hand , chewing slowly , keeping his gaze firmly on me . I 'd move , and just his eyes would follow me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't bad enough , Vip was also involved in a tempestuous love triangle . A while back , Vip got gorilla Amanda pregnant , and when she lost the baby , he ditched her for Jumoke . He got her pregnant too , and after Jumoke had the baby , Amanda went nuts and stole it and the authorities had to intervene . It was like a bad episode of All My Primates . So I moved on to the elephants , and as soon as I saw Chai and baby Hansa and Bamboo and Tombi and Flora , I could n't get enough of them . Baby Hansa 's goofy fluff of hair is enough to hook you all by itself . They are all just so peaceful and funny that they get into your heart . When you look in their eyes , you see sweet thoughts . And then there 's Onyx , too , of course . One notched ear , somber face . Always off by herself in a way that makes you feel sad for her . I did n't even need the little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the elephants . I went once a week for a few months , but after a while I got busy with school and it was winter , and so I decided to just watch them from home most of the time . There are two live webcams for the elephants , one inside the elephant house and one in their outdoor environment , so even when the elephants were brought in at night , I could see them . Twenty-four hours a day , the cam is on , for the pachyderm obsessed . I got in the habit of just leaving the screen up when I was n't using my computer to write a paper or to IM my friends . Now I switch back and forth between the cams so I can always see what 's going on , even if the gang is just standing around sleeping . I never did really write anything in my " research notebook " ( how embarrassing  --  I even wrote that on the front ) ; making some great discovery about elephant behavior kind of went in the **26;103;TOOLONG department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a regular part of my life . Watching them is n't always thrilling and action packed , but I do n't care . See , what I really like is that no matter what high-stress thing is going on in my world or in the world as a whole ( Christmas , SATs , natural disasters , plane crashes , having to give a speech and being worried to death I might puke ) , there are the elephants , doing their thing . Just being themselves . Eating , walking around . They are n't having Christmas , or giving a speech , or stressing over horrible things in the news . They 're just having another regular elephant day . Not worrying , only being . That 's why the elephant site is up on my computer right then , when I see the boy . I am stretched out on my bed and the elephants are cruising around on the screen , but I 'm not even really watching them . My room 's on the second floor of our townhouse , and if you lie there and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  this square of glass filled with moving sky , like a cloud lava lamp . Sometimes it 's pink and orange and purples , unreal colors , and other times it 's backlit white cotton candy , and other times it 's just a sea of slow-moving monochrome . I 'm just lying there thinking lazy , hazy cloudlike thoughts when I sit up and the computer catches my eye . The outdoor cam is on , which includes a view of the elephants ' sprawling natural habitat . Chai is there with baby Hansa , and they are both rooting around in a pile of hay . But what I see is a flash of color , red , and I stop , same as a fish stops at the flash of a lure underwater . The red  --  it 's a jacket . A boy 's jacket . When the outdoor cam is on , you can see part of the viewing area , too , and the people walking through it . At first it 's this great big voyeuristic thrill to realize you can see people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are unaware that you 're watching them from your bedroom . There 's probably even some law that the zoo is breaking that they do n't know about . But trust me , the people get boring soon enough . It 's like when you read blogs and you get this snooping-in-diaries kind of rush , until you realize that all they talk about is how they should write more often . People 's patterns of behavior are so predictable . At the zoo , they stay in front of the elephants for about twelve seconds , point to different things , take a photo , move on . The most excitement you get is some kid trying to climb over the fence or couples who are obviously arguing . But this time , the red jacket compels me to watch . And I see this guy , and he has a baby in a backpack . The thing is , he 's young . He ca n't be more than a year or two older than I am , although I 'm pathetic at guessing age , height , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question , in spite of the fact that I 'm usually a neurotic overachiever . So maybe he 's not so young , but I 'm sure he is . And that brings up a bunch of questions : Is he babysitting this kid ? Is it his huge-age-difference brother ? It ca n't be his , can it ? The boy turns sideways so that the baby can see the elephants better . Baby ? Or would you call him a toddler ? I ca n't tell  --  somewhere in between , maybe . The boy is talking to the baby , I can see . The baby looks happy . Here is what I notice . There is an ease between them , a calm , same as with zebras grazing in a herd , or swallows flying in a neat triangle . Nature has given them a rightness with each other . My friend Hannah , who I 've known since I first moved to Seattle , would say I am interested in the boy on the screen only because he 's cute . Hannah , though , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a guy obsession so intense that it transformed her from this reasonable , sane person into a male-seeking missile . God , sorry if this is crude , but she had begun to remind me of those baboons that flaunt their red butts around when they 're in heat . Talking to her lately , it goes like this : Me : How did you do on the test ? I could n't think of anything to write on that second essay question . Hannah : God , Jason Espanero is hot . Me : I do n't think it 's fair to give an essay question based on a footnote no one even read . Hannah : He must work out . Me : I heard on the news that a fiery comet is about to crash into the earth and kill us all sometime this afternoon . Hannah : He 's just got the sweetest ass . It is true that the guy on the screen 's cute  --  tousled , curly brown hair , tall and thin , shy-looking  --  but that 's not what keeps me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his story . It 's The Airport Game : Who are those people in those seats over there ? Why are they going to San Francisco ? Are they married ? She 's reading a poetry book , he 's writing in a journal . Married literature professors ? Writers ? Weekend fling ? The boy does n't take a photo and move on . Already , he is not following a predictable path . He stands there for a long time . The baby wears this blue cloth hat with a brim over his little blond head . The boy leans down over the rail , crosses his arms in front of himself . The baby likes this , pats the boy 's head , though the boy is probably leaning only to relieve the weight of the backpack . The boy watches Hansa and Chai , and then Hansa wanders off . Still , he stands with his arms crossed , staring and thinking . What is on his mind ? His too-youthful marriage ? His nephew/brother on his back ? The college courses he is taking in between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . Arches his back to stretch . I realize I have just done the same , as if I can feel the weight of that backpack . You pass a bunch of people in a day  --  people in their cars , in the grocery store , waiting for their coffee at an espresso stand . You look at apartment buildings and streets , the comings and goings , elevators crawling up and down , and each person has their own story going on right then , with its cast of characters ; they 've got their own frustrations and their happiness and the things they 're looking forward to and dreading . And sometimes you wonder if you 've crossed paths with any of them before without knowing it , or will one day cross their path again . But sometimes , too , you have this little feeling of knowing , this fuzzy , gnawing sense that someone will become a major something in your life . You just know that theirs will be a life you will enter and become part of . I feel that sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and this baby . It is a sense of the significant . He stands and the baby does something that makes me laugh . He grabs a chunk of the boy 's hair in each of his hands , yanks the boy 's head back . Man , that has to hurt . Oh , ouch . But the baby thinks it is a real crack-up , and starts to laugh . He puts his open mouth down to the boy 's head in some baby version of a kiss . The boy 's head is tilted to the sky . He reaches his arms back and unclenches the baby 's fingers from his hair . But once he is free , he keeps his chin pointed up , just keeps staring up above . He watches the backlit cotton candy clouds in a lava-lamp sky , and it is then I am sure this is a story I 'll be part of .
