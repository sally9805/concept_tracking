When you 're out partying , it 's easy to cop a totally carefree attitude . Linda Fairstein , former head of New York City 's Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit , explains why you need to be on guard . // Unexpectedly , Jenna* found herself alone in New York City . The 26-year-old medical technician from Louisiana had spent two weeks on a European vacation with her parents and had arranged to stop over in New York to visit college friends over die long Labor Day weekend before flying home . Jenna did spend several days with her old pals , sightseeing and catching up , but what she had n't realized beforehand was that most of her friends would be heading out of town over the holiday . But since she had use of a friends apartment , she decided to stay through the weekend . Late Saturday evening , Jenna went to one of the downtown neighborhood pubs she had visited during the week . The bartender there knew her friends , and Jenna thought he might look out for her . Sure enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the rocks and introduced her to some of the regulars . When one of the guys she was talking to bought a round of tequila shots , Jenna joined in . The bartender bought the second round of shots . Jenna downed hers and started chatting with a man named Doug , who 'd stopped in for a beer on hiswayhometo Brooklyn . He offered to buy her a beer and she accepted , and they stepped out onto the sidewalk to talk , away from the loud music . Jenna assumed Doug was one of the regulars at the bar , but that was a terrible mistake . As she 'd learn later , no one there had ever seen him before . Throughout my career as the head of Manhattan 's pioneering SexCrimes Prosecution Unit , when I 've asked young women to recount the stories of their assaults , the hours before the attack have frequently included a laundry list of cocktails that resulted in voluntary intoxication . Drinking to excess often led to the inability to remember the evenings events , such as conversation , sexual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that are critical in a criminal investigation . I was saddened to hear one victim say to me , " It 's my right to drink whatever I want , " especially when I hoped to hear instead some recognition of the reality that alcohol abuse can so easily expose women to sexual violence-whether with strangers or colleagues , at home or away . By recounting cases I 've worked on over the years , I 'm going to explain how alcohol can leave you vulnerable to a sexual predator ... and how to avoid becoming a victim . MISSED CUES Doug had asked Jenna if she 'd ever walked across the Brooklyn Bridge at night , and when she explained that this was her first trip to the city , he urged her to come along , promising her the best view of the Manhattan skyline . But he insisted on one more beer for the road before he and an inebriated Jenna walked out of the pub . He kept his arm snugly around Jenna 's waist to steady her on the quiet cobble-stoned side streets of lower Manhattan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto the ground , threatening to kill her if she screamed . He ripped her skirt and stockings and raped her there in the garbage-strewn alley , before escaping with her handbagcontaining all of her identification and money and her cell phone . Jenna , traumatized by the attack and lost in a strange city , staggered around the deserted streets for .1.5 minutes before she was able to flag down a patrol car . Jenna had the foresight to think she 'd be safe in the presence of a bartender who knew her friends , but once she was drunk , that precaution was for naught . In her intoxicated state , she failed to recognize that Doug was plying her with more and more alcohol and none of the other patrons were interacting with him on a familiar level . Worst of all , she did n't notice that he was leading her down a dark , isolated alley . The simple fact is this : Alcohol , more than any other drug , is most closely linked to crimes of sexual violence , according to a 1999 report @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CASA ) at Columbia University . The CASA study found that 38 percent of sex offenders in state prison were under the influence of alcohol at the time of the crime . And in a small percentage of all sexual assaults , only the victim was drinking , as in the next case I 'll describe , which involves a 28-year-old lawyer named Nancy . POWERLESS AND VULNERABLE Nobody wanted to be the first to leave the party , which was still in full swing after midnight in a flower-filled rooftop garden . It was a warm August evening , and the annual end-of-summer event in Manhattan 's trendy SoHo neighborhood had become a favorite of the 50 lawyers who worked together , offering a casual setting in which they could socialize outside an often intense office . Nancy had started the evening sipping cosmopolitans , switched to white wine with dinner , and then had several more glasses of wine while dancing late into the night . She was obviously drunk , so two coworkers , themselves pretty buzzed , encouraged her to have some coffee to sober up before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two men walked Nancy to a busy intersection on Houston Street , where they hailed her a gypsy cab , one of the many taxis cruising Manhattan that are not legally licensed to pick up passengers without prearrangement . One colleague handed the driver $10 , directing him to take Nancy to the train station . Pretty quickly , Nancy passed out in the back of the taxi and remembered nothing about the ride , until she was awakened by the weight of a body on top of her . The driver , who had pulled the car over on a dark side street two blocks south of the train station , was attempting to rape her . Nancy kicked and pushed him , and when he fell onto the floor , she was able to open the rear door , scramble out , and scream for help . I was notified of the attack at 4 a. m. by a phone call from the Special Victims Squad detectives , who had arrested the driver . A Good Samaritan who had come to Nancy 's aid had been alert enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragic is that it often takes an experience like Nancy 's to make smart women like her realize how vulnerable they become when they abuse alcohol . The young lawyer had a long way to travel that night and never should have gotten into a gypsy cab , and the pals watching out for her at the party were so impaired themselves that they could neither gauge her condition nor make a good decision as to how to get her home safely . Nancy was lucky to have escaped without injury , because alcohol also affects a woman 's ability to resist her attacker , by slowing her motor functions and diminishing her mental agility . Furthermore , studies support the conclusion that imbibing alcohol results in the poor communication of sexual cues-and the inability of the victim to interpret them . A classic example of this is the case of a woman named Melanie . In her early 30s and employed by a Silicon Valley computer-software company , she was in New York along with eight coworkers and the company president , attending a convention at a large hotel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tonics there-and was followed by an elegant dinner , featuring white and red wines in succession . Cordials were later served in the hospitality suite , after which the president suggested that all of his employees head to their rooms for a good night 's rest . Melanie 's room was on the same floor as that of a colleague named Dean , so they rode the elevator up together . At her door , he convinced her to let him in for a nightcap . She left him the key to the minibar while she freshened up , and when she came out of the bathroom , he 'd opened a bottle of wine and hung his jacket on the back of a chair . Had Melanie not been so drunk , she may have deduced from these cues that he intended to stay awhile . But instead , oblivious , she kicked off her shoes and sat on the bed , her back resting against the headboard . By the time they 'd gossiped about their colleagues and finished the wine , Melanie was urging Dean to call it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of heading for the door , he tried to embrace her . When she resisted , he pinned her chest down with one arm and ripped at her panty hose with his free hand . The more she tried to fight him , the more belligerent he became . The alcohol weakened Melanie 's ability to coordinate and resist effectively , and while it also prevented Dean from maintaining an erection , he exposed his penis and nibbed it against Melanie 's thighs while she struggled in vain to free herself . As attested by the bruises on Melanie 's wrists and thighs-documented at a hospital the next moming-alcohol use often fuels violent handling of the victim , even when the attacker is an acquaintance . NO MEMORY , NO RECOURSE Then there are the cases in which the victim is so drunk that she ca n't remember any details of the events leading up to the attack-or even the attack itself-and that makes prosecution nearly impossible . One such case : Janet and a group of girls from her dorm attended a frat party together at the University of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two carafes of red wine at dinner , went on to drink beer in the crowded frat-house basement , separating as they socialized . Three of them reconnected at the end of the party , but when they could n't find Janet , they just assumed she had hooked up with someone , so they left to walk home . Although they were aware that their friend had problems with binge drinking ( a Harvard study has shown a correlation between universities that have high rates of binge drinking and those that have a prevalence of sexual assault ) , the trio did n't worry too much about her . After all , she was among her peers at a party of bright college students . But Janet was not okay . She later told her friends that she had become nauseous from all the alcohol she 'd drunk , and a frat brother named Jack had offered his room so she could lie down . She remembered throwing up in his bathroom before going to sleep , fully dressed , on top of Jack 's comforter . It was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes , still feeling disoriented . She was naked , covered with only a sheet , and her clothes were thrown over the back of a chair . Jack was beside her in the narrow bed , also naked . " What happened ? " she asked tearfully , her genital region aching severely . " Did you rape me ? " " What are you talking about ? " Jack said . " We made love several times during the night . You seemed to be enjoying it just as much as I was . " Jack did n't move as Janet crawled to the end of the bed and dressed herself , then ran down the staircase and outside onto the front lawn before breaking down . When she reached the dorm and found her three friends , she tried , unsuccessfully , to reconstruct what had happened to her after she went upstairs with Jack . She told them that everything was " too fuzzy " to recall . " He must have raped me , " Janet said . Janet and her friends should have made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so , and her friends should not have left the party without being certain of Janets condition and whereabouts . Sadly , Janet never reported the rape to campus authorities . She was too ashamed to admit that she had been so intoxicated that she could n't account for any of her conversation with Jack , the kissing and fondling other partygoers witnessed before the pair went upstairs , and the sexual acts that occurred in his bedroom . And even if she 'd reported the rape , she would have had little chance of making a case against him . As I 've told a lot of confused victims : " If you do n't know these facts , the jury certainly ca n't guess them .
