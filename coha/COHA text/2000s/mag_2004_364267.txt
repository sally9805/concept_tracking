JAPAN Mori MORI BUILDING/MORI TRUST Minoru and Akira Mori split up and built successful real estate companies on their own . One brother now talks of building Utopia , while the other is content to just build 2003 Revenues : $2.25 billion <P> Minoru Mori , Tokyo 's most powerful property tycoon and a leading member of Japan 's most prominent real estate  --  development family , fancies himself to be something of a philosopher-builder . Sitting in a leather armchair behind a gigantic marble conference table at his company headquarters , the 69-year-old president and CEO of Mori Building grandiloquently expounds upon his vision : Buildings are not just business ventures or structures where people live and work but also opportunities for social betterment . His goal , he says , is to revolutionize the way his countrymen live by creating high-rise , inner-city communities that do away with the infamous Tokyo commute and free up more leisure time . At stake , he says , is nothing less than the city 's international competitiveness and its citizens ' happiness . <P> His brother Akira has no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward more modest , financially conservative projects . Rather than squabbling unproductively , the brothers parted ways in 1999 , splitting the family empire into Minoru 's Mori Building ( with $1.3 billion in sales and 122 buildings under management ) and Akira 's Mori Trust ( $949 million in sales and 68 buildings under management ) . " A boat ca n't have two captains , " Akira says . <P> Intellectualism , whether focused on art or commerce , is a defining characteristic of the Mori clan . Minoru and Akira 's father Taikichiro Mori , the founder of what is now Mori Building , was originally a professor of business in Yokohama , Japan . But seeing how land prices had fallen to absurdly low levels after World War II , Taikichiro began buying lots in central Tokyo , where the family had been tobacconists and rice merchants for generations . With the assistance of his second son , Minoru , and third son , Akira , now 67 , Taikichiro built Mori Building into one of Japan 's most successful real estate  --  management companies . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professors . ) Fueled by the great Japanese asset bubble of the 1980s , Taikichiro reigned as the richest man in the world in 1991 and ' 92 , according to Forbes . <P> Following Taikichiro 's death in 1993 , however , a rift arose in the house of Mori . Minoru and Akira harbored conflicting strategic visions . Minoru favored bold urban re-engineering , as demonstrated not only by his Roppongi Hills mini-city in Tokyo but also a project in Shanghai to build the world 's tallest building . From anyone else , that might seem like delusional self-aggrandizement , but Mori actually has the muscle to put some mortar behind his message . Take the $2.25 billion , 27-acre Roppongi Hills . The project , which opened 12 months ago , was carved from more than 400 smaller building lots that Mori systematically pieced together over 14 years . It features a 54-story office tower and 793 apartments , integrated with shops , restaurants , parks and gardens .                    @
