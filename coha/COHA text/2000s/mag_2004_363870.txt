David Chase , creator of HBO 's The Sopranos , has sworn up and down that Season 6 , the season after this one , will be the show 's last . Chase says he does n't want the show to repeat itself . And the gracious thing would be to start the countdown , admire his artistic integrity and thank him for the memories . <P> But on behalf of those who are greedy and not gracious , let me remind Mr. Chase that he is making a freaking TV show . TV repeats itself  --  that 's what it 's for . Bad shows do it badly , and great shows like The Sopranos do it so well that you hardly notice . Every season , New Jersey Mob boss Tony Soprano ( James Gandolfini ) outwits his rivals and deceives his family , friends and therapist , all while remaining oblivious to his failings . His marriage to Carmela ( Edie Falco ) unravels as he chases anything with legs and hair spray and she pursues sad , unconsummated flirtations . Mobsters from the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feds circle but never manage to bust Tony . People die in drolly creative ways . And when the season is over after three months , we pray for the next year or so until the next episode to pass quickly . <P> The first four episodes of Season 5 ( Sundays , 9 p.m . E.T. ; premieres March 7 ) find The Sopranos as strong as ever . As always , it opens with a shot of the newspaper on the Sopranos ' driveway  --  except that Tony is n't around to pick it up , having separated from Carmela in the incendiary Season 4 finale . He 's living in the house that belonged to his deceased , emasculating mother ( on The Sopranos , you can never escape your family history ) . Carmela 's at casa Soprano with an angry teenage son  --  and a wild black bear invading the backyard , a menacing inversion of the family of ducks that settled in the pool in Season 1 , precipitating Tony 's first panic attack and trip to therapy . ( Hammering home the metaphor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feed the ducks has gone bad , attracting the intruder . ) <P> The new episodes , however , will probably please those who complained that Season 4 overemphasized domestic drama  --  rather than Mob stories , the show 's popcorn hook  --  and lacked focus . None have the Edward Albee gut wallop of last season 's climax , but they are more consistent and action heavy . A bunch of mobsters arrested in the ' 80s get paroled ( " The Class of ' 04 , " the media dub them ) , including Tony Blundetto ( Steve Buscemi ) , who went to jail for a heist Tony Soprano was supposed to be on . Determined to go straight , " Tony B. " is driving a linen-delivery truck while working to become a licensed massage therapist . It sounds like comic relief , and in a way it is , but Tony B. , clinging to his modest dream , is also a poignant figure , Tony Soprano 's sad-sack but decent alter ego . <P> The Sopranos ' comedy is inseparable from its drama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Uncle Junior " ( Dominic Chianese ) begins showing signs of senility  --  after faking it to avoid jail . Watching TV , he lands on HBO 's Curb Your Enthusiasm and looks uneasily at the similarly bald , skinny Larry David . " What the f ? " he asks . " Why am I on there ? " ( Imagine if HBO had been airing The Sopranos . ) Chianese is just one example of the show 's bench strength , and he gives his best performance yet as he drives to Newark and gets lost looking for his long-dead brother .
