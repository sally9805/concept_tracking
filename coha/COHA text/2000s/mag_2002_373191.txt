Even if she had actually visited the 2-year-old 's central Florida home on July 1 , child-welfare caseworker Erica Jones would not have found little Alfredo Montez . He was being beaten to death in a mobile home 10 miles away , allegedly by his baby-sitter , Richard Chouquer , 23 , as punishment for soiling his pants . The child was then wrapped in a bedspread , one with characters from Disney 's 101 Dalmatians , and allegedly thrown into the trunk of Chouquer 's gray Ford Taurus . Police say that as Chouquer and his girlfriend , Amandy Lawrence , 22 , drove off to find a spot to dump Alfredo 's body , they took the little boy 's sister Rheyna , 4 , along for the ride . The caseworker knew nothing about that . She was nowhere near to stop it . <P> But Jones is accused of a lie that has put her at the center of the latest crisis in Florida 's Department of Children and Families ( DCF )  --  and , by extension , the re-election campaign of Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to check on Alfredo and Rheyna that same day in response to reports from neighbors of abuse that had left the children with welts and bruises . She never went , perhaps because she had been on the job less than a year , was eight months pregnant and was overwhelmed by a case load of 50 children on a $28,000 salary . Yet when news circulated on July 9 that Alfredo was missing , Jones allegedly falsified the case records to show that she had visited the children 's home on July 1 , scribbling into the report that Alfredo looked " happy . " Alfredo 's corpse was found in a ditch north of Tampa nearly two weeks later . Jones was not only fired but also charged with felony fraud under a new state law . Jones ' supervisor was also fired . <P> The law is so new  --  and the scandal that inspired it still so fresh in the public 's memory  --  that its violation has put the Governor on the defensive , even though it was Bush who pushed the measure through the legislature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the DCF 's last debacle : the case of the still vanished 5-year-old Rilya Wilson , who was missing for 15 months before her caseworkers realized it in April . Rilya 's caseworkers also fudged reports and lied about visits that never took place . <P> The Governor had promised four years ago to fix the state 's child-welfare mess . But even though Bush oversaw a 27% increase in child-protection funding , 60 children who had previous contact with the state 's child-welfare system died of abuse or neglect in 1999 and 2000 , and as many as 1,000 were unaccounted for . Bush 's Democratic challenger , former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno , who is lagging in the polls , was quick to use the tragedy against Bush . The murder , she says , " certainly indicates that Rilya Wilson 's case was not an isolated incident . There is simply too much at stake to stay our current course . " Says Democratic state representative Frederica Wilson , who is pressing Bush to open a grand jury investigation into the DCF 's disasters : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this , he 's going to look clueless and heartless come fall . " <P> Bush called the tragedy " heartbreaking . " The public 's immediate wrath will probably focus on Bush 's handpicked DCF chief , Kathleen Kearney . Critics have called for her head since April , saying she focuses too much on whisking kids into foster care and too little on repairing her agency 's bureaucracy . Kearney insists that cases like Jones ' " are not widespread . "
