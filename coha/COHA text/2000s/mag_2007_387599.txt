. Calming advice on your biggest baby worries . When my first daughter , Sadie , was a few days old , we had n't mastered breastfeeding , and I was sure I was starving her . But after a few panicked calls to the doctor and a few weigh-ins , it became clear that she was n't starving at all  --  she was thriving . Most new moms have some frantic  --  but largely unfounded  --  fears about their baby 's health . " You realize that you hold the life of this tiny being in your hands , and you have no idea how to care for it , despite having read six child-rearing books , " says pediatrician Ari Brown , M.D. , author of Baby 411 . " And you 're so tired and full of hormones that anything can cause uncontrollable weeping . " No wonder we occasionally blow things out of proportion ! You can relax . Here , moms ' top baby worries , and why you can put them to rest right now : " Will my baby stop breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on her baby 's stomach to make sure he was breathing . When her hand cramped up , the Miami mom stuck her finger under his nose to feel the air come out . Do n't sweat it : " Babies breathe unevenly because their respiratory systems ca n't regulate themselves yet , " says Charles Shubin , M.D. , director of the Children 's Health Center at Mercy FamilyCare in Baltimore . " It 's absolutely normal . " By age 2 or so , kids breathe more regularly . Chances are slim that your child would stop breathing without an obvious reason , like bedding over his face , especially if you follow sudden infant death syndrome ( SIDS ) prevention guidelines , such as back sleeping for the first year . But if your baby 's face or lips turn blue , call 911 , and if you know how , administer infant CPR . ( For CPR classes near you , visit **30;2375;TOOLONG . ) " Am I letting my baby cry too much ? " Chrissy Dye of Cedar Grove , New Jersey , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son 's nighttime insomnia . But on the first night , Will , now 5 , bawled for an hour and a half straight . " I was worried that so much crying could hurt him , " she says . Do n't sweat it:The amount of crying babies can tolerate varies by age . Newborns cry to communicate their needs , so it 's best to respond to their signals promptly . Despite all your swaddling , singing , and swaying , however , they may still sob for about three hours over the course of a day , and that 's okay . The time for concern is when a single crying jag lasts more than an hour . In that case , call the doctor because there could be a physical cause , such as an intestinal obstruction or a scratched cornea . By 6 months , most babies can soothe themselves , so it 's fine to let them wail for a few minutes while you finish your shower or cooking dinner . The same holds true for babies over 5 months who are being sleep trained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go . It 's harmless , says Dr. Brown , and wo n't cause your baby any psychological damage ( however awful it sounds ) . " My baby spits everything up  --  he must have stomach problems ! " Burp cloths were a must-have for Amy Schrader of New York City after her son Max , now 3 , was born . She was so worried about his spitup habit that she convinced her pediatrician to put him on Zantac , a medication for acid reflux , even though the doctor reassured her that her baby was fine . Do n't sweat it:Babies have an immature esophagus , meaning that what goes down is very likely to come back up , especially liquids . Breast milk and formula are n't acidic , so it 's typically not uncomfortable . But if your baby often cries , arches her back , or just looks distressed , it may mean irritating stomach juices are coming up , and a prescription for an antacid medication such as Zantac can help . Spitup may also be just a " wet burp "  --  when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be vomit , caused by kids taking in more than they can hold , in which case you should consult your doctor . Whatever the reason , it 's probably not dangerous . " Am I stimulating my baby enough ? " These days , with classes in movement , creative play , art , and music open even to 8-month-olds , it 's easy to wonder if you 're doing enough to advance your child . Colorado Springs mother Debby Clarke , who opted out of extracurriculars with daughter India , now 6 , used to think , " Oh God , will she be stupid because I do n't even do sign language with her ? " Do n't sweat it:There 's no need to break the bank on infant programs when your baby 's favorite source of entertainment is you . " Even a trip to the supermarket is a learning adventure , " says Dr. Brown . In fact , your baby needs unstructured play more than a schedule jam-packed with classes and activities . " From four months , babies can manipulate objects to see their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What happens if I pull this ? " Dr. Brown says . These seemingly simple moves are enough to stimulate intellectual curiosity and teach them to entertain themselves . " What if my baby chokes ? " " I became known as the choke-hazard queen when my daughter Sophie , now 2 , was born , " says Marguerite Bellwoar of Glastonbury , Connecticut . Even though Bellwoar had been through that stage with her older son , Jake , now 6 , Sophie 's love of putting things in her mouth was alarming . " I had Jake trained to spot something dangerous from twenty feet away . " Do n't sweat it:Normal , healthy babies have a strong gag reflex that protects their airway when they choke , so the offending particle is coughed up or swallowed and not inhaled into the lungs . Of course , things can get lodged in a baby 's throat occasionally . Be sure to keep anything smaller than the diameter of a toilet paper roll out of your baby 's reach . In the very unlikely event that your child chokes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face turns red or purple and/or he 's not making any sounds  --  here 's what to do : * Use " back blows . " Put your baby facedown on your forearm and give him four swift blows between his shoulder blades with the palm of your hand . * If you can see the object , you can go in after it.If you ca n't , do n't do a " blind sweep " with your fingers to fish it out  --  you can end up shoving the object farther back into the throat . " I 'm starving my baby ! " " Nothing my friends , family , or pediatrician said could make me believe Olivia was getting enough to eat , " says Jennifer Stevenson of Chicago , who had trouble breast-feeding her infant daughter . Do n't sweat it : " Most babies get enough milk from their mother 's breasts , " says pediatrician Philip Manley , M.D. , of the Children 's Hospital at Greenville Hospital System University Medical Center in South Carolina . Clues that a baby is getting her fill : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes on each breast about eight times a day , swallows audibly , and sleeps well afterward . She 'll probably also wet at least six diapers daily by one week of age . While babies do often lose weight in the first week , they 'll typically gain it back by the end of the second . And if yours is losing too much weight , or not gaining it fast enough , the pediatrician should catch it at your regular checkups . Same goes once she starts on solids . Babies can be ravenous some days and peckish on others . They can also be picky about trying new foods . The process is gradual , but chances are your baby 's getting enough to eat over the long haul . If she 's not , your doctor will let you know . That said , babies do occasionally get dehydrated , especially if your milk is delayed in coming in . Call the doctor if you see the signs , which include excessive sleepiness ; poor sucking reflex ; fewer than six wet diapers a day ; dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But do n't panic . " If you recognize the symptoms quickly , dehydration is easily treated , " says Dr. Manley . " My baby 's poop is too hard/too watery/a weird color ! " Sarah Wolman of Montclair , New Jersey , was distressed to find " electric-green poop " in 3-month-old Sam 's diaper  --  since she breastfed him , she thought it must be something she was eating , but she could n't tell what . Do n't sweat it:There 's a wide range of what 's normal when it comes to poop , and it varies partly by age . Newborn poo ( called meconium ) is greenish black , then changes to yellow within a month and stays that way for a few months . If you 're breastfeeding , your baby 's poop can be green . Newborn breastfeeders may have a stool after every time they eat , while bottle-feeders may go only once a day . For babies older than a month , it 's normal to go anywhere from four times a day to once a week . What 's important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicate constipation , nor very watery , which could be diarrhea . ( Diarrhea is frequent watery stool  --  up to ten liquid diapers in one morning . ) Give rock-hard poopers extra fluids . If you suspect diarrhea , call the pediatrician ; your baby may need an electrolyte solution to replace lost fluids , especially if he 's vomiting . Always call the doctor if you see blood in your baby 's diaper . ( It 's probably just a minor tear of the anal tissue , but it 's best to check it out . ) " We ca n't leave the house  --  she 'll get sick ! " Pam Hansell of Levittown , Pennsylvania , was so nervous about taking her newborn daughter out in public that for the first six weeks , their only outings were to the pediatrician 's office . " I was afraid she 'd catch a cold , " says Hansell . Do n't sweat it:It 's perfectly safe to take a healthy newborn out of the house as soon as you 're ready . " Babies are born with protective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of life , " says Dr. Manley . Still , it 's wise to avoid super-crowded areas  --  like the mall on a Saturday afternoon  --  and people who are sick . Also , wash hands frequently , since they 're germ hot spots for babies ( and adults ) . " My baby has a developmental delay  --  he 's not crawling/walking/talking yet ! " When all his friends were toddling , Chrissy Dye 's son , Will , was content to crawl  --  even at 17 months . Do n't sweat it : " There are average ages for developmental milestones , but every kid is different , " says Dr. Shubin . And in the long run , the timing is inconsequential . " How soon they walk or talk is n't a good marker for how well they 'll do later in life . " Some babies do n't walk right away because crawling gets them around fine . Other kids skip crawling altogether and become champion walkers . There are landmarks to help you determine whether your child 's verbal and motor skills are on track @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your doctor . But your own instinct is often your best guide . While Dye was concerned about Will , her gut told her he was just taking his time . Sure enough , at 18 months , Will finally started walking !
