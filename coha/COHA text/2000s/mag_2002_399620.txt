// The house was quiet . As quiet as death , thought Charlie Drew ; then he immediately tried to force the thought from his mind . The quietness , the tip-toeing about , the whispered conversations-it was all becoming unbearable-while upstairs his younger sister Elsa lay ill with influenza . Less than a week after she became ill , Elsa died . The family was griefstricken . Fourteen-year-old Charles Richard Drew had his first serious thoughts about making medicine his life 's career . Up until then , sports had been the motivating force in his life . He had won his first athletic competition-a swimming race-at the age of eight , and had participated in every sport open to him from then on . After two years of teaching and directing athletics at Morgan College in Baltimore , Maryland , he entered medical school at McGill University in Montreal , Canada . While attending McGill he became good friends with Dr. John Beattie , a British instructor . One day Dr. Beattie delivered a lecture on blood structure and blood groups , and encouraged by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he received a two-year fellowship in surgery at Presbyterian Hospital in New York , his special project was to determine how blood could be preserved and used for transfusion . He discovered that if blood were refrigerated at a certain temperature immediately after being taken , it could be kept for as long as two weeks . He submitted a detailed plan for setting up a blood bank at the hospital , and money was voted for a four-month experiment . The program started with his staff donating blood . Volunteers were encouraged , and all blood types were kept on hand . The project became a permanent part of the hospital . // In 1940 , Columbia University awarded Drew his Doctor of Science degree . His thesis for the degree summarized his work at Presbyterian Hospital and was titled " Banked Blood . " // Dr. Drew 's experiments showed that blood kept for more than two weeks started to deteriorate , and he would not use it for transfusion . He discovered that plasma could be given to any patient regardless of blood type . Soon lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. Drew then experimented with extracting the water from plasma so that the dried plasma could be preserved over a much longer period and could be shipped greater distances . When needed , the dried crystals could be mixed with water , much as we mix soft drinks from powders . At the beginning of World War II , Dr. Beattie , Drew 's former instructor at McGill , sent him an urgent cablegram . " Could you secure 5,000 ampules of dried plasma for transfusion ? " it said . " Follow this by equal quantity in three to four weeks . " Dr. Drew was stunned . He knew that there was no such amount of plasma in the whole world . But he never hesitated . He immediately set to work and organized the " Blood for Britain " campaign . Countless lives were saved because of it . The following year the American Red Cross asked Dr. Drew to set up a blood procurement program to aid American soldiers injured on the battlefield . Now Dr. Drew faced a new problem . Some Americans demanded that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for blacks . A controversy arose and when journalists asked Dr. Drew for a statement , he told them that no difference in the blood could be discerned in the laboratory that would cause a need for such a practice . Drew received the Spingarn Medal in 1943 for the " highest and noblest achievement by a black American during the preceding war . " In April 1950 , Dr. Drew left Washington with three other doctors for a conference at Tuskegee Institute in Alabama . His car overturned near Burlington , North Carolina . Seriously injured , he lay badly in need of a blood transfusion and died at the age of 45 , en route to a hospital . // <p>
