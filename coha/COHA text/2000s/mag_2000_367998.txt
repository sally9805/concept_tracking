This remastered edition of a 1955 recording session captures the great Armstrong at his mature best ; his trumpet virtuosity and singing were never more supple or expressive . Along with the nine Fats Waller gems from the original LP , the CD offers four alternate takes from that session and seven tracks of Armstrong 's older Waller recordings . Satch dazzles with familiar songs like Honeysuckle Rose and Ai n't Misbehavin ' , but his playing and singing of the lesser-known lament Blue Turning Grey Over You are staggering and unforgettable . <P>  --  By Elliot Ravetz
