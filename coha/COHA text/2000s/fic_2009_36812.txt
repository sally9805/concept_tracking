A bigail Foster stared through the windshield at the expired parking meter . Her fingers strangled the steering wheel , knuckles blanching , hands beginning to cramp . This had all seemed like such a good idea a month ago back in New York when she 'd pitched the article to Margot , her editor at Great Outdoors . Now , on the verge of seeing him for the first time in twenty-six years , she realized she 'd done herself the disservice of glossing over this moment and the fact that she 'd have to walk into that building and face him . <p> Her watch showed five minutes to seven , which meant it was five to five , mountain time . She 'd sat in this parking space for twenty minutes , and he was probably about to leave , thinking she 'd decided not to come . <p> The hostess showed her toward the back of the brewpub , which at five in the afternoon stood mostly empty . Peanut shells littered the floor , crunching beneath the heels of her black pumps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a yeasty sourness . The hostess held the back door open and motioned to the only occupied table on the patio . <p> Abigail stepped outside , smoothed the Cavalli skirt she 'd paid way too much for last year in Milan . <p> The doubt resurfaced . She should n't have come . No story was worth this . <p> He sat alone with his back to her at a west-facing table , with the town of Durango , Colorado , spread out before him in its high valley , specked with the icy yellows of cottonwood and aspen , enclosed by pine-wooded hills and bare shale hills and , farther back , the spruce forests and jagged peaks of the San Juans . <p> The sound of the patio door banging shut caught his attention . He looked over his shoulder , and at the sight of her , slid his chair back from the table and stood  --  tall , sturdy , wavy silver hair , dark blues , and dressed like something out of Backpacker magazine  --  plaid Patagonia button-up shirt tucked into a comfortable pair of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that knot constricting in her stomach again , noticed his left hand trembling . He seized the chair he 'd been sitting in to steady it . <p> " Hi , Lawrence . " <p> She knew he was fifty-two , but he 'd aged even better than his photo on the history department 's Web site indicated . <p> No handshake , no hug , just five seconds of what Abigail ranked as the most excruciating eye contact she 'd ever held . <p> Easing down into a chair , she counted three empty pints on the table , wished she 'd had the benefit of alcohol to steel herself for this meeting . <p> She rifled through her purse , found her sunglasses . It was Halloween , and though the air carried a chill , at this elevation the intensity of direct sunlight made it pleasant to sit outdoors . <p> " I 'm glad you came , " Lawrence said . <p> A waiter costumed as a hula dancer approached the table . <p> " Want a beer , Abigail ? " <p> " Sure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I do n't care . Something light . " <p> He said to the waiter , " Bring her a Rock Hopped Pale . " <p> " Right on . " <p> The whistle of a steam-powered locomotive blew somewhere up the valley . Abigail saw the plume of smoke in the distance , heard the chugging palpitations of the valve gears as the train steamed south through the heart of town . <p> " I do n't have any backpacking gear , " she said . <p> " Scott will outfit you . " <p> " Who 's Scott ? " <p> " Our guide . " <p> The silence , uncomfortable as it came , crawled under her skin . <p> " Pretty town you have here . " <p> She could n't help thinking this did n't feel anything like she 'd imagined it would . Having run countless versions of this moment through her head , they 'd all carried more gravitas . She would scream at him . She 'd hit him . They 'd break down and cry together . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she understood none of that would happen . They were just two people sharing a table , trying to limp through the awkwardness . <p> " I 'm curious , " she said . " All this time , and now you contact me . " <p> " I 've followed your journalism career , subscribe to all the magazines you regularly contribute to , and I thought this . . . expedition . . . might be good fodder for your  --  " <p> " But you have n't been interested in helping me since I was four years old . " <p> Lawrence slugged back the rest of his dark beer , stared at the mountains , wiped the foam from his beard . <p> Abigail said , " That came out more angry than  --  " <p> " No , it 's fine . You 've got standing to be as angry as you want . " <p> " I 'm not , though . " <p> The patio door opened and the waiter returned with Abigail 's pint and another round for Lawrence . <p> When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lawrence , " she said , " here 's to our past . Fuck it . " <p> He grinned . " That easy , huh ? " <p> " We can pretend . " <p> They clinked pints and Abigail sipped her golden beer . <p> " So why 'd you come ? " Lawrence asked . " To be honest , I never expected a response to that E-mail . " <p> " Funny , I was just sitting out in the car , building the nerve to walk in here , and trying to answer that question for myself . " <p> The sun ducked behind the mountains and Abigail shivered , the rocky slopes and snowfields blushing with alpenglow . <p> Excerpted from ABANDON by BLAKE CROUCH Copyright 2009 by Blake Crouch Published in July 2009 by St. Martin
