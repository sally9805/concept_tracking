Chapter One His ability to put tasks in sequence was the first thing to go . William Stanley Sabert , the former congressman , ambled into the kitchen , carrying in his good hand , the left one , a glass tumbler . With the weaker hand , the only partially recovered right , he pressed a sheaf of papers to his ribs , but not carefully enough : his attention slipped and then the papers slipped , they fluttered to the floor . Pick them up , he told himself . He could not . Certain capillaries in his brain had gone dry ; they dangled like shrunken empty gloves . He could n't pick up the legal-pad pages he 'd covered with notes or the hearing transcripts or-where did that come from ? - the Christmas card that slid out from the sprawl . The notion of retrieving all of it loomed and then faded , as showers of tiny particles , boluses , bits and pieces of the midbrain clot that had just exploded inside his head , infiltrated the network of his vessels . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first he would have had to put the drinking glass down . He would have had to lean over . He would have had to reach for the papers and clasp them with his good hand . The sequence of steps had escaped him . It was his third stroke , though , and he did have an idea of the enemy . He fought back . He 'd come into the kitchen to fix something to eat . He intended to do that . No matter that making a sandwich was a more complex task than fetching the papers that had fallen . He opened the refrigerator and set his drinking glass on the top shelf next to the orange juice . He closed the refrigerator . He took a bag of English muffins from the breadbox , pulled open the oven door , and placed the bag inside the oven . Next , tuna fish-but as he straightened himself Sabert saw only color , throbbing reds and greens . When the room returned , pale and blurry , his eyes were flooded . He touched his sleeve to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and flakes of cereal lurked under the cabinets ; mice lived in the breadbox . And that was just the kitchen . There were also the hairs clouding the bathroom floor , the towels heaped in a corner , the bottle of chardonnay forgotten in the toilet tank . A shelf in the bedroom closet had collapsed , and a hail of campaign buttons and umbrellas and old photographs and the silver serving forks from his first marriage ( Delia had taken the spoons ) had landed among shoes and old pine inserts . For all his storied acuity , his talent for clarification , for cutting through legislative knots in a few incisive strokes , Will Sabert had always been a force of entropy . And now these papers spilled across the linoleum . He 'd collected them to show the reporter , to help explain the work that had engaged him over the past year . What a relief , a pleasure , to have stumbled upon such a project , one that gave shape to his solitary days . High time he revealed it to someone . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that end many weeks of research , quite a lot of sorting through precedent and records of international tribunals . A method to end all wars , this was , entailing minimal adjustments to current statutes and treaty agreements . He had condensed the argument in favor of it , that is to say the argument for ending war , to a simple , watertight petition that could be understood by any high school student . It was clear , after all , that the wars of the twentieth century had been unjust , unnecessary , and , without question , inefficient from the point of view of costs . He 'd hoped to live long enough to expand his premise into a book , but lately he 'd begun to fear otherwise . Hence his plan to go over it all with the reporter . There was some doubt in his mind , though , as to whether the reporter had already come and gone . The first stroke had been almost twenty years earlier : a tingling on the way to the cafeteria , and by the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had gone numb . He pretended to have lost his appetite . By later that afternoon he was back to normal . He went on working just as before . The next one had followed his retirement . A headache , unlike any headache he 'd ever had . Icicles splitting his skull into pieces . A trip to the hospital , a poor prognosis . That time his whole right side crumpled , and proper names hid themselves . He could say the words son and daughter but the names of his own children would n't give themselves up . Now his mind was beset by a cascade , a closet shelf falling , an avalanche of old possessions . His children , his mother , his first bicycle , his dog . The fountain he and his brother had ridden their bicycles to on the terraced grounds of the state Capitol , a fountain long since bulldozed to make way for office buildings and parking garages . Its water had spouted from pink gargoyles ' mouths : there , one terrible hot day when he was ten or eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaches had taken a swing at Will , after Will had called him a capitalist . He dodged the punch . His little brother Robbie had gotten it instead . Smacked in the face . Bloody nose . Scared to fight , Will had grabbed Robbie 's arm and run away . This was his last memory . No one was there to see the former congressman back up against the countertop and slide down the cabinet face . His shirt caught against a drawer pull and tore ; his hip fractured ; his great old moppy head fell to one side and was still . Chapter Two The ballroom was packed and anxious . As usual there were no windows . Swags of royal-blue bunting hung above a long dais , and tacked to the bunting was a banner , red with white lettering . HARDAWAY , it read . More words below , something-something VALUES ! - but Nick could n't see the first two words for all the heads and waving arms in front of him . A cheerful crowd of the neat and tidy had filled the hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the television lights . People scanned the room , signaling one another with raised hands and open mouths . Nick did not wave , nor did anyone wave to him . Having been swept up by a current pressing toward the coffee urns , he was floundering in an eddy of middle-aged women wearing scarves and stick-pins . He bobbled silently in their midst . He was a reporter , albeit not the most dedicated . He made phone calls , he knocked on doors , he injected himself into other people 's lives , into situations , at times unpleasant or terrifically dull situations that most people would take pains to avoid . Then he wrote about them for the Waterloo Weekly , an alternative newspaper specializing in music listings and futon advertisements . As Nick himself was an avoider by instinct , the going was n't always smooth . Or even ambulatory . In work as in life , he delayed , he argued with himself . He waited for some kind of a sign . Once , he 'd heard his name announced over an airport public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had instructed him to proceed immediately to gate number seventeen-this had excited him . He covered news and politics . He 'd never been a bona fide politics junkie ( since the type of gossip that gave the junkies their fix , such as who might be angling to enter the next race for state comptroller , numbed his very organs ) , but chronicling the follies of those in power had for a time imbued him with a sense of purpose-however limited , however faltering . That sense of purpose had faded , though . The disappointments of politics were like the weather : unpredictable as the daily fluctuations were , the same seasonal patterns repeated themselves year after year , so that the only real change lay in the fact that things were slowly getting worse . Global warming , productivity slowdown , a sluggishness spreading among the citizenry , right-wingers in the ascendant . Nick schlepped around to press conferences and wrote about them in a weekly column . He tried to avoid longer assignments . At thirty-two , he had almost relinquished the idea of conducting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of conducting himself at all , rather than forever feeling as if he were being dragged along behind his own life by means of a rope attached to his pants . " Can you hear me ? Is this okay ? " On the dais , a lone gangly figure bent over the microphone , his cheeks pink , his long tie a pendulum , his hands in his pants pockets . He looked out at the row of cameras across the room , and a couple of cameramen raised their thumbs in reply . Oh , to be a cameraman . The cameramen , really more like camera guys , like guys you 'd invite over to watch a ball game or help build a carport , were endowed with a kind of silent geekish authority because of their equipment . Big black video cameras on six-foot tripods anchored the camera guys to a particular spot , where they belonged , where they stood with feet planted wide . Everyone else was in motion . Everyone else squeezed and nudged and if necessary resorted to outright pushing , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they craned their necks and bounced up on their toes . They clapped , at intervals , for no reason at all . The worst were the campaign staffers : sleep-deprived , half-deranged people with stickers on their lapels and cell phones clamped to their ears , ducking this way and that , colliding and then parting again . But even the reporters in the press area were-with the exception of the inertial Sonny Muniz , political columnist for the **26;1234;TOOLONG their territory like big dogs in a very small park . Nick himself avoided designated press areas , media sign-in tables , question-and-answer periods . He 'd never been keen on joining that particular club , and as a writer for a barely respectable publication , he was n't quite the club 's cup of tea either . He kept his notebook in his back pocket and removed it only when necessary : He did n't dress like a reporter , not like the middle-aged newspaperman in his baggy flak vest full of pens , or the television correspondent in her stiff suit . Nick wore glasses with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dark items to offset his lack of bulk . Over a loudspeaker music started to play : Electronic horns , electronic drumming : the theme from Rocky . Not a tune that lent itself to clapping , but people were clapping anyway , searching for the beat , eager for the show to start . There it was : a bubble in the collective chest . Nick could feel it . The staffers , the lobbyists , the old-timers , even a few onlookers from hotel management had all gathered , not unwillingly , here in the Lamar Room with its stain-resistant wallpaper and obese chandelier . They seemed happy to be here , on tiptoes although there was nothing to see yet . No one was safe from it , even Nick , hard as he tried to keep his pulse from elevating in situations involving politicians and the Rocky theme . And what was it ? Difficult to say . Something mysterious conjured like life in a test tube by this roomful of human chemicals all sweating and waiting and clapping , excited because the television cameras were here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ candidate for statewide office , yes , but jazzed anyway ! Never mind that the evening news and elected officials were normally subjects of ridicule . It was a bad movie that made you cry in spite of yourself . Nick was a sucker for those sentimental movie moments , and his heart was thumping now . To the theme from Rocky . Nuh-nuh nuhhhh , nuh-nuh nukhhh . The candidate was making his way toward the podium , accompanied by a man Nick recognized as a state senator and a woman he thought he recognized but could n't identify . He 'd seen her picture somewhere . In a cranberry-colored suit and shimmery blouse , her plucked eyebrows arching high over her eyes , her teeth flashing , she looked like an official photograph . Nick scanned the crowd again and accidentally made eye contact with Hardaway 's press secretary-a short , stolid woman who spoke in short , stern sentences , a former daily reporter and a fixture of the political scene . Looking at Nick , she pointed to the designated press area : Go . People associated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orders . He peeped over at the reporters ' area , a disagreeably small , thronged corral , and stayed where he was , pretending not to have noticed the instruction . Out of the corner of his eye he could tell the press secretary was still signaling him to move . All right . Fine . But blocking his path was a broad woman in a wrinkled jacket . " Excuse me , " he said . The woman did n't react . He touched her jacket and tried again : " Excuse me ? " The woman turned and looked at Nick as if he were slathered in shit , then stepped several millimeters to the left . He wormed his way past her and through the audience and into the reporters ' area . For the sake of something to do he took his phone from his pocket and checked its digital window for the time . On it was a picture of a question mark doing some sort of end-zone dance : missed call . Maybe from Liza . Earlier that morning , Liza had phoned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in his work area , in his socks , staring at his screen saver of busy fish , and had arrived at a decision to stretch . Lifting his arms overhead , he 'd caught sight of Trixie Moss marching grimly in his direction , inclined forward and frowning , which could only mean that his last ( admittedly quite lame ) column had incurred her copy editor 's displeasure , or that there had been some new development in her divorce proceedings . Swiftly he brought his arms down and snatched up the phone to pretend he was on a call , but instead of a dial tone he heard Liza 's " Hello ? " " Liza ? " " I did n't hear the phone ring . " " It did n't . " " But you answered it ? " " It was an accident . " " An accident . " " A good accident , " he added in vain . Her voice sounded flat , and he wondered whether something had happened , and then whether somebody close to her had fallen ill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought of Miles , a friend of hers from childhood ( though very much full-grown now , brawny and carnivorous ) whom she 'd started dating after she and Nick had split up . He thought of Miles keeling over , of Miles giving the bucket a good manly kick . He was still working through this idea when Liza asked whether he could meet her for a drink that evening . He 'd said yes : seeing her was something he wanted to do just about every evening , and he 'd allowed himself , if only fleetingly , to hope that something might come of it . Yet he guessed by her tone of voice that she had n't asked him for a drink so that they could make out afterward in front of her parked car the way he was imagining , nor was she going to disclose that Miles had unexpectedly perished , and so although he wanted to see her in general , the prospect of this particular rendervous , its purpose unclear but serious , made him queasy . Now he flipped open his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his uncle . He snapped the phone shut . The tubby ; perspiring Senator Comal , who because of his untelegenic appearance and two divorces would never be tapped to run for statewide office , began his introduction . I want to tell y'all about a great man and a great leader , Comal began . Raised in a small town . Has small-town values . Educated at our state university . Enlisted in the United States Navy . Farmland Insurance . City Council . State Assembly . A wife and two children . Parents still living in the same small town . At last Comal yelled out Hardaway 's name and the candidate stepped forward to the microphone , squinting a little and mugging at the row of cameras with their gaping black eyes . The clapping quickened ; girlish " whoo ! " noises floated up from the crowd ; flashes whined and strobed . As Nick understood it , Mark ( Shares Your Values ! ) Hardaway had been plucked from the obscurity of a City Council in the western part of the state-having impressed the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mention a congenial malleability when it came to his positions-and thrust into one race for State Assembly , and five years later into another for his current position , commissioner of the Department of Human Needs . Now he was running for governor . Everyone knew this already , but he had n't yet officially announced his candidacy . To announce you had to have cameras and bunting and a speech .
