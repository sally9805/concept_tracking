To find the unspoiled gems , follow the Europeans . By Linda Burbank // Summer travel in Europe too often means waiting in lines , jockeying for position at Buckingham Palace 's Changing of the Guard , or jostling in the queue at the Eiffel Tower . The trouble with the top spots is that they become-especially in high season a monoculture of tourists . It 's hard to fully appreciate a British pub when surrounded by fellow North American tourists . Worse , hospitality standards can decline in crowded conditions . Still , many Americans continue down the same well-worn paths to the same tourist sites . According to a report by the European Travel Commission and the World Tourism Organization , the greater distance people travel , the more likely they 'll cover only the " must-see " sights at their destination ; they 're often unwilling to venture farther afield . Perennial favorites such as Italy , England , and France are anticipating a flood of American tourists this summer , especially with the U.S. dollar buying more than it did last year .

Buying or possessing imitation goods is punishable by fines of up to $365,000 . The European Union is under pressure to crack down on counterfeiting , and that may include more fines for consumers .

Sidebar Calling Scam Watch out for ads promoting cheap phone rates to the U.S. Robert Cooper of Dallas , Tex. , picked up a brochure from his hotel in Brussels advertising calls to the U.S. for just 45 cents per minute , available by dialing toll-free access numbers throughout Europe . But when he returned home , he was shocked to find his credit-card bill included $348 in charges for just four short telephone calls , including one five-minute call for $185 . The business behind the bill is Italian telecommunications company GSIcom . A GSI representative said that rates for calls through its toll-free numbers vary according to time of day and whether they 're automatic or operator-assisted . The low rate on Cooper 's flyer was a weekend-only promotion-but the flyer did n't note this fine print .

Follow these rules : Do n't use your credit card to place a call with unknown companies . Never dial out straight from the phone in your hotel room . And do n't use the calling card from your long-distance company unless you have an international calling plan back home . It is possible to call home cheaply . Your best bet is to buy prepaid calling cards abroad , widely available at tobacco stores and newsstands . They typically come in denominations of euro5 , and rates can be just pennies a minute , though calls to cell phones can cost more . - L.B. // <p>
