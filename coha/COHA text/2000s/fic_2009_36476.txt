I could not see the street or much of the estate . We were enclosed by dirt-coloured blocks , from windows out of which leaned vested men and women with morning hair and mugs of drink , eating breakfast and watching us . This open ground between the buildings had once been sculpted . It pitched like a golf course  --  a child 's mimicking of geography . Maybe they had been going to wood it and put in a pond . There was a copse but the saplings were dead . <br> The grass was weedy , threaded with paths footwalked between rubbish , rutted by wheel tracks . There were police at various tasks . I was n't the first detective there  --  I saw Bardo Naustin and a couple of others  --  but I was the most senior . I followed the sergeant to where most of my colleagues clustered , between a low derelict tower and a skateboard park ringed by big drum-shaped trash bins . Just beyond it we could hear the docks . A bunch of kids sat on a wall before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " Inspector . " I nodded at whomever that was . Someone offered a coffee but I shook my head and looked at the woman I had come to see . <br> She lay near the skate ramps . Nothing is still like the dead are still . The wind moves their hair , as it moved hers , and they do n't respond at all . She was in an ugly pose , with legs crooked as if about to get up , her arms in a strange bend . Her face was to the ground . <br> A young woman , brown hair pulled into pigtails poking up like plants . She was almost naked , and it was sad to see her skin smooth that cold morning , unbroken by gooseflesh . She wore only laddered stockings , one high heel on . Seeing me look for it , a sergeant waved at me from a way off , from where she guarded the dropped shoe . <br> It was a couple of hours since the body had been discovered . I looked her over . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look at her face , but I could only see one open eye . <br> " Where 's Shukman ? " <br> " Not here yet , Inspector " <br> " Someone call him , tell him to get a move on . " I smacked my watch . I was in charge of what we called the mise-en-crime . No one would move her until Shukman the patho had come , but there were other things to do . I checked sightlines . We were out of the way and the garbage containers obscured us , but I could feel attention on us like insects , from all over the estate . We milled . <br> There was a wet mattress on its edge between two of the bins , by a spread of rusting iron pieces interwoven with discarded chains . " That was on her . " The constable who spoke was Lizbyet Corwi , a smart young woman I 'd worked with a couple of times . " Could n't exactly say she was well hidden , but it sort of made her look like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a rough rectangle of darker earth surrounding the dead woman  --  the remains of the ? mattress- ? sheltered dew . Naustin was squatting by it , staring at the earth . <br> " The kids who found her tipped it half off , " Corwi said . <br> " How did they find her ? " <br> Corwi pointed at the earth , at little scuffs of animal paws . <br> " Stopped her getting mauled . Ran like hell when they saw what it was , made the call . Our lot , when they arrived ? . ? . ? . ? " She glanced at two patrolmen I ? did n't know . <br> " They moved it ? " <br> She nodded . " See if she was still alive , they said . " <br> " What are their names ? " <br> " Shushkil and Briamiv . " <br> " And these are the finders ? " I nodded at the guarded kids . There were two girls , two guys . Midteens , cold , looking down . <br> " Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> " That 's dedication , hm ? " she said . " Maybe they 're up for junkies of the month or some shit . They got here a bit before seven . The skate pit 's organised that way , apparently . It 's only been built a couple of years , used to be nothing , but the locals 've got their shift patterns down . Midnight to nine a.m. , chewers only ; nine to eleven , local gang plans the day ; eleven to midnight , skateboards and rollerblades . " <br> " They carrying ? " <br> " One of the boys has a little shiv , but really little . Could n't mug a milkrat with it  --  it 's a toy . And a chew each . That 's it . " She shrugged . " The dope was n't on them ; we found it by the wall , but "  --  shrug  --  " they were the only ones around . " <br> She motioned over one of our colleagues and opened the bag he carried . Little bundles of resin-slathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crossbreed of Catha edulis spiked with tobacco and caffeine and stronger stuff , and fibreglass threads or similar to abrade the gums and get it into the blood . Its name is a trilingual pun : it 's khat where it 's grown , and the animal called " cat " in En- glish is feld in our own language . I sniffed it and it was pretty low-grade stuff . I walked over to where the four teenagers shivered in their puffy jackets . <br> " ' Sup , policeman ? " said one boy in a Bes-accented approximation of hip-hop English . He looked up and met my eye , but he was pale . Neither he nor any of his companions looked well . From where they sat they could not have seen the dead woman , but they did not even look in her direction . <br> They must have known we 'd find the feld , and that we 'd know it was theirs . They could have said nothing , just run . <br> " I 'm Inspector Borl , " I said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm Tyador . A difficult age to question , this  --  too old for first names , euphemisms and toys , not yet old enough to be straightforward opponents in interviews , when at least the rules were clear . " What 's your name ? " The boy hesitated , considered using whatever slang handle he 'd granted himself , did not . <br> " Vilyem Barichi . " <br> " You found her ? " He nodded , and his friends nodded after him . " Tell me . " <br> " We come here because , ' cause , and " Vilyem waited , but I said nothing about his drugs . He looked down . " And we seen something under that mattress and we pulled it off . " <br> " There was some " His friends looked up as Vilyem hesitated , obviously superstitious . <br> " Wolves ? " I said . They glanced at each other . <br> " Yeah man , some scabby little pack was nosing around there and " <br> " So we thought it " <br> " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Vilyem shrugged . " Do n't know . Couple hours ? " <br> " Anyone else around ? " <br> " Saw some guys over there a while back . " <br> " Dealers ? " A shrug . <br> " And there was a van came up on the grass and come over here and went off again after a bit . We ? did n't speak to no one . " <br> " When was the van ? " <br> " Do n't know . " <br> " It was still dark . " That was one of the girls . <br> " Okay . Vilyem , you guys , we 're going to get you some breakfast , something to drink , if you want . " I motioned to their guards . " Have we spoken to the parents ? " I asked . <br> " On their way , boss ; except hers "  --  pointing to one of the girls  --  " we ca n't reach . " <br> " So keep trying . Get them to the centre now . " <br> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bullshit , man , " the boy who was not Vilyem said , uncertainly . He knew that according to some politics he should oppose my instruction , but he wanted to go with my subordinate . Black tea and bread and paperwork , the boredom and striplights , all so much not like the peeling back of that wet heavy , cumbersome mattress , in the yard , in the dark . <br> Stepen Shukman and his assistant Hamd Hamzinic had arrived . I looked at my watch . Shukman ignored me . When he bent to the body he wheezed . He certified death . He made observations that Hamzinic wrote down . <br> " Time ? " I said . <br> " Twelve hours-ish , " Shukman said . He pressed down on one of the woman 's limbs . She rocked . In rigor , and unstable on the ground as she was , she probably assumed the position of her death lying on other contours . " She ? was n't killed here . " I had heard it said many times he was good at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but competent . <br> " Done ? " he said to one of the scene techs . She took two more shots from different angles and nodded . Shukman rolled the woman over with Hamzinic 's help . She seemed to fight him with her cramped motionlessness . Turned , she was absurd , like someone playing at dead insect , her limbs crooked , rocking on her spine . <br> She looked up at us from below a fluttering fringe . Her face was set in a startled strain : she was endlessly surprised by herself . She was young . She was heavily made up , and it was smeared across a badly battered face . It was impossible to say what she looked like , what face those who knew her would see if they heard her name . We might know better later , when she relaxed into her death . Blood marked her front , dark as dirt . Flash flash of cameras . <br> " Well , hello cause of death , " Shukman said to the wounds in her chest . <br> On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long red split . She had been cut half the length of her face . <br> The wound was smooth for several centimetres , tracking precisely along her flesh like the sweep of a paintbrush . Where it went below her jaw , under the overhang of her mouth , it jagged ugly and ended or began with a deep torn hole in the soft tissue behind her bone . She looked unseeingly at me . <br> " Take some without the flash , too , " I said . <br> Like several others I looked away while Shukman murmured  --  it felt prurient to watch . Uniformed mise-en-crime technical investigators , mectecs in our slang , searched in an expanding circle . They overturned rubbish and foraged among the grooves where vehicles had driven . They lay down reference marks , and photographed . <br> " Alright then . " Shukman rose . " Let 's get her out of here . " A couple of the men hauled her onto a stretcher . <br> " Jesus Christ , " I said , " cover her . " Someone found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they started again towards Shukman 's vehicle . <br> " I 'll get going this afternoon , " he said . " Will I see you ? " I wagged my head noncommittally . I walked towards Corwi . <br> " Naustin , " I called , when I was positioned so that Corwi would be at the edge of our conversation . She glanced up and came slightly closer . <br> " Inspector , " said Naustin . <br> " Go through it . " <br> He sipped his coffee and looked at me nervously . <br> " Hooker ? " he said . " First impressions , Inspector . This area , <br> beat- ? up , naked ? And " He pointed at his face , her exaggerated makeup . " Hooker . " <br> " Fight with a client ? " <br> " Yeah butIf it was just the body wounds , you know , you 'd , then you 're looking at , maybe she wo n't do what he wants , whatever . He lashes out . But this . " He touched his cheek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " A sicko ? " <br> He shrugged . " Maybe . He cuts her , kills her , dumps her . Cocky bastard too , does n't give a shit that we 're going to find her . " <br> " Cocky or stupid . " <br> " Or cocky and stupid . " <br> " So a cocky , stupid sadist , " I said . He raised his eyes , Maybe . <br> " Alright , " I said . " Could be . Do the rounds of the local girls . Ask a uniform who knows the area . Ask if they 've had trouble with anyone recently . Let 's get a photo circulated , put a name to Fulana Detail . " I used the generic name for woman-unknown . " First off I want you to question Barichi and his mates , there . Be nice , Bardo , they ? did n't have to call this in . I mean that . And get Yaszek in with you . " Ramira Yaszek was an excellent questioner . " Call me this afternoon ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corwi , " A few years ago we 'd not have had half as many guys on the murder of a working girl . " <br> " We 've come a long way , " she said . She was n't much older than the dead woman . <br> " I doubt Naustin 's delighted to be on streetwalker duty , but you 'll notice he 's not complaining , " I said . <br> " We 've come a long way , " she said . <br> " So ? " I raised an eyebrow . Glanced in Naustin 's direction . I waited . I remembered Corwi 's work on the Shulban disappearance , a case considerably more Byzantine than it had initially appeared . <br> " It 's just , I guess , you know , we should keep in mind other possibilities , " she said . <br> " Tell me . " <br> " Her makeup , " she said . " It 's all , you know , earths and browns . It 's been put on thick , but it 's not  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " I had . " Not dyed . Take a drive with me up GunterStrsz , around by the arena , any of the girls ' hangouts . Two-thirds blonde , I reckon . And the rest are black or bloodred or some shit . And " She fingered the air as if it were hair . " It 's dirty , but it 's a lot better than mine . " She ran her hand through her own split ends . <br> For many of the streetwalkers in Beszel , especially in areas like this , food and clothes for their kids came first ; feld or crack for themselves ; food for themselves ; then sundries , in which list conditioner would come low . I glanced at the rest of the officers , at Naustin gathering himself to go . <br> " Okay , " I said . " Do you know this area ? " <br> " Well , " she said , " it 's a bit off the track , you know ? This is hardly even Beszel , really . My beat 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got the bell . But I did a tour here a couple years ago  --  I know it a bit . " <br> Lestov itself was already almost a suburb , six or so k out of the city centre , and we were south of that , over the Yovic Bridge on a bit of land between Bulkya Sound and , nearly , the mouth where the river joined the sea . Technically an island , though so close and conjoined to the mainland by ruins of industry you would never think of it as such , Kordvenna was estates , warehouses , low-rent bodegas scribble-linked by endless graffiti . It was far enough from Bes zel 's heart that it was easy to forget , unlike more inner-city slums . <br> " How long were you here ? " I said . <br> " Six months , standard . What you 'd expect : street theft , high kids smacking shit out of each other , drugs , hooking . " <br> " Murder ? " <br> " Two or three in my time . Drugs stuff . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are pretty smart at punishing each other without bringing in ECS . " <br> " Someone 's fucked up then . " <br> " Yeah . Or does n't care . " <br> " Okay , " I said . " I want you on this . What are you doing at the moment ? " <br> " Nothing that ca n't wait . " <br> " I want you to relocate for a bit . Got any contacts here still ? " She pursed her lips . " Track them down if you can ; if not , have a word with some of the local guys , see who their singers are . I want you on the ground . Listen out , go round the estate  --  what 's this place called again ? " <br> Continues ...
