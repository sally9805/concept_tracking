Official censorship reveals the interpretive will of the state and the moral consensus of those nearest to state power . Recent literature on the history of censorship has moved beyond easy condemnations of the practice to investigate the subject " as a complex configuration of both restrictive and productive textual practices further mediated by dynamics of social and historical context . " 1 This body of research has focused on the censorship of written materials , by its nature a more intellectual vocation than film censorship , the subject of this article . But film censoring also reflects a sort of intellectual engagement that sheds light on the reception of global cinema culture through the moral visions of a changing local censor class The work of these local censors represents political compromises resulting from conflict between the state and commercial cinema , as well as conflict among censors and the communities they claim to represent . <p> This article examines the political processes that emerged with the growth of cinema in colonial and postcolonial Tanzania . Its central focus is on the awkwardly titled cinematograph licensing boards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Recent scholars of cinema in colonial Africa have framed their studies around the topic of anxieties held by European officials and settlers towards the corrupting influence of Western cinema on " impressionable " African filmgoers . Such a corruption , Europeans feared , might undermine the racial boundaries that supported colonial hierarchies . As the institutional manifestation of these anxieties , colonial film censorship occupies a central place in these studies. 2 Yet the analysis offered here also seeks to situate the significance of censorship beyond a chronicle of the condescension and fears of Europeans and into a broader framework of struggle for institutional control over cinema itself in the context of the increasing democratization of local and national politics . In many ways this struggle over democratizing access to cinema and its censorship broadly mirrors the struggle of African nationalists for political independence but also reveals the contradictions of the censoring nationalist elite and significant continuities between colonial and postcolonial statecraft in Africa . Finally , this article offers a preliminary sketch of the social and economic history of urban cinemas and cinema-going in Tanzania , an under-studied subject of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sub-Saharan Africa. 3 Imperial Origins of Film Censorship <p> Film censorship in Tanganyika and Zanzibar grew from precedents established in Britain and British India . Calls for censorship followed just two years after Britain 's first film showing in 1896 , but only in 1909 was legislation passed to regulate public film screenings , concerned mainly with fire hazards . Local councils in Britain understood this legislation broadly to censor film content , and by 1912 pressured the film industry to form a trade-sponsored British Board of Film Censors . Local councils tied public licensing to the Board 's approval of films , creating the British film censorship system . The Board was mainly concerned with ensuring public morality , enforcing two cardinal rules imposed by the Home Office - no nudity and no portrayal of Christ - as well as discouraging displays of sympathetic criminals , lustful or drunken women , inter-racial sex , and the ridiculing of British social life. 4 In British India , the Indian Cinematograph Act of 1918 put film licensing in the hands of the district magistrates or commissioners of police , and films first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ major community was guaranteed representation , though executive power lay with official members , especially the police . Non-official members , mostly Indian , were restricted to passing moral and religious judgment on each film 's suitability , while mostly British colonial officials retained control over political content. 5 Public morality concerns dominated film censorship to a greater degree than in Britain . Depictions of rape , leading young girls astray , prostitution , feminine nudity , female intoxication , debauchery , religious desecration , and " torture of cruelty scenes by whites versus blacks or vice versa " would render a film " undesirable for exhibition in British India , " 6 Heightened religious and racial sensitivity became the hallmark of Indian film censorship , setting parameters for East Africa 's experience . <p> Britain made a single attempt to set a film censorship policy for its African colonies in 1929 , when the Colonial Office convened a Colonial Films Committee . The committee ' report addressed the question of imperial censorship control through a central body in London. 7 The colonial secretary himself rejected centralized film censorship for Africa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be effective in preventing the exhibition of undesirable films , for " what is harmless in London may well be , and often is , open to grave objection in a Colony . " 8 The committee 's report did , however , set out censorship criteria that became the standard for Britain 's African territories . Its most important conclusion was that " There should be no discrimination between European and non-European audiences in licensing films for public exhibition . " 9 In a revealing minority report , Hesketh Bell attacked the majority 's recommendations for not going far enough to guard the moral development of " the primitive peoples in our vast territories in tropic Africa " ; PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Bell did agree , however , with the Report 's conclusion that discriminating between European and non-European audiences in licensing films for public exhibition was fundamentally unsound. 11 This question of differing standards for " educated sections " - particularly in a multiracial community like Tanganyika , where Europeans and Indians presented themselves as " trustees " of allegedly vulnerable " native " Africans - remained a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 1930s and 1940s . <p> Three poles of influence shaped the development of cinema censorship in colonial Tanganyika and Zanzibar . The first pole came from Colonial Office directives based in London embodied in the Colonial Films Committee report , which suggested a color-blind , single system of censorship that stressed caution in exposing " native " Africans to the images and lessons of world cinema . The second pole came from South Africa , which quickly instituted a graded system of censorship that distinguished among Europeans , " non-Europeans , " and for all except " natives . " Initiated by councils of European " social reformers " horrified at the corrupting influence of cinema and its potential dangers to race relations , South Africa 's film censorship boards starkly reflected white anxieties and readily restricted any and all cinematic images from Africans. 12 The third pole of influence came from British India , which had developed a cinema censorship tradition that made little use of native/non-native distinctions but was sharply sensitive to issues of religious representation and keen to prohibit messages of Indian nationalism . British India had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of regulatory questions and demands . Each of these three poles were at work in Tanganyika , and were drawn upon by urban censors who reformulated external approaches to film censorship to meet local demands for the inclusion and exclusion of urban citizenship and " civilization . " The victory of African nationalists and their subsequent film censorship policies in postcolonial Tanzania repudiated the censorship traditions of British India and South Africa , but ensconced many of the original paternalistic dictates of the Colonial Office . The Struggle for Local Control over Cinema , 1920-1940 <p> Motion pictures arrived in East Africa shortly before the First World War . In Tanzania , films were initially displayed in makeshift cinemas housed in tents in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar Town. 13 The first two permanent theaters in Dar es Salaam , the Bharat and Krishna Cinemas , were opened in small godowns in the town 's Indian quarter . Tanganyika 's first major theater was the Empire Cinema , opened in late 1929 by Hassanali Adamali Jariwalla , an Indian theater entrepreneur who pioneered the first cinemas in Zanzibar. 14 The Empire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American films on Wednesdays , Thursdays , and Fridays , while showing Indian films on Saturdays , Sundays , and Mondays. 15 The Empire Cinema was later joined by other movie houses such as the Chox , Avalon , Empress , Cameo , and Odeon Cinemas. 16 By the early 1930s , cinema houses had been established throughout the provincial towns of Tanganyika . Areas too small to support a permanent theater would be visited periodically by mobile cinema vans that exhibited films in a tent holding up to a hundred people. 17 Both permanent and mobile cinemas were owned almost entirely by Indians . <p> Cinema offered a steady stream of visual and visceral connection between the urban centers of East Africa and Europe , America , and India . For Europeans and Indians , films provided the best relief from the tedium of daily life . The Tanganyika Opinion , an Indian-owned newspaper in Dar es Salaam , commented that : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Films arrived in East Africa through commercial networks linking the region to South Africa , India , and Europe . During the interwar period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East Africa was African Films , Ltd. , a South African company that would send films first to Nairobi , then elsewhere in Kenya , Uganda , and northern Tanganyika before finally being exhibited in Dar es Salaam and Zanzibar. 19 The theater entrepreneur H. A. Jariwalla also pioneered an Indian film distribution network for East Africa after the First World War. 20 Most films screened in Tanganyika were produced in India , the United States , or Europe , supplemented by government films from Tanganyika 's Information Department and various government-produced " Bantu " films . The Bantu Educational Kinema Experiment ( BEKE ) was initially conceived by the International Missionary Council as a chain of Bantu cinemas , separate from and protected from commercial entertainment theaters , to run through East Africa and Northern Rhodesia . The mooted theater chain never materialized , and the 35 educational films produced by BEKE between 1935 and 1937 proved rather unpopular with both African audiences and colonial officials - seasoned African filmgoers in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam found BEKE films " too educational . " 21 <p> Throughout East Africa , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first came under formal control for reasons of physical safety. 22 Soon after , police were asked to control aspects of film that threatened public morality . A Secretariat official raised this issue after seeing " a poster shewing a white woman , somewhat lightly clad , clinging to the ankles of a native warrior who was surrounded by a number of similar braves . This sort of thing ought not to be permitted . " 23 Granted authority in 1921 to censor films under a loosely defined Township Ordinance , Dar es Salaam police understood censoring to be first the removal of any violent interaction between Africans and Europeans . The following year a Cinematograph Regulation Ordinance empowered district officers to ensure the physical safety of cinema shows , and police commissioners to censor films for exhibition , but did not lay out criteria for censoring film content. 24 A similarly haphazard pattern characterized Zanzibar 's early attempts at censorship . Zanzibar Town 's commissioner of police found it ridiculous that he would " have to sit in a dark hall alone on two afternoons each week watching these extremely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He instead entrusted Jariwalla to censor the films he exhibited. 25 By 1923 , however , the Zanzibar British Resident claimed that films depicting crimes had a powerful influence " on the minds of young Arabs and Swahilis , " which had led them to commit crimes , including " holding up motor cars containing Arabs or Indians or Goans and even beating and robbing the occupants . " The entente between officials and cinema proprietors broke down and the former established the Zanzibar Town Stage Plays and Cinematograph Exhibition Board in 1924 ; a board for Pemba two years later. 26 <p> By the late 1920s film censorship came to be viewed as a public concern requiring greater public representation , driven above all the desire to segregate exhibitions between native ( i.e. , African ) and non-native audiences . The Tanganyika Standard , representative of European opinion , argued for a system of effective control " over the exhibition of films which , while suitable to European entertainment , may not be desirable for native entertainment . " 27 Differences in cinema literacy were too profound , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A three-tiered system emerged , where the censorship board deemed films suitable for audiences of all races , for " non-native " audiences only , or banned entirely . A small censorship advisory board was constituted in 1927 to assist police in Dares Salaam . By 1930 , the burden of weekly film censoring had rendered this improvised system impractical . Following Zanzibar 's lead , Tanganyika passed the Cinematograph Ordinance in 1930 to establish a Film Licensing Board . The main board in Dar es Salaam consisted initially of 12 members , all European , who worked in a voluntary capacity. 28 This board quickly doubled in size , which meant in practice that smaller groups of five or six did the censoring , resulting in tremendous inconsistencies in standards and , occasionally , incomprehensible editing. 29 The Ordinance also empowered other townships in Tanganyika to convene censorship boards for purposes of exhibition , effectively nullifying the Dar es Salaam board 's central authority over exhibitions , as towns such as Mwanza and Moshi received films ahead of the capital. 30 <p> The reigning criteria of film censorship reveal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in East Africa towards the dangers of film for the territory 's African population . In the interwar years , censors were most careful to cut film scenes showing interracial violence or crime . In 1929 , the police and censorship advisory board collectively considered the movie Do or Die unfit for exhibition to Africans because " certain episodes presented a castle scene which might well have been taken for the Boma of Tanga , Kilwa , Mikindant sic or Newala .. The plot was one of pitched battles and skirmishes between gangs of white and black mixed , of stabbing , trussing-up and imprisoning antagonists - including women . " 31 The film was released for " exhibition to Europeans and Asiatics only . " Censors feared that cinema might teach Africans crime - the superintendent of education warned the police that " The fighting in the film Deeds of Daring might be taken as sheer buffoonery , but the cat-burglar act and attempted abduction of a person from a balcony by hurling him down to a waiting motor-car would not do . " 32 A European newspaper editorial ruminated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TABLE <p> Tanganyika 's colonial government also sought to control African interpretations of film through its didactic Swahili-language press . An editorial in Mambo Leo instructed African viewers that films , like traditional Swahili hadithi ( stories ) of 1001 Nights or Abunuwas , were fictional , and film violence was neither to be taken literally nor to be imitated. 34 <p> Local censors sought to control the export as well as import of cinematic images in East Africa . Following outcries in the British press against a scene of animal cruelty in Paul Hoefler 's 1930 film Africa Speaks , the Tanganyikan government added provisions to the Cinematograph Ordinance to regulate all cinema production . Although the controversial scene was shot in Hollywood , not Tanganyika , officials felt that they " should have some say in the matter when there was a danger of films going out of the country and depicting to audiences overseas scenes and incidents which may give distorted impressions . " 35 The Ordinance invested the Dar es Salaam board with territorial powers to control any films produced in Tanganyika , allowing government assistance for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Europeans and Africans as well as undesirable interaction between European ladies and Africans. 36 Local newspapers had earlier blasted the MGM film West of Zanzibar for misrepresenting Africa to audiences in Britain . West of Zanzibar offended whites across East Africa for its depiction of Africa as a " Heart of Darkness , " replete with African cannibals and fetish-worshippers , as well as European drunks , con artists , and thieves . Such images reflected poorly on British colonial rule and the progress of civilization , particularly in the film 's climatic scene where whites prove unable to overcome the savage " native " custom of human sacrifice . Just as British or American films require control before exhibition in front of Africans , the editor reasoned , " so is it just as necessary to have a proper censorship of films from Africa intended for exhibition in those civilized countries . " 37 The board was not afraid to overrule the Colonial Office 's authorization to shoot the German film Knights of East Africa in Tanganyika , a film celebrating the valor of German civilians and officials in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give a permit for its production in the territory. 38 <p> Tanganyika 's film censorship board institutionalized the distinction between " native " and " non-native " in their rating system , following the lead of British Southern Africa , 39 despite being in violation of the 1929 Colonial Films Committee recommendations and League of Nations mandate against racial discrimination . This action was officially sanctioned at the highest levels - the chief secretary held that because Africans " are not in the habit of attending the local cinema , " then " no evil results arise " from passing films for exhibition to " non-natives only . " Another official opined that " in a country like Tanganyika it was impossible to prevent Europeans , or Indians , seeing the pictures that were entitled to see . " 40 The director of medical services complained that , while medical educational films from America were instructionally excellent , they were ultimately of " doubtful educational value " because they " show ' poor whites ' " living in the southern United States " under conditions far worse than almost anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Africa . " 41 By 1933 , a clear set of censorship principles had emerged . The Board 's goal , an official memorandum stated , was " to mitigate any evil influences of the cinema whilst providing that the access of Africans to it shall be made progressively more easy over a period of years . " 42 <p> By democratizing censorship , even in this limited way , to include non-official members , the colonial government unwittingly broached a debate about cultural and religious representation . The dynamics of colonial film censorship were not limited to European control over the image diet of Africans . Dar es Salaam had always had a considerable Indian population actively involved in the city 's economy , politics , and cultural life. 43 Zanzibar too had a significant Indian population , but a greater proportion of its filmgoers were African or Shirazi , whereas Indian filmgoers predominated in Dar es Salaam. 44 Yet Indians were sharply divided by religion and caste , and particularly defensive about how Indian society should be represented in front of East African audiences . In 1928 , The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its critical portrayal of India 's caste system. 45 Two years later , the town 's small Sinhalese Buddhist community protested the exhibition of The Light of Asia , a film about the life of the Buddha , demanding that scenes depicting the birth of Buddha and his courtship with Princess Gopa be removed . Such was the community 's anger after their requests were ignored that scores of police had to be deployed in front of the town 's Empire Cinema , together with airplane reconnaissance , as prevention against feared disturbances. 46 The Anjuman Islamia , a Punjabi-led , pan-Islamic organization in Dar es Salaam , preemptively protested against the showing of the film Yusuf Zulikha on grounds that " Islam do sic not allow any sort of photography or mutation of its Prophets whatsoever , " 47 although no theater had asked permission to exhibit the film . <p> Indian political leaders responded to these events by demanding representation on censorship boards .

" 49 In this cause as in others , Tanganyika 's vibrant Indian press happily posited universal arguments of political equality alongside communal arguments of cultural difference. 50 After two years of lobbying , the government finally relented and appointed Indian members to the Dar es Salaam board and other regional ones in late 1930 and 1931 , but solely for the purpose of censoring Indian films. 51 Zanzibar 's censorship board had Arab and Indian representation from its inception , and by the 1940s all films were censored entirely by race - " all European films being censored by Europeans , Indian films by the Indian Members of the Board and Arab films by the Arab Members of the Board . " 52 <p> Despite winning seats , Indians chafed under their exclusion from control over English-language films .

" 53 Although final film ratings did not categorize between European and Indian audiences , the scene-by-scene process of censorship by board members did . The chairman of Tanganyika 's film censorship board observed that " the most usual ground of complaint against the Censors " was their identification of a film scene as unsuitable for " exhibition to Asiatics. " 54 Assumed cultural difference again provided the rationale for censorship . The difference between " the ideas of Hindu and Mohammedan races " on the one hand and those of Europeans on the other were so great that " almost every film contains some incident which is liable to be misunderstood and misrepresented by the great majority of the Asiatic population of the Territory . " 55 When the Dar es Salaam censorship board took the rare step of restricting the Nazi propaganda film Triumph of the Will to Europeans only , the decision was met with outrage by Indians. 56 Yet grounds for a broad consensus between Europeans and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before exhibition to " native " Africans . The Indian community was no less anxious about the corrupting dangers this cinema might bring than were Europeans . An Indian newspaper warned : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Indian " non-natives " of Tanganyika , an earlier editorial explained , were mature enough for exposure to the " society scandals " of Europeans , just as " non-natives " elsewhere in East Africa and India were. 58 <p> The racial distinctions of censorship ratings mirrored the racial-cum-class patterns of theater attendance among Tanganyika 's urban film-going audiences . At Dar es Salaam 's premier theater , the Empire , audiences were European and Indian , with few Africans attending. 59 In the early 1930s , Africans were simply denied access to cinemas except for those films specially designated for " general exhibition . " Not knowing in advance which films they might be permitted to see , few took the trouble of making the long walk across town to Dar es Salaam 's Indian neighborhood , where most of the cinemas were located. 60 Seeking the respectability and recognition felt their due , educated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level of education instead of race - the African Association requested that " educated natives of good character be granted special permits to see films passed for Non-Natives only . " 61 Members were incensed that educated Africans should be denied entry but not uneducated Indians and Arabs , the latter of whom " live with native wives and have native mothers , and their children , so called Arabs , are in actual fact - natives . " 62 The provincial commissioner rejected the argument , explaining that " Arabs and Indians do not demand the exercise of our trusteeship to the same extent as the natives , they have ages of civilization behind them . " 63 He continued : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> His successor , however , was moved by the African Association 's arguments and argued to abolish the " suitable for non-native " rating , as it " gives rise to a feeling of resentment among the educated Africans at a regulation which they consider suggests they are inferior persons in comparison with the others . " 65 Philip Mitchell , Tanganyika 's secretary of native @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any film which is fit for public exhibition may be exhibited to any African , educated or not , but I would not license many films which are now licensed . " 66 Secretariat officials continued to debate whether or not to adopt the policy of neighboring Kenya , which distinguished between " native " and " non-native " for the purpose of approving film exhibitions , or the policy of Zanzibar and Uganda , where no such censorship distinction was made. 67 After another round of pressure from the African Association , the government in 1936 finally decreed that all films be licensed only for universal exhibition , over the misgivings of the Dar es Salaam censorship board. 68 <p> Despite this breakthrough , social and economic pressures worked to segregate urban theater attendance . Theater owners , particularly of Dar es Salaam 's two premier theaters , the Empire and the Globe , frequently banned Africans from attending films - including those approved for all audiences - out of fear of losing European and Indian customers. 69 Africans trying to enter were harassed and often forced to attend poorer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dar es Salaam complained that Indian staff at the Empire and Globe cinemas would ask a series of humiliating questions and , upon certifying that he was not Arab but African , inform him that Africans were not allowed , regardless of censorship approval " for natives . " 70 As early as 1931 , officials considered establishing a theater " solely for the native population " to ensure for African filmgoers a place where they would not be turned away. 71 Economics proved an even greater barrier to African film attendance . The director of education observed that African attendance was " for all practical purposes negligible , " and that " Even if economic conditions returned to normal one can not picture the African native turning , into a ' film fan ' - unless admission was free ! " 72 Years later , larger theaters were practically segregated by confluence of race and class , with Africans taking the cheaper floor seats and Europeans and Indians taking the balcony seats. 73 In 1935 , the government began construction of Alexandra Cinema , the designated " native " theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like its London name . sake , for the purpose of affordable and suitable mass entertainment . Originally the township market and African beer hall , the property was converted into a theater by government , then turned over to the owner of the Empire Theatre. 74 Postwar social welfare officers put more energy into creating mobile film units for rural areas , lest urban cinema shows " should develop into yet one more magnet to attract rural Africans into the towns . " 75 In 1948 , government converted the Alexandra Cinema into an African welfare center , at the same time that the Colonial Film Unit took up the project left idle by BEKE to make morally instructive films for a Tanganyikan African audience. 76 By the 1950s , private investors - invariably Indian - were finally constructing commercial cinemas in urban African neighborhoods , such as the Amana Cinema in Ilala , Dar es Salaam , although their commercial viability appears to have always been tenuous. 77 The dynamic differed in Zanzibar , where Africans rather than Indians formed the bulk of the ticket-buying public , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharply than those on the mainland. 78 War , Commerce , and Subversive Propaganda , 1939-1954 <p> Politically subversive cinema struck at a time when the resources of the British colonial states were stretched thin by wartime demands . British censors in India had tried to maintain a blackout of all references to the Indian National Congress because of its decision to boycott the war . Indian producers nonetheless had cleverly inserted Congress symbols into their films , to the cheers of the audiences. 79 Advertising for The Drum , a film that glorified imperial British victories over Muslim Pathan tribesmen , unleashed a cascade of angry letters from Indians in Dar es Salaam . They considered the film , which had caused a riot in Bombay upon its release in September 1938 , as an insult to Indian national prestige. 80 Indian films produced during the Congress " interregnum " of 1937-1939 enjoyed little censorship of overt Congress propaganda , 81 and such films continued to circulate in East Africa after the outbreak of war . In Brandichi Batli ( Marathi/Hindi , Bottle of Brandy ) , the protagonist is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ project to enact Gandhian morality towards national liberation. 82 An angry European intelligence officer complained that " The picture had its full effect on the public who saw it and many were heard ( in and out of the cinema hall ) praising the Indian National Congress for its activities . " 83 The same officer had also objected to the exhibition of Shama Parwana ( Hindi , Flame of Love ) , which depicted the Indian nation " as poor and oppressed by the Government ; and that with good leadership and great propaganda the nation overthrew the power of the Government and triumphed . " 84 Such films passed Tanganyikan censors in part because Indians had significant control over the censorship of Indian films , in particular a practical monopoly over the Hindi language. 85 Tanganyikan officials feared that the " Quit India " protest of late 1942 would resound among Tanganyika 's small but powerful Indian communities . Tanga 's censorship board moved to ban a slide photograph of Gandhi in a town cinema , " in view of the acclamations with which the slide is greeted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also intervened to ban the Vande Mataram , or Indian national anthem , which had been played before the exhibition of Indian films. 87 But the territory 's censorship boards found themselves overwhelmed and understaffed , and owing to stretched resources and competing priorities , Indians in East Africa enjoyed the opportunity to see Indian films that were simultaneously banned in India. 88 <p> The gradual democratization of film censorship finally touched Dar es Salaam 's African elite by the late 1930s . H. M. T. Kayamba had been the first African seated on the Dar es Salaam censorship board in early 1936 , and was replaced by Kleist Sykes two years later . Foreshadowing later attitudes of Tanganyika 's African elite , Sykes joined the board 's Indian and European censor in rejecting the Indian film Flying Rani for exhibition , citing incidents of murder , robbery , and " a short close up of an actor mauling a female 's leg under a table . " 89 In 1942 , Sykes was replaced by the independent newspaper publisher Erica Fiah , and two other Africans were added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , mainland Tanganyika was far ahead of Zanzibar . As late as 1947 the Zanzibar Town censor board still had no African representation - one official doubted that a mooted African candidate . Sheikh Ameir Tajo , would have sufficient knowledge of English to function on the board. 91 Tajo was eventually appointed in 1948 and remained the only African on the Zanzibar Town censorship board ( there were none on the Pemba board ) until the mid-1950s . Tajo had to fight to make sure he was not passed over by cinema managers , who would often seize upon the excuse of censor unavailability to justify screening films without consulting " certain " censors on duty. 92 <p> The enormous burdens of wartime administration pushed film censorship far down government 's list of priorities , while the quality and numbers of films circulating through East Africa also fell . Subsequently censorship board seats lost some desirability and the censoring became even more amateurish and haphazard . Despite having African members , the Dar es Salaam board voted in December 1940 to reassert the right to restrict the exhibition of pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proliferation of films with " glamour , " " bedroom scenes , " and " gangster violence , " as well as wartime newsreels depicting havoc caused by air raids , was together too harmful to " African development " and therefore required discrimination . The Secretariat denied their request on grounds that it would only revive racial discrimination. 93 So old and poor were the films circulating in Tanganyika during the Second World War that the Dar es Salaam censorship board - always a veritable Who 's Who of the town - groused that smaller towns in other colonies enjoyed better films , and even had difficulty obtaining quorums. 94 Several Indian films were not permitted for public exhibition during the war because the board could not secure two appointed Indian censors to review the films. 95 The Dar es Salaam board responded by opening up its ranks to a large number of female members , many the wives of European colonial officers. 96 The subsequent economics this posed distressed representatives of American film companies : " The Dar es Salaam censor board still consists of over 40 members , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest then demand free entrance to the theater during public performance . Can anything be done to stop this racket ? " 97 Exhibitors had no right to appeal decisions , and members were under no obligation to give reasons for rejecting a film. 98 An experienced film exhibitor in Tanganyika complained that the board had rejected films as unsuitable for Africans for the following reasons : " a film showing a white girl dancing while American negro playing at piano , a British comedy with a ghost story , because that would encourage witchcraft among the African .. A true war spy story , because the informer turns out to be British at the end of the picture . " 99 <p> There had been little debate in Tanganyika or Zanzibar about what moral standards should be used since the inception of cinema censorship . Policies of the 1940s and 1950s reflected the standards set by Tanganyika 's 1935 Cinematographic Rules . After the war , Dar es Salaam 's provincial commissioner and Zanzibar 's municipal officer announced that the 1930s policy of banning films would continue to hold for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order or decency. " 100 Controversies instead focused on the people who did the censoring , how they did it , and at what commercial expense . The Tanganyika Standard was particularly keen to point out the disproportionate role played by women censors in denying Dar es Salaam its cinematic entertainment , and noted the inconsistencies in the female members ' decisions. 101 One official waspishly noted that European membership on the Dar es Salaam board " seems to consist chiefly of ladies who regard it as a fashionable occupation which enables them to see a large number of films for free , even if not at all . " 102 Cries grew for a professional censor to take over the ham-handed and plot-destroying editing of films. 103 To make the censorship project more " scientific , " one inveterate letter-writer suggested that the reactions of a European , an Indian , an Arab , and an African to each be studied to measure acceptability - the middle two representing the " golden mean " and thus avoiding both extremes of permissibility or prohibition. 104 <p> The censors ' desire to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owners . Cinema became big business in East Africa by the early 1930s and grew rapidly again after the Second World War . The desperation with which filmgoers , particularly South Asians , sought tickets was remarkable . Years before the war , a violent incident broke out at the Empire Cinema , where a rush of people to see the film Maya Machindra was so large that " the management had to call for police aid and had to ask their native servants to disperse the crowd by force to save the main gate . " 105 During the 1940s , Africans began to immigrate to cities in large numbers , enough with discretionary income to form a sizable film-going population . A large number of permanent theaters were constructed in the years 1950-1955 , and there was a similar profusion in mobile van shows in the peri-urban areas of Dar es Salaam and other towns. 106 The most poignant manifestation of this growth was the existence of a vigorous black market in film tickets , particularly for Indian films , which enjoyed a bigger audience , were shown less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than English-language films. 107 By 1952 , a good Indian film in Dar es Salaam would sell out in two hours , with most tickets purchased by young , strong Indian men with the spare time and energy to fight their ways through ticket queues - the editor of the Tanganyika Standard stating that they looked " more like wild monkeys than human beings . " 108 Many theaters ' profits were derived from bars attached to the premise. 109 The greatest difficulty was to keep people from slipping in without paying - Dar es Salaam 's police commissioner felt this was a major source of fights that broke out at the cinemas. 110 <p> But imperial rather than commercial pressure finally pushed Tanganyika to professionalize its film censorship system . After the propaganda film Sports Parade in Moscow passed Dar es Salaam 's censors in late 1950 , officials became concerned by the amount of interest it aroused among African and Asian youth , particularly in how it " tended to refute the impression that living conditions in Russia are bad .

Tanganyika 's chief secretary agreed , criticizing the board as a " collection of amateurs " who " concern themselves with things which might be offensive to persons or communities mainly on religious or moral grounds and do not consider the political aspects , " and promising to reform and professionalize territorial film censorship. 112 Colonial officers and private citizens alike increasingly avoided appointment to the work done by the forty-odd , mostly female volunteers of the board , particularly as Hollywood distributors were becoming more aggressive in challenging their decisions to prohibit exhibitions. 113 In 1954 , Tanganyika appointed a professional film censor given centralized powers over film exhibitions for the whole of Tanganyika , although regional censorship boards continued to exist , He was in turn authorized to pay examiners a flat rate per sitting to review films. 114 Competition for appointments to the censorship board was now based on considerations of finance rather than prestige. 115 A new censorship rating system , based on age with no reference to race , was adopted by Tanganyika and Zanzibar. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ predecessors , banning Blackboard Jungle because , the board feared , the crime and violence would have a demoralizing effect " on those sections of the audience not sufficiently educated " to grasp the implications. 117 Multiracial ism , African Nationalism , and Film Censorship , 1954-1967 <p> During the mid- to late 1950s , the engineered democratization of multiracial censorship boards rapidly gave way to an African nationalist film censorship policy . Multiracialism had become the new policy for film censorship boards in 1954 , giving equal representation to Africans , Indians , and Europeans. 118 But African nationalists demanded policy changes in censorship , particularly relating to negative cinematic representations of Africans . At the founding conference of the Tanganyika African Nationalist Union ( TANU ) in July 1954 , the portrayal of Africans as savages in popular films was debated and a campaign proposed to persuade people not to perform dances or allow themselves to be photographed by Europeans. 119 In 1955 , African students in India protested against the exhibition of Colonial Film Unit productions such as Chalo Amerudi and staged a walkout of the American film @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rural - a sympathetic Dar es Salaam correspondent asked " If the films of Africans are interesting or more enjoyable to the world , why not take films of Africans in good suits ? " 120 After winning national elections in 1958-59 , TANU members of the Legislative Council took aim at filmmaking in East Africa . A scene in the film Zanzibuku , Lawi Sijaona complained , showed " an African mother suckling a young lion cub , " while another juxtaposed a monkey playing with a camera and a naked African boy playing with a camera . Indian parliamentarians , no longer paternalist trustees but nationalist enablers , echoed these criticisms. 121 Some Indian theater owners were keen to help TANU ; in Tanga , the local TANU branch was given use of the town 's three cinemas to raise money to send a delegate to the Asian Socialist Conference in Bombay. 122 Other areas were characterized by conflict . In 1958 , the Northern Province branch of TANU spearheaded a successful boycott against an Indian-owned theater to retaliate against Asians who had helped break an African-led strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Salaam . Further boycotts were planned against Indian cinemas as a part of Nyerere 's " positive action " campaign , but did not come to pass. 123 African nationalism was not nearly so straightforward in Zanzibar , where a bitter row broke out over the exhibition of the 1954 British production West of Zanzibar . The film narrated the plight of the fictional East African " Galana " tribe , who were forced by drought and pestilence to move to the coast , only to be corrupted by Arab and Indian ivory smugglers . The Arab newspaper Mwongozi condemned the film as a piece of European libel against Arabs and Indians and feared that such propaganda would only heighten African racial consciousness and hostility towards foreigners. 124 Fearing public unrest , Zanzibar 's chief secretary directed the censorship board to carefully censor West of Zanzibar in June 1954. 125 The African newspaper Afrika Kwetu asked that the film be exhibited , arguing that its exhibition would help Africans to understand their own history . A debate raged throughout July and August between Afrika Kwetu and Mwangaza , a " Shirazi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that West of Zanzibar accurately reflected East African history and condemned the film for fomenting hatred against " our Arab fellowmen . " The film was finally exhibited publicly at Zanzibar 's Sultana Theatre in October , without disturbance and much to the acclaim of Afrika Kwetu. 126 <p> Nationalist film censorship guidelines were enacted soon after Tanganyika gained internal self-government in late 1960 . Rashidi Kawawa , himself a former film actor , was appointed as first chairman of the National Film Censorship Board . He instructed a German film company proposing to shoot the film Unser haus am Kilimanjaro to alter the closing scene of their proposed screenplay , which called for " hundreds of Africans , with torches to arrive dancing and singing to welcome the heroine as the new mistress of Ambrock Farm . " This , in Kawawa 's view , had put Africans " in a position of inferiority in their own country . this was usual in the circumstances of the past but not to-day , " 127 The TANU paper Uhuru announced after independence that foreign cinema destroyed African culture and history by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pioneer an all-African film production system. 128 Kawawa 's successor as chief censor , Yusuf Marsha , spelled out the new censorship policy , joining African nationalism and colonial paternalism : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> Nationalist elites agreed with the earlier views of European and Indian leaders that cinema for Africans should be utilized primarily as a didactic tool for self-improvement rather than for entertainment . Upon independence , Uganda , Kenya , and Tanzania together banned film imports from South Africa - then still the region 's main distribution source for English-language films - and Nairobi took over as the region 's distribution centre. 130 The new board was also anxious to prove its power over the Indian-run cinema exhibition industry in Tanzania . Marsha pressed charges against the management of Dar es Salaam 's Chox Cinema for failing to cut insulting scenes from the film Call Me Bwana that the film censorship board ( comprised of three wives of prominent African politicians ) had disapproved for public exhibition. 131 Tanzania 's National Assembly often reaffirmed the two major principles of postcolonial censorship : banning negative depictions of Africans and banning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country 's youth. 132 <p> A major break in Tanzania 's censorship policy came with the mainland board 's banning of Goldfinger as anti-Soviet propaganda , shortly before a goodwill trip by Nyerere to the USSR . In doing so , the mainland was following the lead of Zanzibar , which had banned From Russia With Love the year before at the request of the Soviet consulate. 133 The Zanzibar Revolution of January 1964 brought a great increase in African representation on its film censorship board , but practical consideration of censor availability and language skills ensured that the board 's composition did not , at least initially , differ radically from its pre-Revolution membership. 134 The chairman of Revolutionary Zanzibar 's film censorship board was especially keen to reduce the number of Western films in Zanzibar and to increase the number of " Eastern " or communist films. 135 <p> Zanzibar was a heated battleground for Cold War rivalries played out in the cinematic realm . Propaganda films from the U.S. , East Germany , Soviet Union , and China were frequently permitted exhibition in Zanzibar town , but more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influenced widespread support for the censorship board 's decision - one writer agreed that Tanzanians should not follow the steps of developed countries " where youth forms a greater part of trouble-makers. " 137 The censorship board banned the film East of Sudan , a paean to British attempts to end the slave trade in the Sudan in the 1880s , though no reason was given publicly. 138 Sharply sensitive to Cold War policies by 1966-1967 , espionage films such as The Prize , Mission Bloody Mary , The Spy Who Came in from the Cold , and Super Seven Calling Cairo were banned . The open paternalism of colonial censors gave way to more secretive decision-making by their postcolonial successors - neither the board nor its chief censor offered any reason for censoring these films beyond their unsuitability for the " national interest . " 139 But nationalist paternalism associated with the new censorship did not pass unchallenged . Following Marsha 's unexplained banning of spy films , a chorus of complaints arose . One writer argued , " is he Marsha more inured against the temptations of the flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " 140 Filmgoers were particularly distressed that such movies were banned for political reasons , while censors passed films that insulted African nationalist sensibilities , such as the 1964 film Zulu. 141 Male outrage followed the banning of the film Do You Know the Sex at the behest of the woman 's section of TANU , Umoja wa Wanawake wa Tanzania ( UWT ) . Men complained that the film was unfairly judged by UWT , which represented only the excessively prudish sensibilities of their leadership. 142 Cinema for National Development , 1967-1980 <p> Coinciding with attacks on Western and Indian cinema was a reevaluation about the business of cinema in socialist Tanzania . In 1965 , local Asian investors backed by two Bombay film distributors created the Dar es Salaam Film Agencies , which sought to modernize the capital 's theaters as well as form strong links with the major Asian film distributor in Nairobi. 143 On the eve of the Arusha Declaration , the National Development Corporation ( NDC ) announced the creation of a national film distribution company to take over distribution of all commercial films in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's subservience to Nairobi-based film distributors. 144 In late 1967 , the NDC demanded that distributors turn over 10 percent of their revenue for domestic film production. 145 NDC also raised ticket prices , prompting an angry and long-lasting debate about what sorts of film the nation should be importing and what role popular entertainment should play. 146 Nationalist rivalry with Kenya broke out over reciprocity of film distribution by the government-owned Kenya Film Corporation ( KFC ) and NDC. 147 TANU 's daily newspaper celebrated the subsequent purge of these " foreign capitalist distributors " : PREFORMATTED TABLE <p> When a momentary rapprochement between the NDC and 20 th Century Fox fell through on the eve of the premiere of Bonnie and Clyde , the film was immediately banned. 149 In Zanzibar town , the three major theaters - Empire Cinema , Cine Afrique , and Majestic Cinema - were warned to repair their poor seating , remove insect infestations , and filmgoers were warned that those who did not respect the national anthem " will be dealt with severely by the Police . " 150 By this point , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to President Karume 's insistence that Chinese propaganda documentaries replace Indian and Western pictures that dominated local exhibitions , even after making the exhibitions free. 151 <p> This struggle between government officials and local theater owners was conducted in barely concealed racial terms . Indians continued to dominate cinema attendance in postcolonial mainland Tanzania. 152 Of mainland Tanzania 's 31 movie theaters , all but two were owned and operated by " Tanzanians of Asian origin " in 1984. 153 Angry editorials emphasized that Hindi films brought nothing of value to the nation , only licentious love scenes and hooligan behavior. 154 Aside from playing the Tanzanian national anthem before movies , theaters remained aloof from the cultural nationalist project that had come to define other media such as radio and the press . African nationalist resentment directed itself not only against Indian theater owners and film distributors , but also against the routines of urban life , Cinemas made most of their money on Sundays , and did so by exhibiting Indian films to Indian families . Such consumer power had fixed Indian films as the only alternative for Sunday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice in what films should be shown on this day of leisure. 155 One African resident of Dar es Salaam surmised that Indian films on Sunday were designed to keep the urban African out of the theaters and asked " whether this is Dar es Salaam or Bombay . " 156 Despite such resentment , the shared interests of theater owners and the state prevailed - Indian films accounted for 60 percent of Tanzania 's cinema revenues. 157 <p> The putative goal of state control over cinematic exhibition and distribution was to create a local film production industry to serve the needs of nation building . Nationalist leaders embraced the production-enhancing power of educational films , noting the increase in cotton production in rural Tanga following the exhibition of a film that conveyed " new techniques and methods of farming for local developments . " 158 Tanzania 's first state films were simple propaganda - the Tanzania Film Unit 's first production , People 's Choice , showed the 1965 presidential election activities and featured the opening of the National Assembly. 159 In 1969 , TANU 's National Executive Committee declared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruining African culture , and that the remedy to this was to produce local films " which will entertain and educate the people on the policy of local culture . " 160 Subsequent productions relied on bilateral foreign aid. 161 The Danish government supplied over three-quarters of the funding for construction of an Audio Visual Institute that would make films for ujamaa or socialist villages . These films continued to stir excitement in rural areas in the late 1970s - a sign of just how deep the gap between urban and rural entertainment had remained in postcolonial Tanzania. 162 Sidney Poitier and Harry Belafonte visited Tanzania briefly to propose a black production company , but the project never materialized. 163 Demand for the dubbing of films into Kiswahili faltered on the reluctance of the TFC to enter the business without support of Kenya and Uganda. 164 The first of two feature-length productions completed by the TFC was Fimbo ya Mnyonge , a didactic film ( made with Danish assistance ) that warned its viewers against the evils of city life and celebrated the virtues of ujamaa villages. 165 <p> More millenarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The TANU Youth League successfully persuaded the government to ban the promotional guide Film Tanzania in 1970 for its role in spoiling the thoughts of the country 's youth. 166 An Uhuru staff writer supported the banning of James Bond films for their excessive individualism , and hoped that Cuban films celebrating the nationalist and socialist victories in Angola and Mozambique would map the future for Tanzania 's cinema. 167 A National Assembly member celebrated the films of North Vietnam and North Korea that " portray the people 's struggle against imperialism and capitalism " and called for a ban on the " Cowboy " films of the West. 168 In this light , radical youth viewed Indian and American films as a great loss of Tanzania 's limited foreign exchange - of the 60 percent of each film 's net collection given to distributors , the TFC received only 30 percent of this , while " outside " distributors received the remaining 70 percent , payable only with foreign reserves . One youth even celebrated the cancellation of the contract between the Tanzania Film Company Ltd. and Anglo-American Films @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into godowns. 169 <p> Although cinema remained a topic of heated debate in the late 1970s , it also remained " a minority form of entertainment , " with total viewings in the whole of the country ranging from 10,000 to 15,000 per day. 170 Between 1979 and 1982 , the state took 85 million of the 97 million shillings earned from importing foreign feature films , leaving the TFC with inadequate funds for local film production. 171 Public cinema remained a vital part of urban life in Tanzania until the videocassette revolution challenged theaters in the mid-1980s . The state 's response to these technological shifts was slow . In 1999 , the four-person National Film Censorship Board admitted that it had not yet censored its first film for television - which came to mainland Tanzania in 1994 - owing to lack of proper equipment . Indeed , the arrival of television and its instant popularity proved the death knell for Tanzania 's theater business . The last of the colonial-era theaters in Dar es Salaam closed in 2002 , although this blow has been softened by the growing success @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unregulated distribution of pirated films also concerns the Ministry of Health , law enforcement agents , and the National Arts Council , who fear that the sex and violence of these films will lead to a decline of cultural values. 172 This paternalistic impulse appears to have been universal in Tanzania throughout its history . Conclusion <p> The history of film censorship in Tanzania reflects local , regional , and imperial aspirations to social control . The best-known aspect of this story is the plainly racist and paternalist policies of white colonial officials toward African filmgoers . But this is only the most obvious strand in a weave of complex and conflicting imperatives that collectively determined which films and which parts of films were exhibited . While policy statements that prohibited specific types of content roughly set the parameters of cinema censorship , it was ultimately the discretion of local censorship board members that determined the final cuts . The massive inconsistencies of censorship decisions indeed seem more remarkable than the paternalistic nature of the guidelines . Despite sporadic efforts to systematize and later professionalize film censorship through democratizing censorship positions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the unaccountable nature of censorship board appointments and decisions that created the greatest resentment among Tanzania 's film-going public and theater operators . Popular debate turned on who had the authority to decide rather than on what was decided . Popular opinion repeatedly challenged the authority of others to regulate public morality on grounds of cultural difference and educational qualification , particularly the authority of women . <p> Also remarkable in the case of Tanzania was the sub-imperialist role played by its South Asian population . Indians brought to Tanzania 's film experience a heightened sensitivity to religious representation , a demand for equal status with white censors and filmgoers , a claim to an equal role as paternalists to protect Africans from corrupting films , a separate film-watching demographic that called for their own cultural expertise , and an unchallenged predominance over the lucrative cinema exhibition business . The long-simmering resentment of Africans towards Indian privilege proved the most distinctly local manifestation of nationalist politics in Tanzania . Alongside generalized criticisms and rejections of Western cinema and calls to create an authentic African cinema , there were specific challenges to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilient Hindi film-watching population whose cultural isolation and financial muscle were deemed out of step with African socialist and nationalist imperatives . Considerable irony lies in the fact that African nationalists sought to replace the allegedly corrupt and indulgent cinema of India and the West with a dreary run of ham-fisted propaganda films that replicated the coarsest elements of British colonial instructional films . <p> * I would like to thank Ned Bertz , Laura Fair , and Andrew Ivaska for their helpful comments on earlier drafts of this article . <p>
