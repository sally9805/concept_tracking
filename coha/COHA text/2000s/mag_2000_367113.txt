MADELEINE ALBRIGHT is furious  --  and embarrassed . It is bad enough the State Department had to admit that a notebook computer with sensitive material had vanished last January from its ultrasecure internal spy shop after Albright 's inspector general warned about lax security there just months before . Now , intelligence sources tell TIME that the laptop in the Intelligence and Research Bureau contained critical data on weapons proliferation : the spread of missiles and nuclear , chemical and biological weapons . Some of that intelligence came from signals intercepts classified as " Gamma " - level Sensitive Compartmented Information ( SCI ) , two levels above Top Secret . <P> If the laptop has fallen into the wrong hands  --  and not just those of a petty thief  --  it would not only reveal much about what the U.S. knows of the spread of weapons around the world , but also could alert adversaries that the U.S. is spying on them and how . Said a former senior intelligence official : " If it is Gamma , then the fact of its substance being known could also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . " <P> Intelligence sources also said that the laptop may have been missing for two weeks before anyone noticed . After that , another two weeks passed before State 's in-house security service was called in . The congressional committees that monitor intelligence ( and which by law must be informed of potential espionage ) were only notified in mid-April . " Security is synonymous with the conduct of an effective foreign policy , " says Benjamin Gilman , chairman of the House International Relations Committee . " This serious lapse calls that into question . " <P> State 's record is not encouraging . Last year , in another case , FBI agents found a Russian bug in a room that TIME has learned was used by CIA officials to discuss intelligence . And State 's inspector general 's report , produced last September , singled out the Intelligence and Research Bureau for loose handling of SCI material , recommending its control over it be taken away . As for the laptop , the search continues , but hopes are not high . Says a U.S. security official @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , and they may never find it . " Ever more desperate feds are scouring Washington-area pawn shops in the hope that an unknowing thief tried to cash the notebook in . Their fear : foreign spies may beat them to the sale . <P>  --  By Massimo Calabresi and Adam Zagorin/Washington
