Section : Furniture Making A solid maple Shaker-style table that 's simple to build . <p> The hallmarks of Shaker furniture are simplicity , utility , and a sense of craftsmanship that 's nothing less than refreshing in today 's world of shrink-wrap plastic and satellite TV . And , it 's the rare woodworker who does n't take up the challenge to emulate this style , with its classic clean lines and carefully fitted joints . <p> The design of our Shaker-style table is inspired by a piece from the Canterbury Shaker Village in New Hampshire , circa 1840 . While the original was probably a worktable , we see our version used as a console table or sideboard in the dining room . <p> We 've built the table out of solid maple and finished it with stain and shellac for the glow of an authentic antique . And in the spirit of handcrafted woodworking , we 've kept the tools to a minimum - you 'll need only common hand and portable power tools , and a few clamps . We 've even created the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the parts come from 4/4 maple surfaced to 13/16 in. - a standard thickness for hardwood lumber . The table legs are milled from 12/4 stock surfaced to 2 in. , and the drawer sides are cut from 4/4 stock milled to , in. thick . If your hardwood supplier ca n't plane the lumber to your specifications , try a cabinet or millwork shop in your neighborhood . Stock Preparation <p> The first step is to straighten , or joint , the edges of the pieces you 'll glue together to make the wide panels . To do the job with a router , first make a straightedge guide . A 4- or 5-in. - wide piece ripped from the edge of a sheet of plywood or hardboard should work . <p> Clamp the straightedge guide to each maple piece and run the base of the router against the guide to trim the edges of the boards ( Photo 1 ) . <p> Determine the widths of the pieces you 'll need for the tabletop and the side and back panels . Then , use a circular saw with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each piece about 1/16 in. wider than necessary so you can joint the cut edge and remove the saw marks . Crosscut the pieces at least 2 in. longer than the finished panel lengths . <p> While you do n't need them for strength , your assembly will be easier if you use joining plates to align the panels . Mark the locations of the plates and cut the slots ( Photo 2 ) . <p> Apply glue to the mating edges of the panels and also spread glue in the plate slots and plates . Assemble the panels , clamping the joints to pull them tight ( Photo 3 ) . After the glue on each panel has set for 20 to 30 minutes , scrape off any excess . <p> When the glue has completely set , remove the clamps and crosscut the panels to length ( Photo 4 ) . Making The Legs <p> While your circular saw may have the capacity for a 2-in. cut , maple is very hard and can be tough on a saw . It 's best to rip the table legs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the stock , then flip the piece over and finish from the other side ( Photo 5 ) . Repeat for each leg . Rip the leg blanks 1/16 in. wider than finished dimension and use a plane to bring the pieces to correct size . To make shaping the legs easier , leave the leg blanks several inches longer than required . <p> Mark the round-to-square transition points on each leg , and leave at least 2 or 3 extra inches at the bottom end of the blanks for clamping . Clamp one of the blanks to your worktable and use a 1-in. - rad. roundinq-over bit to rout each corner of each leg ( Photo 6 ) . Stop the cuts about in. shy of the transition points . <p> After routing all of the legs , use a gouge or rasps and files to shape the transition between the rounded and square portions of the legs ( Photo 7 ) . <p> Note that the legs wo n't be perfectly round , but will have a small flat surface on each side . When sanded smooth , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a perfect cylinder . Cutting The Joints <p> Lay out and rout the mortises in the legs and square the ends with a chisel ( Photo 8 ) . Then , crosscut the legs to finished length . Locate and cut the plate slots for joining the back and side panels to the legs ( Photo 9 ) . <p> Rip and crosscut the faceframe parts to size , and lay out the mortise-and-tenon joints according to the plan . Rout the mortises in the mullions and the top and bottom rails , and square the ends with a chisel . <p> Install a straight bit in a router table , and use a miter gauge to guide the pieces as you cut the tenon cheeks ( Photo 10 ) . <p> Mark the tenon shoulders on each piece , and use a dovetail saw or backsaw to make these cuts . Test fit each joint . If one is too snug , sand the cheeks until the parts slide together smoothly . If a joint is too loose , glue a veneer shim to the tenon cheek . Assembly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mullion and center-rail tenons ( Photo 11 ) . Assemble the frame , apply clamps , and compare opposite diagonals to see if the frame is square . <p> Next , glue and assemble the leg/face-frame parts ( Photo 12 ) . <p> Glue and clamp the rear leg to the back-panel joints . When the glue has set , lay out the positions of the partitions and joining plate slots . Clamp a straightedge to the back and face frame as a guide for cutting these slots . <p> Apply glue for securing the sides and partitions with the face-frame assembly . Position the panels , clamp them to the frame , and use a square to check that the panels are perpendicular to the face ( Photo 13 ) . Next , join the back-leg assembly to the side and partition panels . Apply clamps and check for square ( Photo 14 ) . <p> Cut the drawer runners to size . Bore and countersink pilot holes in each piece and install them to the side and partition panels ( Photo 15 ) . <p> Mark the locations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Use an 11/16-in. - dia. multispur bit to bore the 3/32-in. - deep recess for each fastener ( Photo 16 ) , then bore pilot holes for the screws and install the hardware . <p> Invert the tabletop on a padded surface and position the base over it with the proper overhang on each edge . Bore holes for tabletop-fastener screws , and attach the top to the base . Drawer Construction <p> Glue up the face , side and back panels for the deep drawers , then rip and crosscut all drawer parts to size . We cut the joints between the drawer sides and faces with a drawer-lock-joint router bit ( Bosch No. 84512M ) . Install the bit in the router table and use it to cut the locking joint on the drawer-face ends ( Photo 17 ) . Since this is a deep cut , take two or three passes to reach the full profile . <p> Readjust the router table to cut the mating joints on the drawer sides ( Photo 18 ) . Clamp a backer board to the trailing edge to prevent chipping . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cut the rabbet at the top and bottom edges of the drawer faces , and the dado in drawer sides for the backs . Then , install a - in. bit and cut the grooves for drawer bottoms . <p> Assemble the drawers with glue and clamps ( Photo 19 ) . When the glue has set , remove the clamps and slide the bottoms in place . Fasten them with screws driven into the drawer backs . Bore pilot holes for the drawer pulls and install them . Finishing <p> Remove the tabletop from the base and sand all table parts to 220 grit . To achieve our golden brown color , we first applied a coat of Hartley Country Maple Gel Stain . Spread the stain with a brush or rag , allow it to set for a few minutes , then wipe off any excess . Allow the stain to dry overnight . <p> Then , apply two coats of Zinsser Bulls Eye amber shellac . Use a good-quality , natural-bristle brush , and avoid excessive brushing . Allow the shellac to dry for at least 2 hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and apply two more coats . <p> Burnish the dry surface with 4/0 steel wool and then buff with a soft cloth . Reattach the tabletop to the base and install the drawers .
