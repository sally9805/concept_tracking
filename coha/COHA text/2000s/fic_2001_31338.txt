Chapter One : Jane The night before I got married I woke up , screaming , from my sleep . My parents came into the room and put their arms around me ; they patted my head and smoothed my hair , fine , and I still could n't stop screaming . Even with my mouth closed , I continued  --  the high , shrill note of a nocturnal animal . My parents were beside themselves . We lived in a button-down suburb of Boston , and we were waking up the neighbors one by one . I watched the lights come on in different houses  --  blue and yellow , blinking like Christmas  --  and wondered what was happening to me . This was n't a common occurrence . I was barely nineteen , a straight-A student fresh out of Wellesley College and in 1976 that was still an accomplishment . I was marrying the man of my dreams in a prototypical white clapboard New England church , and the reception  --  a lavish one with white-gloved waiters and Beluga caviar  --  was going to be held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waiting for me when I returned from my honeymoon . There was no foreseeable problem that I could articulate . To this day , I do n't know why that happened to me . As mysteriously as it all started , the screaming went away and the next morning I married Oliver Jones  --  the Oliver Jones  --  and we just about lived happily ever after . I am the only speech pathologist in this town , which means I get shuttled back and forth to different elementary schools in the San Diego suburbs . It 's not such a big deal now that Rebecca is old enough to take care of herself , and since Oliver is away so much of the time , I have less to do at home . I enjoy my work but certainly not the way Oliver enjoys his work . Oliver would be content to live in a sailcloth tent on the coast of Argentina , watching his whales sound in warm water . My job is to help children find their voices  --  kinds that come to school mute , or with lisps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my little makeshift classroom one at a time and they shuffle their Keds on the floor and shyly glance at the formidable recording equipment and they are absolutely silent . Sometimes I stay silent too , until the student breaks the ice and asks what he or she is supposed to do . Some students cover their mouths with their hands at this point ; I have even seen one little girl cry : they can not stand to hear their own voices , pieces of themselves that they have been told are ugly . My role is to show them there 's someone who is ready to listen to what they have to say and the way they have to say it . When I was seven , I tell these kids , I used to whistle every time I said the letter S. In school I got teased and because of this I did not have many friends and I did not talk very much . One day my teacher told the class we 'd be putting on a play and that everyone had to participate . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I pretended I was sick . I faked a fever by holding the thermometer up to a light bulb when my mother left the room . I was allowed to stay home for three days , until my teacher called , and my mother figured out what I was doing . When I went back to school , my teacher called me aside . All of the parts had been taken in the play , she said , but she had saved a special role for me , offstage . I was going to be the Manager of Sound Effects , just like in the movies . I practiced with my teacher every day after school for three weeks . In time I discovered I could become a fire engine , a bird , a mouse , a bee , and many other things because of my lisp . When the night of the play came , I was given a black robe and a microphone . The other students got to be just one part , but I became the voice of several animals and machines . And my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only time I remember him telling me so . That 's the story I give at those Coastal Studies cocktail parties Oliver and I go to . We rub shoulders with people who 'll give grant money . We introduce ourselves as Dr. and Dr. Jones , although I 'm still ABD . We sneak out when everyone is going to sit down to the main course , and we run to the car and make fun of people 's sequined dresses and dinner jackets . Inside , I curl up against Oliver as he drives , and I listen to him tell me stories I have heard a million times before  --  about an era when you could spot whales in every ocean . In spite of it all , there 's just something about Oliver . You know what I 'm talking about  --  he was the first man who truly took my breath away , and sometimes he still can . He 's the one person I feel comfortable enough with to share a home , a life , a child . He can take me back fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oliver and I have Oliver and I. In this one school where I spend Tuesdays , my office is a janitorial closet . Sometime after noon the secretary of the school knocks on the door and tells me Dr. Jones is on the phone . Now this is truly a surprise . Oliver is at home this week , putting together some research , but he usually has neither the time nor the inclination to call me . He never asks what school I head to on a given day . " Tell him I 'm with a student , " I say , and I push the play button on my tape recorder . Vowel sounds fill the room : AAAAA EEEEEIIIII . I know Oliver too well to play his games . OOOOO UUUUU . Oh , you . Oh , you . Oliver is Very Famous . He was n't when we met , but today he is one of the leading researchers of whales and whale behavior . He has made discoveries that have rocked the scientific world . He is so well known that people take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 've been to the place where Dr. Jones lives . " Oliver 's most important research has been on whale songs . It appears that whole groupings of whales sing the same ones  --  Oliver has recorded this  --  and pass the songs down over generations . I do n't understand much about his work , but that is just as much my fault as Oliver 's . He never tells me about the ideas burning in his mind anymore , and I sometimes forget to ask . Naturally Oliver 's career has come first . He moved us to California to take a job with the San Diego Center for Coastal Studies , only to find out East Coast humpbacks were his true passion . The minute I got to San Diego I wanted to leave , but I did n't tell Oliver that . For better or for worse , I had said . Oliver got to fly back to Boston and I stayed here with an infant , in a climate that is always summer , that never smells like snow . I 'm not taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , period . It is one thing for me to play second fiddle ; it is another thing to see it happen to Rebecca . At fourteen she has the ability to take a survey of her life from a higher vantage point  --  an ability I have n't mastered at thirty-five  --  and I do not believe she likes what she is seeing . When Oliver is home , which is rare , he spends more time in his study than with us . He does n't take an interest in anything that is n't tied to the seas . The way he treats me is one matter : we have a history ; I hold myself accountable for falling in love in the first place . But Rebecca will not take him on faith , just because he is her father . Rebecca expects . I 've heard about teenagers who run away , or get pregnant or drop out of school , and I have heard these things linked to problems at home . So I offered Oliver an ultimatum . Rebecca 's fifteenth birthday next week coincides @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the coast of South America . Oliver intends to go . I told him to be here . What I wanted to say is : This is your daughter . Even if we have grown so far apart that we do n't recognize each other when we pass , we have this life , this block of time , and what do you think about that ? One reason I keep my mouth shut is Rebecca 's accident . It was the result of a fight with Oliver , and I 've been doing my best to keep something like that from happening again . I do n't remember what that argument was about , but I gave him a piece of my mind and he hit me . I picked up my baby ( Rebecca was three and a half at the time ) and flew to my parents . I told my mother I was going to divorce Oliver ; he was a lunatic and on top of this he 'd hit me . Oliver called and said he did n't care what I did but I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action . So I took Rebecca to the airport and told her , " I 'm sorry , honey , but I ca n't stand that man . " I bribed a stewardess with a hundred dollars to take her on the plane , and it crashed in Des Moines . The next thing I knew I was standing in a farmer 's cornfield , watching the wreckage smoke . It still seemed to be moving . The wind sang through the plane 's limbs , voices I could n't place . And behind me was Rebecca , singed but intact , one of five survivors , curled in her father 's arms . She has Oliver 's yellow hair and freckles . Like him , she 's beautiful . Oliver and I looked at each other and I knew right then why fate had made me fall in love with a man like Oliver Jones : some combination of him and of me had created a child who could charm even unyielding earth .                 @ @ @ @
