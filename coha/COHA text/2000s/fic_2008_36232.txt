They were n't making muggers like they used to . <p> After trolling for about an hour through the unseasonably warm May night , here was the second he 'd found  --  or rather had found him . Jack was wearing a Hard Rock Cafe sweatshirt , acid-washed jeans , and his I New York visor . The compleat tourist . A piece of raw steak dangling before a hungry wolf . <p> When he 'd spotted the guy tailing him , he 'd wandered off the pavement and down into this leafy glade . Off to his right the mercury-vapor glow from Central Park West backlit the trees . Over his assailant 's shoulder he could make out the year-round Christmas lights on the trees that flanked the Tavern on the Green . <p> Jack studied the guy facing him . A hulking figure in the shadows , maybe twenty-five , about six foot , pushing two hundred pounds , giving him an inch and thirty pounds on Jack . He had stringy brown hair bleached blond on top , all combed to the side so it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head above the ear and below the part had been buzzcut down to the scalp  --  the Flock of Seagulls guy after a run-in with a lawn mower . Pale , pimply skin and a skull dangling on a chain from his left ear . Black boots , baggy black pants , black Polio T-shirt , fingerless black leather gloves , one of which was wrapped around the handle of a big Special Forces knife , the point angled toward Jack 's belly . <p> " You talking to me , Rambo ? " Jack said . <p> " Yeah . " The guy 's voice was nasal . He twitched and sniffed , shifting his weight from one foot to the other . " I 'm talkin a you . See anybody else here ? " <p> Jack glanced around . " No . I guess if there were , you would n't have stopped me . " <p> " Gim me your wallet . " <p> Jack looked him in the eye . This was the part he liked . <p> " No . " <p> The guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at Jack , obviously unsure of how to take that . <p> " What you say ? " <p> " I said no . En-oh . What 's the matter ? You never heard that word before ? " <p> Probably had n't . <p> His voice rose . " You crazy ? Gim me your wallet or I cut you . You wan na get cut ? " <p> " No . Do n't want to get cut . " <p> " Give it or I stab you in the uterus . " <p> What ? <p> Fighting a laugh , Jack said , " Would n't want that . " He reached into his pocket and pulled out a wad of cash . " I left my wallet home . Will this do ? " <p> The guy 's eyes all but bulged . His free hand darted out . <p> " Give it ! " <p> Jack shoved it back into his pocket . <p> " Nope . " <p> " You crazy fucker  --  ! " <p> As he lunged at Jack , jabbing the blade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him plenty of room to miss . Not that he was worried about any surprises . Most of his type had wasted muscles and sluggish reflexes . But you had to respect that saw-toothed blade . A mean sucker . <p> The guy made a clumsy turn and came back , slashing face-high this time . Jack ducked , grabbed the wrist behind the knife as it went by , got a two-handed grip , and twisted . Hard . <p> The guy shouted with pain as he was jerked into an armlock with his weapon flattened between his shoulder blades . He kicked backward , landing a boot heel on one of Jack 's shins . Wincing with pain , Jack gritted his teeth and kicked the mugger 's feet out from under him . As the guy went down on his face , he yanked the imprisoned arm back straight and rammed his right sneaker behind the shoulder , pinning him . <p> And then he stopped and counted to ten . <p> At times like these he knew he was in danger of losing it . The blackness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to go Mongol on this guy , to take out all his accumulated anger , frustration , rage on this one pathetic jerk . <p> Plenty accumulated during his day-to-day life . And every day it seemed to get a little worse . <p> He knew now the origin of that blackness , where it hid in his cells . But that did n't make it go away or any easier to handle . So when one of these knuckle draggers got within reach , like this doughy lump of dung , he wanted to stomp him into the earth , leaving nothing but a wet stain . <p> A thin wire here , one he Wallenda 'd along , trying not to fall off on the wrong side . Spend too much time there and you became like this jerk . <p> He did a ten count and willed that blackness back down to wherever it lived . Let out his breath and looked down . <p> " Hey , man , " Polio fan whined . " Ca n't you take a joke ? I was only  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure , sure . " <p> The bare fingers opened , the big blade 's handle slipped from the gloved palm and clattered to the earth . <p> " Okay ? I dropped it , okay ? Now lemme up . " <p> Jack released the arm but kept a foot on his back . <p> " Empty your pockets . " <p> " Hey , what  --  ? " <p> Jack increased the pressure of his foot . " Empty them . " <p> " Okay ! Okay ! " <p> He reached back and pulled a ragged cloth wallet from his hip pocket , then slid it across the dirt . <p> " Keep going , " Jack said . " Everything . " <p> The guy pulled a couple of crumpled wads of bills from his front pockets , and dumped them by the wallet . <p> " You a cop ? " <p> " You should be so lucky . " <p> Jack squatted beside him and went through the small pile . About a hundred in cash , a half dozen credit cards , a gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenties , three singles , and no ID . <p> " I see you 've been busy tonight . " <p> " Early bird catches the worm . " <p> " Yeah ? Consider yourself a nightcrawler . This all you got ? " <p> " Aw , you ai n't gon na jack me , are ya ? " <p> " Interesting choice of words . " <p> " Hey , I need that scratch . " <p> " Your jones needs that scratch . " <p> Actually , the Little League needed that scratch . <p> Every year about this time the kids from the local teams that played here in the park would come knocking , looking for donations toward uniforms and equipment . Jack had made it a tradition to help them out by taking up nocturnal collections in the park . <p> The Annual Repairman Jack Park-a-thon . <p> Seemed only fair that the oxygen wasters who prowled the place at night should make donations to the kids who used it during the day . At least Jack thought so . <p> " Let me see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class of mugger over the past few years . Like this guy . Nothing on his fingers but a cheap pewter skull-faced pinky ring with red glass eyes . " How come no gold ? " Jack pulled down the back of his collar . " No chains ? You 're pathetic , you know that ? Where 's your sense of style ? " <p> The previous donor had been better heeled . <p> " I 'm a working man , " the guy said , rolling a little and looking up at Jack . " No frills . " <p> " Yeah . What do you work at ? " <p> " This ! " <p> The guy lunged for his knife , grabbed the handle , and stabbed up at Jack 's groin  --  maybe thinking he 'd find a uterus there ? Jack rolled away to his left and kicked him in the face as he lunged again . The guy went down and Jack was on him once more with the knife arm yanked high and his sneaker back in its former spot on his back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said through his teeth as the blackness rose again . <p> " Hey , listen ! " the guy said into the dirt . " You can have the dough ! " <p> " No kidding . " <p> Jack yanked off the glove and looked at the hand within . No surprise at the tattoo in the thumb web . <p> These guys were starting to pollute the city . <p> " So you 're a Kicker , eh . " <p> " Yeah , man . Totally dissimilated . You too ? You seem like  --  " <p> He screamed as Jack shifted his foot into the rear of his shoulder and kicked down while giving the arm a sharp twist . The shoulder dislocated with a muffled pop , nearly drowned out by the high-pitched wail . <p> He had n't wanted him to finish that sentence . <p> The Rambo knife dropped from suddenly limp fingers . Jack kicked it away and released the arm . <p> " Do n't know about the rest of you , but that arm is definitely dissimilated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt , Jack scooped up the cash and rings . He emptied the wallet and dropped it onto the guy 's back , then headed for the lights . <p> He debated whether to troll for a third donor or call it a night . He mentally calculated that he had donations of about three hundred or so in cash and maybe an equal amount in pawnable gold . He 'd set the goal of this year 's Park-a-thon at twelve hundred dollars . Did n't look like he was going to make that without some extra effort . Which meant he 'd have to come back tomorrow night and bag a couple more . <p> And exhort them to give . <p> Give till it hurt . <p> Excerpted from By the Sword by F.
