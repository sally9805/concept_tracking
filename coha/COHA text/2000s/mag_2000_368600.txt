What 's Next for Napster ? <P> Your very informative article on Napster , the music-file-sharing program TECHNOLOGY , Oct. 2 , drove home one critical point : Napster sends a clear-cut message to the recording industry and also sends a strong edict to the artists themselves . Gone are the days when the consumer was forced to purchase a 15-song album only to end up stuck with 14 mediocre tracks and one stellar one . As people pick and choose music by the song and not the album , recording artists will certainly feel the pressure to provide the consumer with an all-around quality product . One good song out of 15 will no longer be sufficient . TOM ATKINS Sherman Oaks , Calif . <P> In spite of Napster founder Shawn Fanning 's self-portrait as a poor , starving code renegade , the fact remains that his company is a well-financed corporate entity . If you take away the glamour of computer-era hype , what Fanning has done is not new : from the Tin Pan Alley days , businesspeople have sought to rip off artists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used to be small-time hustlers ; today they are glorified on the cover of TIME magazine . ERIC VINCENT Philadelphia <P> For the past 15 years , I 've been trying to track down albums by relatively obscure 1980s bands to no avail . I 'm generally met with blank stares or the usual " It 's out of print . " Napster technology has made it possible for me and thousands of others like me to finally have copies of this material . The record industry long ago declared these bands unprofitable ; they stopped pressing their albums and did not release their work on CDs . Now the companies want to cry foul and claim we 're stealing the music without paying for it . Hey , I would gladly shell out the $15 if the CD were for sale . I shed no tears for the recording industry . The way I see it , they 've left us no alternative .

SUZY MURPHY Cheyenne , Wyo . <P> Musicians and record companies are screaming over the theft of " intellectual property " when what they should be doing is asking themselves how they can better meet the demands of an ever fickle population of music lovers . JULIA L. LANE Canal Winchester , Ohio <P> Like many people our age , we have a large vinyl and tape collection , which , because of children , space , technology , etc. , has been banished to the attic . Using Napster , we can once again listen to the music we already have on vinyl . We have n't downloaded anything we do n't already own on vinyl or tape . Napster has saved us a lot of time and effort in switching to the new technology . MARSHALL AND KATHY LANDIS Baltimore , Md . <P> People seem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incur costs to record CDs , and many people support families with less-than-glamorous jobs to put these albums out . You ca n't convince me that a college student who is able to download a whole CD for free on his computer is still going to run out and purchase that recording . Fanning is a punk who is making money off other people 's labor . TRACY PASEMAN Issaquah , Wash .
