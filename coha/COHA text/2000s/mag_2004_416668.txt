It 's hard to beat the real thing . Despite advances in molding , hydrodynamics , noise attraction and scent impregnation , a man-made lure does n't attract fish as well as bait does . But even bait ca n't guarantee success . Fish have an uncanny ability to unexpectedly suppress their appetites and drive anglers crazy . When that happens , there 's only one solution : chum . Chumming is an established technique that 's most often used in the Mid-Atlantic canyons and Hawaiian Islands for tuna ( using chunks of butterfish and other bait ) and sharks ( using anything and everything to make a slick ) . It 's also employed off tropical reefs for yellowtail snapper ( using sand balls , meal and fish oil ) . But chumming is becoming increasingly popular for a variety of coastal gamefish . When fish are in the vicinity but are reluctant to bite , this instant food supply attracts smaller baitfish , which in turn attract and excite ever-larger predators . Chumming also helps hold gamefish near the boat once feeding begins . It makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere when a steady supply is drifting by ? I often chum in my home waters in the northern Gulf of Mexico . Frozen chum blocks are irresistible treats for lazy , inquisitive cobia , particularly around structure like channel markers or artificial reefs . And there 's no telling what lurks below the steady smorgasbord of by-catch that 's shoveled off shrimp boats as the crews clean their catch each morning . Blacktip sharks , mackerel , cobia and giant jack crevalle are regular visitors at this daily buffet . Serious tournament anglers , like three-time Southern Kingfish Association Angler of the Year Dave Workman Jr. , list chumming as part of their winning strategy . " Chumming brings out the smaller fish and gets the food chain going , " said Workman . " It also helps mask boat scents , like soap residue and outboard oil . I wo n't go anywhere without a case of frozen glass minnows for chum . " Before a tournament , Workman always fills several coolers full of fresh pogies ( menhaden ) that he catches with a cast net . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the boat using a 12-volt grinder and ladles the slurry overboard while slow trolling . He adds to the mix a few live , distressed pogies that are kept in the boat 's baitwell . His other offering is a frozen block of glass minnows that he buys from a tackle store . The frozen minnow block breaks into pieces and attracts hungry fish like bonita . Workman shuns fish oil because of the mess and because it draws sharks and jacks instead of trophy king mackerel . West Coast anglers have also embraced chumming wholeheartedly , said Greg Stotesbury , sales manager for AFTCO tackle company in Irvine , Calif. , and a leading light-tackle expert . Stotesbury uses live sardines and anchovies as chum for tuna , albacore and yellowtails . He also buys scoops of live squid from commercial boats working offshore . After anchoring off the kelp beds where calico and white sea bass congregate , he 'll cut enough still-squirming squid to fill a five-gallon bucket while reserving plenty of live ones for bait . The chummed squid rings attract croakers and blue perch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a hooked live squid as enticement for the bass . When the bass turn on , Stotesbury dumps the remaining cut squid overboard to keep the bass near the boat . " Out here , the most important task of the day is getting live bait on board . Everything else falls into place after that , " he said . Make a mess with a batch of stinky , gooey chum . I can almost guarantee you 'll be pleasantly surprised by the sweet smell of success . CAPT . DAVE LEAR , the former executive director of The Billfish Foundation , who is a professional fishing guide in Florida . Clean Act Chumming is not as messy as it once was . New products like the Chum-King and ChumEase now make it easier and cleaner than ever before . The Chum-King is a durable ABS plastic container with a built-in release mechanism . It has a five-pound capacity and an adjustable weight chamber for various depths and current . It 's easy to operate , too . Add the appropriate number of sinkers ( up to five pounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bait and oil . Sink the Chum-King to the bottom or the desired depth . The boat 's movement , coupled with thawing action , will slowly force the frozen particles out the container 's small vents and into the area . Once the Chum-King is in place , sharply pull on the tether line to partially open the cylinder and release larger pieces of chum . After the chum is released , remove the unit from the water to avoid spooking the fish . Suggested retail price is $30 . Chum-King , ( 877 ) 248-6546. www.chum-king.com . ChumEase is an inexpensive chum bag made of plastic netting material with a drawstring closure . It 's large enough to handle frozen chum blocks and comes in 1/2 " and 3/4 " sizes to disperse different types of chum . Because of its cost ( $1 for a single bag or $4 for a four-pack ) , ChumEase is disposable , although the plastic netting does n't absorb oils , so it can be cleaned and reused .

Her trophy catch also qualified as an International Game Fish Association women 's 80-pound line-class record . Tackle Tip Chum bag residue is stickier than industrial-strength glue . To recycle the bag without attracting every cat within miles , try this cleaning method . Before leaving your last fishing spot of the day , turn the bag inside out , tie it off to a stern cleat with just enough line for the bag to reach the water , and drag it behind the boat while running back in . By the time you pull into the dock at the marina , the bag will be clean . For more information on the products covered here , contact ( 866 ) 626-2846 or **42;1093;TOOLONG .
