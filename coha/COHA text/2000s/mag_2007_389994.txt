This is some of the toughest , toe-to-toe , back-breaking work you 'll ever experience . Big tuna will test your strength as never before . IT WAS JUST AFTER DARK AND A SLIVER of moon shone between the soft clouds as we drifted on the current along the east wall of the Hudson Canyon 80 miles offshore . We 'd been " chunking "  --  paying out a steady stream of butterfish and squid pieces  --  for four hours without a touch when the clicker on one of the 30Ws sounded the alarm . The first tuna of the night had just started tearing line out when another rod was hit . The action continued for two adrenalin-pumping hours . On that night , I learned chunking is some of the toughest back-breaking fishing you 'll ever experience . It 's done from an anchored or drifting boat and the rod is in your hands from the moment a fish takes the bait . If you do n't know how to use the tackle efficiently , big tuna will test your strength as it 's never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island , N.Y. , to the Point off North Carolina come alive with yellowfin that typically run from 30-pound schoolies to 100-pound-plus freight trains . You might also hook up to one of the nastiest fish in the sea  --  a bigeye tuna  --  or even the occasional bluefin , because all three love to snack on chunks when the sun goes down . Start out by getting your hands on the latest satellite sea-surface temperature ( SST ) charts , which will show where water mass boundaries meet . Then , find out where boats have been successful most recently . Chunking is a team effort . Put someone in charge of bait and chum . Four or five flats of frozen butterfish , one or two of squid and a couple buckets of frozen chum will get you through the night . Put another person in charge of tackle . Rigging needs are basic and include a selection of leader material from 40- to 150-pound test , barrel swivels and crimps , 7/0 circle hooks , an ample supply of bank sinkers from 4 to 24 ounces and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plenty of #64 rubber bands to attach sinkers and balloons to your line . A selection of 30- , 50- and 80-pound class stand-up outfits will keep you ready for whatever size tuna you may encounter . Also bring along some light outfits with Sabiki rigs and squid jigs for catching live bait . Fill your fish boxes and a cooler or two with ice . Leave early enough to give yourself some time to scout the area you are planning to fish after dark . Watch your depthfinder and save waypoints for fish readings . These will be spots you 'll want to consider chunking at after dark . Cut up a few flats of bait into bite size pieces and put them in five-gallon buckets . Save the best-looking butterfish and squid whole for hook baits . If sea and current allow it , you can chunk effectively while drifting . If the drift is too fast then anchor in one of the areas you marked earlier , unless it 's too deep for your hook . A windlass is a big help . As soon as you settle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket of frozen chum with holes cut in it over the side and tie it to a springline cleat . Then start paying out chunks in a steady stream , a few pieces at a time until they disappear out of the boat 's spreader or underwater lights . Then toss a few more . Try not to break the rhythm . When the bite starts , someone has to keep the chunks flowing or the tuna will vanish . Fish a couple lines deep with sinkers , getting one on the thermocline and another half-way down . Deep lines can be suspended below balloons and drifted well back in the slick or they can be dangling close to the boat . Have the crew put out working rods  --  outfits baited with whole butterfish or live baits that are continuously being paid out so they drift back with the chunks in a natural manner . Drop them back a hundred yards or so , then reel them in and repeat the process . If you get live bait , use it . Tuna find it hard to pass up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard to get with dead butterfish . When the action gets going everyone should get a shot at fighting fish , but each angler should also be ready to wield the gaff and know how to bleed the fish and collar them after they die before slipping them into the fish box . A good bite may last only minutes , so a crew has to work like a well-oiled machine to put a few fish in the box . Are you ready to rumble ? This is the martial arts form of offshore fishing  --  wimps need not apply . Here 's one last suggestion . If you are expecting a night of hot action you might want to book your appointment with the chiropractor in advance . BOX New Twist Use the Bimini Twist to make double lines for big game . A new finishing technique , shown here , makes it pass through guides more smoothly . To maintain tension on the line , necessary for tying this knot , put the rod and reel you 're using in a rod holder . step 1 : Double over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the loop you want to create . Hold the doubled line and rotate the loop with your other hand , twisting it 20 times for mono or 40 times for superbraids . Then slip the end of the loop over a nearby cleat . step 2 : Pull the tag end out and away at a 90-degree angle . Next , you should slip the pointer finger of your other hand into the loop and push the wraps up as you gradually release some of the pressure on the tag end so it tightly over-wraps the twist . step 3 : Keep the windings firmly in your fingers to prevent them from unraveling and tie a half hitch around one of the legs of the loop . Pull it tight against the base of the twists and give it a tug . step 4 : Finish by tying a reverse uniknot around both legs of the loop as shown and then carefully snug it back up until it joins the base of the twist , locking it and creating a nice smooth transition . step 5 : The finished double line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , add a swivel or a wind-on leader in a loop-to-loop fashion for offshore applications , or tie on a shock leader . Or , tie it directly to a lure for light-tackle work . BOX CLEARLY DIFFERENT Sharp anglers have discovered that invisible leaders increase bites  --  especially in clear water . Hi-Seas Fluorocarbon Leader is extruded from material that has the same light refractive properties as water , so it completely disappears beneath the surface . Available on 25-yard spools or coils from 12- to 330-pound test , it will help increase your fishing success , whether you fish for trout , tuna or anything in between . www.hiseas.net BOX CATCH OF THE MONTH Jody Johnson of Peterborough , N.H. , has set over 50 saltwater and fly world records .
