When Francisco Lopez casts his vote in the presidential election this fall , school vouchers just might be a deal breaker . With the help of two $4,800 publicly funded " scholarships , " or vouchers , Lopez , a father of five , sends two of his daughters to a Roman Catholic girls ' school a few blocks from their home on the south side of Milwaukee , Wis . Rather than place their children across town in the public school system 's gifted program , Lopez and his wife Monica opted for a neighborhood private school that offers smaller classes and better communication between teachers and parents . The Lopezes are so pleased with their family 's three-year experience in the Milwaukee program  --  the oldest and largest U.S. public voucher initiative  --  that they 're reconsidering how to vote . " At first Al Gore was our favorite , " Monica says , but she has heard he is against school vouchers , " so now I 'm not sure who I like . " <P> In an election year when both major-party candidates are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generating the most heated debate  --  and creating the most confusion among voters  --  is school vouchers , a controversial reform that uses tax dollars to help parents send their kids to private schools or hire private tutors . Statewide voucher proposals are on the ballot in California and Michigan . And George W. Bush advocates a federal voucher program that Gore opposes . <P> Bush would take federal aid from poorly performing public schools and give it to low-income parents to apply toward private-school tuition or tutoring . Like other voucher proponents , Bush argues that his plan would force schools to improve by making them compete for families ' money , just as colleges must do . But Bush has stopped using the V word , saying he supports " opportunity scholarships . " That euphemism , pollsters say , evokes fewer negative connotations among voters , who have been told by teachers ' unions and other opponents of vouchers that they would siphon money away from public education . <P> Do vouchers help boost the test scores of children who use them ? Researchers are trying to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Levin , a school-privatization expert at Columbia University , says when students with vouchers are compared with others , " the differences in performance are so small that when people on both sides of this issue are arguing passionately , they 're arguing based on personal beliefs , not evidence . " <P> The best evidence should come from the decade-old Milwaukee program , which has more than 8,000 students . But Wisconsin stopped funding research on the program in 1995 , after John Witte , a politics professor at the University of Wisconsin , found no difference in test scores between students who used the vouchers and a sample of Milwaukee public school students . Witte did note , however , that parents who used the vouchers were generally more satisfied with their children 's schooling than other parents were .
