Forget the accounting scandals , the CEOs fending off fraud charges , the churning stock market . The business world has become obsessed with corporate nuptials . Merger mania is back , executives are cashing out and , if history is any guide , investors should be running for cover . A couple of months ago , Kmart and Sears got engaged . Then Nextel and Sprint announced their $35 billion wedding . Johnson &; Johnson is buying Guidant , a maker of medical devices , for $24 billion . Two of the splashiest deals came last week : SBC , the Baby Bell based in San Antonio , Texas , looked poised to swallow its former parent , AT &T,; in a deal that could top $15 billion . Then Procter &; Gamble said it would acquire Gillette for $57 billion , forging a consumer-products giant with brands ranging from Gillette 's Right Guard deodorant and Mach3 razors to P &G's; Crest , Pampers and Tide . <P> For all the talk of profits and synergies , investors would be wise to view these deals with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stockholders of the acquiring company . In seven of the nine mergers valued at more than $50 billion , the acquirer 's share price is down an average of 46% from premerger levels , according to FactSet Mergerstat , a research firm in Santa Monica , Calif . Maybe you already knew that if you 're a longtime owner of Hewlett-Packard , whose stock has flatlined since the company acquired Compaq in 2002 . AOL 's merger with Time Warner ( parent company of TIME ) may have set a new standard of paired futility , erasing some 80% of the merged company 's stock value . After the hype subsides , more often than not , investors wind up with tax write-offs.
