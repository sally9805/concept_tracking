Bayliner 's new 2855 Ciera Sunbridge delivers fluid exterior styling , a well-proven Sequential Lift hull design , and complete cruise accommodtions in an easy-to-buy package . Photograph Photograph // Admiralty Inlet was boiling with tightly-packed standing waves in between Puget Sound 's Whidbey Island and the Olympic Peninsula , and it seemed like we were headed into tidal hot water . Kelly Boren , a senior industrial design engineer for US Marine , saw it coming and instinctively stood at the helm to prepare himself for what could be a rough ride in some boats . Jerry Stansfield , US Marine 's director of marketing communications , and I were seated to his left on the very comfortable , innovative L-shaped bench seat . NVe chose to sit it out , partly because we were interested in the kind of ride seated passengers might experience on Bayliner 's new 2855 Ciera Sunbridge when the going gets bumpy , and partly because this was the tried-and-true Sequential Lift Hull design , which we both knew would make short work of ultra-choppy water . Before we plunged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then did two things I did n't expect . First , he reached down and flipped up the leading edge of the bench seat , creating a comfortable leaning post support for standing at the helm . And second , like a prize fighter preparing to strike , he stepped backward just a bit with one foot for better balance and control of his fore-and-aft movement What 's remarkable about the latter is that part of the console on which the bench seat is mounted had been carved away , molded to provide heel relief-one of many subtle changes in the grand scheme of overall design that make the new 2855 Ciera Sunbridge a worthy successor to Bayliner 's previous 28-footer .

FAMILY CRUISING : Sleeps six in forward , mid-cabin and convertible dinette berths . // " Our earlier 28 Ciera was in the line for seven to eight years , and it was enormously popular-a best seller , " Stansfield said . " It quickly became the responsibility of the designers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ platform team similar to those in the auto industry , to improve the package without straying from the original concept . " Before long , we rounded Point Hudson and headed slightly southwest , hugging the shoreline below Port Townsend 's high bluffs . Here the water was smooth and unruffled , and the 2855 Ciera glided along like a plane at a high cruising altitude . Moving away from the shoreline briefly to give the outbound ferry clear room to maneuver , we headed in to the Port Townsend Boat Haven . When the boat was safely tied in the slip , and the standard 50-ft. , 30-amp power cord was locked into the dock power receptacle , we flipped on the optional air conditioner and left the boat for a bit of exploration . Well known regionally for its vast collection of Victorian homes , the city also has more than a dozen larger buildings which are well preserved ; the Carnegie Library , the U.S. Post Office , and The Rose movie theater to name just a few . This area truly lends itself to the living history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a relatively easy run from Seattle to the south and Anacortes to the north , it would readily fit into a cruising family 's summer vacation plans .

Originally named " Port Townshend " by Captain George Vancouver ( for his friend the Marquis of Townshend ) in 1792 , Port Townsend was recognized as a good , safe harbor . It became an official settlement almost 60 years later , on the 24th of April , 1851 . From the mid- to late-1800 's , Port Townsend was a wellknown seaport , wealthy and prosperous . Many ornate Victorian homes and buildings were constructed during that time . It became known as the " City of Dreams " because of the early speculation that they would have the largest harbor on the west coast . But when other Puget Sound ports began growing , and when the Northern Pacific Railroad failed to connect the city to the eastern Puget Sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1890 's . Because there was little growth or development in Port Townsend for many years , most of the original structures from that era have survived . Walking along Water Street among the beautifully-maintained Victorian buildings , Jerry Stansfield and I discussed the 2855 Ciera as a transitional motoryacht , a step-up from trailerable mid-sized family cruisers on the way to beamy , inboard yachts . This New Generation Ciera , as Bayliner calls it , provides generous cruising accommodations for four to six persons , genuine standing headroom in the cabin and head compartment , wide-beam comfort above and below decks , and all the necessities for longer-range ( read " more than a weekend " ) cruising in a single-engine motoryacht . Want twin engines ? Forget about it . Using a single MerCruiser stem drive system takes a lot of weight out of the boat , which lowers the purchase price and improves economy . And it performs very nicely , too . Our test boat was the LX version , available with a nice package of convenience features ( I 'll get to those in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard DX model is available with a single 250-hp MerCruiser 5.7L/Alpha I stern drive system that cruises efficiently at 20.4 mph buming 11.9 gph , or tops out at 33.3 mph burning 20.7 gph . For those who need a little more speed and a little less time between ports , the LX model has an available 310-hp , 7AL MerCruiser/Bravo III that cruises at 26.6 mph burning 13.8 gph and can clip along at wide open throttle speeds of 37 mph burning 26.4 gph . Obviously , you may get slightly different performance depending on boat loading , local conditions , degree of maintenance , and other factors . Compared to its predecessor , the 2855 Ciera Sunbridge seems like a much bigger boat . The swim platform is noticeably larger , with a deep , three-rung ladder for easier boarding and a new stowage locker in the transom wall for fenders and lines . The boat is wired standard for twin batteries , and the selector switch is located in this locker for ease of access . The swim platform extends aft beyond the sculpted bustle of the side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back in and tie up . Photograph SUNNY SEATING : Four adults can enjoy the unobstructed view from the bridgedeck . GREAT GALLEY . Includes an origo cooktop , AC/DC refrigerator , and microwave ( LX ) . // The full height transom and lockable door to starboard will give owners a sense of security when younger guests or family members are moving around in the aft cockpit . The transom bench seat folds down when you need access to the large engine room hatch recessed in the cockpit sole , or when you need a little extra room for toting items like inflated water toys . Bayliner provides a recessed socket for a removable table , perfect for dining in the cockpit . Great ideas abound On the bridge deck , Bayliner 's designers have been busy . The innovative L-shaped SunChaiser lounge is configured to offer aft-facing seating as well as stretched-out sun-lounging . And tucked into the recess below , you 'll find a removable 48-qt . Igloo cooler within easy reach . There are large steps leading up to an opening center windshield section for easy access @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the centerline and a well-defined toerail for improved footing , as well as easy access to the selfstoring anchor platform and large rode locker , which is prewired for a windlass . Beginning with the steps leading down into the cabin , which are covered with a long-lasting , easily-maintained vinyl surface , the 2855 Ciera Sunbridge interior is loaded with good ideas . First and foremost is the enclosed mid-cabin , which has a solid bulkhead and a door for privacy . Just inside the door , there 's standing headroom for dressing , a hanging locker , and room to get in and out of the berth easily . The angled headboard flips open for storage ( there 's more storage at the foot of the berth , as well ) , and the area is well-suited for sitting up and reading . Natural ventilation and lighting are excellent below . Large windows run uninterrupted along the cabin sides for an uninterrupted view of local waters , while three hatches overhead and four opening portlights provide natural ventilation . A full galley comes complete with a stainless steel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ converts to another double , and there 's a large Vberth forward with privacy curtain . The head compartment is a single molded unit with an integral medicine cabinet and vanity , which increases structural integrity , eliminates those hard-to-clean tight corners typical of built-up units , and ultimately means there are fewer components to come loose and rattle over time . That 's just one example of the fit and complexity made possible by Bayliner 's five-axis router and digital computer aided design and manufacturing software . Committed to qualty Bayliner 's commitment to computerized design and manufacturing advantages help them resolve problems that once added months to the development of new models . " In order to achieve the goals needed for serial production , issues of manufacturing become large as you add features , " Stansfield said . " Tooling must be well thought out , so our platform team of designers , engineers , and manufacturing specialists address these problems early in the process , an interdisciplinary approach which is centered on the computer aided design process . With cross sections from our extensive database , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team to effect changes that bring new ideas for the design on-line quicker and more efficiently . " Former methods were far more timeconsuming . The traditional design ran from plug-building to first prototype , then from modification to subsequent prototypes until a balance was achieved between performance and livability considerations . Sometimes the results were far less than satisfactory because of other design factors inevitably crept into the process further downstream . And even though the modification process will , by its very nature , continue to be a part of the design process , the differences in time lost can be minimized . With our computerized design and manufacturing processes , and our five-axis router , the fit-and-finish tolerances , as well as the time from design to launch , are growing closer every time . " Advanced 5-15 biaxial knits , customfabricated to Bayliner 's specs , are used in the sides for stronger lamination and improved cosmetics . They have the same effect as coring , providing a high strength-to weight lamination without the bulk of core materials or woven roving . Woven roving , which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impact resistance , so Bayliner 's designers specify it for the hull bottom panels , where it 's needed the most . Stringers are cored fiberglass structures , with significant metal brackets where the motor mounts . Designers also increased the fuel tank by 20 gallons , and improved the fuel system so that it can be refilled at high-speed pumps without constant stopping to prevent backflows. ftc to please Bayliner 's new 2855 Ciera Sunbridge continues their tradition of leadership in standard equipment , features and value .
