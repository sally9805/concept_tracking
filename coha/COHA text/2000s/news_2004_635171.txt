<p> Eighty-nine-year-old Anne Pfrenger vividly remembers the day in 1935 when she met her future husband at a German Day celebration in a Riverview park picnic grove  --  right down to the oom-pa-pa music they waltzed to and his wavy blond hair , maroon suit and gray spats . <p> " That was the start of something , " she said . <p> And how . <p> A decade later , they were taking their kids to the North Side amusement park . Daughter Carol Lutz remembers always scrambling to find her " special horse " on the merry-go-round . <p> And by the mid-1960s , Lutz and her husband were bringing their kids to Riverview . Their daughter , Cindy Ribbens , 40 , has sketchy memories , vague images of being frightened as she looked up at the towering turbaned head in front of the Aladdin 's Castle funhouse as a toddler . <p> Riverview was that kind of a place , a joyful , special , exhilarating  --  and occasionally terrifying  --  slice of summer in Chicago handed down from one generation to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The World 's Largest Amusement Park " opened at Belmont and Western . By the time it closed in 1967 , an estimated 100 million people had pushed through its turnstiles . <p> " They were kind of the Disney World-Six Flags of its era , " said Jim Futrell , historian with the National Amusement Park Historical Association . " It was just amazing the variety of rides and attractions they had . " <p> Just as amazing are the memories left behind  --  some fuzzy , like wisps of cotton candy , others as sharp as the screams coming from the park 's seven roller-coasters . <p> " I can remember the whole place like it was yesterday , " said William Hargrave , 47 , a real-estate salesman who lives on the Near North Side . " Sneaking off with my older brother on the No. 11 bus  --  unbeknownst to our family  --  the Lincoln Avenue bus . <p> " I remember the Bobs , the Fireball , the Shoot the Chutes , the Pair-O-Chute ride , the Wild Mouse , " said Hargrave , stepson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best roller-coasters were the Bobs and the Fireball . They were the fastest . And on the Fireball , you 'd go down the first drop , would go right into a tunnel , and it would look like your head was going to hit the tunnel . It was quite cool . <p> " It was a place where my father grew up going , it 's a place where I grew up going , " Hargrave said . " My mother went there as a little girl . And my stepfather , Bill Wirtz , used to go there as a kid . <p> " It was just a wonderful , wonderful place , a carnival atmosphere in the heart of the city . " <p> Like all carnivals , some of the memories are seamier . The seedy penny arcade , the " Freak Show , " the dunk tanks that served up racism at the price of three balls for a quarter . <p> But most are as warm and sunny as a July afternoon . Two-Cent Day and Five-Cent Night . Park spokesman Dick " Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troubles away . " The stolen kisses in the picnic grove and Tunnel of Love . And that wonderful carousel . <p> " I had a special horse , " Lutz said . " I thought it was mine . And the music . I think it 's called the calliope . It was just paradise . It was just magic . It was perfect . " <p> It was Riverview . <p> ' Nothing but Fun ' from the start <p> Western Avenue was a dirt road lined by wooden sidewalks with deer still scampering along the banks of the nearby North Branch of the Chicago River when Riverview opened its gates . <p> It was originally called Riverview Sharpshooters ' Park , after the German marksmen who initially owned the wooded area bordered by Belmont , Western , Roscoe and the river . The club of Prussian War veterans used the land for target practice , picnics and beer-drinking . <p> After the club disbanded at the turn of the century , former member Wilhelm Schmidt , a wealthy commercial baker , bought the land with a partner and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Schmidt , talked him into turning it into an amusement park after seeing similar venues in Europe . <p> And on July 2 , 1904 , Riverview Sharphooters ' Park barged onto the scene like one of its famous carnival barkers . " Most Complete and Attractive Amusement and Recreation Park in America , " newspaper ads proclaimed . " An avalanche of novelties . A whirlwind of surprises . An ideal outing place . ... Nothing but Fun . " <p> From goat carts to sea battles <p> Five years later , a 23-year-old draftsman and electrical engineering student named John S. Reid Jr . brought his camera to the park , and described it in detail to a friend in upstate New York in a 34-page letter dotted with 80 tiny postage stamp-sized photographs . <p> " Are you ready to start on a trip to the ' largest amusement exposition in the world '  --  Riverview Park ? " Reid wrote to Hilda Sweet of Ithaca , N.Y , in July of 1909 . " We shall start immediately . " <p> Reid went on to describe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is on file at the Chicago Historical Society . Reid told of rides in goat carts , a merry-go-round " well patronized by the younger people , " fortune tellers plying their trade in " Temples of Palmistery , " a " mesmerist " levitating a woman outside the sideshow , a miniature railway and rides called the " Merry Widow , " the " Whirlpool , " the " Aquarousel " and the " Velvet Coaster . " <p> But he was most taken by a re-enactment of the Civil War battle at sea between the Monitor and the Merrimac . <p> " Inside the building is a large stage on which the famous battle is enacted many times a day to the accompaniment of much noise and smoke , " Reid wrote . " The vessels taking part in the mimic engagement are of miniature size , but thru the perspective of magnificently painted and splendidly lighted scenery they appear as full-sized craft so that the spectacle is very realistic . <p> " The waves on the painted ocean are produced by imparting an up and down motion to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A marriage made in Riverview <p> Pfrenger was 10 when she came to Chicago from Germany with her family in 1925 . About two years later , she made her first visit to Riverview , the first of 100 to 200 she estimates she made over the next 40 years . <p> " We lived about half a mile from Riverview , " she said . " When we were kids , we went almost five times a week , if not more . That was the thing to do . " <p> But the visit she remembers most clearly was that German Day celebration in 1935 . A secretary dolled up in one of her nicer dresses , she spotted Eric Pfrenger . <p> " Quite a good-looking guy , " she recalled . " I liked him right away , and I guess he liked me , so I stood my girlfriends up . " <p> Two years later they wed , beginning a marriage that would last until her husband died in 1996 . " We had a very happy marriage , " said Pfrenger , 89 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> No atheists on the Pair- O-Chutes <p> The park featured more than 100 rides and other attractions on 74 acres in its final season . The Bobs , the stomach-churning wooden roller-coaster built in 1926 , was always the king . It attracted 700,000 riders every year . <p> " I was 10 or 11 before I worked up the courage to ride the Bobs , " said Chuck Wlodarczyk , 67 , author of Riverview : Gone But Not Forgotten , 1904-1967 . " The greatest roller-coaster I have ever ridden . ... It was a non-stop , Katie-bar-the-door ride . I mean , you held on for dear life . " <p> The park 's other real nail-biter was the Pair-O-Chutes . Riders rode nearly to the top of a 212-foot tower and then parachuted down . Countless Chicagoans tell stories about getting stuck in mid-air on the way up . But Wlodarczyk says that was part of the schtick . <p> " If the operator saw your girlfriend or wife was a little apprehensive about getting on it , they would get you near the top , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for 10 or 15 seconds , " he said . " Of course , if you were up there , you felt like it was 10 or 15 minutes . <p> " And the operator would yell , ' Do n't worry . We 'll get a ladder and get you down . ' " <p> But Bob Karlic , 63 , Lutz 's ex husband , insists he got stuck for at least 30 minutes when he was a teenager . <p> " There we were dangling on about a 30-degree angle , and this guy just went into tears , " Karlic said of one of his friends . " He said , ' If I die , you will have to explain this to my mother . ' " <p> Life lessons over hot dogs <p> Sitting on a bench eating hot dogs and talking with her two brothers in 1944 while they waited for the rides to reopen for the evening : That 's the memory Pierrette Biancardi cherishes . <p> Her older brother , Roland , was home on furlough from World War II , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 12-year-old brother Richard  --  to Riverview . They arrived during the park 's dinner break . <p> " I remember we had a wonderful talk , " Biancardi said . " He talked to us about getting educated . He never had much education . I do n't remember having that kind of talk with him before that . " <p> The next day her brother 's furlough ended . Later that year , he was killed in the Battle of the Bulge . <p> " It 's always been a nice way to remember him , " said Biancardi , 72 , a retired registered nurse , who lives in Angola , Ind . " Sometimes you do n't even get a chance to say goodbye . But we had sort of a celebration by going to Riverview . We got to tell him goodbye . " <p> Biancardi won second place in a 1967 Sun-Times contest asking people to share their Riverview memories . She won $50 and a funhouse mirror from Aladdin 's Castle . " It 's on my sun porch right now , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't part with it . " <p> ' You could die there ' <p> Playwright David Mamet once wrote " The great thing about Riverview is that you could die there . " <p> And people did . <p> Newspapers touted the park 's safety record , considered one of the best at the time . <p> " Riverview Park So Safe , It 's Almost Frightening ! " read a newspaper headline in 1961 . <p> But at least 18 were killed in accidents or mishaps at the park over the years  --  two in the park 's final season . <p> Riverview had other dark moments . <p> Its penny arcade was the site of the 1939 " Riverview torture case , " in which at least six teenage boys accused workers of abusing them by forcing them to do deep-knee bends until they passed out . Some said they were strung up by their thumbs if they refused . <p> A few German Day celebrations at the park got ugly before the United States entered World War II . Some park visitors cheered Adolf Hitler 's name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> And there was the now unfathomable " African Dip , " essentially a dunk tank featuring only African Americans . Black men in clown suits taunted passers-by with insults , and the white patrons responded by hurling baseballs  --  often along with racial slurs . <p> Differing accounts credit either the NAACP or columnist Mike Royko with getting the park to end the concession in the late ' 50s or early 1960s . <p> Reached in Florida , the son of longtime owner of the concession George F. Starr refused to share his memories . " I just do n't care to talk about it , " Starr 's son said . " It 's closed . It 's gone . It 's done . " <p> Timuel Black , 85 , an African-American political activist and retired social sciences professor , said despite the racist game , Riverview had a reputation for being open to people of all races . <p> " Riverview always welcomed everyone , it seems , " Black said . " We had some feelings about them throwing things at black targets . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that part of the show . <p> " But for me , I have very fond memories . I did n't stop going up until it closed . " <p> Historian Dempsey Travis , 84 , author of An Autobiography of Black Chicago and 24 other books , agreed , saying he began going to the park when he was 5 years old . <p> " It cast a light shadow over Riverview , but it does n't demean it , " Travis said of the African Dip . " Just to get off the streetcar and walk through those gates was a thrill in itself . " <p> ' The Armless Wonder ' <p> Professional magician Marshall Brodien , 69 , can still recite the pitches he uttered half a century ago to draw people into the sideshow when he worked as its barker . <p> " Terra Sue , the Mystery Girl from India ; the Hindu fakir ; the Anatomical Wonder ; the Man With the Disappearing Stomach ! The Rubber-Skinned Man ! Watch him stretch his skin 14 inches away from his body , let it snap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body into more shapes than a pretzel ! <p> " We had the fat man , we had the armless wonder  --  did everything with his feet . Operate a typewriter , paint with oil color , thread a needle and sew , shuffle and deal a deck of playing cards , play musical instruments . " <p> Such shows have virtually disappeared , considered politically incorrect and an exploitation of the disabled , but Brodien , who later played Wizzo the Wizard on " Bozo 's Circus , " makes no apologies . <p> " The four-legged girl was born in Georgia from a real poor family , " Brodien said . " She bought her mother a new home . She put her brothers and sisters through college with the money she made . Now , a person in her condition , they wo n't let ' em do it any more , and it 's sad . <p> " The Armless Wonder . What would be the best thing for him to do ? Sit in a corner and beg for money or something ? He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were amused and mystified by how he could do these things . " <p> Tears , anger , bitterness <p> When the park suddenly closed about a month after the close of the 1967 season , Chicago took it like the death of a favorite relative . <p> " I remember being in tears when they announced they were shutting the park down , " Hargrave said . " No more family outings to Riverview . And no more sneaking off with my older brother to Riverview . <p> " It was a great tragedy . It was a huge disappointment . " <p> The investment banker who bought the park for commercial development received death threats . <p> Riverview was sold Oct. 3 , 1967 , after one of the investors died , and his heirs and some of the other shareholders accepted an offer of about $6.5 million . William Schmidt , grandson of the founder , objected , but he held less than 15 percent of the stock . <p> " Bill Schmidt , who ran it at the time , was very bitter about how the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profile for the rest of his life , " said historian Futrell . <p> Schmidt died June 21 , 1993 , in Florida , leaving no survivors , Derek Gee and Ralph Lopez wrote in Laugh Your Troubles Away : The Complete History of Riverview Park . Apparently there were no obituary notices of his death . <p> ' I remember it the way it was ' <p> Today , Riverview 's former site is home to the Area 3 Police Headquarters , the DeVry Institute of Technology , a couple of supermarkets , a Blockbuster video outlet and a handful of other shops . <p> The carousel , whose riders included President Warren G. Harding and Al Capone , wound up in Six Flags Over Georgia  --  although three of the hand-carved wooden horses disappeared along the way . Most of the other rides were sold for scrap . <p> Behind DeVry in a woody stretch near the river , a huge ring of concrete and a long narrow trough  --  remnants of long-demolished rides  --  remain nearly buried in the dirt and fallen leaves . Patches of pavement said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peek through the weeds . <p> The only thrill-seekers are kids riding their bicycles and skateboards up and down a series of small hills in the woods . <p> " I always wondered if I wandered along the riverbanks , if I could dig something up , " said Ribbens , who has tried to spark her few childhood memories by conducting research and listening to the stories of her grandmother and mother . <p> Her mother was so upset about the park 's closing that she refused to go watch any of the demolition , even though she still lived within walking distance at the time . <p> " I 'm glad I did n't go see it , " said Lutz , 62 , now a clerical worker in Felton , Calif .
