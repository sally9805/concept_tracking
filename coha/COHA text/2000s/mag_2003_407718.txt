Designer Kenneth Cole opens the door to his Westchester , New York , home-where casual and elegant go effortlessly side by side By Jennifer Alfano // Photographed by Fernando Bengoechea Politics and fashion typically do n't mix well , but if you happen to be Kenneth Cole , it could n't be a more proven recipe for success . Having married into a political dynasty-his wife , Maria Cuomo Cole , is the daughter of former New York governor Mario Cuomo-he also counts Bobby Kennedy Jr . and Bill Clinton as friends . And somehow he has succeeded in combining social activism with selling his sleek urban shoes , clothes and coats . " For Kenneth , work is not just about making money , but making a point , " says longtime friend Kennedy , who credits the success of Cole 's company to this quality . Kennedy made evident his admiration for the designer years ago when he " practically had to go to the Vatican " to get permission for Cole ( who is Jewish ) to become the godfather of one of his children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he would certainly be played by Harrison Ford . He 's attractive in that raffish , slightly disheveled manner ; he is fiercely loyal to his family and immensely private ; he fights for just causes , serves as a vice-chairman of the American Foundation for AIDS Research ( amfAR ) and made AIDS-not shoes-the subject of his label 's inaugural ad campaign . Maria , in turn , would be perfectly played by Anne Archer . Beautiful and no-nonsense , she has inherited her father 's commitment to the social good . She serves as chair for HELP USA , a nonprofit organization that provides housing and clothing to the homeless and others in need . Indeed , together they are the only couple in the fashion industry who could feasibly become the first couple some day . But for now they are content to be a surprisingly normal pair who just happen to live on a few idyllic acres in Westchester County , New York , in a gleaming Stanford White-designed home filled with surrealist paintings-all made possible because Cole just happens to run a billion-dollar worldwide fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grand stature of their Dutch Colonial ( the kitchen is the size of an average New York apartment ) is offset by the coziness and unassuming nature of its interiors . It 's a functional home often filled with family and friends . Although the Coles occasionally open it up for civic concerns or political charities , entertaining is almost always done family-style , their three daughters included . This informal way of life dictates the laid-back nature of the furnishings . Sure , there is a museum-worthy painting in the drawing room , but there are also comfortable chairs for lounging and watching videos on the screen that drops down from the ceiling in front of the priceless artwork . Family pictures line the staircase walls , a quaint wooden playhouse sits on the side lawn and tire swings dangle from an oak tree . The only details that hint at Cole 's empire are the Andy Warhol shoe sketch in the entry hall and a collection of antique shoes in the designer 's first-floor office . Despite the home 's vintage nuances , Cole is a true techno buff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on-the-move CEO : a cell phone , BlackBerry and the latest Sony digital camera , which he uses to deliver video-stream e-mails to his staff . " Why should you send a written e-mail that says , " Have a nice weekend , " when you can say it face-to-face ? " he asks , clearly more comfortable expounding on the cool wizardry of gadgets than discussing his business . As he writes in his new book , Footnotes : What You Stand For Is More Important Than What You Stand In ( Simon &; Schuster ) , " If every shoe store in America closed its doors tomorrow , hardly an American would go barefoot for at least 11 years . " At this point in his career , you 'd think that Cole would relax and enjoy the fruits of his labors-his company had net revenues of $433 million last year . Not so . " I 'm not done yet , " he says , adding that writing this book was akin to " coming out of a Broadway musical at intermission and telling someone about the show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his signature socially conscious ad campaigns , Cole is not interested in global domination . " Nobody needs what I have to sell , " he says with a grounded quality uncharacteristic of the fashion industry . " There are no consumers with empty closets . " Cole began designing shoes in 1976 for his father , Charles Cole , who owned the El Greco shoe factory in Brooklyn and brought Candie's-that ultimate ' ' 70s footwear fetish-to the United States . Of those vertiginous wood-heeled slides , Cole says with a laugh : " We were probably responsible for crippling half a generation with those shoes . But they were disposable and they looked good . " Cole learned from his father that if you could create a hip , affordable shoe , you could be sitting on a gold mine . " Footwear affects how you look and feel , " says Cole . " It has a lasting impact on your day . " That philosophy helped create the Kenneth Cole enterprise that now encompasses womenswear , menswear , accessories , fragrance and , of course , shoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the social signifiers of the rarefied fashion cognoscenti , but everyone from city-slick young professionals to stay-at-home soccer moms can relate to and afford Cole 's designs . " His clothes are urban and suburban , " says Kal Ruttenstein , senior vicepresident for fashion direction at Bloomingdale 's . " They are n't too avant-garde . They fill a certain void . " Of course , Cole does n't see success : He sees room for improvement . " I think we could make the women 's collection better , make it more cohesive , " he says , clarifying that he would like to expand it to include more sportswear and eveningwear . He also admits to toying with the idea of a home line but says he 'll take his time : " I 'm so obsessed with being consistent , I do n't want to spread myself too thin . " " The strength of the men 's collection is that it 's all Kenneth , " says Maria . So , does that mean the women 's collection is a reflection of her tastes ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the women in his life , " she says diplomatically . Asked if the ladies of the house inspire his designs , Cole pauses and smiles , " Hmm ... I do n't want to get myself into trouble here . Let 's just say Maria and my girls are very clear in telling me what they like and do n't like . " There is nothing like the unadulterated opinion of a teenager to let you know exactly where you stand , and he can count on his wife as the ultimate voice of reason . Even with a wardrobe that includes Oscar de la Renta , Carolina Herrera , Michael Kors , Marc Jacobs and none other than Kenneth Cole , Maria keeps reality in check : " Fashion has now become more about wearing clothes that work for my business or as a mother , " she says with a shrug as she heads out the door to catch her youngest daughter in her school play . In the Coles ' home , fashion is just a part-not a way-of life .
