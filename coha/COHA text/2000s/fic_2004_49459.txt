I count my steps because I have a boring and unhappy life . Each day , I walk to my job at the factory , placing one foot in front of the other and assigning a number for each step . It calms me , helps make life tolerable . I have walked from the apartment I share with my brother all the way to the factory in only seven thousand and forty-five steps . Each day I try out new paths , taking longer strides , choosing my steps carefully . It is a game , albeit a pathetic and queer game , that provides me with some kind of happiness . Thinking in sequence gives time meaning . It keeps me from exploding . It fills my head for a while , keeps me from thinking unhappy thoughts , before I wait in a queue outside the factory and file into the sorting room , where it rains letters of the alphabet for eight hours . <p> I am a sorter at the Scrabble factory , the primary producer of Scrabble tiles for the Hasbro Corporation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each one filled with one hundred workers who sort through a mountain of wooden tiles that fall in clumps from an overhead chute . At several times during the day , a large blue light flickers on and off , accompanied by a siren 's wail , and all the workers stop their sorting , pick themselves up off their hands and knees , and watch A 's and J 's and R 's fall all around them , making tic-tic sounds like a thousand typewriters going at once . I wade around in the alphabet , up to my knees , and search for Q 's . It is not a glamorous job . <p> In every packaged game of Scrabble , there is one Q. There hides inside each game only one opportunity for a quack or a quarter or a quibble . In a ratio , for every one hundred letters , there is only one Q. So , sorting through a thousand tiles will only leave me with ten Q 's , and since we are paid only a tiny hourly wage and are given a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is understandable why I do not like my job . Women get the worst letters . We handle the J 's , the Z 's , the K 's . I have been collecting Q 's for five years , since I was twenty years old , and even though I have become quite good at it , I run my hands over the wooden tiles and touch the E 's and N 's and A 's with the tips of my fingers and dream of holding them , of carrying them inside my shoulder bag . <p> Today , I manage to find fifty-three Q 's . Yesterday I found forty ; two days before that I found sixty-three . Like most good sorters , I 'm able to Braille my Q 's , dipping my hands into a sea of letters and moving my fingertips over the tiles until I can feel a Q. It 's a lot easier than turning over each tile and then tossing it aside . Everyone is moving quickly , running to one area and pulling up handfuls of tiles before moving to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new worker who started two days ago , is so frustrated she is throwing handfuls of tiles in the air . Close beside her , a young man with bloodshot eyes and two days ' growth of a beard is looking for defective tiles without any letters on them . They fight constantly for tiles , walking home from work with bruises and very little money in their pockets . <p> At the end of work today , the quitting bell rings , and we line up . I notice the M woman still on her hands and knees , her face streaked red from crying . When I walk over to her , she holds up a handful of tiles , all W 's . " They look the same , Katie , " she tells me , almost pleading . " I mean , if you did n't look too closely , do n't you think they kind of look alike ? " She 's spent the entire day picking up the wrong letter , and once the W man understands what has happened , he runs over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he reaches her , she tosses the tiles across the room , mixing in with the unsorted piles , and the W man falls down beside her , yelling . As I walk out of the factory , I punch my timecard , drop off and authorize my collected tiles for today , and begin counting the steps home . <p> Seven thousand three hundred and eighty-three steps back home . <p> I live in a small apartment above a confection stop . The shop is run by Greta , an older woman with hair the color of salt and pepper blended together and kind features that seem as if she has never known anger . She lives with her daughter in a small apartment in the back of the shop and charges my brother and me one hundred dollars a month for the apartment above them . We have been here for three weeks now , slowly getting used to the new surroundings , of waking every morning to the smell of cinnamon and sugar rising from the floor like steam . I walk into the shop and purchase a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lollipop for a nickel for my brother . As I pay , Greta 's nineteen-year-old daughter , Joan , emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray of chocolate turtles with her good arm to place in the display case . Her other arm , withered and bent at an awkward angle , is pulled close to her body , as if she is cradling a small baby animal . Greta told me that Joan was born with it , that she came into this world weighed down with useless things . <p> Joan 's hair is shiny black and falls past her shoulders , unlike her mother , who keeps her hair pinned up . Her eyes gleam brown like caramel , and when she catches my gaze , her smile creeps across her face in small increments , as if her happiness starts in one place and slowly moves out in all directions . She holds up one of the chocolate turtles and lets me take a bite . Pecans , chocolate , and caramel mix together in my mouth , and I taste Joan 's fingerprints on my tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and I want to stand there for hours and watch her , but the shop is beginning to fill with rush-hour customers . They come in every day for a sugar fix after a long shift at one of the factories that surround the shop on all sides , like a deep , dark forest enveloping a tiny gingerbread house . I walk up the steps to the apartment , fifteen steps , and press my ear against the door , listening for movement , for my brother 's presence . I can hear him in there , swimming in the living room . <p> Caleb is in the middle of the living room , lying face-down on a long , narrow piece of wood suspended by two chairs , practicing his strokes . He is swinging his arms over his head , his fingers pulled tightly together to cut down on wind resistance . His body is pale , almost translucent , from lack of sun , and his muscles cling tight to his body , rippling like waves as he moves . When he notices me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ motion , and smiles . I am tired , my fingertips are sore , and I flop down on the couch . Caleb rolls off the board and crawls on hands and knees over to me , resting his forehead against mine . <p> Caleb is sixteen . He goes to the public school eight blocks away and is the star swimmer on the school team . After school , he practices at the YMCA with the rest of the team until four , and when I return from work an hour and a half later , the apartment is already filled with the smell of chlorine , of chemicals . He has shaved his head , his eyebrows even , to swim faster at his next meet . When he stares at me with his pale blue eyes , stained red from the chlorine , he looks like a seal , like a newborn puppy . <p> " Guess how many steps it took to get home today , " I ask him . We play this game every day . <p> " I do n't know . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> " Two . " <p> " More . " <p> " A million . " <p> " Less . " <p> " A thousand . " <p> " More . " <p> " A hundred thousand . " <p> " Less . " <p> " Five thousand . " <p> " More . " <p> " Ten thousand . " <p> " Less . " <p> " Seven thousand . " <p> " More . " <p> " Eight thousand . " <p> " Less . " <p> " Seven thousand three hundred and eighty . . . four . " <p> " Almost . . . seven thousand three hundred and eighty-three . " <p> " Did you count the step into the shop from outside ? " <p> " No . " <p> " Well . There you go . " <p> Caleb lies face-down on the carpet beside the couch . He keeps his head turned to one side and his arms at his sides with the palms up . I lie on my back with one arm hanging off the couch , tracing circles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exposure to the chemically treated water . With his arms positioned the way they are , I can see the scars on his wrists , the deep wounds covered over with new skin . Caleb has tried to kill himself twice in the last three years , since our parents died . The last time , he slit his wrists with a Swiss Army knife during swim practice and dove in the pool to swim a 100-meter freestyle , trailing a cloud of blood behind him . He spent three weeks in the hospital , and the doctors say that he seems fine now , but they said that the last time . He is not an unhappy person , just unstable , and that 's more unsettling . At work , while searching for Q 's , I will feel something move quick and light up my spine and think of Caleb . I spend as much time as possible watching him , keeping an eye on him , but the fact is that if he wants to do it again , he will . It 's impossible to quell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up nights . <p> Three years ago , my parents blew up . I do n't know how else to say it . One evening , riding the subway home from an evening out , my parents sat in an empty subway car and spontaneously combusted . A subway guard found them later that night , the upper half of their bodies charred beyond recognition . It was the first recorded double Spontaneous Human Combustion in history , which we unfortunately heard several times over the following weeks . Their death was featured in a special hour-long episode of Luminous Mysteries of the Unexplained , but I did n't watch . It 's horrible when you lose both of your parents , even worse when you ca n't explain it , ca n't understand exactly what it means . When people ask now , I usually say they died in a fire or a gas explosion . They are gone , and I can accept that , or at least I 'm trying to . What I ca n't get around , another thing that keeps me up nights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> My parents exploded , returned to dust , and there is no way to explain it . At least once a day , the thought occurs to me that I , too , could one day blow up . I think that perhaps spontaneous combustion is hereditary , that it is passed down from generation to generation and lies waiting to make itself known . Perhaps it 's like Huntington 's chorea , a fifty-fifty chance , and you have to wait until you get older to find out . At work , I 'll be sorting tiles and feel flush , red-cheeked , and my heart will stop , waiting to explode . Hot flashes give me nervous tremors for hours afterwards . Each change in temperature , each flash , is another possible warning sign that I will blow up . So , I ca n't sleep . I sit in bed for hours , lying perfectly still and waiting for a sound , like a pop , like an electrical spark , or a fizz . Or , I sit out on the fire escape and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploding like a firework , spreading myself across the sky in multiple colors . <p> I am sitting on the fire escape tonight , drinking a glass of milk and eating a chocolate drop . The sky is clogged , too much smoke , and I watch the moonlight make shadows through the clouds . I look at the alley behind the shop and try to figure out how many steps it would take to walk through it , end to end . I am pacing the steps in my head when I hear Joan below me , climbing up the ladder . She moves quickly , using her good arm to steady herself as she moves . This has been happening for two weeks now , these night meetings . She is even more beautiful at night , when her hair is lost in the night 's darkness , mixes with it , and her face seems to be hovering in front of me . We sit on the fire escape , legs hanging over the edge , and she rests her head on my shoulder . She smells of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you set on fire , cherries flambe . I tell her about work , about how many steps it took to get home . While she listens , she plucks a strand of hair from her head and chews on it , as if it were a blade of grass . <p> She does this often , a habit of sorts , and this time I ask her about it , twirl her hair around one of my fingers . She smiles , takes another piece of her hair , and offers it to me . I take it , hold it up to the moonlight , and then place it gently on my tongue . It is sweet , like a piece of string coated with rock candy . She tells me it is from working in the candy shop all day . Clouds of sugar hover in the air and settle in her hair . I chew the flavor from the strand and place the hair in my pocket . <p> I ask her if she likes spending so much time at the shop . She has been working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skipping school altogether . She tells me that she actually likes it , that when her mother goes , she will take over the shop . " It 's one thing I know how to do , " she tells me . " It 's imprinted , I guess . " I notice the time and realize that I must get to bed , even if I just lie awake until I go to work . loan kisses me , quick , her tongue flicking across my front teeth , and she turns to climb back down . I watch her move down the ladder , down the twenty-four rungs , and creep back into her room . My face is hot , warm . Even after she is gone , I wait out on the fire escape for it to pass , trying not to explode . <p> To unlock the potential power of the letter Q , one must learn quickly that there are other words to spell than the standard qu structure like quartet or quality or queen . Qat , qaid , qoph , and faqir will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them . These are the things that pop into my head while I work . It takes everything I have to make Q important , to think of it as something more than the seventeenth letter of the alphabet . And I have to do it . I have to think that there is some reason that I am searching so hard for this letter to the point that my fingers ache at night with phantom pains , the outline of a Q pressing into my fingertips . <p> I steal a letter today at work . Q after Q after Q , and my fingertips finally find something else . I Braille a new letter , holding up a J in between my thumb and forefinger . Its line is smooth , an elegant curve at the bottom that my fingertip traces like a car going around a bend . I want it . I want to give it to loan , to follow it up with an O and an A and an N until I can lay her name out in front of her . I look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loose over her eyes , and I quickly shove the tile into my bag . A lot of workers steal letters . Some people , over a period of time , take enough letters so that they can play the game at home , on a piece of cardboard lined off with a ruler . At the end of work , I dip my hands into my bag and find the I again . As I move to the counter to turn in my tiles , I slip the J under my tongue , hold it there even after I walk out onto the sidewalk . I keep it there as I count the number of steps off in my head , thinking of Joan and hiding her under my mouth . <p> I am not sure how my parents felt about each other . I think they loved each other . It seems like a reasonable answer . Still , they did n't like each other very much at all sometimes . I guess they were like any couple in that they loved each other and did n't love each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say . <p> At night , when I am trying not to explode , when I am trying not to spend the entire night listening for the sound of my brother breathing , so many images of my parents in that subway car pop into my head . It 's different every time . <p> Here 's one way that I see it : They are coming home from a night out , a meal at some diner , a movie , a milkshake afterwards , and then they are side by side in an empty subway car . My father says something rude , something he knows he should n't mention , but decides to do so , anyway . My mother mutters something back to him , bastard , son of a bitch , something like that . My father shifts slightly in his seat , turning away from her , trying very hard not to say something he is very sure that he will regret later . They are both angry , both thinking up caustic , mean things to say to each other . My father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it gets when he takes apart some appliance in our house and then realizes he has no idea how to put it back together . His head aches , his stomach burns a little , but he chalks it up to greasy diner food . My mother feels flush , attributes it to adrenaline , from thinking of different ways to maim my father . The subway grows increasingly warm , it gets harder to breathe . My parents look at each other for just a second , realize they do not love each other , do not want to get off at the same stop together , and they explode . That 's one way I see it . <p> I get back home from work , seven thousand nine hundred and fifty-four steps , and Caleb and Joan are sitting out in front of the shop . Caleb is talking excitedly , moving his hands around in front of his face and rocking back and forth . Joan listens , frowning , and when they see me , both of them spring up . Caleb grabs my arm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joan follows behind . We sit on the couch , all three squeezed together , while we pass around a bag of multicolored gumdrops . " It 's the news , Katie , " he says to me . " Watch this , " and Caleb turns up the volume of the TV . We have a small black and white TV with rabbit ears that have been adjusted so many times that they fall limp on top of the TV . We watch the screen flip over and over , listening to the news report . <p> A woman in Canton , Ohio , spontaneously combusted last night . Her neighbors found her this morning , a pile of ashes and undamaged extremities on her easy chair . The floor above her had fire damage , but a newspaper at the foot of the chair was n't even singed . The chair was only superficially burned . A paranormal expert talks to a reporter , demonstrating how a spontaneous combustion victim explodes internally , leaving the surroundings virtually unharmed . He burns a candle made of hog 's fat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burns its own fat until only ashes remain , ashes that are more fine , more powdery , than cremated remains . Caleb is now off the couch , his face inches from the tiny screen . " Just like Mom and Pop , " he says to no one . Joan asks me what Caleb means , but I can not tell her the specifics , not yet . I stand up and walk away , counting . I listen to the sound of Joan 's footsteps behind me as she follows , and I count those , too . <p> That night , Joan lies in bed with me as I tell her about exploding . I run my hands over her chest and stomach , comforted by the sameness and differences of our bodies . She is soft , warm against my fingertips , while my own body is tight , muscular , coiled tension . Joan traces the freckles that cover my body , and as her finger touches my skin , she says she can feel me vibrating . She wraps her arms tight around my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start talking . <p> I tell her that the most likely victim of Spontaneous Human Combustion is a solitary woman , that seventy-five percent of all known cases of SHC are women . I tell her that some people believe that arsonist poltergeists are to blame , that the spirits of firestarters roam the cities setting souls on fire . In Lucknow , a little town in India , the government requested disaster relief funds for an outbreak of " spirit fires . " I tell her that by manipulating internal organs , people can generate explosive bursts of electrical energy from within their stomachs . This was documented in the Blair " ring of fire " expedition to Indonesia in the early sixteenth century . I tell her that maybe people explode because they move their organs around without knowing it , that you are sitting down one day and your organs shift on accident and you blow up . I tell her all these things , but I do not tell her that I am afraid of exploding because her lips are soft against mine and I do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way that I see it : My parents are riding the subway home after a beautiful night . The moon makes my mother 's face shine , my father looks ten years younger . They find an empty subway car and kiss , pull each other close . They whisper things into each other 's ears , run their hands over their bodies until the windows in the subway are fogged with steam . They are happy ; they are in love , and in the moment of this demonstration of their love , the space between them , the friction from their bodies , ignites , and they explode wrapped up in each other 's arms . They look into each other 's eyes , and a flash blinds them , and the smoke from their ashes mingles together and rises up out of the subway car . That 's another way I see it . <p> I take an O at work today . . . actually , I take three of them . I am always finding them , they feel so much like a Q , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I took three of them . I think about making a bracelet for Joan out of the tiles , a string around her wrist so the fine wood grain of the tiles will slide up and down her arm when she touches my face . The blue light flashes , the siren wails , and when the tiles fall , I hold out my hands and feel them fall through my fingers . <p> I only find twenty-nine Q 's , and I wonder if someone is hiding them from me . Occasionally , if you rub someone the wrong way , they start hoarding your letters and hiding them in the corners of the room . One day , the S man , a thin , long-legged man who constantly chews on multiple sticks of licorice gum so that it looks like he has no teeth , pushed over the man who collects R 's . For an entire week after that , the S man was running around the room , searching for S 's and shaking his nearly empty bag of tiles . Before work ends , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had a slow day , that the Q 's just did n't fall my way . When the quitting bell rings , I shove the three O 's into my mouth . As we walk to the counter , I catch a glimpse of myself in the reflection of a window , my mouth crooked and poking out at odd angles . I feel my face flush , a stirring in my stomach , and my feet will not move . I spit two of the O 's into my bag , decide to say that I must have picked them up by accident , and keep the other tile tight under my tongue . I say nothing to the worker at the counter , manage only a half smile , and begin counting my way home . <p> When I get back to the apartment , seven thousand three hundred and twelve steps , Joan is waiting outside on the curb . The shop is closed , the lights dim , and when I see Joan 's face , I know I will not like what I hear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is at the hospital , where Greta is already talking to the doctors . I stumble , lean up against Joan , and she helps me walk over to the hospital . I hold on to her bad arm , both of my hands squeezing tight . My feet shuffle slowly , and it is hard to count the steps , to know where one ends and the other begins . <p> In the hospital room , Caleb sits upright , his lungs pushing softly against his chest . He is pale , more pale than usual , a cloudy , splotchy sheet of chalk rather than the soothing translucence he usually gives off . Greta has gone back to the store , but Joan sits outside in the waiting room , chewing strands of her hair and asking nurses about Caleb when they walk by . I do not know if it was because of the report on the news last night , if there is any explanation , but Caleb has tried again . <p> Today at swim practice , when he lined up for laps , he toed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wrists . He dove into the pool with his teammates , and while they thrashed and kicked waves of water into the air , Caleb , in the fourth lane , quietly sank to the bottom , pulled his knees in close to his body , and sat on the floor of the pool . It took some time-with the commotion and splashing-for Caleb 's coach to notice his body underwater . It was not long , a few minutes at the most . Doctors say he is fine , has hopefully not incurred any irreversible damage , but he is still in the hospital bed . I can smell the chlorine on his body , sterile and strong like bodies after they have been embalmed , slightly plastic . <p> I run my fingers over the smooth streaks of where his eyebrows should be , and he closes his eyes . The doctors say he will not be allowed to come home afterwards , that there will be tests and evaluations . His behavior is unstable , and they will attempt to make it less so . I try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crooked smile , turned up too much at the corners . I think that perhaps this is what he wants , these small moments after he 's tried , when the world around him is fuzzy and warm and slow . <p> I do not know what to say to him , and so I hold his hand to my face , breathe in his smell . He tells me before I leave that he 's sorry for making me worry , that he is fine , and will be fine . " I guess I just keep doing stupid things , " he says softly to me . " It 's just something I do . " Even though I know this , can not quite accept it , I know that I will wait for him to come home , will smile when he does . And we will wait all over again because that 's the way it works . <p> I wake up in my own room later that night . I do not remember the walk back from the hospital , how many steps it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeared in my room . Joan lies beside me , pressing her hand against my forehead . My head is on fire , fevered , and Joan 's hand feels cool against my face . I sit up , lean back against the headboard of the bed , and she takes her hand away . It is dark outside ; not even the faint glow of moonlight reaches the window of my room . There is nothing here except the two of us , and the things inside of me . It is too hard to hold back , and so I tell Joan about my parents , about exploding . <p> I tell her that I am going to blow up one day , that I will be walking down the street , caught in mid-count , and I will burn a circle into the sidewalk . My head hurts . I am dizzy . I do not want to think about numbers of steps or letters or smells of sugar and chlorine or anything . I am going to explode . Pieces of me will burst like a balloon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but what is inside , the air , will rush out and spread apart . Joan only pulls me closer , holds me so that her bad arm lies between us , hovers in the space between our bodies , fills up distance . I hide my face in her hair , hold on to her , and wait for another day to start . <p> When the morning comes , Joan is still here with me . The idea of this , the nearness of her , makes me forget for a little while that I am not at work , which is where I am supposed to be . I have never missed a day of work . It is not something that I had ever considered the possibility of . I just went . And now I am not at work , and I am in bed with Joan , and it does not seem so unthinkable . <p> The sunlight finally wakes Joan also , and she rolls onto her side and smiles , still half-asleep . There is either nothing or everything to say , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cinnamon rising from the confection shop downstairs , a warm current of air that surrounds us . It reminds me that Joan should also be at work , baking with her mother . " Should n't you be down there ? " I ask her . " You 're late for work . " She moves on top of me , pins me to the bed . " I could ask you the same thing , " she says . I tell her that I do n't always have to be at the factory , that it is not my whole life . When I say it , I realize that it 's true . I do n't have to be there . Joan tells me that she does n't always have to be downstairs , either . " I can be other places , too , " she says . " I can be upstairs if I like . I can be upstairs all day if I care to . " We laugh and watch the sun rise higher and higher though the window . <p> Later in the afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the day , we dress and head down the stairs , where Greta has saved us a few cinnamon rolls . We eat them , and then Joan ties on an apron and walks behind the counter . We will see each other again tonight , this we understand without having to say . I go outside and count the steps it takes me to walk somewhere that is not the factory , someplace different . <p> It takes five thousand and forty-three steps to walk to the florist , where I purchase a dozen tulips , bright orange . It takes me another three thousand and eighty-eight steps to reach the foot of my parents ' graves . I place six of the flowers on either side of the single large tombstone . It is a simple stone , names and dates only . I close my eyes as I run my fingertips over the letters of their names etched into the marble , how perfect each shape feels . I try to think back to what it was like before they were gone , the life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us in our old house , farther away from the factories and smoke , and pretend we are all there now . We are all at the dinner table , eating , talking , and laughing . But there is nothing else . The memory can not sustain itself , and it disappears . It gets harder and harder each time to remember my life as anything but the factory , my brother and me alone . It upsets me sometimes , to think that my brother and I have had so little happiness since they died . <p> I want to be angry with my parents , and sometimes I am , but it never lasts . They had no idea what would happen , the strange ways our lives would separate . And it does no good to think that it could have been better or worse or just the same as it is now . There are new things , good things that I can see for the first time in a while . It makes me smile to finally understand this , that we have only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for them , the tiny , almost imperceptible feeling on our fingertips . <p> Here is another way I see it . It is the way I 'd like to think it happened , the way that makes sense . My parents , two people who love each other most of the time , ride home on the subway after a fine meal and an average movie . They find an empty subway car and talk , chat back and forth , laugh . They hold hands , fill up the space between them . The subway car gets warmer , the windows fog . My father looks at my mother , red-faced and breathing in rapid bursts . It reminds him of when she had the children , of childbirth . There is a flash , a burst of heat , and my mother looks at my father one last time . My father simply holds on to her hand , pulls himself a little closer to her , to the flash of heat , and covers his body over hers . They explode , burn away , and smolder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that . <p> I quit today . <p> At the Scrabble factory , a little after two o'clock , I bury my hands in letters and pull up overflowing handfuls , stuffing them into my shoulder bag until tiles leak out from the top and tumble to the floor . I leave the sorting room , tell the supervisor I am going on a bathroom break . He does n't even look up , could care less about the bag of tiles . <p> I walk slowly down the corridor until he is out of sight , and then I pick up speed , faster and faster until the counter is only a blur , the attendant 's orders to stop just a wave of sound that crashes too late . And I am out the door , down the steps , running back to the candy shop , to Joan , though I do not know it yet . Right now , I am just running , one foot in front of the other , and it feels like I will never stop , will never slow down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head can not keep up with my feet . <p>
