Shall I have the brains ? Would that be better copy for you ? " It would . So Nigella Lawson  --  former newspaperwoman , member of PEOPLE 'S 50 Most Beautiful People list and reigning cookbook queen  --  has the calf 's brains . She also has the octopus salami , the gnocchi with zucchini flowers , spaghetti with sardines , Tuscan steak , crispy duck and other gourmet victuals  --  many of which originally resided on my plate . <P> Lawson is in New York City to promote her latest cookbook , Forever Summer . We 've decided to go on an eating date to three Manhattan restaurants of her choice  --  one each for appetizers , entrees and desserts . " Eating is more fun than cooking , " she says , explaining why we wo n't be sampling any of her food . " Anyway , I do n't cook professionally . I cook like someone who likes to eat . That 's my niche . " Lawson eschews things like measurements and specific ingredients ( Forever Summer 's grilled sea bass recipe begins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for this . Similarly , you do n't need to use sea bass " ) in favor of an endorphin-fueled dive into food prep . Her cooking show , Nigella Bites , is often called gastro porn in her native England , while in the U.S. its host is frequently referred to as the anti-Martha . Lawson does justice to both categorizations by announcing , " I 've worn an elastic waist this evening ! Let 's go . " <P> Our first stop is Beppe , a Tuscan restaurant whose chef Lawson knows . Before we reach our table , she 's ordered a bottle of prosecco and French fries with rosemary and oregano . " I love fat , " she says . While we wait for our half a dozen appetizers , Lawson launches into her professional history . She tells a good tale , deftly mixing the grandiose and ironic ( a recipe in her first book begins , " I first had salsa verde when I was a chambermaid in Florence ... " ) with a healthy sprinkling of famous names . Her father Nigel was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thatcher . After graduating from Oxford , Nigella followed her father into journalism at the Sunday Times of London . Soon she veered into her mother 's territory ( Vanessa Lawson was an heiress to a chain of tea shops ) and started writing about food . <P> " I really was a journalist before I became this monster , " she says , " and sometimes I go on these chat shows and I 'd just so much rather talk about al-Qaeda than how to cook a proper lamb . " While she says she occasionally feels like a " blow-up doll , " Lawson was never happier to have her food universe than when her husband John Diamond spent four years suffering from throat cancer . ( He died in 2001 ; Lawson 's current boyfriend is advertising mogul Charles Saatchi . ) This explains , at least in part , her food hedonism . " People should stop demonizing fat , " she says through bites of French fry . " Seeing food as something like medicine is a horrible idea . Life 's too short . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while chomping on duck , branzino and brains . " I 'm like a Chinese Jew , " she says . " I love brains and sweetbreads and all that stuff . " At the next table , fellow Brit Tim Curry spots Lawson and offers a seated bow . " I have them all ! " he screams , presumably about her books . But it 's far too loud to hear anything . Lawson suggests we get dessert .
