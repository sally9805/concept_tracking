<p> He graduated at the top of his class at Harvard and now studies medicine at UC-San Francisco . His debut novel , " The Piano Tuner " ( Knopf , $24 )  --  penned in the corner of the basement library between rotations  --  hit best-seller lists around the nation . Critics praise him as " sensational " and " brilliant , " and his medical professors line up at readings to get his autograph . <p> Oh , and he 's 26 . <p> Daniel Mason 's resume would inspire hatred and envy if it did n't belong to Daniel Mason . Marketing this wunderkind has been a bit precarious  --  how do you persuade readers and critics he 's not some annoying prima donna ? <p> " When I talk to people about him , I try not to preface everything by saying his age , " said his agent , Christy Fletcher . " I almost feel immediately defensive  --  that this is n't some urban angst novel , and he is n't at all precocious . He 's just a really nice kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice kid sat at a picnic table at Stanford 's Rodin Sculpture Garden  --  near his family 's Palo Alto home  --  and blushed a bit at the mention of his debut novel 's phenomenal success . <p> " I 'm pretty shocked , pretty shaken up , " said Mason , who sometimes writes in the solitude of the sculpture garden . " The biggest surprise for me is that it 's a book . The rest is wonderful , but I ca n't get over that it 's on the shelf . . . when I go into a bookstore , I ca n't help but think that they put it out just because I 'm walking in . " When he sees his image in a newspaper or magazine , he thinks someone 's playing a joke on him and has cut-and-pasted his picture onto the page . When his publicist asked him to send a portrait to be used on the book jacket , he initially mailed a shadowy snapshot in which his face was obscured . He did n't want patients who came across the book @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than a dedicated doctor . <p> He had to take the better part of this academic year off from medical school to promote his book at readings around the United States , Asia , Australia and New Zealand . He 'll tour Europe beginning in January and is spending most of his time before then in Brazil writing his second novel , the title and plot of which he wo n't reveal . There 's talk of making " The Piano Tuner " into a movie , and the novel is being translated into more than 20 languages . ( " I think we actually sold Serbian rights ! " Fletcher squealed . ) <p> Still , Mason insists he 'll return to school in the spring and that practicing medicine is his first priority . When he says , " It feels good to have a job that feels so useful , " he 's referring to medicine , not writing . <p> It 's hard to choose which is the more unlikely story : that of Edgar Drake , the piano tuner Mason dreamed up who travels to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general , or Mason himself , the serious doctor-to-be who struggles to determine just where he got the writer 's bug . <p> As a kid growing up in Palo Alto with his father , a radiation professor at Stanford , his mother , an artist , and his younger sister , Mason occasionally wrote 50-word stories about " some dog 's adventures . " Mason longed to be an adventurer himself , waffling between becoming an astronaut or an archaeologist . <p> He became more interested in science at Palo Alto High School and majored in biology at Harvard . He took one creative writing class and wrote about a North African migrant worker toiling in Southern Spain . <p> Upon graduating from Harvard in 1998 , he took a year off to study malaria on the Thailand-Burma border , and returned the following summer after his first year of medical school . He became fascinated with just about everything around him . <p> " Living in a place is like doing research  --  observing the people , their culture , what the temples are like , what they eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that I was going to forget my entire time there so I just started writing things down . " <p> He dedicated the book to his grandmother , Halina , a painter with an incredible eye for detail . He credits her with teaching him how to simply observe . <p> " She would say , ' Is n't this wonderful  --  the pattern of the slats on the bench ? ' Or , ' the shade of the branches on the ground ? ' " he said . " That made me look around a lot . " <p> While in Thailand , he heard odd stories about Americans who had brought large objects  --  including a bathtub  --  with them to the jungles there . He began thinking about other amusing objects people could bring with them . That led him to imagine a piano dragged by an elephant to a Burmese jungle with nobody around to tune it . <p> Once some semblance of a plot took shape in his head , an incredible amount of research began  --  spanning everything from Victorian London to the near-mythical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warfare . Mason studied and wrote in secret at first , not telling even his closest friends at medical school about his venture . <p> " I doubted I 'd ever finish it in the first place , " he said . " I just kept it a secret . " <p> Once the novel seemed somewhat feasible , he began divulging his news , first telling his parents and sister and then his UCSF classmate , Jafi Lipson . <p> " He said he was writing a story , " she said . " I did n't really know what he was referring to . I thought , ' Oh , that 's kind of a quaint distraction . Good for you ! ' He 's the king of understatement . " <p> But as Mason became more immersed in writing , the pursuit seemed all the more real . He 'd bring up piano tuners over lunch , peruse books about Burma between classes and write pieces of his novel during study sessions . <p> " You can only memorize the bones of the hand for eight hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mad if you spend all day memorizing for school , and you 'll go mad if you creatively write all day . " <p> Still , nobody around him can quite figure how he found the time to research and write the novel , perform well in his classes , hang out with the roommates who shared his Inner Sunset apartment , jog to Ocean Beach regularly  --  and sleep . <p> " I think some people were skeptical , but I was always just in awe , " Lipson said . " He 's so low-key and unassuming , but he 's exploding with potential and you ca n't help but see that . " <p> It came about in a rather odd way , though . Mason became adept at research and writing , but had no clue about the publishing world and how to turn his words into a book that people could buy . <p> His father recalled once meeting Donald Lamm , a publisher , at Lamm 's son 's wedding . Lamm , now a semi-retired literary agent living in Santa Fe , remembers receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dreaded words , " My son has written a novel . " <p> Lamm grudgingly agreed to read the book  --  then titled the bulkier " Salween River Fugue "  --  but was even more hesitant upon reading the resume that came in the mail with the manuscript . <p> " If you 're looking for a novelist , you do n't want someone who 's first in his class at Harvard , " Lamm said . " I want someone who 's at the bottom , who 's suffering . Academic brilliance does n't necessarily coincide with great novels . " <p> But upon reading the first 20 pages , Lamm deemed Mason a " natural writer " with " perfect pitch . " And from there , the dominoes of success began to fall rapidly . Lamm phoned Fletcher , a literary agent with Carlisle &; Company , with whom Lamm has a " I find them , you sell them " relationship . <p> She , too , was immediately impressed . " I was completely entranced by the book , and I was in awe  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met with Mason in New York soon thereafter . " He 's so nice and gracious . For him , it 's not about the business of the books . It 's about the writing , and it 's about the ideas . <p> " It 's exciting when you get something that 's amazing and you 're champing at the bit to send out . It makes you want to get out of bed in the morning and go to work . " <p> But timing proved a problem when the publishing industry ground to a near halt after Sept. 11 . Nobody in New York knew the fate of the world , much less some novel penned by a student out in San Francisco . Fletcher held off on sending out the manuscript for a few weeks . <p> With sadness and a bit of disinterest , Robin Dresser , an editor with Knopf , grudgingly began reading the manuscript one evening . <p> " I opened it with that sense that nothing was going to take me out of the world , " she said . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds of final memory , the image that will become Burma is the sun and the woman 's parasol )  --  I was captivated . You could tell right away it was going to be a ripping good story and quite literary . It kept me up all night . " <p> She had accidentally left the cover letter at the office and read it the next morning . Gulp  --  this was written by someone who at the time was 24 ? And a medical student ? She said her emotions waffled . At first , she thought " God , who is this ? I 'm so jealous ! " But then , she added , " You do n't usually find people this talented in the universe , but sometimes you 're really lucky . " <p> Dresser said with a laugh that she had never collaborated over the phone with an author at 6 a.m. on his way to a gynecological rotation . <p> Dresser , 42 , and Mason recently traveled together around the country on a book tour . <p> " I would frequently forget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he would walk a lot faster than me with his luggage , " she said . <p> News of Mason 's success swept the medical school campus , with Lipson sending professors and fellow students Mason 's glowing review by the New York Times ' notoriously hard-to-impress critic , Michiko Kakutani . She wrote , " It is a novel that immerses the reader in a distant world with startling immediacy and ardor , a novel that testifies to its young author 's impressive gifts of imaginative sympathy and narrative aplomb . " <p> Mason has tried to keep the hum of chatter about " The Piano Tuner " to a minimum . In an eight-week course before he took his leave from school , professor Lawrence Tierney asked the students to tell a bit about themselves . Mason never mentioned his writing . <p> Tierney added that most students call him " L.T. , " but Mason refuses . <p> " He just wo n't do it , " Tierney said . " He always calls me Dr. Tierney . He has that sort of respect for others . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hefty amount of respect for Mason and his novel . He attended a reading at A Clean , Well-Lighted Place for Books to ask his student questions about the plot . <p> " The thing that literally had me in goose flesh was the two or three pages where he described Drake tuning the piano , " Tierney said . " I 'm sitting on the edge of my chair at 3 a.m. saying , ' God , is the piano going to play well ? ' " <p> With all the publicity swirling around " The Piano Tuner " and another book already in the works , Mason knows juggling both his budding careers will be difficult . Still , he 's determined to finish medical school and go on to specialize in internal medicine . He 's also interested in psychiatry and infectious diseases . <p> Tierney said he envisions Mason following in the steps of William Carlos Williams , one of the few people in history who have earned phenomenal success in both the medical and writing worlds . <p> " I would love to see Daniel end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physician , but who also manages to write great books along the way , " Tierney said . " It would secure him a place in history on both sides . " <p> Asked whether he would someday rather win a Nobel Prize in medicine or a Pulitzer Prize for his novels , Mason looked at the ground with a little laugh . <p> " I definitely want to be practicing medicine and writing at the same time , " he said . " I think I 'd be happy just to be able to do both . " E-mail Heather Knight at hknight@sfchronicle.com.
