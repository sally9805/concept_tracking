<p> Last April , Jan Strickland knew his daughter had been killed . <p> Just knew it . <p> She had called her parents ' Northglenn home and told them where her Army helicopter battalion was deployed in Iraq . A day later , Jan and his wife , Suzanne , turned on the TV to find a Black Hawk down in the same area . All aboard died . <p> But only after a sleepless 18 hours could the Stricklands exhale : Lt. Col. Laura Richardson - their firstborn , commander of a battalion , mother to their granddaughter - was not among the casualties . <p> ' It was the worst thing I ever went through , ' Jan says now , recalling the uncertainty . ' It was horrible . ' <p> And their waiting had just begun . <p> On the eve of the war in Iraq , Jan and Suzanne emotionally prepared for four overseas deployments : two daughters , a son and a son-in-law had all shipped out on Army orders . <p> Now , after months of anxious e-mails , countless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welcomed them all home - thankful for their safe return but mindful that more overseas tours loom . <p> ' The first few months were very hard , ' says Suzanne . ' We were uncertain about what they were facing , the chemical weapons and so on . After they got settled in where they were , I relaxed a little bit . One or the other would e-mail me almost every day . ' <p> Laura , at 40 the oldest of the siblings , served for about a year as a battalion commander with the 101st Airborne , primarily from a base near Mosul . <p> Her husband , 43-year-old Lt. Col. Jim Richardson , commanded an Apache helicopter battalion with the 101st for about five months before a change of command moved him back to Washington , D.C. Earlier , he had served a combat tour in Afghanistan . <p> Janis Follwell , a 33-year-old family practice physician with the 21st Combat Support Hospital , also spent about a year in Iraq as an Army captain supporting the 4th Infantry Division in Balad , about 50 miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , served as an Army lawyer for the 11th Air Defense Artillery Brigade , stationed at a base in Kuwait . <p> All three Strickland kids grew up in a home where rigorous athletic training - still evident from myriad motivational slogans on the walls - churned out a family of athletic stars in track or swimming or both . Three of four siblings joined the military . The fourth , Elaine , saw that career path derailed by asthma and became a nurse . <p> ' It was difficult , ' Jan says of the past year 's watching and waiting , ' but I always believed my children were combat-ready because of their childhood . I knew they were physically fit and very tough mentally . ' <p> During the deployments to the Iraqi theater , the parents tried to be tough , too . Jan , a doctor , poured himself into his family practice . Suzanne stayed glued to the TV screen or her computer , printing out every e-mail and trying hard to keep family apprised of the latest news . <p> ' When I talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . ' The key was not to call attention to it . ' <p> So she kept busy assembling packages loaded with essentials : baby wipes ( for washing amid scarce water supplies ) , toilet paper and snacks . <p> ' I tried to send one box a week to all four of them , ' Suzanne says . ' It kept me going to and from the post office . ' <p> But even more critical duty dominated the home front . Jan and Suzanne took care of Jim and Laura 's daughter , 15-year-old Lauren , while her parents served . They enrolled her at Northglenn High School , where the family name still looms large . <p> Jan Strickland volunteers as team doctor for athletic events . Many of Darwin 's teachers still work there and Laura herself remains a fixture - in a historical sense . Her picture still hangs in tribute to her status as an All-America swimmer . <p> ' We 've known people ( at Northglenn High ) for years and years , ' says Laura , now reunited with her daughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she 'd be well taken care of . ' <p> Lauren played basketball at Northglenn , which helped distract her from the anxiety of having both parents in the midst of war . But there was no escaping the well-intentioned concern of classmates who kept up with developments on the battlefield . <p> ' People at school would say they heard where a Black Hawk had been shot down and ask , ' Was that your mother ? " Suzanne recalls . ' She was reminded of that all the time , and it was hard on her . ' <p> The wait for battlefield details proved hard on everyone . <p> Janis , deployed a six-hour convoy ride away from Laura , also would grow anxious when she heard of helicopter casualties . <p> ' Every time Black Hawks would crash , I 'd try to call or e-mail her , ' says Janis . ' Sometimes I 'd get through and sometimes I would n't . It would be an hour or two before I 'd realize it was n't her . That was a very trying time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostilities as the hospital took mortar rounds ' almost every day ' for three months - starting on the Fourth of July . She was among several doctors awarded the Bronze Star for meritorious service after providing medical care under fire . <p> Darwin spent five months in Kuwait performing various legal and administrative tasks before being redeployed to a base in Hawaii . <p> ' There were a few moments where we were in harm 's way and , had our Patriot missiles not intercepted incoming rounds , I do believe we would have suffered some harm , ' Darwin says . ' But it 's awful hard to sit back now and say that we were in as much danger as my two sisters . ' <p> In an odd twist of war , the siblings managed to get together more often during their overseas tours than they had recently while living stateside . The sporadic visits started as they arrived at the staging area in Kuwait . <p> While Laura and Janis endured the daily hardships of a tent city , their little brother enjoyed the relative comforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toiletries purchased at the local base exchange . He visited their camps bearing gifts of shampoo and snacks . <p> ' I felt like I was taking care of my sisters , ' Darwin laughs . ' For the first time . ' <p> Later in the campaign , Janis took military helicopter shuttles to see Laura at her airfield in the north . And once , when Laura flew a mission south , she had about an hour to visit Janis at her hospital . <p> ' At home , you get so busy with your own job and family , it 's hard to break away , ' says Janis , now stationed back at Fort Leonard Wood in Missouri . ' Since we were all in Iraq , we were able to see each other . It really was a comfort knowing I had family there , someone I could talk to about my experiences . ' <p> She also drew on their long sibling rivalry for strength to endure the rigors of life in a war zone . <p> ' Being able to see family and knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they could do it , so could I , ' Janis says . ' We were always somewhat competitive against one another , so that kept my spirits up . ' <p> For Laura , the knowledge that other family members worked nearby meant a heightened sense of responsibility . Among the Strickland kids , she has always been the undisputed leader . <p> ' They 're looking to me as the older sister , ' she says . ' I think that 's more of a pressure . It 's a comfort for them , maybe . But there 's more of a worry about them for me . ' <p> Darwin , who got battlefield information sometimes hours before it made the TV news , tried to ease his parents ' worries at home by relaying pertinent information about his sisters . <p> ' There was not a day that went by that I was not trying to find out how they were , or what they were doing , if they were OK , ' he adds . <p> Laura and Jim have been scheduled for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Middle East seems likely , Laura says . Janis and Darwin figure the same holds for them . <p> All of which could mean more difficult months ahead for parents Jan and Suzanne Strickland . <p> ' The second time , ' figures Jan , ' we 'll understand how to cope with the anxiety much better than the first time , when we were worried constantly . ' <p> Suzanne is n't so sure . <p> " I do n't know , " she says . " Things are getting worse . "
