Newport Beach is boaters ' heaven , Southern California-style . Roughly midway between Los Angeles and San Diego , this small Pacific Coast city boasts five miles of sandy ocean beaches , a handsome , protected harbor that is home to some 10,000 boats , an amusement area called the Fun Zone ( a name that could apply to the city itself ) and lots of friendly people with saltwater in their veins . Take Kevin Kearns , for example . Now in his 50s , Kearns ' relationship with the harbor began the day he was born . As he tells the story , his dad had convinced his pregnant mom that an afternoon sail on the bay would be wonderfully relaxing . Not so . Mom went into labor soon after the two set out in their motorless sailboat . Dad sailed into the dock of a nearby restaurant , where a valet parking attendant drove the couple to the local hospital . " I was born somewhere between the parking lot and the hospital , " Kearns said , confiding that he wishes he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say I was born on a boat . " Kearns , an executive at a boat building company in California , turned out to be the perfect guide during my tour of Newport Beach and its storied harbor recently . Six islands give the harbor its character  --  Balboa , Bay , Collins , Harbor , Lido and Linda  --  and five of them were built with dredging remains . Handsome homes and cute bungalows  --  some belonging to celebrities and most with boats tied to their docks  --  fringe the islands and shoreline , offering great ogling opportunities . While it 's possible to go bay-cruising in a large boat , the harbor has so many nooks and crannies that it 's best seen from something more maneuverable . Take your own dinghy or rent a small boat from one of several rental places . You 'll likely see John Wayne 's once-elegant motoryacht , a 136-foot former minesweeper named Wild Goose , moving through the channel . The Duke , who died in 1979 , had a home on the water here and was active in the community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and if you stop at the Newport Beach Nautical Museum , you 'll see photographs of Lauren Bacall and Humphrey Bogart , Errol Flynn , James Cagney , Tom Mix and others aboard boats in the harbor . One shows Cecil B. DeMille racing his powerboat . The museum , which is housed in a four-level , 190-foot riverboat , has a courtesy dock where visitors can tie up . Its eclectic collection includes photographs that document Newport Beach 's history , wonderful marine paintings , vintage sailboats and outboard engines , and an impressive display of ship models . My favorite was a square-rigger made in 1798 by a prisoner of war using leftover soup bones and his own hair for the rigging . A surfing exhibit will be there this summer . Another must-stop is Balboa Island . Its main street , Marine Avenue , has a fun mix of eateries , galleries , boutiques and ice cream shops . Walt Disney used to vacation in the area , and , one local told me , he is said to have modeled Disneyland 's Main Street USA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide ocean beach and many harborside attractions , is just a short hop across the bay . When you see the Ferris wheel , you 'll know you 've arrived at the Fun Zone , a family-friendly amusement area that dates back more than half a century . On the ocean side , check out the Wedge , a worldfamous body-surfing spot near the west jetty , and the Newport Pier , where the last dory fishing fleet in the United States brings its catch through the waves most mornings , then sells it from open-air stalls . Weekends are the best times to visit . As we cruised through the harbor , Kearns pointed to several restaurants with courtesy docks , including Villa Nova , where he was almost born , the Cannery , the site of the last active fish cannery in the area , and the Blue Water Grill , where we stopped for a bite . Looking at the photos from the 1920s , ' 30s and ' 40s that line its walls , you 're tempted to become nostalgic over the Newport Beach of 50 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plentiful and the community was a lot saltier . But as soon as you glance out the window and see the vibrant harbor , you 'll be glad Newport Beach is exactly the way it is.  --  BETSY FRAWLEY HAGGERTY Port of Call Three-and-a-half miles long by a half-mile wide in most places , Newport Harbor is the result of a collaboration between Mother Nature , who created the protected bay , and a series of dredging projects that made it navigable . Six islands give the harbor its character . Tip Sheet Where to Dock : Boat slips ring the harbor , but most are privately held , and transient dockage is scarce . The Newport Beach Harbor Department ( 949-723-1002 ) is the best bet ; slips rent for 60 cents per foot , per day . City-owned moorings are $5 a day , and marinas make slips available when there is room . Franko 's Map of Newport Harbor ( **27;1881;TOOLONG Harbor.htm ) is a handy guide . Fuel Up : Gas and diesel , plus marine supplies , are available at Island Fuel Company ( 949-673-1103 ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the area 's signature events is the annual Newport Harbor Christmas Boat Parade ( www.christmasboat parade.com ) , which draws tens of thousands of spectators over five nights as lighted boats parade through the harbor . Insider Info : Newport Beach Chamber of Commerce , www.newportbeach.com . Day Trip : Catalina Island Ask anyone in Newport Beach their favorite cruising destination , and the answer is unanimous : Catalina Island  --  even for a day trip . The fact that it is " 26 miles across the sea " ( as anyone who 's heard " Santa Catalina , " the 1950s Four Preps hit song , will remember ) is no deterrent . It 's an easy run of less than two hours for most cruising boats if the weather is good , and the island 's rough , mountainous beauty makes it worth the trip . The island is home to wild buffalo , foxes and bald eagles in the interior , and it has a thriving little city , Avalon , on the southeast coast . You 'll find most of the locals anchored or moored in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Avalon , where the action is . A patrol boat will meet you at the harbor entrance and guide you to a rental mooring . From there you can dinghy ashore or catch a ride on a local launch . Two structures stand out as Catalina icons  --  the Green Pleasure Pier , which dates back to 1909 , and the round Art Deco Catalina Casino at the harbor 's north end . Be sure to visit both . Several operators offer sightseeing tours to the interior , but a nice thing to do is simply to amble along the main street , explore the stores ( some filled with schlock , others with fine crafts ) , stop for lunch or just sit on the beach .  --  B.
