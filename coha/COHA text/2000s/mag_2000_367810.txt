Hussein Chalayan has fashioned clothing of unrippable paper that can be folded into envelopes , a dress designed like a kite that can actually fly and a coffee table of malleable wood that swirls into a skirt . What saves his fanciful designs from unraveling into mere novelty is the fact that Chalayan , 29 , an exquisite tailor , uses the show pieces to inspire his eminently more wearable clothes . " These pieces might not sell , " he says , " but they express the concept behind each collection . " The result is feminine clothes that are spare , clean and architecturally constructed to create volume without frills . <P> Rather than reference styles from past eras , Chalayan , who is Turkish Cypriot and based in London , molds each collection around a concept derived from outside the fashion world , whether it be the role of women in Islamic society ( chadors of varying lengths ) or the plight of families forced to leave their homes in times of war ( the inspiration for the table skirt ) . He is equally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panels , and fabrics adorned with computer-generated prints ) . " The only new work you can do in fashion is via technology , " he says . " It lets you create something you could n't have done in the past . " <P>  --  By Michele Orecklin
