<p> It was time , Amy Bloom said , to go to the other side of the room with the requisite couch , the box of tissues and the clock ticking down the 50-minute hour . You know , the side where the therapist sits , interpreting dreams and impassively imbibing neuroses . Or maybe not . <p> " Whenever you see shrinks on television , they 're so clearly written by patients , " Ms. Bloom said of creating the quirky new Lifetime series " State of Mind , " about therapists in a group practice in New Haven . " They 're either idealized or they 're demonized or they love their patients . All they ever think about is their patients . I really wanted to do an ensemble piece about therapists , to go back and forth between their personal lives and their professional lives . " <p> So , four years after getting a call asking if she were interested in writing for television ( " I do n't think so , " she initially replied , at a loss for ideas ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stories , is now also a television writer . She turned to what she knew , which included more than 20 years as a therapist ( she has a master 's degree in social work ) in a group psychotherapy practice in Middletown , Conn . For now , she has set therapy aside for writing . <p> Ms. Bloom , 54 , said goodbye in May to her writing students at Yale , found a small apartment in West Hollywood and added credits for creating , writing and producing " State of Mind " to her resume . <p> When her credits rolled during the show 's first Sunday on July 15 , some viewers might have recognized Ms. Bloom as the author of " Come to Me , " a National Book Award finalist , and " A Blind Man Can See How Much I Love You , " which was nominated for the National Book Critics Circle Award . Critics have called Ms. Bloom 's prose brisk but probing , unsentimental in its depictions of tangled relationships . Her latest novel and fifth book , " Away , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her family is destroyed in a Russian pogrom , is due in bookstores on Aug. 28 . <p> " You know , it took me a while to understand the meaning of a franchise , the reasons why you see lawyer , doctor , cop shows , " Ms. Bloom said . " It 's not because anyone in their right mind says , ' You know , what 's the most fascinating thing in the world ? ' It 's because you need something new that happens every week in a frame . " <p> True to her intent to make therapists entertaining , the foibles of the " State of Mind " characters are full-frontal  --  their affairs , their divorces , their fantasies during therapy sessions . The show stars Lili Taylor , an indie-film darling who played Lisa Kimmel Fisher in " Six Feet Under , " the dark HBO series about a family in the funeral business . Ms. Taylor 's character , Dr. Ann Bellowes , is an earnest family psychiatrist . In the first episode , she catches her husband , Phil , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marriage counselor . Who said therapists have all the answers ? <p> " I learned how to write television scripts the same way I have learned to do almost everything else in my entire life , which is by reading , " Ms. Bloom said . She chatted in her small office near the 32-acre Warner Brothers lot here , home to dozens of sets . She recalled poring over 10 television scripts , including samples of the hit " NYPD Blue , " to get some sense of how they are structured . Learning to write that way , she said , was akin to learning a " weird kind of haiku , " or " an extreme form of show-and-tell . " <p> After years of solitary writing , Ms. Bloom says she is having a ball writing and brainstorming with others ( she wrote three episodes and farmed others out ) , attending rehearsals and tapings , learning about camera angles and photography . In her real life , back in Connecticut , Ms. Bloom , the mother of three adult children from her first marriage ( two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in mid-September and squeeze in a book tour . <p> Greer Shephard helped lure Ms. Bloom to the West Coast , to temporarily trade her beloved narrative sentences for television 's visual shorthand . Ms. Shephard is executive producer of " State of Mind , " along with her production partner Michael M. Robin . Ms. Shephard and Mr. Robin are executive producers of " The Closer " for TNT , and their company produces " Nip/Tuck " on FX . <p> " In TV , I find character to be the essential DNA , and Amy 's characters were extraordinary : complicated , witty , with great emotional depth , " Ms. Shephard said of Ms. Bloom 's literature . " She was the perfect candidate to make the conversion from fiction to television . " <p> The show 's reviews have been mostly laudatory , but its ratings have been overshadowed by Lifetime 's new summertime hit , " Army Wives , " which follows " State of Mind . " Still , the therapists she has heard from like it , Ms. Bloom said , probably because it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ordinary mortals or eccentrics searching the diagnostic manuals for self-help . <p> Besides Dr. Bellowes , the fictional New Haven crew includes Dr. James Le Croix ( Derek Riddell ) , a child psychologist with an attic full of play-therapy materials and three ex-wives by age 35 , and Dr. Cordelia Banks ( Theresa Randle ) , an elegant , by-the-book psychologist who is having an affair with Dr. Taj Kalid ( Mido Hamada ) , the haughty , married psychiatrist who is more comfortable with psychopharmacology than with conversation . <p> After Dr. Bellowes kicks Phil out , the good-hearted Barry White ( Devon Gummersall ) is brought in to set up shop and share the rent in the Victorian mansion that serves as the group 's office . Barry , whose father was a criminal , practices law and is ribbed about his soul-singer name . <p> Fred Smedresman ( Kevin Chamberlin ) is the office manager . In his nerdy glasses and bad vintage clothing , Fred dispenses advice about etiquette and patients . <p> " Amy says that I 'm the closest character to her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said during an interview between tapings . " Amy is one of the most self-actualized people I have ever met , so smart , a Henry James scholar and all that . She 's able to pinpoint some neurosis in a single sentence . Fred can do that  --  he can diagnose someone in 20 words . " <p> All the characters represent pieces of herself , Ms. Bloom said , and are so fully imagined that she selected the entire decor of each therapy office to reflect their personalities . <p> Ms. Taylor , known for her portrayals of weird women , said she relished the chance to play someone normal . <p> " Playing a regular woman without a diagnosis is more complicated , " Ms. Taylor said . " It 's easier when you can say , ' I see what 's wrong with her . ' When I ca n't name it so easily , it 's actually harder and more interesting . <p> " I was always interested in playing a woman , professional and competent , but who has lost her way , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't find her neurotic . " <p> One recent day , Ms. Bloom visited a set in nearby Toluca Lake , where the crew was shooting a bedroom scene in the sprawling white stucco home of Taj and his wife , Meena . Taj had awakened from a nightmare . In his waking life , his teenage daughter has an eating disorder , and Meena knows about his affair with Cordelia . <p> " Would she wear eyeliner to bed ? " Yareli Arizmendi , the actress who plays Meena , asked Ms. Bloom . <p> " Absolutely , " Ms. Bloom said , explaining that the couple like to keep up appearances . <p> The castand crew were closing in on the last episode of the summer , to be broadcast on Sept. 9 . By then , Ms. Bloom will have whipped up plot lines about a pregnancy , ballroom dancing lessons , lesbian parents in a custody fight . And Ann is already off on another romance , with Cordelia 's ex-husband . <p> " Everyone will go through some interesting changes , " Ms. Bloom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interesting . What I find interesting is good people doing bad things . " ##
