As I walked back to my apartment that day , on my way home from work , I had a feeling that nothing could go wrong . You know that feeling you get when everything seems to be right with the world ? When the planets seem to be in alignment ? One of those days when you 're actually running on time , your apartment is ( relatively ) clean , and you have n't gotten into an argument with your mother/best friend/boss/therapist in at least a week ? That was exactly how I felt as I strolled home from work down Mercer Street to my apartment on 301 Prince Street . I had left my office that evening at 8:30 p.m. , which-at Gilson , Hecht and Trattner , the large Manhattan law firm where I work- is actually considered early , so I was feeling as if I had the whole night ahead of me . And I was going home to pick up my gorgeous Scottish boyfriend so that we could go out and meet friends for supper at some fabulous little downtown brasserie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so I could hardly wait . I had the perfect New York City evening planned out . Since I usually got out of work closer to 9:00 p.m. than 5:00 p.m. , I considered myself lucky to have a boyfriend who liked to eat dinner late . I once dated a math teacher who left work at 4:00 p.m. and was in bed by ten . That relationship was destined tofail . Ditto for the guy who traded foreign something or others who started his day at 3:00 a.m. and ate his dinner before I even thought about getting lunch . My boyfriend , Douglas , on the other hand , thought that people who ate dinner before 8:00 p.m. were uncivilized . I walked into the lobby of my apartment building-the poshest building in all of Soho-with a skip in my step . The Soho Triumphe , a building so fancy that , in addition to its staff of eight doormen , it boasts a twenty-four-hour concierge who can get you into any restaurant in Manhattan ( not like Douglas ever needed any such help ) . It even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said hello to the evening doorman who , despite the fact that I had moved into Douglas 's apartment a full two years ago , still could n't quite remember my name . " Um , 32G ? , he asked with a pained expression that indicated to me that he was thinking , at least , very very hard about who I was . I nodded my head yes and pulled my hair out of the bun I usually wore at work while he checked his book for deliveries . Douglas loved my hair-dark brown with natural auburn highlights that was so long it fell down my back to just below my bra strap- so I always took it down right before I got up to our apartment . The doorman handed me a mountain of dry cleaning-five custom-made Italian suits ( Douglas 's ) , five monogrammed shirts ( Douglas 's ) and one skirt ( mine ) . I checked the mail and took out four bills ( Douglas 's ) and the Barneys New York Spring Look Book ( mine ) - or maybe it was Douglas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Balancing it all in the crook of my arm , with my oversize work bag forcing my body to lean perilously to the right , I made it to the elevator just as the door was about to close . I kicked my foot out and stopped the door with my leg . Inside , I could see a tiny little man furiously pressing the " door close " button . " You could lose a limb trying to get to your apartment , " I said to the man with a laugh . Rather than being embarrassed for not holding the elevator for me , he looked annoyed that I had made it in . " Or you could just wait for the next elevator , " he replied under his breath . And they say that chivalry is dead . With my free arm , I pressed the button for thirty-two . My work bag slid down my shoulder , catching my long hair underneath the strap . I tried to jump up to release my hair , turning my head quickly to the left as I did so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I begged it not to fall , whispering " We 're almost there , " to it as if talking to a small child . The man looked at me , his expression saying , " The economy must really be bad if our co-op board let this woman into the building . " But I did n't care . The night would still be perfect . No doubt I would get back to my apartment , and Douglas would be waiting for me with open arms . Seeing me with all of my packages , he would grab them from me , throw them on the couch and kiss me passionately . In his charming Scottish accent , he would say , " Darling , I missed you so much today I could barely stand it , " or something as equally romantic and heartfelt and we would go meet our fabulous friends for a fabulous evening out . On our way to the restaurant , he would turn to me and say , " How is it that you look even more beautiful after working a full ten-hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the elevator did n't have a gorgeous Scottish boyfriend to go home to . Or , actually , maybe he did . He was wearing really , really nice shoes . But I did . I walked in the door to my apartment , starving to death ( because , let 's face it , I 'm totally uncivilized ) , and before I even had a second to put down our dry cleaning , my gorgeous Scottish boyfriend broke up with me . Normally , my life is n't this complicated . You see , I 'm a simple girl with simple hopes . Up until two weeks ago , all I really wanted in life was for my boyfriend Douglas to buy an engagement ring . And he did ! He just did n't give it to me . But I was fine . Even though the breakup was difficult , I remained very dignified . Well , not so much dignified as a screaming crying mess . But it 's not as if I embarrassed myself or anything . Unless you 'd call throwing yourself at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luckily for me , I do not . We had a very mature conversation , really , if you think about it . I sweetly said , " Please do n't go ! Please do n't leave me ! " Okay , so maybe I was screaming it at the time , but you get where I was going with that one . " I 'm sorry , Brooke , " Douglas said . " It 's not you . It 's me . You are an amazing girl . You have so much to offer . It 's just that this does n't feel right . It 's just not the time for us . " Now is n't that mature ? So , I answered him in kind . " And it is the time for you and that-that-bimbo ? What the hell is her name ? " " Beryl . " " That 's not even a naaaame ! " I bellowed . " Brooke , let 's not get hysterical , " Douglas said . Hysterical ? I was , like , so not hysterical . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try to still be friends ? , " Okay . you 're right . Friends . " See how mature I was being ? " Right then , " he said , sounding very Scottish . How I loved that accent . " I 'll be going . " This may have been the part where I lunged for the tails of his suit jacket and he then dragged me about twenty feet to the door . " No ! " I was screaming . " No , please , no ! " Okay , yes , now that I 'm telling you about this , I distinctly recall being dragged across the f loor screaming , " Do n't go ! " Oh , please . As if you never did that , too . As a last ditch effort , I cried , " You ca n't do this ! Please do n't go ! It is n't right ! " In an instant , his expression changed . I 'm getting through to him , I thought . I lightened my viselike grip on the tails of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't go . It is n't right . " I shook my head in agreement and breathed a sigh of relief . As visions of wild , passionate makeup sex f loated through my mind , he said , " After all , I own the apartment . " And with that , he opened the door . I should never have let go of the tails of his jacket . Really , I blame the breakup on Trip 's wedding . That 's when everything started to go downhill between Douglas and me . And what 's worse , everyone I know thought that I should n't have gone to the wedding in the first place . Somehow , everyone who knew me just knew that Trip 's wedding would be the end of Douglas and me . ( Except little old me , of course . ) I really hate being a foregone conclusion . When I told my mother that I was going to Trip 's wedding , she said , " Trip 's wedding ? Trip who ? , ( As if Jewish girls from Long Island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from law school Trip ? What woman , in her right mind , would want to go to that ? " Vanessa , my best friend from law school , initially RSVP 'd no to the wedding , since she assumed that I would n't want to attend . When she found out that I wanted to go , she later called Trip to tell him that her " big case " had settled and that she and her husband , Marcus , would be there-but not before asking me approximately 472 times if I " wanted to talk about it ? " And when I told the partner I worked for at my firm that I would be out of town for a four-day weekend to take my boyfriend to L.A. to go to Trip 's wedding , even he asked me , " Why the hell would you want to do that ? " I could have sworn that I even saw my therapist look at me sideways when I told her that I was going to my ex-boyfriend 's wedding . Okay , so I understand that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " kind of situation . But , just because Trip is my ex-boyfriend from law school does n't mean that I care more about this wedding or am more nervous about this wedding , or that this wedding is any different from any other wedding in any way at all ! Because it 's not . Trip 's wedding is just another wedding . And Trip is just another friend of mine . Even if he is my ex-boyfriend . What 's an ex-boyfriend anyway ? Everyone has an ex-boyfriend . Everyone . I mean , even some lesbians I know have them . Nothing special about them , right ? I do n't care any more or less about him just because he 's my ex-boyfriend . He 's just a person . And staying friends with your ex is a piece of cake . I barely ever think about him and how he may or may not have been my last chance at happiness in this cruel and unforgiving world . Really . I have the satisfaction of having a great career and a great independent life filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . I am such a woman of the new millennium that I can go work a full ten-hour day , keep in touch with friends through e-mail , do a few errands on the way to meet my friends for dinner , and then go meet cute guys over martinis at the bar after I eat . All in three-and-a-half-inch heels . I am such a woman of the millennium that I can do anything , even things that previous generations would have thought completely impossible-Betty Friedan be damned ! I can even stay friends with an ex-boyfriend . And it 's not like Douglas was jealous or anything . Douglas was n't really the type to ever get jealous . He was far too manly and European for such things . When I told Jack , my best friend from Gilson Hecht , about Trip 's wedding , he simply said , " You and Douglas are going to break up . " " What ? , I practically screamed as I slammed the door to his office shut and sank into his visitor 's chair . His computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ref lection of his window that he was working on his fantasy football league . " Ignore me . I do n't even know what I 'm saying , " he said , one eye still on his computer screen as he f lipped it back to the brief he was drafting . " I think it 's great if you can go to your exboyfriend 's wedding . In fact , if we had dated and then broke up , I would fully expect you to come to my wedding . " " We did date and break up , " I reminded him , picking up the silver paperweight from his desk and turning it slowly in my hands . It was engraved Congratulations on Your Graduation and signed With Love from all three of his older sisters . " One kiss does not constitute us dating and breaking up , " he said , baby blues now burning into me , as he brushed his shaggy brown hair out of his eyes . This particular conversation always made Jack nervous for two reasons . The first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and being the gentleman that he was , he never liked to do anything that would make a woman unhappy . The second was that he hated the implication that he would ever act in such an unprofessional manner by running around kissing associates who were junior to him .
