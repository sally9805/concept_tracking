Excerpt // Contents // Introduction 1 // 1 // The Self-Made Oil Capital // Early in the twentieth century , it was inevitable that a big city // would develop somewhere in the desolate , rolling landscape that sat // above North America " s largest pool of oil . The Mid-Continent field , // beneath parts of Kansas , Oklahoma , and Texas , helped fuel the Model T // Fords that put Americans on the road , the trains that transported // them across the country , and the ships and planes that prevailed in // World War I. The field transformed a land of wheat , cotton , and // cattle into a vital industrial resource and turned tired villages // into vibrant cities . The city that best exploited this pool would be // crowned the Oil Capital of the World . // That city should not have been Tulsa , Oklahoma . // For all the oil that gushed from the Oklahoma soil , not a // drop was ever found in this prairie community on the edge of the // Ozark Plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ financing , and amenities that made their work possible and their // lives pleasant , but many other towns were far better suited to serve // them . Muskogee , fifty miles southeast of Tulsa , was the seat of the // federal government that ruled the Indian Territory that became the // eastern half of Oklahoma with statehood in 1907 . In 1905Muskogee had // 12,000 citizens  --  more than twice as many as Tulsa  --  as well as paved // streets , a trolley , and the seven-story Turner Hotel , the finest // lodging between Kansas City and Dallas . Also bigger than Tulsa was // nearby Bartlesville , which discovered oil in 1897 , as well as Vinita , // Claremore , Okmulgee , Sapulpa , and a dozen other settlements that // dotted the grasslands . They viewed Tulsa as a drab cattle town with // one railroad , a dirty train depot , and a huddle of crude wooden // houses . A visitor in 1905 recalled that the city lacked even its own // postcard . // Located along a curl in the Arkansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ozarks blend into the tawny landscape of the // Great Plains , Tulsa was settled in 1836 by Creek Indians from // Alabama . They called their village Lochapoka , " place of turtles . " The // first white settlers arrived in the early 1880s , but " Tulsey Town , " // as they called it , held little promise other than as a trading post // for farmers . At the turn of the century , it was literally a cow town , // with thousands of head of cattle routinely driven through its center , // rutting streets , trampling gardens , and trailing clouds of dirt . The // roads were dust storms in dry weather , swamps in rain . Residents // insisted that the streets not be wider than eighty feet  --  anything // greater was too far to walk in the mud . // Main Street was gray and pungent , with no sidewalks , // streetlights , or sewers . First and Second streets , littered with // watermelon rinds and horse apples , intersected Main . The smell of // freshly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // cash for hides and proudly hung on its storefront the pink carcasses // of deer , raccoons , rabbits , quail , and prairie chickens . Pigs and // cattle roamed the streets at will , and mosquitoes bred by the // millions in the rain barrels at each store , which offered the only // water for horse-drawn fire wagons . It sometimes wasn " t enough . In // 1897 a blaze destroyed the city " s first bank , three masonry // buildings , and twelve wooden structures . Schools and churches were // small white frame buildings , outhouses stood behind homes , and water // faucets disgorged clumps of dirt . The briny brown liquid came from // the Arkansas River , which was dangerous to drink ( wells provided a // limited supply of potable water ) and barely fit for bathing . River // water gathered in tubs left a thin layer of dirt , and bathers had to // towel the granules off their bodies . // The river was also an economic liability : its wide sandy bed // and sudden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground to a halt as cattle ambled in the river past the hapless // passenger boats . The Arkansas separated Tulsa from the oil and gas // fields west of the city , which gave other towns the edge in serving // the petroleum companies and their suppliers . // Other handicaps , both natural and manmade , deterred growth . // The long summers were inescapably hot , forcing families to sleep on // mattresses outside their homes . Tulsa had telephones  --  three hundred in // 1905  --  but no phone book . The city was further crippled by its // inadequate facilities ; raising money for public services was almost // impossible before statehood . When the Robinson Hotel , a converted // livery stable , was built in 1904 , the re was no sewage system , so the // hotel ran its waste into an open ditch a few blocks away . Protesting // neighbors won an injunction against the hotel , which eventually built // its own sewage lines directly to the river . Its owner then held // a " sewer banquet " for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frontier image was shaped by the spitfire cowboys // who rode into town , filled up on illegal whiskey , and dashed through // the streets shooting at lighted windows . They sometimes fired pistols // over the heads of congregants leaving church , the screams of the // women delighting the provocateurs . Tulsa tolerated outlaws , even // offering them sanctuary . Bill Doolin , whose gang terrorized banks , // trains , and post offices , was an occasional resident , and the four // Dalton brothers were fixtures . Their exploits robbing and terrorizing // innocents had been luridly described in the press , and they boldly // walked down Tulsa " s streets , ate at its caf ? s , attended its churches , // and purchased large quantities of gunpowder and ammunition from its // merchants . Rumors of Dalton raids sometimes forced shopkeepers to // barricade their stores with sugar sacks and barrels , and armed men // kept watch for the outlaws on rooftops . But the attacks never // materialized . Years later , Tulsans would fondly remember the Daltons // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " s renown as a haven // for bandits contributed to its lawless reputation . // In 1900 , only two years after its incorporation , Tulsa was a // grim , isolated backwater of 1,300 people , lost among the many prairie // towns of the Oklahoma and Indian territories . These communities were // soon dealt a devastating blow by technical advancements in // agriculture . The arrival of tractors and combines eliminated most // field hands . The sharecropper became expendable , and as marginal // farmers moved on , many towns and villages languished or disappeared // entirely . That could have been Tulsa " s fate . Instead , it became one // of the most remarkable boomtowns in American history , and it did so // with a can-do bravado and a shameless boosterism that shaped its self- // image for the rest of the century . // To survive and prosper , Tulsa " s pioneers first had to overcome the // physical and economic liabilities of the Arkansas River . // In 1901 the area " s first major oil discovery occurred at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tulsa . With newspapers across // the country trumpeting the " Great Oil Strike , " Red Fork drew throngs // of oil workers and investors , most of whom bypassed Tulsa to avoid // the expense and time of crossing the treacherous water on // unpredictable ferries . In response , Tulsa " s leaders wanted to build a // bridge across the Arkansas for pedestrians and wagons , so they // submitted a bond issue ; voters , suspecting the oil craze would be // short-lived , defeated it . It looked like Tulsa would miss its chance . // But three private citizens raised $50,000 on their own and built a // toll crossing , the 11th Street Wagon Bridge . Opening on January 4 , // 1904 , the steel bridge soon carried the tools and lumber traveling to // Red Fork . Its inscription read : YOU SAID WE COULDN " T DO IT , BUT WE // DID . // Near this bridge was an older crossing used by Tulsa " s one // railroad , the Frisco . Business leaders prodded the Frisco to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fork oil fields so that // workers could escape from the grease and grime . Each morning , the // oilmen from Tulsa ate a massive breakfast at the Pig " s Ear , across // from the train station , while the proprietor " s wife packed their // lunches . Then they boarded a fifteen-car train called Coal Oil // Johnny , which passed through Sapulpa and dropped off workers in and // around Red Fork . In the evening it brought them back to Tulsa , where // a boomtown was slowly taking shape . The drillers , tool dressers , // roustabouts , and investors rubbed elbows with the railroad men , // cowboys , and merchants as they sat down to the best fried chicken in // all the oil country . // Ultimately , the Red Fork strike produced far less petroleum // than expected . Its peak of a hundred barrels a day fell short of a // great gusher , and its production soon dissipated to five or six daily // barrels . But Tulsa had established its name in the oil patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more important // was linking Tulsa to the rail network that was now connecting // destinations in the Oklahoma and Indian territories and beyond . The // pioneers did not leave this matter to luck or fate . In 1901 the Katy // Railroad announced plans to complete a line from Muskogee to // Pawhuska ; the new rails would cross the Frisco tracks about seven // miles east of Tulsa , sending its traffic to competing towns . All the // oil in the world wouldn " t save Tulsa if the trains were taking the // financiers and roughnecks to other communities , so the city " s leaders // hastily formed the Tulsa Commercial Club , which later became the // Chamber of Commerce . Club officials approached Katy " s executives with // their own survey and insisted that running the line through Tulsa // would create a shorter and less expensive route to their final // destination . To help persuade the railroad men , the Tulsans also // pledged to secure a right-of-way ( valued at $3,000 ) and gave // a " bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( or about $239,000 in // 2000 dollars ) that came in a promissory note underwritten by // virtually every merchant and business in the city . Tulsa got the // railroad , and the businessmen who represented the city grew rich in // the coming oil bonanza . Three years later , the Commercial Club used // the same strategy to forge another link to the outside world when the // Midland Valley Railroad announced it would place a line through Red // Fork . To convince the Midland officials to direct their rail through // Tulsa , this time the " bonus " was $15,000 . That year the city also // convinced another railroad ( the Santa Fe ) to redirect its tracks // through Tulsa , this time with no financial sweeteners . // Coaxing the railroads to Tulsa secured the city " s future as // the major distribution point for the petroleum industry throughout // the Southwest , and it sealed the doom of its immediate rivals , // including Red Fork . What " s more , it established a pattern that was // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a problem , its // business leaders solved it . They were self-made men building a self- // made city , and their work had just begun . They had figured out how to // bring people to Tulsa on rail and over water ; now they devised a plan // to attract those people . They needed a massive public relations // campaign ( before public relations had even been invented ) , and they // got it with their barnstorming boosters . // In 1905 Tulsa " s leaders decided to take the story of their // city directly to the country . One hundred of the town " s leading // citizens donated one hundred dollars each and chartered a train to // carry them 2,500 miles through scores of midwestern cities and towns . // This group was dubbed the One Hundred Club , although only eighty nine // men actually went . On the eve of their departure , their wives and // children worked throughout the night to decorate the train with // streamers and banners touting Tulsa as oil country . Attached to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oklahoma and Indian territories // and a picture of a large derrick . Outsiders thought the venture // pointless . Tulsa was not on most maps , so why would anyone move there ? // But the One Hundred Club created its own frenzy . The men sent // telegrams to other cities " business clubs and newspapers asking to be // met at the train depot so they " could induce a few hundred men of // money to locate in the greatest city in the world . " The train carried // a printing press borrowed from the Tulsa Democrat ; at each stop , it // cranked out pretentious news pages , one of which read in part : // Tulsa wasn " t on the map because it grew faster than maps can be // printed . // Tulsa was a magnificent metropolis of seven churches and not a single // saloon . // The clink of one dollar against the other was in Tulsa " s national air . // Wearing bowler hats and dark overcoats , the Tulsans brought // their trombones , tubas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop by blaring songs and waving American flags . But they also needed // a feature act to turn out the crowds , so they asked a young cowboy // named Bill Rogers , who lived in Claremore , twenty-nine miles away , to // join them . Years later , as Will Rogers , his virtuoso roping skills // were captured in movies , and his wit earned him fame as a writer and // humorist . But on this trip he dazzled crowds with his lariat  --  he roped // a group of men in the pit of the Chicago Board of Trade  --  and fashioned // Tulsa " s reputation as a magical place . // The booster train created a windfall of publicity for Tulsa. // The prestigious St. Louis Post-Dispatch , for example , wrote : " Down in // Tulsa , the y have a theory that whatever helps the town helps the // citizens . It " s a pretty good theory too . It makes nations as well as // cities great . " // The publicity surrounding the trip was so great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , even more ambitious // excursion . This time they promoted both their young city and their // new state of Oklahoma , established the previous year . They traveled // through Kansas City , St. Louis , and Chicago , then eastward to // Cleveland , Pittsburgh , and New York , ending in Washington , D . C.  --  // fifteen states and 2,972 miles in sixteen days . The band and the // printing press were back , and a Creek and a Cherokee joined them as // swarthy reminders of the city " s Indian tradition . //
