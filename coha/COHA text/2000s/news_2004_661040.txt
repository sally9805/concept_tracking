<p> The good folks at csmonitor.com kindly gave me the opportunity to participate in one of the great political events of our time ; to make my voice heard ; to engage in an important act of public service . But I had already registered to vote , so instead I told them I 'd write about the presidential conventions . <p> Their logic was unassailable : the conventions are on television , they said . You watch television . A lot of television . Why do n't you give us your take on the conventions as a television watcher . I responded that as a television watcher , my take was that I was n't going to watch them at all . <p> The networks , which we all know are the only true determinants of value and import ( through them , for example , I 've learned how vital it is to pay close attention to the thoughts of Paris Hilton and to value the contributions of crime scene investigators above almost any other job ) , have cut down convention coverage to three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention I should pay . <p> Besides , I said ( my voice rising slightly ) , it was n't like I was going to learn anything , or see anything interesting or unexpected . What , was I going to wake up on Tuesday , and have my friends say , " Dude , you ca n't believe it . They nominated Al Sharpton , and you just had to see the look on Kerry 's face " ? <p> But then I thought about it : it 's not like surprises are necessary to my television enjoyment . When I watch " Law and Order " , I never sit on the edge of my seat wondering if this time maybe they 'll dispense with the whole courtroom side of things , or if this time Gilligan and Co. are really going to get off the island . It 's not about the unexpected ; it 's about how well the show carries off exactly what you expected . <p> So I agreed to do it . I sat myself down to watch the prime time coverage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course , that as a television watcher and mass consumer of entertainment , I have to think of all television in terms of other genres or programs . You know - saying something like , this new program is " Seinfeld " set in outer space - that sort of thing . <p> As I watched , I became gradually aware that I had seen this show before , not in 2000 , or 1996 , but every year in between , and several times each year - whenever I see the Emmys , or Oscars , or Grammys , or any other of the thousands of awards shows that seem to be cluttering up the airwaves like kudzu with gift bags . <p> There was the interior , with the soothing primary colors , the massive set pieces , the walls of video screens . There was the somewhat awkward and always vaguely insulting salute to a particular group of distinguished people - in this case , Democratic women senators , who you 'd think the Democrats could just honor as , you know , people . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to sit through because they 're filling time to excite you for the good stuff ( in the Oscars , this role is always taken by the president of the Motion Picture Association of America ; here , his part was played by Wisconsin Rep. Tammy Baldwin , whose speech on health care did the trick quite nicely . ) <p> And there were the musical numbers of massively varying quality , from what was described simply as " a choral interlude " to the violin version of " Amazing Grace " to Patti LaBelle , who does n't quite seem to be exactly a sign that the Democrats are looking to the future , musically speaking . ( With all the connections they 're supposed to have in the music industry , could n't they have gotten the Dave Matthews Band ? ) <p> Nor should we forget to mention the annoyingly cutesy specific musical play-ins : " Georgia on My Mind " for Jimmy Carter , and " New York State of Mind " for Hillary Clinton . Yes , he 's from Georgia , she 's currently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill Richardson tried channeling Billy Crystal ( though his shtick was n't quite up to the same level ) . Then , there 's always the risk of going over your time and being played off . ( President Clinton ran slightly over his time , disappointing the literally dozens of Americans who had TiVo 'd the convention coverage . ) <p> And there was the public kiss-and-make-up by the two big figures who all the newspapers and magazines had been reporting were n't on speaking terms : Al Gore 's effusive thanks to Bill Clinton was so over the top that you could n't help imagining that they were coming out together because now they had a new product to promote - which is , I suppose , nothing more than the truth . <p> Clinton 's speech , incidentally , was a remarkable combination of the charming self-deprecation of the rich and famous man who presents himself as being just like normal folks , and also gives the strong sense that he is in fact nothing of the sort : in short , he 's just like every huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> There was the speaker who took advantage of her forum to pitch her own projects : it 's a little less annoying when Hillary Clinton talks up more post-9/11 aid to New York than when Ben Stiller comes on an awards show dressed in character from his new movie to promote it ( after all , Clinton has the advantage of being absolutely right on this issue , whereas Stiller 's " Starsky and Hutch " has its detractors as well as its defenders ) , but still . <p> And there was the memorial for those who have died since the last time this organization got together , in the 9/11 memorial ( with Glenn Close doing the introduction , no less . ) <p> And , most importantly , there was the honorary eminence grise , who was selected to appear for his elder stature no less than his actual qualifications , and , like in all such ceremonies , was welcomed with a tribute video . Carter , for those of us who have no real memory of him as president , came across as the statesman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of Georgia goes a long way . <p> Though , like many eminence grises at such events , Carter used his august role to deliver the subtle knife : playing the military card heavily , even referring obliquely to the charges about Bush 's absence from military leave , and his reference to a " virtually unbroken series of mistakes and miscalculations " on the part of the administration made sure that his presence would be remembered . <p> So , were there any differences at all between this and , say , the Oscars ? Well , even though I 'm sure security would n't have allowed a red carpet ( and , if there is any justice , they would n't have allowed Joan Rivers either ) , there would n't have been a lot to show there : let 's just say that the Democratic convention is n't quite the place for couture . <p> This may be the only place in the United States of America where Al Gore receives a rapturous ovation . And is there anywhere else in the country where someone , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clinton doll unironically ? And , somewhat unbelievably , nobody thanked their agent , not even Bill Clinton , whose literary agent deserves a thank you if anyone ever did . <p> But , you know , here 's the big difference between the DNC and an awards show : no one actually got the award . <p> And three hours is a pretty long time to go with no payoff whatsoever on what is actually an award show . Especially with the current television-inspired miniscule attention span I now have . So I 'm somewhat fearful about the next three days . <p> But I 'll be sitting here watching and reporting ; they 've promised me a gift bag , and I 'm waiting to see if they 've thrown in a Hillary doll . <p> ( c ) Copyright 2004 .
