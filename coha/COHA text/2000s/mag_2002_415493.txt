The American Illustrators ' Hall of Fame Hair-raising memories from the barbershop led Post artists to many a clever cover illustration  --  and readers always got their two bits ' worth . <p> You may remember the one about the woman who said she had no need of a curling iron . All she required was to make her husband mad ; the ensuing language alone was enough to make her hair curl . <p> Our cover selections this issue portray a variety of good and bad hair experiences . There 's the young lad who is not at all pleased with having his preferred " hairdo n't " changed to a proper hairdo . Which brings to mind Sir Walter Scott 's line from The Lay of the Last Minstrel : " Yet somewhat was he chill 'd with dread/And his hair did bristle upon his head . " <p> Then it 's the boy getting trimmed up for Sunday visitors . The head of the house undergoing Norman Rockwell 's version of " the works . " The barber scoring a touchdown rather than a touchup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " old gang of mine " blending in harmony while lather dries on the shavee 's face . <p> As for the ridin ' , ropin ' , yipee-o-kyopin ' cowpoke , he has poked his last steer until Mom emerges from the confines of that hair dryer . <p> Further on , we find ourselves in four barber chairs . In one , the artist illustrates one of the perks of the tonsilory profession  --  free haircuts . In another , the customer already has been clipped and is assessing the handiwork . Finally , in the back-to-back chairs , the couple somehow manages to look adoringly upon each other 's new bobs in the mirror . Which arouses suspicion that the artist will not have us looking at his work long enough to notice that this can not be done . Or what do you think ? <p> Does n't this remind you of A.E . Housman 's lines from The Oracles : " The Spartans on the sea-wet rock sat down and combed their hair " ? At least this young man has assumed the expression of sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But not to sorrow . He 'll surely mess it up again once he 's out the door . Whether he 'll smile again for the rest of the day remains in doubt . <p> You 've heard of " dog days " ? This also applies to the home barber shop . It may be " just a little off the top " or a real air conditioner for the scalp , but the poor customer has little , if anything , to say about it . At least the next one in line for the barber chair will have some idea of what awaits him . There 's always the chance , of course , that he may leave home after seeing the hair style his best friend has fallen heir to . <p> Oh , what fun Mr. Rockwell surely had with this one . From the customer 's expression , the towel now draped over the victim 's ears has been heated to at least 160 degrees . Or is that the temperature of the water he has just stuck his hand into ? Another guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up an extra dime , has just banked the back of his brush off the customer 's ankle . <p> It 's all the boy 's doing . He should have chosen something less exciting for his reading material . Like , say , the Old Farmer 's Almanac or the Barber 's Quarterly . But after selecting something the barber ca n't take his eyes from , the result ends up with the customer getting a head-shave and a haircut all in one bargain package . The best that can be said for it , it follows our headline to a T. <p> Referring to A.E . Housman again , in The Name and Nature of Poetry , " Experience has taught me , when I am shaving of a morning , to keep watch over my thoughts , because if a line of poetry strays into my memory , my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act . " Norman Rockwell put three melodic barbers and a customer together , and the result appears to have a like effect . <p> This cover by Kurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a little bronco buster in a five-gallon hat or a grown woman in a space helmet ? Somewhere along the washing , cutting , rolling , cold-waving , neutralizing , rinsing , setting , drying , and combing processes , little Two-Gun has fallen asleep , perhaps dreaming of a land peopled by wild Indians who had even more permanent plans for a female scalp . <p> There are times when you ca n't believe everything on an old Post cover . Artist Stevan Dohanos ' signature is real . But the boss of the barbershop was rejected because he did n't look like the boss of a barbershop . As for the man in the chair , he is actually a man off the street who needed a haircut as desperately as a bald eagle . The man doing the trimming is not a barber but only the boss ' assistant , who looks like a barber . <p> Mirror , mirror , face to face/ You are surely out of place . No way could he see her and she see him . So you must look at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are ogling each other . We can only hope that in their excitement , neither will whirl about at the same time in the same direction and crush all four kneecaps which would delay the possible wedding for who knows how long . <p> Artist George Hughes used to believe he would really be a big shot when the day came that he could climb into a barber chair and instruct the barber , " I 'll have the works . " This fine , expansive feeling during his younger years inspired the artist to paint a cover about it  --  note the jutted jaw of the proud young customer . <p>
