Never mind that Skin ( FOX , Mondays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) is the first network series about a porn czar , that it involves a steamy teen romance and that its title is , well , Skin . According to creator Jim Leonard , the drama  --  the story of a Los Angeles district attorney 's crusade to take down an adult-film mogul and their kids ' star-crossed love  --  is not about sex . It 's about politics , anxiety and money . <P> Tomato , to-mah-to . On Skin , politics , anxiety and money are the very definition of 21st century American sex , in which desire and guilt dance their eternal lambada to the frantic beat of the electro-media . In Skin 's world , come-ons for sex chat compete for TV time with pictures of abducted girls on Amber Alerts . In Skin 's world , D.A . Thomas Roam ( Kevin Anderson ) runs his re-election campaign on an antismut crusade , while his target , Larry Goldman ( Ron Silver ) , quips , " If the voters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a 52,000-sq. - ft. mansion ? " ( And both men are powerless to control the hormones of their children , who meet and fall in love . ) In Skin 's world , a generation that grew up taking sexual liberties is rearing kids and now wants to take those liberties back , please . <P> The idea , says Leonard , had two inspirations : his daily routine of deleting unwanted porn e-mails from his teenage sons ' computer and his overhearing two mothers at his gym discussing whether to let their 13-year-old daughters get their navels pierced . " Their conversation , " he says , " was really about the same issue , the sexualization of children and youth culture . " ( Raising that subject on the network that gives us The O.C. and Paradise Hotel is either denial or genius . ) <P> Is America ready to make a pornographer into the next Tony Soprano ? Leonard and his stars say yes , on the grounds that porn is more " mainstream " than ever . It 's accessible on computers , in hotel rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Friends ; Pamela Anderson voices a pole dancer on Spike TV 's cartoon Stripperella ; porn chic is embraced by pop stars from Blink 182 to Kid Rock to Madonna . <P> Of course , if porn were truly mainstream , it would cease to be dirty and thus cease to be porn . ( Would you be reading this article if Skin were set in the aluminum industry ? ) But porn is definitely Big Business  --  estimated at $10 billion a year  --  and as Skin emphasizes , much of that goes into the coffers of blue-chip hotel chains , media companies and cable operators ( such as Time Warner , the parent company of TIME ) . In the pilot , Goldman 's company negotiates a partnership with DirecTV  --  the satellite service that , in real life , Fox 's parent company , News Corp. , has struck a deal to control . " Certainly , " says Leonard dryly , " Fox asked us to change the name of the company " in the version that will air .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
