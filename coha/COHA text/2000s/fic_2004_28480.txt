Chapter One Erin Marshall first noticed the van a little before 6:00 p.m . She was n't sure why it caught her eye , since there were still quite a few cars parked in the paved area roped off from the Healthy Children 's Fund carnival , which she 'd helped organize . It was n't just the peeling beige paint or dented bumper that drew her attention . Despite Orange County 's reputation for affluence , the daylong carnival in the centrally located city of Tustin had drawn not only late-model cars and SUVs , but also plenty of old clunkers . Maybe it was the way the van lurked to one side , half-hidden in the shade of an office building that sat empty on a Saturday . And the fact that , despite an obscuring shadow , she could tell there was someone sitting behind the wheel , unmoving as the minutes ticked by . Was he waiting for someone ? Why did n't he come out and enjoy the September sunshine ? " Wan na buy a candy bar ? " a girl 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ van . Before the booth where she 'd been handing out pamphlets stood a teenage volunteer with one thick , nutty chocolate bar left on her tray . " I just have to sell this one and I can go home , " the girl said . " You look hungry . How about it ? " It was on the tip of Erin 's tongue to say , " I ca n't eat that stuff . " Even though she was only twenty-six , she 'd stuck strictly - well , almost strictly - to health food since a heart attack killed her father two years ago . What was a couple of dollars ? And she had skipped lunch , and for heaven 's sake , it was one chocolate bar . " Sure . " She fished a few crumpled bills from her shoulder bag . " Thanks ! " With a grin , the girl handed it over and hurried toward the cashier 's booth . Beyond her , workmen were disassembling the carnival rides on a far section of the asphalt . The scents of popcorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closed up shop . People streamed by , heading home . From the parking area , Erin registered the sound of cars starting . No one seemed the least bit interested in taking a pamphlet describing the fund 's free health screening programs . After tucking away the candy to savor at leisure , she decided to make the rounds to see if anyone needed help closing up shop . Although many tradespeople had decamped , it was her responsibility , as administrative assistant at Conrad Promotions , to keep things running smoothly . Erin glanced toward the building . The van had n't gone anywhere . It probably belonged to one of the craftspeople , she told herself . Any minute , the driver would get out and begin loading unsold wares . Still , she felt vulnerable . For comfort , she instinctively touched the gold pendant nestled against the front of her blue Healthy Children 's Fund T-shirt . It was hard to say why she 'd worn it today . Although she sometimes took it out of the drawer simply to enjoy the precious memories it stirred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worn the jagged half heart design . Maybe it was because , after tomorrow , she 'd never be able to wear it again . It reminded her of someone she 'd once loved , someone who 'd probably thrown away the other half of the heart years ago . Erin wished that did n't bother her so much . A tablecloth flapped in her path , startling her . " I 'm sorry ! I did n't see you , " called a woman shaking wrinkles from the fabric . She 'd already tucked her unsold teddy bears into a box beneath her display table . " I hope your sales went well , " Erin said . " Terrific ! " That was good news , since the fund netted a percentage of everything sold . Erin moved on through the nearly empty carnival section . She was about to check on the van again when a boy of about four pelted toward her . Behind him lagged his weary mother , pushing a baby stroller . " Whoa ! " Erin held out one arm . " Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her . " I want to go home ! " " Are you planning to drive the car yourself ? " she asked . " Can I ? " he asked hopefully . " Well , no , so I guess you better wait for your mother . " That seemed logical to Erin , but the little boy 's face reddened . " I 'm hungry ! " he wailed . " I 'm sure your mom will feed you as soon as she can , " she said . The woman caught up in time to hear the last remark . " We ate about an hour ago , but he was too excited to finish his sandwich . I promised to split a chocolate bar with him , but I ca n't find any . " At the thought of the candy tucked into her purse , Erin 's stomach growled . Despite her devotion to health food - or perhaps because of it - she could almost taste the chocolate melting on her tongue and the nuts crunching between her teeth . The little boy whined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Erin took out the bar and handed it to the woman . " It 's courtesy of Conrad Promotions . We want everyone to go away happy . " " How kind ! I 'll pay for it , of course . " She reached for her wallet . " It 's on the house . " " Are you sure ? " Receiving a nod , she said , " That 's great ! Thank you . " The mother broke the candy bar in two and gave a piece to her son . The smell of chocolate drifted through Erin 's senses . Her stomach rumbled again . She hoped nobody heard it over the clamor of workmen dismantling the rides . " Have a good evening . " " You too ! " After the family left , Erin could n't find a single food stand open . Well , she 'd eat a yogurt later at her apartment . " Erin ! " Bea Conrad waved from the cashier 's booth . The owner of Conrad Promotions had a friendly face and fluffy honey-colored hair . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her usual tailored suits made her look younger than her late thirties . Erin strode in her direction . " Anything I can do ? " " Actually , yes . I have a favor to ask , " Bea said . " Name it . " Too late , it occurred to Erin that she might get stuck here without dinner . Well , she 'd survive . Maybe . " What a great attitude ! I hope I 'm not going to lose you . " Bea shook her head apologetically . " Do n't mind me . Chet 's a real catch . When are you giving him your answer ? " " He 's driving down tomorrow . " Erin felt an inexplicable urge to touch her heart pendant again . She did n't want to talk about Chet . " How were the receipts ? " " Even better than last year , " Bea said . " I do n't have the final numbers , but I 'm guessing the profit will be around fifteen thousand . That 's not counting our mysterious benefactor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sneak a cashier 's check into the donation box again this year . " " Let 's not complain about it , " Erin teased . " How much was it this time ? " " Twenty thousand , " Bea said . " It 's from Friend of a Friend Foundation again . I 'm surprised you never heard of them . I mean , you are from Sundown Valley , and that 's where they 're located . But I guess you do n't pay much attention to what goes on there anymore . " Erin shrugged and said nothing . In fact , she subscribed to the Sundown Sentinel and kept close tabs on her hometown . " I do n't know why they 're so mysterious . " Bea had telephoned the previous year and learned only that the foundation made donations to worthy causes on behalf of an anonymous sponsor . " Well , I 'm not going to look a gift horse in the mouth . " " What was the favor ? " Erin asked . ( Continues ... )     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
