<p> Michael Moore got it all wrong about the French health care system in his new movie , " Sicko . " The best part is n't that the government sends workers out to the homes of new mothers to do their laundry . It 's that French hospital meals come with wine . <p> I do n't know how Moore , who seems rather starry-eyed over la belle France in the film , forgot to include that nugget . <p> Because my wife Jeri 's health has always been brittle , we 've gotten a first-hand look  --  thankfully a brief one  --  at the health-care systems of many of the countries featured in " Sicko . " Moreover , for years now I 've been quizzing people around the world about their systems  --  the good parts and the bad . It 's my go-to conversation-starter in pubs and cafes . <p> So I thought I 'd join the gum-flapping over " Sicko " with some things I 've seen in the hospitals of France , Australia and Cuba . And because there 's no such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state for the record that I agree broadly with Moore 's premise  --  that the U.S. health care system is badly broken and we should to take a good long look at a single-payer system  --  even if some of his evidence does n't jibe with what I 've seen in my travels . <p> My Cuban hospital , for example , looked nothing like Moore 's Cuban hospital . <p> In the most attention-getting segment of the film , Moore takes a group of ailing 9/11 rescue workers to Havana for treatment denied by their insurance companies . The hospital is crisp and sparkling and equipped with the latest technology ; it could pass for UCSF or Stanford Medical Center . <p> But I 'd bet my last convertible peso that this particular hospital is reserved for high-ranking party officials and their families , and that if Moore was aware this was a propaganda set-up , he willingly went along with it . <p> The Cuban hospital I saw in 2002 was in the colonial city of Trinidad , down the coast from the Bay of Pigs , and everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked as rusty and ramshackle as the vintage Studebakers rumbling through the streets . Its pharmacy shelves were nearly bare . The place looked like something you might have seen in rural Mississippi in 1958 . This , I had to believe , was a hospital for rank-and-file Cubans . <p> While Moore might have been snookered by a Potemkin hospital , he barely mentioned what I came to see as the real strength of Cuba 's health care system : The medical clinics in virtually every neighborhood . <p> In Trinidad , there 's one such clinic for every 75 households . The doctor is required to live there , in an upstairs apartment . In the morning he and a nurse are available for drop-in visits ; in the afternoon they go door-to-door to check up on neighborhood residents . The doctor told me he 's required to visit each household three times a year . This kind of hands-on care is possible , he said , because Cuban medical schools produce an awful lot of doctors . <p> " In Cuba , " he told me , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But what we have is human capital . " <p> My introduction to the French health care system came years ago in Menton , an unpretentious slice of the Cte d'Azur between Monaco and the Italian border . Jeri had been feeling nauseated and increasingly feverish for a couple of days , and when her tongue turned black I got her to the hospital , pronto . <p> As U.S. citizens , we were n't eligible for free health care , but when we checked in the hospital did n't seem terribly concerned about how , when or even if it would be reimbursed . All they asked for was her name and a telephone number where I could be reached . <p> Jeri got a private room with a great view of the sparking Mediterranean ; it was far more comfortable than the fleabag hotel where we were staying . At dinner time the nurse came in with a dinner tray that included a glass of Ctes du Rhne . <p> " Wine is very important for health , no ? " she said with a smile . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of too much Pepto-Bismol ( this is apparently common ; read the fine print on the label ) , and the nausea and fever went away before they could figure out what was causing it . <p> We could easily have walked out without paying . No one was quite sure who we were supposed to pay , or how much . Eventually we left $100 in travelers ' checks with the woman at the front desk and told her to call us if that was n't enough . Apparently it was , because we never heard from them . ( Jeri had a very similar experience a few months later in Sydney , Australia , with similar results . ) <p> One important point Moore does n't make about French health care is the efficient way it handles some of the minor medical problems that clog up our system . <p> We discovered this one morning a few years ago in Paris , when Jeri woke up with an itchy , goopy eye . It was almost crusted shut and looked , to put it mildly , rather alarming . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if there were any medical clinics in the neighborhood , and the woman directed us to a pharmacy around the corner . <p> " " But do n't we need to see a doctor first ? " I asked . " Do n't we need to have someone write a prescription ? " <p> " Go talk to the pharmacist , " said the hotel clerk , shooing us out the door . <p> The pharmacist , a young woman in a white lab coat who seemed to have a fair amount of medical training , asked Jeri a few questions to make sure it was n't an allergy , and then , confident that it was n't , correctly diagnosed the problem as conjunctivitis  --  pink eye . She sold us some antibiotic eye drops and sent us on our way . <p> Total elapsed time , door to door : Less than 10 minutes . Total cost : 8.80 euros ( about $12.15 ) . <p> It 's foolish , of course , to extrapolate too much from these little stories . Still , as the national conversation over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through some of the blather on both sides with first-hand accounts from other lands . <p> What experiences have you had ? I 'd love to hear about travel stories that either confirm or negate the observations I 've just made , or those in " Sicko . " Or that raise other issues . This is not the forum for generalized rants about Michael Moore , France , Cuba or the wonders/evils of socialized medicine . Please stick to your actual experiences with the health care systems of other nations , and add your comments online to my column at sfgate.com/travelsick . I 'll publish as many as I can in an upcoming column .
