It 's My Fault and Yours Too FRIEDA EASED her pregnant body out of the large , carved walnut bed in the family quarters of their hotel and tiptoed to the wash basin on the bureau . " Everything 's going to be all right , " she muttered as she washed the hot night 's grainy residue from her face and arms . Nothing had ever been all right in Dos Cacahuates . She rinsed her mouth with the tepid water , then sprayed it on the shriveled potted palm nearby . We 're doing all we can , she grumbled silently . Asking stage drivers to keep their eyes open and writing to sheriffs on the Rutherfords ' itinerary was not doing all they could . As Frieda slid her arms out of her nightgown and into a loose , white cotton dress she heard Bennie yawning and clearing his throat . A moment later , her naked husband ambled to the chamber pot in the corner , and then to the wash basin . Frieda grabbed her worn hightops . " Where you off to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoes and reached for her ragged straw hat . " Fried ' ? " " The First Lady . " " To do what ? " He 'd wrapped a towel around his midsection and was moving through the furniture-choked room toward her . Frieda told him what , but not why . " Eight months pregnant , least a hundred and five degrees by noon , and you 're going to spend the day in that hot box making green corn tamales ? " Gathering her curly brown hair into a topknot , she dangled a foot at her husband . He dropped to his knees to tie her shoelaces . " You 're worn out . Why do n't you loll around the hotel today ? " " Doa Eufemia suggested a remedio . " " Like what ? " " Fix a delicious homecoming supper and then repeat three times , venga , venga , mi amor , su cena est lista para " His quizzical look halted her . " I can run back and forth to the lookout point all day , or I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What time 's supper ? " he called as she headed for the door . At ten that morning , Frieda was standing at a table in the tiny , torrid kitchen of the First Lady Restaurant husking newly picked corn . A wet cabbage leaf lay on her head and fat drops of water trailed down the sides of her round , flushed face . With her was Soo Fat , her helper . A mess boy on Chinese vessels since he was twelve , Soo had jumped ship in Guaymas in 1883 when he was sixteen and had hopped a ride on a wagon train headed for Dos Cacahuates . When a wily prospector about to give up and get out heard Soo had one hundred and fifty dollars , he hustled him to the First Lady where he wooed him with Frieda 's machaca . Two days later Frieda made the mess boy turned mine owner an offer : meals , a bed , and ten percent of the restaurant 's eventual profits . When the heat in the First Lady kitchen wore down the seafaring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at their fellow Dos Cacahuatans , at last count , eighty-nine and dwindling . That afternoon 's target was Mrs. Bidenbach , the owner of Der Edelweiss , a three-table restaurant next to Frieda 's five-table . Hand on his thin hip , his face wrinkled with distaste , Soo shrilled , " Tamayess tainted . Better you eat mine veenahsneetzel . " Encouraged by Frieda 's chuckle , he dropped his knife and moved center stage . Skinny rear end thrust back , concave chest pushed forward , he hissed , " Mrs. Goldson 's tamayees no good , you womit for a veek . " " Womit a veek ? " Frieda played along , then reconsidered . " A thousand miles from home , and not a clue of how to get back . What do we want from that poor widow ? " Soo was back at her side at the table when Bennie shuffled in . She knew that to be the case because creaking door hinges , Soo 's flashing knife , and flying corn kernels were part of her mental image of her husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew at once something was wrong . Bennie was hatless . He always wore his tan Stetson , especially in the June heat . He was silent . Even when they were mad enough to throw knives at each other , he greeted her . He appeared grief-stricken . Bennie and grief were not on speaking terms . " Something 's happened , " Frieda said , dropping the corn husks from her hands . He nodded , his brown eyes lowered , his fingers running through his curly red hair . " To the Rutherfords . " Her husband affirmed her guess with a mournful nod . Swaying precariously , one hand on her bulging abdomen , the other splayed against her cheek , she croaked , " Bennie , not Ida . He grabbed a chair from alongside the wood stove and eased her into it . " Tell me Ida 's all right , " she pleaded . " Appears to be . " " Where is she ? " He tried to speak . No sound came out . Jaw muscles clenched , he thrust the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ County , Arizona Territory , Office of Sheriff Alton C. Follett . It was dated May 30 , 1886 . Frieda searched through the dense sentences until she found the words that had muted her husband . " Richard , Evaline , even little Penelope murdered ? " She let the letter fall into her lap , unable to swallow the vile news in a single gulp . " Some kind of joke , is n't it ? Six years and your stupid pals still think they 're toying with a tenderfoot . " " No one 's joking , " Bennie said , his voice soft with regret , his hand cupping her shoulder . Frieda shrugged it off . " Where is she ? " " With Pearson . " " Thank God , thank God . " Frieda picked up the letter again and tried to read , but her eyes would n't focus . " How did the sheriff know to contact us ? " " He had that letter I wrote . " " Where are Pearson and Ida now ? " " They were last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Arizona border . " " When ? " " May third . " Frieda 's eyes sought her husband 's . " Today 's June fifth . " He turned away , wincing . " Bennie , look at me . Pearson did in the Rutherfords ? " He cranked his head in her direction . " So it seems . " " Now he 's got Ida . What does he want with Ida ? She 's barely fourteen , and so tiny and delicate she looks eleven . " Rising , Frieda rasped , " Oh my God , I recommended Pearson to Richard Rutherford . " " Pearson agreed to work for food and a mount . Richard had eight inches , fifty pounds , and a wagonload of wit on the little runt . Besides , Pearson was unarmed , Rutherford made sure of that , and he had a small arsenal . " " He was hard-working , courteous " " Things happen , Frieda . You ca n't blame yourself . " " I do blame myself and you , too . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sense left Dos Cacahuates years ago . " " No use getting into that now . " " Ida 's as safe with the Rutherfords as at home on Tehama Street , ' " she said , mimicking her husband 's country drawl . " All you care about is proving Bennie Goldson right and " Rage mottling her shock-blanched face , eyes glassy , she was swaying like a drunk . " You need to calm down , sweetheart . " As he spoke , Bennie came toward her , one arm extended , one hand pulling a small bottle from his pocket . Hoisting her upright , he raised the smelling salts to her nose . She batted his hand aside . With a beckoning glance , Bennie summoned Soo . His thin face mirroring Frieda 's distraught state , Soo rushed to Bennie 's side . Clutching her head as though it belonged to a chicken about to be butchered , he cried , " Breathe , Doa Fridita , breathe . " Frieda inhaled once , then again . As her head cleared , another blow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me not to let her go . He 'll hold me r-r-respons " she stammered , gasping for air " sible . " Tears bounced off her cheeks and on to the embroidered birds on the bodice of her dress . " We 'll think about your father later , " her husband soothed . " I 've got to find her , " Frieda sputtered , lumbering toward the door . Bennie darted in front of her , arms spread . Teeth bared , she threw herself against him , pummeling his chest and kicking his shins , until , begging her not to hurt herself , he gave way . Outside Frieda fixed her gaze on the wagon road just beyond the empty , heat-baked main street lined with mostly boarded-up stores . She started walking , Bennie and Soo at her heels . Passed Der Edelweiss , Chevalier 's Livery , she was approaching Goldson Brothers General Merchandise when the fetus inside her shifted from her left to her right side . She stopped and pressed her hand against a protruding knob . A rush of water swooshed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the sand beneath her feet . She looked down at the darkened area , then back at Bennie and Soo . " Find Ida later , " Soo urged . " You ca n't go nowhere now . " Stunned by his contorted features , trembling limbs , and tear-glazed eyes , Frieda 's legs buckled . Her husband slipped an arm around her waist and gathered her against his wall-like bulk . " We 'll get you up to the hotel . Angelina will see to you , and I 'll get Ramn to take the boys down to their house for the night . " As she inched up the slope between the men , she gave Soo instructions . " Finish the tamales . You know what to do . Use only the good white cheese in the cooler . Do n't skimp . Remember , Soo , no lard , just butter , but not too much , the Rutherfords do n't like greasy tamales. " * * * Several hours later , Frieda awoke from a laudanum-induced sleep , a band of pain circling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swift and brutal as the news that had precipitated it . She screamed until she was as hoarse as a mule driver and thrashed her arms and legs as though she were being murdered . Bennie and Angelina had to hold her down to keep her from hurting herself and the baby . At the end of a two-hour-long struggle , she let out a long parturient grunt and pushed from her womb a blood-coated female infant . " A girl , just what you wanted , " Angelina cried out . Her newly-collapsed abdomen sagging in furrows , her voice gone , her will spent , Frieda lay as still as a corpse while Angelina washed her , fixed a roll of cotton between her legs , pulled a fresh nightgown over her head , and gave her more laudanum . As the drug was dimming what remained of her battered consciousness , Frieda lay eyes closed , listening to the baby trying out her new voice . Finally , the room was still . She felt oblivion beckon , and went to meet it , eager to escape the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she heard her father say , " A daughter for a daughter . "
