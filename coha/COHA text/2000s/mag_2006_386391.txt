. Daron Rahlves ( legs ) , Jeff McKitterick ( upper body ) , and Kent Kreitler ( core ) show you how to knock your summertime muscles into shape . It 's the sad truth : Even if you spent the last four months cycling , climbing , or surfing , you ca n't forgo ski-specific training in the weeks leading up to first chair . If you want to hammer opening day like it 's the middle of February , you have to trade in the singletrack for some hours in the gym . Not buying it ? After decades of big-mountain skiing and World Cup racing , pros like Daron Rahlves , Jeff McKitterick , and Kent Kreitler say the best way to transition from summer to ski season is to zero in on your legs , core , and upper body  --  and fine tune those areas for eight weeks before hitting the snow . To build a workout for you , we called upon Travis Weaver , a ski and snowboard fitness trainer certified by the National Academy of Sports Medicine and owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Weaver distilled our athletes ' favorite moves into one fluid regimen that demands no more than an hour of your day , five days a week . Do the program faithfully , and we promise more on-hill agility , power , speed , and control . " You ca n't get away with not going to the gym , " says Rahlves , who would put in three-hour days , five days a week prior to World Cup season . " I used to max out to complete exhaustion and blow chunks during some of my workouts . " DARON RAHLVES : LEGS Last March , Rahlves , 33 , announced his impending retirement  --  and then went on to win four World Cup events . Though he 's off the circuit now , he wo n't be disappearing any time soon . A new skiercross pro tour is on the docket , as well as freeskiing . Just like racing , both require strong but supple legs rather than jackhammer quads . " I 'm pretty thoughtful and intense about my weight-lifting routine , " says Rahlves , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other upper-leg muscles have to work together to provide strength , injury protection , and endurance . Outside , Rahlves works his legs by leaping from rock to rock on trail runs and jumping on and off his truckbed . Then he hits the gym . LEG EXERCISES THE MOVE : STABILIZED JUMP-OFF TRAINS : Glutes , hamstrings , quads , calves Stand on top of a six- to 24-inch box in a semi-squat position : Knees are bent 45 degrees . Softly jump off the box and land quietly on the floor , first on the balls of your feet , then on your entire foot . Keep your knees over your ankles , lower yourself into full squat , and stabilize . " This is not about the jump , but about a soft , controlled landing , " says Weaver . THE MOVE : LATERAL BOX JUMPS TRAINS : Glutes , hamstrings , quads , calves , core Stand next to a six- to 24-inch-high box . With feet shoulder-width apart and arms extended , squat down  --  knees stay over ankles , butt sits back  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softly on the soles of both feet ; then squat back down and stabilize yourself . Explode back and forth from the floor to the box to the floor . Continue jumping for the prescribed duration . ( See chart , page 139 . ) THE MOVE : TRIPLE BOX SQUAT JUMPS TRAINS : Glutes , hamstrings , calves Set up three six- to 24-inch-tall boxes in a row with three feet between them . Face them with your feet shoulder-width apart , chest up , and knees bent in a deep squat . Explode out of the squat to land softly  --  in a squat  --  on the first box . Jump back down , touching the ground for a split second  --  pretend the floor is on fire  --  as you bound onto the second box . Repeat to land on the third box . After jumping off the third , pause and stabilize in the squat position . Turn around and repeat . UP THE BURN : Increase the box height by four inches per set . THE MOVE : DIAGONAL LUNGE TRAINS : Glutes , adductors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold one dumbbell , up to 40 pounds , vertically with both hands in front of your pelvis . ( Beginners start without weight . ) Keep your spine straight , gaze forward , and step forward diagonally with your right foot . Bend your right knee to 90 degrees , and keep your knee in line with your ankle . Left leg is straight , dumbbell still centered . Pause , return to start , and repeat with your left foot to complete one repetition . THE MOVE : SPLIT SQUAT TRAINS : Glutes , hamstrings , quads Position yourself two to three feet in front of a Bosu ball or bench . Your left leg extends behind you with the top of your left foot on the object . Your right knee is positioned slightly behind your right ankle . Squat by bending your right knee until your right thigh is parallel to the ground ; keep your chest up and do n't allow your knee to track in front of your toes . Pause , and then push through your right heel , flexing your glute , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before switching legs . UP THE BURN : Increase weight by five-pound increments , keeping good form for the prescribed number of reps . THE EIGHT-WEEK PLAN For the next two months , you 'll strength-train Monday , Wednesday , and Friday , and work your **25;3249;TOOLONG system Tuesday and Thursday . You 're relegated to the gym for strength training and plyos , but take your cardio workouts outside . Do plyos first ( when you 're fresh ) and then run , bike , or swim , focusing on intervals , which mimic the stop-start demands of skiing . Break your cardio work into five-minute blocks . Go easy for the first two minutes , ramp up in minutes three and four , and sprint for the last minute . Do this for 30 to 40 minutes , and then cool down for five . On strength-training days , you 'll do " supersets , " which group three exercises into one set . Complete one superset , rest for 60 seconds , and continue to the next . ( See chart on page 139 for more information . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then do some core work before you start jumping . Core muscles take a lot of the load during plyos. 2 . For the first two weeks , beginners or those with a history of knee problems should do plyos on the floor or a pad  --  you 'll add boxes in week three . 3 . If you 're compromising your form , stop , catch your breath , and then finish the set . 4 . Spend 20 to 30 minutes after workouts on the bike . It 'll hasten recovery and increase flexibility . JEFF MCKITTERICK : UPPER BODY After having 13 screws and a plate drilled into his tibia following a skiing accident in 2004 , Squaw Valley freeride ambassador Jeff McKitterick , 44 , went stir crazy . " I could n't sleep , so I started challenging my upper body in the gym while I did rehab on my leg . " When the veteran big-mountain skier , who has been featured in such films as TGR 's Further and The Realm , got back on his boards , he noticed the difference his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper body makes you more comfortable throwing yourself down the hill and holds you together if you crash , " he says . UPPER-BODY EXERCISES THE MOVE : UPRIGHT ROW Trains : shoulders , abs , upper back With feet shoulder-width apart and back straight , hold either a curl bar in both hands or a dumbbell in each hand . Beginners should start with up to 25 pounds , and more advanced athletes can work up to 75 pounds . Lift elbows toward the ceiling as you pull weight directly upward ; stop when weights reach chin level . Pause ; then slowly lower the weight . THE MOVE : PULL-UPS Trains : Lats , biceps , mid-back , shoulders , pecs Using a wide overhand grip on a pull-up bar , contract your lat muscles , keeping your back as broad as possible . Pull yourself directly upward until your eyes are above the bar . " Imagine you 're pulling your elbows towards the ground , " says Weaver . Keep your body straight and still , and lower slowly to complete extension . Weak lats ? Opt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assisted pull-up machine , or a lat pull-down machine . THE MOVE : BALL PUSH-UP TRAINS : Core , pecs , triceps Assume a push-up position on the ball : toes on floor , hands on either side of the ball with fingers pointing to the ground , and feet six inches apart . Flex abs to prevent low-back strain and mid-section sag . Beginners should position the ball against a wall for additional support  --  or simply do the push-ups on the floor . Keep a downward gaze , lower your chest between your hands , pause , and return to start . UP THE BURN : Starting on the down part of the push-up , simultaneously raise your right leg in alignment with your body . As you lower , slowly return your right leg to floor . Alternate legs with each push-up . THE MOVE : STRAIGHT-ARM PULL-DOWN TRAINS : Core , Lats , triceps Kneeling on a Bosu ball , position yourself in front of a cable machine . Grab a handle in each hand . Extend your arms in front of you so they are parallel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , arms straight , and whole body still , pull your shoulder blades together and arms down until your arms are perpendicular to the floor . Pause ; then slowly return to start . No Bosu ? Do the exercise while standing on one foot . UP THE BURN : Do one arm at a time . THE MOVE : TRICEPS KICKBACK TRAINS : Triceps , core Rest your chest on the ball and your toes on floor , and then straighten your body from shoulders to heels . With a five- to 15-pound dumbbell in each hand , raise your arms above your body and bend them to 90 degrees . Keep your shoulders still and abs contracted as you extend your arms until they 're straight . Pause ; then slowly return to start . UP THE BURN : Alternate arms . MCKITTERICK 'S TIPS 1 . Work the full range of your muscles , which will help stretch them and prevent injury on the slopes . 2 . Before or after your workout , take a few minutes and hang from a pull-up bar . It 'll relax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortened or become compressed during a lifetime of skiing . 3 . Use light weights to work injured body parts . Blood-flow helps injuries heal ; heavy weight lifting before you 're ready does not . KENT KREITLER : CORE " Having a rock-solid core gives me the confidence and physical strength necessary to execute all kinds of turns and tricks , " says Kent Kreitler , 36 , whose you 've got-to-be-kidding lines helped build ( and continue to define ) the sport of big-mountain skiing . The core  --  abdominals , lower back , and obliques  --  stabilizes the body . It keeps you balanced and anchors the arms and legs as they set up turns and let you power through chowder . Core exercises The Move : Cable Chop Trains : Obliques , hips , glutes Stand next to a cable machine , both hands holding a cable handle at the height of your right shoulder . With tight abs , extended arms , and your feet planted firmly on the floor , rotate your torso to pull the cable diagonally toward your left hip . Keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reps on one side before switching sides . UP THE BURN : stand on a Bosu ball as you chop . QUICK TIP For all exercises , use enough weight so that the last four reps are difficult but you can still do them with good form . THE MOVE : COBRA WITH REVERSE FLY Trains : Core , lower back , glutes , shoulders With your feet on the floor ( or with your heels resting against a wall if you need to ) and legs straight , rest your mid-torso on a ball , arms hanging straight down from your shoulders , hands gripping five- to 10-pound weights . Contracting your lower back and keeping your gaze on the floor , raise your torso until you create a straight line from shoulders to heels and extend your arms into a T position . THE MOVE : MEDICINE-BALL ROTATION TRAINS : Obliques , core , balance Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart on a Bosu ball , holding a three- to eight-pound medicine ball in your right hand ; extend your arms to a T position . Keeping your core @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of your chest . UP THE BURN : Track the ball with your eyes as you pass it from hand to hand . Even harder ? Add a squat while passing it back and forth . THE MOVE : BALL KNEEL TRAINS : Core Stand facing the ball , and then position both hands and one knee firmly on top of it . In one fluid motion , place the other knee on top of the ball . Raise your torso , keeping your back straight , until your hips are over your knees , which should be shoulder-width apart . Hold for 30 seconds . " Your core controls your balance , " says Weaver . UP THE BURN : Engage your arms . First , extend them in front of you until they 're perpendicular to floor ; then lower them . Next , stretch them to your sides to form a T ; then lower them . Eventually add five-pound weights . QUICK TIP Use the right size ball : Use 55 cm if you 're under 5 ' ' 6 " ; 65 cm if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; 75 cm if you 're over 6 ' ' . Stare at a fixed object and flex your abs . KREITLER 'S TAKE 1 . To make the most of core workouts , do n't forget to breathe . Inhale with gravity ( lowering to the floor in a crunch or releasing the cable chop ) and exhale during exertion. 2 . Actively flex your ab muscles during the exercise . Learn to fire your abs by placing your hands on your stomach and exhaling as if you were blowing out a candle . Feel the flex , then keep it throughout the exercises . 3 . Do n't skip cardio : You ca n't see a six-pack if it 's covered in a layer of fat . This article contains a table . Please see hardcopy of magazine or PDF .
