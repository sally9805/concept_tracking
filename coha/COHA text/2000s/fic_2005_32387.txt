If the Shoe Fits By Stephanie Rowe Dorchester Publishing Stephanie Rowe Business tip for the day : if your future employment at the day job is already in peril , do n't let your boss find you passed out at your desk , drooling all over a set of loan documents . I was dreaming that I was in a meeting at the day job . I 'd fallen asleep in the conference room , and I could n't wake up . Everyone was hitting me with various office supplies , and I was trying desperately to wake up , but I could n't get myself to open my eyes , could n't find the strength to lift my head . " Paris ? " An insistent knocking . " Paris . Wake up . " I sat up quickly , blinking at the sight of my very hot boss standing in my doorway , the corners of his mouth curving in poorly hidden amusement . Damn . I 'd been dreaming that I 'd been dreaming . In actuality , I had been sleeping at my desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wiped the drool off my cheek and tried to think of a really good explanation . " I have narcolepsy . " Thad Wilkins was maybe a couple years older than me , and he took his bank career very seriously , as evidenced by the fact he was considerably higher than me on the career hierarchy at NorthEast Savings Bank . Like Will the hottie scientist , Thad did n't fit his role . He might be a banker , but there was an oozing sexuality about him that reminded me of a predatory cat.All muscle , and sinew and stealth , like he could sneak up behind me and eliminate my defenses before I had time to take a breath . Since the day he 'd taken over as my boss six months ago and introduced himself to me over coffee , there 'd been an undercurrent of something between us . Maybe that was why we 'd never gone to coffee since . He was my boss , I was his underling , I was already engaging in the occasional midnight massage with Will , and I still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I was pretty sure he felt the same way about me . Scary stuff that had no room in my life , thanks so much . But that did n't mean I was able to keep myself from leaning back in my chair and letting him wash over me when he leaned on my doorframe in that casual , cat-like way . Too bad the drool incident probably meant that he was n't entertaining the same thoughts about me . There 's something not sexy about a girl with saliva hanging off her face , you know ? " Got a minute , Paris ? " " Sure . " My heart started beating a little faster , as it always did when I was in close proximity to him . " Anything for you , Boss . " I used his title just as a little reminder to both of us . I 'd never had a boss I was attracted to before . Especially not when I was already dating someone else , though technically I was free to sleep with anyone I wanted , as was Will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsettling . On the other hand , it also made for some nice daydreams during boring staff meetings . I hopped up and cleared a stack of files off my client chair , catching a whiff of his scent as I moved past him . Thad smelled like soap . Clean , fresh , well-scrubbed . No cologne or other falsities . He was what he was , and it was enough for me . Crap . What was I thinking ? Sleep deprivation or not , it was time to get a grip . I felt my cheeks heat up and retreated back behind my laminate desk . " What 's up ? " He tugged at his bow tie ( how many guys nowadays wear bow ties ? I think Thad was the only one . A guy had to be pretty sure about himself to wear a bow tie . And trust me , it worked for him ) . " I had a meeting with my boss this morning . " " Sylvie Myers ? " At his nod , I grimaced . Since Thad had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvie , I immediately decided that it might be time to get nervous . " About what ? " Then I had a bad thought . He 'd noticed my name on the loan documents and he was going to fire me before I had a chance to come clean ? Shit , shit , shit . " The meeting was about you . " " Ah . " Great . This was going to be special . " And ? " " There 's some concern about your performance . " " My performance ? " My gut sank . It did n't just sink . It plummeted like an elevator whose cables had been cut , and smashed into my toes . This sounded way bigger than one loan application . " Are you firing me ? Just tell me now , otherwise I 'll obsess about it and I wo n't hear anything else you say . " That 's me . I was all about being direct . I hate people who ca n't lay it out the way it is . But damn , being fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to risk my job for PWJ , I had n't thought he 'd actually fire me . I could n't afford to lose my job . Really , I could n't . But could I afford to let PWJ die ? Impossible choices ... " No , no . I 'm not firing you . " He shook his head firmly . Phew . Some of the pressure in my gut eased . " But there are some issues . " Pressure back . " But I 'm not being fired ? " " No . " He gave me a half smile . " Not today , at least . " Well , at least I still had a job . That was good . I could n't afford to be unemployed . I forced myself to take a deep breath . " So , what 's wrong ? " He set a small pile of documents on my desk . " You 've had typos in six different sets of loan documents in the last two weeks , all of them important . " Ow . Not good . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yep , those were my loans . Yep , an extra zero on the loan amount probably was n't a good thing . Apparently , even the expensive Starbucks caffeine was n't enough to make up for four hours of sleep a night . I aimed for six , but it had n't been happening lately . Certainly not last night , when I 'd stayed up way too late working on a new business plan for PWJ . And I was n't drinking Starbucks anymore either . It was cheap convenient store coffee nowadays . Totally not the same thing . " You come in late . You take long lunches . You leave early , " he said . " And I 'm thinking you 're not visiting clients when you 're out of the office , are you ? " " Um ... I stay until six . " Could n't deny my tardy arrivals . Or that I had n't been off visiting potential clients . My arrival time had gotten later and later recently . I 'd get up early to work on PWJ stuff , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the job that actually paid the bills . Okay , so maybe my priorities were a little confused . Follow your dreams or be able to afford food ? Not always an easy choice . Dammit ! I 'd been working so hard at both jobs ! I 'd thought I was doing it okay . I was so tired all the time , and for what ? So I could fail at one and get fired from the other ? In case you had n't guessed , I really needed my day job . Food . Shelter . Such annoying needs that seriously limited my freedom to be fiscally irresponsible . No . Unacceptable . I was n't going to get fired . Thad peered at me over the rim of his glasses . " You 're seventy percent commission . You should be selling during the business day and doing paperwork after hours . You know that . " I pressed my lips together . I did know that . And I was also aware that my paychecks had n't been as big lately as they used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeah , that one I had already figured out . It figured the first comment my hot boss would make about my appearance was that I looked like hell . He could n't have noticed a new blouse that showed off my boobs ? Maybe he did n't feel the same sexual tension I felt . Maybe I had completely misinterpreted everything . Great . So not only was my job in jeopardy , but my fantasy lover was n't even returning the fantasy . Every girl needs a fantasy lover to make herself feel better when real life was in the shitter . No such luck for me , apparently . " What 's going on , Paris ? " He leaned forward , and the look on his face actually seemed to care . Like really care . Like any good boss would . He was n't trying to catch a glimpse down the front of my blouse at all . He never had . Maybe I needed a new fantasy lover . If he 'd stop coming into my office all the time and reminding me of how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Paris ? What 's going on ? When I first came into this department , all I heard were rave reviews about you . But I have n't seen it . Either I 'm a bad boss or something 's up with you . " Oh , nice one , Thad . Guilt me into revealing all . " It 's not you . " " Then what ? " How do you tell your boss that your professional aspirations lay elsewhere ? Was n't that the fast track toward a farewell party ? " Paris ? Do you have a response ? " A light knock sounded at the door . A respite ! Right on ! Any distraction was welcome . Gave me time to try to figure out how to save the situation before I had to commit to anything stupid . I smiled brilliantly at the admin who supported the loan department . " Dani ! Hi ! Come on in ! " Thad shot me a skeptical glance . Busted . He totally knew I was avoiding . Dani gave Thad an apologetic smile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were in here . " She looked at me . " Someone named Greg McFee is here to see you . Shall I have him come back later or will you be available soon ? " Greg ? Greg ? Greg ? My ex-husband was named Greg . I had n't heard from him in five years , since he took off in the middle of the night . He could n't be back . It could n't be that Greg McFee . Could it ? Black spots started dancing around in my office and the room began to spin , slowly at first , but picking up speed . " Paris ? You do n't look so good . " That was Thad 's voice , but it was somewhere in the distance , echoing in the vast emptiness of my brain . " Is she going to pass out ? " Dani talking now . " I do n't know . " I felt firm hands on my shoulders . " Take a deep breath . Fight it off . " Right . Fight . It . Off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut and willed myself to get control . Focused on Thad 's grip on my shoulders . On his hand rubbing my back . Oh , wait . That would mean he had three hands , seeing as how two of them were holding me up . Must be Dani who was rubbing my back . Bummer . I took a deep breath and the buzzing in my ears faded . " I think she 's going to be okay . " Thad again , only this time his voice was right next to my ear . I opened my eyes and found him standing directly in front of me , his face so close I could have planted one on him with minimal effort . I could actually feel his breath on my face . He smiled . " You going to pass out ? " You going to kiss me ? Hah . Nothing like having your ex-husband show up unexpectedly at your office to make you want to be caught in a compromising position with another man . " I 'm fine . " He lifted a skeptical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't argue . He did , however , help me sit up , his hands holding me securely . What a good boss . Plus he 'd maybe redeemed himself as my fantasy lover , coming to my rescue like that . Dani was standing next to my desk , looking worried . " Should I call an ambulance ? " How sweet was that ? I patted her wrist . " No , I 'm all right . Skipped breakfast . " She did n't look like she believed me . What was with all these suspicious people ? Just because I 'd nearly died of an anxiety attack did n't mean there was any reason to be concerned . " So , what do you want me to tell Mr. McFee ? " she asked . " Tell him I died last week and he missed the funeral . " I sat up more erectly and Thad let go of me . Sob . " Seriously ? " Before I had a chance to say yes , I was absolutely serious , Thad interrupted . " She 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dani darted out of the room before I could stop her . So I glared at Thad . " What 's up with overruling my death claim ? " " It 's a client . I do n't care if you 're feeling sick . You still have to meet with them . " I felt like sticking my tongue out at him . " He 's not a client . It 's my ex-husband . " Gawk . He definitely gawked at me . " You 've divorced ? " " Yep . Have n't seen the bastard since he left either . " I eyed my window . " Do those open ? " I could probably fit through it . I was n't as skinny as I had been when I was training for the Olympic trials , but it was a very big window . And it was only three floors up . I could survive that , could n't I ? Thad cursed under his breath . " Listen , I 'm sorry I interfered . You never talk about your personal life . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Now you do . I 'm the CEO of a financially strapped company that makes foam and I have an ex-husband . Anything else you want to know ? " " Got a boyfriend ? " " What ? " I gaped at Thad , and he looked completely shocked at his question . Awkward silence , anyone ? I should have said yes , I really should have . Or at least sort of . But I did n't .
