If it 's lucky , every company has at least a few employees like Burton Jenkins . An executive assistant at a large financial-services firm in New York City , Jenkins , 28 , is one of those unflappable , capable people who cheerfully work long hours and expect no more extra reward than the satisfaction of doing good work and having it acknowledged . If only that spirit could be inspired in an entire work force ... <P> It can be . That 's the radical idea behind Why Pride Matters More Than Money , Jon Katzenbach 's engaging new book about what motivates employees and what does n't . A former senior partner and director at McKinsey &; Co. , Katzenbach runs his own consulting firm in New York City . For this book , he has drawn on hundreds of recent interviews and his 40 years of experience in consulting . What quickly becomes clear is that workers such as Jenkins ( most names in the book are fictitious ) are n't selfless grinds ; they have simply found satisfaction in their work in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guy for everything from computer glitches to party planning , and he values the chance to earn a good living in a city he loves . Jennifer Bartholomew , 40 , who works in marketing at KFC in St. Louis , Mo. , gets a thrill from helping restaurant managers penetrate new territory . <P> Katzenbach strips back the warm fuzzies to get at the telling details . Bartholomew 's husband Eddie works for a food distributor that threatens layoffs for those who miss sales quotas , so he has little incentive to do more than meet them . At KFC , however , Jennifer is judged subjectively by her bosses on her commitment to regional restaurant managers . Higher sales often result , but numbers do n't define her . Katzenbach writes , " While money may attract and retain people , it is rarely at the heart of what motivates them to excel . " <P> Many companies try nonfinancial incentives , but clumsily . Team-building junkets ( even to St. Croix ) do n't work , nor do positive-attitude lapel buttons . Successful motivation requires careful thinking about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom line and how to tailor incentives to individual employees . After a manager in the Tampa , Fla. , office of Aetna , for example , started pizza parties tied to quality measures for rank-and-file workers , backlogs fell sharply . ( Katzenbach does note that pay is the best motivator for upper-level executives , whose potential earnings from bonuses and stock options are enormous . ) <P> A company 's culture must also work from the ground up , beginning with the frontline worker . The famously unbuttoned style of Southwest Airlines , for instance , goes hand in hand with the company 's all-important low-cost structure . In job screening , test scores and educational pedigree are secondary to a candidate 's excitement about that company 's irreverent ways . <P> The book would have been richer with more about companies at which the motivation equation is more complex . Katzenbach mentions Enron 's bonus-driven culture but does not acknowledge that employees did , for a time , enjoy the pride of working for a well-regarded firm . Might their pride have blinded them to Enron 's rotten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
