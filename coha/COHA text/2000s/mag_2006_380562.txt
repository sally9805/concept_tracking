Without much oil under its sands , Dubai is no petro powerhouse . But you ca n't beat it for being the most colorful sheikdom in the Middle East  --  or the most ambitious . What other desert land can claim one of the world 's largest indoor ski slopes , featuring fresh powder year round ? While flying in on the stylish , state-owned Emirates Airlines , you might notice the artificial islands in the shape of a palm tree or the 56-story Burj al-Arab hotel , as tall as the Eiffel Tower , built like a billowing sail . Westerners are welcome , along with their vices . Europeans in bikinis mingle on the beach with Muslim women in abayas ; alcohol flows freely at Dubai 's nightclubs and resorts . With events like the Dubai World Cup , a horse race with a record $6 million purse , Dubai draws 7 million visitors a year , along with big-name acts from Luciano Pavarotti to Tiger Woods . Its economy has nearly tripled in size , to $34.5 billion , in just a decade . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of time , " says Mohammad al-Gergawi , executive chairman of Dubai Holding , the government-run conglomerate that oversees most of the emirate 's big domestic and foreign investments . " In 10 to 15 years , we put Dubai on the map . " <P> It took some members of the U.S. Congress about a day and a half to accomplish as much notoriety for the place , such was their outrage over the latest piece of Dubai 's economic development . A state-controlled company , Dubai Ports World , which aims to be a major player in the global-shipping industry , last November agreed to pay $6.8 billion to buy a British firm , Peninsular &; Oriental Steam Navigation Co . ( P &O),; which controls terminal operations under five U.S. port authorities , including those in New York City , Baltimore and Miami . Citing security issues and a lack of information from the Bush Administration , usually free-trade Republicans like Peter King , chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee , have all but vowed to show up at the docks to stop the deal . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dry , " says King . The tussle has even offered the prospect of former President Bill Clinton , a Dubai adviser , squaring off with his spouse , New York Senator Hillary Clinton , who opposes the buyout . Geopolitics makes strange bedfellows . The deal is on hold pending a 45-day national-security review that DP World asked for in the hope of winning support and easing fears about its antiterrorism credentials . <P> The P &O; acquisition is emblematic of a Middle Eastern merchant state on the rise , one that aspires to be much more than an amusement park for jet-setters . Run since 1995 by a press-shy crown prince , Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum , who became emir this year ( Sheik Mo , to finance types ) , Dubai has established a network of holding companies , funds and corporations with more than $15 billion in overseas investments and a domestic goal of turning Dubai into a hub for everything from financial services to biotechnology . Call it Dubai Inc. , a conglomerate with Sheik Mo as CEO . " We are not that different from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head of Dubai 's Department of Economic Development and chairman of the real estate developer Emaar . " They realized their economy is too small , so they said , ' Let 's go to a broader market . ' That 's what 's happening . "
