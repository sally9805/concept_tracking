<p> Hidden three stories beneath a busy city hospital , a brightly-lit San Mateo parking lot is hardly the kind of place you 'd expect to be bustling with raw teenage energy in the wee hours of a slow Friday night . <p> But this garage , with its long , winding drive down to the subterranean parking area , plays host to a cabal of dedicated skateboarders who load up their Jeeps and beat-up pickup trucks each week with ramps , grind rails and other skate obstacles . They haul the gear to out-of-the-way spots where they can ollie and kickflip without fear of reprisal from authorities . <p> " This goes on every single weekend , " said Andy Caceres , 15 , one of the band of skateboarders who hail from San Mateo . " We usually get around 10 to 15 people to come with us , and all the good skaters around here know what we 're doing . And on some nights when we leave , we realize that no one will ever know we came . " <p> These midnight excursions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spots are being fueled by a growing disaffection among a number of San Mateo skateboarders . They 're striking out for rough-hewn spots after feeling " betrayed " when their city last fall turned its once-free and unmonitored skate park  --  a park the skaters helped build by gathering 2500 petition signatures  --  into a " boring " place with daily admission fees and full-pad safety rules . <p> " This garage is crazy because we can set up an obstacle like a ramp or a rail on each level , and then bomb all the way down from the top , " said Larry Thomas , 17 . " Even when no one 's here at night , you might get kicked out by the cops , but it 's not like we have a choice  --  you ca n't skate the skate park at night . " <p> Ryen Motzek , who has been skating for over six of his 20 years , and who helped get the park opened , said his enthusiasm for having a designated skate area in his home town faded quickly after opening day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd own , and I hoped I 'd finally get good at skating ramps , " said Motzek , who had dodged the park 's constant police patrols when he was skating without his helmet . " But it turned out to be entrapment . We do n't want to worry about cops at the skate park , but we had a greater chance of getting busted there than on the street . " <p> Sebastian Caceres , 17 , liked the park so much at first that he risked getting multiple tickets for riding there without the proper safety gear . <p> " When it opened I was stoked because we had a place to go , " said Caceres . " But I stopped going there after I got two citations for skating without a helmet  --  I did n't want to get busted again . " <p> City officials say the new rules at the city 's skate park , which currently operates in a temporary location , were implemented to stop kids from skating recklessly without helmets and safety pads , and from vandalizing and trashing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> In fact , things got so bad just eight months after opening that , last August , the city shut down the park . <p> " It was getting progressively worse and worse , " said George Musante , Senior Community Services Supervisor and the park 's official overseer . " We closed it because kids were n't wearing their helmets , and it also got to the point where our park guys were spending hours there every morning cleaning it up . Alcohol bottles , spilled soda - it was a pigsty . " <p> Still , eight weeks of skaters ' protests and appeals convinced the San Mateo Parks and Recreation Department to reopen the park at the end of last September . But the new incarnation required users to pay a $3 membership fee and daily fee of up to $6 . In addition , full-time monitors ensure skateboarders are armored in their protective gear . <p> While many of the skaters involved with the initial park opening decry the new rules , others say the regulations provide a sense of safety . <p> Cameron Alcava , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every other weekend , said he prefers the safety pad requirements . <p> " I was n't wearing pads one time ( outside the park ) , and I fell off a curb and scraped both my knees , " he said . " So I like the pads  --  I like the protection . " <p> The 8000 square foot area can accomodate 60 skaters at a time . But the masonite-covered jump ramps , quarter pipes and even the five-foot high half-pipe were only being skated by 15 kids one recent winter weekday . <p> Park officials note that , despite low daily turnouts , over 1100 skaters have signed up as members since September . However , they acknowledge that most new members are one-time users who do n't live in San Mateo . <p> Musante says the new fees cover the cost of staff and maintenance , and that the new safety rules have reduced the number of complaints from area businesses about skaters hitching rides on the backs of customer 's cars , or coming into their stores , banged-up and bloody , looking for emergency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ call from local merchants since the park reopened , " Musante said . " And the parents do n't call anymore to complain that the older guys are verbally abusing their kids . " <p> Employees of Longs Drugs across 42nd Avenue from the park said the new rules meant they were seeing less skaters trooping in with six-inch cuts on their elbows and knees seeking first aid . <p> " I was concerned when the pharmacy was busy , because , frankly , they do n't have the time to do that , " said Mark Mantani , a Longs senior manager . <p> Tom Kyriakis , the owner of an electronics shop that skaters pass on their way to the park , said putting a monitor there stopped any problems he had with skaters interfering with his business . <p> " The loitering was all day long before , " he said . " Now they might have scared off the bad elements . Kids do n't go there to hang out and cause trouble anymore because they know they ca n't . " <p> San Mateo police also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find themselves chasing speeding , helmetless skaters away from the park , where $100 tickets were given out for anyone caught not wearing the required safety pads . <p> " The kids were n't able to police themselves , and some were even cited more than once for the same violation , " said Officer Ray Herman , whose daily patrol includes the skate park . " But we 've had no problems at all since the park changed . " <p> Even with all the rave reviews from city officials , businesses and police , many skateboarders say they still feel betrayed by the change , and say there are fewer problems at the park because no one wants to go there anymore . <p> " It was a complete failure and a slap in the face , " Motzek said . " The city should have kept it closed , or just torn it down and said , Sorry . ' " <p> Even some parents are upset about the city 's new skate park policy . Janet Migliore , Thomas ' mother , said she considers the park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bad rap as drug users and lawbreakers . She noted her own son is part of a movement called Straight Edge , which promotes a drug-free lifestyle . <p> " For Larry to take a stand against things that usually ruin kids his age , I 'm the happiest parent in the world , " she said . <p> Park officials deny trying to do any harm to local skaters , and point out that they are already negotiating with state Department of Transportation to acquire a spot under the intersection at the 92 and 101 highways for a permanent park . The current site , at 42nd and El Camino Real , is set to close permanently in December . The city had promised local business owners that the park would only be there for two years . <p> " The city could have said to the skaters , ' Sorry , we 're not going to reopen the park  --  go somewhere else , ' " said Sheila Canzian , San Mateo 's Director of Parks and Recreation . " But we met with the skaters , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is better than having no park at all . " <p> Canzian said that when one of the five proposed locations for the permanent park fell through in January , some skaters may have jumped the gun by accusing the city of turning its back on them . Canzian , along with many skateboarders , was pushing for a new park location in the Shoreline area 's Tidelands Park on a currently undeveloped field . But , Canzian said , the area 's citizens advisory committees said they would n't support a park in that area . <p> " The skaters simply heard that as , The city 's not supportive of a park in San Mateo , ' " she said . " For them it was , ' If it 's not here , then it 's not going to be anywhere else . ' " <p> And despite many skaters ' concerns about being left out of the new park 's planning , Canzian said the skaters will be involved in its design from start to finish . <p> " We have not shirked our responsibility to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be involved once we get a site . " <p> But for Larry Thomas , whose " skate-park-in-a-Jeep " makes the midnight rounds every weekend in search of dangerous , exciting  --  and empty  --  San Mateo parking lots , any skate park may be antithetical to skaters ' natural push for the freedom of out-of-the-way spots . <p> " We used to skate all the time at some run-down tennis courts in Joinville , and it was such a blast , " Thomas said . " We 'd take a bus down and see all the older guys , the older crew . Kids would bring their own ramps , and we would spend all day there . <p> " It sounds strange to say it , but those abandoned tennis courts were the gem of San Mateo . " <p> WHERE TO ROLL <p> The San Mateo Skate Park is at 42nd Ave and El Camino Real . It is open 2 p.m. - dusk Wednesday-Friday , noon-dusk Saturday-Sunday. $3 one-time membership for all visitors . Additional fees range from $2-$6 . Helmet , knee and elbow pads are required @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 22 , 2000 <p> CORRECTION : A caption in the Peninsula Friday section last week misidentified a skateboarder . He is Ryan Motzek , 20 , of San Mateo.
