There was nothing like smell to make an experience whole . Claudia grabbed a cart as she headed into Central Market and inhaled . The smell of ripe fruit greeted her nose . She immediately felt warm ; there was something about the market on Saturday morning that made her feel good , something about the way the various exotic fruits blended together that made her feel calm and relaxed . Central Market had become her oasis in the midst of a hectic week . Central Market was Austin 's semi-upscale , semi-trendy supermarket . Its aisles were stocked with the hard-to-find and exotic . Nothing ordinary here . If you were looking for organic food and top-notch catering , this was the place to go . There was no rest for the weary in Claudia 's household , especially when the weary was the wannabe superwoman type . Even though she had left him at home over twenty minutes ago , Claudia knew exactly what her fianc was doing right now  --  nothing . He needed to " decompress " from his stressful week at the office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must be nice . Claudia had no time for decompression , though her week had been as stressful as most  --  she 'd closed two major deals that the office had been working on for over a year , filled in as the " snack mother " for her best friend 's kid 's class , and taken her cat to the veterinarian three times . For Claudia , it was important that everything get done , and get done well . Nothing could slip through the cracks . She liked feeling efficient , but efficiency had its price : exhaustion . " Decaf latte please , soy milk . " She scrounged in her bag for some cash . Claudia never had time to make it to the ATM , but shopping was n't complete without her coffee . Maybe a cooking class was going on too . Central Market was famous for those , and although she 'd never had the time to formally sign up , Claudia had eavesdropped on quite a few . " Okay , you know they are much more fun when they are fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ? I will take one fully loaded , with a double shot , please . " Claudia turned around and looked up into a face that was vaguely familiar , surrounded by curly , dark brown hair . His long eyelashes framed his almond-shaped eyes perfectly . She tried to place his face but could n't . Was he wearing mascara ? " Excuse me ? But caffeine is bad for you . The way you asked for it will give me wrinkles , and I do n't make enough to afford a plastic surgeon . " She sipped at her cup and grimaced . " I sincerely doubt that you have to worry about that . You take care of yourself . You are not about to wrinkle , and there are so many plastic surgeons in Austin we might as well be in L.A. I 'm sure you can find one within your budget . " He took the cup the person behind the counter handed him . " And you should try your latte with whipped cream on top . It will make your day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm Cody , I work downstairs from you , in IT  --  " " I knew you looked familiar . " Claudia placed her coffee cup on the counter and extended her hand . They must have ridden in the elevator together once or twice . " I 'm  --  " " Claudia Barrett . " Claudia was immediately overcome as his massive fingers wrapped around hers in the strongest handshake she had ever felt . " I know who you are . Everyone does now . That was a major coup you pulled off with Boeing . They were about to drop us . The whole office is talking about it . Good job . " Claudia worked for Pittsford Electronics , and Boeing was their largest customer , one usually handled with kid gloves . Their last account executive had said something to set them off , and they 'd repeatedly threatened to take their business elsewhere until Claudia had stepped in and signed them to a ten-year exclusive agreement . She 'd ended her stress-filled week as the star of the office . Claudia blushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or later . We do have the best product . " Cody stopped shaking her hand , but he did n't let go . She shook her hand free and fidgeted . The tightness of his grip had been uncomfortable . She still could not seem to recall the exact place she 'd seen Cody before . " You have a good shopping trip . You may be the only man in here . " " You might be right about that , but I love to cook so I am here all the time . I 'm used to it . " " Really ? Your wife must love that . My fianc does n't even know how to get to the kitchen . " Claudia thought about the last time Jackson had tried to cook anything . He 'd scorched one of her best pots so badly that it had set off the smoke alarm . " No wife . No girlfriend . " He shook his head . " That 's too bad about that fianc . I find cooking therapeutic . It calms me after a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Gingerly , he balanced his cup in his shopping cart . " Take care . " He paused , not trying to hide the fact that he was checking her out . " And I like those shoes . I know you did n't buy those here in Austin . " " No , no I did n't . " She glanced down at her new sandals , half frowning . " You know shoes ? These are Taryn Rose . I got them in Houston . " Claudia opened her eyes wide in recognition as her " gay-dar " perked up . Not many men would dare make a shoe comment to a woman they did n't know . Or any woman , for that matter . " I would n't say I know them . I just appreciate women who take care of their feet . " " Oh , okay , I am surprised you noticed . Men usually do n't . It was nice talking with you . " Claudia picked up her coffee and headed into the market . Central Market was set up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
