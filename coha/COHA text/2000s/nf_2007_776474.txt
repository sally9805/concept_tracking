A Speedy Death to General Washington ! // In August 1795 , at Mount Vernon , drenched by what he called a " violent Rain , " George Washington nervously paced down a garden path , elegantly covered by crushed oyster shells . // He was desperate to return to the national capital of Philadelphia , but the biblical torrents had washed out roads and bridges . Adding to his frustration , his mail had been cut off . // Back inside , as the rains pelted his red shingle roof , spinning the dove-of-peace weathervane , the President bent over his candlelit desk , dipped a quill in black ink and tensely scratched out letter after letter . He was feeling " serious anxiety " in a time of " trouble and perplexities. " // For twenty years , since the start of the Revolution , he had taken as his due the bands playing " The Hero Comes ! " and the lightstruck Americans cheering " the man who unites all hearts . " His anointment as President by the Electoral College in 1788 and 1792 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Washington was fading . Americans had learned that a secret treaty negotiated by his envoy John Jay made demands that many found humiliating . One member of Congress said the fury against " that damned treaty " was moving " like an electric velocity to every state in the Union . " // As the public tempest had swelled , some wanted Washington impeached . Cartoons showed the President being marched to a guillotine . Even in the President 's beloved Virginia , Revolutionary veterans raised glasses and cried , " A speedy Death to General Washington ! " // With the national surge of anger toward Washington , some Americans complained that he was living as luxuriously as George III , the monarch they had fought a revolution to escape . Using old forgeries , several columnists insisted that Washington had been secretly bribed during the war by British agents . // Still others charged that the President stole military credit from soldiers who had bled and died : " With what justice do you monopolize the glories of the American Revolution ? " // Reeling from the blows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " were calling him " a common pickpocket " in " such exaggerated and indecent terms as could scarcely be applied to a Nero . " // One still-friendly gazette moaned , " Washington has been classed with tyrants , and calumniated as the enemy of his country . Weep for the national character of America , for , in ingratitude to her Washington , it is sullied and debased throughout the globe ! " // President Washington had brought the national furor upon himself by trying to avert a new war with Great Britain that threatened to strangle his infant nation in its cradle . // In the spring of 1794 , the British were arming Indians and spurring them to attack Americans trying to settle the new frontier lands that would one day include Ohio and Michigan . London was reneging on its pledge , made in the peace treaty ending the Revolutionary War , to vacate royal forts in the trans-Appalachian West  --  Oswego , Niagara , Detroit , Michilimackinac. // Since Britain was at war with France , British captains seized U.S. ships trading with the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Canada , Britain 's governor in Quebec predicted a new Anglo-American war " within a year . " // Former Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson , who hated England and adored France , demanded retaliation against the British . But Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton warned the President not to plunge into a war that America could not win . // The religious Martha Washington could not abide Hamilton 's Byzantine intrigues or his infidelities to his wife , Elizabeth . When Martha adopted a tomcat , she named it " Hamilton . " // But for the President , who knew his own shortcomings , Hamilton was an endless fount of provocative ideas , tactics and language . // During his first term , Washington had told Hamilton and Jefferson that their gladiatorial clashes over foreign policy , economics and personalities were " tearing our vitals " and had to stop . // Instead , Jefferson quit in 1793 and organized an opposition . The new political chasm between Federalists and Jefferson 's Republicans killed Washington 's old dream of eternal national unity with no need for political @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urged him to send an " envoy extraordinary " to London . A new Anglo-American treaty could secure U.S. trade on the Atlantic and the Great Lakes , giving their country time to build its economy and defenses and settle its frontier . Then if America one day had to fight off Britain , it would be far better prepared . // Washington agreed , but he knew Hamilton must not be the envoy . That would inflame the Jeffersonians . Instead , at Hamilton 's suggestion , he chose the aristocratic Chief Justice , John Jay of New York . // Privately Jay warned his wife that America might well have to battle England . But in May 1794 , before sailing from lower Manhattan to London , he promised a cheering crowd he would do " everything " to " secure the blessings of peace . " Soon after Jay 's departure , the British reclaimed and fortified one of their old posts on American territory near Detroit . // Having jeopardized his prestige to talk with Britain , Washington was furious . He wrote Jay it was " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . " Every " well informed " American knew that the British were instigating " all the difficulties that we encounter with the Indians ... the murders of helpless women and innocent children . " // He noted that some wished him to turn the other cheek : " I answer NO ! ... It will be impossible to keep this country in a state of amity with G. Britain long if the Posts are not surrendered . " // Jay got the British to forgo such aggravations while they bargained . He assured Washington that Britain felt it was having a " family quarrel " with America , " and that it is Time it should be made up . " // Jay reported that , excepting the King , the British respected no one more than George Washington . With such " perfect and universal Confidence " in Washington 's " personal character , " they had taken Jay 's presence in London " as a strong Proof of your Desire to preserve Peace . " // By the start of 1795 , Washington heard rumors that Jay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispatch case never arrived . // As it turned out , after making a deal in November , Jay had sent the President two copies of the treaty documents by a British ship that was seized by the French on the Atlantic . British sailors had thrown the papers overboard to keep them from French hands . // That spring , another ship brought duplicates to Norfolk , Virginia . By stagecoach and horseback , a mud-caked , frostbitten messenger rushed them to Philadelphia , where Washington received them at the President 's House at 190 High Street . // In 1790 , when Washington and his government moved from New York City to the temporary capital of Philadelphia , there was no official mansion for the President . // Thus the great man paid three thousand dollars a year to rent the four-story red-brick house owned by Robert Morris , financier of the Revolution and Senator from Pennsylvania. * Morris graciously moved next door to accommodate his old friend . // Washington found it " the best Single house in the City " but still " inadequate " for him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but for twelve horses only . " // During renovations , which Washington financed , a house painter allegedly attacked one of the President 's housemaids , who shrieked . Face daubed with shaving cream , the half-dressed Washington was said to have kicked the painter down the stairs , crying , " I will have no woman insulted in my house ! " // The President 's servants included eight black slaves selected from the almost three hundred who lived at Mount Vernon . Knowing that Pennsylvania law freed any slave residing there for six months or more , Washington and Martha made sure that each of their slaves was quietly sent home to Virginia every five months or so . // " I wish to have it accomplished under pretext that I may deceive both them and the Public , " the General wrote a trusted aide , insisting that the ruse " be known to none but yourself and Mrs. Washington . " // Upstairs at his mansion , Washington frowned at Jay 's " Treaty of Amity , Commerce and Navigation . " He knew that if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to their old oppressor across the sea . // Most inflammatory was Article Twelve : America could trade with the West Indies , but not with large vessels . Nor could the U.S. export any products natural to those islands . // Jay 's deal would also cosset the lucrative British fur trade in the American Northwest . The U.S. would pledge never to seize British assets in America , surrendering an important potential weapon for America 's defense . // The treaty would also allow the British to keep on halting U.S. exports to France  --  and to escape paying reparations for American slaves they had carried off during the Revolutionary War . // To keep public indignation from building against the treaty before he sent it to the Senate , Washington ordered Secretary of State Edmund Randolph to keep its contents " rigidly " secret " from every person on earth "  --  even the rest of his Cabinet . // Unlike his successors , Washington took literally the Constitution 's demand that a President ask the Senate 's " advice and consent " on treaties . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate voted . // Vice President John Adams feared the pact would be political trouble . " A Battle Royal I expect at its Ratification , and snarling enough afterwards , " he wrote his wife , Abigail . " I am very much afraid of this Treaty ! ... Be very carefull , my dearest Friend , of what you say .... The Times are perilous. " // On Monday morning , June 8 , 1795 , two dozen U.S. Senators in powdered wigs and ruffled shirts sat down in Philadelphia 's Congress Hall for a special closed-door session on Jay 's Treaty . // Washington had insisted that the men in the emerald green Senate chamber discuss the treaty in absolute secrecy . // The Aurora , published in Philadelphia by Benjamin Franklin Bache , the Francophile , anti-Washington grandson of the famous Founder , howled that " the secrecy of the Senate " was an insult to " THE SOVEREIGNTY of the people . " // With no desire to pay for Bache 's " daily outrages " against decency , the President had long ago canceled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Republican Aaron Burr of New York tried to pit Southern Senators against Jay 's Treaty by demanding that Britain pay up for the " Negroes and other property " it had stolen  --  mainly from the American South . // But Southerners were far more aggrieved by Article Twelve 's threat to their exports . Alexander Hamilton , by now a private citizen in New York City , advised Washington to scrap the article in order to save the treaty in the Senate . // The President did so , and by a bare two-thirds vote along party lines , the Senate sent Jay 's Treaty to the President 's House for Washington to sign . // To Washington 's exasperation , the treaty 's contents were no longer secret . A Virginia Republican Senator who reviled it passed a copy to the French minister in Philadelphia , who gave it to Ben Bache. // Flamboyantly , the Aurora ripped the veil off what it called Jay 's " illegitimately begotten " treaty , that " imp of darkness " approved by a " secret lodge " of Senators . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which he sold up and down the Eastern Seaboard for twenty-five cents . His wife , Peggy , had no opinion about Jay 's Treaty . She simply hoped the proceeds would buy her family a new house . // Fulminating that Jay 's Treaty had " made its public entry into the Gazettes , " Washington knew that Bache 's attacks were just the start of a national onslaught . // At midnight of Independence Day 1795 , a Philadelphia throng burned a copy of the treaty and an effigy of John Jay . // Crowds in other cities followed suit . Jay mordantly joked that soon he could walk through all of the fifteen United States by night , illuminated only by the glow of all of his effigies burning . // Bitter doggerel described the President 's envoy crawling on his belly to King George : // May it please your Highness , I , John Jay // Have traveled all this mighty way .... // To show all others I surpass // In love , by kissing of your . // Girding himself for battle from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treaty an " execrable ... infamous act " by the " Anglomen of this country . " He warned , " Acquiescence under insult is not the way to escape war . " // With steam rising from Philadelphia 's gravel streets , Washington pondered whether to sign the treaty . // From New York , Hamilton wrote the President that his decision should be " simple and plain . " Except for Article Twelve , Jay 's pact was " in no way inconsistent with national honor " and would avert a ruinous war . // Then in early July , a new British insult  --  a " Provision Order " that U.S. grain ships sailing toward France be stopped , their cargo confiscated . // Edmund Randolph advised the President not to sign the treaty until Britain canceled the Provision Order . Washington asked him to so inform the British minister , George Hammond . // Hammond asked Randolph whether Britain could suspend the order long enough to relieve the President 's political problems in signing the treaty , then reinstate it . Randolph gave him no answer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington sharply told him that he should have told Hammond that the President would " never " sign the treaty unless the Provision Order was permanently revoked. // The protest was spreading . When Hamilton defended Jay 's Treaty in front of New York 's City Hall , people threw rocks , leaving his face bloody . Someone joked that the crowd had " tried to knock out Hamilton 's brains to reduce him to equality with themselves . " // In Boston Harbor , mobs set a British ship aflame . In Philadelphia , they cried , " Kick this damned treaty to hell ! " // Spearing a copy of Jay 's pact with a sharp pole , the revelers marched it to Minister Hammond 's house , burned it on his doorstep and broke his windows , with Hammond and his family cowering inside . // Thomas Jefferson had not seen the American " public pulse beat so full " on " any subject since the Declaration of Independence . " // The new Treasury Secretary , Oliver Wolcott , feared the demonstrations might signal the British that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The country rising into flame , their Minister 's house insulted by a Mob  --  their flag dragged through the Streets ... &amp; burnt .... Can they believe that we desire peace ? " // Washington found it " extremely embarrassing " for the British to " see the people of this country divided , " with such " violent opposition " to " their own government . " // He told John Adams he suspected the demonstrations had been inspired by some sinister " pre-concerted plan " to ignite an " explosion in all parts " of the fifteen states . // As the man who had sent Jay to London , the President knew that he could be immolated by the firestorm. // One Federalist gazette mourned that " to follow Washington is now to be a Tory , and to deserve tar and feathers .
