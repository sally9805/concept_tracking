WHEN THE BRITISH EXPEDITIONARY Force ( BEF ) departed for France in August 1914 , its soldiers went to battle wearing the results of lessons learned during the Anglo-Boer War . The conflict in South Africa between 1898 and 1902 had shown that much of the British army 's equipment was inadequate , and nowhere was it more apparent than in the infantryman 's accouterments . During the Boer War , " Tommy " wore the Valise Equipment ( Slade Wallace ) Pattern 1888 , consisting of a belt , pouches and cross straps of whitened buff leather-i.e. , buffalo hide . Thick and cumbersome , it was very hard to keep supple and clean . Although there had been many modifications with the pouches-for carrying the ammunition either loose or in packets-they failed to stop numerous complaints about the loss of cartridges , especially when soldiers were in the prone firing position . The main concern , however , was that weight was unevenly distributed by the Pattern 1888 arrangement , resulting in great discomfort while marching . // British infantrymen march toward the front along The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Tommies benefited from the improved load-bearing capabilities of their web gear over its leather predecessors ( Imperial War Museum ) . // In 1903 , following a royal commission , the army introduced a stopgap ensemble . Called " bandolier equipment , " it consisted of a 2 - inch- wide leather belt fitted with a brass buckle , to which were attached four leather pouches-two holding three five-cartridge chargers and two holding two chargers each-and a leather bandolier worn over the left shoulder , to the front of which were five pouches , each holding two chargers . The new chargers , or stripper clips , had been introduced with the short Lee-Enfield rifle in 1902 ; prior to its adoption , the Long Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield rifles were loaded one cartridge at a time . Although lighter and suppler than its predecessor , the bandolier equipment was superseded in 1908 by Mills-Burrowes webbing equipment . The credit for introducing webbing into military use is generally given to Captain Anson Mills . While serving in the U.S. Army during the Indian wars , he noticed how cartridges corroded in the leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loops . Finding a competent weaver , he formed a partnership and opened a factory to produce webbing of woven cotton , which remained strong , pliable and serviceable even when wet . Within a short time , he had designed a web belt complete with cartridge loops that the U.S. Army adopted in various forms , culminating in the 1910 webbing equipment set . The British soon came to appreciate the advantage in Mills ' textile webbing , and opened a company in the United Kingdom . Working with the factory , Major Arnold R. Burrowes of the Royal Irish Fusiliers tested and rejected many designs before coming up with the excellent arrangement that the British army accepted in 1908 . When correctly assembled and worn , it was comfortable and so perfectly balanced that it would stay in place even with the waist belt unbuckled . It could be put on and taken off like a coat . BASICALLY , THE Mills-Burrowes equipment consisted of a 3-inch-wide waist belt ; two 2-inch-wide diagonal body straps ; two sets of five-cartridge pouches , left and right , each pouch holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canteen and carrier ; one frog for a bayonet ; one small haversack and one large haversack or pack ; a earner for the steel spade part of an entrenching tool ; and a strap for securing the tool 's wooden handle to the bayonet scabbard . Assembled for full marching order , the large pack was carried on the back and the smaller haversack on the left , with the bayonet and entrenching tool handle strapped underneath it . The head of the entrenching tool was carried either on the right , underneath the canteen , or across the rear , protecting the wearers buttocks . The only fault found with the otherwise fine design was that the lower left-hand pouches tended to come undone when a soldier was leaning against the trench wall , particularly when taking aim . In 1915 , a strap and stud fastening was added to prevent any of the pouches from coming open accidentally . Even after the wide acceptance of the 1908 webbing , the shoulder bandolier soldiered on for nearly 40 years , mainly in British cavalry and artillery units . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as on the front , holding a total of 90 cartridges . That bandolier was also carried around the neck of the troopers horse , giving him a reserve of ammunition . A small strip at the bottom of the shoulder bandolier was meant to secure it to the waistband and prevent it from riding up . The standard British infantryman 's rifle throughout the war was the celebrated Short Magazine Lee-Enfield , or SMLE . That weapon-often criticized for its bolt having the locking lugs at the rear , as contrasted to the Mauser 's front-locking system , and the fact that the German rifle cocked on opening the bolt-nevertheless proved to be a first-class arm . It was the only rifle of World War I to have a 10-round capacity magazine , and some soldiers even put a single round in the chamber and closed the bolt over the 10 in the magazine . That could be done even if the rifle did not have a cutoff . As with modern automatic weapons , the SMLE 's magazine was detachable . The removable butt came in three lengths @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both the back and foresight had protectors , preserving the rifles accuracy through all manner of frontline abuse . The fact that the muzzle did not protrude from the nose reduced the possibility of getting dirt in the barrel when diving for cover . The SMLE 's relatively short length made it short enough for a cavalryman 's leather scabbard and long enough for the infantry . When the SMLE was first issued in 1903 , the bayonet was the double-edged 1885 Long Lee-Metford and Lee-Enfield pattern , with the pommel altered for a different method of attachment . In 1907 a new longer , single-edged bayonet was introduced , with a fuller or groove along both sides and a curved quillon guard to catch the opponent 's blade . A further modification , made in 1913 , cut off or dispensed with the curved quillon . The original SMLE was fitted with extreme or long-range sights , consisting of an aperture rear sight and a front dial sight with pointer , the top of which had a knob that was sighted through the rear aperture . Both were mounted on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the graduated front dial sight , elevations from 1,600 to 2,800 yards were possible . To simplify the weapon for faster production , these sights , together with the cutoff , were omitted in the 1916 Short Magazine Lee-Enfield Mark III . On August 5 , 1916 , the original cocking piece , which was circular with a knurled head , was replaced by a flat piece that had three finger grooves cut on each side . Renowned for its rapid bolt action , the Short Magazine Lee-Enfield was universally popular among British and Commonwealth troops throughout the war . Canadians threw away their Ross rifles in favor of the SMLE when the mud of Flanders caused those otherwise accurate weapons to become jammed . Australian " diggers " were loath to give up their SMLEs even during World War II . WHEN WAR BROKE OUT in August 1914 , the average weight that a British infantryman had to carry was about 45 pounds . As the war progressed , so did the contingencies of modern warfare-and so , unfortunately , did Tommys load . A proliferation of head wounds from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tin hat , " formally known as the Brodie Mark I , in late 1915 . The French had preceded the British in issuing their Adrian casque a little earlier . Some German Landwehr detachments had experimented with a steel skullcap fitted with a nasal guard , worn over a leather and cloth cap , in 1915 . Known as the Gaede prototype , it was withdrawn in 1916 , when the Germans standardized their Stahlhelm , or " coal shuttle " helmet , in 1916 . When the United States entered the war in April 1917 , it tested a Franco-American Dunand helmet , incorporating a visor , but ended up adopting the British pattern helmet . Various methods of camouflaging helmets were tried from time to time , the Germans even painting theirs in a mixed variety of colors , but the most popular technique involved some form of covering . The British Tommy often used burlap , generally from an old sandbag . When troops were not on the line , British headgear usually took the form of a khaki cap or tam-o ' ' - shanter , depending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sported the Glengarry early in the war , but later wore a blue Balmoral type that in turn gave way to one in khaki . English , Irish and Welsh troops wore stiff khaki caps , generally known as " cheesecutters , " which were furnished with a brown leather chinstrap and a metal badge in front . Even after removing the wire stiffener from the crown , the cap was found to be unsuitable for the field , and was replaced by a softer version , fitted with earflaps . That too was finally replaced by an even softer cap , minus the earflaps , with a pliable , stitched visor . When the Germans introduced poison gas into the conflict , it forced all combatants to add respirators to their kits . The troops ' first expedient against chlorine gas was tying urine-soaked rags over their mouths and noses . That was followed by wadding soaked in a mixture of water and boracic powder worn over the mouth and nose , with a pair of goggles to protect the eyes . Responding to an appeal in the home newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces in a couple of days . Other designs tried included the veil respirator , also known as the " Black Widow , " which gave way to the smoke or hypo helmet , a flannel bag worn over the head and tucked inside the tunic collar , fitted with a small oblong celluloid window and , later , goggles . The German introduction of phosgene gas called for greater protection , resulting in the phenol helmet , made of a coarse material and fitted with an outer valve . That was superseded by the P.H. helmet , the letters standing for the chemicals with which it was impregnated . All of those devices were uncomfortable to wear and particularly unpopular among soldiers with sensitive skin , who complained that they caused rashes . The " Tower , " or large box respirator , became the model for the final design of the war , the small box respirator . That consisted of a face piece made of mackintosh material , also fitted with goggles , below which was a short metal pipe . To the latter was attached the outlet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ filtering canister , contained in a light canvas haversack . Two added refinements were a nose clip and rubber mouthpiece , both of which helped to keep the goggles from misting up . Normally carried slung to the side , or on top of the large pack when in full marching order , the haversack was worn on the chest in the position known as the " alert " when the presence of gas was suspected . In that position the soldier was ready to slip the face piece on at a moments notice . Such were the standard items that Tommy carried into battle by 1916 , but he was often called upon to add more . Grenades , extra rifle ammunition in cotton bandoliers , Lewis machine gun magazine panniers , trench knives , spare empty sandbags and the occasional pickax all added to his load until it was not uncommon for the poor infantryman to be toting around up to 75 pounds . When troops were attacking or advancing , the equipment was modified and lightened , an arrangement known as battle order . The smaller haversack replaced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the base , to be picked up later . Variations and refinements on that basic arrangement have characterized the infantryman 's equipment into the 21st century . <p>
