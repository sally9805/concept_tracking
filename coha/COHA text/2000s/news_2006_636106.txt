<p> You 've got to cut down somewhere . m m m mmDespite rosy economic commentary from pundits , lots of Chicagoans are feeling the pinch . Skyrocketing gas prices , rising health care costs , continuing corporate cutbacks , dragging wage growth and widespread underemployment make putting food on the table harder for many people who 've been used to having plenty . <p> Reducing your grocery bills need not condemn you to a diet of rice and beans or the " murky brown-gray sludge " M.F.K. Fisher wrote of in her wartime manual , How to Cook a Wolf . It does n't mean you ca n't eat well or deliciously . It just means you have to think about it . <p> First , " Time is money " is n't just a cliche . Spending more time cooking can be the simplest way to save money on food . <p> " The minute you walk through the door of the kitchen you 're saving money , " says Beverly Mills , co-author of the Desperation Dinners columns and cookbooks . She and writing partner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Workman Publishing , $13.95 ) , a thick compendium of tips and recipes for cooking less expensively . This book 's hints rely less on convenience foods than some of the Desperation recipes . The Cheap . Fast . Good ! dishes also take slightly longer to prepare . <p> If you enjoy cooking , more time in the kitchen can create savings on your entertainment budget , too . Invite friends in to experiment with low-cost recipes over shared meals . <p> If you ca n't devote more time , a little creative planning can still cut costs . <p> Mills advocates batch cooking . " It only takes a few more minutes to brown an extra pound of ground beef , " she notes . Packaged in small quantities and frozen , it 's then ready for use in a quick meal on another night . <p> That approach works for Cynthia Chernoff of Rogers Park , who shops and shares cooking duties for a single-income household . When chicken breasts or legs go on sale , she stocks up and cooks the poultry all at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the building blocks of food , " she says . <p> A key , though , is to package and store planned-ahead food before someone wolfs it down . " I 've started doing more portion control , " Chernoff says . <p> Controlling waste is another key facet of cutting food spending . " The most expensive food is the food you do n't eat , " says Mills . <p> Giles Schnierle of Beverly , a former chef , comments that restaurants trying to control costs often put all food garbage in a bin and then go through it at the end of the day . " An awareness is born , " he says , when the staff looks at the discards . " How did that get in there ? That could have gone into the stockpot . " <p> Develop a " use it up " philosophy . When planning meals , look first at the contents of your pantry , fridge and freezer and think about creative ways to use what you have on hand . <p> Careful shopping is critical , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without doing more cooking . " Sometimes you can find the chicken already roasted cheaper than the raw chicken , " Mills points out . <p> That proved true the other day at Meijer in Rolling Meadows . The store 's rotisserie chickens were on sale for $4.50 each . After 7 p.m. , they were marked down further to $2.50 . Raw chickens of a similar size cost $1.49 per pound , or $6.32 . <p> Cutting down on the highest-priced foods can help . Think about one-pot meals rather than dishes with a hunk of meat in the center of the plate . Find cheaper alternatives for extravagant treats . <p> " Lately , we 've been making cornstarch pudding so we can have luxurious desserts without having to buy them , " says Chernoff . " It 's easy and I 've always got chocolate chips and powdered cocoa on hand . " <p> We all have a few can't-live-without-it items , but avoid buying other foods when the price is too high . Keep track of prices so you know what 's a good deal and what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents a pound , that 's it , " says Schnierle . " And I love broccoli . " <p> " The only time we buy bacon is when it 's on sale , " says Chernoff . " You have to be willing not to buy something if it 's not at a quality level or price you want . " <p> Food tends to be fresher , more abundant and tastier , as well as cheaper , when it 's in season . Locally grown foods also offer savings because they do n't have added shipping costs . <p> While farmers markets can be terrific places to find local , seasonal produce , be cautious . Although the produce may be fresher and higher quality , it can often cost more than at the store . And all those gorgeous displays of fruits and vegetables may tempt you to buy more than you need . <p> Schnierle , who spent many years as a farmers market vendor for his company , the Great American Cheese Collection , advises shoppers to go to the markets late in the day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starting to pack up , " he says . <p> Not only will there be less temptation , but farmers may be willing to deal rather than haul unsold produce home . <p> Chernoff notes that even some brick-and-mortar retailers may be willing to bargain late in the day , especially with regular customers . " They throw out stuff at night . " <p> For example , Schnierle says , it can be worth asking the butcher if less expensive cuts are available in the back . If you 're prepared to cook it in a day or so , food at the end of its shelf life can be a bargain . <p> One easy and fun way to save is to diversify your food shopping . Do n't shop more often , but alternate trips to the big chain supermarkets with trips to smaller local stores , discount stores such as Aldi , warehouse clubs such as Costco , specialty stores like Moo &; Oink , ethnic groceries , produce stores , farmers markets , thrift stores and variety stores like Target . <p> Chernoff stocks up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out what 's on sale at Walgreens . She buys commodity items at Sam 's Club , and spices , sauces and rice at Indian markets . <p> " I seize the day , " she says . She does n't have a car , so she tries to combine her shopping with other trips . " If we go to the Middle Eastern restaurant that has a deli next door , I 'm going to run in and see what 's on sale . " <p> When shopping at ethnic stores , Chernoff advises , " See what 's indigenous to that culture , the things that they cook every day and have to have cheap . " <p> Obviously , stocking up when prices are low makes sense . But stick to items you know you 'll use . It 's no savings if it languishes in your pantry or goes bad before you can use it . <p> Mills cautions that you should conserve freezer space for the most expensive items . " If you have four or five cartons of half-eaten ice cream in there , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planning helps some people save . Mills advocates a systematic approach , sitting down every week with the grocery ads and your recipe collection , clipping coupons and making lists . <p> But if you do n't have the time or inclination for elaborate planning before you go shopping , at least look at sale fliers when you get to the store . Ask yourself these questions when you put an item in your shopping cart : What am I going to use this for ? When will I cook it ? What things do I need to go with it ? " <p> Some cost savers are just common sense , says Chernoff . " I never go to the grocery store without a list . <p> " And they say , ' Do n't go to the store when you 're hungry '  --  no kidding . If I 'm hungry I buy something and eat it at the store . " <p> Here are two inexpensive but delicious recipes adapted from Cheap . Fast . Good ! plus Chernoff 's " luxurious " pudding . <p> Leah Zeldes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AND TOMATO NO-COOK SAUCE <p> MAKES 4 SERVINGS <p> " When tomatoes are at their abundant peak , " write Mills and Ross , " this is the perfect gourmet budget dish . " Not only that , it 's extremely versatile . It can be served hot , at room temperature or cold . <p> If your family does n't think it 's a meal without meat , you can add some diced Italian salami , sauteed chicken , browned and seasoned ground beef or a can of tuna .

Extra trips waste fuel and tempt you to buy more . <p> - Plan your shopping to coincide with other errands so you are n't darting all over town . <p> - Alternate trips to the big chains with shopping at other stores . <p> - Use a shopping list . Encourage family members to jot down items as they use them up , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the store . If nothing else , make a master list of household staples and carry it with you . <p> - Seek creative storage options so you can stock up on sale items . You can stash extra toilet paper under the bed , for example . <p> - Buy a freezer . Even a small chest freezer holds a lot . <p> - Give up knee-jerk brand loyalty . Give cheaper brands , sale products , house labels and generics a try . <p> - Use it up . Do n't discard small amounts of leftovers or tired produce but think of ways to make the most of them . Those few green beans might be minced to garnish tomorrow 's soup or pasta salad . A tablespoon or two of jam can be diluted for a sweet glaze on poultry or pork or to jazz up a plain cake . Bruised fruit still makes good fruit sauce ; shriveled potatoes cook and mash up fine . <p> - Really compare prices . The big box is n't always cheapest .

It 's typically fresher , tastier and cheaper . <p> - Recycle . Save glass jars to use as storage containers . Clear jars let you see what 's in them , so you 're more likely to use leftovers before they become unrecognizable furred lifeforms . <p> - Do n't give up entertaining , but pool resources with friends . If inviting guests to bring dishes to a potluck at your home makes you feel too much like an impecunious college student , organize a barbecue or picnic at a park ( no need to clean house ! ) or arrange a progressive dinner with neighbors .
