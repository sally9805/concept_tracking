Chapter One A KILLER IN WAITING , Fred Brinkley slumps in the blue-upholstered banquette on the top deck of the ferry . The November sun glares down like a big white eye as the catamaran plows the San Francisco Bay , and Fred Brinkley glares right back at the sun . A shadow falls across him , a kid 's voice asking , " Mister , could you take our picture ? " Fred shakes his head - no , no , no - anger winding him up like a watch spring , like a wire tightening around his head . He wants to smash the kid like a bug . Fred averts his eyes , sings inside his head , Ay , ay , ay , ay , Sau-sa-lito-lindo , trying to shut down the voices . He puts his hand on Bucky to comfort himself , feeling him through his blue nylon Windbreaker , but still the voices pound in his brain like a jackhammer . Loser . Dog shit . Gulls call out , screaming like children . Overhead , the sun burns through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They know what he 's done . Passengers in shorts and visors line the rails , taking pictures of Angel Island , of Alcatraz , of the Golden Gate Bridge . A sailboat flies by , mainsail double-reefed , foam flecking the rails , and Fred doubles over as the bad thing whips into his mind . He sees the boom swing . Hears the loud crack . Oh , God ! The sailboat ! Someone has topay for this ! Startling him , the ferry 's engines grind into reverse and the deck vibrates as the ferry comes into dock . Fred stands , works his way through the crowd , passing eight white tables , lines of scuffed blue chairs , his fellow ferry riders giving him the eye . He enters the open compartment at the bow , sees a mother berating her son , a boy of nine or ten with light-brown hair . " You 're driving me crazy ! " the woman shouts . Fred feels the wire snap . Someone has to pay . His right hand slips into his jacket pocket - finds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The ferry lurches as it bumps the mooring . People grab on to one another , laughing . Lines snake out from the boat , bow and aft . Fred 's eyes shoot to the woman who is still belittling her son . She 's small , wearing tan clam diggers , her breasts outlined in the soft skin of her white blouse , nipples pointing straight out . " What 's wrong with you , anyway ? " she yells over the engines ' roar . " You really piss me off , buster . " Bucky is in Fred 's hand , the Smith &; Wesson Model 10 , pulsing with a life of its own . The voice booms , Kill her . Kill her . She 's out of control ! Bucky points between the woman 's breasts . BLAM . Fred feels the jolt of the gun 's recoil , sees the woman jump back with a little hurt yelp , a red stain blooming on her white blouse . Good !
