Two of the major networks ' new hit sitcoms star black men . This would not have been news in the era of mass-market TV 10 , 20 or 30 years ago , when white and black Americans alike would expend a few brain cells following the high jinks of Fred Sanford , the Fresh Prince and Steve Urkel . But in the mid- ' 90s , as the new " netlets " UPN and the WB added African-American sitcoms to draw an audience eager to see people on TV who looked like them , the big networks went even whiter . White folks watch Friends , and black folks watch Steve Harvey , so held the new wisdom , and never their channel surfing shall meet . ( In 1996 the melanin-poor Seinfeld ranked No. 2 among white viewers and No. 89 among blacks . ) <P> ABC 's My Wife and Kids ( Wednesdays , 8 p.m . E.T. ) and Fox 's The Bernie Mac Show ( Wednesdays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) both star well-known black comics ( Damon Wayans and the eponymous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both , says My Wife co-executive producer Eric Gold , might never have aired if not for the 1999 N.A.A.C.P. protests over TV 's lack of minorities : " The diversity issue got right in the networks ' faces , and that was when both shows got their shots . " <P> The star power is obviously key to the success of the shows , but they have also taken up the mantle of traditional parenting that white sitcoms have shed . For years , TV 's white parents have been crass ( Roseanne ) , dumb ( The Simpsons ) , even abusive ( Titus ) . On My Wife and Bernie Mac , black dads don Ward Cleaver 's authority-figure sweater . Wayans ' grouchy suburban dad Michael Kyle is firm and in control  --  though , Wayans says , " a bit of a Neanderthal . " Creatively , My Wife is one of TV 's most nondescript sitcoms , from its familiar suburban-family premise to its plain-as-macaroni title , but its very blandness makes TV 's skittishness about black comedy seem all the sillier . <P> Bernie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Bernie Mac  --  takes in his nieces and nephew after his sister develops a drug problem . But his toughlove philosophy of parenting is strictly old school . " Bernie Mac does not feel it is important to be your kids ' friend , " says creator Larry Wilmore  --  a sentiment that transcends color . Mac is both thoroughly black and raceless . Its aesthetic perfectly fits its black baby boomer protagonist ( the smartly chosen sound track bursts with such soul hits as the Ohio Players ' Love Rollercoaster ) . But like My Wife , Mac rarely mentions race  --  a sharp contrast to the netlet shows , which load their scripts with in-jokes . And unlike , say , The Jeffersons , the show treats Mac 's wealth matter-of-factly , not as a setup for fish-out-of-water jokes ( rich black people ! imagine ! ) . " Bernie Mac does n't need to remind us that he 's black , " says Wilmore . " We know that already . " <P> Even some of the more Afrocentric netlet shows might get past the perception that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it by scheduling them in blocks . UPN 's Girlfriends ( Mondays , 9:30 p.m . E.T. ) has well-written black , white and biracial characters and a sophisticated take on race . Originally a salty , derivative takeoff on Sex and the City , it has matured into a perceptive look into the inner lives of four thirtyish black women . Creator Mara Brock Akil does n't buy , though , that it 's too " inside " for white viewers . " Look at Will &; Grace , " she says . " That show is so inside about gay culture , but it 's a hit . "
