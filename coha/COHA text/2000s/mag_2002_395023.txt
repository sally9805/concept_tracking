Global terrorism is changing the nature of travel , but it 's not the only factor . An aging population , new technology , and other key trends will also affect the future of tourism . Photograph Expect a rise in the popularity of all-inclusive , family-friendly vacations with safe activities for kids . savs author Tarlow. // The travel industry made great strides during the 1990s thanks to inexpensive and safe air travel , hotels that were oases of tranquility , and inexpensive gasoline . But to succeed in the twenty-first century , the industry must overcome a host of new challenges , including fears of biochemical attacks , irregular gas prices , higher airfares , long lines at airports , and additional security clearances . The March 2002 Passover massacre in Israel , which targeted a popular seaside hotel , is an example of the interconnection between tourism and terrorism as an act of political and economic war . The U.S. State Department 's travel alerts and ongoing conflicts in places like Colombia , Afghanistan , the Middle East , and sub-Saharan Africa show that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key tourism  --  oriented nations , the travel industry 's basic health is at risk . The decline in tourism to the United States after the September 11 , 2001 , attacks on the World Trade Center is another example of the new interaction between terrorism and tourism . " Total international arrivals for USA in September 2001 dropped 29% when compared with September 2000 , " notes the Travel Industry Association of America ( TIA ) . WHY TERRORISTS ATTACK TOURISM CENTERS Terrorists may seek out tourist destinations for a variety of reasons : * An attack on a tourism center is an attack on that nation 's economy . For instance , fear of flying after September 11 hurt not only the airline business , but also the local economies of air travel-dependent destinations . Another impact is a decrease in foreign currencies and investments . To illustrate the importance of foreign currency to tourism , 48.5 million international visitors spent $95 billion in the United States at the end of the twentieth century . That money helps the American tourist industry employ some 18 million people with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ highly media  --  oriented . Terrorism seeks publicity , and tourist attractions like sporting events and festivals are likely to have media already at the site . * Tourist attractions-museums , historic sites , and beautiful scenery - represent the spirit and essence of a nation . * Tourist spots provide terrorists relative anonymity . Police and security professionals rarely know the identities or motivations of visitors at sites and events . Most democratic nations pride themselves on the right to travel freely . Yet this freedom of travel has become a tool in terrorists ' hands . The twenty-first century will have to find a way to permit freedom of personal travel while still protecting people from those who would seek to harm them . Clearly , increasing security will be a must for air carriers , hotels , restaurants , and other services . Salad bars and buffets in hotel restaurants may become a thing of the past as risk managers begin to assess the possibility of terrorism and bioterrorism in their dining rooms . Security experts in the travel industry must also address the possibility of a " suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planned attack would send an infected person by airplane to another country for the purpose of becoming a human biological weapon . OTHER TOURISM TRENDS Other major forces impacting travel as the industry responds to terrorism include new technologies , the aging of society , and time pressures creating a growing demand for convenience . New technology such as electronic devices for interpersonal communication will take on far greater importance in the travel industry . Teleconferencing will save time and money , and will also allay fears of kidnapping and terrorist attacks . The trend toward teleconferencing and interactive Web conferences ( IWC ) means that what was once a major investment in sophisticated equipment will soon become an affordable option . IWC will permit people of all races and from all walks of life to meet in cyberspace and then return to their home bases in relative security . Because one 's nationality and religion are not necessarily apparent in this medium , IWC may greatly diminish fears of prejudice and terrorism . Virtual travel technology , which simulates the visual experience of various destinations , could be a major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security-or if increased security fails to allay fears of travel . Discretionary dollars that would have been spent on travel may be used for electronic equipment that promotes virtual travel . Of course , once the investment has been made for virtual travel equipment , there is an obligation to use what has been purchased . Aging populations in most developed nations will also bring about change in the travel industry . Expect the following trends : Photograph Travel for Lifelong Learning About 30 million adults have taken an educational trip to learn or improve a skill , sport , or hobby in the past three years , the Travel Industry Association of America reports . These educational travelers are more likely than total travelers to be male ( 56% ) , younger ( average age 39 years ) , a college graduate ( 49% ) , have a professional or managerial occupation ( 38% ) , have children in the household ( 51% ) , and have a higher annual household income ( $75,000 on average ) . Universities will become centers for foreign travel . They provide a relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ programs , are centers of multicultural learning , teach targeted courses for people already in the workforce , and can quickly train people in language and communications skills . - Peter Tarlow Photograph Long-Term losses for Tourism While most industries are expected to recover from the shock of September 11 , the tourism industry could suffer the most permanent job losses . The 305,000 travel industry job cuts from September 11 , 2001 , to March 31 , 2002 , account for 25% of the total cuts in this period , according to John A. Challenger , CEO of the international outplacement firm Challenger , Gray &; Christmas Inc . Though the pace of layoffs in tourism has slowed since the terrorist attacks , Challenger believes that employers in this sector will be slow to rehire , if they rehire at all . A number of smaller travel agencies have already gone out of business because of the September attacks , cuts in commissions from airlines , and more competition from Internet firms offering less expensive , direct purchase choices , Challenger notes . Travel agency jobs have declined by 21% since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many may never return to their former numbers . Airlines and airplane manufacturers may also experience permanent job loss due to falling demand for air travel , particularly foi flights of fewer than 200 miles With tight security measures making short trips a hassle for the traveling public , decreased demand for short flights may be a lasting trend . Nearly two-thirds of the tourism-related layoffs from lass September to March were among the airlines and airplane manufacturers ; the rest were in hotels , tourist destinations , airports , food companies , travel agents/services , and car rental agencies . " Travel and tourism-related job cuts are probably higher than the numbers actually show since so many small businesses-including small restaurants , souvenir shops , travel agencies , and mom-and-pop motels-are storefront operations that often close without announcement , " says Challenger . " One day the business is there and the next it is not . Perhaps only three to seven people are affected , but the numbers start to add up . " Source : John A.

Convenience will be paramount to travelers in the twenty-first century . Airport delays caused by security concerns , a lack of runways , overcrowded skies , and the hub-and  --  spoke system will make air travel less practical and more frustrating . Both business and leisure travelers will seek ways to avoid air traffic delays , resulting in a trend away from short flights . Businesspeople in particular are determining that , by the time they arrive at an airport , spend two hours in security lines , fly to a destination , and rent a car , they would have been better off taking a train or driving . Photograph Travel Forcasts * More spas and health resorts will open , and more hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Travel dealerships " that specialize in a particular product , such as a specific cruise line , will compete with traditional travel agencies . * Ecotourism will be less popular . Environmental pressure , an aging population , and fear of disease will lead to more urban vacations or camping experiences away from large populations . // The new demand for convenience also means fewer travelers will make shopping a priority : Carting shopping bags onto airplanes is no longer possible as airlines impose stricter limits on carry-on items . In addition , the global economy makes most products from throughout the world available in many shoppers ' hometowns . Though shopping is still the most popular tourist activity , according to the TIA , outdoor activities ( rated second ) or visiting museums or historic sites ( rated third ) may surpass shopping in the latter part of this decade . In a society where travel becomes dangerous and global products become locally available , the need to travel will diminish . In the same manner , the greater use of technology means that more meetings and conferences will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that have based their economic future on conferences may find themselves in very difficult financial situations . As airport lines get longer , people may get angrier , and many will find other ways to connect than through travel . To continue to grow and prosper , the industry will have to find ways to provide safe , secure , and convenient travel experiences . Otherwise , the twenty-first century may see the end of the travel boom . Photograph Sidebar FEEDBACK : Send your comments about this article to letters@wfs.org .
