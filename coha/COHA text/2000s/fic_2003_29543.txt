Chapter One Nudging one of his slaves with the toe of his boot , Bishop Freculf waited for him to bring a stool so he could dismount with the dignity of his station . He was dressed for summer hunting , his russet gonelle of heavy linen just now wrinkled , pulling out of his girdle , torn at the shoulder , and stained with the blood of deer . His femoralia were covered with tibialia over which the broad bands of his high brodequins were laced , and all were spattered with mud . His only sign of rank was his massive pectoral crucifix on a collar of crosslets , which he had wiped clean of dust and mire . He rose in his stirrups and looked at the Priora of the convent . " What was it you wanted me to see ? " he asked , his aristocratic accent giving him added authority beyond his powerful position . " I have left my escort outside . They will wait for me . " The slave put a mounting stool in place and knelt , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his saddle . Priora Iditha dropped to her knees before the Bishop . " You can not imagine , Sublime , what has been put upon us . " Bishop Freculf laid his hand on the Priora 's head . " Then you must show me , Sorra . That is why you summoned me . " He motioned her to rise , and added to his slave , " Hold my horse . And better harm should come to you than to him . " The Wendish slave nodded to show his devotion , got to his feet , and took the big roan gelding 's reins in his hands . He did not look directly at the Bishop , for that affront would earn him a beating . The convent of Santa Albegunda was a relatively small establishment on the road between Stavelot and Reims , housing 118 nuns , their 149 servants , and 175 slaves . Famous for its miraculous cures of bodily malformations , it was handsomely endowed and maintained a fisc larger than many other similar establishments . It was comprised of eleven buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an herb garden , two orchards , four fields , a vineyard , and a pond , all enclosed within its stout outer walls . The Abba , Sunifred , was the daughter of the local Potente , a petty noble called Hilduin , and as such was able to command more support from the people of the region . The Priora led the Bishop through the courtyard toward the smaller chapel , saying as she went , " We have had no guidance in this situation . We must rely on you to tell us how to proceed . " " Of course , " said Bishop Freculf , tapping his short whip against his thigh as he walked . It had been a hot afternoon that was now turning to a warm night , and he was still sweating freely . " Do you think this will take long ? " " I can not tell , " said Priora Iditha , and stepped into the narthex of the chapel . " Look for yourself . " " What am I to see ? " asked the Bishop , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the altar . " She is praying , " said the Priora , lowering her voice slightly . " Prostrate ? " The Bishop was mildly surprised . " Is she a penitent ? " " That is n't for me to say , " Priora Iditha answered . " We are in something of a quandary about her . Abba Sunifred has not been able to determine what to do about her . She has proven a difficult case , as you can understand she might . Her father-a tanner and seller of hides-brought her to us when their village priest said he could not deal with her any longer . " " Is she willful ? " Bishop Freculf asked , perplexed by this continued evasion . " Not that we can discover . Come speak to her ; determine her demeanor for yourself , " said the Priora , motioning to the Bishop to follow her . The Bishop hesitated . " Should we interrupt her praying ? " " If we wait for her to finish , we may be here well past nightfall , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for you even now , " said the Priora , who knew enough about the Bishop to be certain of his evening plans . " You have musicians and jugglers at your villa , have you not ? " Bishop Freculf smiled . " I am a most fortunate man . " " May God be thanked , " said the Priora . " I do thank Him , Sorra , every morning and every night in my prayers . " He smiled wolfishly . " Come , then . Let us see what has caused such an uproar in this holy place . " The Priora led him down the aisle , her attention on the figure lying prone with arms outstretched before the altar . " Gynethe Mehaut , " she called . " Rise . Bishop Freculf is here . " For a moment nothing happened , and then a figure materialized in the swath of a dust-colored linen stolla belted with rope . She was pale as new curds , thin to the point of gauntness , and somewhat less than average height . Her hair was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . She might have been a ten-year-old child if not for the rise of her breasts . As she looked up , Bishop Freculf gasped , for her eyes were red as garnets . " Sublime , " she said . Bishop Freculf stared at the young woman , then turned to the Priora . " This is most ... unusual . " He contemplated the young woman , assessing her oddities and trying to determine what they might portend . " Most unusual , " he added . He stroked his beard and stared at her . " Are you ill ? " " Not that I am aware of , Sublime , " said Gynethe Mehaut . " This is not the whole of it . Gynethe Mehaut , hold out your hands , " the Priora said . Turning her red eyes away , she lifted her hands , palms up , her manner suggesting distress and shame . There , against the white flesh , was blood in the center of both palms , sluggishly wet . The Bishop stared . " What have you done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " How dare you do this ? " " I have done nothing , " said Gynethe Mehaut , her voice just above a whisper . " I pray and this happens . " " How ? " he demanded . " What do you do to yourself ? " " Nothing , " she insisted . " I do nothing . I pray . " " Then why should you have hurts like that ? They are blasphemous ! " The Bishop strove to contain his growing sense of outrage . " I do n't know how I come to have the marks , Sublime , and I have prayed deeply in the hope of learning the reason for them , " Gynethe Mehaut whispered , about to hide her hands in the capacious sleeves of her stolla . " God has not revealed that to me , no matter how I supplicate . " " They began when she achieved womanhood , " said the Priora . " She bleeds , and not just woman 's blood . " He caught her hands in his own . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she murmured . " You must have , " the Bishop insisted . He glared at her , then averted his gaze , his brow knit ; he was badly shaken . " We have watched her , Sublime , " said the Priora . " She has not cut herself that we have seen , and yet she bleeds . " The Bishop shook his head vehemently . " No . No . Those wounds are only found in Christ Jesus . No other may have them . " " Unless they are inflicted as a punishment , when the hands are nailed so that sins may be expiated , " said Priora Iditha . " But this woman has not been punished . " " Perhaps she was punished before she came here , " suggested the Bishop , his indignation barely controlled . " She has been here for many months . The marks have n't changed in all that time , " said the Priora . " Tell him , Gynethe Mehaut . " " I have had them for more than five years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent here to be cured of them . I have prayed I would be cured . " Bishop Freculf shook his head . " There is something very wrong here . The prayers of the Sorrae and the water from the well should have salved your ... injuries . " His eyes narrowed . " Unless you are not a child of the Church , but are sworn to old gods or to the Devil Himself . " Gynethe Mehaut drew back in horror . " No , no , Sublime . Nothing like that . I have lived within the care of the Church all my life . I have always been faithful to Christ and the King . " " It 's true , " said Priora Iditha . " She was taken by the Sorrae at Sant ' Osmer in Rennes , just a babe . They cared for her until she was a woman , and then the Sorrae sent her back to her parents and the care of their priest . I have the account from the Abba , Serilda of Nerithe , if you wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for piety , and she gives a good account of Gynethe Mehaut . " " Indeed I do want to see this , " said Bishop Freculf . " I will examine it at once . " " It will be given to you , along with what Patre Ermold wrote about her . We have both to show you , " said Priora Iditha . " And a letter from the Bishop of Rennes , telling of his agreement in sending her here . " " And I will look at them closely , never fear , " said the Bishop . " Where is Abba Sunifred ? I would like to have a word with her . " " She is out hunting , Sublime , as I told you , " said the Priora apologetically . " I do not expect her until sunset . " " She 's with her father , no doubt , " said the Bishop . " Very well . I will see these accounts ; then , when the Abba is back , she and I must talk . " He let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told about this before now . Why did you wait so long ? " " We were praying for a cure for her , Sublime . That 's why Patre Ermold sent her here , with his blessing , the blessings of her parents , and her Bishop . Abba Sunifred said we could not stop our prayers- " " She wanted the glory for this convent , " said the Bishop . " As well she might . Santa Albegunda is a most puissant patroness . " " I am grateful that you understand , " said the Priora , turning her back on Gynethe Mehaut , who had prostrated herself before the altar once again . " Remain here . If we need you , we will summon you . " " Yes , Priora , " said Gynethe Mehaut , her voice muffled by the sleeve of her stolla . " She seems obedient , " said the Bishop as he and the Priora left Gynethe Mehaut alone in the chapel . " That she is . And devout as well . I have no doubt that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Wednesday , and attends Vigil faithfully . She keeps herself before the altar for most of the night and half of the day . She claims that she has to do this for the sins of the world . " Priora Iditha shook her head vehemently . " It is most troublesome to see her hands as they are . " " She is a woman , and as such , heir to all the sins of the flesh in this sinful world . It is not fitting that she should have the marks of Our Savior on her flesh , but that she does so to profane the wounds . What woman can have this honor ? " The Bishop entered the largest building , the one that housed the nuns and their servants . " Where are these records ? " " If you will go to the church , I will bring them to you there . Or you may remain here , Sublime . The Sorrae are preparing for the evening meal , and so it would not be fitting for you to come any deeper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subserviently enough , it was clear that she would require the Bishop to stay in the public portions of the building . " Perhaps I should await you in the courtyard , " the Bishop murmured . " The Sorrae are not to be compromised , particularly not by a Bishop . " " No , most surely not , " said the Priora with feeling . With a gesture of dismissal , Bishop Freculf returned to the courtyard , where he ordered one of the convent 's slaves to bring him a cup of wine . " Use one of those from your own kitchen , " he added . " My cup is packed in my saddlebag and I do not wish to get it out . " The slave abased herself and went to do as he ordered . Left to his own devices , Bishop Freculf drew a knife from the scabbard on his belt and began to pare his fingernails , taking care to collect all the bits when he was done so that no one could use the parings against him . He was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wine , which she held up to him as she knelt before him . He dropped the bits of his nails into the wine and took the cup from her , swirling the wine in the cup and gesturing to her to leave him . He was half-finished with the wine when Priora Iditha returned , three rolled scrolls in her hand . " Here . You may read them now , if you wish , Sublime . The Superiora would not like these reports to leave the convent , in case she may have use for them in days to come . " This was more emphatic than it was proper for a nun to be , but the Priora was used to exercising her authority and did so now . " Would the Abba allow me to take these ? " Bishop Freculf asked . He knew the answer would be yes , for Sunifred was his second cousin and was bound to help her kinsman who was also her most immediate Church authority . " No doubt she would , " said Priora Iditha . " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slaves bring you bread and cheese . It is not as fine as what you will have at your banquet , but it will be what the Sorrae are having . " It was an obvious ploy , yet it worked . " No . I do not want to wait so long , or to impose upon you . " He did not have to add that he much preferred the banquet awaiting him at his villa than the simple fare of the nuns . " As you wish , Sublime . I will have a brazier brought , to give you better light , " she said , and clapped to summon a slave . " The Bishop would like some light . " The slave pulled at her forelock and hurried away . " Do you have to beat her much ? She 's very obedient , " said the Bishop . " Not too much . She is devoted , " said the Priora . " Why would we keep a disobedient slave ? " There was a silence between them ; then the Bishop said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope the Superiora is as careful in supervising the nuns . " " With God 's Grace , " said the Priora . She prepared to leave , but she stopped . " How long will you need to read ? " " I 'll summon you when I am finished . It will not be long , " said the Bishop , and sat down on the widest bench along the wall . When the slave brought a brazier , set it near him , and lit it , he unrolled the largest scroll and scanned its contents , murmuring as he read . The Vespers bell was ringing when Bishop Freculf rolled the second scroll closed and called for a slave . " Bring the Priora , " he ordered , and paced the courtyard until Priora Iditha returned . " I have read two of these , " he told her , holding out the scrolls to her . " A most interesting account , both of them . One day I will read the third . I will consider what they say , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He put his empty cup aside . " I will tell the Abba when she returns , " said the Priora . " And we will pray for you . " Knowing he was entitled to this , the Bishop merely nodded . " I 'll address her on the matter shortly . No more than a week . " He held out his hand so that the Priora could kiss his episcopal ring . " Very good , Sublime , " said Priora Iditha , kneeling to kiss the ring , then rose . " We will guard her . " Bishop Freculf knew that she meant Gynethe Mehaut . " Do so . But bear in mind , you may have a ravening wolf in your midst . Keep her close , and do not hesitate to confine her if she requires it . It would not be prudent to have such a one as she walking abroad . " " We will take care of her , Sublime , " said the Priora , moving away from the Bishop to answer the bell 's summons to prayer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
