Taming the Scotsman Chapter One It took a lot of nerve to face the devil in his lair . Or in the case of Eleanor ingen Alexander , it just took a lot of desperation . Desperation that hung in her heart and throat , choking her with its urgency . If the devil refused to help her ... Well , she 'd walk herself to England alone then . No one would sway her from this course . No one . Not her father , not her mother . Not even " the devil " himself . As she neared the cave at the top of the mountain , her courage faltered . Could a man really live in a cave ? That was the rumor , but until now she 'd assumed it to be nothing more than a myth made up by men who were too afraid of Ewan MacAllister to face him . After all , the MacAllisters were the most respected and feared men in all of Scotland . They were also said to be the richest . Surely such men , unlike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of refinement . Would n't they ? Yet as she looked about the barren mountain-top , she saw nothing even remotely resembling a cabin or home . Ewan MacAllister really was the barbarian of legend . " That 's just as well , " she said , lifting the hem of her dark blue skirt to step around a cluster of rocks . She might be dreaming in her heart of a refined gentleman of courtly virtues to win her hand , but a barbarian was what she needed at the moment . A barbarian with a mighty big sword . From all she 'd heard , Ewan MacAllister was just what her adventure called for . At the top of the craggy slope , she realized that the " cave " had a wooden door that was mostly concealed by brush and dirt . Apparently Ewan had no desire for visitors . Any other time , she would take the hint and respect his wishes , but right now , she could n't afford to . Her need for freedom was much greater than his for solitude . Nora started @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small cleared area . What an interesting place he had here . The cave looked out onto the loch far below where the sunlight glistened on the water . It was a breathtaking view . Calm . Serene . No wonder the man had chosen it . Surely a true barbarian would n't be able to appreciate something as refined and beautiful as this view . It gave her hope . Moving back to the door , she knocked on it . No one answered . " Hello ? " she called , knocking louder . " Is anyone there ? " Still no answer . Undaunted , she tried the door . The latch clicked , and it opened easily enough . Inside she found an even more interesting abode . The floor was covered with plush rugs and rushes . The stone walls even held a few tapestries to blot the dampness . There was a strangely designed fireplace that had a bent flume and chim-ney to go out the side of the mountain instead of up through the top . A table and two chairs were set before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bed at the rear . Large and lush , it looked as if it belonged in some fine noble 's castle , not stuck out in the midst of the woods , on top of a mountain . Ewan MacAllister was a strange man indeed . Why would he choose such a place and then bring with him the comforts of home ? And it was then she heard the snarling sound of the beast himself . It was a brief , eerie kind of snort , terrifying and deep . Her heart skipped , then pounded as she realized it came from the large bed . All she could see from her position by the door was a dark lump she now assumed was a man . He was asleep ? It was high afternoon , too early to be abed for the night and too late to be abed from the morning . A nap perhaps ? Or was he ill ? Please , not sickness . She needed him to be hale and hearty for this venture . A sick barbarian would n't do at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lump . " Lord Ewan , might I have a word with you ? " Only the snore answered her . Well , bother this . Here she 'd come all this way expecting to face an ogre and all she got was a sleeping cub . Where was the giant of legend who terrified everyone who spoke his name ? She needed that fearsome beast . Aye , she needed him . Stiffening her spine , she approached the bed , then faltered again as she saw him clearly for the first time in the dim light of the cave . He lay on his side , spread out across the mattress as naked as the day he 'd entered the world . Not once in her life had Nora ever beheld a naked man , but she was quite certain no other man looked as fine and handsome as this one . Especially not while he slept . His long , muscled limbs seemed to go on forever . He was so large in stature and muscle that the bed barely accommodated him , and if he were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his arms and legs would be left dangling over the edges . His black hair was shaggy and ill-trimmed , and draped over a face so manly and handsome that it stole her breath to look at him . He held at least a week 's growth of beard on his face . The rugged , untamed look only made him seem even more desirable . Fierce . Barbaric . His tanned flesh was stretched tight over muscles that were rock-hard and well defined . Aye , this was a fine man to make her heart race and her body warm . Truly , he had no equal . Before she could stop herself , she realized her gaze was traveling down to the center of that delectably male body to his ...
