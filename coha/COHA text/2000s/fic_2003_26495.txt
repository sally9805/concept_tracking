Kill the Competition Chapter One Belinda Hennessey opened the shower door and leaned out , hair dripping , her soapy ear piqued for the voice of the predominant man in her life  --  although granted , the fact that she 'd never even met the guy was a tad on the pathetic side . From the clock radio on the crowded vanity , a sexy , Southern-bred accent reeled into the room over the whir of helicopter blades . " Traffic is jammin ' up on I-85 south-bound below the I-285 junction due to a three-car accident in the rightmost lane . Southbound Peachtree Industrial and Buford Highway are feelin ' the effect , so my advice is to hop over to Georgia 400 while it 's still a speed limit ride , which wo n't be for long . " He whistled low . " If you 're comin ' into Atlanta from the northeast this mornin ' , I hope you 're not runnin ' late . I 'm Talkin ' Tom Trainer for the MIXX 100 FM traffic report . " Oh , that voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swore softly . She yanked a towel around her , made wet tracks to the bedroom , and let the ho-hum carpet soak up most of the water dripping down her legs . With one hand she ran the towel over the rest of her while flipping through hangers in her closet . Her shoulder muscles still twinged from an " iron arms " session in the gym  --  a degrading experience she had allowed herself to be talked into in lieu of lunch a couple of days ago . According to a fitness report on the radio , now that she had entered her thirties , she was losing muscle mass at an alarming rate . Yes indeed , it was a fine time to be single again . When her fingers touched a knee-length gray jersey dress , she pulled out the garment and tossed it onto the unmade bed . An indignant yowl sounded from beneath the leopard print comforter , and Downey 's black head appeared . " Sorry , " Belinda offered . " I 'm running late . " Downey blinked . The feline 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her the cat , her ex , Vince Whittaker . She hesitated to refer to Vince as her ex-husband , since their marriage had lasted a mere six hours . Downey was the best thing to come out of that train wreck , despite her current slit-eyed disdain . " I know  --  I should n't be late on my first day driving the car pool . " The shower was her downfall . This town house was the first place she 'd ever lived in that had an adequate hot water heater , so she leaned under the spray every morning until her skin was just short of a good scald . The indulgence was heavenly , but the trade-off was hell . With the agility of a hurdler , she leapt into underwear , panty hose , dress , jacket , and pumps , then gave her unremarkable auburn hair a one-minute blast from a blow dryer . A touch of translucent powder , mascara , and lip-stick would have to pass for makeup ; her cheeks were still pink enough from the shower to skip the blush . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she knew she 'd be plagued with thoughts of dropping dead before the day ended and her mother 's tsk , tsk when her parents came to gather her personal effects . " I knew this move to Atlanta so soon after the you-know-what was too much for her , Franklin . " ( Her mother refused to make direct references to the reneged wedding . ) " Look , she did n't even make her bed  --  I heard on the Today show that untidiness is a sure sign of depression . " Little did her mother know , she did n't have time to indulge in a good cathartic bout of depression . Her new job was consuming every waking hour , and for that , she was eternally grateful ... because the urge to wallow was so close to the surface . Especially today . Since opening her eyes to stare at the white fluted globe covering the light-bulb in her bedroom ceiling ( over the past two months she 'd grown to hate that globe ) , she had n't been able to shake the sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of sorts had been on her wedding day . Yilk . She dropped an earring twice , poked it in as she jogged down the stairs to the foyer , then dashed into the kitchen to grab an instant breakfast drink from the fridge . Her briefcase sat open on the table , surrounded by accounting spreadsheets . She shoved the papers inside and slammed down the lid , catching her thumb and bruising the nail . Gritting back a foul word , she checked Downey 's water , knuckled the cat 's regal pouting head , and managed to slide behind the wheel of her clover green Honda Civic just after 6:30 A.M. , only five minutes late . But getting started a measly five minutes late in the Atlanta commute could mean the difference between arriving in time to prepare for her 8:30 A.M. meeting , and tearing into the meeting already in progress with murmured apologies to her scowling boss , Margo . And " tardy " was n't the opinion she wanted the woman to take into her first performance evaluation , which was mere days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furniture Company in the hopes of getting a raise that would put her on the same earning level of her previous financial position in Cincinnati . She thought of the sliding balance in her savings account and sighed . Everything in Atlanta was more expensive than it was in Cincinnati . Carpooling was only one of the cost-saving measures she 'd adopted since her impromptu move . If she could 've gotten a refund on a gently worn wedding gown , she would own a couch ...
