To get the AIDS epidemic under control , you need brilliant leaders like Dr. Fauci . But if you want to get rid of HIV , the virus that causes AIDS  --  not just harness it but completely eradicate it from infected individuals  --  you want Dr. David Ho . <P> I was part of the team that named Ho TIME 's Man of the Year in 1996 , and having followed his work in the years since , I suspect that he is a worthy match for the wily virus . <P> The goal of eradicating HIV with drug therapy is surprisingly controversial . Most physicians have abandoned it ; they have found HIV too adept at either hiding from the drugs or mutating to resist them . <P> Ho , however , is still championing the idea that sufficiently potent antivirals , given in the right combination at the right time , may eliminate HIV and  --  just possibly  --  even cure AIDS . <P> His focus today is the pesky reservoir of virus that camouflages itself from both the body 's immune system and any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Ho has reduced HIV 's assault on the immune system to a relatively simple math problem . If the virus in the reservoir replicates at a certain rate , and if various drugs slow down this replication at measurable rates , then a drug regimen that outpaces HIV 's reproduction could , in theory , permanently shut the virus down . <P> Working with a four-drug combination that is 20% more potent than today 's cocktails , Ho has already shown that it is possible to shrink the reservoir faster than with current regimens . Virus , beware ! <P>  --  By Alice Park
