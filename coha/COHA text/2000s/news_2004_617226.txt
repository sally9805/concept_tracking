<p> Officer R. Thomas Jr . works out of one of Atlanta 's toughest police precincts . He puts his life on the line for a little more than $34,000 a year . <p> Each week the single parent of a 12-year-old son also works security on the side at a theater or city housing project , plus other jobs he can pick up . The extra money means the difference between living hand-to-mouth and affording the extras . <p> " I could survive without them , but they sure help , " the 29-year-old officer said of the jobs . " It helps with my son 's karate and stuff like that . " <p> Moonlighting officers such as Thomas are everywhere in Atlanta . <p> They direct traffic outside nightclubs and restaurants , or patrol neighborhoods . But the extra jobs also raise concerns over fatigue and possible conflicts of interest . <p> An audit of Atlanta Police Department operations  --  conducted by the consulting firm Linder &; Associates  --  found about 92 percent of 1,000 officers surveyed said they must moonlight to help pay bills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work " to rest up " for lucrative off-duty gigs that can pay as much as $30 an hour . The starting annual salary for an Atlanta cop is about $33,000 , or roughly between $15 and $16 an hour . <p> The chief also noted that officers can become so loyal to private employers that they may forget their public duty to enforce the law . <p> Within a few weeks , Pennington hopes to unveil tighter controls on moonlighting to combat problems the extra jobs make for a police force already stretched thin . He has declined to discuss the steps he will take . <p> Part of the chief 's campaign is to raise salaries  --  by 40 percent over several years  --  to undermine the moonlighting by most of his nearly 1,500 officers . <p> " If you pay your officers properly , you wo n't have that fatigue factor coming into the Police Department , " the chief said . " They wo n't work extra jobs . The only reason they work them is because they do n't make enough money . " <p> Atlanta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for officers , and also hiring more officers . Police received a 2 percent increase this year , with another 2 percent hike scheduled for July . To meet Franklin 's goal of a 40 percent increase by 2007 , the police officers ' salaries would have to increase by 12 percent a year . <p> Atlanta pay ranks low <p> According to PolicePay.net , a Web site dedicated to police pay and benefits , Atlanta ranks 122nd in police pay among forces in the nation 's 200 largest cities when cost-of-living adjustments are made . The city ranks 156th out of 200 if not adjusted for cost of living . <p> Retired Detective Woodrow Tripp remembers the extra jobs and the fatigue . " Extra jobs really do diminish your work , " said Tripp , who left the force in 1999 . " One time , I was in a police car at a railroad crossing about 5:30 in the morning , and the next thing I remember was some guy knocking on my window to wake me up at 7 o'clock in the morning . I literally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> But Richard Straut , president of the Atlanta chapter of the Police Benevolent Association , doubts the exhaustion is so great that it undermines performance . <p> " If they are fatigued , it is up to their supervisors to notice it , but I 've never had an officer I 've worked with to be tired because of an extra job , " Straut said . " An extra job , for the most part , is never as strenuous as being on the beat . " <p> Some officers want to slash moonlighting to spend more time with their families or to enjoy life . Others said the jobs nearly double their income and they would keep working them regardless of their police salaries . <p> " If we got overtime , I would n't work them so much , " said Thomas , the patrolman . " We get comp time , and I ca n't go to the guy who holds the mortgage and say , ' Here is my comp time . ' " <p> Last year , Pennington boosted the permissible moonlighting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ help compensate officers for low pay . The chief said many already worked at least that amount of hours . <p> He also has tried four-day , 10-hour shifts with three days off in Zone 1 in northwest Atlanta . That makes it easier for officers to do off-duty police work to earn extra pay . <p> Moonlighting puts officers in places on-duty officers might not be . Straut said one off-duty officer makes some of the department 's best drug arrests while keeping an eye on the parking lot of a late-night eatery . <p> " They 're filling in the holes that the beat officers ca n't cover , " Straut said . <p> The Midtown Alliance formed Midtown Blue , a security force of about 40 off-duty officers , to patrol its business district . <p> Susan Mendheim , president of the Midtown Alliance , said Midtown Blue was started in 2000 because the department could n't provide enough security for the rapidly growing area . She said the security force coordinates with the police . <p> " We created an unusual partnership , and I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to say the new chief hopes he puts us out of business because he thinks the city should be providing the security . " <p> Conflicts of interest ? <p> But moonlighting also raises concerns that officers may be more beholden to a private employer paying for off-duty security than to their duty to protecting everyone , said Brandon Hornsby , a former Clayton County prosecutor . <p> " Your greatest concern is if the objectivity of the officer is compromised , " Hornsby said . " To me that is the trickiest obstacle to overcome . " <p> Straut , president of the Police Benevolent Association , said misplaced loyalty is n't a problem . " Some places think because they pay you , they own you , and they 'll learn quick they do n't because you can leave an extra job anytime you want . " <p> The Atlanta police saw how embarrassing the jobs could be last year after local TV station WAGA reported how the department 's motorcycle division was cashing in on the NBA All-Star Game by escorting celebrities through some of Atlanta 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be on the clock , working for the public . <p> After months of investigation , Pennington has recommended discipline for the 56 officers involved  --  ranging from a written reprimand or a few days ' suspension to dismissal for Lt. Tim Ewing , a supervisor in Zone 3 . Pennington also is recommending a 30-day suspension for Maj. Stanley Savage , who , unless he retires , is to be demoted to lieutenant . <p> Maj. Pearlene Williams , Pennington 's chief of staff , was recommended for a four-day suspension . <p> " There were a lot of people in town that weekend  --  NBA players , music producers , rap artists , " said Sgt. Scott Kreher , president of local 623 International Brotherhood of Police Officers . " They hire police officers for private security and bodyguards . They hire us for parties . " <p> The officers and brass still may appeal the suspensions departmentally and to the civil service review board . <p> Other law enforcement agencies already restrict moonlighting . The Georgia State Patrol 's starting pay of $28,000 a year is lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs troopers can work to avoid conflicts of interest , said Wayne Yancey , legal director for the state Department of Public Safety . <p> For instance , the APD and the Fulton County Sheriff 's Department allow their officers to work off duty outside bars and nightclubs . The State Patrol does n't allow it because the trooper would get paid by an establishment that sends potentially drunken drivers onto the road . <p> " He would have to arrest everyone leaving the club who had a couple drinks , " Yancey said . " Otherwise , he would be violating his oath of office , and you should be fired for violating your oath of office . " <p> Potential pitfalls <p> The Georgia Bureau of Investigation , where the starting salary is $34,500 , generally prohibits its agents from working as security guards , security consultants or in any way that capitalizes on their law enforcement backgrounds , said agency spokeswoman Vicki Metz . It ensures an agent wo n't work for someone who comes under investigation . <p> Moonlighting also can spark trouble within the Police Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he retired in 1999 , the Atlanta force was a network of extra jobs that was brokered largely by several majors and ranking officers . Well-connected street cops also became powerful within the department by controlling extra jobs and hiring their superiors . <p> One of Pennington 's first reforms was to prohibit officers from supervising their on-duty supervisors on extra jobs . <p> Pennington said he has put an end to the job syndicates controlled by top brass to end conflicts of interest . One lieutenant  --  recommended for firing  --  handled permit applications for events on city streets and property while running a side business to provide officers to work the events , Pennington said . <p> " That 's not going to happen again , " said Pennington .
