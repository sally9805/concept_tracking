First Day It was while he was eating breakfast that Charles Douglas glanced at his newspaper and saw the date . He took another bite of toast and looked again and put the paper down . " Oh , my God , " he said . Alice , his wife , startled , looked up . " What ? " " The date . Look at it ! September fourteenth . " " So ? " Alice said . " The first day of school ! " " Say that again , " she said . " The first day of school , you know , summer vacation 's over , everyone back , the old faces , the old pals . " Alice studied him carefully , for he was beginning to rise . " Explain that . " " It is the first day , is n't it , " he said . " What 's that got to do with us ? " she said . " We do n't have family , we do n't know any teachers , we do n't even have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but ... " Charlie said , picking up the newspaper again , his voice gone strange . " I promised . " " Promised ? Who ? " " The old gang , " he said . " Years ago . What time is it ? " " Seven-thirty . " " We 'd better hurry then , " he said , " or we 'll miss it . " " I 'll get you more coffee . Take it easy . My God , you look terrible . " " But I just remembered . " He watched her pour his cup full . " I promised . Ross Simpson , Jack Smith , Gordon Haines . We took almost a blood oath . Said we 'd meet again , the first day of school , fifty years after graduation . " His wife sat back and let go of the coffeepot . " This all has to do with the first day of school , 1938 ? " " Yeah , ' 38 . " " And you stood around with Ross and Jack and what 's his --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We knew we were going out in the world and might not meet again for years , or never , but we took a solemn oath , no matter what , we 'd all remember and come back , across the world if we had to , to meet out in front of the school by the flagpole , 1988 . " " You all promised that ? " " Solemn promise , yeah . And here I am sitting here talking when I should be getting the hell out the door . " " Charlie , " Alice said , " you realize that your old school is forty miles away . " " Thirty . " " Thirty . And you 're going to drive over there and --  " " Get there before noon , sure . " " Do you know how this sounds , Charlie ? " " Nuts , " he said , slowly . " Go ahead , say it . " " And what if you get there and nobody else shows ? " " What do you mean ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're the only damn fool who 's crazy enough to believe --  " He cut in . " They promised ! " " But that was a lifetime ago ! " " They promised ! " " What if in the meantime they changed their minds , or justforgot ? " " They would n't forget . " " Why not ? " " Because they were my best pals , best friends forever , no one ever had friends like that . " " Ohmigod , " she said . " You 're so sad , so naive . " " Is that what I am ? Look , if I remember , why not them ? " " Because you 're a special loony case ! " " Thanks a lot . " " Well , it 's true , is n't it ? Look at your office upstairs , all those Lionel trains , Mr. Machines , stuffed toys , movie posters . " " And ? " " Look at your files , full of letters from 1960 , 1950 , 1940 , you ca n't throw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To you , yes . But do you really think those friends , or strangers , have saved your letters , the way you 've saved theirs ? " " I write great letters . " " Darn right . But call up some of those correspondents , ask for some of your old letters back . How many do you think will return ? " He was silent . " Zilch , " she said . " No use using language like that , " he said . " Is ' zilch ' a swear-word ? " " The way you say it , yes . " " Charlie ! " " Do n't ' Charlie ' me ! " " How about the thirtieth anniversary of your drama club group where you ran hoping to see some bubblehead Sally or something or other , and she did n't remember , did n't know who you were ? " " Keep it up , keep it up , " he said . " Oh , God , " she said . " I do n't mean to rain on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I 've got a thick skin . " " Yes ? You talk bull elephants and go hunt dragonflies . " He was on his feet . With each of her comments he got taller . " Here goes the great hunter , " he said . " Yes , " she exhaled , exhausted . " There you go , Charlie . " " I 'm at the door , " he said . She stared at him . " I 'm gone . " And the door shut . My God , he thought , this is like New Year 's Eve . He hit the gas hard , then released it , and hit it again , and let it slow , depending on the beehive filling his head . Or it 's like Halloween , late , the fun over , and everyone going home , he thought . Which ? So he moved along at an even pace , constantly glancing at his watch . There was enough time , sure , plenty of time , but he had to be there by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondered . Was Alice right ? A chase for the wild goose , a trip to nowhere for nothing ? Why was it so damned important ? After all , who were those pals , now unknown , and what had they been up to ? No letters , no phone calls , no face-to-face collisions by pure accident , no obituaries . That last , scratch that ! Hit the accelerator , lighten up ! Lord , he thought , I can hardly wait . He laughed out loud . When was the last time you said that ? When you were a kid , could hardly wait , had a list of hard-to-wait-for things . Christmas , my God , was always a billion miles off . Easter ? Half a million . Halloween ? Dear sweet Halloween , pumpkins , running , yelling , rapping windows , ringing doorbells , and the mask , cardboard smelling hot with breath over your face . All Hallows ! The best . But a lifetime away . And July Fourth with great expectations , trying to be first out of bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
