Are all Law &; Orders created equal ? Ken Tucker gathers evidence and renders verdicts on the three prime-time crime busters. // L &O; 10 PM WEDNESDAYS NBC L &O:; Special Victims Unit 10 PM FRIDAYS NBC L &O:; Criminal Intent 9 PM SUNDAYS NBC LOTS OF PEOPLE LOOK at the new Law ds Order : Criminal Intent , its creepy nephew , Law &; Order : Special Victims Unit , and its goaty old daddy , Law &; Order , and view them the way their producer , Dick Wolf , does : as a franchise of interrelated cop shows . Wolf has learned that slapping the " Law &; Order " label on any of his crime stoppers ' textbooks boosts prestige and profits . ( It helped , for instance , when he advertised the 1998 Chris Noth TV movie Exiled as " a Law &; Order movie " ; on the other hand , Mann and Machine , his L &O;  --  free 1992 bomb about a cop and a curvy cop  --  robot , probably would n't have survived even if he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off Wolf 's labels , however , and these Law &; Orders become very different creations in various stages of development or regression . Take the original series , now in its 12th season . On the police-procedural side , partners Jerry Orbach and Jesse L. Martin have n't established any appreciable rapport ; it 's only when a patented " ripped from the headlines " script is juicy ( such as Nov. 28 's clever sampling of the P. Diddy-Jennifer Lopez nightclub-shooting incident ) that the series sparks . These days , Sam Waterston is looking even more hangdog than usual now that his prosecutin ' partner is Elisabeth Rohm-whose acting style , as revealed in two previous series , Bull and Angel , consists primarily of talking in a monotone and staring blankly , as if trying to hypnotize her colleagues and the audience with the message " I 'm a young blonde .... Nothing else matters .... You will liiiiike me .... " Sorry , Lizzie , your character 's pearls-and-cashmere  --  sweater wardrobe is a nice touch , but your WASP ice-princess act does n't cut it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other extreme , take a glance at Criminal Intent , where Vincent D'Onofrio has borrowed time from his film career to do some of the most flamboyant detective work since David Suchet twirled mustache wax as PBS ' Hercule Poirot . CI is the L &O; spin-off that shows you the crime first , then lets you watch how the heroes suss it all out . D'Onofrio , as a " special case squad " solver , reveals the workings of his character 's mind by physicalizing everything . He does n't just interrogate someone , he bends his long , wide , Gumby body around a suspect , who becomes additionally unnerved when D'Onofrio waggles a frankfurter-long finger in his face and asks cutting yet smiley-faced questions . D'Onofrio is so eccentrically entertaining , even his costar Kathryn Erbe seems fascinated . This does n't do much for her role-she must have 75 percent less dialogue per episode than he does-but it jibes with the subtle range she showed on HBO 's Oz and proves her professional generosity . Although snowy owl Jamey Sheridan is similarly nonplussed and underutilized as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a silky-voiced prosecuting attorney who makes defendants wither in the face of his elegantly reasoned cross-examinations . Add tight plotting , and CI is the L &O; of the year . Dead last , on the other hand , is Special Victims Unit , which in its third season still portrays Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay as the most naive , bleeding-heart molester busters in America . The only time I perk up is when officer Ice-T slams a perv against a wall or when Stephanie March unscissors her legs from under the prosecuting attorney 's table to demolish a creep on the stand . Rather than continue to expand the L &O; brand ( I fear that somewhere , a crack team of writers is beavering away at the pilot of Law &; Order : Shoplifter Shift ) , these shows should be condensed . On that Nov. 28 L &O,; Dianne Wiest 's DA suggested that CI 's Vance " second  --  chair " a case in place of Rohm ; Waterston demurred . I object : Pair Waterston with Vance as the legal team ; add CI 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L &O's; S. Epatha Merkerson as their boss , and presto-the overlord-producer would have one crackerjack series . He could even indulge himself a little and call it Law &; Order : Wolf Pack . Law &; Order : B Law &; Order Special Victims Unit : C- Law &; Order : Criminal Intent : B+ <p>
