<p> KEVIN TOWERS looks forward to the date in July that separates contenders from losers . <p> " I 'd like to be adding in July rather than subtracting as we 've done the last five years , " San Diego Padres General Manager Towers said of the July 31 deadline for making trades without waivers . <p> The inclination is to say " the surprising San Diego Padres , " but the good start that has had them flirting with first place in the National League West is not so surprising . Before the season , the Padres had the look of a contender . <p> They have obviously undergone plastic surgery because their 64-98 record was the league 's worst last season and their .613 winning percentage ( 19-12 ) would translate to 99 victories for this season . On the other hand , how could they play badly in their new stadium , Petco Park ? <p> Other teams have done it , of course . Milwaukee , Pittsburgh , Cincinnati and Detroit have squandered the opportunity that their new parks provided . Cleveland set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new park , and San Francisco and Seattle followed . <p> " We were hoping we 'd time it right where we 'd have a quality product on the field with the new park , " Towers said . " Looking at the division , we felt by adding a couple new pieces , we 'd have a chance to win the division . If we had n't won the division in ' 98 , we probably would n't have got Proposition C passed . We hope if we can do it this year there will be a carry-over effect . " <p> Towers actually began the infusion of talent last August when he acquired right fielder Brian Giles from Pittsburgh . Then during the off-season he traded for catcher Ramon Hernandez and outfielder Terrence Long , signed center fielder Jay Payton and pitchers David Wells , Ismael Valdez and Akinori Otsuka as free agents and decided that the rookie shortstop Khalil Greene was ready to play regularly in the major leagues . It did not hurt that closer Trevor Hoffman was recovered from shoulder surgery and ready to pitch full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games for San Diego last September in his second professional season , created the most interesting story of the spring for the Padres . <p> " We brought in Rey Ordonez to compete for the job at short , " Manager Bruce Bochy said . " We were n't 100 percent convinced Greene was ready , and we did n't want to rush him . " <p> But Ordonez did not complete the competition , leaving the Padres ' camp before the end of spring training . <p> " He was playing very , very well for us , but he looked at his competition and saw it the way we did , " Towers said . " He figured for the first time in his career he was n't going to win the job , so rather than get released , he thought the best way to handle it was to jump ship and leave . " <p> While Greene is in the Padres ' starting lineup every day and is hitting .279 , Ordonez , once a future star for the Mets , is on the restricted list and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of belonging in the major leagues even though this is his first full year , " Bochy said of Greene . " He 's a very levelheaded kid and even keeled . He does n't get down over errors or bad at-bats . He has the talent obviously and the makeup . He 's done more than we expected to this point . " <p> Greene , 24 , teamed with second baseman Mark Loretta to help the Padres turn 37 double plays , second most in the league . Loretta , meanwhile , has been the team 's most potent force , hitting .336 in leading an offense that has not been particularly explosive . <p> The Padres have hit only 19 home runs , the fewest in the league , and have the 13th-lowest slugging percentage . Giles , considered the biggest offensive threat , started the season slowly but has picked up in the last 10 days or so . He is the team leader in home runs with five and is tied with Loretta in runs batted in with 18 . Loretta has hit four home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bochy said . " I said this guy can flat-out hit . What this means is he 's going to get a lot of hits from now on . " But Bochy acknowledged : " Our offense has n't clicked . We 're where we are because of our pitching . " <p> The pitching staff has the league 's second-lowest earned run average , 3.48 . <p> " Having David Wells at top of the rotation gives us a proven starter which we have n't had since ' 98 , when we had Kevin Brown , " Towers said . <p> Towers also credited Hernandez with helping the staff . <p> " Although he 's not swinging the bat , he has made a big difference behind the plate , " Tower said . " He 's done with our staff pretty much what he did in Oakland . " <p> Otsuka , a Japanese import to whom the Padres won rights with a $300,000 bid , has been another big help to the staff . He became the setup reliever when Rod Beck left camp ( he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1.06 E.R.A. in 16 relief appearances . <p> The Padres have been no more than two and a half games from the division lead except for four days and have been no more than one game behind the past 10 days . They have played the role of contender with a $54 million payroll , the division 's lowest . <p> " We feel the new ballpark has helped , " Towers said . " Having 40,000 each night inspires the players . " <p> Lamb Hits It Big <p> Mike Lamb , who but for the Alex Rodriguez trade might have been the Yankees ' third baseman this season , has struck it hitting rich in Houston . <p> Traded by the Yankees to the Astros before the start of the season , Lamb has played part time for Houston , although he is getting more playing time than expected because the anticipated everyday third baseman , Morgan Ensberg , has not hit well . <p> In 16 games before last night 's game , Lamb was hitting .364 and had a .591 slugging percentage . With 44 at-bats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 runs , compared with no home runs and 9 runs batted in in 67 at-bats for Ensberg , who was hitting .224 with a .299 slugging percentage . <p> Lamb was even outhitting and outproducing Rodriguez , who had a .265 batting average , a .469 slugging percentage and 12 R.B.I. in 29 games and 113 at-bats . <p> Bedeviled Devil Rays <p> The Tampa Bay Devil Rays were going to be a better team this season , they , and particularly their manager , Lou Piniella , said . By winning five of their first nine games , the Devil Rays looked as if they would be better . But then the team that has not won 70 games in any of its six seasons lost 15 of its next 19 games , prompting the suspicion that they were the same old inept Devil Rays . <p> With a 9-19 record before last night 's game , the Devil Rays were playing at a pace that would gain them 52 victories for the season . The lowest victory total of their shabby existence is 55 , achieved in 2002 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ switch leagues and either need time to adjust or simply never adjust , Jim Thome has not missed a step in his seven months in the National League after having spent his first 11 years in the majors in the American League . <p> Last season , his first with Philadelphia , he led the National League with 47 home runs and was third with 131 R.B.I. Entering last night 's game , he had hit 10 home runs and knocked in 16 runs while raising his batting average 64 points , to .330 from .266 . <p> " Jimmy is one of the premier power hitters in the game , " said Mike Hargrove , Thome 's manager in Cleveland for most of the time he was there . " It does n't surprise me what he 's done in the National League . I do n't think he gets credit , as Manny Ramirez did here , for being a pure hitter . " <p> Thome does not have Ramirez 's smooth swing , Hargrove said , adding : " He has that big , powerful swing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the plate and he has power to all parts of the field . I do n't think there 's a ballpark that can hold Jimmy . " <p> Zaun Blows Through Windy City <p> No one could blame Gregg Zaun if he did not want to leave Chicago last week . He hit a home run in the first game of Toronto 's four-game series with the White Sox , then collected seven hits in the last two games . Research by the Elias Sports Bureau showed that Zaun had never had more than six hits in two consecutive games . <p> " That was probably the best three games I 've ever had in my career , " Zaun , 33 , a career backup catcher playing for his eighth team in 10 major league seasons , said . <p> Zaun was in spring training with Montreal and was released at his request , then signed with the Blue Jays . Besides playing baseball , he runs the Gregg Zaun Charitable Foundation , raising money to find a cure for Parkinson 's disease , which afflicted his mother . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com Khalil Greene , San Diego 's rookie shortstop , is batting .279 .
