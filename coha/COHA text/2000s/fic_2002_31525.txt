Worlds away , on the planet Earth in the area known as Alaska , Captain Jean-Luc Picard rose from the table at which he sat , and for a moment , gazed beyond the people gathered before him at his magnificent surroundings : the Denali mountain range , snow-capped against a blue sky . The open-air pavilion was heated to a comfortable temperature , but on occasion , Picard drew in a breath of cold , pristine oxygen tinged with evergreen . The natural beauty only added to the poignancy of the moment : to gather himself , Picard concentrated on the discomfort generated by his white-dress jacket , the white tunic beneath fitted tightly at the neck , and kept his expression resolute , even stern . " Duty , " he intoned , to the officers at the bride and groom 's table with him . To his right sat Beverly ; to his left , Will Riker and Deanna Troi , flanked by Geordi , Data , and Worf . In front of the large , central table were dozens of smaller ones , occupied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's life is filled with solemn duty . I have commanded men in battle . I have negotiated peace treaties between implacable enemies . I have represented the Federation in first contact with twenty-seven alien species . But none of this compares to my solemn duty as ... " He paused for effect . " Best man . " From their center seats at the table , Will and Deanna laughed along with the rest of the guests  --  all except Data , who watched the ritual with avid curiosity . Deanna 's skin seemed to radiate the precise color of her gown  --  iridescent pale rose , gleaming like a newfound pearl . Quite a bit of skin there was , too , with the low-cut , sleeveless bodice , but her legs were covered by the sweeping skirt . One shoulder bore a corsage of cabbage roses ; a cascade of roses swirled about the skirt from waist to hem . A pink pearl , Picard thought , amidst a sea of white and gray uniforms ; all officers other than the captain wore gray tunics beneath their white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his mood was a mixture of joy and melancholy . " Now , I know that on an occasion such as this it is expected that I be gracious and fulsome with praise on the wonders of this blessed union ... But have you two considered what you 're doing to me ? Of course you 're happy ! But what about my needs ? ! This is all a damned inconven-ience ... " He continued despite the crowd 's laughter . " While you 're happily settling in on the Titan , I 'll have to train my new first officer . You all know him . He 's a steely sort of fellow who knows every word of every paragraph of every regulation by heart ; a stern martinet who will never , ever , allow me to go on away missions . " He glanced at the golden-faced android , Data , who looked up at him with those peculiarly guileless eyes . " That is the regulation , sir , " Data said earnestly . " Starfleet Code section twelve , paragraph four  --  " " Data @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sir ? " " Shut up . " More laughter came from the crowd , especially Deanna , whose dark hair was swept up into a graceful chignon . Picard turned his sights on her and affected his best curmudgeonly tone . " Then there 's the matter of my new counselor , " he said . " No doubt they 'll assign me some soft-spoken , willowy thing who 'll probe into my darkest psyche as she nods her head and coos sympathetically . Is n't that right , Deanna ? " The broad grin disappeared from Deanna 's face ; instead , she conjured a wide-eyed , strikingly concerned expression and cooed  --  sympathetically , of course . Beverly , who had served as matron of honor , leaned toward her laughingly and clapped . " I notice Doctor Crusher laughing along with the rest of you , " Picard continued . " As most of you know , the doctor will also soon be leaving the Enterprise , to assume command of Starfleet Medical . " He spread his hands in mock supplication . " Again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you considered what you 're doing to me ? I 'll probably get some old battle-axe of a doctor who 'll tell me to eat my vegetables and put me on report if I do n't show up for my physical on time . " " It 'll serve you right , " Beverly called back spiritedly . Picard sighed and regarded Will and Deanna again . " Really , it 's not too late to reconsider ... " And when they both , grinning , shook their heads , he added , " No ? Very well then . " At last , he surrendered his sarcastic tone , raised his glass , and smiled affectionately at the two . " Will Riker , " he said . " You have been my trusted right arm for fifteen years , you have helped keep my course true and steady . " He paused to gaze at the bride . " Deanna Troi , you have been my conscience and guide , you have helped me to recognize the best parts of myself . " To both he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wish you clear horizons ... My friends , make it so . " Picard and the rest of those gathered upended their glasses . A band had begun to play , and the guests to mingle ; Picard began to make his way toward Riker and Crusher , but in midstride he paused once again to take in the **30;0;TOOLONG sight of the Denali range , framed at its base by stands of tall evergreens . The mountains , white set against glistening white , formed a jagged horizon against the clear Earth-blue sky . They appeared permanent , eternal : but in spring , Picard knew , their collective face would change ; great patches of white would give way to dark earth and dark greenery , giving a dappled light-and-shadow effect . The more things change , the more they stay the same , his brother Robert had always said , but Picard saw no validity in the statement  --  especially not on this day . Things were changing , quite radically in fact , and he failed to see how his life would ever be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than on the day they first met , something less of a mystery , but certainly no less beautiful , with her red-gold hair that seemed a reflection of her warm personality . His maudlin thought must have affected his expression , for she picked up on his feelings at once and teased , " Sort of like losing a son and gaining an empath , is n't it ? " Picard grimaced sourly at her . " You 're being a big help . " She put a hand lightly on the crook of his elbow and said playfully into his ear , " If you start tearing up I promise to beam you out . Level one medical emergency . " He had to smile at that . As the two of them made their way through the crowd toward Will and Deanna , young Wesley Crusher  --  surprisingly mature-looking in a Starfleet lieutenant 's uniform  --  crossed their path . Wesley grinned broadly . " Mom ! " Then , with a more formal air as he straightened his shoulders , added : " Captain . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's good to see you back in uniform . " " Suits him , does n't it ? " Beverly said . She was suddenly incandescent with pride ; Picard tried to imagine what it would have been like to raise a child , then finally see him one day grown and in uniform , and felt the stirrings of wistful jealousy . There were many paths he had chosen not to take in his life  --  children included  --  and Beverly 's proximity served to remind him of other lost opportunities . Nevertheless , he returned Wesley 's grin . " Are you looking forward to serving on the Titan ? " Lieutenant Crusher 's words tumbled out with the enthusiasm of youth . " Very much . I have the night duty shift in engineering , we have a double-refracting warp core matrix with twin inter-mix chambers that ... " He stopped abruptly , his attention seized by the appearance of a young woman who waved in his direction . " Oh , excuse me . See you later , Mom . " At once he was off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile and gently shake his head at the fleeting attention span of youth ; had he ever really been that young ? Beverly 's smile was a bit more rueful . Once again , they headed for Troi and Riker. *** Nearby , Engineer Geordi La Forge sat at the bar nursing a glass of synthehol while talking with Guinan . Like most of his crewmates , he was in a state of near-shock : Troi and Riker had been an item years before they worked together on the Enterprise , and for their several years as crewmates , they had remained good friends , nothing more . ( Although , of course , LaForge had always known Will Riker was still carrying feelings for Deanna . ) Then the courtship began anew  --  but the notion that the couple might actually make their relationship more permanent  --  well , it just seemed like one of those things crew members liked to speculate about , but which would never happen , rather like Captain Picard suddenly professing love for Dr. Crusher . La Forge shook his head , laughing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Ever-serene and self-confident , Guinan leaned forward to prop her elbows against the bar . " What makes you so sure he popped the question ? " " Counselor Troi ? " Geordi set down his flute and raised his eyebrows . " You got ta be kidding . " He had always thought of Commander Riker being the one to pursue Troi , of Riker having to convince Troi to love him  --  but perhaps he , Geordi , had always thought of things that way because he was male , and it always seemed to him that he had to work to earn a female 's affection . Or did the insecurity work both ways ? " You have to keep an eye on us quiet , soulful types , " Guinan said mysteriously , her lips curving upward in the small **32;32;TOOLONG . Her answer gave Geordi a thought , and that thought made him grin . " You ever think about getting married again ? " Guinan looked past him , at the Alaskan skyline , her voice trailing . " Maybe ... " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I always say , why buy the Denubian seacow when you can get the milk for free ? " Geordi barely snickered , then picked up his glass ; as he did , the Klingon Worf sat heavily , with a slight groan , on the stool beside him . The normally bronze skin beneath Worf 's eyes was ashen , his thick eyebrows knit together beneath his bony forehead , which was furrowed even more deeply than usual . The Klingon had continued to let his hair grow , and now wore it in a simple braid down his back . " Romulan ale should be illegal , " Worf rasped . He referred , of course , to Riker 's bachelor party , held the night before : the Klingon had been less than circumspect in his imbibing . Geordi dared not smile , but he did allow himself the comment , " It is . " " Then it should be more illegal , " Worf said with conviction . He groaned  --  loudly this time  --  and set his head down on the table while Geordi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crusher had at last made their way to Will Riker and Deanna Troi . Troi smiled warmly at Picard with her ebony eyes , and touched his forearm with her hand . " It was a lovely toast . " " It was from the heart , " Picard said honestly . " And you need n't worry , " Deanna added . " I 'll brief your new counselor on everything she needs to know . " " The hell you will , " the captain replied with gruff humor . " You already know too much about me . Now you promised there are no speeches during the ceremony on Betazed . " Will and Deanna shared a bemused look . Should I remind him ? Will 's expression asked , and Deanna 's said , Go ahead . " No , no speeches , " Riker said , failing entirely to hide the impishness in his eyes . " No clothes , either . " Picard gave him a sharp look  --  apparently he 'd assumed that non-Betazoid guests were exempt from this traditional marital ritual  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his new wife laughed at Picard 's reaction . Before Picard could come up with a witty reply , the band stopped playing ; at the sound of Data 's voice , all turned to face the bandstand . " Ladies and gentlemen and invited transgendered species ... In my study of Terran and Betazoid conjugal rites I have discovered it is traditional to present the ' happy couple ' with a gift . Given Commander Riker 's affection for archaic musical forms I have elected to present the following as my gift in honor of their conjugation . " Will shot Deanna an amused glance . Conjugation ? Data began to recite a verse ; gradually , the band joined in . " Never saw the sun Shining so bright , Never saw things Going so right , Noticing the days Hurrying by-When you 're in love , My how they fly ! " The band launched full voice into a style that Picard recognized as twentieth-century Earth swing . Data began to sing : " Blue skies Smiling at me , Nothing but blue skies Do I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long . " The rhythm was irresistible  --  to all except Worf , who raised his head from the table and groaned loudly over the music , " Ugghhh ... Irving Berlin . " And with a great thump , his head struck the table again . Picard turned away to hide his smile ; he had left Will 's bachelor party early , lest his presence inhibit any of the celebrating , but by that time , Mr. Worf had already imbibed enough Romulan ale to account for his current condition . Beside the captain , Will was tapping his foot to the beat ; the groom gave his bride an anxious little glance , like a child asking permission to go join the fun . Deanna smiled at him indulgently . " All right , go ahead . " Riker ran up onto the bandstand , where his trombone rested off to the side ; he grabbed it and began playing . Picard turned to Deanna and proffered a white-sleeved arm . " May I have this dance ? " She grinned . " With pleasure , Captain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Beverly Crusher took pity on Worf 's misery and decided to distract him from it . The Klingon could very well have come to sickbay and asked for treatment which would have gotten rid of his apparent hangover  --  but perhaps Worf would have considered such help a sign of weakness . Besides , Crusher had n't seen him in some time and would not see him again for  --  well , at the very least , years , and quite possibly forever . She had teased Jean-Luc Picard about becoming emotional at this wedding reception  --  but she may as well have been talking to herself . It had been hard enough when Wesley left the Enterprise years ago , but now she was leaving ; leaving Jean-Luc and Will and Deanna all at once , and the sense of loss was staggering . There had been a time , when she had first been offered the position of head of Starfleet Medical , that she had actually considered turning it down . Her life was on the Enterprise , she had told herself ; she had made deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered them as much her family as her own son . But the more she considered the offer from Starfleet , the more she realized she could not turn it down . She was a seasoned space traveler , but there had been times , especially in the past few years , when her longing for home  --  for Earth  --  became overwhelming . Soon it became persistent  --  and then the current head of Medical announced his retirement . Beverly applied for the position , with Picard 's recommendation to back her . The process of applying , of the interviews , sparked a deep determination within her . She had spent the past fifteen years as a doctor aboard a starship  --  indeed , as the chief medical officer of the Fleet 's most prominent , prestigious starship . But the good that she could do aboard the Enterprise was far different from the far-reaching type of good she could do at Starfleet Medical ... and she was ready for a difference , for a new challenge . Yet now , walking across the dance floor toward Worf , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people ? She chided herself for being overly sentimental . She had a promotion , a new job and new friends to make . Now was the time for celebrating , not grieving . It was beautiful here , with the glittery snowy mountains and the deep blue sky , the good friends , and the music ... As Beverly walked toward Worf , she passed a smiling Geordi La Forge , who was leading a beautiful African woman in a brilliant red dress to the dance floor . Apparently they knew each other more than well  --  that was something she was going to have to Deanna about , to get the ship 's latest buzz . Beverly walked up behind the stool where the Klingon sat , slumped facedown on the table , and said in the loudest , most determinedly cheerful voice she could muster , " Commander Worf . Do Klingons swing ? " " I am unwell , " he muttered into the table . " Do n't worry , I 'm a doctor . " With all her strength , she took hold of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and onto his feet . He staggered slightly as she drew him onto the floor , among the gliding bodies , and as he attempted to mimic her movements , it was clear he had little familiarity with the style of dance known as swing . Even so , he managed admirably , taking her fine-boned pale hand in his great dark one with a light touch . " I 'm so glad you made it back to the Enterprise before I left , " she called over the din of the music . To her , dance came naturally ; her bones were long and fine , her muscles limber and blessed with that mystery known as a sense of rhythm . She could scarcely have resisted dragging the Klingon onto the floor even if he 'd been unconscious . Worf 's pained expression eased slightly ; it was the closest he would come to acknowledging mutual affection . To those unfamiliar with Klingons , he would have seemed ferocious , with the great jutting browbone above narrowed eyes and jagged teeth ; to Beverly he looked precious . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diplomat . " An understatement if ever there was one . She managed not to laugh aloud at the thought , but instead twisted her lips wryly and shrugged went dancing past them ; Beverly looked at them both , and at Worf , and thought : I must remember every little detail of this moment , of this time . I must remember ... As she moved amidst the swirling bodies , with the backdrop of the Alaskan skyline , the moment seemed to her at once timeless and fleeting , a celebration of the brevity of life against the eternal snow-clad mountains . It seemed to her that she had been on the Enterprise , friend and fellow crew member to these people , for all of her life  --  yet now that she was leaving them , it seemed the experience had been all too short , that her moments with them had been too few . Beverly let her gaze focus on those she loved around her : on Worf , on Data singing on the stage , at the trombone-wielding Will Riker , like Deanna radiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... Yet in the midst of a longing that verged on grief , Beverly could not hold back a smile . Later that night , in his quarters aboard the Enterprise , Picard gingerly withdrew a bottle from his temperature- and humidity-controlled wine storage unit . He had to half-kneel to do so , and the gesture seemed appropriate , in light of the value  --  not just monetarily , but historically and emotionally  --  of the liquid inside . He held the bottle up to the light : its contents were the deep color of garnet , and the glass , plain breakable glass which was no longer used to house such fine wine , glinted jewel-like . He rose , the glass cool in his hands , and stepped forward into the outer area , where Data sat at the table , gently turning the captain 's Ressikan flute in his hands  --  studying it , digesting it , head slightly cocked . The android 's expression seemed entirely neutral ... and yet , Picard thought , Data 's amber eyes somehow managed to convey a sense of wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slightly , carefully , with the wine , cheered to have someone to share it with who would truly appreciate the experience . " I 've been saving this , " he said heartily . " Chateau Picard 2267 ... Batten down the hatches . " Deliberately , he began to uncork the bottle ; Data looked up with the same expression of placid yet somehow voracious curiosity and listened intently as Picard continued . " They say a vintner 's history is in every glass . The soil he came from . His past as well as his hopes for the future ... " As the cork slipped past the lip of the bottle , a heavenly aroma followed : cassis , cherry , grape , and herb and rich earth . Picard 's vintner 's nose knew at once the ratio of sugar to acid was perfect , the wine neither too young nor too old , but exactly in its prime . Set on the table were two wine glasses ; Picard filled each one-quarter full , then slipped his fingers beneath the bowl of one , supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed it to Data . Data held it awkwardly by the stem , but corrected himself at once when he saw that Picard held his own glass with all of his fingers supporting the bowl . Red wine should be gently warmed by the heat of the body . Picard smiled affectionately as he lifted his glass . " So ... To the future . " " To the future , " Data echoed . Through the wine and the crystal , Picard watched his soon-to-be first officer imitate his every move : Take a small sip . Let the liquid rest a moment on the tongue , enjoy the burst of different flavors there , savor the ever-changing aftertaste . At last release the breath , in a satisfied , delighted , " Ah ... " Picard regarded the android with amused affection . " Sir , " Data said solemnly as he lowered his glass , " I noticed an interesting confluence of emotion at the wedding . I am familiar with the human concept of tears through laughter and its inverse , laughter through tears , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both pleasure and sadness simultaneously . " " I understand why it would seem confusing , " Picard replied . To some , perhaps , Data 's ingenuous yet perplexing questions might be cause for irritation , yet the captain had always been grateful for them ; they served to help him crystallize his own feelings , to make what was often unconscious conscious . " Certain human rituals  --  like weddings , birthdays , or funerals  --  evoke strong and very complex emotions because they mark important transitions in our lives . " Data tilted his head every so slightly , a gesture that always accompanied his attempt to fathom humankind . " They denote the passage of time . " " More than that , " Picard elaborated . " In a way , they make us aware of our mortality . These occasions give us an opportunity to think about where we 've been and where we 're going . " The sense of melancholy he 'd felt during the wedding reception threatened to settle upon him again . " And you were particularly aware of this feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to assume command of the Titan ? " Picard nodded , his focus shifting to a point beyond Data , beyond the physical limits of his quarters , to a place in the future . " Will and Deanna joining the Titan ... Dr. Crusher going to Starfleet Medical ... " " And this makes you ' sad ' ? " Data emphasized the word in his effort to define it . Picard drew in a breath and with it , shifted his attention from what would be to what was . He smiled wistfully at the android . " Well ... I suppose it does a bit . I 'm very happy for them , of course , but I 'm going to miss them . The ship will seem ... incomplete without them . " Data gave a short nod , as if satisfied that he was finally able to understand this complex mix of emotion . " That is because you have a familiarity with them . You can predict specific reactions and behavior and are comfortable in that knowledge . " " Yes , " Picard admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well . They 've made important choices ; choices that mean life will be different from now on . They 're going to have great challenges ahead of them . New worlds to conquer ... " He paused to take another sip of wine , to relish the product of his past , and that of his forebears , before glancing at the Ressikan flute resting near Data . " Seeing Will and Deanna today made me think about some of the choices I 've made in my own life , " he said , and thought of the moment he 'd stood beside Beverly at the reception and watched the light that had entered her eyes when she 'd looked at her son . " Devoting myself to Starfleet ... Not marrying or having children ... All the choices that led me here . " Data remained silent a moment before at last saying slowly : " The choices I made have led me here as well . This is the only home I have ever known . I can not foresee a reason for leaving . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the captain warned lightly . " Before too long you 'll be offered a command of your own . " Data glanced at him sharply ; Picard marveled at the realization that such a notion had never occurred to the android . " If I were , " Data countered , " I believe my memory engrams would sense the absence of your specific reactions and behavior . I would ' miss you . ' " Touched , Picard smiled and lifted his own glass . " Now , you make a toast . " Data raised his glass . " To ... " He hesitated , for a moment at a loss  --  then added confidently , " ... new worlds . " " New worlds , " Picard echoed . They both put the glasses to their lips and drank .
