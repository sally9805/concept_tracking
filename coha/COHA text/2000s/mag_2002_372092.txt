The first time figure skater Sarah Hughes came face-to-face with Michelle Kwan , they were n't on the ice , but they might have been , for all the care that went into choreographing the meeting , at least on Hughes ' part . Hughes had learned that Kwan , her idol , was competing near Hughes ' home on New York 's Long Island and would be dining at a local restaurant . Hughes could n't let the opportunity pass and persuaded her older brothers and sister to eat with her at the same establishment . " I just wanted to go and eat at the same restaurant as Michelle , at the same time she did , " she says . <P> A mere four-year Olympic cycle later , Hughes is still maneuvering for meetings with Kwan , but now it 's on the medals podium . As part of the deeply talented U.S. women 's figure-skating team heading to Salt Lake City , Hughes will be facing off with Kwan and Sasha Cohen for Olympic gold in what promises to be the most intense battle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the strongest U.S. contingent since Kristi Yamaguchi , Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya Harding last stirred hope for a medals sweep in 1992 . Yamaguchi and Kerrigan delivered , winning gold and bronze , respectively , while Harding finished fourth . " With all the girls skating so well and peaking at the right time , it certainly makes sense to talk about sweeping again this year , " says Yamaguchi . <P> This being figure skating , do n't count on a team effort to knock off the competition , which this year comes mainly from Russia . You can resurface a rink with the frostiness that elite skaters reserve for one another . Hughes , 16 , makes it clear that despite Kwan 's once revered status , the six-time national champ is " just another competitor " now . The equally aggressive Cohen , 17 , announced her intention to risk everything by trying to become the first woman to land a quadruple jump in competition . <P> Kwan added another chapter to her epic eight-year quest for Olympic gold when she shed her longtime coach Frank Carroll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after winning the national championships in Los Angeles four weeks ago , she is still the one to beat . Cohen edged Hughes for second in that event , surprising the crowd with a polished , sophisticated performance , confirming that this will be a three-way race . <P> If Kwan is the ice legend of her time and Cohen is the mesmerizing but mercurial rising star , then Hughes is the well-disciplined champion in training . Her ascent to Olympic contender in the past three years could n't have been more methodical if it had been planned ; each year she has bettered her rankings at both the national and the world championships . She covers the rink with more speed than Kwan and spins and jumps with more explosive energy . While Cohen does have the edge over Hughes in emotive prowess , Hughes is the more consistent skater . <P> And although she has yet to obtain a driver 's license , the New Yorker has proved herself a deft navigator of the skating circuit . She is a crafty competitor with enough international experience to know  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She bested both Kwan and Russian star Irina Slutskaya at an international competition in November , becoming the first U.S. skater to beat Kwan since Tara Lipinski did it at the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano , Japan .
