One <br> <p> THE WORST WEEK of my life began like any other late summer week in Miami , stifling hot . The August steam rose from the Everglades and wrapped itself around the city with a vengeance . No ocean breeze or inland gust seemed strong enough to break its stranglehold . The steam became our second skin , a filmy , salty gauze impossible to wash off . I could n't imagine being one of those plastic types who , despite the 95-degree swelter , insisted on her usual Miami corporate-level quantities of makeup  --  the SPF , the primer , the base , the bronzer , the inner eye highlighter , the lip plumping gloss , all intended to create that " fresh from the beach " glow . To me , the thought of slipping into a business suit seemed punishing enough without the added torture of having to fabricate evidence of a nonexistent trip to the beach . Besides , who needs makeup when you can get second-degree sunburn from walking the dog for fifteen minutes ? <p> I fool myself into thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , nothing deflects the kind of heat I 'm talking about . But I wear white anyway because I like what it says about you . It says you 're gutsy . It takes nerve to wear a narrow white skirt cut a few inches above the knee and a crisp white shirt unbuttoned to that exact place where your breasts just begin to rise from your ivory lace balconette . That 's my no-fail outfit , the one I wear when I have a monumental deal I need to close pronto . <p> That 's what I wore on the day I took the old cowboy out to the middle of the boonies to show him the Glades Terrace property . I piled this guy  --  and his maroon-colored poly-blend suit , his diamante-encrusted boots , and his ruby-studded gold bracelet  --  into my white BMW M6 and tore across westbound Tamiami Trail just before noon . He was a balding man of rugged complexion , Texan , about sixty years old , and he had an air about him I could n't pinpoint , not at first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poker , cashing in at $7.3 million , and I imagine one does not win that ungodly WSOP bracelet if one 's intentions are easily read . He seemed charming enough , a soft-spoken sort . But I could n't tell if he was quiet because he was wily , gullible , or even shy . I was hoping for door number two that morning . I needed gullible in a desperate way . <p> " Sub-Zero fridge . Antique walnut travertine bath . Turkish steam room . European touches . Garage capacity is four luxury-size cars . Or three Hummers ... " <p> I glanced over at the cowboy to see if I had piqued his curiosity , but he was staring out the window at the dreary landscape of Australian pines and melaleucas and ALLIGATOR WRESTLING signs . In the southern distance , the skies had begun to darken into that deadly shade of charcoal silver that is the default backdrop of summer afternoons in South Florida , and I knew I 'd better step on the gas if I wanted to outrun the tempest . <p> I amped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has history , you know . I hear they busted Al Capone out there once , " I said to him , but he did n't respond . " How about that for cocktail trivia ? " <p> The cowboy was unfazed . He seemed perplexed by our approach into the western fringes of the county . He seemed lost in serious thought , something I could n't afford as we headed for Glades Terrace . No , thinking is definitely not allowed when purchasing property at the precipitous edge of the Florida Everglades . <p> " It 's also where they filmed parts of The Specialist . Stallone flick . Great sound track , " I said , catching his eye at last . <p> He gave me a half smile but said nothing . Instead , his eyes traced the pearly buttons of my blouse like a slow bead of sweat , sending an unexpected shiver along the back of my arm . I tried to hide my uneasiness by smiling back , then glancing away as if I were trying to read the road signs . Sly devil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was to be a sale  --  would be no slam dunk . But it was n't until I turned into the overgrown driveway and saw the monumental wreck that was the Glades Terrace property that I realized just how tough the sale would be . It was going to be brutal , even for me . I can sell just about anything . I once sold a 1982 Camaro Iron Duke , deemed to be one of the " 50 Worst Cars of All Time " by Time magazine , for seven thousand bucks . I sold mangoes on eBay a few summers ago . I knocked them off the tree in my parents ' back yard and gave them a sexy name : Mangoes from Paradise . <p> The product description went like this : " Kill the pill routine and have a mango ! Would you rather choke back your daily dose of horse pills , the vitamin A , the vitamin E , the selenium , the iron , and the beta carotene ? Or would you rather dig into a juicy , luscious mango from paradise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months ago , I sold my wedding dress . This may not seem like a big deal to anyone at first mention , but it was . This was one hideous wedding dress . It was a champagne , textured-taffeta , overly ruffled specimen handpicked by my quite misguided groom as the " something new " component of my wedding day . Now riddle me this : What kind of lunatic bride allows her fiancT to surprise her on the eve of their wedding with the Dress ? The kind who deserves to wear it in front of her two hundred closest friends and relatives , as I did . But while my marriage met a crappy fate , my dress did not . It floated down the aisle at the Copacabana Banquet Hall in Hialeah Gardens on the curves of one brave Damaysi Yamisleidy Hernandez , a hairdresser newly arrived from Victoria de las Tunas , Cuba , who married the American boat captain who spirited her across the Straits of Florida . The captain was so smitten with her that he proposed on the sands of Hallandale Beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was scouring the online classifieds , hoping to find a fancy dress for his honey , and , boom , there it was , a dress that was more than fancy  --  it was fancy on steroids . <p> The " Surprise Me " Wedding Dress . <p> " It 's not a fairy-tale wedding without a surprise , " went my product description . " Fellas , this is the dress every bride will dream about . Trust me . It was the biggest surprise of my life . " <p> I sold it for one thousand seven hundred and fifty bucks . So , like I said , I can sell anything . This was my mantra at Glades Terrace that day . <p> " We 're here , " I said in the most upbeat voice I could muster as I pulled up in the shade of a knobby cypress tree . " Home sweet home . " <p> " Home sweet home " was an abandoned ranch-style mansion haphazardly plopped in the Florida wilds . Weeds and muck filled the grounds where a landscaper had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , over-the-top style of the cocaine-era nouveau riche . To reach the front door , I had to step along a weed-choked path in Christian Louboutin high heels , past an algae-infested artificial pond , a rusty yacht trailer , armies of screeching crickets , and the carcass of a burned-out sports car of some indistinguishable make . I turned around to check on the cowboy  --  the disturbed look on his face said it all . <p> " We 'll clean it all up , plant a couple dozen royal palms . It 'll be beautiful , " I told him as I climbed the steps to the front door . <p> I braced for the worst , imagining the place crawling with swampland creatures . If that was the case , I fully deserved it for being so friggin ' overeager . I had cajoled the listing from another agent , a sad sack named Brian , who had confided that he was taking a mental health day to go handle a domestic crisis . Word was he caught his wife in bed with their son 's wrestling coach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  like maybe show the Glades Terrace property . Brian puckered his face and thought about it for a long time . <p> " The place is a gold mine , " he finally said . <p> " I do n't know about that , " I said . " But I 'm glad to help out . " <p> What I meant was this : " Go home to your slutty wife and let me make this sale already . " <p> Brian gave my shoulder a brotherly squeeze . <p> " You are a good woman , Mary Guevara , " he said . " I hope you sell the heck out of that place . " <p> So there I was at the front door of the Glades Terrace property , trying to erase the Brian tangent from my head . Truth is I was haunted by this vision of him busting his PTA wife with some paunchy , middle-aged wrestler . I found the image more unsettling than the fact that I had swiped a sales lead from him . I have to confess I felt no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afford to feel guilt . I knew this sale could hoist me over the three-mil mark , land me on the top-seller map , and bring me closer to the life I had visualized on those evening workouts at home , on nights when I lost count of levels climbed on the elliptical machine . I could taste it . I had worked so hard to shake off the debris of a bad divorce , make a decent home for myself and my son , and hit my stride in a brand-new career at a time when business was in the dumps . I mean , what kind of fool takes up real estate when everybody else is hanging it up ? Only the queen of bad timing . <p> I gave the front door a good shove , hoping to scare off whatever lurked on the other side . But the door flung open with ease to reveal a stunning sight : a late- ' 70s nightmare . Chrome glinted off every angle of the place . In a sepia haze of rising dust , the sunken living room seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The glass shelves above the wet bar displayed a set of gold-leafed highball glasses and matching decanters . And , to boot , there was a disco ball . Let me put it this way : If those mirrored walls could talk , the stories would most likely involve powder-dusted hundred-dollar bills , a cache of automatic weapons , and a guy named El Gallo . Why Brian did n't stage this place , I 'll never know . But who was I to tell any of this to a Texas millionaire scavenging the spoils of a trashed market ? <p> " Note the hurricane-proof windows . Closed-circuit alarm system . Bullet-resistant doors all around . And there 's a phenomenal **25;558;TOOLONG room just down the hall , " is what I told him as I took command of the sordid mess . The client seemed to be taking in every detail of the tour : the trompe l'oeiled-out kitchen , the gold-plated bathrooms , the hall of mirrors . <p> The bedroom proved to be another time-warp scene . A huge , round bed dominated the circular suite . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lounge area of floor pillows , also red . Too much red . I had to glance out the window to refresh my eyes . But there was no view , only a tangle of branches through which I could barely see the daylight . It felt as if we were not in a room of a sprawling house but in some kind of pit , buried deep in the woods . I gasped to myself . Maybe it was the fear that this deal would be a bust , that this loss would send me into a free fall . My mind raced through a progression of extreme scenarios : bankruptcy . Poverty . Homelessness . How on earth would I support Max ? I leaned into the window , straining for a glimpse of sunlight . But instead I saw a dove . It was pressing through the brush , methodically weaving its body between the branches . It was clearly stuck , but it did n't seem to know it . There was no panic , just the weaving in and weaving out , twig to twig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found a clearing and flew away , into the darkening skies . The sight of this filled me with a strange defiance . <p> I turned to face the cowboy . He was sitting at the edge of the bed . <p> " You should know there was a gentleman here this morning who said this was his ' dream come true , ' " I said to him . <p> The cowboy reclined into an overstuffed scarlet pillow and let out a rumbling sigh . <p> " Well , I can certainly relate to that sentiment , " he said without a smile . <p> " You do n't find places like this anymore for under four , " I said . " It 'll be gone in ... " <p> I snapped my fingers to make the point . <p> " I 'll give you a little time , " I said , turning to leave . <p> I was nearly at the bedroom door when I heard the cowboy whistle . <p> " Darlin ' , " he said in an almost murmured way , " would you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's that ? " <p> " Will you go stand over there ? " he asked , signaling with his chin to some vague corner of the room . <p> " Where ? " <p> " Right over there , " he said , waving a hand toward the lounge area . <p> I made my way toward the mound of floor pillows , but I stopped abruptly when I realized what he was pointing to , something I had n't noticed before . It was a stripper 's pole , smack in the center of this musky little den area . A stripper 's pole , as if the Scarface decor cheese had n't been enough . And here was this man , this ungodly pile of polyester , asking me to step up to it  --  a stripper 's pole . What did he take me for ? Did I have some kind of flaming-heart tramp stamp tattooed to my lower regions ? No . Was my name Precious or Peaches or PorschT ? No . Did I smell of Angel eau de parfum by Thierry Mugler ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl . I 'm a nice , properly fragranced Cuban girl . <p> I fired a look at him , but he was n't paying attention . He was checking his watch , as if to say , " Get on the pole , bitch , I have n't got all day . " <p> Here 's what irked me about the cowboy 's request : In a way , I was already up there on that pole . In just about every real estate deal there comes that critical moment when you 've got to do the dance . It 's that do-or-die moment when the client is holding all the cards  --  and both of you know it . In the rarest of circumstances , the property sells itself and the sales agent is just there to breeze the buyer through it . But most of the time you do the dance , some kind of dance . You delete a clause or two . You reduce the price a notch or two . You compromise . Thanks to ol ' Brian , the Glades Terrace contract was already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was only the reality that this multimillion-dollar sale dangled by a thread , a buyer 's whim . And there was the pole . <p> I needed this commission . It meant I could afford the down payment on the new house I wanted , the Spanish-style house with the enormous landscaped yard and the free-form lagoon pool and the gourmet kitchen , near the best school in the county . <p> I gathered myself and walked over to the bed . <p> " I 'm not sure I heard you , sir . But if I heard you correctly , you 'd like me to go stand by that pole over there . " <p> " I would . " <p> " Where exactly on the pole , sir ? " <p> " Anywhere you 'd like is fine with me . " <p> " Anywhere ? " <p> " Yup . " <p> " Fine . " <p> I turned and walked toward the pole , shoulders rolled back , no hurry , as if to say , " I think I 'll go check out what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to the pole , I just leaned on it politely , and I said , " You mean like this ? " <p> " Exactly like that , " the customer said in a barely audible tone . " I like them legs ... " <p> " Come again ? " I said . <p> " I said I like them sun-kissed legs , darlin ' ... longer than July . " <p> " Thank you , sir , " I said , rattled a bit but doing my best not to show it . <p> For the first time that day , I locked into his stare and held it for a long moment . The cowboy reddened , then he laughed out loud . And he kept on laughing in that doubled-over , knee-slapping , short-of-breath way . So pathetic . He was having a grand time at my expense . I could just imagine what the ride back to Miami would be like with McCackles riding shotgun . So , on the spot at the base of that pole , I decided to shut him up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he lost it again when he saw me kick off my sandals and roll up my sleeves . He stopped chortling for a second , intrigued . I grabbed the pole with one arm and swung myself around . That 's right : I swung on the damn pole . One round for the big new yard . Another round for Max 's new playroom . Another round for my dream kitchen . <p> I gripped the pole with both hands and hoisted myself up , as if I were climbing the old coconut tree in the backyard of my childhood house in Hialeah . I used to go up that tree when I was nine years old , on bizarre double-dares from my best friend , Gina . <p> " Dare ya to take your shorts off and climb that tree , " she 'd say . <p> " Fine . " <p> I 'd peel off my gym shorts and clamber up the curved trunk until I reached the top . With one hand , I 'd swat at the coconuts until one of them came loose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the grass , laughing wildly , I 'd stop for a minute to catch the view from up top : the fruit trees and random clutter , the non sequitur of items on clotheslines , the frayed divisions of backyard fences unable to contain the ruckus of Cuban-exile factory-class families . <p> So this was a tree , not a stripper 's pole . This is what I told myself that day as I tucked the hem of my skirt between my thighs to prevent a peep show and I tightened my legs around the pole . I slid my way up to the top and when I got there , I could see the cowboy was no longer laughing . No , he looked like he was about to have a patatn , as my mother would say . I pushed off with my hands , slowly arching my back , until I was upside down . The room actually looked better that way , like a giant cherry-topped sundae . I slowly curled myself back up , wrapped my arms around the pole , and leaped off , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slipped on my sandals , and casually walked back to the astounded cowboy . <p> I leaned down toward the bed . <p> " Let 's make a deal , you and me , " I said . <p> " You name it , " he came back . <p> " If you go to that pole and do what I just did ... " <p> " Yeah , what ? " <p> " You do n't have to buy this place . " <p> The cowboy looked at me , bewildered , for a long moment . Then I heard him utter the words that would pole-vault me into a new tax bracket : <p> " I 'll take it , " he said . " I 'll take it , Sweet Mary .
