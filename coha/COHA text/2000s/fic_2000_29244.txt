Outside my window a mixture of rain and snow was settling into slush on Berkeley Street . I was listening to a spring training game from Florida between the Sox and the Blue Jays . Joe Castiglione and Jerry Trupiano were calling the game and struggling bravely to read all the drop-ins the station had sold . They did as well as anyone could , but Red Barber and Mel Allen would have had trouble with the number of commercials these guys had to slip in . The leisurely pace of baseball had once been made for radio . It allowed the announcers to talk about baseball in perfect consonance with the rhythm of the game . We listened not only to hear what happened but because we liked the music of it . The sound of a late game from the coast , between two teams out of contention on a Sunday afternoon in August , driving home from the beach . The crowd noise was faint in the background , the voices of the play-by-play guys embroidering on a dull game . Now there was little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play-by-play . And much of the music was gone . Still , it was the sound of spring , and it took some of the chill out of the slush storm . Just after the fifth inning started , Hawk came into my office with a smallish man in a short haircut , wearing a dark three-piece suit and a red and white polka dot bow tie . His skin was blue black and seemed tight on him . I turned the radio down , but not off . " Client , " Hawk said . " Ever hopeful , " I said . I recognized the small man . His name was Robinson Nevins . He was a professor at the university , the authorof at least a dozen books , a frequent guest on television shows , and a nationally known figure in what the press calls The Black Community . Time magazine had once referred to him as " the Lion of Academe . " " I 'm Robinson Nevins , " he said and put his hand out . I leaned forward and shook it without getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a client . We need to talk a bit first , among other things we ought to find out if we can get along . " " Whose tab ? " I said to Hawk . " Guarantee half everything I get , " Hawk said . " That much , " I said . " I ca n't afford very much , " Nevins said . " Maybe we wo n't get along , " I said . " I am dependent largely on a university salary and , as I 'm sure you know , that is not a handsome sum . " " Depends what sums you 're used to , " I said . " How about the books ? " " The books are well received , and have influence I hope beyond their sales . Their sales are modest . I make some money on the lecture circuit , but far too often I speak because I feel the cause is just rather than the price is right . " " Do n't you hate when that happens , " I said . Nevins smiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What would you like to pay me a modest amount to do ? " I said . " I have been denied tenure , " Nevins said . I stared at him . " Tenure ? " I said . " Yes . Unjustly . " " And you want me to look into that ? " I said . " Yes . " " Tenure , " I said . " Yes . " I was silent . Nevins did n't say anything else . I looked at Hawk . " You want me to do this ? " I said to Hawk . " Yes . " I was silent again . " I understand your reaction , " Nevins said . " I sound churlish to you . And you think that there are causes of greater urgency than whether I get tenure at the university . " I pointed a finger at Nevins . " Bingo , " I said . " I know , were I you that would be my reaction . But it is not simply that I am denied tenure and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job . What is at issue here is that I should n't have been denied tenure . I am more qualified than most members of the tenure committee . More qualified than many who have received tenure . " " You think it 's racial ? " I said . " It would be an easy supposition and one most of us have made correctly in our lives , " Nevins said . " But I am , in fact , not sure that it is . " " What else ? " I said . " I do n't know . I am something of an anomaly for a black man at the university . I am relatively conservative . " " What do you teach ? " " American literature . " " Black perspective ? " " Well , my perspective . I include black writers , but I also include a number of dead white men . " " Daring , " I said . " Do you know that we are turning out English Ph.Ds who have never read Milton ? " " I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were shot down for being insufficiently correct ? " " Possibly , " Nevins said . " I do n't know . What I know is there was a smear campaign orchestrated by someone , which I believe cost me tenure . " " You want me to find out who did the smearing ? " " Yes . " I looked at Hawk again . He nodded . " Would n't an attorney be more likely to get you your tenure ? " " I am not fighting this because I did n't get tenure . I 'm fighting this because it 's wrong . " " If you got the tenure decision reversed , would you accept it ? " Nevins smiled at the question . " You press a person , do n't you , " he said . " I like to know things , " I said . " Like how sincere I am about fighting this because it 's wrong . " " That would be good to know , " I said . " If I were offered tenure I would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the process was still wrong . " " What was the thrust of the smear campaign ? " Hawk appeared to be listening to the faintly audible ball game . And he was . If asked , he could give you the score and recap the last inning . He would also be able to tell you everything I said or Nevins said and how we looked when we said it . " A young man , a graduate student , committed suicide this past semester . It was alleged to be the result of a sexual relationship with me . " " What was his name ? " I said . " Prentice Lamont . " " Any truth to it ? " " None . " I nodded . " I imagine you 'd like that laid to rest as well . " " Yes . " " Okay , " I said . " Okay meaning you 'll do it ? " " Yep . " Nevins seemed mildly puzzled . " Like that ? " " Yep . " " Are n't you going to ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Why not ? " " Do n't care . " " But , " Nevins frowned , " it might be germane . " " If it is , I 'll ask , " I said . Nevins opened his mouth and closed it and sat back in his chair . Then he took a green-covered checkbook out of his inside coat pocket . " What will you need for a retainer ? " " No need for a retainer , " I said . " Oh , but I insist . I do n't want favors . " Hawk was looking out the window at the slush accumulating around the stylishly booted ankles of the young women leaving the insurance companies on their way to lunch . Without turning around he said , " He doing me the favor , Robinson . " Nevins was not slow . He looked once at Hawk , and back at me , and nodded to himself . He put the green checkbook back inside his coat and stood . " Do you need anything else right now ? " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see what develops . " " And I 'll hear from you ? " " Yes , " I said . " Will you be involved , Hawk ? " Hawk turned from the window and grinned at Nevins . " Sure , " he said . " I 'll help him with the hard stuff . " Nevins put out his hand . " I appreciate your taking this , " he said , " for whomever you 're doing the favor . " I shook it . " You need a ride anyplace ? " he said to Hawk . Hawk shook his head . Nevins nodded as if to confirm something in his head , and turned and left . Hawk continued to look out the window . The ball game had moved quietly into the eighth inning . Outside my window it was mostly rain now . Hawk turned away from the window and looked at me without expression . " Tenure ? " I said . Hawk smiled . " ' Fraid so , " he said .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
