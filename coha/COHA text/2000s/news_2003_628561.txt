<p> A once-overgrown north Houston city park is being transformed into a place where people can play , jog or listen to performances at a Roman-style rotunda - all while surrounded by tributes to the people who helped to make such freedom possible : The city 's war veterans . <p> The plan is to open the remodeled Tidwell/Hardy Park , 1986 Tidwell Road , on Veterans Day , Nov. 11 , to honor all men and women , without regard to ethnicity - anyone who called Houston home and who served their country while in uniform , especially during conflicts from the War for Texas Independence to recent conflicts in the Middle East . <p> It just happens to be native Houstonians of Hispanic heritage , as well as City Councilman Gabriel Vasquez and artist Rosalinda Toro , who are bringing the project together . <p> " Among the guys who went to war , we 're not Hispanics , we 're not soldiers . We 're brothers . And Americans , " said Richard Perez , 56 , a 1965 Jefferson Davis High School graduate whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replacement and a desire to see that his friend Frank Montemayor - and others who did n't make it back to Houston from the war - were not forgotten . <p> Houston City Council members including Vasquez voted in May , the week before Memorial Day , to approve the proposal to make the park a playground and a permanent memorial using about $ 1 million of bond money in the city 's Capital Improvments Fund . <p> Last week , local artist Rosalinda Toro unveiled her sculpture that will be a park centerpiece , " Witness to Freedom , " at her studio , Rose Arts Works , 11020 Old Katy Road , on the city 's west side . <p> While the work to make the park a reality has accelerated in recent weeks , it was just a couple of years ago that it was simply an idea in the minds of four north Houston veterans , said Vasquez , whose north Houston district includes the park property , as well as all or parts of Denver Harbor , the Heights , Independence Heights , Near Northside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These four guys , veterans themselves , came to see me , " Vasquez said . " They had talked to other people before , but I supported their idea . My brother served in Operation Desert Storm and recently in Iraq , " Vasquez said . " I was very moved , and I gave them my personal commitment . This was a group of Hispanic veterans who had a concern for all veterans . " <p> In April , Vasquez sponsored a campaign to supply American troops who remain in Iraq with additional supplies , an effort joined by students from schools - including Sam Houston and Jefferson Davis high schools - within Vasquez 's District H area . <p> It was n't just Vasquez 's patriotic zeal , however , that made him think that the park might be a worthwhile project . <p> " The park was underdeveloped , with nothing there for the children . Now , we 'll have a playground for our young children and soccer and baseball fields that will double as parade and drill fields for the ROTC , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of honor , with extensions set off the trail with kiosks that will allow veterans ' groups to be recognized . " <p> The designs for the park and for Toro 's art emerged during meetings with the Cultural Arts Council of Houston and the Municipal Arts Council , as well as the veterans themselves . <p> " It was very moving , " Vasquez said . " We 'd sit in these meetings to discuss the veterans ' ideas , and they would tell us about their commitment and their sacrifice . " <p> Areas of the park will be areas with tiles and plaques on park benches that have been inscribed with the names of people who fought in America 's major wars . Each war memorial area will be planted with trees and shrubs that were native to areas of various conflicts , with " plenty of bamboo " for the tribute to the veterans of Vietnam , Perez said . <p> Perez remembers that war , especially the moment he was eating a hard-to-get ration of fruit cocktail when he heard a " rustling in the bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members of an intelligence-gathering Reconissance group in the 1st Marine Division were fired upon by about 200 Viet Cong . His actions that day earned him the Bronze Star with a combat V designation , as well as memories of the soldier who was cut in half by enemy fire while providing Perez 's cover . <p> The Marines later gave Perez a Bronze Star with a combat V. Perez promptly returned it . <p> " It 's not about the medals , " he said . <p> In the first phase of the park 's reconstruction , the first war that will be recognized will be World War II , when another veteran on the park committee , Domingo Trevino , brought home to north Houston the Distinguished Flying Cross after flying 37 missions in the Pacific . <p> He spent his high school years working for the Naval Manufacturing Supply Company and married at age 20 , just four months before the Japanese strike on Pearl Harbor . In 1943 , he was drafted and his high test scores - and his refusal in basic training to take second @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position as an airplane mechanic in the U.S. Air Force . <p> " The man in charge , he did n't like us too much . He said , ' All Mexicans , move over to the right . ' But I did n't move . I said ' I 'm an American , and I 'm just as good as the rest , ' " said Trevino , 82 . <p> The Air Force sent him to gunnery school , where he learned to take a machine gun apart and put it back together while blindfolded , and he was soon promoted to assistant flight engineer and sent to heavy bombardment training . <p> He was an aerial photographer and , later , a weather-watcher , with a job to keep his eye peeled for hurricanes and typhoons . But flying B-24 aircraft to Guam one day , a radar operator mistakenly led his squadron into a hurricane of up to 120-mph winds . It was his calm actions that day with the 20th Air Force Squadron 's weather reconnissance group that earned him at least two of the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north . <p> It 's another flight , though , that he remembers : a relatively uneventful flight in the lower ball turret of a fighter aircraft as it made its way over Tokyo on Aug. 5 , 1945 , exactly one day before another aircraft known as , the Enola Gay , dropped her deadly cargo on Hiroshima . <p> For Margarito C. Vasquez , 68 , it was experience in two wars that made him proud to be a proud supporter of vetereans ' causes . <p> He went into the Marine Corps Reserves in 1950 and he volunteered to go to Korea on Sept. 15 , of that year to carry a Browning automatic rifle in the infantry . His group of fresh troops landed on the East coast of the Korean Peninsula and headed north to a place called Chosin Reservoir . Vasquez was 16 years old . <p> " It kind of reminded me of what ( Lt. Col. George ) Custer saw before the Battle of Little Bighorn , " he said . <p> Several books have been written about that bloody campaign , about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people spend an entire lifetime wondering if they made a difference . The Marines do n't have that problem . " <p> It was n't being wounded in battle - which earned him a Purple Heart - but an operable tumor that brought his tender age to light and caused Vasquez to be sent home , not that he was there for long . As soon as he recovered , he enlisted in the Marines again and returned to Korea , serving 1952-1954 , then became what he calls " a Hollywood Marine , " a recruiter . <p> He had a family , a wife and four young children , by the time he volunteered again to go into active duty . This time , it was 1968-1969 , and the assignment was to participate in the heaviest bombardment campaign of the Vietnam conflict . <p> " It 's hard , when you see your brothers and they 're dying and you 're back here , safe and sound , " Vasquez said . <p> He was in the infantry , then moved to a tank field command with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Rubber wheels beat rubber heels any day , " he said . <p> Details of the park 's planned amenities - such as a rotunda ampitheater that faces East , the direction in which the graves of their lost comrades face - are important to Perez , Trevino , Vasquez and others . They say it 's important because of those who went before them , including the average 1,500 World War II veterans who are dying daily in America - and for the ones who will join the military ranks of the future . <p> " Some young people do n't even know what a veteran is , " Perez said . " They think war is a computer game . This will at least let them know that veterans were people who lived , who bled and died for their country . It will be a place they can come to see why we 're a free country . "
