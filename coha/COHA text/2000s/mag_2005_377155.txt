Until last week , Steve Jobs was not known for going after budget-conscious shoppers . Instead , $3,000 CPUs and $600 iPods were more the Apple CEO 's speed . But after his company 's strong holiday sales and the quadrupling of its first-quarter profits from the year before , Jobs can afford to be generous . As of next week you will be able to buy an entry-level Mac for $500 and a scaled-down iPod for $99 . The new iPod is no heftier than a pack of gum , while the Mini Mac is smaller than your average Harry Potter hardcover . <P> Of course , you 're making some sacrifices for those prices . The Mini Mac is what Jobs calls BYODKM  --  bring your own display , keyboard and mouse . That makes it ideal if you 're a Windows user who wants to switch teams and already has those peripherals ( the Mini Mac will work with just about any recent brand ) . But BYODKM is not such a bargain if you 're starting from scratch  --  especially if you want extras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back another $79 . <P> The Mini Mac is a surprisingly powerful beast for its size . It has roughly the same memory and hard-drive size as a low-end G4 Power Mac and comes with the latest version of Mac OS X. Plug in the peripherals , and you will rarely notice the difference . The $99 iPod Shuffle , however , could never be mistaken for its larger cousin . There 's no screen on which to view the song currently playing , and it holds only 126 tracks . ( A $150 model doubles that capacity . ) It 's called the Shuffle because that 's the best thing you can do with it : stick it into the USB port of your computer , and it will quickly download a new random selection ( or a particular playlist ) from the iTunes jukebox . This is great if you 're a passive music listener but infuriating if you like to find particular songs . <P> Ultimately , there 's a reason these products are called entry level : they exist largely to tempt you to upgrade to pricier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  especially if your name is Steve Jobs .
