Chapter One The calendar said it was November , but the scudding gray clouds and lowering sky made it seem as though winter had arrived in southern Ohio . The maples and slippery elms had long ago lost their leaves . The mottled trunks of the sycamores blended into the white and gray of the storm clouds . Only the oaks held stubbornly to their tattered brown leaves , the way she had been holding stubbornly to her grief . No , not stubbornly , Faith Carson told herself as she trudged along the path that skirted a small lake and ended at a tiny , hidden roadside park bordering her farm . " Surely six months is n't too long to mourn a dead husband ? " She was n't talking to herself , not really . She 'd addressed the question to her two-year-old Shetland sheepdog , Addy , trotting at her heels . She 'd found Addy at the local animal shelter a few weeks after she 'd moved into the echoing old farmhouse that Mark had inherited from his grandparents , and which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set foot in . Addy was the only friend Faith had at the moment . The little dog pricked her ears at the question and gave a yip of sympathetic agreement . Six months . Not nearly long enough when that sorrow was coupled with the aching loss of a child barely conceived . Surely six months was only a beginning . Faith blinked hard to hold back tears as icy raindrops touched her cheeks . She had nothing left in her but a sense of bereavement so deep and unrelenting she sometimes felt as though she had died , too , on that mountain road in Mexico . They had been vacationing , their first real vacation since their marriage , looking for the remote area where thousands of monarch butterflies came to spend the winter . Mark was a computer programmer whose passion was butterflies . It was a trip he had wanted to take for as long as she had known him . But a washed-out section of road and a blown tire had caused their rented Jeep to roll over . Somehow , for some reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped as she held him in her arms and their baby 's life drained away between her legs . A loss like that scarred the heart so much the healing might take six years , or sixty - or never come . She walked out of the trees just behind the rustic two-sided building that , along with a pair of old-fashioned outhouses and a rusty jungle gym , were the park 's only amenities . An expensive , sporty blue car was parked in the graveled lot at the edge of the small body of water the county had named Sylvan Lake , but that was still known to the locals of Bartonsville , Ohio , as Carson 's Pond . A young couple , the boy 's arms wrapped around the girl , her head resting on his shoulder , sat on one of the picnic tables near the blackened fieldstone fireplace that took up the entire north wall of the building . Faith halted , half-hidden by a huge pine whose low branches brushed the ground , and acted as a windbreak on one side of the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the park on a day like this , certainly not a pair of amorous teenagers . She took a quick step back , deeper into the shadow of the pine . They had n't seen her . She could melt back into the woods , retrace her steps through the frosty grass and be home before the raindrops that were now falling steadily changed to sleet . Addy growled low in her throat . " Shh . " Faith knelt down to fasten the leash she carried in her pocket to the dog 's collar before Addy could begin barking in earnest . She scooped the small dog into her arms and prepared to depart . The teenagers were absorbed in each other and did n't look in her direction , but some trick of sound brought their words to her ears . " Beth , we ca n't stay here . There must be a town close by . Maybe it 's big enough for a hospital . " " If we go to a hospital they 'll call your parents . " The girl cried out , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two moonstruck teenagers making out . Something far more serious than that was going on . Addy whined nervously and squirmed in Faith 's arms . The boy turned his head and stared directly into her eyes . " Help us , " he said , his face as gray-white as the clouds and the sycamore trees . He was blond , broad-shouldered , square-jawed , seventeen or eighteen at most . A good-looking kid , or would be if he were n't half-scared to death . " My girlfriend 's having a baby . And I do n't know what to do . " Faith could n't believe her ears , did n't want to . He could n't have said what she thought she had heard . " Please , " he said , raising his voice so there could be no doubt as he repeated the words . " She 's having a baby . I do n't know what to do . " Instinctively Faith shook her head . " I do n't , either , " she murmured , but he could n't hear her above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did know what to do . That was one of the things that made her own loss so hard to bear . She was a nurse . She had the skill and knowledge to help save lives . Once , she had even delivered a baby herself . But that had been five years ago in the hospital emergency room where she 'd worked while Mark finished up his graduate studies . She had been young and fearless , then . Now she was not . She had n't even set foot in a hospital since three days after her miscarriage . The girl shifted her position , and Faith took a better look at her , her heart sinking . Her arms were wrapped around her swollen middle , which strained against the fabric of her pale-green sweater . She was n't wearing a coat and shivered in the cold air . She was very , very pregnant . Her face was white , her eyes dark with fear . " I - I hurt so badly . I ca n't walk . " Feminine instinct and medical training @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tied Addy to a sapling at the corner of the shelter and hushed her with a stern warning . The little dog dropped to her belly on the cold ground whimpering with anxiety , sensing the tension in the humans around her , but obedient to Faith 's command . Faith looked from one terrified young face to the other . " She needs to be taken to the hospital . " She took off her all-weather coat and draped it around the shivering girl 's shoulders . She was wearing the sweatshirt Mark had given her for Christmas the year before , a heavy black one covered front and back with butterflies so she would be warm enough without her coat . " No ! " The girl panted , then bit her lip and groaned , a low , guttural sound . The sound of a woman who was almost ready to give birth . Faith 's heart hammered . This could n't be happening . Not today of all days . The day her own child should have been born . " Your baby is coming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold . I 'll give you directions to the hospital in Bartonsville . When you get there the nurses can notify your families - " Silvery strands of gossamer-fine hair danced in the cold air as the girl shook her head . " I do n't have a family , " she said defiantly . " Only my brother in Texas . " " What about you ? " " I - I do n't have any family , either , " he said miserably . ( Continues ... )
