The national League 's deepest relation , the Giants figure they can outlast the Diamondbacks in the N.L. West Photograph // It 's a Survivor kind of summer , especially during baseball 's pennant races , so let 's play along . In honor of the smash television series that winds up this week , let 's put Giants pitcher Kirk Rueter on a desert island ( not literally , mind you ) with Randy Johnson , Curt Schilling , Mike Hampton , Al Leiter , Greg Maddux , Tom Glavine and Kevin Brown and let them all vote to toss out the weak link . How do you like Rueter 's chances in that ensemble ? " Heck , he does n't even have a breaking ball , says his pitching coach , Dave Righetti , assessing the field . " He 's the only lefthander I 've ever seen who does n't have one . " That 's right . In that group , Rueter would - be off the island faster than you can say " Hoyleton , " which is the name of the farming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come to think of it , might not be all that dissimilar from a desert island in the South China Sea . Hoyleton , III. , Pop . 450 and falling . Pretty deserted . But there 's Rueter , helping to write the same sort of survival guide for the Giants this season that those other fancy pitchers are doing for the Diamondbacks , the Mets , the Braves and the Dodgers . Before getting drilled by the Braves last Sunday , he was ninth in the National League with a 3.72 earned-run average ( and sixth in the N.L. in home ERA at 2.46 ) . He 's 6-4 over his last 14 starts and has worked at least six innings in 18 of his 24 outings . Until the Expos and Braves smacked him around last week , Rueter had allowed no more than two runs in eight straight starts . Think any of those other desert island castaways would n't crow about a streak like that ? In fact , put up Rueter 's numbers over eight seasons in the majors against the rest of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first to get booted off that island after all . Since 1980 , only two other lefties have a higher winning percentage than Rueter 's .629 , and their names are Randy Johnson and Andy Pettitte . More to the point , their names are n't Glavine , Hampton or Leiter . Still , if Rueter came in front of a tribal council of his peers , he likely would n't survive , especially right now . In fact , he might get skinned alive , and it would n't have anything to do with his pitching skills . Instead , they 'd turn on him for his negotiating acumen , or lack thereof . Rueter , who was two months away from free agency , did a major disservice two weeks ago to every other top-dollar player in the game by signing a new three-year , $15.6 million contract with San Francisco , an absolute steal for the Giants . He undersold himself by $5 million , maybe more . The Tagi Alliance of free agents-to-be , the ones looking for the megamillion-dollar paydays this winter , wo n't much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I do n't fit in that group , anyway , " Rueter says , playing along with our game . I 'd probably be the first one they booted off the island , unless they wanted to keep me around to eat or something . But if Rueter is the wallflower at a mixer that includes Brown , Maddux , Johnson and the others , he certainly blends in well with the rest of the Giants . For the last few years , they 've been calling him " Woody , " a sobriquet originally bestowed by former Giant Darryl Hamilton . Why ? Well , no one has seen Rueter and the animated character from Toy Story in the same room at the same time . They could be the same person . Photograph GIANT STRIDES : Lefthander Estes has been a significant contributor to a San Francisco pitching staff that is short on glamour and long on production . // Rueter is unquestionably the perfect fit with the rest of San Francisco 's starters , who on paper all seem to pale ; like Rueter , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Giants ' six starters together , and they make up a rotation quietly outperforming every other staff in the National League . That includes the Diamondbacks ' staff , which a month ago added Schilling to a rotation already anchored by Johnson . Since the All-Star break , San Francisco 's team ERA of 3.15 is the best in the majors , and the rotation 's second-half ERA of 3.32 leads the N.L. The Giants may not have the studs , but they appear to be better built for the grind of September than just about any staff this side of Atlanta . And if they do n't have an obvious edge in a playoff matchup against a staff that could feature , say , Hampton and Leiter in the first two games , the depth of their October options makes it likely they 'll be able to keep any series close . This is what Righetti and manager Dusty Baker have at their disposal heading into the stretch run . Livan Hernandez , listed at 25 , the closest thing to an ace on the staff . Since a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the most reliable pitchers in the majors , going 12-5 . Over his last 12 starts , he 's 8-3 with a 3.59 ERA . Since the break , those numbers are 5-2 and 2.57 . He has given the Giants more innings than all but six other pitchers in the league have given their teams , and he shut down the Braves 2-0 last Friday . Ruse Ortiz , 26 , who took a 192 , inning scoreless streak into his start against Atlanta on Saturday and then allowed only two earned runs in 62 innings and got the win . Ortiz , an 18-game winner last season , struggled early this year but is 5-2 with a 2.66 ERA since the All-Star break and has been nearly unhittable in August . Going into this week , he 'd given up 14 hits all month . Shawn Estes , 9-1 , 3.42 over his last 15 starts , and those numbers could be even more impressive . Entering this week he had n't lost since June 10 . In all five of his no-decisions since then , he left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leads the majors in inducing double plays . Mark Gardner , at 38 the old man of the staff . Since he replaced injured Joe Nathan in the rotation at the start of the second half , Gardner is 3-2 with a 3.63 ERA . In 104.1 innings , he has only walked 27 hitters . And 2 9-year-old Rueter , who was working on a 2.95 ERA in nine starts from July 1 to August 15 , until he gave up six runs in 41/3 inning in last Sunday 's 8-5 loss to the Braves and his season ERA grew to 3.92 . In addition , Nathan , 25 ; a hardthrowing rookie who has been on the disabled list twice this season with shoulder problems , was expected back this week . All he has done when he has been healthy is put together a 5-2 record with a 4.86 ERA . In between his two stints on the D.L. , Nathan 's numbers were 3-1 and 3.51 . That gives Baker six solid starters for five rotation spots , with Nathan currently the odd man out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ started a game this season for the Giants . Only St. Louis , among N.L. contenders , comes close to that kind of consistency from its starters , and the Cardinals recently lost Andy Bones to the D.L. That 's one of the reasons the Giants barely flinched when Arizona acquired Schilling at the trading deadline and San Francisco countered only with a minor deal to bring in middle reliever Doug Henry . ( One other reason may be Schilling 's 3-6 career record against San Francisco . His three wins over the Giants are his fewest against any National League team except Arizona . ) " We 've always thought if we played to our potential , we 'd have a chance in August and September with the guys we already had , " Rueter says . " You ca n't control what other teams are going to do , and that definitely was a big acquisition by Arizona . Schilling to go along with Randy Johnson , looks pretty formidable . But we thought even coming out of spring training that we already had enough guys here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is starting to swing better . We 've got a chance . I 'm not saying we 're going to win it , but all you can ask for is a chance . " The Giants finished with the Braves last weekend by taking two of three and began a stretch of 29 straight games against teams below .500 . That should set up a wild finish to September . The Giants won three of the five games they played against Arizona in April . Now , down the stretch , eight of their last 11 games are head to head with the Diamondbacks , including a three-game series that ends the season in Phoenix " I really like the Giants , " San Diego general manager Kevin Towers says . " I think they 're going to win our division . I know I never feel comfortable when we 're playing them . We could have a two- or three-run lead late , and you just know they 're going to find a way to come storming back . They do n't have that one big ace for a playoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them out in front of somebody else . But they still seem to win a lot of games . " They 've got a lot of 3s " in that rotation , but there 's nothing wrong with that . It 's better to have a staff full of 3s than a staff of a 1 ' and a bunch of 5s . ' " Coming out of last week 's 4-3 road trip and the series win over Atlanta at home , the Giants at least were positioned to keep pace until the end . Perhaps more than any other National League contender , San Francisco seems to be taking an all-for-one approach to the last five weeks . Rueter 's new contract is emblematic of that . Rather than face the prospect of leaving a young and talented rotation at the end of the year , he chose to stabilize it for the stretch . " ' This is a tight-knit group , " he says . " It 'd really be hard to leave . It gets to be like you 're in a family here , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think it starts with Dusty . He makes everybody part of the team here , and I think a lot of the players enjoy that . I really think that 's one of the reasons we 're able to stay in games and win as much as we do . " Count the Diamondbacks , incidentally , among those teams that lately do n't appear to be the tightknit group the Giants are . Arizona continues to win , but in the last couple of weeks the defending N.L. West champions have had to weather reports that their manager 's job is in jeopardy and the franchise is in financial trouble . Other people around the league are noticing the difference . " ( The Giants ) have enough speed , enough defense , enough power , enough experience , enough starting pitching and plenty of bullpen , " says Expos manager Felipe Alou , whose club was swept by San Fracisco at home last week " I think they play more relaxed baseball than the Dodgers or the Diamondbacks . I think that 's because of Dusty . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other side . " Photograph NOT JUST A SURVIVOR : Rueter stacks up when compared with higher-profile pitchers . WELL-ARMED : Baker 's rotation is deep . // Alou 's Expos got an up-close look at Baker 's rotation last week , when Gardner stopped them on one run over seven innings and Estes checked them the next day with a five-hit , three-run performance over 7213 innings . Even in Rueter 's subpar outing , the Giants hung tough to get to the late innings with a lead . That 's been the hallmark of the rotation through San Francisco 's second-half surge . The starters have been savvy enough to survive through at least six innings in 32 of 37 games they 've played since the All-Star break . And the eighth- and ninthinning combination of Felix Rodriguez and Robb Nen has become one of baseball 's best Nen 's save last Wednesday was his 30th of the season , the fourth straight year he 's had at least that many . This is how dominant Rodriguez and Nen have been : They 've pitched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , their combined ERA is 1.13 , and they 've struck out 89 hitters and walked only 28 . Since the Fourth of July , the dynamic duo of Rodriguez and Nen has appeared together 14 times and given up exactly one earned run , a 0.32 ERA in those games . Nen , of all people , knows the value of an inning-eating rotation . He was the closer on the Marlins ' 1997 World Series championship team that featured Brown , Leiter and Alex Fernandez and beat the Braves in the NLCS . " We had a bunch of so-called No. 1s down in Florida , " Nen says . " Those were all guys who made a lot of money and on most teams would be the No. 1 pitcher . This team has a bunch of guys who are young , who are going to be No . Is in a few years . If this staff stays together , it 's going to have three or four guys just like the Marlins did . These guys have been awesome . It 's fun watching them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , even if it has n't always been easy in his first year as a major league pitching coach . He 's seeing the rewards now of his early work with each of them . Righetti has helped Hernandez , for instance , rediscover his ability to pitch inside , which was one problem in his 0-4 start . He has watched Estes gain strength with each outing , coming off shoulder problems early in the year to develop a low changeup and sinker and replace some of the heavy volume of high fastballs he used to throw . He has seen Ortiz battle his reputation for wildness , refine his control and even begin to get a few breaks from the umpires . And he has watched Rueter , the only lefthander in existence without a breaking ball , change speeds as well as anybody in the league . " I exaggerate about that breaking-ball stuff , " Righetti says . " Woody has a breaking ball . He just does n't use it much He does n't have to . He adjusts by taking miles per hour off his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there . " On paper , top to bottom , San Francisco probably does n't match up with the Arizonas and Atlantas of the league . Even Righetti and Rueter admit the Giants do n't look as good on paper as some of the other playoff hopefuls . But if you 're looking for survivors , fearlessness is a good character trait on which to draw . Tr Michael Knisley is a senior writer for THE SPORTING NEWS . <p>
