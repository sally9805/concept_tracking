Chapter One NOTHING HAD PREPARED Paul Stepola for living a double life , and there were days when he wondered how long he could go on . That was n't like him . He had been military , a man 's man , a decorated operative in the National Peace Organization . But he had seldom been called upon to work under cover . He had always been a straightforward representative of the government of the United Seven States of America . Paul relied on his bearing , his presence , his intellect , his communication skills . Pretending to be someone else had been fun on the few occasions his assignment called for it , but those had always been short-term , means to ends . Now his whole life was an elaborate deceit . Paul was a mole within his own agency , within his own family . He had undergone the greatest transformation a man could , and he could think of nothing he would rather do than tell his wife and children and include them in his new life . But he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether she would tell her father , Paul could not risk it . The truth in the wrong hands meant death for him and perhaps for his family as well . And the NPO would settle for nothing less than being led to whatever underground factions had compromised their star . It was one thing to show up at the Chicago bureau office and be lauded as a premier enemy of the underground while secretly supporting the rebels . It was quite another to be unable to even tell your wife what had caused the change in your personality . For all Jae knew , their reconciliation and renewed attempts to repair the marriage were her ideas . He was finally ready and even equipped to make the changes , but she had to wonder why . If only he could tell her . Wintermas of 37 P.3 was an ordeal , another visit to Jae 's parents in Washington , this time with her obnoxious older brother in attendance . Berlitz ( who had named these people ? ) had brought along his third wife , Aryana-yet another he complained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out any progeny . " Aryana looked crushed and was stony the rest of the time , which at least made her fit the family . Jae 's father , Ranold B. Decenti , wore his usual scowl , formally acknowledging the children when noticing them at all . He could n't hide his disgust over his only son , who had , he said , " never succeeded at anything except graduating high school . " It was all Paul could do to get through the long weekend . When they sang and ate and opened gifts , he wished he could sing what was in his heart , that he could pray aloud , that he could celebrate the birth of Christ rather than " the bounty of the season . " For Jae 's part , she seemed genuinely appreciative of the new Paul . She commented more than once about his getting along with the difficult personalities and his attentiveness to her and the kids . " It 's not me , " Paul wanted to say . But all he could do was smile . How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ onto him , looking for ways to trip him up ? Why the sudden change in her ? He had never felt so precariously on the edge of an abyss . The pressure affected his sleep , threatened to make jagged his new personality . It was as if he teetered all the time . Late at night , as was his custom , Ranold liked to debrief , as he called it , the events of the day with the " menfolk . " But the short , dark , spiky-haired Berlitz , eager as he seemed to share a drink in Ranold 's den , had little to offer . He was from another world , a salesman on commission . " Do you not even watch the news , boy ? " Ranold said , reddening . " Do you not keep up at all ? " " Some , " Berlitz said . " Not like you two , I guess . " " I guess not ! Do you not care what goes on in the world ? " The adult son shrugged , sitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing up in that home . For now he was grateful Berlitz was taking the attention off him . Paul 's every word had to be weighed . He had to be constantly on guard and appear to give the party line . All the while he was privately celebrating the events in Los Angeles , but of course that could never come out . As Berlitz and Ranold consumed more alcohol , their inhibitions , never well controlled , seemed to evaporate . " This one , " Ranold would begin , nodding toward his son before launching into an assumption about how the man thought . " Yeah , speak for me like you always do , " Berlitz would say . " At least you 're givin ' me credit for having a thought in my head . " " My mistake , " Ranold said . " Thanks , Dad . " " For giving you credit , I mean . " Berlitz flipped his father an obscene gesture . " I ever did that to my dad , " Ranold said , " I 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ na try something with a forty-year-old man ? " Berlitz said . Ranold waved him off . Merry Christmas , Paul thought . " One more for the road , " Berlitz said , rising to pour himself another . " Where you going ? " Ranold said . " Just to bed . Ca n't get rid of me that easy , pops . " " You need booze to sleep ? " " I need booze for a lot of things . " Ranold seemed embarrassed when his son was gone . " Do n't let Connor grow up to be like that , " he said . Paul could n't imagine it . He was just grateful the discussion topic was not business for once . " How do I ensure that , sir ? What would you have done differently ? " " Put him on his can when I was able , " Ranold said . " I bought into all the ' let ' em be ' bull . Look what that produced . " " He 's all right . " " He 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double take . Ranold had n't liked Paul much in Los Angeles . At times they were at each other 's throats . In the end , though , the result seemed to take heat and suspicion off Paul . He could n't have been behind the drought phenomenon , and that turned Ranold 's ire from him to the underground . He was still seething . " I do n't like the way NPO brass and the government kowtow to the rebels , " Ranold said . Paul raised an eyebrow . " You are NPO brass , sir . " " Not really . But ' slong as I 've got any clout , I 'm going to do things the old-fashioned way . I catch one of these yahoos from the underground , I 'm not looking the other way , I 'll tell you that . " " Not afraid of a judgment from God ? " Paul said , pretending to tease . " Nah . You ? " " No , sir . " That was no lie . " I see big things ahead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " In the organization . " Here we go . " I do n't know , sir . " " I do . They like you . I like you . You 've succeeded where many have failed . " Paul studied the old man . Maybe the alcohol had already done its work on him the way it had on his son . But he was good . Could he already be onto Paul , flattering him to see if he could cause a misstep ? Was Ranold really so naive about the difference between a real person of faith and the charlatans Paul had exposed ? If that kind of success made him look effective , well , so be it . But after decades of espionage , Ranold had to be more astute than he was letting on . On the other hand , Paul 's father-in-law had seemed to flip from bemusement to real respect when Paul had been honored after being blinded in action . They 'd had their ups and downs since , but it appeared Ranold looked for reasons to be proud of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the new Paul . She was grateful , no question . They had not raised their voices to each other in weeks . She had almost talked herself into believing that-while he had been unfaithful to her in the past and deserved whatever she dished out-perhaps her more recent suspicions were unfounded . He seemed to be trying to prove he had changed , and now his attitude-toward her at least-appeared truly different . He had helped get the kids to bed and kissed her good night as she settled in to wait for him , all the while knowing that her father expected him and her brother in the den . Those sessions seldom went smoothly , and the addition of Berlitz did not bode well . Big brother was the type of guy who frustrated the daylights out of an overachiever like Paul . In the past they had merely tolerated each other , so Jae had been surprised during the flight from Chicago when Paul had expressed actual eagerness to see Berlitz again . " Really ? " she said . " Why ? " " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His weird way , you mean . " " You said it , Jae . Not me . " " I know Berlitz is a strange bird , " she said , " but I love him . " " And that 's reason enough for me to as well . " Jae had cocked her head at Paul . " What ? " he said . " You love Berlitz too ? " " And your parents , because I love you . " " And your name again is- ? " He acted playfully hurt , but she sensed he had been sincere . How did that happen ? Paul had always displayed good manners with her , acted chivalrous , did the things a husband was supposed to do in public . But she could always read in his look and body language that his motive was guilt over indiscretions or simply a sense of duty . Or he had just been doing what he had to do to keep the peace . Heaven knew she often made him work for it . But this trip , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been since their return from California . Frankly , she found it disconcerting . It was n't that any weakness revealed itself . He was n't throwing aside his maleness . He was being a different kind of man , not too big to keep an eye on the kids , help with the luggage , take charge by serving her , doing for her . It had made her want to do her part too . She recalled many times having stood waiting , giving him an expectant stare as if silently demanding to know whether he was going to shoulder his part of the load or let her do everything . It was no wonder he seemed to do it begrudgingly . But now she did n't have to wait or wonder , and thus there was no need for the look . Upon landing he was out of the seat , reaching overhead for her stuff , corralling Connor , advising Brie , getting them from the plane and onto the road in the rental car without incident . Maybe his new friend Straight was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his relationship with Straight , restricting their time together to when the kids were in bed and any other family responsibilities had been met . Straight seemed to enjoy playing with the kids for a few minutes before he and Paul settled in for some chess . Jae appreciated that now they played late at night if at all . Once she had overheard Straight exhorting Paul to treat his wife the way he wanted to be treated . Of course she wanted Paul to do that on his own , but whatever it took . Straight had been responsible for the loss of his own entire family , so perhaps the motivation behind his counsel was grief and regret . But his words reaped benefits in Jae 's family , and one day she would have to tell Straight that . She also knew that one of the contributors to a better marriage and home life was that since Paul 's Las Vegas and California assignments , he had been home more . Jae did n't expect that to last . He had become a prize , in demand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she would enjoy his being home at reasonable hours . And if he could keep up this new attitude , she would resolve to give him the benefit of the doubt when he was away . It all made Jae more than ambivalent about the shocking discovery she kept to herself in a safety deposit box at Park Ridge Fidelity in the Chicago suburbs . When Jae heard weary footsteps on the stairs at her parents ' home that Wintermas , she hoped it was n't Paul knocking off early because of some offense by either her father or brother . She heard the tinkling of ice in a glass as the unsteady gait moved past her door . Peeking out , she saw it was Berlitz . " Little sister , " he said , seeming to force a smile . " Hey , Berl , " she said . " You guys solve all the problems of the world already ? " He stopped and leaned against the wall , as if weary . His eyes were bloodshot , which they had not been at dinner . Jae had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clearly he was n't holding his liquor well that night . Of course , Daddy stocked only the good stuff . A shot or two of that was like a whole bottle of anything else . " Ah , " he said . " You know Dad . I am one of the problems of his world . Always comparin ' me to Paul . Paul this and Paul that . " Jae knitted her brow . " He did that with Paul there ? " " Not in so many words . C'm on . You know how he is . Oozing disgust for the no-account son . " " That must 've made Paul terribly uncomfortable . " " Paul ? What about me ? I was the target . Paul is the model . " " But Paul did n't contribute , did he ? That does n't sound like him . " Berlitz took a sip and sloshed the liquid in circles in the glass . " Paul 's all right , you know ? I 've always liked him . He must think I'm- " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When he squinted she said , " He does ! He told me on the way here he was eager to see you again . " Berlitz swore with admiration . " For real ? " She nodded . " And I like your new wife too . " " Do ya ? I 'm not sure I do yet . " " What ? You- " " I 'm not sayin ' I do n't love her and all that , Jae . But loving and liking are two different things . She 's starting to get quiet all the time , like Mom , like she 's just tolerating me . " " Well , that 's more than you can say for your first two choices . " " Do n't remind me . " He muttered a label for them under his breath . " Sorry . " " Frankly , I ca n't argue . Never liked either of them . " " But you like this one ? Honest ? " " I do . " In truth , Jae just hoped Aryana would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an okay guy if he would just focus on his work and his relationships . When she was little he 'd been a good brother-protective , parental in many ways . Then it became clear that he was not going to be the kind of son her father had hoped for , someone who would follow in his footsteps . Daddy had been unfair in that , she concluded . Berlitz would never be his father , and she wished Ranold could accept that . As she returned to bed , grateful Paul had found reason to stay and talk with her father , she had to chuckle at her own brother 's name . It was her father 's mother 's maiden name , but still ... to lay that on an unsuspecting son and expect him to deal with it his whole life . Well , it spoke volumes about her father . When Paul finally came to bed , he closed the door quietly and changed in the dark , as if he thought Jae was asleep . " You survived ? " she said . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was okay . Your dad 's exercised about how soft the government and the agency have become . And poor Berlitz . He 'll never measure up . He bailed early . " " Could n't you encourage him , Paul ? " " I could try . I do n't want to offend him though . He 's older than I am , you know . " Who was this sensitive , new man ? Jae loved him . Continues ...
