Richmond , Surrey <p> Late April 1824 <p> Dear Charlotte , <p> How thoughtless of your drawing instructor to quit just before the Easter term begins ! At least you have Miss Seton to help you until you can replace the irresponsible woman . Though I do hope she has grown out of what you called " her inability to think before speaking . " <p> Your friend and cousin , <p> Michael <p> Lucinda Seton needed an impressive suitor , and she needed one now . <p> A prince would be her first choice , but she 'd settle for a duke or even a marquess , preferably one who was filthy rich . <p> Not that she cared about riches , oh no . Expensive phaetons tearing neck-or-nothing through town made her retch , and hothouse roses made her sneeze . Jewels were rather nice , but a lot of trouble to watch out for when strolling with one 's maid in the parks . <p> No , she wanted an impressive suitor for one reason only : to make Peter Burnes eat his words . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mrs. Harris 's School for Young Ladies that would be hers for the next few weeks . Fie on that wretch ! She jerked a shawl from her half-unpacked trunk . How could she still be crying over him ? And how could that heartless blackguard choose some milk-and-water miss over her ? <p> The memory of their humiliating exchange at last Saturday 's ball made her cringe as she tucked her shawl into the chest of drawers . Bad enough that she 'd foolishly asked him how they stood . But his answer ... <p> Given my new position in society , Lucy , I require a more suitable wife . Someone of a settled and responsible disposition , not a hot-blooded hoyden who says the first thing that pops into her head . <p> Hunting through her trunk , she found her pencils and the sketch pad containing the drawing she 'd done of him a year ago , back when he 'd thought she might be a suitable wife . She stared at the tousled curls and beatific smile that always made her heart turn over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was n't an irresponsible hoyden . She was n't ! <p> All right , perhaps she was a trifle outspoken . But what was wrong with that ? He 'd enjoyed it well enough when they were children running about the regiment . <p> You 're the kind of woman a man dallies with , not the kind he marries . <p> Dallies with ! She gnawed on her pencil , remembering the first time Peter , a seventeen-year-old general 's son three years older than she , had laughingly stolen a kiss from her . Had he been dallying even then ? Had she assumed it meant something when it had meant nothing to him ? <p> And after she 'd waited months for him , too ! She 'd been so sure Peter would marry her . Before his departure on the Grand Tour , he 'd even called her his " one true love . " He 'd kissed her again , so sweetly it had seemed a declaration , especially when he 'd told her to wait for him . <p> But once he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd called on her dressed in costly splendor , sporting a fine gold watch and talking down to her . <p> You 're too impassioned , too curious about things no lady should deign to notice . You ca n't help it  --  it 's in your blood . <p> Her foreign blood . Peter knew that Lucy had been adopted by Colonel Seton , the man she called Papa . Her real father had been an English soldier , her mother a Spanish woman of uncertain background . Not that Lucy could remember , since they 'd died in the war when Lucy was only four . <p> But Peter did n't care about that , did he ? Oh no , he only cared about the precious blood that her mother had passed on , which he seemed to think seethed with Spanish wildness and passion and fire . <p> Well , she 'd show him wildness and passion and fire ! With quick slashes of her pencil , she added a pointy tail that curved out from behind the modest frock coat he 'd worn back when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inherited the earldom of Hunforth . <p> That 's when he 'd become " too good " for her , too conscious of his precious lineage and important connections . That 's when he 'd become exactly like every other man in English society . <p> Although most people assumed Papa was a widower and Lucy his daughter , they soon learned otherwise from the gossips . Lady Kerr , her stepmother , had gently warned her that her odd parentage might prove an issue for high sticklers , especially since she was n't a great heiress like her friends . And though men had shown her some interest during her first season , she 'd had no offers . Not that she 'd encouraged them  --  she 'd been waiting for Peter . But she would have thought one would have made an offer anyway . <p> Unless ... Oh , Lord , what if Peter were right about her ? What if everybody thought she was some hussy not good enough to become a respectable man 's wife ? Was that why men were always eyeing her bosom and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do that to the other girls . <p> They certainly never did that to Lady Juliana . Rich , elegant , boring Lady Juliana , whom Peter had apparently chosen as sufficiently suitable to be his bride . <p> Fresh tears sprang to her eyes . How dared he spurn her ? The other men did n't surprise her ; half were sheep who did what their mamas said . But Peter was supposed to be ... <p> Hers . <p> She 'd make him rue the day he 'd rejected her . She had started to sketch a knife protruding from his treacherous heart when a knock came at the door . Hastily , she thrust the sketch pad beneath a pillow and bade the person enter . <p> Her stepmother glided into the room with her usual grace , another trait Lucy lacked . " Your father has finished his discussion with Mrs. Harris . " Lady Kerr , who 'd been married to Papa for little more than a year , surveyed the harum-scarum pile of clothing on the bed . " So we 're leaving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll be along shortly . " <p> Lady Kerr glanced at the open trunk . " Shall I help you unpack first ? " <p> " I do n't need your help ! " Lucy snapped , then regretted it when Lady Kerr flinched . Lucy softened her tone . " It 's kind of you to offer , but I can handle it alone . There 's no reason for you to alter your plans . " <p> Lady Kerr 's halfhearted smile pricked Lucy 's conscience . The woman had tried hard to be her friend . Papa had even hinted at how much it would mean to Lady Kerr to have Lucy call her Mother , but Lucy could n't bring herself to do it . She chafed at Lady Kerr 's constant reminders to lower her voice and mind her tongue and not laugh at men 's rough jokes . If all a mother did was chide , perhaps she was better off without one . <p> At least Lady Kerr improved Papa 's life . Though she did n't always approve of his blustering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him , too , strong and calm to balance his impetuous nature , and never daunted by the addlebrained things he did when distracted . Lady Kerr would make certain he did n't forget his hat . <p> Of course , managing Papa had been Lucy 's job until she 'd left for school . She missed that  --  and the dinners when he 'd spun tales of India or the evenings when she 'd practiced her sums for his approval . Life had been simple then . <p> A sigh escaped her . <p> As usual , Lady Kerr mistook it . " You do n't have to stay . Your father and I would love to have you go with us to meet Venetia in Edinburgh . Surely another instructor can teach drawing until Mrs. Harris can replace the teacher who quit . " <p> Lucy returned to unpacking . " Actually , I look forward to the teaching . Edinburgh is such a bore , and I should stay busy until the Season is in full swing . " <p> And she needed to show Peter Burnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her levelheaded behavior as a teacher , he would grovel at her feet , admitting he 'd been wrong and begging her forgiveness . <p> She might forgive him . She might not . But she could do neither if she were stuck up north while he pranced about town with Lady Juliana . <p> Taking her stepmother 's arm , Lucy guided her toward the door . " You should go . You know how Papa is about waiting . " Besides , she wanted them both off so she could wallow in her misery . <p> They walked down in silence to find Papa pacing before the stairs . When he heard them and looked up , his irritation altered instantly to pleasure . <p> Most of it was for Lady Kerr . And the countess 's blush further illustrated their bond . <p> A painful yearning pierced Lucy . Would a man ever look at her like that and make her blush ? Even Peter had n't managed that . She was n't the blushing sort . <p> " There 's my lassies ! " Papa boomed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't civilized out of him . " Come now , Maggie , no dawdling . We must make haste while the weather is fine , eh , Lucy ? " <p> " No rain is our gain , " Lucy parroted his oft-used remark , left over from her childhood in Spain and Portugal during the war , when long marches in bad weather meant pure misery . <p> " You 're all settled , then ? " he asked Lucy as Lady Kerr took his arm . <p> Papa and Lady Kerr were going off together . Without her . It was all she could do to manage a smile . " I 'm fine . " <p> With a frown , he looked her over . " You do n't look fine to me . It 's that idiot Peter Burnes , is n't it ? " <p> She blinked . " How did you  --  " <p> " I 'm no fool , lass . I know ye had yer heart set on him , and I saw yer face when he and that snooty Lady Juliana @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always thought him a bit of a fribble , but I never took him for a fool until now . Ye 're better off without him , d' you hear ? " He chucked her under the chin . " Do n't be wasting another thought on that jackanapes . " <p> The fact that her unobservant Papa had noticed what had gone on between her and Peter was so unexpectedly sweet she burst into tears . <p> He stood frozen in shock until Lady Kerr nudged him . Then he hastily drew Lucy into his arms . " There , now , lass , did n't mean to make you cry . It 's not so bad as all that , is it ? Sh , sh , hush now . " <p> The familiar scent of Guard 's Bouquet on his collar calmed her , reminding her that he was still her dear Papa , no matter whom he 'd married . <p> Lady Kerr held out a handkerchief , and Lucy took it gratefully , casting her stepmother a tremulous smile as she dabbed at her eyes and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady Kerr said , " we 'd be happy to have you come with us . " <p> The kind remark nearly brought back Lucy 's tears , but she stifled them ruthlessly . When had she become such a watering pot ? <p> Steadying her shoulders , she pulled away . " I ca n't . I need to keep busy , and Mrs. Harris could use the help . I 'll be fine . Really , I will . " <p> " We 'll be back in three weeks , " Papa said , " but if you need us sooner , just send word . " <p> " Thank you , Papa . " Lucy kissed his cheek , then , on impulse , kissed Lady Kerr 's . The bright smile she received in return made her wish she had n't been so sharp with her earlier . " I 'll miss you both , " she said , and truly meant it . <p> She accompanied them to the coach and followed it to the end of the drive . As she strolled back , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more tears , and she was sick of crying . <p> She made a sharp turn and headed across to the blooming cherry orchard that separated the school from its neighboring estate , Rockhurst . According to Mrs. Harris , Mr. Pritchard had been trying to sell it , but no one would meet his exorbitant price , since the house was nearly beyond repair . So Rockhurst had lain vacant for the past three months , which was why she felt free to wander into its orchard . <p> As she entered the trees , a breeze sent blossoms tumbling about her like snowflakes , and her heart lightened . Unable to resist the enticement , she kicked off her kidskin slippers and began to twirl amidst the falling blossoms as she 'd done when she was a girl . The more she twirled , the less her heart ached . Her hair pulled loose from its pins to fall about her , twirling with her . <p> For the first time in days , she felt free to be herself , without Peter 's nasty words taking her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make another turn , she threw herself to the ground . Tucking her hands beneath her head , she stared up at the branches and lifted her face to the blossoms drifting gently onto her gown . <p> If only life could always be like this , just cherry blossoms and spring . Or even as it was during her blissful student days here , when she and the other girls learned geography and the waltz and how men could deceive you  --  <p> A sigh escaped her . She should have heeded those lessons . Instead , she 'd let her imagination run away with her , soaking up the nonsense in that scandalous book of harem 's tales she and the girls had read in secret . She 'd convinced herself that one day she and Peter would marry and try ... all those ... naughty ... things ... <p> The previous night 's tear-torn sleep caught up with her , and she fell into a doze . She was dreaming of a harem where the women were in charge and the sultan had to do their bidding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What have we here ? A local lady come to welcome me to the neighborhood ? Or a goddess descended from Mount Olympus to sport with a mere mortal ? " <p> Lucy 's eyes shot open . Was she still dreaming ? The devilishly handsome man standing at her feet could easily be a sultan , with his olive skin and eyes the color of roasted almonds . He 'd clearly just come from a bath , for his glossy black hair lay damp on his neck . Shockingly , he wore only a white shirt tucked into black pantaloons tucked into a pair of top boots , with no waistcoat , coat , or cravat . <p> She had to be dreaming . No man hereabouts would leave his house in shirtsleeves . Or leave his shirt open at the throat to reveal a smattering of chest hair . Or wear pantaloons so tight they showed every well-defined muscle in his thighs . He was such a delicious specimen of manliness that he fairly took her breath away . <p> Meanwhile , his gaze slid down her body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her breasts before moving to where her gown dipped between her parted legs . After casting her stocking feet a pointed look , he smiled , his thin black mustache quirking up . <p> " A goddess , most assuredly , " he said in faintly accented English . " No local seorita would walk about without her shoes . " <p> Seorita ? Oh , no . He was n't her dream sultan . He was very real . And foreign . And a complete stranger . <p> Belatedly , she scrambled to a sitting position . Lord , what must he think of her ? Before she could struggle to stand , he held out his hand . She hesitated half a second before taking it , although the moment she was on her feet , she snatched her hand free . <p> A chuckle escaped him . " I should beg your pardon for disturbing your siesta , but I do not regret it . You make an enchanting picture lying in the cherry blossoms . " <p> His amusement sparked her temper . " Who are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ property ? " <p> He arched one finely groomed black brow . " I could ask the same of you . " <p> " I 'm a teacher at the school that adjoins this orchard . " She smoothed her skirt , trying to make herself look more teacherly . It was woefully hard to do with her hair tumbled down about her waist . <p> " Ah , yes , the girls ' academy . " He cast her a speculative glance . " But that is what you are , not who . What is your name ? " <p> Oh , dear , she was n't supposed to be here , and if he were to mention it to Mrs. Harris ... " I sha n't give my name to a stranger . Especially when you have n't given me yours . You are the intruder here . " <p> " Intruder ! What a suspicious little thing you are , " he said without rancor . " As it happens , you already know my name . It 's on my calling card . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't seen your calling card . If you left it with our schoolmistress  --  " <p> " No need to dissemble , seorita . You have it right there . " He reached up to pull something from behind her ear , then held it out with a flourish . <p> Caught off guard , she took the gilt-edged calling card from him . " How did you ... " She trailed off as she read the printed card . <p> Diego Javier Montalvo , Master of Mystery . <p> Master of Mystery ? She lifted her gaze to him , seeing nothing in his half-smile to enlighten her . It did n't sound like anything a normal person would put on a card . It almost sounded like ... <p> The truth dawned . " Oh , Lord , you 're a magician . " <p> " Indeed , I am . " He gave her a mock frown . " You do n't seem very pleased to hear it . " <p> Hardly ! She had a weakness for magicians  --  their swirling black capes , their intriguing smiles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coupled with her weakness for devastatingly handsome Continental gentlemen , Diego Javier Montalvo was the perfect temptation . <p> But Peter would never eat his words if he learned she 'd been flirting with a stranger . <p> " Why is a magician wandering around Rockhurst ? " she demanded . As a teacher , she would be most irresponsible if she did n't find out . <p> " Are you worried I have come to steal your neighbor 's valuables ? " <p> " Have you ? " she asked archly . <p> That made him grin . " I would hardly tell you if I had . " The words rolled off his tongue melodically , turning her knees to butter . <p> None of that ! she chided herself as she glanced about for her shoes , which were nowhere to be seen . You must be responsible . Mature . Not swayed by good-looking men . Not the sort of woman a man only dallies with . <p> " Perhaps I am here to steal something else . " His voice had turned calculating . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> She burst into laughter . That sort of nonsense she could handle perfectly well . " Do you rehearse such compliments when you rehearse your tricks ? Or do flatteries simply come naturally to you ? " <p> He looked genuinely surprised . " You are very jaded for one so young . " <p> " Young ! I 'll have you know I 'm more than twenty years old . " <p> His eyes seemed to mock her . " Ah , then you are clearly a woman of the world . My mistake . " <p> She crossed her arms over her chest . " I 'm certainly worldly enough to tell when a man is trying to turn me up sweet for his own purposes . " <p> Some unreadable emotion swept his angular features . " And what purposes would those be ? " <p> " I have no clue . " She blew out an exasperated breath . " You still have n't told me what you 're doing here . " <p> " Very well , if you must know , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shock kept her motionless . " Oh , dear , " she murmured , mortified anew . <p> Laughter glinted in his gaze . " So you see , Seorita Schoolteacher , you are the intruder . I saw you from the window upstairs as I was dressing and came down to learn who was invading my property . " He reached up to pluck a leaf from her disordered hair . " Now will you allow me the pleasure of your name ? " <p> Definitely not . For one thing , just the brush of his fingers over her hair had already quickened her pulse most dangerously . For another , it would be a great deal easier for him to complain of her to Mrs. Harris if he knew her name . " I-I did n't think the house was even habitable . " <p> " It will suffice until I decide if I want to buy the estate . " <p> But were n't conjurers nomads , living in inns and lodging houses ? He was too young to retire , and even London theaters could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size of Rockhurst . " What would you do with it ? " <p> His gaze grew shuttered . " It depends . " <p> Something in his evasive manner sparked her concern . " On what ? " <p> " Whether it and its environs meet my stringent requirements . " <p> Its environs ? Did he mean the school ? " What sort of requirements ? Surely , once it is put into shape , Rockhurst would be sufficient for your family . " <p> " I am not married . " He cocked his head , dropping one raven lock over his eye , then smoothed it back with the nonchalance of a man sure of his exotic appeal . " And you ? Does your position as a teacher mean you have no husband ? " <p> She caught herself before answering . " Why are you avoiding my question ? " <p> " For the same reason you are avoiding mine , I would imagine . " His eyes gleamed with mischief . " To prolong this intriguing conversation . " <p> A laugh bubbled up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , I find it less intriguing than frustrating . You are purposely being mysterious . " <p> " As are you , Seorita Schoolteacher . Indeed , your reluctance to divulge your identity fascinates me . " He bent his head close enough that she caught a whiff of soap and hair oil . " You stand in my orchard and interrogate me bold as brass , yet you will not tell me something as small as your name . Are you hiding a secret ? Acting as a spy ? " Seeing the smile rise to her lips despite her struggle to prevent it , he lowered his voice to a throaty murmur . " Waiting for a lover , perhaps ? " <p> She jerked back as an unfamiliar heat rose in her cheeks . Good Lord , did she give off some scent that led people to make assumptions about her character ? <p> Then again , he had found her shamelessly lolling about on the ground of his orchard . She would have to set him straight . <p> " That 's a very impertinent suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Especially when we have n't been properly introduced . " <p> A slow smile curved up his finely carved lips . " And do such trivialities matter to you , cario ? " <p> Cario ? Oh , but that was too wicked of him . Her Spanish was rusty , but she did remember that cario was an endearment . A trill of pleasure skirled along her nerves . He should never have used it with her , whether he thought she understood it or not . And she certainly should n't let it do funny things to her insides . <p> She answered sharply , " This is not the Continent , sir . ' Such trivialities ' matter to everyone in England . So if you hope for success in your ventures here , you 'd best start showing some concern for propriety yourself . " <p> Her remark darkened his gaze to a dangerous glitter . " I forgot how obsessed you English are with propriety , " he bit out . " Except , of course , when you are invading other people 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for that . And she 'd been rude indeed to point out his improprieties when she 'd been the one trespassing . Though she could n't fathom why it angered him now , when he had n't seemed to care earlier . <p> " Forgive me for intruding , " she said , wanting to escape with her dignity  --  and identity  --  intact . " I must go . " <p> She whirled toward the school but had taken only two steps before he called out , " Are n't you forgetting something ? " <p> When she looked back , he was dangling her slippers from two fingers , his features smoothed into a charming mask once more . <p> " Thank you , sir , " she murmured , but when she reached for the shoes , he held them out of reach , easy enough for him to do with his great height . <p> " Your name , seorita , " he said softly , a smug smile playing over his lips . <p> She hesitated , weighing her choices . But there was none . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ran . <p> Better to lose her slippers than have him inform Mrs. Harris of her shameless behavior . If Peter should hear how she 'd reclined on the ground like a " hot-blooded hoyden " while some stranger looked her over , she 'd simply die . As long as Seor Montalvo did n't know her name , this incident need never reach anyone . Their paths were n't likely to cross again . <p> Still , she wanted to warn Mrs. Harris about the man . It would n't do to have the girls trailing after him like lovesick puppies . Besides , something was n't right . Why would a magician rent an estate the size of Rockhurst just for himself ? <p> If she had n't been so busy reacting to his flirtations , she might have pressed him for more information . But when he 'd cast his hot gaze down her body and had spoken Spanish endearments in a voice of warm honey ... <p> Lord help her . Continental gentlemen were the worst . Or the best , depending on how one looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's blood . <p> Perhaps Peter was right about her , after all . <p> She frowned . All right , she found the foreigner appealing , but he was a performer , for pity 's sake . He made love to the audience every night  --  he 'd honed his abilities for years . Of course she was tempted . What living , breathing female would n't be , when a man that sinfully attractive looked at her like that ? <p> Peter 's new love would n't . Lady Juliana would be appalled . <p> Gritting her teeth , Lucy cut through the garden while twisting her hair up in a knot . She 'd best pray she never saw him again . She was much too susceptible to his charms . <p> She 'd nearly reached the steps to the entrance when a female voice asked , " Feel better now , dear ? " <p> Startled , she whirled to find Mrs. Harris sitting at a table , reading the newspaper . " What do you mean ? " Lucy asked guiltily . <p> " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said without looking up . <p> " Oh . " She relaxed . " Yes . " <p> Itching to get inside before Mrs. Harris noticed her missing shoes and disordered hair , she hurried forward . But the schoolmistress 's cry of alarm stopped her short . <p> " What is it ? " Lucy hastened back , all thought of her own disarray banished by the woman 's stricken expression . <p> Shaking her head , Mrs. Harris finished scanning an article in the paper . When she threw down the paper with an unladylike oath , Lucy grabbed it up . Front and center was the headline , " Magician to Build Pleasure Garden in Richmond . " <p> Curse it  --  she 'd known that smooth scoundrel was up to something ! She greedily read the article as Mrs. Harris rose to pace the flagstone walk . <p> " He means to turn Rockhurst into another Vauxhall ! " Mrs. Harris exclaimed . " Can you imagine ? It 's a disaster ! Pickpockets hiding in the orchard , watermen lounging on our river landing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midnight . The girls will never be able to sleep . Not to mention the scandalous goings-on that always occur at such places at night . " <p> Between the article and Mrs. Harris 's outraged recitation , Lucy gleaned the facts . Apparently , the twenty-eight-year-old Diego Montalvo was no ordinary conjurer . He was famous all over the world , performing his tricks to great acclaim before the kings of Sweden and Denmark . He 'd even spent a year touring Russia , impressing the tsar with his astonishing illusions . <p> Now the talented fellow had come to England to raze the house next door and build a public place of amusement . Good Lord . <p> Mrs. Harris paced in increasing agitation . " I do n't even allow my girls to visit Vauxhall strictly chaperoned . How am I to protect them with a Vauxhall rising practically at our very steps ? " <p> Lucy glanced over at Rockhurst . She 'd heard of the licentious activities occurring in Vauxhall 's darkened walks while the magicians and orchestras performed . And judging from Seor Montalvo 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly the sort of place he would establish . <p> No wonder he 'd been so mysterious . The devious wretch was worse than Peter , dallying with her even as he plotted against the school she loved . <p> " I must write Cousin Michael at once , " Mrs. Harris said . " He will know how to stop this . " She whirled toward the steps , then halted to glare at the other property . " I swear , I shall have Mr. Pritchard 's head . He has gone too far this time , bringing such trouble into our midst ! " <p> Indeed , it would mean the end of the school . <p> Never ! Lucy could n't stand by and watch everything Mrs. Harris had worked for be destroyed with such careless disregard . This school meant too much to too many , including her . She would n't let Seor Montalvo get away with this . She was tired of men trampling over her and her friends . <p> Somehow , she 'd show that scheming magician that he could n't transform @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then , after saving the school , she would make Peter eat his words about her being an irresponsible hoyden . Just see if she did n't . <p> Copyright 2009 by Deborah Gonzales <br> Continues ...
