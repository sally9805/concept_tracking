Emotional Wreck The Padres and a close former teammate try to come to grips with Mike Darr 's death // The Shiny , new white GMC Yukon caught Ben Davis 's attention , but not as much as the familiar smile and easy laugh of the man behind the wheel , Padres outfielder Mike Darr . Davis had played with Darr for five seasons in the San Diego organization until the Padres traded Davis , a catcher , to the Mariners on Dec. 11 . Late last Thursday afternoon , having left his home in suburban Philadelphia and flown to Phoenix for the start of spring training , Davis happened upon his close friend in the parking lot of the apartment complex at which they would live while their teams shared a spring training base in nearby Peoria. // The two strapping young men jumped out of their vehicles and hugged each other . Maybe , Dan-mentioned , Davis could join him for something to eat later . A travel-weary Davis said no , but added , " We 'll definitely hook up soon . " // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , bro . " Darr called everybody bro . When Davis would tell him to wear his seat belt while riding in Davis 's car , Darr would reply , " Nah , do n't worry . I 'm all right , bro. " // There would be plenty of opportunities , Davis assumed , to hook up with Darr . " I never thought , " Davis says , " that would be the last time I saw him . " // On Friday at about 2 a.m. , driving on Highway 101 only a few miles from his apartment , Darr lost control of the Yukon . In the passenger seat was Duane L. Johnson , 24 , of Reno , a friend of Darr 's . Ben Howard , 23 , a rising pitching prospect in the Padres system , was in the back . The Yukon swerved left onto the dirt median , then quickly darted right , sending the SUV into a roll . It tumbled across the traffic lanes , plowed through a chain-link fence and came to rest upside down on a service road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 26 on March 21 , and Johnson were dead . Neither had been wearing a seat belt and both were thrown from the vehicle . Howard , who had belted himself in , walked away with only minor scratches and bruises . Frank Valenzuela , a spokesman for the Arizona Department of Public Safety , said that the accident appeared to be alcohol-related. // The baseball season officially began for many teams , including the Mariners , later that morning with the first workouts for pitchers and catchers . Davis , who will turn 25 on March 10 , held back tears as Seattle manager Lou Piniella , in his welcoming address , stressed the importance of safety and seat belts . " We talk about it every spring , " Piniella said after the meeting , " but today we went a step further . " // Darr left behind a wife , Natalie , and two young sons , Mike Jr . and Matthew . A fourth outfielder blessed with speed and boundless enthusiasm , the 6 ' 3 " , 205-pound Darr hit .277 with two home runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his third with the Padres . During his five years in the organization he personified the spirit of a youthful , scrappy outfit . Once , in the minor leagues , an injured Darr was sitting in the training room wearing only sliding shorts hiked to his hips , ice packs strapped on his hamstrings and shower sandals when a brawl erupted on the field . A nearly naked Dan-bolted onto the field to join the fray . " At one point the fight just kind of came to a halt because nobody could believe what he was doing , " Davis says . // Only seven months ago the Padres lost a top pitching prospect , righthander Gerik Baxter , in another auto accident . Now they must continue with an encouraging rebuilding program after losing one of their most beloved players . Moreover , the organization will closely monitor Howard , the survivor . " Physically , he 's absolutely fine , " Padres manager Bruce Bochy said last Friday . " It 's the psychological part you worry about . " // Davis , meanwhile , says , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to put this behind me . " The second overall pick in the 1995 draft , he spent his first full season in the majors last year , batting .239 with 11 home runs and 57 RBIs in 138 games . San Diego , though , preferred the defensive skills of Wild Gonzalez and used Davis to fill a need at shortstop , acquiring Ramon Vazquez in the trade with Seattle . // Davis 's attitude was questioned in 1999 when , in a tiff about playing time , he refused to warm up a pitcher in the bullpen . But last year " Ben really matured and did everything we asked of him and more , " Bochy says . " I see him being an All-Star . He has that kind of ability . " // Piniella says that incumbent Dan Wilson remains his primary catcher , though Davis , a 6 ' 4 " , 215-pound switch-hitter , could play his way into a larger role . The Mariners ' manager says that he is " excited to have him here "  --  especially in the wake of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make you think , " Piniella says . " What if Ben had joined them for dinner ? What if he was in the car ? He was such a close friend , maybe he would have been in the front seat . " // A funeral service was scheduled for Wednesday in Darr 's hometown of Corona , Calif . The Padres arranged to fly the entire team there . Davis asked for and received permission from the Mariners to be there to say a final goodbye to his bro. // Phillies ' Mike Lieberthal No Yogi , but Plenty of Yoga // The most welcome sight for Phillies manager Larry Bowa last Friday , the first day of workouts for his pitchers and catchers , was Mike Lieberthal squatting in a practice bullpen , on the receiving end of staff ace Robert Person 's first 15-minute throwing session . Last year Lieberthal 's season ended on May 12 , when he collapsed in a heap on the base paths at Bank One Ballpark with a torn right anterior cruciate ligament . The Phillies won 86 games and finished a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East without their two-time All-Star catcher , so Lieberthal 's return is eagerly anticipated . " Everyone says we only got one free agent over the winter , " says Bowa , referring to righthanded starter Terry Adams . " But I say getting Mike back is like getting another player . " // That 's assuming the 30-year-old Lieberthal is able to return to form eight months after having a cadaver 's tendon grafted to his knee . After the first day of camp in Clearwater , Fla. , he said he felt " pretty close " to being able to go at full speed and that he expected to be completely comfortable well before Opening Day . // Lieberthal credits a rigorous rehab and off-season workout program for his return . He had a batting cage installed in the backyard of his home in Thousand Oaks , Calif. , and hit regularly during the winter . As he said after BP last Friday , " These are n't my first swings of the year . " He also exceeded his preinjury levels of strength and flexibility with twice-weekly sessions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I always had tight hamstrings , tight legs , " Lieberthal says . " All that stretching allows me to have the strength from weights and still gain flexibility . "  --  Stephen Cannella
