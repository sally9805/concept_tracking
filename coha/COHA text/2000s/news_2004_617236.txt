<p> Q : Do I really need a travel agent if I can easily book a trip or vacation on the Internet ? <p> A : Booking a simple round-trip ticket on the Net is a no-brainer now that airlines provide easy , direct links to complete a purchase . The same is true with Internet-only hotel and auto rental specials on popular travel sites . <p> However , you could be overpaying and not being made aware of other low offers on the Web . How do you find out ? An easy-to-download program at SideStep.com searches dozens of sites at once ( 585 airlines , 40,000 hotels and 2,800 rental car locations , including Web-only fares ) for the best deals worldwide ( your computer must have MS Microsoft Windows and Internet Explorer to download the program ) . When SideStep detects you are price surfing for air , hotel or car rental rates , the system automatically displays a wide variety of quotes on a small portion of your monitor . If you prefer a rate shown on SideStep , a direct link will take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reminded when you book on the Internet : Are you fully informed of all terms and conditions of your purchase ? Do you understand the terms ( i.e. , on refunds , changes , cancellations , modifications ) ? Can you speak with a representative of the company during a trip if you are delayed , bumped or canceled ? Do not rely on oral promises from employees at toll-free numbers . Make a copy of the terms and conditions , as they are subject to frequent changes . <p> A travel agent can still provide expert service before , during and after a trip and is a key ally to rely on when things go wrong or are not delivered as purchased . The extra service fees you may pay can be justified by considering the expert advice on what to expect from a trip , preparation for your destination and obtaining the best ways to maximize your travel days and dollars . <p> Q : How do I find a good travel agent ? <p> A : The American Society of Travel Agents ( www.astanet.com ) is a respected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Member agencies subscribe to a multipoint code of ethics and stake their reputations on providing customers with the highest services . Your ZIP code entry will locate a member agency in your neighborhood . <p> Personal recommendations from colleagues or friends are also valuable . Both the agent and the customer should openly discuss what is expected from each side and discuss fees so as to avoid surprises or disappointments . <p> Q : Who can I complain to if my vacation turns into a disaster ? <p> A : Effective complaints should result in righting a wrong . Overwhelmingly , travelers are dissatisfied with the responses to their complaints . That 's because a vacation is usually a much anticipated , once-a-year event that ca n't be repeated . <p> Most complaints can be avoided if a traveler is fully informed before a trip starts . For example , most air travel delays , cancellations and disrupted schedules are unavoidable , and major airlines are under no federal requirement to provide customers with certain entitlements when these situations occur . It 's up to each of us to know individual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Air ) . It never hurts to ask an airline for a prepaid phone calling card and/or a meal voucher for weather-related delays . <p> When delays are a result of mechanical problems , phone the airline ( do n't stand in the long lines ) and ask to be re-accommodated on another carrier . It pays to do your homework in advance so you know which carriers serve your destination , along with alternative flight times . <p> The U.S. Department of Transportation 's Aviation Consumer Protection Division details customer rights at www.dot.gov/airconsumer . It also accepts airline-related complaints via e-mail to airconsumer@ost.dot.gov . However , this division does n't mediate individual complaints but compiles them for the monthly Air Travel Consumer Report . You can check these reports for complaints against the airlines and tour operators at www.dot.gov/airconsumer . <p> Still need to sound off ? You can find addresses for the major national and international airlines at www.dot.gov/airconsumer and **45;6829;TOOLONG . If your complaint letter is for a hotel , car rental agency or other travel industry member , direct it to the president of the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problem occurred . If you do n't receive a reply within 30 days , be prepared to follow up persistently . <p> When composing a complaint letter , leave out your emotions and state only the facts in one page or less . Suggest a realistic resolution , such as a replacement stay or a voucher to be used on a future flight . <p> If possible , attempt to solve your problem as it occurs , while remaining calm , reasonable and fair . <p> Q : Why is it sometimes hard to get the airfares listed or written about in the Travel section of the AJC ? <p> A : The weekly airfare list should be used as a key in determining the average rates to a destination . Occasionally , you may see a fare decrease , which indicates a published or Internet-only sale that is valid for one or two days beyond that Sunday . Checking the prices to a certain city over several weeks should give you a fair history of the average published price and published sale prices available directly from an airline or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a price is a deal and when it 's not . <p> If you can only get higher quotes than the sale price , it probably means that the seats allotted for that price are sold out for the dates you 've requested . Try adjusting your dates . <p> Q : How does a traveler pack smart for today 's security measures ? <p> A : My advice has n't wavered since new security measures were placed on airports worldwide . Determine the size limitations for a carry-on piece and travel with only that one piece of baggage ( in addition to one other item , such as a laptop , handbag , briefcase , diaper bag ) . If other necessary belongings ca n't fit in this one piece , ship the excess items via a ground service such as the U.S. Postal Service , UPS or FedEx . This speeds airport check-in time , since you can proceed directly to your gate area after security screening . <p> If you must check a bag , be sure that you place your name and all contact addresses inside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itinerary on the inside to aid in matching you up with a lost bag . This is also a good rule of thumb for carry-on pieces , in the event that you are instructed to check it at the last minute because of aircraft space constrictions . If this happens , remove all items of value to carry onboard . <p> Never check items of any value . This includes medicines , eyewear , important papers , cameras , electronics , jewelry , money , credit cards , passports , travel documents , gifts , your dress for the next day 's event , etc . Airlines are not responsible for the loss or replacement of these items . Compensation for lost baggage is limited to clothing ( proof of purchase is required or depreciated value is awarded ) . <p> The Federal Aviation Administration addresses a number of frequently asked questions involving airport and airline security issues , items permitted or not permitted on board aircraft and more at **32;6876;TOOLONG . <p> Q : Do I need trip insurance ? <p> A : If you ask yourself that question , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a policy . What if you must cancel a trip or cruise that has been paid in full and stiff penalties are in effect ? What happens if you 're away from home and you need to return home sooner than scheduled because of an emergency ? <p> A basic , inexpensive policy will protect your money should you need to cancel a trip before it begins ( or your trip is interrupted ) for a medical reason ( you or immediate family member ) or for other covered reasons . Premiums range from $6 to $8 per $100 worth of coverage . Insure only the portions of a trip or cruise that carry cancel/change penalties . <p> Be sure to compare policy benefits from one company to another . On the Web , some of the major companies are www.travel-guard.com ; www.travelsecure.com ; **26;6910;TOOLONG ; www.travelinsured.com ; www.accessamerica.com . <p> Never take out the trip cancel/interruption policy from the operator or cruise line you intend to travel with . Those plans often protect the travel supplier rather than the individual . Purchase your policy independently .

One of the most rampant is in the phony travel agent ID , referred to as a card mill scam . Consumers are told they can buy necessary credentials to become a travel agent ( typical cost : $500 ) and then they can get the lowest prices on airlines , hotels , trips and more . There are two reasons to stay far away from this one : Airlines and hotels have found ways to weed out fake agents , which denies consumers these so-called benefits ; and consumers have no way to get a refund if they 're dissatisfied . <p> Scams can come by way of telemarketers informing you that you 've won a free trip or by a pitch from a breathless salesperson telling you that you can have a lifetime of exotic travel if you pay a few thousand dollars upfront . Students , too , can be left high and dry after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that do n't deliver . <p> If a travel offer sounds too good to be true , you can visit the Federal Trade Commission Web site **48;6938;TOOLONG for more on consumer alerts involving vacations , time share rentals , student trips , telemarketing and other alerts . <p> Listen to your instincts . If you have doubts about a deal or offer , walk away . <p> * Clara Bosonetto is a retired travel consultant who also writes the Budget Update column in Wednesday 's Living section .
