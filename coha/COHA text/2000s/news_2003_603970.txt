<p> If the Boston Red Sox win the World Series this season , there 's only one title for the highlight video : Revenge of the Nerds , Part 5 . <p> John Henry , the Red Sox owner , is into quantitative analysis , using reams of numbers to make investment decisions . Henry hires stats-whiz general manager Theo Epstein , 29 , who dramatically restructures this year 's bullpen on the advice of author Bill James , whose computer simulations say conventional ninth-inning closers are a waste and not a necessary ingredient for a team to win . <p> " We are n't trying to set a trend , " says Epstein , so taken with the idea that he did n't re-sign 40-save closer Ugueth Urbina . " We are trying to win as many games as we can . I 'm sure we will hear about it if it does n't work . " <p> James ' books are bibles to fantasy-leaguers everywhere . Now his theories have a say in whether the Red Sox can beat the New York Yankees in the American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have real , live consequences to your suggestions , " James says . " We 'll test some things . It 's exciting , yet scary , because I could suggest a move that does n't work well . " <p> Stats people and the Red Sox are a lot alike . Stats people believe they do n't get proper respect in baseball . The Red Sox have n't won a World Series since 1918 . It 's time to think outside the box . <p> And they did , especially when you consider that in the last 10 years 52 of 72 postseason teams had a closer with at least 30 saves . Last October the Yankees were the only one of eight teams that did n't have such a closer , but that was because injuries limited Mariano Rivera to 28 saves . <p> The Red Sox 's restructured bullpen does away with the usual lefty-righty combinations that set up a ninth-inning closer . Instead , the bullpen will be set up to bring in the best reliever in a tie game in the seventh inning . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lives in Lawrence , Kan. , says the switch is a no-brainer . He says the current system  --  setup guys leading to a ninth-inning closer  --  is n't efficient and managers waste their best relief pitcher protecting three-run leads in the ninth . He says that , according to his computer simulations , when a relief ace pitches at least one inning when the game is tied , say in the seventh inning , a team 's winning percentage is .574 ; when it does n't happen , the winning percentage drops to near .500 . <p> " Using your relief ace to protect a three-run lead is like a business using a top executive to negotiate fire insurance , " James says . <p> Managers remain skeptical <p> Playoff managers from last October are skeptical . They say statistics are nice but do n't take into account the human element , such as finding a pitcher that has the personality to handle ninth-inning pressure . And managers say the one-inning closer gives a team the chance to win four games a week . Also , managers say a reliever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's call or the way an infielder lines up . <p> " In my opinion , a three-run lead is one of those classic situations , " says St. Louis manager Tony La Russa , who established the one-inning closer with Dennis Eckersley and the Oakland Athletics in 1988 . " If you lose that game , it is more harmful than losing the one-run lead . It 's a tougher loss than getting beat by 10 . It would have an effect for the next day or days . " <p> La Russa also says that , for subtle reasons , a closer getting three outs in the ninth inning is more difficult than doing the same thing in either the seventh or eighth inning . <p> " Amen on that one , " says Dusty Baker , who managed San Francisco in the World Series last season and takes over the Chicago Cubs this spring . <p> " What happens if your closer pitches two innings , or is scheduled to pitch two innings , and he throws 25 or 30 pitches in an inning ? If your closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not have him the next day . <p> " I use statistics , but I try not to get overwhelmed with them . They are important , but they do n't explain the human element . And sometimes there is no explanation for the human element . There 's no explanation for why a batter hits a good pitch . Statistics ca n't explain why a good pitcher misses with his best pitch . The greatest computer on earth is still the brain . " <p> Without Urbina , who is with the Texas Rangers , the Red Sox 's bullpen will be a collection of pitchers  --  lefty Alan Embree and right-handers Ramiro Mendoza , Mike Timlin , Bobby Howry and Chad Fox  --  whose common thread is that they worked in both setup and closer roles . <p> Timlin , a setup guy for the 1992 and 1993 Toronto Blue Jays teams that won the World Series , has the most career saves , 114 . Howry had 28 saves with the Chicago White Sox in 1999 but has been a setup guy since . Mendoza is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man for the Yankees ' Rivera . <p> " What 's the point of saving your closer for the ninth inning if your team loses the game in the seventh inning ? " Howry says . " I 've done everything . For some guys , though , it is a little different situation in the ninth inning than the seventh inning . The key is to have more than one good pitcher in the bullpen . " <p> If it works , others will follow <p> The son of a carpenter , James grew up in Mayetta , Kan. , 85 miles north of Topeka . He was never a good player , but even when he got hooked on the game in 1961 , it was for an unconventional reason : The Yankees ' Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were in their historic home run chase , but James ' love affair with baseball started by listening on radio to his favorite player , shortstop Dick Howser of the Kansas City Athletics , who hit .280 and challenged for the American League Rookie of the Year . <p> James @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied into a career of writing baseball statistical books . For many years he worked as a consultant to agents for players on salary arbitration cases , then this offseason he was hired by Henry . <p> The Red Sox have had problems with stats guys . In 1997 one of their stats experts suggested , on the basis of research , that Tim Spehr , a weak-hitting catcher with a .198 career average , bat cleanup . <p> James always has understood the value of scouting : " Evaluating a player without seeing the player is like being a movie reviewer without going to the movies . You could do it , but I do n't know why . " <p> In a computer age , baseball is exploding with statistics , which have been controversial with their use . But statistical analysis accenting scouting reports is becoming more common . James says his job is to present alternatives , and manager Grady Little decides how to use his pitchers . <p> James hopes to open doors for more statistics , but he might wind up being a trailblazer for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport . <p> " If the Red Sox win , there are going to be a lot more teams getting ready to try the same thing next year at this time , " Baker says . <p> Teams need not wait for relief <p> Author Bill James has been pushing for a new relief system for many years . <p> According to his " Valuing Relievers " in The New Bill James Historical Baseball Abstract , he says that one-inning closers are not the optimal way to use a bullpen . <p> " Far better to use your relief ace when the score is tied , even if that is the seventh inning , than in the ninth inning with a lead of two or more runs , " James writes . <p> He says that each run saved in a tie game has more than eight times the impact of a run saved with a three-run lead . <p> According to James , the perfect way to use a relief ace : <p> * Two innings a game when the game is tied . <p> * Two innings a game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inning at a time in other games when the game is close at the end and the ace has n't been used for a day or two . <p> " In other words , " he writes , " bring in your man when you 're ahead by one after seven innings , when you 're tied after seven innings , or when the game is close and the relief ace is n't tired .
