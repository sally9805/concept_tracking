ONE APRIL MORNING NOT long ago , in our green old college town of Granger City , California , two alien sophomores violated campus regulations . Attending our university under the one-sided intergalactic student exchange program imposed by our Rigelian " visitors , " they had been peaceful enough , busy with the mediated courses we supervise ( now most of our curriculum ) , until that morning when they fell out over some trivial question of miscegenation . The two had become involved in an intricate and  --  we are informed  --  sometimes painful roman a quatre with a native Californian and a hairy quadruped from a small planet in a minor system , one so insignificant as to bear only a catalog number ( Bonn Durchmusterung +16 Degrees , 2257 ) . <p> Faculty Dictum : Miscegenation has ended racism on our planet , and we find it incomprehensible that until well into the past century it was illicit in much of what was then the United States . Now we are confident that coitus among our newer students will do the same for intergalactic amity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produces viable issue . <p> And so they resolved to settle their differences in one of the dreadful duels  --  the Rigelian " visitors " romantic amalgam of the chivalric code , German students ' dueling Verbindungen , and American wild west shootouts  --  that are now such an integral part of the college scene . The sports-loving aliens have become obsessed with their odd version of our cowboy mythos and have enlisted many of our domestic students in their competitions . <p> Faculty Dictum : Duels on our campus are proscribed as false replications of historical practices , as are intoxication , plagiarism , the consumption of live fish , and the theft of undergarments belonging to students of any gender . <p> The weapons the duelers chose were conventional repeating quarkers ; their mounts were the small , quarter-ton ground-effect utility ductors they had stolen , to the ire of our university groundskeepers , from our motor pool . These are the lively little quasi-military vehicles that are the latest in the enduring General Purpose ( G.P. or " jeep " ) series extending back to Earth 's next-to-the-last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century . <p> Faculty Dictum : Affectionate tales of the " heroic " little vehicle that was readily stolen unless disabled by removal of the distributor rotor are also false historical replications , and are discouraged , as is speculation about the meaning in this context of " distributor rotor . ' <p> The duelists met at dawn on our nearly deserted quadrangle , the whine and swoosh of their machines reverberating among the mirrored carbofil facades of our buildings and echoing down from the misty blue of the Granger City Dome , which is low over our campus . The racket woke our students in their dorms and disturbed our handful of animate faculty and communications technicians in their cells and cloisters . We too were awakened  --  that is , powered up from standby mode  --  by the noise , sound being one of the few sensory perceptions left to us . <p> The Rigelian Tau , who had started the quarrel by making rude jests about the multiple and colorful penes of the Rigelian Gamma and the comically lustful noises of his quadruped lover , was the more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into one of our fine old Sycamores . These were planted back in the time of the second ozone scare and the beginning of the Great Reforestation Movement in the twenties . <p> But the Gamma was for the nonce lucky . As he fled on foot , chaps flapping and spurs jingling , his callous pursuer cut a bloody swath through a newly gathered gape of spectators and struck hard upon our low , wrought-iron drinking fountain ( gift of the class of ' 04 ) hidden among his victims . Our little jeep flipped , tossing the Tau and his quarker in a low trajectory over our fountain and into the white stone lintel of our Language Arts building , where his horned head deposited a gelatinous burst of scarlet and gray , which are , incidentally , our school colors . <p> The Rigelian Gamma , thus delivered from threat , screamed his native cry of triumph , thrust forth his iridescent bacula in an uncontrollable spasm of joy , and performed his race 's traditional victory celebration seriatim  --  upon the supine forms of three student cowgirls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ team in his regulation snakeskin boots and knee-length jeans , and one crinolined professor of Xenolinguistics , whose pleas for gentleness delivered in the Rigelian 's own language inordinately excited him . <p> A moment later , spent and dazed from his busy early morning , the Rigelian Gamma was lassoed and violently pulled apart by our angry students , faculty , and groundskeepers . <p> Faculty Dictum : Summary , on-campus execution of malefactors is Item ( b ) in Section 4 of the List of Disapproved Campus Celebratory Activities , along with the destruction of goal posts ( a ) , student occupation of administrative offices ( c ) , and ritual defloration ( d ) . <p> Now all this would have amounted to very little , just another student hijinks story reported in our carefully monitored campus newspaper , had it not been for an ambitious young student leader named Henry Najeeb . A large , muscular man with much dark facial hair in stylish bobs about an aquiline nose and full lips , he was the scion of one of Southern California 's powerful Amerarab families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stores and feely-plug rental outlets in Riverside County . Partly because one of the Rigelian Gamma 's cowgirl victims had been Najeeb 's sometime lover but mostly because he knew a good political cause when he saw one , he roused first our campus and then the town . By nightfall chanting lynch mobs had left no alien alive in Granger City , although their torches occasioned some substantial air-quality problems within our dome . <p> Despite our best efforts and those of local , continental , and planetary governments , word of the Granger City massacre spread quickly around the globe , converting to violent xenophobia a humanity whose hatred of the aliens had been repressed in the name of interstellar amity reinforced by a prudent planetary cowardice . Within a week , almost all the thousands of alien traders , protoplasm collectors , students , adventurers , and diplomats who had come to Earth ( named psarkit djah , " our new frontier , " in middle high Rigelian ) were gone . Many were murdered by angry mobs ; most were able to escape via one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organic spacecraft . <p> Faculty Dictum : Genocide , however merited , is strictly prohibited on campus for nearly all ethnic groups . <p> Young Najeeb , widely acclaimed the prophet of a new order , rose to power as swiftly as any media creation in history . He was quickly appointed to leadership in governing councils at the local , state , continental and planetary levels , although we did not make him president of our student body . By the summer of his twenty-fourth year , six weeks after the Granger City duel , Henry Najeeb was the most admired and hence most powerful person on Earth , and it was to him that the dire message from the Supreme Galactic Council was delivered . <p> Thereupon  --  clad in full evening Western , from ten-gallon Borsalino to cock-heeled Ferragamos  --  he finally came to the dais before us to seek our wisdom and counsel . <p> " Sirs and madams , " he said in the formal studentspeak we require of petitioners , his drawl reverberating among the vaulted arches and formerets of the great dome that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Profs , deans , an ' docs : Ah , Henry Najeeb , Senior Second Class in the College of the Way Things Go , do petition y'all for aid and counsel . Ah have paid the ten-credit fee and had my student Ah.D. card stamped . " <p> " Speak , Senior Second Class Najeeb ! " we thundered with oracular resonance . We use our cave-of-winds voice with petitioners ; it is built into our circuitry and tends to obscure the fact that we are one hundred and seven kilograms of silicon and rare earth oxides ( mostly field-effect opto with some hydronics at the front end ) and a few more than twelve hundred sealed and wired Erlenmeyer flasks containing our soft dark selves twitching in deliciously comfortable amber fluid . <p> " Ah have got mah ass in a crack , " said Najeeb in his meticulously archaic student lingo , " and maybe yours and ever'body else 's too . " <p> We have an Aha ! circuit useful in both studentspeak and facultyspeak . " Aha ! " we said . " While we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be carried too far . What have you been up to , Mr. Najeeb ? " <p> " It 's the massacre of them aliens last month . The Galactic Council has written us that they 're more'n a little pissed and gittin ' kinda tired of our planet anyways , and fer starters , they 're gon na go ahead and destroy Granger City . " <p> " When ? " <p> " Thursday next . At 11:30 in the morning . " <p> We have a most impressive administratorspeak hmmm circuit little used in studentspeak and facultyspeak . " Hmmm , " we said . " This will require thought and , of course , consultation . We will hear our several constituencies , Mr. Najeeb , and let you know our findings through regular campus channels . " <p> " But there 's nothin ' to decide ! " Najeeb cried , darting his eyes around him at the dim and vastly domed mosaic of our faces , scanned from the faculty sections of old yearbooks and restored pixel by patient pixel to faultless eight-by-ten-foot glossies . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Indian fighters and we 're a bunch a ol ' Indians , and we got ta do somethin ' ! " Our impressively vaulted chamber echoed his final syllable : thin  --  thin  --  thin . <p> " Through established university channels ! " we thundered . " In the meantime you are excused . " <p> Najeeb left , muttering , and we set to work . <p> The first step for us , of course , was to dis-integrate , which instantly brought the babble of twelve hundred voices , each belonging to a learned individual who considered him- or herself to be an original thinker with a proprietary interest in truth and virtue . These are the qualities that made us proud to be professors and led generations of students in annual popular referenda to select us t sometimes snatching us from graves dating back almost to the founding of the institution in 1927  --  as the university 's finest , and thus appropriate candidates for reconstitution into our current selves , the Mediated Faculty . Twitching . In our glorious amber fluid . <p> There followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The life scientists proposed a biological weapon that would eliminate all life on the aliens ' home planets or at least make their spaceships ill , but the physical scientists could not agree on an appropriate delivery system . The social scientists suggested normative and summative studies of cross-cultural patterns of aggression . They had a title , " The Transmogrification of Exogenic Chi-Factor Determinants in Strife Resolution : A Vertical Exegesis " and sixteen co-authors before pen ( speaking , of course , metaphorically ) was set to paper . The engineers designed a complex subterranean shelter complete with a state-of-the-art sanitary leach field . And the English Department  --  as it had on every issue since the invention of the DNA recovery process that reanimated us and , incidentally , made possible the third Reagan administration  --  voted to secede from the university . <p> When all departmental proposals had been aired , all opinions expressed in exacting detail  --  and then repeated  --  our chair , wise and experienced , struck her gavel ( again , metaphorically ) and reactivated integration . <p> Faculty Dictum : Campus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ democratic processes , and in full consultation with all members of the campus community , whenever time allows . <p> We called for a top administrator , and when he had been released to our custody , we instructed him to solve the problem . Only a decade older than Student Second Class Najeeb , President Hwang-Ng was stooped and balding after three years in office . Dressed in his customary blue pinstripe jumpsuit , he assumed the dais . A beam of yellow light reserved to honor persons of rank cascaded dramatically down upon him . His pate gleamed . <p> " Learned friends and colleagues , " he began in the polished administratorspeak that had convinced our search committee to recommend him to our Board , " you honor me with your confidence . As always I defer to the wisdom of the faculty , but I have seen the letter from the Supreme Galactic Council and I have informed the Board that Najeeb is right when he says our ass is in a crack , that the Council intends to destroy us all next Thursday , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ massive , planetary retaliation . " <p> Hwang-Ng paused a moment to allow his final syllable , " shun  --  shun  --  shun , " to cease its echoing , and then he added : " The Board extends you its best wishes and assures you of its confidence in your governance of the university while they and my administration are on retreat for the next week or so down in Disney County or maybe further south in the Baja Protectorate , we have n't yet decided which would be safer ... uh ... more conducive to our task  --  ask  --  ask  --  ask . " <p> WE AGAIN DIS-INTEGRATED and this time we listened to individual Erlenmeyers , particularly those from the Libertine Arts . We heard painters and holographers who debated post this and retro that . We listened as a nasal flautist did variations on Von Webber 's Casuistry Cantata , and  --  to our eventual profit  --  we took telling testimony from Professor Mizkitti , the xenolinguist who not only had newly joined our number at the hands of the lynched Rigelian Gamma but also understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Spin this , " she said . " Gamma killed Tau in a duel , and then he himself died when someone defended my  --  uh  --  honor . Maybe we ought to offer our invaders another contest with my champion . " <p> At this we re-integrated , put our heads together  --  an unavoidable act considering our circuitry  --  and agreed upon our course of action . <p> We called Mr. Najeeb back before us . " Senior Second Class Najeeb , " we intoned . " Hear our formal resolution : " <p> WHEREAS the Supreme Galactic Council intends to destroy this university in retaliation for the extra-duel death of a Rigelian student , a probable first step in the ultimate destruction of our planet as our visitors tire of their " New Frontier ; " and <p> WHEREAS our visitors have amply demonstrated their regard for the field of honor as the means for conflict resolution ; and <p> WHEREAS the victory of a champion chosen by the university to represent it will likely satisfy the Council 's demand for honorable redress and return us to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ City massacre ; and <p> WHEREAS , on the other hand , the defeat of said champion is just as likely to convince the Council of our utter inferiority and render us uninteresting for further exploitation by their traders , protoplasm collectors , students , adventurers , and diplomats ; therefore be it <p> RESOLVED that you , Henry Najeeb , Senior etc. and Most Admired Man on Earth , do forthwith go forth with fortitude and with our assurance of our gratitude and procure a suitable gauntlet to throw down before the Galactic Council 's champion . <p> Mr. Najeeb , suddenly illuminated by our honoring beam of yellow light but wise to his problematic future , turned to leave our dim amber presence , his shoulders hunched in resignation . He did not even then , however , abandon the impeccable studentspeak that had taken him so far and now made him our last , best hope . <p> " Aw shit , " he said . <p> Our dome echoed , it  --  it  --  it . <p> Early on Thursday morning , well before Granger City 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one  --  again whined and swooshed across our grassy quadrangle for a few short minutes . By that evening , the last of the aliens ' spaceports had been disassembled and packed into their strange , vastly swollen organic spacecraft . They were followed aboard by the remaining " visitors " led by the Council 's triumphant champion , a Rigelian Lambda with a new notch added to the many on the quarker holstered against his fringed chaps . <p> We had a little more silicon and a new Erlenmeyer , its occupant luxuriating in amber contentment , and we were eager to learn how this addition of a vigorous young student voice would improve our deliberations . <p> We had already learned something new that day , that our ground . effect jeeps can not be disabled by removing the distributor rotor . They have no distributor rotors . But as our fine groundskeepers demonstrated , they have other parts of equal vulnerability . <p> Faculty Dictum : Students distinguishing themselves in extracurricular activities such as competitive sports which bring renown to our campus community can expect swift promotion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author denies those rumors circulating of a showdown he might have had on the California streets of Carmel-by-the-sea with a gunslinger by the name of Eastwood . He does , however , admit to working on the city planning commission and says he has lately been concerned with the discreet placement of portable toilets a t construction sites , which he claims is not a far cry from his past work in academia . ( Let 's hope this claim does not provoke any challenges from former colleagues . ) <p>
