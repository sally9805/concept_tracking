My favorite portrait of Lincoln comes from the end of his life . In it , Lincoln 's face is as finely lined as a pressed flower . He appears frail , almost broken ; his eyes , averted from the camera 's lens , seem to contain a heartbreaking melancholy , as if he sees before him what the nation had so recently endured . <P> It would be a sorrowful picture except for the fact that Lincoln 's mouth is turned ever so slightly into a smile . The smile does n't negate the sorrow . But it alters tragedy into grace . It 's as if this rough-faced , aging man has cast his gaze toward eternity and yet still cherishes his memories  --  of an imperfect world and its fleeting , sometimes terrible beauty . On trying days , the portrait , a reproduction of which hangs in my office , soothes me ; it always asks me questions . <P> What is it about this man that can move us so profoundly ? Some of it has to do with Lincoln 's humble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I moved to Illinois 20 years ago to work as a community organizer , I had no money in my pockets and did n't know a single soul . During my first six years in the state legislature , Democrats were in the minority , and I could n't get a bill heard , much less passed . In my first race for Congress , I had my head handed to me . So when I , a black man with a funny name , born in Hawaii of a father from Kenya and a mother from Kansas , announced my candidacy for the U.S. Senate , it was hard to imagine a less likely scenario than that I would win  --  except , perhaps , for the one that allowed a child born in the backwoods of Kentucky with less than a year of formal education to end up as Illinois ' greatest citizen and our nation 's greatest President . <P> In Lincoln 's rise from poverty , his ultimate mastery of language and law , his capacity to overcome personal loss and remain determined in the face of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not just of my own struggles . He also reminded me of a larger , fundamental element of American life  --  the enduring belief that we can constantly remake ourselves to fit our larger dreams . <P> A connected idea attracts us to Lincoln : as we remake ourselves , we remake our surroundings . He did n't just talk or write or theorize . He split rail , fired rifles , tried cases and pushed for new bridges and roads and waterways . In his sheer energy , Lincoln captures a hunger in us to build and to innovate . It 's a quality that can get us in trouble ; we may be blind at times to the costs of progress . And yet , when I travel to other parts of the world , I remember that it is precisely such energy that sets us apart , a sense that there are no limits to the heights our nation might reach . <P> Still , as I look at his picture , it is the man and not the icon that speaks to me . I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As a law professor and civil rights lawyer and as an African American , I am fully aware of his limited views on race . Anyone who actually reads the Emancipation Proclamation knows it was more a military document than a clarion call for justice . Scholars tell us too that Lincoln was n't immune from political considerations and that his temperament could be indecisive and morose .
