The wall she 'd built with years of secrecy started to crack . <br> Hanna Kessler wrapped trembling arms around her waist and stared through the glass door into her parents ' backyard . A place she 'd avoided her whole stay . Sunlight danced in the still water of her mother 's koi pond and highlighted all the landscaping changes Dad had made since Mom 's death . <br> Hanna closed her eyes against warring memories of past and present . As a child , she 'd loved feeding the beautiful orange fish and hearing Mom laugh as the koi swarmed to the food . Now the little pond area was the only bit of her mother remaining . Maybe that was why she 'd glanced outside and then stood transfixed . She needed her mom now more than ever . <br> Swallowing hard , she opened her eyes and focused on Mom 's teakwood dolphin statue and the white rocks around the water , glinting in the late afternoon sun . She reached out to touch the warm glass but could n't force herself to open @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shivered . <br> She could n't go outside . <br> But she had to do something . Had to get away . So she stumbled into the rustic living room , her favorite place in the house . The surrounding family snapshots reminded her of simpler times . Boating on Kentucky Lake . Thunder over Louisville . Playing at Iroquois Park . Times when Mom and Dad and her brother , Steven , had wrapped her in their protection and love . <br> The front door rattled , then creaked open . " Anyone home ? " A man 's deep voice carried through the safe place she 'd escaped to months ago . It was n't safe anymore . <br> But her frozen feet refused to move.Where could she hide ? Footsteps thundered through the front hall , drawing closer . She had to get out . <br> Choking down the lump of panic in her throat , she ran back to the sliding glass doors and forced her feet tomove outside , onto the concrete patio . She could get to her car from there . The keys ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall form stepping out of the house and walking toward her . <br> " Hanna-girl , what 's gotten into you ? " <br> Her brain snapped to attention . The man in front of her was no threat . <br> " Daddy ! " She ran into his outstretched arms . <br> Andrew Kessler kissed the top of her head and chuckled . " You looked like you 'd seen a ghost . Did n't you get the message I left this morning ? " <br> Heartbeat still pounding out of her rib cage , she inhaled a few deep breaths before answering . She had n't checked messages today . And no way could she admit she 'd listened to most of the messages her family had left , never intending to return the calls . " II must have missed it . Sorry , Daddy . " <br> Try as she might to hide it , calling her father Daddy only happened when she was terrified . Or hiding . And she 'd done a lot of hiding . <br> Dad stepped back and tilted his head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm in Louisville for the weekend and had to see my girl . I miss you . So does everyone back in Alexandria . " <br> Even Michael ? She would n't ask . She had no right . Not after ignoring all the calls and letters he 'd sent . The ones declaring his love even though she 'd run away from everyone after her brother 's wedding . She could n't meet Dad 's eyes . <br> " Hanna , look at me . " He tilted her chin up . She fought to not pull away . " Steven asks about you every day . I 'm surprised your brother and Clint and the rest of their FBI friends have n't hightailed it up here to drag you home . " <br> " They would n't . " Especially not Michael . Not after almost two months of her frosty silence . <br> Dad laughed again . He had no idea the pain his questions , his presence here , caused . " Steven 's planned it . So has Michael . But they 're waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As if that would happen . " Susannah 's birthday party is a week from Saturday . Clint and the rest of us are praying you 'll come . Take pictures . Let us show you how much we love having you in Alexandria . " <br> A week from Saturday . The twenty-fifth of August . She would n't be there . Could n't face Clint Rollins . Not after her negligence had nearly cost Clint 's son his life . <br> Tears slipped past her clenched eyes . <br> " Oh , honey . " Dad gathered her back into his arms . " No one blames you , Hanna . No one . You need to let the past go . Everyone is safe now . All the Rollins clan . Even Conor . " <br> So Sara 's baby was still alive . Just like Steven 's and Clint 's messages had said . Relief rushed through her , causing her knees to wobble . But other guilt arrows pierced her heart . All the lies she 'd told Steven and Michael . Dad too . Clint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria . <br> " You 'll be there for Susannah 's party , right ? " His hopeful blue eyes begged . <br> She pulled out of his arms and walked back into the house.Dad followed . " II need a Kleenex . " Searching through the oak cabinets in the kitchen did n't produce any tissues . So she grabbed a paper towel from the counter . " What brings you in town ? During our phone calls last week , you never mentioned coming home . " <br> " If I had , would you have been here ? " <br> Ouch . " Yes , Daddy . " Another lie . " So are you here to check on the Mall St. Matthews coffee shop ? I 've been working there every day , just like you arranged . It 's going well . " And she was babbling . <br> " I 'm here to meet with some old friends on Friday and talk about upcoming business opportunities . " <br> Old friends . The memories rushing in unbidden surfaced more tears . And more cracks in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the house , out of the neighborhood.Now.Maybe then she could exhibit some self-control . <br> " Why do n't we grab a late lunch at the Cheesecake Factory ? After your long drive you 're bound to be hungry , right ? " She forced a smile . <br> " Okay , Hanna-girl . " He wiped away one of her stray tears . " On one condition . " <br> Please do n't ask about the party , Daddy . Please . <br> He lifted his bushy graying eyebrows . " Promise you 'll come back to us and take pictures at Susannah 's birthday party next week . " <br> The very thing she could n't do.How would she get out of this without telling more lies or spilling everything ? She had to avoid that.Maybe one last fib would get her though the weekend with Dad . <br> Then she could find somewhere else to run . <br> Continues ...
