At the risk of being labeled whiny by my brother Joe , I would like to take this opportunity to whine about the Steak Lovers ' Kit he sent for Christmas a few years back . It included a jar of sauce , four serrated knives , a cutting board and a pointy thing I later identified as a fork thermometer  --  but no steak . <P> In my family , this is what we call a classic . I come from a long line of bad-gift givers ( no , Mom , I did not like the Dances with Wolves soundtrack ) , but even I was impressed by how effortlessly the Steak Lovers ' Kit trumped all the other terrible , pointless presents of Christmases past . The nostril-hair trimmers and the devices to remove fabric pills from acrylic sweaters could n't hold a scented candle to the Steak Lovers ' Kit and its undeniable lack of steak . <P> This is a scary time of year to check the mail . The holiday gift-giving season , during which the average American shopper this year will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 15 people , really showcases my family 's talent for transforming innocent commodity items into emotion-laden symbols of how we truly feel about one another . Or not . Since there are only two people in the world I know well enough to guess what they would really like ( one of them is me ) , I was n't surprised to learn of a recent study that finds that 58% of recipients react negatively to their gifts . <P> In fact , University of Illinois researcher Cele Otnes concluded after studying 147 " gift experiences " that " gifts are an extremely inefficient use of money and psychic energy . " <P> While Professor Otnes says she was n't referring to any particular Christmas gifts , I had a feeling the tampons one participant in her survey received from a grandmother might have informed her opinion . Or maybe it was the woman who sent her sister a bag of Doritos and an opened jar of dip . <P> Since Professor Otnes has seen it all  --  from kids who receive generic items out of " gift closets " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute you get this ! "  --  I hoped she would support my plan this season to cut off my family entirely . <P> " Bad idea , " she says . She points out that such an extreme position would be offensive in a culture that considers gift giving one of its most important rituals . <P> Instead she tried to jolly me out of Grinch-hood by suggesting ( in a Cindy Lou Who voice ) that most gifts are n't bad enough to destroy a relationship . She points to my brother Joe 's Steak Lovers ' Kit . " All those accessories , " she says . " And he knew you like steak . Do you think he was trying to be thoughtful ? " <P> That shamed me into considering milder solutions , like gift certificates . " Recipients say they like them , " Professor Otnes reports , citing research . And for those really hard-to-buy-for people , like every member of my family ? Give them experiences instead of merchandise , she offers . Take them out to dinner or a play . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the giver , can horn in on . <P> If that does n't work , Professor Otnes suggests that a popular way to get rid of bad gifts is to recycle them . I , for instance , have other brothers who like steak . <P> For more on gifts , visit
