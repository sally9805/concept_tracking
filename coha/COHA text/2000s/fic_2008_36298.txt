Mei-hua lay curled next to him in the glow that followed love , her back against his chest , his arm around her waist , their breathing synchronized . Everything was perfect . Or so it seemed to Samuel Devrey . <p> After a time she moved just enough so one foot caressed his calf . The silken wrappings of her golden lily , the foot that had been first bound when she was three  --  excruciating pain inflicted and endured for him , indeed at his behest  --  were exquisitely erotic . Sam felt the sap rise in him yet again but he resisted . " There is n't time . " He breathed the words into the jasmine scent of her hair . <p> His Mandarin could be understood , but it had been learned too late to be perfect . His tones were never exactly right . He spoke always the speech of the yang gwei zih , the foreign devil . Mei-hua would die a slow death before she would correct him . " My lord not need do much . Quick and easy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those supple adjustments of her body that always astonished him , and her hips realigned so that he could take her effortlessly , in an act of possession as natural and undemanding as a whisper . It would have been against nature to refuse a generosity offered with such elegance . He moved the hand that had stroked her belly so it gripped her thigh , pressing her more closely to him . Both golden lilies were touching him now , wrapped around his legs . She was a silken splendid butterfly , tiny but exquisite , cocooned in his bulk . Her sigh of pleasure  --  more a vibration than a sound  --  thrilled him as if it were again the first time , three years earlier , when she was thirteen . <p> " You are astonishing , " he said when he could speak . <p> She gently pulled away , then settled back against his body and pulled his hand back to her belly where it had been before . " What do you feel , lord ? " <p> " Samuel , " he corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will spank you . " Her smile was hidden from him , but he knew it was there . " For real this time . " He attempted to sound severe . " You wo n't be able to sit for a week . " <p> " I am sure I will deserve it . You are right in all things , lo  --  Samuel . But you can not spank me now . " <p> " Why not ? " <p> " It maybe ... " He heard the hesitation though she hurried to cover it . " Maybe disturb harmony . Your tai-tai never lose harmony . Never . " <p> Repetition was the way the Chinese conveyed emphasis . Tai-tai meant not simply wife but senior wife , she to whom all other wives  --  if such there might be  --  owed allegiance . Devrey knew both things , but he seldom remembered to repeat a word he meant to strengthen . As for the rest , it was n't practical . <p> He had married Mei-hua in the room beyond this one , in a ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Afterward she had been brought to this bed on its raised red satin platform hung about with quilted red velvet to perform her first duty as his wife , to sit absolutely still for hours and demonstrate her inner harmony . Meanwhile Devrey had been taken downstairs to eat and drink , and only occasionally remind himself that if he stepped out the door he would be not in this exotic Chinese world but on Cherry Street in New York , a few steps from the busy waterfront . Four hours later , when he had returned to the bedroom to claim what was his , Meihua was exactly as he 'd left her . Except for her smile of joyous welcome . <p> " You could never be disharmonious , " he said now . <p> His voice was steady , the words without any hint of anger or disapproval , but she could feel his fury in the heat of his skin and the coldness of his breath . " I try never displease you , lord . " Not true . She had tried very hard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her after lovemaking , she lay for long , boring hours with her feet above her head so his seed would find the son-making place deep inside . She had eaten only son-making food , though it was not always her favorite . Only the gods knew how hard she tried . And Ah Chee . <p> Mei-hua could not see the bedroom door from her present position , but she knew beyond doubt that her servant was near , probably listening . " I do nothing to displease my lord . Never . Never . " Big lie , but never mind . <p> " Samuel , " he corrected again , delivering at the same time one slap to her buttocks . Light enough to be playful but hard enough to sting . <p> Mei-hua stiffened and rolled away , clasping both hands below her waist as she did so . " Husband is correct . I deserve beating . " She jumped off the bed , got the bamboo stick they used to close the red velvet curtains , and brought it to him , kneeling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mattress . " I stay like this and husband beat back and shoulders until they bleed , only no part below waist . Then I will never  --  " <p> " I have never beaten you , Mei-hua . Why would I start now ? Above or below the waist . " He got up and put the stick back by the window , then drew her to her feet , kissing her face all the while , little soft kisses . <p> " Because husband is displeased with me . " <p> " No , I am not . I understand you . " The silk robe , the long lung pao he 'd worn earlier , lay on a nearby chair , splendid green satin with dragons embroidered in silver thread . Samuel passed it by in favor of his western clothes , carefully hung in an elaborately carved wardrobe . He pulled on the tight black trousers and black boots and high-necked white shirt and tied his stock . " I must go . " <p> " It is early . Useless old Ah Chee made soup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps tomorrow . You rest now . " He picked up her pale yellow silk robe and draped it over her shoulders , lifting her back into the bed as he did so . " Sleep , Mei-hua . Stay beautiful for me . " <p> The room beyond was as exotic and foreign as the bedroom , if not as sensuous . The furnishings  --  rosewood , ebony , ornaments of luminous porcelain and glowing brass  --  had all arrived from Canton when Meihua did , part of her dowry , along with the servant woman . <p> Ah Chee 's skin was creased leather and her hair white , but she seemed to Samuel ageless . She stood by the front door , eyes cast down , hands folded , ready to usher him out . Hard to say if she knew he was leaving by the way he was dressed or if , as he suspected , she listened regularly to everything that happened in the bedroom . " My lord stay a little stay , " she urged . " Maybe take some of this old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked straight to her and slapped her hard across the face . She did not move , seemed barely even to flinch . He slapped her a second time . He knew she would n't react , but it calmed some of the rage in his belly . " When did tai-tai bleed last ? " And when she did n't answer , " Tell me . If you lie , I swear I will cut out your tongue . " <p> " In Last month , lord . Before start of Water Sheep year . " <p> He did the calculation quickly . Last month was January , and this year , 1834 , was Water Sheep . " When did she stop taking the special drink ? " He bought the powder himself from a Mrs. Langton on Christopher Street . Guaranteed to prevent conception as long as a woman drank it dissolved in ale every morning before sunrise . <p> " Never , lord . Never . Never . Every day I wake up tai-tai and she drink . " Ah Chee did not say that the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spat it out almost as soon as the mixture touched her mouth . Anyway , the powder was probably useless . What did a yang gwei zih woman know of such things ? Ah Chee , whose job it had been to look after this plum blossom since the day she was born , got make-no-baby powder from Hor Jick the apothecary  --  the closest thing to a proper doctor , a yi , in this place  --  and sprinkled it on the girl 's food , and twice a day rubbed excellent lizard skin cream on Mei-hua 's beautiful flat belly . Until , that is , she had judged the plum blossom to be ready and stopped sprinkling and rubbing . " Never , lord , never , " she repeated . " Tai-tai drink every day . " <p> " Still ? Even after she missed two monthlies ? " <p> " Yes , lord , yes . Drink . Drink . " <p> " You are a lying old witch . " He itched to slap her again but knew it would make no difference . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the latch click , signaling Samuel 's departure . She ran from the bedroom in a whirl of yellow silk and flung herself at Ah Chee , fists flying , pounding out her rage . " You tell . You tell . Old woman say I do not bleed already two months . You tell . " <p> Ah Chee stood calmly under the onslaught . Eventually Mei-hua 's anger turned to misery , and she retreated to huddle , weeping , in the elaborately carved red-lacquered throne chair , usually reserved for her husband , under the scroll depicting Fu Xing , the god of happiness , whose benign smile did not alter whatever happened in this room . <p> For once the old woman did not rush to dry the girl 's tears . " You think Lord Samuel stupid ? Soon tai-tai 's flat little girl belly get big and round . Will the lord not see ? Will he think tai-tai swallowed a melon ? " <p> Such considerations were for the future . Mei-hua was concerned only with this terrible moment . " Now my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jick devil yi , and he put filthy devil yi hands on me and make son jump out of belly and  --  " <p> " No , not happen . Not . No devil doctor Hor Taste Bad , " Ah Chee said , using the nickname by which the apothecary was generally known . <p> Mei-hua stopped weeping and looked up . " Why you think this ? Why ? " <p> " Know definitely for sure . No Taste Bad . Absolutely . " Ah Chee did not wait to answer more questions . Instead she went to the kitchen and returned with a bowl of hot soup . " Tai-tai open mouth . I feed son . " <p> " Wait  --  " <p> Ah Chee did not wait . She spooned soup into the girl 's open mouth . It was so hot that it scalded Mei-hua 's throat , but she swallowed it quickly , turning her head aside so Ah Chee could not immediately force a second spoonful on her . " Wait , old woman . Wait . First tell why you are sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devil yi . " <p> " Because Taste Bad devil yi one of us , civilized person . Lord Samuel take tai-tai himself to white yang gwei zih . Make sure abortion done properly . " <p> Mei-hua gasped in horror , and Ah Chee took the opportunity to spoon more hot soup down her throat . <p> Cherry Street ran parallel to the East River , two streets back from the docks , a little above the mercantile southern heart of the city . Though George Washington had lived briefly in a house on Cherry when he was president  --  Martha complained that the ceilings were too low for the feathers in the ladies ' hats  --  the area was not the same . The wealthy had been fleeing the tumult of the lower town of late , deserting even their grand residences on Broadway and around Battery Park for the quiet of the numbered streets and avenues further up the island . These days , the grid adopted in 1809 , a tight mesh of interlocking streets and avenues laid out across every inch of a Manhattan of hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been implemented from TenthStreet to Fourteenth and from First to Eighth avenues . The grid 's virtue was that it allowed the greatest possible number of people to be housed on the island . It was a vision made inevitable because another had been realized . <p> Opened in 1827 , the Erie Canal ran from Lake Erie in the west to the Hudson River in the east , establishing a direct water route to New York 's magnificent harbor from the outer edge of the ever-expanding nation . There were twenty-four united states now , with Missouri the westernmost , and the far-flung territories of Michigan , Arkansas , and Florida bidding to join soon . The Erie Canal allowed the great city to open her mighty maw and swallow everything the industrious folk living so distant from the coast could produce , then spew it forth across the ocean . Such an increase of business was a racketing , riotous dream come true for the money men who had always ruled this town , but not one their wives wished to have clattering day and night outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they migrated north to the numbered streets above Bleecker . Cherry Street was no part of uppertendom 's world . <p> A bitter wind blew off the river when Sam Devrey came into the street . Snow was coming down in earnest , and already the ragged roof line of the closely packed three- and four-story wooden houses was edged with a thick white border . The two buildings closest to the intersection of Cherry and Market Streets , numbers thirty-seven and thirty-nine , belonged to him personally , not to Devrey Shipping . Both were built of wood . Thirty-seven was three stories high , thirty-nine four , and each was three windows wide . Once private homes , they were now lodging houses like the others on the block , densely packed with laborers who paid fifty cents a week for whatever bit of floor they could claim . Devrey 's lodgings were even more tightly packed than the others . His tenants were Chinese , willing to tolerate any degree of crowding to be with their own kind . Mostly they were sailors who had accidentally washed ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , because that was the point on the globe where Asia touched the West . The single exception to the allocation of space was that Mei-hua and Ah Chee occupied the entire upper floor of the corner house , number thirty-nine , an area that would have housed at least twelve of the Chinese men . <p> None of Samuel 's tenants questioned the arrangement , or in any way encroached on the young beauty most had never set eyes on , the supreme first lady tai-tai . As for Ah Chee , they nodded respectfully when she went past , and when sometimes she joined them for a game of cards and a drink of plum brandy , they were inclined to let her win . This despite the fact that except for those two , the tiny Chinese community was without females of any sort . It was but one of the hardships they bore . Another was their inability to look like everyone else in this place . That was not simply a matter of skin color or having almond-shape rather than round eyes . In China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
