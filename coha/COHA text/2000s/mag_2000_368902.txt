WELL , THERE GOES THE NEIGHBORHOOD ... <P> The man who first taught us the importance of changing shoes whenever we go indoors is stepping away from the spotlight . FRED MCFEELY ROGERS , 72 , master puppeteer and champion of the cardigan-and-tie look since well before most Prada models were born , has announced he will film the last original episode of Mister Rogers ' Neighborhood next month . For close to 1,000 episodes ( three times as many as M*A*S*H ) , he invited children to explore the depths of their psyches as well as the Neighborhood of Make-Believe , introducing them to the inimitable Prince Tuesday and Henrietta Pussycat and reminding them that some of us are fancy on the outside , some on the inside . Rogers says he is n't retiring ; he plans to work on museum and website projects . And of course , with so many episodes in the can , many of his audience may not notice the difference . Just promise us one thing , Mister R. : no movie spin-offs . <P> THE GIFT THAT KEEPS ON @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has taken up a new cause , the Douglas fund . For their wedding last weekend , Douglas and bride CATHERINE ZETA-JONES asked friends to make donations to a fund they 're setting up for their son Dylan . The money will go to a " charitable foundation established for Dylan to learn about giving , " a spokesman told reporters . " When he comes of age , he can choose what organizations he 'd like to give the money to . It 's not a trust fund . " Douglas could be trying to give Dylan attention he could n't give his first son Cameron , who has had a few minor scrapes with the law . " When Cameron was growing up , I had so much work , " he has said . " We all make mistakes as parents , and I have n't been there as much as I would have liked over the years . " Douglas ' and Zeta-Jones ' friends were n't the only ones paying out at the wedding . It 's rumored that the happy occasion was sponsored by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ NOW LET 'S SEE ED BRADLEY DANCE <P> Most of contemporary music 's great sex symbols lodge themselves in our hearts via steamy videos on MTV , not hard-hitting reportage on CBS . But The Girl ( She 's Mine ) , a single featuring the vocals of octogenarian 60 Minutes anchorman MIKE WALLACE , seems likely to earn a place beside Sisqo 's Thong Song as one of our age 's erotic masterpieces . The song was written by Pat Harris , an unsigned recording artist who goes by the name " Pat . Patperiod . " Harris , fortuitously enough , is also a researcher on CBS 's still-ticking Sunday-night newsmagazine . After overhearing Wallace singing around the office one day , he hatched the idea of their doing a duet . In the tradition of My Way , the song features lyrics only a true softie like Wallace could carry off : " Imagination  --  /What a sensation ! /For yours , I give you a standin ' ovation . " It 's just a damn shame the Rat Pack has broken up . <P> QUITE A SUIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
