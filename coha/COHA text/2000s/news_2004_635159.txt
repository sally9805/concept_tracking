<p> Maybe Detective Janet McCarthy sees a little of herself in the yellowed newspaper photo of the doe-eyed girl murdered on her way to St. Mary of Mount Carmel Church . <p> Nine-year-old Gloria Kowalewicz was wearing a pink and brown checked dress as she walked to mass from her home near 67th and Damen . She never made it . <p> Gloria was found shot twice in the head in a forest preserve near Palos Park on that leaf-strewn November day in 1960  --  just about two weeks after her first communion . <p> " She was my age at the time , " McCarthy said . " I did n't know her , but I went to high school in Marquette Park with kids who knew her . " <p> Now McCarthy is a member of the Chicago Police cold-case squad . And of all the murder mysteries she would like to solve , Gloria 's is it . <p> " This is my career case , " she said . <p> McCarthy works with 17 other detectives , two sergeants and a lieutenant in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West Side . They all seem to have a case that they would give anything to solve . <p> Officially called the Central Homicide Evaluation Support Squad , the unit was formed in 1999 by former police Supt. Terry Hillard . <p> It sprang from a task force that spent more than three years working on a series of murders of women in Englewood and other South Side neighborhoods . <p> A " cold case " is defined as an unsolved murder older than a year . <p> Since about half of all homicides are unsolved  --  and there are hundreds of killings a year in Chicago  --  there is a mountain of cold cases for detectives to sift through . <p> So far , the cold-case squad has solved 101 killings , the oldest one involving a man who shot his wife in 1975 . <p> A lot of work <p> It 's not the squad you may have seen on TV 's " Cold Case . " <p> On the Hollywood show , it takes hours for detectives to get back laboratory results . In real life , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ typically find their witnesses on the first knock on the door . In reality , witnesses move a lot . Sometimes they 're living out of town . Or they 're dead . <p> In short , cold-case investigations require tedious legwork  --  and waiting . <p> " It takes approximately six months to solve one of these cases , on average , " said Sgt. Joseph Salemme , a supervisor of the unit . " Each detective has five to seven cases they are actively looking at , ideally in different stages of completion . It does n't sound like a lot , but it 's really a lot of work . " <p> Many of the cold-case investigations start on McCarthy 's desk , which is stacked with bulging manila files . Each is labeled with a homicide victim 's name and the date of the killing . <p> She scours the files for anything that could help solve the case . <p> McCarthy checks whether any physical evidence has survived years of storage . She writes down the names of the witnesses identified at the time of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she studies what the original investigators did . <p> Supervisors look at her preliminary work and decide whether to take up the case . Sometimes the file goes back on the shelf . <p> " There are cases that you 'd love to solve , but the evidence is gone and the witnesses are dead , " said Lt. Thomas Keane , commanding officer of the unit . " You would just be spinning your wheels . " <p> Most members of the cold-case squad have been on the force more than 20 years  --  and have worked at least 15 years as a " homicide dick , " slang for a detective . <p> Most of them have served a majority of their careers in one of the city 's five area police headquarters . With 598 killings last year , the pace in area headquarters is " very , very hectic and every day is another tragedy , " Keane said . <p> " In the areas , you have a lot of balls in the air and sometimes you ca n't complete one task before you are dragged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , by the nature of the job , you can be more selective and devote more energy and at a slower pace . " <p> A white board in a corner of the office shows the time-consuming steps one detective is taking to solve his cases . <p> Detective James Washburn writes the names of the victims in erasable red ink . Under each name is a to-do list of witnesses to talk to , fingerprints to check , financial reports to obtain , and on and on . <p> Five of his cases  --  including Judith Wallace , a police officer 's mother killed in 1989  --  have been solved , according to the board . They have the words " cleared by arrest " written underneath them in green letters . <p> Witnesses and DNA <p> DNA evidence has played a central role in solving many of the cold-case squad 's murders . <p> " It 's the crystal ball we always dreamed of , " said Keane , @x 32-year veteran . <p> Still , the mantra for cold-case detectives is " witnesses , witnesses , witnesses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DNA case . <p> And when DNA is unavailable from such evidence as old fingernail scrapings , a bloody shirt or semen from a " rape kit , " witness testimony may be all the police can get . <p> The most common witness to come forward with new information is an inmate in state prison or Cook County Jail trying to " work off " his time behind bars , Salemme said . <p> Chicago police detectives and Cook County sheriff 's investigators monitor what happens in the jail and forward the intelligence on old murders to the cold case squad . <p> In 2002 , Detectives David Wright and Stanley Sanders developed a confidential informant in the jail . The informant told the detectives that members of the Traveling Vice Lords street gang killed Christopher Lane in 1995 . The informant said he thought he could get Daniel Cross to talk about the murder . <p> So the informant wrote to Cross saying he was getting out of jail and wanted to visit him at the prison in Vandalia where Cross was serving time for an unrelated crime . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the informant talking with Cross . <p> On July 23 , 2002 , detectives signed the informant out of Cook County Jail and traveled to Vandalia , where Cross made tape-recorded statements identifying himself as one of the shooters , officials said . <p> Later confronted with the tape recording , Cross allegedly confessed to Wright and Washburn , and was charged with first-degree murder . <p> Less common is a regular citizen coming forward with information about a murder . But as the cold-case squad becomes better known , those tips have been increasing , too , Salemme said . <p> The confession <p> The hundreds of hours spent on a typical cold case sometimes lead up to a magical moment for a detective : the confession . <p> Salemme said the reaction is always the same when a suspect learns he 's been fingered in a years-old murder . <p> " There 's this fleeting , dumbfounded look that they get when the realization hits that they 're caught , " he said . <p> When all the witnesses have been identified , the detectives hold what Salemme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10 to 15 days . <p> The department 's fugitive apprehension unit helps to corral the witnesses and suspects . <p> Sometimes witnesses are walked past a suspect to shake him up . Other times their presence is kept a secret . <p> " It 's really fun when it all comes together , " Salemme said . <p> Once the suspect is in place , a detective 's years of interrogation experience come into play . Detectives are famously shy about revealing their techniques . But Thomas McIntyre revealed a few . <p> " You try to be their buddy and talk to them , " McIntyre said . " You kill ' em with kindness . " <p> Detectives will run out to get the suspect a Big Mac or a gyro sandwich  --  anything to make him comfortable . <p> Once they develop a rapport , they wait for a moment of weakness . <p> " One suspect 's thumb would twitch whenever he was asked a tough question , " McIntyre said . " Another suspect would stutter when he answered . That 's when you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never hit a suspect . But he does try to make suspects uncomfortable later in the process . <p> " I might start quietly , moving to the suspect 's right side , " McIntyre said , noting that some research shows that people do not like to be approached from the right . <p> " Sometimes I show a suspect a photo of the victim , usually while the victim was living , to hammer home the impact , " he said . <p> Keane said he never moves in for the confession until the suspect looks at him . <p> " I think eye contact is very important . If the guy is looking at the floor or the ceiling , he is not ready to talk . " <p> What follows is cat-and-mouse game , usually with the suspect denying the killing , then saying he knows who did it , then saying he was an accomplice  --  and finally fessing up to doing the deed . <p> " Nothing is done in eight hours , " Keane said . " It 's not unusual to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> Some recognition <p> But the exhaustion is worth it , especially when a detective hears from the victim 's family after charges are filed . <p> Lillie Conner 's family gave McIntyre and then-Detective Tony Navarrete plaques praising their perseverance in solving her March 28 , 1975 murder . <p> " It has been a long and difficult 29 years , we will never forget what you 've done in helping this family to finally begin the healing process , " their plaques say . <p> Someone had called the cold-case squad after seeing a TV report about the unit . The tipster said the detectives ought to re-investigate Conner 's shooting . <p> They tracked down Conner 's husband , Richard Conner , a former roofer living in a West Side retirement home , who first offered a blanket denial to the detectives before he confessed to shooting her four times with a .32-caliber gun , police say . <p> The motive : he allegedly thought his wife had a boyfriend and was going to leave him . <p> Lillie Conner 's family traveled from Wisconsin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get some recognition , " McIntyre said .
