ENDPAPER After several pairs of house mice determined that my Manhattan flat was a suitable place to raise their families , they gleefully moved in . Rather than scurry furtively along baseboards or hide out until the dead of night , they chased one another in afternoon courtship on my kitchen floor , then brazenly danced up to the table to forage for crumbs . I thought of hantavirus and the Black Plague , yet my first inclinations were kindly : I bought " humane " box traps to capture and relocate my unwanted guests . The next day I found that the mice had taken my bait but had managed not to get humanely caught . Inevitably , though , the squeals and pitter-patter of the burgeoning rodent families increased , and I gave in . Reluctantly , I purchased some deadly spring traps " baited " with yellow bits of perforated plastic . None of my little roommates fell for the faux Swiss cheese ; the mice went on dancing , dancing , dancing .... Next I bought glue traps , resolving to conk the critters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death in a glue trap , I earnestly believe , should disturb any thinking , feeling person . ) I thought of Tom and Jerry , Mickey Mouse , Stuart Little , and Robert Burns 's line about " the best laid schemes o " mice and men . " Guiltily , I set out the dreadful glue traps , along with a few spring traps for good measure , and went to bed . Later that night I was awakened by a knock on the door . Two Masai gentlemen stood at my threshold , dressed in their traditional robes . " Jambo , " said one . " Hello . We beg your pardon for the intrusion , sir , but we understand that you are killing animals here . " " What business is that of yours ? " I bristled . " You live a world away . " " Yes , sir , but we have come on an urgent mission , to show you how to live with your mice . " " First of all , they 're not my mice , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They disturb my sleep , they invade my space , they even defecate near my food . Disgusting . If I do n't stop them , they will continue to propagate , carry in fleas and disease , and displace me from my home . " " Rafiki , " said the other one . " We come as friends . Your people have been visiting Africa for years , teaching us that we must live with our wild animals , that killing them is not always the correct answer . " Now we are returning the favor . If you are bothered by squeaks and footfalls in the night , remember that my family must listen to hungry lions roaring nearby at midnight . And believe me , sir , you do n't know what it is to have your food soiled until an elephant has relieved himself on your vegetable garden . " Suddenly , he pulled a small video camera from the wide pocket of his robe . " Do you mind , sir , if I place a bit of cheese on the counter , so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Most folks back home have never seen the New York City rodents , which are world famous , so I 'm making a documentary . " " Look , Otwani , " said the other excitedly , pointing to the window . " It 's a rock dove , what the locals call a pigeon , just there on that ledge . " The two of them rushed to the window . " My gosh , " one shrieked , " I do n't believe it-squirrels ! " And with that , both ran out of the place , slamming the door behind them . WHAM ! I woke up . One of the traps had sprung .
