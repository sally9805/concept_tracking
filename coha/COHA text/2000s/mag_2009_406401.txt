RED , WHITE AND RENEWED The original Star-Spangled Banner is back , and it 's better than ever  --  stars bolder , stripes brighter  --  the whole flag now encased in its own climate-controlled chamber at the Smithsonian 's National Museum of American History , in Washington , D.C. This massive conservation effort , ten years in the works , was made possible by $31 million in grants from Polo Ralph Lauren , the Pew Charitable Trusts and the United States Congress , among others . " We have always celebrated our Americanness , and this was a way of giving back , " says David Lauren , senior vice president for advertising , marketing and corporate communications for Polo Ralph Lauren , which made the largest single contribution to the project , at just over $13 million . The company actively participates in numerous philanthropic initiatives focused on health care , education and the environment , but saving the flag has been by far its most patriotic pursuit to date . Though it may no longer be waving in the rockets ' red glare , the banner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painstaking handiwork by eighteen textile conservators . They detached the **26;2574;TOOLONG cloth from a decayed linen backing , removed loose dirt with dry cosmetic sponges , cleaned it with an acetone-water mixture and stabilized it by affixing it to a new backing of polyester mesh . But during its nearly 200-year history , the cotton-and-wool specimen has seen worse . Requisitioned in 1813 from flag maker Mary Pickersgill by Major George Armistead , it served as a garrison marker for Fort McHenry , outside Baltimore . It endured not only a daylong assault by the British Navy in the War of 1812 but also endless snipping by caretakers seeking souvenir swatches for the families of soldiers killed in the Battle of Baltimore , as the siege became known . Even the fifteenth star was removed as a keepsake . The famous textile constitutes one of the highest-profile artifacts to be conserved through Save America 's Treasures , a public-private partnership program founded in 1998 by then first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton . ( Other relics being restored under the program include the only surviving architectural model of the World Trade Center @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eleanor Roosevelt , in Hyde Park , New York . ) It was at one of the very first meetings for Save America 's Treasures that Polo Ralph Lauren became involved in saving the Stars and Stripes . " The flag reminds us that we are part of American history , " says Lauren . " We 've given it new life that we hope will keep it going for another 200 years . " To learn more about the project , read The Star-Spangled Banner ( Collins ; $29.95 ) , published in advance of the flag 's reinstallation at the Smithsonian last fall . americanhistory.si.edu ; **25;2602;TOOLONG . SUZANNE GANNON LINCOLN MEMORIALS Although Illinois may be the Land of Lincoln , the whole of the American landscape owes its identity to the sixteenth president , whose bicentennial is observed this year . Throughout the country , the birthday has fostered a creative ferment . " The Lincoln renaissance began with the run-up to the bicentennial , but it has been invigorated as never imagined by the ascent of Barack Obama , " says the prolific Lincoln scholar Harold Holzer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schuster ; $30 ) , is among the first and most influential acknowledgments of the anniversary . " Symbolically and realistically , Obama helps America complete what Lincoln at Gettysburg called the country 's ' unfinished work ' : racial reconciliation . " In Lincoln 's first inaugural address , in 1861 , he spoke of " the mystic chords of memory " that unite Americans . That mystical ( decidedly not mythic ) notion of a collective body united for a cause that Lincoln believed would " swell the chorus of the Union " is the official theme for the Ravinia Festival 's celebration of Lincoln 's 200th birthday . Ravinia , the suburban Chicago-based summer music series , commissioned two works to mark the occasion : jazz composer Ramsey Lewis has written a piece , debuting June 12 , for jazz ensemble that combines sung and spoken words , and choreographer Bill T. Jones , recently a Tony Award winner for his work in the musical Spring Awakening , has created Fondly Do We Hope  --  Fervently Do We Pray for the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And just as Lincoln is remembered in word , song and performance , so is he in bricks and mortar . In February , Ford 's Theatre , in Washington , D.C. , reopened after an eighteen-month renovation . The very place where Lincoln was assassinated , on April 14 , 1865 , is now equipped with a museum and a program of plays about the American experience , befitting a president , says Holzer , who recognized " the limitless possibilities of the American dream .
