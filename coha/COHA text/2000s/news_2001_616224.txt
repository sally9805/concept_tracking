<p> It 's not an image readily linked to Gwinnett County . <p> Tall buildings with Class A office space . Condominiums , townhouses . Light rail and buses . <p> Throw in some executive housing , a mall or two or three , a civic center and arena , and county officials and business leaders believe you have a development cocktail that will create an urban center in the middle of suburbia . <p> County Commission Chairman Wayne Hill envisions the area surrounding I-85 and Sugarloaf Parkway as the " downtown " of Gwinnett , an anchor for the community and a place to give Gwinnett residents a sense of identity . <p> " Baltimore is only 37 miles from Washington , " Hill said . " Will it look like Baltimore or Washington ? It will probably look like neither . We 'll see a time where people do n't come to downtown Atlanta to work or shop . It could take 10 , 20 , or 50 years , but this area is going to become a destination . I think the citizens are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's future urban core is projected to run along I-85 tapering off around Gwinnett Place Mall , Ga . 316 , Lawrenceville- Suwanee Road and Old Peachtree Road . <p> Hill and other county leaders have talked about the urban core idea before and now have begun taking steps to move the dream along  --  including creating a Community Improvement District in the I-85/ Sugarloaf Parkway area and embarking on a study to help ease the county 's transition to its urban future . <p> Some question whether Gwinnett County needs a downtown-like district , what shape it will take and whether it will hurt existing neighborhoods . <p> County leaders , though , say it 's inevitable that a new urban center will develop on the I-85 corridor . Richard Tucker , president of the Gwinnett Chamber of Commerce , said several factors will make the area the business center of the county . <p> " It 's geographically almost in the center of the county , " Tucker said . " The I-85 and Sugarloaf Parkway corridor has good infrastructure . It has park and ride lots so you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's a natural . You have large tracts being developed into multi-use , Class A office space . I see it as a Perimeter Center or Galleria or Northpoint area . " <p> It could become more than just a business center , said Erick Collazo , vice president of development for the Mills Corp. , which is building an off-price retail and entertainment mall in the area . Collazo envisions a bustling area where businesses , retail shops , malls and restaurants are active during the day , and where the civic center and a planned new arena , restaurants and executive housing and high-density residential projects thrive at night . <p> The transition from suburban to urban is made feasible by the alignment of key elements , observers say . <p> In 1997 , Crescent Resources built Sugarloaf Country Club , a subdivision of homes priced at $1 million-plus . That is attracting Class A office space , such as the M.D. Hodges ' projects straddling I-85 near Sugarloaf Parkway . The 416-acre mixed used development includes residential , commercial and office buildings . <p> Hodges ' brain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , inter-connecting walking trails and green space . <p> At the same time , nearby apartments and existing suburbs are providing a labor and management pool to help staff the offices , and the wave of businesses expected to follow , such as retail stores and restaurants , said Collazo . <p> Mills is building a 1.4 million-square-foot mall , called Discover Mills , at I-85 and Sugarloaf Parkway . And the county is spending $91 million to expand the Gwinnett Cultural and Civic Center to include a 310,000-square-foot arena . <p> Underneath it all is infrastructure to keep it going . <p> " North Fulton is in a moratorium because of a shortage of waste water capacity , " said Michael Pelt , executive vice president of M.D. Hodges . " Gwinnett has had the foresight to anticipate the growth there . They 've set the stage for north Gwinnett to be the major office market . " <p> Frank Stephens , deputy director for Gwinnett 's Department of Public Utilities , estimated the county will spend $1 billion in sewer and water improvements by 2005 , including about $700 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recycling systems . <p> Similarly , the state and the county highway departments have improved intersections along the I-85 corridor and arterial roads into the area . <p> The county is also about to embark on a Liveability Centers Initiative study to help plan its growth and make sure Gwinnett does n't repeat the mistakes of Midtown and Buckhead . The study , largely funded by a grant from the Atlanta Regional Commission , will focus on the I-85 and Sugarloaf Parkway area . <p> " We want to look at development trends in that area , and look at it with a different set of eyes than in the past , " said Steven Logan , director of planning for the county . " We always looked at development in the county as if it were a transition from rural to suburban . When we get to a critical mass , we need to start looking at the transition from suburban to urban . " <p> That could mean changes in height restrictions , densities and road construction regulations , he said . <p> At the behest of the Gwinnett @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creation of a Community Improvement District for the Discover Mills area . The CID allows businesses within the area to tax themselves for improvements the county might have a hard time funding , including shuttles and streetscapes . <p> The Atlanta Regional Commission supports higher density and mixed-use projects along I-85 , said Dan Reuter , chief of the ARC 's land use division . <p> " It seems like a logical place for it to happen , " Reuter said . <p> The prospect of mixed-use developments  --  with offices , shopping , eating , and residences within a tight area  --  would help reduce reliance on cars , he said . <p> The plan becomes even more pedestrian friendly with the prospect of a bus transit station planned for Gwinnett 's fledgling bus system at Discover Mills , a possible shuttle system through the CID or a light rail through the area , Reuter said . <p> " There is plenty of development pressures to do something conventional , or they can do something innovative , and sounds like they 're trying to do something innovative , " Reuter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with LDR-HNTB of Maryland , said most suburban areas lack a sense of place . <p> " They lack any kind of center , " Paumier said . " People are struck by the lack of identity in the suburbs . Gwinnett 's objectives are right . This will only help make it more liveable . " <p> But , he said , it will take a definite plan , and a willingness to make developers stick to it . <p> " It 's not something that will just happen , " Paumier said . " You ca n't just have a plan and expect people to follow it , because they wo n't . There has to be some leadership , and they have to have the courage of their convictions about doing this . " <p> Not everyone is completely sold on the urban center idea . <p> Lorraine Green , a member of the Discover Mills Citizens Advisory Board , which provides neighborhood input on development in the area , is uneasy about it becoming urban . <p> " It 's a great corridor for office buildings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urban center ? " she said . " Most of us came here to escape urban centers . " <p> She said that with the Thrashers struggling with attendance , it 's unlikely that the Gwinnett arena will land a hockey team and be the draw that it 's being touted to be . <p> Moreover , she said , many businesses clustering around Sugarloaf are simply relocating from other places in Gwinnett , which means they wo n't be adding new value to the county . <p> But , Green said , she 's encouraged by the Liveability Centers plan . <p> Green has an ally in County Commissioner Marcia Neaton-Griggs , whose district includes the proposed urban center . She believes the county needs to plan for the growth . <p> " The problem I have is that we need to be sensitive to the homeowners who were there first , " she said . " But we 're halfway there to an urban center . If this is where it 's going to be , then it needs to be 100 percent planned out , instead of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ / CHUCK BLEVINS / Staff Map : ' DOWNTOWN ' GWINNETT Gwinnett County leaders envision a " downtown " urban core along I-85 with mid-rise buildings , offices , condos , rail lines and restaurants .
