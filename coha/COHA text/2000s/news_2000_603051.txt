<p> The trade of Ken Griffey Jr . to the Cincinnati Reds defies the argument that only a large-market team can afford to acquire a premier talent , given the disparity in Major League Baseball 's current economic structure . <p> But before other small-market teams get their hopes up as a result of the Reds ' good fortune , it must be understood that an unusual set of circumstances made Griffey 's trade from the Seattle Mariners to the Reds come about . <p> " This has been an extremely difficult decision for me , " Griffey said . " I 've only played for the Seattle Mariners since being drafted by them in 1987 . <p> " I want all Mariner fans to understand that my decision does not have anything to do with money or other issues . It is motivated solely by my desire to continue my baseball career on a team closer to my family home here in Orlando , so that I can enjoy more time with my wife and young children . " <p> Griffey had made it clear to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be traded to . As a player with at least 10 years in the majors and the last five with the same team , Griffey had the right to veto any trade . <p> It 's not often that a franchise-caliber player such as Griffey becomes available . When one does , big-market teams with the greatest resources usually get their man . <p> But Griffey shot down that trend in December when he rejected a deal that would have sent him to the New York Mets . <p> Secondly , Griffey insisted all along that his reason for wanting to leave Seattle was his desire to be closer to his family . As it turns out , it could n't have been the money . <p> He was set to become a free agent after the 2000 season . The consensus was that he could have been the first $ 20 million-a-year player on the open market . <p> Instead , Griffey agreed to sign with the Reds at a drastically cut-rate price of nine years , $ 116.5 million  --  after previously turning down an eight-year , $ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the game 's highest-paid player . <p> Homecoming <p> By all accounts , Griffey made it possible for his return to Cincinnati , the city where he was born and raised , and to the team where his father , Ken Griffey Sr. , starred as the right fielder for the " Big Red Machine " in the early to mid- ' 70s . <p> The deal reunites him with his dad , who is the bench coach and likely to be named the Reds ' manager in 2001 . The Griffeys were the first father-son combination to play together when they were Mariners teammates during the 1990 and ' 91 seasons . <p> Griffey makes his home in Orlando with wife Melissa , son Trey , 6 , and daughter Taryn , 4 . The perennial All-Star now gets to spend spring training in Sarasota , Fla. , much closer to home than the Mariners ' spring training quarters in Peoria , Ariz . <p> " I do n't think there 's any question that this is a unique situation , " Pittsburgh Pirates general manager Cam Bonifay said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background of Ken Griffey Jr. , where he grew up and where his father played . I 'm sure with his father being on the coaching staff , that led to his decision . " <p> Although Bonifay does n't view the trade as a sign the playing field is leveling for small-market teams , he hopes sweeping powers recently granted to Commissioner Bud Selig will ultimately lead to competitive balance . <p> " I do n't see it changing yet , but with the power ownership gave to Bud to do what he views is in the best interest of baseball , I would hope we will see a change , " Bonifay said . <p> That sentiment is shared by Kansas City Royals general manager Herk Robinson , whose team 's $ 25 million payroll made a trade for Griffey unthinkable . <p> " I do n't know what Cincinnati 's ( financial ) situation is , but they apparently made this deal work , " Robinson says . " I 'm sorry to see him leave the American League . Seattle was always a big draw here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trade , the game 's three premier home run hitters  --  St. Louis first baseman Mark McGwire , Chicago Cubs right fielder Sammy Sosa and the Reds ' Griffey  --  now all play in the National League Central division . The three teams meet a total of 38 times in the 2000 season . The Cardinals open the season against the Cubs and end the season against the Reds . <p> " Our fans will get to see a future Hall of Famer , " Bonifay says . " Overall , it 's good for the National League . " <p> Griffey is the greatest sports figure in Cincinnati since Pete Rose . And at age 30 , with 398 homers after 11 seasons , he 's the player who all-time home run king Hank Aaron says has the best chance of breaking his record of 755 homers . <p> " I still think he has a very good chance of doing it , " Aaron said Thursday . " If he continues on the same path , he 's going to surpass all the records . " <p> Aaron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing in a new league , but he does n't think that will deter him . <p> " He does n't know the pitchers as well in the National League as he does in the American League . But give him a half a year or so , and he 'll find the same success in Cincinnati that he 's had in Seattle . <p> " This kid is a baseball player . He was raised in a baseball family . He would have been able to excel in any era . " <p> Seattle 's loss <p> The Mariners wished Griffey well Thursday , thanking him for 11 years as Seattle 's unquestioned franchise player . The Gold Glove center fielder had been with the organization since Seattle made him their No. 1 overall pick in 1987 . <p> " We might not have baseball here ( in Seattle ) if it were n't for Ken , and we might not have Safeco Field , " said Chuck Armstrong , the Mariners ' president , speaking of the team 's ballpark that opened last July . <p> Now , Griffey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which includes a ballpark set to open in 2003 . <p> " The last time I put on this uniform , I think I was 8  --  for a father-son game , " said Griffey , putting on a Reds jersey and cap at a Cinergy Field news conference after being flown to Cincinnati on Reds owner Carl Linder 's private jet . <p> " This is something I dreamed about as a little kid , being back in my hometown where I watched so many great players , " he said . <p> Word of Griffey 's arrival spurred an immediate surge in Reds ticket sales Thursday . On Internet auction sites , Reds opening-day tickets were going for five times face value . The better seats were going for as much as $ 400 . <p> The Reds believe he 'll be worth about $ 3 million to $ 7 million alone in ticket revenue this season , not to mention what his talent both defensively and offensively will mean to a club already on the verge of contending for a title . <p> " Unfortunately , we lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 've got to give up something great to get something great , " Reds shortstop and captain Barry Larkin said . <p> Although it does n't happen often , Griffey is n't the first superstar player to be traded . <p> Wayne Gretzky , Joe Montana , Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Wilt Chamberlain are other stars traded in their primes who continued to have success with their new teams . <p> Still , few athletes have had more leverage in dictating their future than Griffey was able to exercise in forcing the Mariners to trade him to Cincinnati . <p> " I certainly never had that kind of leverage , " Aaron said . " I 'm happy for him . He gets to go home where he feels comfortable . There 's nothing wrong with that . Taking nothing from Seattle , I think playing in Cincinnati is going to help him become an even bigger star than he already is. "
