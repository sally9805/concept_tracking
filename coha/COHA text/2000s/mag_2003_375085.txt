You hear that marketers are learning to portray aging baby boomers more realistically . But how often do you see an ad that features thickening middle-age Americans ? Hardly ever  --  and that 's why you will probably notice the new $16 million TV ad campaign by Curves Intl. , the franchising phenomenon that has opened more than 5,400 gyms for women in the 50 states , Canada and six other countries . Commercials for Curves show real women  --  think " before " not " after "  --  slogging through their workouts . What 's also different about Curves  --  and why its business model is even more intriguing  --  is that it ignores the received wisdom about luxury-obsessed boomers . Curves ' gyms are small , simple workout joints , often in strip malls , that cater to overweight women who have never worked out . They offer only one service : a tightly structured , 30-min. circuit-training workout on eight to 12 exercise machines . A recorded voice tells you when to move to the next machine . Most locations are open just seven hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or fruit smoothies . You walk in , follow the drill and leave . <P> Women  --  mostly 30 and up  --  love it . Without much fanfare , the 10-year-old , privately owned Curves has become the world 's largest fitness franchise , measured by locations . It accounts for a quarter of U.S. gyms and pulls in about $750 million a year from almost 2 million members , according to founder and CEO Gary Heavin , 48 , of Gatesville , Texas . Franchises are launching at a rate of nearly 200 a month . <P> Heavin spent nothing on advertising until this year , another way he has bucked the fitness industry 's model . And even his franchisees have not spent much  --  a few hundred dollars a month typically  --  touting their locations . That 's because Curves customers , generally ignored by the 1990s fitness frenzy that raced to reel in the prized 18-to-34 demographic , have spread the word almost evangelically . " What Curves has done is broken through the perception that you have to be fit , coordinated and thin to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of research for the International Health , Racquet and Sports Association , the industry 's largest trade organization . " They 've carved out a niche within the population that had never been served . " <P> Heavin also made it convenient and cheap to set up and run a franchise , which has inspired thousands of first-time entrepreneurs , many of them women . Angie Holding , 56 , of Wichita , Kans. , had fought a lifelong battle with fat and watched her three daughters and granddaughter do the same . In 2000 a fit-looking friend pointed her to Curves . " I 'd never exercised in my life , " Holding says , but she found Curves ' atmosphere  --  women in sweat pants rather than Spandex  --  appealing . She joined after her first visit . And at $29 a month ( fees range from $29 to $49 , based on location ) , it did n't crunch her finances .
