Memory makes us who we are . And because it is our identity , we worry about it , fretting if we ca n't remember the name of someone we just met  --  or know well  --  getting upset when we ca n't recall where we put our keys or left the car in the parking lot or whether we mailed the phone bill . We walk into a room and halt in midstride , the purpose forgotten . These annoying things happen to most of us eventually , and for a simple reason . Just as the body changes over time , so does the brain . " On any intelligence or memory test , " says University of Chicago gerontologist Michael Roizen , " we lose , on average , 5% of our capability for every decade after 30 . " <P> As scientists discover more about the mysterious workings of the brain , it is encouraging to learn that many age-related changes can be slowed , including the decline of memory . The first step is to understand how memory works . Our head does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A single memory is made of tiny pieces of information accumulated and stored over time . Those bits are held in a complex network of some 100 billion neurons , or nerve cells , that can make thousands of connections with other cells in the brain . Subsystems within the cortex handle specific things like names , sounds , textures , faces and smells . Say the word dog , and the busy brain fires up a host of images , sensory impressions and emotions , then reconstructs a specific , unique memory . <P> The connections between neurons  --  the synapses  --  are formed on branchlike structures called dendrites . In a normal , healthy person , these can gradually shrink over time , slowing the process of recalling information and leading to those familiar lapses called " senior moments . " Memory gridlock is bothersome , but , says Johns Hopkins neurologist Barry Gordon , " what most people complain about is not that serious at all . They 're probably not going to get Alzheimer 's ; they just care more about forgetfulness as they get older . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about their memory come to the Pisgah Institute for Psychiatry and Education in Asheville , N.C. , psychologist Ed Hamlin gives them standard tests for visual and verbal memory , delayed recall and delay in attention and concentration . For most , the results are reassuring : their memory is not only good , it exceeds the average for their age . <P> But what about those times when they experience a total blank ? Says Hamlin : " A number of problems are not problems with memory at all . They are really problems with your attention . " There are three basic steps in memory : registration , retention and retrieval . They occur sequentially ; if new information is n't taken in ( registered ) , it ca n't be stored . Focusing on incoming material , whether heard , seen or read , helps implant it in memory . Psychologist Cynthia Green advises students in her memory classes at New York City 's Mount Sinai Medical Center that " often what we think we forgot we really did n't ' get ' in the beginning .
