THE MARKER FAMILY With decades of World Cup wins and one of the most innovative devices around ( the Piston , see " Hydraulic Vibration Management , " above ) , it 's no surprise that Marker is the partner of choice for these four ski manufacturers . Marker 's flagship product , the Comp 14.0 Piston Control Turbo ( $425 ; not shown ) can be mounted a la carte to any " flat " ski ( a ski without a prescribed binding ) . 1 ) The Blizzard IQ 4.12 ( $1,150 with Sigma X-Cross Pro IQ ski ) utilizes a Piston-less , Marker-manufactured toe- and heelpiece unit that slides directly into the ski 's top sheet and is affixed with a single center screw . Both toe and heel float freely  --  and without the interference of a plate , Blizzard says , body-to-ski energy transfer is efficient and immediate . 2 ) K2 's Marker Comp 14.0 Piston Control IBX ( $1,250 with Apache Recon ski ) takes advantage of the vibration-reducing Piston @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving parts . While the heelpiece is directly anchored to a nylon plate , the free-floating toepiece can slide to accommodate a bending ski . K2 's reasoning : Tension builds against the fixed heel as the ski flexes , generating end-of-turn pop . 3 ) Nordica 's N 0312 Ti XB bindings ( $1,195 with Hot Rod Top Fuel XBS ALU Piston Control ski ) come mounted on a plate consisting of two crisscrossed and cantilevered metal platforms . Think of those platforms like diving boards : Weight one end , and the pressure is distributed to the other . It might not make intuitive sense , but trust us , it works . See " Balance Enhancement , " left . 4 ) Like Blizzard 's IQ system , the Volkl Motion iPT with Piston ( $1,115 with Supersport Allstar ski ) is attached directly to rails built into the ski 's body . However , because you 're not stacked on top of a plate and the binding slides on rails , Volkl contends that energy transfer is instantaneous . As for the Piston , it 's attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the toepiece , which extends the binding 's footprint and allows the hydraulics to begin working sooner in the turn . THE TYROLIA FAMILY 5 ) Like Marker 's Comp 14.0 Piston Control Turbo and Vist 's V614 Speedlock Pro , Tyrolia 's HD 14 Railflex ( $350 ; shown on Head i.XRC 1400 Chip Super Railflex II ) can be installed on any flat ski . The toe- and heelpiece unit slides onto a 35-mm-thick Railflex plate and is affixed by a single screw under your boot sole . Both components slide on the plate 's rails during flex , and a diagonal heel and toe release ( but not a true lateral heel release ; see " Lateral Heel Release , " left ) allows your foot to escape in almost any direction . Bonus : Slide either component as much as 15 mm forward and back ( 30 mm total ) to dial in your stance . 6 ) Fischer 's FX12 Railflex2 ( $1,179 with AMC 79 ski ) has a more angular appearance than Tyrolia 's HD14 Railflex , but it shares the same fundamental diagonalrelease @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Fischer decided Tyrolia bindings provided the best feel for its skis . 7 ) Elan 's ELD 12 ( $999 with Magfire 12 Fusion ski ) shares toe and heel technology with Tyrolia 's HD 14 , but attaches to the ski differently . First , Elan laminates a damping plate to its ski and routes a 5-mm-deep cavity in it . Next , a toe- and heelpiece are attached to floating metal plates within the cavity , and the whole unit is ( finally ) attached to the ski 's core . The result : As the ski flexes , the toe- and heelpieces slide to allow a clean , fluid arc . THE LOOK FAMILY 8 ) Look 's PX 12 Ti Lifter ( $265 ; shown on Dynastar Legend 8000 ski ) , like the Tyrolia HD 14 Railflex , Marker Comp 14.0 Piston Control Turbo , and Vist V614 Speedlock Pro , can be mounted to any flat ski . Look redesigned the heelpiece this year , hoping it will deliver more forward pressure than in the past . Both toe and heel are screwed directly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during a turn by a fixed system creates a " dynamic propulsion effect " as the skier exits the turn ( read : more rebound ) . 9 ) The Rossignol Axial2 120 Ti Pro ( $1,049 with Zenith Z9 ski ) is virtually identical to the Look and features the same redesigned heel and multidirectional toe release . The only difference : The toe and heel are joined by a vibrationdamping plate ( consisting of plastic and a rubberlike material ) and , for added carving leverage , the binding is stacked about 5 mm higher than the Look . THE UNAFFILIATED 10 ) Astoundingly , the redesigned Atomic Neox 4.12 ( $299 ; shown on Metron B5 ) is more than a pound lighter than last year 's version , thanks to the use of aluminum instead of steel in the toe- and heelpieces and the track connecting the two . Like the Blizzard and Tyrolia bindings , the Neox features independent toe- and heelpieces anchored at a single point underneath the boot sole . Flex the ski , and the binding does n't interfere . For an additional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4.12 EBM , which has an LCD screen mounted on the toepiece ( see " Digital Assistance , " page 158 ) . 11 ) The Salomon S912 Ti ( $1,075 with Scrambler Hot Pilot ski ) is designed to allow natural ski flex and dynamic rebound out of the turn . Two rockered titanium plates  --  Salomon calls each one a " chassis " ; there 's one beneath the toepiece and one beneath the heelpiece  --  are anchored to the ski with steel pins . Each chassis sits on a rubber pad , which compresses with each turn , letting the ski carve cleanly and providing a dynamic end-of-turn rebound . 12 ) The Vist V614 Speedlock Pro ( $499 ; shown on Vist SL Pro ski ) consists of toepiece , heelpiece , and a beefy aluminum and polyethylene plate that 's based on a decades-old , World Cup-proven design : A coupling of metal and rubber beneath a binding gobbles vibrations , distributes edging pressure efficiently to the ski tips , and generally produces a remarkably smooth , damp ride . Our test of last season 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Flick a lever and you can easily remove toe and heel ; if you have a few pairs of skis mounted with Speedlock plates , you 'll only need one set of toe- and heelpieces . BUILDING A SUPERBINDING We asked a technical illustrator to combine some of our favorite present-day binding features into a hypothetical superbinding of the future . MULTIDIRECTIONAL TOE RELEASE The Present : Look 's Full Drive toepiece is designed to allow your toe to escape in any upward or lateral direction . The expanded toe-wing design also helps to absorb chatter . The Future : In an ideal world , a binding would be smart enough to sense when the skier is slowly falling backward ( even though his foot is still flat on the ski ) and automatically release at the toe . HYDRAULIC VIBRATION MANAGEMENT The Present : As a ski outfitted with a Marker Piston is unweighted , hydraulic resistance slows it from snapping back to its pre-flexed position . Chatter is mitigated ; tips ( and edges ) stay on the snow longer , ready to initiate the next arc . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjust to your weight and skiing style . DIGITAL ASSISTANCE The Present : Last season , Atomic debuted its Neox EBM binding , which features an LCD screen on the toepiece . Step in and the binding performs a quick diagnostic check  --  sending information to the screen via wireless transmitters in the toe- and heelpieces  --  telling you instantly if forward pressure needs adjustment or if you did n't step in properly . The Future : The cost of the technology will come down and it 'll show up on all bindings . BALANCE ENHANCEMENT The Present : Nordica 's X-Balance System employs two crisscrossing cantilevered plates that essentially allow the heelpiece to be anchored in front of the toe and the toepiece to be anchored behind the heel . The system distributes pressure evenly along the length of the ski whether you 're in the backseat or the front , effectively enlarging the ski 's balance point . The Future : As our test results have shown ( Nordica soared after introducing X-Balance last year ) , the future is now . LATERAL HEEL RELEASE The Present : Line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not illustrated ) , in which your heel can eject to the side , even while weighted . This is especially helpful during backward , twisting falls  --  prime time for ACL tears . The Future : At some point , engineers will be able to incorporate lateral heel release without sacrificing downhill performance , but they 're not there yet . THAT WAS THEN Old bindings ( because toe- and heelpieces were screwed directly into the top sheet ) stopped the ski from flexing properly , creating a flat spot and generally overloading the toepiece with pressure ( read : pre-release ) . Today 's high-end bindings " float " on tracks , rails , and sliding plates  --  all to ensure that the ski can carve a clean , fluid arc independent of the binding itself .
