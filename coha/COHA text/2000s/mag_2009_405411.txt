Breast-feeding before classes , staying in on prom night -- the Alaska teenager graduates from high school and talks frankly about the highs and lows of her new ' 24-hour-a-day job ' . One by one , the snapshots flash on an overhead screen to the sentimental strains of " Time of Your Life " by Green Day . Teenagers goofing at prom , huddling in the Alaska snow , spelling out " 09 " with their parka-wrapped bodies . But though the name Bristol Sheeran Marie Palin appears in the May 14 Wasilla High School commencement program , her pretty , lightly freckled face is absent from the ceremony 's slideshow parade of memories . Does it make her sad to have missed out on so much senior-year fun -- to be spending graduation night not with a gang of friends but at home , giving her 5-month-old son a bottle while her extended family plays Eskimo bingo ? She answers with a multitasking mom 's whiff of impatience : " I have other things to worry about . " Bristol Palin , 18 , has logged more of those " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In just the past nine months , she has weathered a partisan and personal presidential campaign that catapulted her mother , Alaska GOP governor Sarah Palin , into enduring celebrity and controversy ; a failed engagement to boyfriend Levi Johnston that played out in the national media ; and , most indelibly , a pregnancy that made her both mother and poster child . Five days after giving birth to Tripp Easton over her Christmas break , she returned to classes at Wasilla High and finished the year with , she says , a 3.49 grade point average . She is uncertain where she will go to college -- she 's thinking of a two-year business program -- but says her near future will include advocating for teen-pregnancy prevention . To that end , she 's sharing graduation day with a PEOPLE reporter who joined the Palins at their five-bedroom Lake Lucille home . She 's opening up in part because she feels that a glimpse into the life of a teen mom -- even one with an amazingly supportive family -- makes her wait-for-motherhood message that much more resonant . " Girls need to imagine and picture their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they have sex , " she says . " Think about the consequences . " Her mom may be governor , but there is no nanny in the Palin house . Bristol gets up -- usually twice during the night -- to feed Tripp , who sleeps in a hand-me-down crib in her bedroom , and she says she has tapped out at least one school paper with her son crying in the background . She pays for diapers and formula by working part-time . And while her parents help a lot , she shops for the whole family 's groceries and does the laundry . ( Babies , she has discovered , make for a lot of laundry . She was the only senior with spit-up on her graduation dress . ) " If girls realized the consequences of sex , nobody would be having sex , " says Bristol , sitting at her parents ' lakeside patio table . " Trust me . Nobody . " Bristol found out she was pregnant at the beginning of May last year , just weeks after her mother , then 44 , gave birth to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bristol 's parents and one of her girlfriends on the worn , leather sectional couch in their living room , the young couple left it to the girlfriend to blurt out their announcement . Bristol later described the moment as harder than labor . " She 'd always been a really good kid , so we did n't worry about " her getting pregnant , says her father , Todd , 44 , who stayed home with the kids while the governor tended to state business in Juneau . Todd says he never talked with Bristol about sex or birth control . " She had enough information out there and enough examples out there . If she had questions , they would be answered . " Bristol herself says she knew about birth control --  " I was definitely educated "  - -  but wo n't say if she used any . ( Levi , in televised interviews that made the Palins both seethe and squirm , said he and Bristol did use condoms , but inconsistently . ) Her message now : a sort of abstinence-first strategy , backed up by education about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but kids should know about everything else too . " Like probably a lot of girls her age , Bristol says she just did n't think about getting pregnant . " I do n't think anyone realizes that it really can happen to you , " she says , snapping her fingers , " like , in an instant . " Bristol has said she never considered having an abortion , and when Levi proposed marriage that summer , she agreed . " I was in love with him , " she says now . Her pregnancy was a fairly open secret around Wasilla but became national news on Sept. 1 , three days after Sarah Palin joined the GOP ticket . Bristol insists she never regretted her mother 's choice to run for higher office . " I was excited for her , " she says . " I knew it was something my mom would enjoy and be good at . " Besides , Bristol adds , she was too busy to Google the sometimes sympathetic , often ugly things said about her . Her relationship with Levi began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 27 . Bristol , home alone with her mother and baby brother , felt contractions the night before . Sarah drove her to the hospital around 11 p.m. and stayed at her side . Levi arrived in the middle of the night and was also in the delivery room for the birth around 6 a.m . " God bless women who do natural childbirth , but it 's crazy , " says Bristol , who did take pain medication . " I felt the pain -- not all of it , but a lot . " Bristol wo n't go into details about why she and Levi split in March --  " things just fell apart , " she says -- but she will say , " I 'm thankful we did n't get married because if it was n't going to work now , it was n't going to work in five years . " She and Levi are now struggling , with the help of lawyers , to resolve an array of issues . " The Palins want child support , and we have no problem with that once he gets employed , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Levi 's attorney Rex Butler . Bristol says that both Levi and his mother , Sherry Johnston , who is awaiting trial on felony charges for allegedly selling OxyContin , have regular time with the baby . " Levi and his family see Tripp , " says Bristol . " I know he loves him . " And so does she . Bristol adores her son , picking him up at every whimper and dreamily calling him " handsome " and " my guy . " But she describes an isolating , regimented life familiar to many a new mother -- but with homework thrown in . She 'd go to class sleep-deprived , either breast-feeding ( " painful , oh my gosh ! " ) or pumping milk before school . " Then come right home and feed him , " she says . Always popular and athletic before , she did n't go out for sports and rarely saw her friends . " You do n't have the same interests , " she observes . Boys ? Clothes ? " It 's like , who cares anymore ? There 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl 's wearing . ' It makes you mature a ton . My life comes second now . " She skipped prom , which " kind of sucked , to tell you the truth , " she says , but " I do n't have that kind of time . And the dress is , like , $400 , and the shoes , hair , makeup -- it 's way too expensive . " But whether she would graduate was never a question -- at least in her mind . " I knew it would be hard , but I would do it . " Her mom was less certain . " I 'm so proud of her , " says the governor , who flew up from the state capitol the morning of graduation . " A couple of years ago , with my son Track , 20 it was a given , expected , nothing dramatic . This was a different story . " With enough prepregnancy credits built up , Bristol took just two courses -- one in " financial literacy , " the other in physical education -- her last semester . This allowed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plus babysitting for other families ( $10/hour ) while her father , grandmother or one of her aunts babysat Tripp . She admits it is " kind of impossible " to buy all the diapers and formula herself , but she 's trying her best . " I do n't like having my parents have to pay , " she says . " It 's punishment enough feeling the guilt of having them help me out financially . " Asked how long she 'll live with her parents , she shakes her head . " That 's a good question . " Postponing his own lucrative summer work on the North Slope oil fields , Todd does the bulk of the childcare for now , while Bristol also hits the gym and tanning salon . " My dad lets me go tanning quite a bit . That 's the one thing I can do . And I try to exercise , " she says . Now that school is over , she relies on a jogging stroller to fill her long days with Tripp . " The mailbox is quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then there 's a park , and we do that a lot , just sort of passing the time , " Bristol says , adding with a sigh , " but that 's only when dishes are done , laundry is done . " She has given up her dream of a nursing career because , she says , she does n't have time for that long a course of study . So she 'll enroll this summer in local college courses toward a possible career in real estate -- depending , all along the way , on free babysitting from family . " I bribe my sister Willow , 14 all the time , like , ' Oh yeah , you can wear my jeans if you watch him , ' " Bristol says with a light laugh . Soberly , she adds , " I know I ca n't do this by myself . I 'm thankful for my huge family . " As for her younger sisters , impish Piper , 8 , helps with diapers , bottles -- and comic relief : teetering around in whatever oversize heels her mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledges , bears the brunt of lessons learned with Bristol 's pregnancy . The consequences of sex " is a much more open discussion now , " says Sarah Palin . " We 're able to tell Willow , ' See ? ' And Bristol 's always telling her , ' Do n't do what I did . ' " For now , her cap and gown are n't even put away yet ( Piper is modeling them ) , and the program from today 's graduation is tossed on the sofa , where Bristol is changing Tripp 's diaper . Two dozen relatives descend on the house for a pizza and bingo party ( Eskimo bingo is played with dice and wrapped prizes ) , but Bristol moves upstairs to get her baby ready for bed . One friend , fellow grad April Morlock , tiptoes over with a gift , a silver necklace with a mother-and-child charm . " In the Valley teen pregnancy is , like , huge , " says April , referring to the Mat-Su Valley where Wasilla sits . " She 's the best mom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same old Bristol . " Yes and no . " Looking back , when we were in sixth grade , I never in a trillion years would have thought it would happen to me out of all of us , " says Bristol , who is quietly rocking Tripp to sleep while her mother wants her downstairs to cut the graduation cake .
