That 's how Bono described the late-night sessions he and the Gateses have when they get together . In an interview with Josh Tyrangiel in Omaha last week , the rapport between the rocker and the tech lords was easy and their curiosity about one another 's worlds genuine . <P> TIME When you first had Bono over for dinner , in 2002 , were you aware of his celebrity or nervous about it ? <P> MELINDA GATES : We 'd certainly never had a rock star to the house before , but the whole reason we got together is because we have this joint cause . To Bono I have to be honest , we kind of came a lot later to your music than other people . <P> BONO : It was fresh not to be seen as a celebrity but as a piece in the puzzle of how we communicate the jeopardy of all those lives  --  and the opportunity of helping if we can just agree on something . It was nice not to be asked how the Achtung ! Baby sessions went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to was in Seattle quite a bit later , and when you came out onstage , our reaction was quite different from your other fans ' . It was more like " Oh , my gosh , does he know that all these people are here watching him ? Oh , I hope he 's O.K. " <P> TIME Are you bigger music fans now ? <P> BILL GATES : I 've always been a music fan . Paul Allen , Microsoft 's co-founder played guitar and made sure I knew all the Jimi Hendrix songs . He 's a real music nut . Not many people create a music museum . Allen founded Seattle 's Experience Music Project . <P> B. : You could n't not listen to music if Paul Allen was your partner . So Jimi Hendrix helped form slipping into a monster-movie voice " the Brain of Bill ! " <P> B.G. : Paul would always say , " Are you experienced ? " And it would mean different things at different times . <P> B. : We can ask Melinda about that . <P> Laughter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with quite serious scientific and political issues , but there must be an emotional toll . Who 's more likely to get angry or frustrated by the situation ? <P> B.G. : World health is something where , when you first realize the situation , it 's pretty stark and even a bit depressing  --  just the magnitude of the inequity . But the more you work on it , you see the improvements that are taking place  --  that decade by decade new medicines are getting there . Maybe not as fast as they should , but you see the trajectory . <P> M.G. : When you visit a new country , you think , Oh , my gosh , maybe this is the time that I 'm going to go somewhere and feel like there 's no hope . But I do n't think we 've ever been in a situation where there has n't been some glimmer . <P> B. : I get angry all right  --  but at myself and our inability to tell the story , to get the news out that this need not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is much more than made up for by the nobility of these people and their entrepreneurial nature . And then you see what a new medicine can do . Three years ago , the idea that nearly half a million Africans would be on antiretrovirals paid for by the U.S.A. was absolutely preposterous . That more than repays the anger . <P> TIME You all have high-profile , time-consuming day jobs . Do you draw clear lines between your day jobs and this stuff ?
