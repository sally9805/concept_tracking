<p> ST . LOUIS  --  Valerie Farris keeps changing her mind about President Bush . <p> She voted for Democrat Al Gore in 2000 . But then she found herself admiring Bush for his handling of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks . Now , though , she worries that he 's too quick to go to war with Iraq and too slow to respond to the troublesome economy . <p> Asked for a word or two to describe the president , the retiree has an on-the-one-hand , on-the-other-hand sort of response . " Powerful , " Farris , 56 , says approvingly . " But not in touch with the average American . " <p> At the midpoint of his term , Bush in some ways has an enviable standing with the public . In two roundtable discussions here , independent-minded voters like those who generally decide presidential elections agreed that he 's a strong leader and an honest man . <p> " A very down-to-earth guy , " says Tim Ladd , 44 , an insurance agent who could imagine taking Bush on a fishing trip . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president since Sept. 11 masks a more complicated and tentative assessment that emerges during an evening 's discussion . They disagree on whether a war with Iraq is necessary , worry about a possible nuclear showdown with North Korea and wonder whatever happened to the search for Osama bin Laden . <p> " We were going to get him , going to get him , going to get him , and now we do n't hear anything , " says Judith Conway , 56 , a retired job recruiter . <p> Most of all , they question whether Bush understands the economic anxiety they feel . Shelia Martin , 57 , a homemaker , notes that her grown son is out of work and has twins on the way . Craig Patterson , 45 , an ironworker , says the construction jobs he depends on are beginning to dry up . <p> " I trust Bush with my daughter , " Patterson says , " but I trust Clinton with my job . " <p> The views of Bush  --  mostly positive but not set in stone  --  contrast sharply with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during his tenure . Then , even mild-mannered voters often had fierce reactions  --  denouncing Clinton as a scoundrel or defending him as a leader who was presiding over prosperity . The views of Bush are less intense and not so firmly held . <p> The sessions Thursday were held to explore attitudes toward Bush as he faces a sluggish economy , prepares for war and lays the groundwork for his re-election campaign . The setting was Missouri , the most reliable presidential bellwether state . It has gone with the winner in every election for nearly a half-century . <p> About half of those who participated voted for Bush , about half for Gore . All sometimes vote for Democrats and sometimes for Republicans . They range in age from 22 to 76 , and their jobs span a similarly broad range : a small-business owner and a teacher , a college student , an electronics engineer , a police lieutenant and a nurse . <p> Their comments offer some comfort both to the president 's defenders and to those who would like to see him replaced in 2004 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he has settled some of the questions they had two years ago about his competence . " I think he 's smarter than what they say , " says Phil Rose , 37 , who trims trees for a landscaping service . " We were told we 'd be seeing ( Vice President ) Dick Cheney every day , running things , and we do n't . " <p> Even so , when they are asked whether Bush would be president today if he had n't been born into a family of privilege and power , not a single hand is raised . <p> " Has he been unemployed ? " Conway asks skeptically . " Has he ever had to worry about how he 's paying his mortgage or his electric bills ? Can he relate to that ? " His proposal to end taxation of corporate dividends draws laughter from the participants . They see it as a boon for the wealthy that is n't likely to affect their finances . <p> " The rich back him . They contribute to his campaign . They 're his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a data analyst at a hospital . " That 's where his priority is . " <p> Unprompted , they wonder in what ways Bush will turn out to be his father 's son . Farris says she worried when the younger Bush was elected that he , like his father , would preside over a recession without doing enough to combat it . Carol Dattoli , 64 , says she gets the feeling that he 's trying to finish a campaign the elder Bush started against Iraq 's Saddam Hussein . <p> What word or two comes to mind when they think about the president ? <p> " Conservative , " says Bill Hilgeman , 55 , co-owner of a small business that sells janitorial supplies . <p> " Hungry to fight a war , " says Aaron Fischlowitz-Roberts , 22 , a student at Brandeis University in suburban Boston , home on break . <p> " Disappointment , " says Angie Williams , 37 , the head of alterations at a Lord &; Taylor store . <p> " Oil , " says Steven Ray Parker , 53 , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " says Vernon Dunn , 64 , an electronics engineer . <p> " He 's the president , good or bad , " says Sheila Henson , 47 , the office manager at a computer software firm . <p> They are n't yet sure how good a president Bush will prove to be  --  fittingly , perhaps , in the Show Me State . They want to see what happens with Iraq and whether the economy rebounds . Of 22 participants , just one already has decided to vote for Bush in 2004 and one against him . No one else is ready to say . <p> " You 've got to see who 's running , " says Joseph Brown , 32 , a cable TV installer , " and how he 's finishing out his term . " <p> The memory of Sept. 11 looms over the discussion , shaping priorities and fueling fears about the vulnerability of the nation and its economy . For some of them , the sense of possibility in the late 1990s , when the world was at relative peace and the economy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peril . <p> For that reason , some want to show unity behind Bush , to give him the benefit of the doubt . " I do n't want to judge him now , " says Stuart Allen , 27 , a computer programmer who is between jobs . " Right now I just want to support him because I want him to protect us , because he is our president . " <p> Asked what their biggest concern would be when they vote in 2004 , some said the traditional top issues : education , health care , the economy . But about one-third said " stability , " in one form or another . They 'd embrace Bush if he could deliver safety in a dangerous world . <p> " Things are fairly tightly woven together , " Henson says . " I 'd like to see economic stability , and I 'd like to see world peace  --  just an overall stable environment . " <p> " It 's very fragile , " Kathleen Callahan , 58 , a teacher , agrees . <p> " I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worry about what she has to look forward to .
