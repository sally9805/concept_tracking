SANTO DOMINGO , Dominican Republic  --  A midmorning workout on a barren field during a bright Friday in March provides a picture of the dreams baseball engenders in this impoverished country of 9.5 million people . <p> About 20 teenagers who look like they belong in a high school are instead honing their baseball skills under the supervision of a 22-year-old former prospect named Alex Roche . <p> " There 's a lot of kids like me who do n't have a father or mother , " says Roche , whose career as an outfielder did not take off , " and the only thing you know how to do is play ball . " <p> Like his charges , Roche is hoping to make a living at the game , not as a player but as a " buscon , " a combination of independent scout and street agent . They are an integral part of the $90 million business of procuring and developing talent in the Dominican Republic , which annually produces the most foreign players in the major leagues , including 10% of players on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ system rife with opportunities for fraud and exploitation , longstanding problems that have come to light in recent months through a series of scandals involving falsified ages and identities , skimmed bonus money and steroid use . <p> The recent abuses were uncovered by Major League Baseball 's Department of Investigations , formed a year ago as a result of a recommendation in the Mitchell Report . The FBI has since gotten involved and concern is growing in the Dominican Republic , where baseball is a passion and a source of national pride . <p> " They put our country in a bad light because people get the impression the country is involved in those kinds of dealings , even though it 's only individuals , " says Dominican baseball Commissioner Porfirio Veras , who was appointed by the country 's president . <p> ' Buscones and business <p> At the root of the problem are the largely unregulated buscones , Spanish for " seekers , " some of whom have been accused of regularly misrepresenting players ages , furnishing them with steroids and scamming to extract large portions of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employees . <p> MLB says its teams spent nearly $60 million in bonuses last year to Latin American players , with $40 million going to Dominican prospects . <p> With an annual gross domestic product of about $9,000 per capita , the Dominican lacks the infrastructure  --  school-affiliated leagues , salaried coaches , equipment , etc.  --  to develop baseball talent at the youth level . <p> Buscones fill that void , providing instruction and sometimes food and lodging to promising young players in exchange for a percentage of their signing bonuses  --  typically about 30% , according to buscones and players in the Dominican Republic  --  if they sign a pro contract . <p> Buscones have found players such as Vladimir Guerrero , Miguel Tejada , Hanley Ramirez and David Ortiz , now major league stars . Ortiz says his buscon got him a signing bonus of $10,000 from the Seattle Mariners a month after they met in 1992 , and he paid $1,000 to the buscon . <p> " They call us that , but we 're really player representatives , " says Andres Martinez , known as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full package : teaching , developing and selling the player . You get them ready for an academy and pro ball , and once they 're at that point , you call the guys from the academies to come see them . " <p> Martinez says about 60% of the kids who join his program come from families that ca n't support them . The buscones earn the trust of the families , and some abuse it . <p> " If they do n't have a conscience , some might say , ' I got you $20,000 ( in bonus money ) . That 's 15 for me and five for you , because I 'm the one who got you everything , " Martinez says . " And they take advantage of the kid . That 's been going on for a long time . " <p> So has the practice of knocking a couple of years off a prospect 's age to make him more attractive to teams and drive up his signing price . <p> In recent years , the stricter verification of ID documents that followed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Dominican players who had lied about their age , including major leaguers Bartolo Colon , Ervin Santana and Pedro Feliz . <p> MLB found age and identity fraud among newly signed Dominican players was up to nearly 60% in 2002 , and the next year it strongly encouraged teams to conduct background checks . The incidence was down to 25% last year , when 561 players were signed , but over the last five years an average of 145 cases of attempted fraud still were detected . <p> " I think that will be further reduced because since May 2008 we began suspending players who are caught for one year , " says Lou Melendez , MLB 's vice president of international operations , adding that the players contracts were voided . <p> Even so , Melendez concedes that , were it not for a tip received by baseball 's Department of Investigations , the Esmailyn Gonzalez case might never have surfaced . <p> The Gonzalez case <p> Gonzalez received $1.4 million in 2006 from the Washington Nationals , who believed they were giving their largest signing bonus for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they got a 20-year-old named Carlos Alvarez Lugo . <p> Alvarez had taken the identity of a relative who was handicapped and rarely seen outside the house as part of an elaborate scheme to make him seem like a better prospect . <p> Three years later , on Feb. 26 , the Nationals fired special assistant Jose Rijo after an MLB investigation revealed the fraud committed by Alvarez . Nationals general manager Jim Bowden resigned three days later but denied any improprieties . <p> " I can assure you , this will have serious repercussions , " Nationals President Stan Kasten said Feb. 18 , the day Alvarez 's deception was revealed . " To say I 'm disappointed does n't begin to describe how I feel . I 'm angry . I 'm very angry . " <p> The case remains under investigation as the FBI looks into whether there has been a pattern of scouts and team officials throughout baseball skimming money from signing bonuses awarded to Latin American players . <p> Rijo , the MVP of the 1990 World Series with the Cincinnati Reds , says he realizes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has raised suspicions but denies any wrongdoing . <p> " The last thing I would do is tell the team a guy is worth five so I can give him three and I can take two . That 's unfair , " says Rijo , who used to rent his baseball complex in San Cristobal to the Nationals before they moved out after the scandal . " My job was to find talent and inform the team . " <p> Rijo and Vizcaino say MLB was at fault in the case , because the Nationals and another unidentified team had conducted background checks on Alvarez and given him the OK . <p> Melendez says the sophisticated nature of the fraud  --  and the money it took to perpetrate it  --  points to the involvement of other parties besides Alvarez . <p> " A lot of people feel it was n't just the player ; it was somebody else , " Melendez says . " Neighbors had been bribed , school officials had been bribed , hospital officials had been bribed . He had indeed been investigated twice , so that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he regrets his actions and their consequences and insists he just wanted an opportunity to play pro ball . Because he signed in 2006 , he is not subject to the one-year suspension , and he is working out at the Nationals academy in Boca Chica in hopes of getting a visa to play in the U.S. minor leagues . <p> He led the rookie-level Gulf Coast League last season with a .343 average in 51 games  --  an impressive statistic if he were a teenager at the time , as the Nationals thought . However , at 23 , his progress would have to be accelerated if he 's going to make the majors . <p> Alvarez wo n't reveal much about who helped him or what happened to the money other than to say he paid 38% of it to his buscones and agents . <p> Asked if he would have been signed had teams known his real age , he says , " I think I might have gotten a chance . But you never know , because when you get to 18 or so , scouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desperate to play that you end up doing something crazy like this . " <p> More such cases might be discovered soon . The U.S. Consulate in Santo Domingo has requested that MLB take a second look at nearly 50 cases of signed prospects whose background checks already had been approved . <p> The Nationals have not specified the reasons for firing Rijo and Jose Baez , their director of operations in the Dominican Republic , but they 're not the only team to take action . <p> The Chicago White Sox fired David Wilder , their senior director of player personnel , in May for what the club called " actions in Latin America that were in violations of club policy and standards . " Wilder was stopped by customs officials leaving a Dominican airport with a large amount of cash , and the FBI is investigating whether that money was skimmed from bonuses . <p> The New York Yankees and Boston Red Sox also fired scouts as a result of MLB 's investigation into skimming and kickbacks . <p> And this might be just the beginning . According to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread and cases might soon pop up in Venezuela , where the system of finding talent is similar to the Dominican Republic 's . The person was not authorized to discuss the subject and spoke on the condition of anonymity . <p> ' Collective complicity <p> Nobody can quantify how much bonus skimming has been perpetrated by scouts and academy personnel  --  typically in cahoots with buscones and sometimes a prospect 's family  --  but there 's a belief among local baseball officials that the practice has been in place for more than a decade . <p> Sports minister Felipe Payano did not return calls seeking comment , but Veras says , " There appears to be a collective complicity , because there 's a lot of money involved and everybody who 's a part gains from it . Buscones do n't work on their own ; they work with somebody else . " <p> MLB officials , who are maintaining a database of buscones to record which ones have presented players with altered documentation , have lobbied for them to be required to register in the Dominican Republic and have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be addressed by the so-called " sports law " currently under review in the Dominican legislature . <p> MLB officials think implementation of the law  --  which also would prohibit teams from signing players from unlicensed scouts  --  would be a significant step in curtailing abuses in the Dominican Republic . <p> " It 's not that they do n't want to do it , " Melendez says , " but like any other poor country , they have more pressing issues , like the economy and jobs for their people .
