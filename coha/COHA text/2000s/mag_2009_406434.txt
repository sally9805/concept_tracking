A Smoother Application New York-based makeup artist Darac knows from his thirty years of experience that brushes can spread loose powder poorly and leave your complexion looking blotchy . So he 's created one , Darac Beauty TourQuam Luxe ( $75 ) , with a magnet in its handle to attract the iron oxides in powder foundations , blushes and bronzers . The soft bristles are like those used for fingerprinting brushes , and they sweep powder evenly across the face without plopping most of it on the first spot the brush touches . daracbeauty.com .

Serums have high concentrations of these skin savers , but we 've never seen one as potent as Dr Sebagh 's Suprme Maintenance Youth Serum . It 's 95 percent " actives , " like resveratrol , an antioxidant derived from red grapes ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ booster . Three to four drops are enough to cover your face , neck and dcolletage . These days hefty prices can give you pause , but this bottle , at $400 for two ounces , will last up to four months and may save you an expensive trip to your dermatologist .

EDITOR 'S CHOICE It 's a Beautiful Day at the Plaza Hair colorist Joel Warren and stylist Edward Tricomi have left behind their East 57th Street salon , with its playful Moroccan decor , and taken over a new , 6,100-square-foot space in the refurbished New York landmark hotel . The inspiration for their latest locale : the storied black-and-white glamour shots of celebrities who frequented the Plaza over the years . Sure enough , I can easily imagine that if a bar and a grand piano were added to the cream travertine walls , dark granite floors and black fiberglass panels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the bustle here today , the sleek salon suits its dedicated patrons , too . My appointment is with Naru , a delightful stylist , for a Fix Strengthening and Renewing Treatment ( $56-$86 ) and a blow-out ( $71-$101 ) , both reasonably priced for such a luxe spot . Sixty minutes later , she is putting the finishing touches on my now shiny hair , and I 'm reassured that the salon has lost none of its warmth or reliable service . Photograph : Warren-Tricomi 's new salon at the Plaza is an inviting retreat . Warren-Tricomi is in good company : on the hotel 's fourth floor is the Caudalie Vinothrapie Spa . Its French founders , Mathilde and Bertrand Thomas , usually set their award-winning spas in vineyards but , in the case of their first U.S. opening , have brought a bit of the vineyard to the spa with a wine lounge , where you can enjoy a glass of wine with spa cuisine ( $45 ) or simply relax and wait for your appointment . I 'm enjoying listening to classical music and snacking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leather couches and warm woods , when my massage therapist arrives to give me a Caudalie Massage ( $165 ) . At the rear of the treatment room and clearly visible through a glass shower stall is a whimsical sculpture of a grapevine planted in river pebbles . Cherrywood accents and slate floor tiles complete this streamlined , peaceful oasis , and I already feel my shoulders unclenching . My therapist checks on the music selection ( classical again ) and the room temperature and handles sensitive points ( " Okay to massage your abdomen ? " ) considerately but without overdoing it . I can tell I 'm in expert hands , and that assessment is confirmed when , midway into the session , I jettison whatever I 've been thinking about and my mind clears . In these somber times , that 's one worthwhile investment return . warrentricomi.com ; caudalie.com . NINA J. JUDAR Must-Dos for April 1 .
