I was the first one who saw her . I did n't hear the door to the English class open , and she stood so still that she did n't even seem to be breathing . I caught my breath , too , and it was as if I had sudden knowledge of a strange place I 'd never imagined . I gripped my hands together so hard that they hurt . It was eight-forty in first period , and Woody McCready was still reading the morning bulletin aloud . He was late finishing it because he 'd argued with Mrs. Munson before he began , and now she 'd make sure the whole class paid . Why did she ask him to read aloud so often ? He hated it , and he did such a terrible job that he embarrassed himself . Mrs. Munson watched me , not Woody . Her eyes were narrow and speculative , and she never seemed to blink . She tapped her big teeth with her pencil . The stranger took one step inside the room , and a quick ripple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He struggled on and stumbled over the word assembly . " Assemaly , " he said . " No , assby . " No one dared laugh . Not yet , at least . " Ass ! " Woody finished triumphantly , and he looked around to see if everyone appreciated his switch from stupidity to colossal wit . He snorted laughter , wiped his nose on the back of his hand , and then saw that he 'd lost his audience . Everyone had turned to stare at the stranger . Immediately I knew that most of the other girls would n't like her , and I was already sorry for her . For one thing , starting school after the semester began was a very bad move . I remembered that from my own experience in fourth grade . The girls had already divided into competing cliques , and they had more fun excluding people than including them . Mitzie Coburn and I were always excluded , Mitzie because she was over-weight and I because ... I did n't really know why . Yes , I did . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no matter how hard I tried to be like everybody else . The biggest reason the new girl was making instant enemies was the way she looked . She was different in every possible way , but she held her head up as if she knew it and did n't care . She wore a long chevron-patterned brown skirt and a thin ivory-colored shirt instead of the jeans and shorts , tees and sweatshirts that all the rest of us wore . The leather sandals on her bare tan feet looked new . Her long , layered hair was precisely streaked brown and blond and looked as if her hairdresser was a computer instead of a human . It was ... strange . Her round dark eyes seemed calm enough , facing a class of unsmiling strangers , and I wondered if she was studying us . She carried a handful of registration papers and a neat brown leather pocketbook . Why was she transferring to Bayhead High now , during the last week of September ? I felt around the edges of her mind , looking for an answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question . Okay . She caught on to me sooner than most . Woody McCready whispered something to a boy sitting in the front row , and both of them laughed . Then he turned to stare insolently at the newcomer in the doorway . I was sure he wanted to seem important and intimidating . Instead , he only looked mean , with dirt-colored eyes and greasy , dark hair . He and his friends always dressed in black , like TV gang members , but nobody dared laugh . Woody could hit hard . Very hard . I hated him so much that when I looked at him , my hands automatically turned into fists . The new girl studied Woody calmly , then looked toward the windows , totally dismissing him . Oh ho , Woody , I thought . This will be fun . Is she someone you ca n't bully ? But you be careful , new girl . You be really careful . Woody is full of ugly surprises . I decided at that moment that I wanted to be the new girl 's friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her . He laughed , as if he 'd been clever . " Come up to the desk , " Mrs. Munson told the girl . " Woody , finish the bulletin and then take your seat . " I felt the entire class hold its breath as the new girl walked toward Mrs. Munson 's desk . Jennifer Budd , a fake blond with eyes like bright blue marbles , our apprentice beauty contestant and especially unloved by Mitzie and me , whispered furiously to the girl next to her but never stopped gawking at the stranger . Jennifer 's jealousy poured out into the room like a sour odor , and the other girls caught the scent . The boys reacted to the girls ' animosity with nervous excitement . They muttered and laughed hoarsely , nudging each other . What a beginning , I thought , pitying the new girl . Wherever she came from must be better than this . Mrs. Munson glanced through the girl 's papers , then said , " People , this is Althea Peale . Althea , sit next to Bridget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl in the red shirt ! " It did n't take much to infuriate Mrs. Munson . A split-second 's hesitation would do it . Althea walked to the empty chair beside me , without flinching when the girls snickered and the boys openly laughed at her as she passed . It was her clothes , her attitude , and her strange hair . And her newness . There was no room for her among these kids . I slid down in my chair and looked out the window at the pale blue sky and the gold and brown trees . I really hated that class , and I 'd always liked English before . Althea 's skirt rustled softly when she sat down . She folded her hands and stared straight ahead . A student aide came in then , carrying a thick brown envelope , and Mrs. Munson told us that our school photo I.D.s were ready . When she passed them out , most of the kids made disparaging remarks , even as they showed their photos around , waiting for compliments . Mitzie and I tucked ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and perfect skin , but she weighed too much . I had light brown hair and my skin was good enough , but I stammered and I was clumsy . I could trip over a dog hair . In the few minutes left in first period , Mrs. Munson plunged into our class work . When she talked about sentence structure , she sounded as if she might explode into violence any second . If she hated teaching English so much , why did she do it ? Why did n't she teach science or math ? Or better yet , why was n't she a prison guard ? Or a burglar ? I 'd heard she did n't have children . I hoped she did n't even have a pet , but I did n't search her mind for answers . She was so mean I did n't want to know what went on inside her thick skull . I was sure she 'd call on me to read my list of adjectives describing weather , and she did . I 'd written " dank " at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he heard it . " Dank , " he whined through his nose . " Daaank . " " Would n't ' damp ' be a little less affected ? " Mrs. Munson asked me . She often applied the word " affected " to my work . I had looked it up . It meant phony and pretentious . She 'd hurt my feelings , of course . Was n't that what she was all about ? Fortunately , the bell rang before I could stammer a reply . Althea , Mitzie , and I kept our seats while everyone else bolted for the door . Woody knocked Sam Pendergast into the cork bulletin board and then kicked his feet out from under him . " Hey , quit it ! " Greg Thompson yelled at Woody , risking ending up on the floor with Sam . But Woody was already shoving his way through the door , his elbows jabbing and his thick black boots stomping on everybody 's feet . Sam waited in silence until most of the crowd disappeared before he got up and pushed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked him . Sam shrugged wordlessly and hitched sideways out the door , all elbows and knees and misery . Mrs. Munson had seen what happened , but she 'd left without even changing her surly expression . We three girls looked at each other . " What class do you have next ? " I asked Althea . " History , Room 202 , " she said , consulting her schedule . Her voice was quiet but surprisingly rough , as if she had a cold . Or had been crying . But her round dark eyes were clear . " Mitzie and I have trig , down the hall , " I told her . " Your room is at the other end of the second floor , Althea . You 'd better hurry . I hope we see you later , maybe at lunch . " We pushed out into the hall and separated . The noise level was too great for conversation , so Mitzie and I hurried along , exchanging smiles and shrugs . After we 'd settled ourselves in trig , Jennifer and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whispered and giggled . Their thoughts were jagged , spraying from them like small bits of broken glass . Beside me , Mitzie sighed and pulled her dark hair down over her face . I thought that she was trying to hide at least a small part of herself . Jennifer and company made her miserable . Knowing that kept them happy . I thought about the new girl again , making her way late to class , dressed in her weird clothes . There was something about her , something new and unscarred , that was certain to attract attention . Greg Thompson skidded in , almost late again . He bent down beside me and said , " Hey , how about the new girl ? I like her . " Then he threw himself into his seat behind Mitzie , pawed his curly brown hair with a big , square hand , and grinned obligingly . " Are you working in the store tomorrow ? I am . " I did n't have a chance to answer , because the teacher began writing on the board and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a start . At lunch , after Mitzie and I had begun eating at our usual corner table , we saw Althea come into the cafeteria . Silence enveloped the room as she slowly walked through it . She looked around as if she was studying faces . " I 'll ask her to sit with us , " I told Mitzie and the other girls and I got up so quickly that I nearly spilled my milk . Althea saw me and waited . " There 's room at our table , " I said . " Unless you 're meeting someone . " " Thank you " she murmured in her strange , hoarse voice . I introduced her around , although two of the girls already knew her from morning classes . She nodded at everyone , then folded her hands on her pocketbook . " Are n't you going to eat ? " Julie asked . " I 'm not hungry , " Althea said . I pushed my bag of grapes toward her . " Would you like some ? " " No , thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . While we ate , she looked around the cafeteria slowly , studying faces again . " Are you looking for somebody ? " Mitzie asked " Can we help you find someone ? " " No , thank you , " Althea said . Mitzie held a chocolate chip cookie out to her . " Try this . Mom makes the best . " Althea shook her head wordlessly . Mitzie shrugged and offered the cookie to me . " Yum , " I said , taking it . After a while Mitzie and Julie began telling jokes , and I nearly forgot Althea . When I looked back at her , she was sitting erect but her eyes were closed . I would n't have been surprised to see tears running down her face . She gave off waves of grief , a high , cold tide of it . " Are you all right ? " I asked . Althea 's black eyes opened abruptly . For a moment I was frightened out of my senses , because what I saw in her eyes was so terrible . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down , and a mother 's anguish . " I 'm fine , thank you , " Althea said . " I need to find a restroom . " " Go out the main cafeteria door and turn right , " Mitzie said . " Do you want company ? " Althea shook her head , gathered up her pocketbook , and excused herself When she was out of hearing , Mitzie said , " I think she 's crying . " " Poor kid , " Julie said . " Being new in school is rotten . And she has funny clothes . But I 'm crazy about her hair . It makes me feel like petting it . " We all laughed . Julie was homely and freckled , but she was so sweet , like Mitzie . That was the nicest thing I could say about anyone , that she was as sweet as Mitzie . Althea turned up again in my last period art class . The teacher sent her to the drawing board in the back corner , between the last window and the supply cupboards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the kids on that side of the room were juniors , but there was no room left for Althea on the lowly sophomore side . I wished I sat by Jordan . I saw him bending over his drawing board , never looking up no matter what . He was the saddest person I 'd ever known . " Bridget ? " Miss Ireland asked . My head jerked around . " Yes ? " She was standing next to me , smiling . She 'd been talking to me , but I 'd been gawking at Jordan as if I 'd never seen him before . I felt that way every time I saw him . " Will you finish your watercolor in time for the art fair ? " she asked . " I 've got enough time , " I said . Miss Ireland smiled again . " I 've put aside a mat for you . Just tell me when you want it . " I was dazzled by her attention and afraid my work would n't live up to her expectations . " I saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's so proud of you . " I grinned , pleased . Miss Ireland moved on . She stopped by Greg Thompson 's desk to admire his drawing and laugh at something he said . He was a clown , but he was the best artist in school . I was second best , thanks to the encouragement I 'd had from Miss Ireland and my aunt . They acted as if they thought I was wonderful . Most of the time I felt as if I were on a speeding bus that did n't have a driver . If I had n't had Aunt Cait , I would n't have known what to do . I could tell her what I thought about anything and not worry about ridicule or blame . Unfortunately , our friendship was one of the things that drove my mother crazy . Sometimes  --  but not often  --  I wished I could be like Jennifer Budd , for the safety it would bring . Oh , to be what everyone expected teenage girls to be , vain , shallow , noisy , and sneaky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was thinking . And if anyone did , I 'd be sly enough to make something up . I looked out the window and saw that a mist had drifted through the trees on the school lawn . It collected on colored leaves and dripped slowly , glimmering in the golden afternoon light . Half a dozen tree spirits bathed their small pointed faces in it , and when they saw me watching , they flickered their opal wings and disappeared within the shelter of the peach and gold leaves . Summer was over . I felt the stranger , Althea , staring at me , and startled , I met her dark gaze . She knows , I thought . She knows about me . But I could n't know about her , because she 'd learned to shut everyone out . And that was a very strange thing . I tried to concentrate on the exercise in perspective Miss Ireland had given us , but my mind wandered . I doodled small figures on the corner of my paper , the little tree spirits I 'd seen bathing their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Ireland said . She was back at my elbow again , smiling while she studied the winged spirits . " Have you drawn them before ? " She startled me and I did n't think before I acted , so I turned to look out the window at the nearest tree , where I 'd seen the spirits . " Oh ! " she said , flushing as if she was guilty of something . She moved on and did n't glance back . I stared after her , embarrassed . She probably believed I was crazy . She stopped to talk to Jordan . He liked painting more than drawing , and lately all he 'd been drawing in class was his old dog that had died during the summer . No matter what the assignment , Jordan drew Mikey . Things were bad at his house . Althea held a pencil lightly while she looked out the window at the colorless sky . Greg Thompson laughed at something the boy next to him said . Mitzie cleared her throat , then coughed . She was allergic to eraser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my paper and added another bathing tree spirit to the cluster I 'd drawn at the edge of my paper . The bell rang , and I took a deep breath . Time to start home . Althea was the first one out of the room , gone before I could call out , her skirt and hair fluttering behind her . I 'd wanted to talk to her when we 'd have more time , find out where she lived , and try to make friends . I did n't know why I had goosebumps on my arms .
