The British Medical Journal published a landmark study in 1954 that helped establish the link between smoking and lung cancer . Last week the journal published a 50-year update of the massive research project on which that paper was based  --  the longest smoking study ever  --  which calculated that cigarettes took an average of 10 years off the lives of smokers who never quit . The study , which began in 1951 and ended in 2001 , followed 35,000 male doctors and found that kicking the habit reduced mortality rates on a sliding scale . Quit at 60 , and you gain three years of life ; quit at 30 , and it 's almost as if you never smoked . Take it from Sir Richard Doll , 91 , who quit at 37 and co-authored the original paper as well as last week 's update . While 50-year studies are rarities in medicine , researchers who survive them are even rarer .
