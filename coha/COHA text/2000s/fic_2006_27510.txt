Boston December 1 , 1805 Any old port in a storm . That 's what I 'm thinking as I carefully weave my little boat through the ships in the crowded harbor . I 've seen many ports and I 've weathered many storms and good old Boston Harbor is looking right good to me at this moment . Hmmm . . . be wary , though , girl . There 's three British warships lying over there at Long Wharf . Got to steer clear of them , for sure , as the men on board could have heard of the price that 's on my poor head and might be of a mind to try to collect it . My head , that is . . . Imagine that . . . a reward of two hundred and fifty pounds , and all for the body of one insignificant girl --  a full Royal Navy captain 's pay for a year , and would n't some lucky sailor like to nab that ? As I clear the end of Long Wharf , I pull my cap further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind me , Sirs . Just a simple fisher lass heading home , nothing more . Now I start working my way over to the land . I 'm remembering that there 's an open bit of gravelly beach between Howard 's and Codman 's wharves , and that is where I 'm of a mind to land . The wind is fair and my sail is drawing well and I 'm cuttingneatly through boats and ships that are anchored out . I pull in a bit closer and look over at the warships . They could see me from where they lay , if they cared to look . But who cares about some fishmonger 's dutiful daughter out plying her family 's trade ? That 's what I 'm thinking . Or hoping . But , oh Sirs --  you , my fellow countrymen and fellow sailors --  if only you knew what has happened at Trafalgar , you would not be sitting so peacefully here . It 's plain they have n't gotten the word yet . Codman 's Wharf passes on my port side and I throw the tiller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear and feel the scrape of the bottom on my keel , I loose the sail and the Morning Star slips her nose up elegantly onto the beach . Pretty neat sailing , old girl , I 'm thinking , patting her gunwale affectionately . I know it 's been a long trip for the both of us , from Trafalgar to here , that 's for sure , and now you just rest . For a moment I sit there in wonder at being back in Boston again , then I go forward and loosen the halyard , letting the sail and its booms collapse to the deck . I 'm about to gather it in and wrap it up , when there 's a noise behind me and I spin around in alarm , my shiv out of my vest and in my hand . By God , they 're not going to take me without -- But it is nothing but a boy . A very ragged and dirty boy , to be sure , but just a boy . He is the very picture of a wharf rat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once been one myself , back when I lived under London 's Blackfriars Bridge as a member in good standing of the Rooster Charlie Gang of Naked Orphans . Blackfriars Bridge was real close to the docks on the Thames , so , yes , I know this kind of boy quite well . " Need some help , Missy ? " he says with hope in his voice . It 's plain from the ribs sticking out under his too-short shirt that he has n't eaten in a while and he looks real willin ' to earn a penny . Well , I ca n't argue with that , as I 'm all for youthful spunk and enterprise . I slide my knife back in my vest . " Well , maybe . Help me stow the sail . " He leaps on board to help me wrap the sail around the boom , and we lash it down tight with the mainsheet and secure it to its stay post . " There , Missy , tight as a drum . Anything else ? Polish your brass , shine up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is younger than me --  maybe thirteen , fourteen . His hair is held back with a piece of old twine and I can see both his knees through the rips in the trousers that end raggedly at his calves . He is , of course , barefoot . " You can see , young Master Wharf Rat , that the Morning Star has neither brass work nor brightwork , nor do her oars need varnishing , " I say severely , in my best Naval Officer voice , " but you may , if you wish to earn a penny , watch over her till I return , which might be today , or might be tomorrow . If you know a place where she can be moored . . . " " Oh , yes , Missy . See that pier over by the market ? I 'll tie it up there . So many fishing boats go in and out of there that they 'll never notice us . " " All right , " I say . I dig in the purse that hangs by my side and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Go spend this on something to eat first and then tend to moving her . And mark me --  This is the Morning Star and she is a her , not an it . Do you get that ? " He nods . " You can do it by yourself ? " " Oh , yes , Missy , I 'm a thoroughgoing seaman ! I 'll get her anywhere you need her . " I give a quick snort . " Very well , Seaman . . . What is your name , boy ? " " Tanner , Missy . Jim Tanner . " " Why are you not in school ? " I ask , suspiciously . I ca n't let anything happen to the Star after getting her all the way here . " Done with that . Learned all I needed to . I can read and cipher some . That 's all a seaman needs , I figure . " " Who are your parents ? Where do you live ? " " My mother died havin ' me . Dad was lost at sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I sleep under the docks , mostly , sometimes in woodsheds when I can find one that ai n't locked . " He looks a bit defiant when he says this . Hmmm . . . dirt poor but possessed of some pride , at least . " Surely you could find a better place to sleep , up in the town . " " Maybe , but then Wiggins 'd catch me and indenture me to some farmer and I do n't want that . I 'm a seaman , as I told you . " I know the fact that I am dressed in my serving-girl gear is why he 's being as familiar as he is being . Time to put him straight . " Very well , Seaman Tanner , you may carry on with your duties . When I return , you shall see another penny . But I warn you , if you try anything cute , like stealing my boat , then things will go very hard for you . Very hard . " He nods , unconvinced , I know , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to . I decide to convince him of this . " Do you know of a John Thomas ? Smasher McGee ? " I ask , drilling my eyes into his . I name a few more of my more colorful Boston pierside acquaintances . " They are my very good friends , and they would do anything for me --  anything --  including running down , gutting , and making fish bait out of a treacherous wharf rat . Do you take my meaning , young Master Tanner ? " It is plain that he knows at least some of these sterling individuals , for he gulps and nods . " I was n't gon na mess with your boat , Missy , " he says , looking hurt . " I know you were n't , Seaman Tanner , " I say , more kindly now andfeeling a little bit sorry for doubting him , " but I was just making sure . " With that I turn to go down into the cuddy to change . I dive into my seabag and choose my black school dress , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave the hatch open for light . " Turn around , Master Tanner , and face away , " I call out to him . He ducks his head and does an about-face . After I have put on my clothes , I come back up and I look him over . He stands there expectantly , shuffling his feet . I decide to trust him . " I now leave the Morning Star in your hands , Jim Tanner . Take good care of her , for she has taken good care of me . And maybe she will take good care of you , as well . " I put on my bonnet and throw the mantilla over my shoulders . " And , by the way , my name is Nancy Alsop . That is Miss Alsop to you . " With that I once again place my foot on Boston soil and head up toward Union Street . Continues ...
