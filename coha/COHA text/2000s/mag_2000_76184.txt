A five-iron in one hand , two pepperoni sticks in the other , Greg Laugeni clomps across the parking lot at the Yale Golf Course , chewing the fat with his playing partner , John Hardy . Considering that Laugeni weighs 390 pounds and Hardy 530 , there 's a lot of fat to chew . // Laugeni plops down at the temporary nurse 's station that has been set up outside the clubhouse and has his blood pressure taken . When the nurse tells him it 's 158 over 120 , he nearly plotzes . " If you 're right , " says Laugeni , a 36-year-old contractor from Woodbridge , Conn. , " I should have died nine days ago ! " // " Eight , " she says . // Hardy 's turn . A look of incredulity spreads across the nurse 's face . " You 're 200 over 100 ! " she says , flicking the gauge with her finger . " This may be a world record . Have you ever had a cholesterol count ? " // " Cholesterol ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conn . " Lady , with blood pressure this high , what 's the difference ? " // Hardy and Laugeni were in New Haven , Conn. , on July 31 for the Fatty Open , an annual celebration of golf and gluttony put on by the course and its chubby chef , 230-pound Dave Horton . The one-day , four-man scramble is perhaps the only sporting event with a weight minimum : Entrants are penalized 25 cents for every pound less than 250 . It 's also the only golf tournament in which the big prizes go for the highest score on the scale rather than the lowest score on the course . // Before play began each of the 88 golfers , who came from as far away as Florida , was required to sit on a large scale rigged to a forklift . Hardy , Laugeni and the rest of their team weighed in at 1,520 pounds  --  580 pounds more than the four guys who posted the low team score , not that anybody seemed to care much . Hardy 's fulsome foursome took the day 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them was awarded a 50-pound block of butter , a 24-roll pack of toilet paper and a chocolate chip cookie the size of a manhole cover ) , as easily as Hardy took the prize for highest blood pressure ( 10 pounds of pepperoni and a George Foreman Grill ; Hardy was only moderately miffed that the grill did n't come with a car adapter ) . " I 'll never get to be the fattest golfer in the Fatty Open , " groused 265-pounder Mike Guerra . " Hardy makes me look like a pencil-neck. " // Called Hardware during his days , he says , as a defensive tackle at Ole Miss , Hardy is a Victoria Falls of flab . Compared with him , former offensive tackle Laugeni , who overheated so often while playing for Holy Cross that he was dubbed the Radiator , is a mere cascade . // The weights of the quartet 's other two members  --  315-pound Brian ( Happy Tuna ) Marcucio and 285-pound Wayne ( Cracker ) Rydzy  --  seemed feathery by comparison . " It 's flattering to be part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a team photo . " This is the first picture ever taken of me in which I did n't have to try to look thin . " // The remainder of the Fatty field was larded with plump plumbers , stout salesmen , round restaurateurs , portly private eyes , fleshy florists and one overnourished undertaker . " We need an undertaker on site , " said Horton . " Just in case . " Horton came up with the idea for the Fatty Open in 1997 He was out on the links when one of his buddies said , " Will you look at all the porkers out here ! " // " You know , you 're right , " said Horton . " Let 's have a tournament for them . " // Displaying the perseverance of his namesake in the Dr. Seuss classic , Horton somehow cajoled the director of the renowned 74-year-old Yale course into hosting the fatfest . The proceeds help fund research for a Yale Psychiatric Institute study of  --  what else ?  --  eating disorders . " It 's less a tournament than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's not really about golf . It 's about food . " // Horton provides lots of it : Besides a buffet lunch and dinner , each golfer gets a gift bag that includes Oreos , Slim Jims and a pack of Alka-Seltzer . Barbecued franks and burgers await players at the 3rd hole , where hitting closest to the buffet table ( about a 265-yard drive ) gets you a microwave oven . ( In the event of a tie , the ball closest to the mayonnaise wins ; last year , Rydzy claimed the prize after his ball landed in a hot dog roll. ) // Alas , not one of the golfers was female . Horton hopes to have a women 's division , but in three years he has n't had a single applicant . " Women get a little nutty about their weight , " he says . " When guys get big and fat and sloppy , they do n't care . " // Laugeni is living proof of that . He was almost misty-eyed as he recalled the Zen-like state of bliss he reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he became " at one " with 12 lobsters , 72 jumbo shrimp , 14 eight-ounce steaks , three slices of prime rib ( " not slabs  --  you know , thin " ) , a pineapple and three bottles of wine . " My roommate watched me in awe , " Laugeni says . " Then he went into the bathroom and threw up . " // Not surprisingly , Laugeni and Hardy were each assigned his own cart for the tournament . " This course is very hilly , and if those two were in the same vehicle , I 'd be a little nervous about the brakes , " said Horton . " Remember what happened to John Candy in Stripes : During basic training he started running and could n't stop until he reached the next state . " // A light rain is falling as Hardy looms over his ball on the 1st tee . He hits his drive a little chunky ; the low liner makes straight for a flock of Canadas wading in Griest Pond . " The geese are running ! " shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . " John looks like he 's hungry . " // Rydzy 's opening drive bends over a corner of the water hazard before breaching the fairway , and his approach bounds across the wildly undulating green , stopping five feet from the cup . When Laugeni sinks the putt for a birdie , he and Hardy celebrate by banging bellies like Fantasia hippos . The force of the collision causes office buildings to sway in Bridgeport , 20 miles away . // As the portly procession plods uphill to the next tee box , a fellow fatty drives by . " If you see a Maxfli in the rough , " he says , " pick it up for me , will you ? " // " Sorry , " says Laugeni . " I have n't been able to bend over since ' 89. " // By the time the foursome reaches the 4th hole , the drizzle has turned to a steady downpour . Their clothes are soaked . Laugeni tugs at the black shirt he wore to slenderize himself as he shares with his fellow golfers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what makes a really good pizza ? " he says . " I 'll tell you what . The sauce . " He champions the sausage pie at Zuppardi 's in New Haven . " They make their own hot sausage on the premises and throw it on the pie in clumps , " he says . " Nothing beats a Zuppardi 's pie . " // Hardy demurs . " Have you ever had the white clam pizza at Pepe 's ? " he asks . " Clams , garlic and a layer of mozzarella . No tomato sauce . " // " Pepe 's ? " says Laugeni . " What about Sally 's ? I 'd settle for Sally 's bacon , mushroom and pepper pie . If I 'm in the mood for a little twist , I ask them to toss in a few dollops of ricotta. " // Hardy is now salivating like one of Pavlov 's pups . " I 'd take Pepe 's pizza over sex , " he says . " The wait outside is an hour and a half . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the snack shed behind the tee box for the par-3 9th hole . The rain falls in fat drops now as the players gaze out at this famous green , which keeps going and going and going for maybe 50 yards . Bisected by an eight-foot-wide swale , the green is about the size of one of the double greens on the Old Course at St. Andrews . In other words , it 's almost as big as Hardy 's appetite . " My game is totally screwed up now , " he says . " All I can think about is that pizza . " // The other three confess that they are having similar difficulties and agree that it 's time to pack it in and start packing it in . " After this hole , we 're done , " sputters the Radiator . " A true fat man would never work this hard . " // " Damn right , " roars Hardware . " Why stand in the rain golfing when there 's a clubhouse a thousand yards away with a TV and a free all-you-can-eat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his mouth and says , " You ready to get that pie at Pepe 's ? " // " Hell , no , " says Hardy . " Let 's head for the free buffet . Free is a major component of fat . " Hardy and Laugeni bang bellies again like mating water beds and veer off the course toward the vittles.
