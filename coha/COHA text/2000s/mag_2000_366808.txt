President Clinton 's trip last week to India and Pakistan felt more like a political campaign swing than a statesman 's visit . There were policy speeches and " issues events " on health and the environment . There were photo ops and town-hall meetings . Sometimes all that seemed to be missing was candidate rallies and attack ads . <P> Make no mistake  --  his tour of the subcontinent and the meeting planned for Sunday in Geneva with Syrian President Hafez Assad were all part of Bill Clinton 's last campaign . Call it a quest for a legacy ( a term Clinton has banished from the White House lexicon ) or , as he might prefer , a simple attempt to do the most he can in the 10 months he has left in office . Either way , Clinton is waging a peace campaign , trying to use his skills as mediator and empathizer to end some of the world 's most stubborn conflicts . In addition to those he confronted during this trip , there 's the tattered Northern Ireland power-sharing agreement to repair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ... <P> The goal of his talk with Assad was to move along Syria 's stalled peace talks with Israel . Syria wants to begin talking about where the new border should be , but Israel first wants security guarantees and normalized relations . The problem on the Asian subcontinent , which Clinton had been aching to tackle for years , is twofold : the need for Indians and Pakistanis to back away from a war that could quickly go nuclear , and to end the cold war-era estrangement between India and the U.S. A senior American official claims to have heard " the sound of ice melting " in Indo-American relations , but neither the Indians nor Pakistani coup leader General Pervez Musharraf , who got a stern Clinton lecture on democracy during their brief meeting in Islamabad , took any steps to reduce tension . <P> Staff and the press knew they were in for an unusual trip when , right after takeoff , the Secret Service handed out strict written warnings to be especially careful because Americans in the region had been the targets of terrorists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to a Bangladeshi village by helicopter over dense jungle  --  scheduled to spotlight microcredit loans  --  was abruptly scrubbed because of threats from terrorist groups linked to Osama bin Laden . The next day brought news reports of a horrific massacre of 35 Sikhs in the troubled Indian province of Kashmir , the key source of trouble with Pakistan . Security would interrupt the script again at week 's end , when the President slipped deftly into an unmarked plane for his trip from India to Islamabad while the designated Air Force One plane pulled in without him . <P> Throughout , Clinton remained unrattled , hitting his stride quickly with a speech to the Indian Parliament , where he turned on the famous Clintonian empathy ( statesman 's edition ) and displayed his politically perfect pitch , showing respect for India 's prickly assertiveness on the nuclear question . " Only India can determine its own interests , " he said to thunderous applause . The Indians , both legislators and press , were dazzled . ( " A masterly display of diplomatic oratory that floored his select audience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) The Americans , in turn , were startled when the lawmakers , an anti-American bunch by reputation , all but trampled one another afterward in the scramble to shake his hand .
