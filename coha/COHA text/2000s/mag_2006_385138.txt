THE day after Katrina , pictures of stranded and suffering New Orleanians at the Louisiana Superdome and Ernest N. Morial Convention Center hit the national and international news . Their faces , filled with so much pain and struggle , shocked both my wife and me . I was sad and angry because I knew there was no reason people should have been left at the Superdome or convention center , the landmark that bears my father 's name , without food , water and medical supplies . Something had gone very , very wrong . When I learned that breaks in the levees were the source of New Orleans ' flooding , my heart sank . I told my wife , Michelle , a former TV anchor/reporter in New Orleans , that even one levee collapse would be a great impending catastrophe . I had spent plenty of hurricane seasons viewing computer modeling to know that the city would fill with water like a bathtub beneath a faucet . Katrina had become the " worst case scenario . " What was most distressing was the weak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officials . The phones at our New York house rang constantly with calls from New Orleanians , who were either stranded or frantically searching for family members in their beloved hometown . As each day passed , the magnitude of what had become an international crisis squarely hit me . I called my childhood friend , Wynton Marsalis . We yearned to do something more than watch from the safety of New York City . We decided to act . So we spoke to the key leaders at Black Entertainment Television and within 72 hours organized a very successful telethon that raised $13 million for the American Red Cross . When I visited New Orleans a few weeks later , I arrived at a city that had few signs of life . I visited my old neighborhood , Pontchartrain Park , which I knew had been completely covered by water earlier . Now dry , it was gray and lonely . There were abandoned cars everywhere . It was the Daggs ' home that caught my attention . The door had been jarred open . When I peered inside , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time . The house was all topsy-turvy with furniture turned over and walls with black mold . Anyone stranded would have clearly had a hard time coming out alive . All of the houses in Pontchartrain Park had suffered such substantial damage that remediation , repair and rebuilding would be difficult and indeed expensive at best . But nothing could prepare me for the 9th Ward as I crossed the old , historic St. Claude Avenue Bridge-near the man-made industrial canal where the levee broke . The lower 9th Ward is special . Not only was it home to Fats Domino , it formed an important part of the strong base of support that not only helped my father , but me , through two mayoral elections . It is an area that had long been forgotten . One of my earliest commitments after being elected mayor was to hold the State of the City Address at the Martin Luther King Elementary Library , which had been built as a result of a collaboration between the city and state . After my address , we crossed the street to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the youth of the neighborhood . While others had thought of the lower 9th Ward as unimportant and forgotten , it was a special part of the city to me . Both my father and I were determined through our mayoral terms to build schools , libraries , gymnasiums and repave the streets . I tried to help the neighborhood play catch-up after years of neglect and abandonment . It was a strong neighborhood of great character with a powerful sense of community . These memories made the devastation even more personal , even more heartbreaking . We tried to find the levee break itself , and the closer we came , the more difficult the obstacle course before us . On Caffin Avenue , we looked to our left to see the Glapion Funeral Home 's signature long white limousine . It had been carried two blocks by the sheer force of the storm 's surge . The gap in the levee was several city blocks long . The path it cut was like a powerful bomb , shattering every structure in its wake . The pain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us who were part of that trip was numbing . Despite it all , many homes were still standing . I came away believing that all of these neighborhoods could make a comeback . If the will of the people was there and with proper planning , resources and a commitment by the federal government to build a first-class levee system , it could be possible . On our way back to downtown New Orleans , we encountered a man walking swiftly with what appeared to be a large book . He recognized me , and we embraced . He said that he had walked 55 blocks , defying the order to stay out of the lower 9th Ward area . He not only wanted to see his home , but he wanted to retrieve his large family Bible , which he was carrying under his arm . He said it was one of the few things in his home that was not completely destroyed . Seeing his home gave him closure , and retrieving his treasured family Bible gave him the power and strength to move on . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never imagined that the greatest urban crisis that any city would face-since perhaps the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906-would be faced by my beloved hometown , New Orleans . I never imagined that my neighbors would drown in their beds and in their attics . I never imagined that my friends would stand on their roofs as marooned as castaways on a deserted island . I never imagined that many of the places that made up my life are only left as memories . But it happened . The winds howled . The rains came . The levees did not hold . In fact , they breached . The water poured in . And it poured in , literally washing away my hometown and the hometowns of thousands of others throughout the Gulf Coast . From the time Katrina hit , local Urban Leagues along the Gulf Coast sprang into action , helping victims find housing , jobs , respect and dignity at a very troubled time . The American people and the Urban League had answered inaction with action . Inability with creativity , and indifference with compassion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ served as the basis for the Congressional Black Caucus ' Katrina Recovery Act that called upon the U.S. Congress to immediately enact a three-point plan to aid Katrina victims . It proposed : 1 ) creating a victims compensation fund patterned after the 9/11 fund authorized after the 9/11 terrorist attacks ; 2. ) providing meaningful disaster unemployment assistance for every worker left jobless by the tragedy that meets their and their families ' needs ; and 3 ) protecting the voting rights of the hundreds of thousands displaced . I was hopeful that as our nation faced the glaring inequities of poverty along the Gulf Coast , we would be ready to fight to narrow the widening economic abyss between the haves and have-nots that threatens the very fabric of our republic . Katrina was a national tragedy of epic , indeed biblical , proportions . But it also gave us a valuable opportunity-not just to build new buildings and stronger levees as we must , but to put the principles that we have aspired to for so many years into practice . Now , one year later , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping New Orleans reclaim its lost splendor and bring its people back . In the 19th century , a great fire devastated Chicago , claiming about 3,000 lives and leaving 90,000 homeless . The city is now one of the nation 's great centers of commerce , culture , multiculturalism and diversity . In the 20th century , a great earthquake ravaged San Francisco , killing more than 700 and causing more than $400 million in damage . That great city stands today as one of the world 's great cultural centers . And at the beginning of the 21st century , a terrorist attack in New York City left more than 3,000 people of all races , creeds , colors , ethnicities and religions dead , and it also felled two great towers that symbolized American strength and commerce . The Big Apple is now experiencing a strong economic rebound . But will New Orleans ever stand among these cities that have suffered great tragedy only to emerge from the ashes stronger than ever ? Katrina provides a defining moment in American history that generations to come will judge us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends and family and loved ones who died in attics , who drowned in their beds , who died not in peace but in suffering by forgetting about them , by losing sight of them or by someone saying , " Let 's just get beyond it . " How my hometown and the Gulf Coast emerge from the devastation left in Katrina 's wake could be the source of our nation 's greatest shame or greatest pride .
