Balloons and wearing red aside , the coming of the Holy Spirit is the point . // I HAVE A PROBLEM . AS A freelance writer , one of the things I do for a living is write religious books and materials for children . And in the guidelines for these materials , sacraments are defined as celebrations of the church . This is my problem : trying to persuade children that sacraments are celebrations . Because in the experience of many of these kids , they are n't . They experience sacraments that are solemn , over-their-heads , tedious , and sometimes flavored with warnings and menace . But celebrations they are n't . The kids know it , and I know it . This makes it hard to write flowery text that suggests otherwise . I have another problem . Having facilitated the Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults process for nine years in parishes and campus ministry , I often find myself in the position of trying to persuade adults that the Holy Spirit is a dynamic force in their lives . Because for many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a strange large bird that hovers over the church and never touches down in their neighborhood . And they know it , and I know it . And I ca n't kid anyone about that . I dream of a church with liberty and Pentecost for all . Pentecost has been a most misunderstood feast . It gets upstaged by Christmas , not only commercially , but even liturgically . The retailers ' dilemma around Pentecost makes sense ( What would you sell ? Candles and fans ? ) , but I lament the present inability of some parishes to come up with more than a rather lame " red Sunday . " Local bulletins remind the congregation : " Everybody wear red on Pentecost ! " And some people do , and wonder why . Why should getting flame-colored on Pentecost be anything more than a poor excuse for a sacramental ? Pentecost gets promoted as " the birthday of the church . " Yet if celebration in church is already suspect , all balloons aside , I am afraid the feast has yet to become convincing for many people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the coming of the Holy Spirit into the church and into our lives , making us stewards of the power of God , commissioned to operate in the world as agents of the kingdom . We can pray to God and tell the story of Jesus , but if we do n't have an active relationship with the Spirit , then religion is a dead language , a remembrance of things past . The Christian story is not about our glorious past but has vitality for the present and promise for eternity . Grace happens . And it happens because the Spirit lives in us . If your life is a happy instrument upon which the Spirit is already making beautiful music , I 'm not telling you anything new . And if it is n't , this may be trying to put the ocean into a bottle with a funnel . Of course , every catechist knows that the Spirit ca n't be taught , but caught . If you were forced to Photograph // memorize the seven gifts of the Spirit in order to be confirmed and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useless mere information can be . The Spirit comes to us in relationship , and our best efforts sometimes reduce that relationship to a formula . How does our relationship with the Spirit come about ? We 've got two stories in scripture to appeal to . The first story to be written is Luke 's account in Acts 2:1-11 . This is the story we associate with the event : closed upper room , disciples praying , profound event of wind and flame , tongues of fire , a burst of miraculous language . These people 's lives were changed , blown open by divine invitation . Pentecost is not the feast of linguistics , despite the phenomenon of tongues . It is the feast of understanding . A gang of disciples who had followed Jesus for years , heard everything he had to say , witnessed his miracles , knew his forgiveness , cringed at his Crucifixion and rejoiced at his Resurrection were still hanging around in the upper room , praying , 50 days after Easter : These folks had every benefit we might covet , yet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ascension in Acts 1:6-12 , Jesus gives them the Great Commission to witness to the ends of the earth , and then he is taken up . The angels tell the onlookers to stop looking into the clouds for more instructions : It 's over . Time to move on . But they do n't really move on . They go back to the place where they 've been staying since the Last Supper . Jesus did n't spend three years with these people without getting a clue as to how they operate , which is why he told them to stay in Jerusalem until the Spirit shows up . The Spirit opened a window for the disciples and let in light and air . The Spirit opened their minds , and they saw , for the first time , precisely what " witness to the ends of the earth " meant . So they stumbled into the street and proclaimed what they had seen and heard . People thought they were drunk . And yet we are told , 3,000 were baptized that day . Some homily ! If 3,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one city , imagine what could have happened next . Yet we wonder if many of them simply received Baptism in the heat of the moment , went home , and cooled off . As any churchgoer knows , there is a regretful distinction between our rituals and our realities . We make sure our children receive the sacraments , and yet some will abandon the life of the church as adults . Twenty adults may come through our RCIA sessions , make it to Easter-and then 10 show up in the pews thereafter , if we 're lucky . ON THE OTHER HAND , SOME OF OUR MOST PROFOUNDLY REligious experiences have nothing apparent to do with church . Falling in love and surrendering to the beloved . Walking through a cathedral glade of trees and seeing sunstreams filter through the canopy of green . Losing a loved one to death and then encountering their spirit , joyfully , in a coincidental event that only the two of you would appreciate . Religion and ritual are central to our lives as Catholics , and yet what is religious does n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new thing that can be laid at the door of the present generation , as we often like to do . Even the early church had these discrepancies . Consider the story in Acts 10:44-49 where the Holy Spirit is discovered active in a community before they are baptized . The apostles are a little unnerved by this and promptly play catch-up by baptizing the assembly and proceeding to catechize them . Or consider the story of Philip and the Ethiopian eunuch . When Philip shows up , the man is reading the prophecies of Isaiah and needs some help interpreting their meaning . After a short ride and conversation together , the eunuch is sold on Jesus . " Here is some water-what is to prevent me from being baptized ? " the man proposes ( Acts 8:26-40 ) . The RCIA director in me can think of a dozen reasons to shout , " Do n't do it , Philip ! " but none of them are as compelling as Philip 's positive response . I actually encountered a situation like this some years back , when serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seminary before the invention of RCIA ( or " before the restoration of the ancient rite , " as we catechists say ) . The pastor just plain did n't get it , thought the process was all hoopla . I spent patient months and great energy each year in preparing adults for Baptism according to the Rite . Meanwhile the pastor was meeting people at backyard picnics and baptizing them upon request . The hallowed process was being subverted ! I was ready to tear my hair out . But then he explained to me that the folks he occasionally met and baptized in their homes were n't looking for an RCIA process-and would never come near one . These people were having an experience of something so big , it was transforming their lives on the spot . He was n't offering them something that was n't already burgeoning within them . Was he going to turn his back on the clear presence of the Holy Spirit in this person 's life ? It was his job to ritually claim it . You may argue whether that represents an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unarguable is that the Holy Spirit is larger than our rituals . The Spirit is an untameable force in our lives . Spirit wo n't show up just because we say so , or stay away until we 're ready to receive it ritually . Although I 've seen a hundred lives transfigured through the RCIA , I ca n't deny that others have extraordinary experiences of grace that have no name and no process . THE WOMAN WHO CUTS MY HAIR IS A CASE IN POINT . UNchurched , innocent of creed and dogma , and a lesbian to boot , she does n't fit the religious stereotype of a candidate for grace . Yet from within the story of her life as I 've listened to it over the years , there is a movement mirroring the activity of the Holy Spirit . Once , after I admitted what I do for a living , her scissors paused above my head . Bending near my face , tears streaming down her cheeks , she whispered , " Does Jesus love me ? " " Without a doubt ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past by religion , or someone who claimed to be religious , but that has n't stopped the Spirit from working in her . Who am I to withhold from her the love of Christ ? Then there 's James the taximan . James has n't had a haircut since John Lennon was shot . He 's a leftover from the ' ' 60s , flaky , New-Agey , a tie-dye guy . When I need a ride in a cab , I call James . The reason I call James is because he 's one of the few cab drivers in my town who was willing to pick up my friend in his wheelchair during the final months of his life . Picking up a wheelchair passenger means time , effort , energetic transfers from the chair to the car , and it 's not cost-effestive for ambitious drivers to bother . But James came for us , night and day , whenever we paged him . He 'd drop everything to get us , even in the pouring rain . This guy would n't know Jesus from Jack , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets it . It seems to me that Jesus would round up folks like these in a New York minute . The Holy Spirit circles the globe , finds people whose hearts are open and whose lives are ready , and takes up residence there . The dead giveaway is the spirit of understanding that envelopes the person in whom the Spirit is alive . Which brings us to the second recounting of Pentecost in scripture , the quiet little version in John 's Gospel . Writing a decade or so after Luke , John gives us an immediate-impact Pentecost . Jesus appears to his disciples on the night of Easter-not 50 days later . He offers them peace , shows them evidence of his identity , and then simply breathes on them : " Receive the Spirit " ( John 20:19-23 ) . No roaring wind , just a gentle breath . No pyrotechnics , just a relationship they trust . This too is Pentecost : the Spirit imparted in a quiet hour , to disciples who remain surprisingly speechless . They do not rush out into the streets at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maybe they savor it awhile , plant it down deeper for a later harvest . Perhaps then we should n't hang our heads if our experience and expression of the Holy Spirit acting in our lives is rather more humble . Maybe red is n't exactly our color . But style was never the issue here , whether flashy or subdued . The point is to get Pentecost , be ready for it , anticipate it , pray for it . It 's ours , given to us by Christ , necessary to our lives as people of faith . Maybe you 'll speak in tongues , receive seven discreet gifts , and your life will change in a heartbeat . Or maybe you 'll just get it , what all this God-talk is about , and steer your life around accordingly . There 's certainly enough Pentecost for everyone .
