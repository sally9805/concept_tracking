Pir Mahmad , an officer in the Afghan national police , was on his way to Sangin , in southwestern Afghanistan , last month when he found himself fighting for his life . He was traveling in a police convoy of five dilapidated pickup trucks armed with a modest arsenal of rocket launchers and AK-47s . As the patrol neared Sangin , Mahmad , 22 , heard gunshots . He looked up to see that the man riding next to him was dead . Soon they were surrounded by Taliban guerrillas who had charged from the hilltops shouting " Allahu akbar . " Five policemen were killed before commanders called in air support and backup from Afghan army soldiers and U.S. commandos . Later that day , at a triage center in nearby Gereshk , Mahmad pulls up a sleeve to show where a bullet grazed his arm . In four years ' policing one of the country 's most volatile regions , he says , " I have never seen fighting like this . " <P> This is a side of Afghanistan that George W. Bush did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first time , Bush spent five hours in the capital , Kabul , and hailed Afghanistan 's progress since the ouster of the Taliban more than four years ago . The country has made strides : it has an elected government , newly paved roads , more children in school , the appearance of a few shopping centers in Kabul . But the improvements in the lives of many Afghans are tempered by the country 's persistent insecurity , which is fueled by a rampant drug trade and a Taliban-led insurgency growing more brazen , sophisticated and lethal . More than 1,600 Afghans and 99 U.S. soldiers were killed in combat last year , the bloodiest period since the fall of the Taliban . Since the beginning of 2006 , eight more Americans have died , including one last week . Few believe the fighting is likely to subside . Lieut . General Michael Maples , who heads the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency , told Congress last week that " insurgents now represent a greater threat to the expansion of Afghan government authority than at any point since late 2001 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U.S. military is hoping to draw down its 19,000-member force in Afghanistan and turn over responsibility for much of the troubled south to NATO forces . Washington also hopes the newly trained Afghan army , which has 35,000 troops , will assume a greater role . But in places like Helmand province , where few Afghan or foreign troops were stationed , the main burden of fending off the insurgents has fallen to an Afghan police force that is poorly trained and often overmatched by the Taliban . Says Sam Zia-Zarifi , research director of Human Rights Watch 's Asia Division : " They are totally ill prepared for what they are going to face . " <P> When TIME visited one police unit in Helmand last month , the shortcomings were obvious . A number of policemen said they had n't been paid in a year . Most did not have uniforms . Some had received a few weeks of training , others none at all . Though Taliban militants in the area have murdered aid workers and local politicians , torched schools and menaced teachers , the police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essentially ceding territory to the insurgents . Haji Mosa Jan , the Gereshk district commander , says , " We used to patrol with one or two men " in Sangin , but now it 's too dangerous to patrol at all . " We thought the coalition forces were here to fight terrorists , " says one of Jan 's deputies , " but it seems like we get very little support . "
