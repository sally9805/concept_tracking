<p> Los Alamos National Lab employees are anxiously awaiting the climax of a four-year saga : a decision that will determine who runs the world 's most glamorous and controversial nuclear weapons lab and that also could end the University of California 's unchallenged six-decade domination of the U.S. weapons program . <p> An announcement could come soon , perhaps even Friday . <p> The decision will wrap up a six-month competition to run scandal-shaken Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico , where the first atomic bomb was tested in 1945 . UC and its industrial partners , including San Francisco-based Bechtel National Inc. , are competing for the contract against aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp . and its allies  --  the huge University of Texas system , several New Mexico universities and various industrial partners . <p> Whoever gets the contract will be in charge of the lab for the next seven years  --  and possibly 13 years if the new management is deemed good enough to earn a six-year extension offered in the contract . A Lockheed Martin takeover would be seen as an example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation 's nuclear weapons complex . <p> Loss of the contract by UC would be a crushing blow to the university system 's reputation and , perhaps , to the state of California , which owes much of its international economic clout and attractiveness to investors ' perception of the state as the Nobel laureate-packed front line of scientific and technological advances . <p> Lab officials have always insisted they run Los Alamos as a matter of public service , not for the money  --  and understandably so , because until recently , it was no way for a giant university system to get rich . Each year , the Department of Energy typically gave UC about $9 million in annual reimbursements for its Los Alamos work , which was peanuts considering the lab 's size , prestige and overall budget . ( In January , DOE punished UC for bungled work at Los Alamos by cutting its 2005 award to $3 million . ) <p> In the next contract , though , the maximum potential annual reimbursement is immensely higher , $79 million , depending on the contractor 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quasi-independent agency under the U.S. Energy Department , was scheduled to announce the winner around Dec. 1 . This week , however , rumors of an early decision swept the Los Alamos lab , where thousands of staff members await word of their fate . Staffers have spread word that an announcement could come as early as Friday , and a Los Alamos official refused Tuesday to rule out the possibility . <p> " There 's a lot of tension , just waiting for a decision , " said Los Alamos safety specialist John Jennings , who helped FBI investigators expose financial corruption at the lab in 2002-03 . <p> UC has run the lab since 1943 without having to compete for its Energy Department contracts . But in 2003 , Los Alamos and its management by UC came under fire after a series of security , safety , financial and managerial scandals at the lab , and the Energy Department and Congress ordered that all future contracts be open to outside bidders . <p> Several lab staff members told The Chronicle this week that they thought the Lockheed-Texas team had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view as a ghastly parade of UC screw-ups . <p> " The morale here is abysmal , " said theoretical physicist Brad Lee Holian . " People 's lives have been wrenched apart by the political games that have been played . You ca n't hold people 's careers by the heels out over the balcony without them feeling threatened and cheapened . " <p> A 20-year employee , Collin Sadler , a project leader in the lab 's detonator surveillance division , said he favored UC partly because he believed it offered a more attractive retirement system . But he expects Lockheed to win , and " most ( staffers ) appear to be resigned to the fate of the gods . " <p> In recent months , the Lockheed-Texas team has benefited from continued leaks of bad news from Los Alamos . <p> The latest case involved an " Occurrence Report , " which came to light late last month concerning an incident in October 2003 in which a lab official with a reputation for verbal bullying ordered two staffers to return to a laboratory they had fled after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning sensation . " The report , dated June 30 , 2005 , said both workers had complied and , as a result , were exposed to fumes of hydrochloric acid . One worker has since suffered " decreased lung function " and " has been reassigned to other work . " <p> Lab investigator Joseph Richardson , who wrote the report , said the incident underscored " what appears to be a work environment of mistreatment and reprisal " at the lab . This atmosphere caused the two workers to fear they would lose their jobs if they angered their supervisor , who " had a history of making disparaging and inappropriate remarks ... and engaged in preferential treatment when making work assignments , " Richardson said . <p> In 2002-03 , the Los Alamos scandals reached a climax when top management officials , including the lab 's director and chief auditor , were forced to resign . Other aspects of the scandals took longer to resolve  --  for example , in February , a district court judge in Albuquerque sentenced former lab employee Peter Bussolini to six months in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lab account to buy more than $300,000 worth of hunting and outdoor gear , TV sets and other products . Another employee , Scott Alexander , was sentenced to a year and a day in prison on similar charges . <p> Over the months , lab officials have repeatedly insisted that they have cleaned up their act and that they are ready to handle Los Alamos more maturely than in the past . <p> " Our historic relationship with Los Alamos embodies the university 's highest mission of public service , and we believe our decision to compete vigorously for the new contract represents the best interests of the nation , " UC Board of Regents Chairman Gerald Parsky said in a statement in May after the regents voted 11-1 to compete for the contract . <p> Being in that position has been humiliating for UC . It 's especially embarrassing because UC 's leaders insisted in 2003 that they would n't stoop to compete with anyone . <p> " We will not compete for the contract , because it is a public service ; it is something we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darling said in January 2003 . <p> The subsequent 2 1/2 years have been a comic opera of stumbles , finger-pointing and lurid incidents . <p> Computer disks of classified data allegedly were lost , leading to frantic searches that ended when lab officials concluded the disks had never existed in the first place . The lab director denounced sloppy employees as " cowboys " and " buttheads , " shut down the lab for months so everyone could take retraining classes and forced out five employees while disciplining seven others . <p> A lab auditor who was scheduled to testify to Congress about lab misdeeds claimed he had been beaten up in the parking lot of a topless bar by people who told him to keep his mouth shut ; police concluded that the incident was just an ugly bar fight unrelated to lab issues . <p> " I think people are probably ready for a change , " observed Jennings , 56 , a 30-year veteran of the lab who hopes Lockheed wins the competition . <p> He grieves that UC 's long and often brilliant scientific legacy  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry-quoting J. Robert Oppenheimer , who oversaw " a small ( scientific ) community based on a lot of trust and mutual respect "  --  has sunk so low . <p> " It 's sad to see it end that way , " he said . <p> What 's at stake <p> Two consortiums are fighting for the right to run Los Alamos National Laboratory . <p> Who 's competing <p> In one corner : the University of California and its partners , including Bechtel National . In the other is Lockheed Martin , which is teaming with the University of Texas , several New Mexico universities and their industrial partners . <p> History <p> UC has run the lab since 1943 , but a series of scandals prompted the Department of Energy to put oversight of the lab up for bid .
