<p> You know it 's a hot market for technology journalists when the Wall Street Journal ca n't keep people . <p> The Journal  --  the nation 's most prestigious business publication  --  has lost a spate of talent lately , including a rash of defections from its San Francisco bureau . <p> Among the movers : Pulitzer Prize-winner George Anders , a 22-year veteran , headed to Fast Company as a senior editor setting up its West Coast bureau ; Dean Takahashi , who covers computer games and chips , is off to Red Herring ; and biotech writer Ralph King " got the 10-year itch " and is joining former bureau chief Greg Hill at the new Time Inc. magazine eCompany Now . Also missing from the bureau is David Bank , who is on leave writing a book . <p> The departed join Quentin Hardy , who left the bureau last year for Forbes , and a number of other more recent ( and nontech beat ) defectors from New York and other bureaus . <p> Those leaving the San Francisco office are not merely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever seen , in which magazines are throwing around almost unmatchable salary offers . They also cite a desire to spend more time writing fewer stories , rather than cranking out small items that fit the Journal 's paper-of-record approach . <p> " I 'll go from writing 150 stories a year to a half-dozen or 10 , " Takahashi said . " I 'm hoping the quality of my stories goes up . " <p> Anders says he wo n't have to write " 4- to 5-inch stories on eBay outages and Network Associates earnings . " <p> Anders is also seizing an opportunity to write long stories , as well as shape the publication by joining its management team . He also respects Fast Company founders Bill Taylor and Alan Webber , and the way they 've grown the magazine to more than 500,000 in circulation . <p> King was lured not only by the prospects of covering the e-commerce revolution central to Silicon Valley , but also to reunite with his old boss , Hill , and to launch a new magazine on a " clean slate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any disaffection for the Journal itself , which has had its share of rocky employee relations in recent years over issues such as pensions and profit sharing . They had mostly good things to say about the Journal , a paper known generally for treating its employees well and encouraging high-quality writing . <p> " This is where I had always dreamed of working , " King said . " ECompany Now was a bolt out of the blue . " <p> San Francisco bureau chief Steve Yoder says the current turnover is no worse than its been in the past . Not counting Hill  --  who reported directly to New York , rather than to Yoder  --  he says four of the bureau 's 20 staffers have left in the past year . " We 've been increasing our staff by leaps and bounds , so the probability of people leaving goes up , " he said . <p> Yoder has already hired Mylene Mangalindan from Bloomberg News to take over Internet reportage once handled by Kara Swisher , who is now writing a weekly column . He 's also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cover Microsoft and Pui-Wing Tam to cover Apple , Palm and wireless applications . He also snagged Lisa Bransten from the Journal 's Interactive Edition , and has " other people in the pipeline I ca n't tell you about . " <p> The moves represent a big switch from the old days  --  as recently as a year or two ago  --  when it was so prestigious to write for the Journal 's 1.8 million readers that reporters would forgo other opportunities . <p> Now , all the big business publications , including Forbes , Fortune and Business Week , have to work to keep their talent from jumping to upstarts like Red Herring and the Industry Standard . <p> The upstarts are not making it easy , because hiring away writers from the major-league publications gives them a big credibility boost . In going to Red Herring , Takahashi will receive a signing bonus , stock options and a pay raise , and will be able to work out of his garage in San Jose . <p> Hardy said Journalists seem to be following the advice they read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I saw a billboard that said , The Wall " I Work for a Company Called Me " Street Journal , ' and I thought , Maybe they 're right , ' " Hardy said . " They were writing about a workplace where everyone is looking out for their own career , and it 's happening at a time where there 's an unusually strong sellers ' market for journalists . " <p> EURO-WIRED ? Keep an eye on what becomes of San Francisco 's Wired Digital in the wake of this week 's announcement that Web portal Lycos will be acquired by Spain 's Telefonica . Lycos , you 'll recall , owns Wired Digital  --  Web properties that include Wired News , Hotbot , WebMonkey and Suck  --  but not Wired magazine . <p> Wired News has been seeking expansion permission from the Lycostians for many months , and now may have a chance to take its franchise overseas . Editor George Shirk headed to Massachusetts yesterday to scope out the deal . <p> E 'S COMPANY : It 's too soon to judge the journalistic content of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but they sure throw a great party . A thousand people turned out at Pac Bell Park last Thursday night , mingling on the field and dancing to the pop band Barenaked Ladies . <p> Was it ominous , though , that the first song from the Barenaked Ladies was their hit , " It 's all been done " ? That , after all , will be eCompany 's challenge  --  selling a new-economy magazine in a crowded marketplace . <p> ECompany President and Editor Ned Desmond said his plan is to give the magazine more of a mass-market appeal than his inside-baseball rivals . <p> " The hard question for me is , is the general business readership in America ready for eCompany now ? " Desmond said . " That 's the question that keeps me up at night . " <p> The first issue is quite reminiscent of eCompany 's parent , Fortune . Fortune staffer Joe Nocera contributes a profile of Schwab CEO David Pottruck ; Fortune columnists David Kirkpatrick and Stewart Alsop also make appearances . <p> But as eCompany aims at Fortune readers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testy with Fortune " already , Desmond said . " They do n't see our story list and we do n't see theirs . The wall will get thicker and higher each month because we 'll be competing with those guys . " <p> To date , the greatest criticism of eCompany has been its name  --  especially the precious " now " tacked on at the end . Desmond is sanguine , almost cryptic , in defending the name , and the " now . " " Great magazines transcend their name , whatever their name happens to be , " he said . <p> And the " now " ? " It is what it is , " is all he 'd say . <p> JERRY 'S NOT KIDDING : Time Warner CEO Gerald Levin came to San Francisco to kick off the eCompany party . In a brief preparty interview in the umpires ' dressing room at the ballpark , Levin defended both his company 's pending merger with America Online and its recent dispute with Disney . <p> The two subjects are not unrelated , as Disney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in blacking out Disney-owned ABC from its cable customers for a couple of days this month  --  is reason to block its merger with AOL . With no apparent irony , Disney  --  a huge media company  --  fears the even huger media company in the offing , AOL Time Warner . <p> Have no fear , Levin said , looking like a grandfatherly sort in a corduroy jacket . AOL Time Warner will do business with everyone : It will sell its content to other distributors , and it will distribute other companies ' content . <p> The dispute with Disney was only over " a relatively obscure provision in the law . " <p> Disney and others need not fear AOL Time Warner 's online omnipotence , he said . " In this day , the notion that anyone can exercise any control over the Internet is belied by reality , " he said . <p> So big media wo n't be bad ? " This is a company that cares about society , " Levin said . <p> I feel much better now . <p> FISHING IN THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silicon Valley 's mergers are motivated by companies ' needs to acquire engineering talent . What about media mergers ? <p> Red Herring Communications this week bought StockMaster.com , and one of the prime motivations was to acquire its engineers , according to Herring CEO Chris Alden . " Publishing on the Internet is basically . . . print put online , but it 's not going to be in the future , " Alden said . " We have to build portfolio-tracking , customization , personalization . In order to do it as a media company , you have to be an engineering company . " <p> More than half of StockMaster 's 60 employees are engineers , Alden said , and they 'll remain in their Cupertino offices . <p> The acquisition also gives Red Herring the ability to put portfolio management and other types of financial information on its site , putting it more directly into competition with sites like MarketWatch.com and TheStreet.com . <p> Alden would n't put a dollar figure on the deal , saying it was a stock swap between private companies . <p> NO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community when former Chronicle staffer Steve Ringman won the $1 million grand prize in a PhotoPoint.com contest . Bill Haines , assistant photo editor of the Fresno Bee , e-mailed an online discussion group of news photographers , " It seems that a bunch of the judges for this contest either had worked with or in the same community as Ringman and would have been very familiar with the picture . " <p> Sure enough , judges included former San Francisco Examiner photographers Kim Komenich and John Storey , and other current and former Bay Area photographers . But five of the 10 people judging the contest disqualified themselves from scoring Ringman 's photo because of that familiarity , according to PhotoPoint community director Dave Dornlas . <p> Ringman 's 1983 photo of schoolgirls getting buffeted by the wind was so highly rated by the remaining five judges that it took the top prize . ( The Chronicle , which retained rights to the photo , is letting Ringman keep 90 percent of the prize money and will donate its own share to charity . ) <p> Ringman was relieved that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said he has done when he 's judged other contests . " It 's kind of a small world , the whole photography crowd , " he said . <p> Haines , too , was pleased that PhotoPoint had kept the contest on a firm ethical plane . <p> LOGROLLING : I 'm sure we all got warm and fuzzy feelings seeing Kevin O'Brien , general manager of Channel 2 KTVU , say a few words in support of beleaguered Examiner Publisher Tim White in an on-air editorial . But should n't O'Brien have disclosed his personal and professional relationship with White and the Ex ? <p> The Examiner and the local Fox affiliate have a promotional agreement , O'Brien said in an interview . And although O'Brien initially said " darn right , I am " a friend of White 's , he later qualified that statement , noting , " I 've never been to his home . He 's never been to my home . We 've never had dinner together . I 've met him two times socially and two times professionally . That 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Which is to say : O'Brien believes his personal feelings and professional dealings with White and the Examiner had nothing to do with his editorial , and needed no disclosure . <p> Media Bytes appears every Thursday in The Chronicle .
