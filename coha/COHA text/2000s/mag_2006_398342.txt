Section : PROFILE Growing up in a gritty urban neighborhood , Erich Jarvis dreamed of becoming a ballet star . Now the scientist 's studies of how birds learn to sing are forging a new understanding of the human brain <p> IF YOU WERE LOOKING for an animal in which to study the evolution of language , the zebra finch  --  a native of Australia that weighs about an ounce and has a brain the size of a grape  --  might not seem an obvious choice . Until recently ; in fact , few researchers even considered the possibility that birds , with an evolutionary history that diverged from that of mammals 300 million years ago , have much to teach us about intelligence . But , says Duke University 's Erich Jarvis , zebra finches have one truly outstanding quality  --  " vocal learning , " the ability to remember and reproduce the sounds they hear , an ability shared , as far as we know , by only a handful of animal families . Besides human beings , these are elephants , bats , whales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and songbirds . <p> Pigeons coo and chickens squawk ; wolves howl and monkeys chatter . But those sounds are innate . Dogs and horses can learn to respond to vocal commands , and some apes can be taught a primitive sign language . But none of those animals can learn to imitate new sounds , which appears to be one of the skills that made human culture possible . So in a basement a few flights down from Jarvis ' laboratory , several hundred orange-beaked , gray-backed zebra finches fill the room with a soft chirruping , like so many tiny , squeaking fan belts . Their fate is to have their brains analyzed for the presence of proteins that signify the activation of certain genes during singing . " What 's the most complex thing a brain can do ? Language , " says Jarvis , a 41-year-old neurobiologist . " I am starting from the naive position that if you can decipher the most complex thing about how the brain works , everything else will fall into place . " <p> Oddly ; perhaps , Jarvis began his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most disorganized and chaotic member of my laboratory . " That was in 1989 , when Jarvis , a product of the New York City public schools and Hunter College , arrived at Rockefeller University to study under Nottebohm , renowned for discovering that songbird brains actually grow new nerve cells throughout the bird 's life . Jarvis is tall , lean and loose-limbed , with a short , curly beard ; a former dancer who considered a career in ballet , he walks quickly and speaks rapidly in a soft , even voice . Growing up , he lived with his mother in Harlem after his parents ' divorce , and with grandparents in Brooklyn and the Bronx . He attended the High School of the Performing Arts , and a bird , in his early experience , was something you cooked for Sunday dinner . In 1998 , having completed his doctorate at Rockefeller , Jarvis moved to Duke , where four years later he received the Alan T. Waterman Award , the highest honor given by the National Science Foundation to a young researcher . <p> One great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it , because he can plausibly claim to be doing work that might lead to a cure for human disease . Tracing the pathways of vocal learning in birds might help researchers working to restore speech in stroke victims , Jarvis says , adding : " We now know the avian brain is a lot more like the mammalian brain than people realized . " The possibility of new treatments for brain injuries led to a $2.5 million " Pioneer " grant to Jarvis from the National Institutes of Health . The award , for high-risk , groundbreaking research , makes him an object of envy to other researchers , including even his old mentor Nottebohm , who wryly notes that Jarvis " is getting these days much more grant support than I get . " <p> Jarvis is well known in the field for his speculation about the evolution of vocal learning  --  or , rather , its failure to evolve more often in nature . In songbirds , where as a rule the males sing , the trait plays a role in mating . " The more variable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choose you , " Jarvis says . " They call them sexy songs . " ( It is , he adds , not all that different in another vocal-learning species , the one that produces poetry and improvisational jazz . ) Jarvis believes that the neural architecture for vocal learning is basic to the vertebrate brain  --  specifically ; that it is related to the motor-learning system that enables an animal , say , to walk . In that case , Jarvis wondered , why has such a useful trait not evolved more often ? <p> His proposed answer ( along with that of Japanese researcher Kazuo Okanoya , who came up with the same idea independently ) represents a conceptual leap that his colleagues regard as somewhere between audacious and preposterous . He suggests that getting listened to is , for many animals , just another way to get eaten . Predators that become accustomed to the routine sounds of their prey take notice when someone whistles a different tune . Thus , evolution  --  which favors vocal learning by way of sexual selection  --  also works against it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the species capable of vocal learning can also fly ? Jarvis thinks not . When he talks about the idea at scientific meetings , he says , " half the room will be denouncing it . which does n't bother me . At least until someone comes along to disprove it . " <p> As a scientist , Jarvis has come a long way since his first years at Rockefeller , when he was also dancing with a small company called Ballet Afrique and nearly washed out of the lab . " I really did n't see that he was going to survive , " recalls David Clayton , a Rockefeller colleague now at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign . " It 's interesting now to see him flourish . He 's a very strong personality . " Nottebohm says , " Erich was very insecure . He told me he thought he was being ' dissed . ' I did n't even know what the word meant . I told him , you 're right , they 're discriminating against you , because you 're a lousy scientist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only the most hard-working member of the lab , but he started doing things that were creative and well thought through . " <p> It 's not unusual for the name of a scientist at a major university like Duke to show up in the New York Times , as Jarvis ' has half a dozen times . Yet the first Times reference to him is a 1983 review of his high-school graduation performance . ( " Lisa Arrington and Erich Jarvis had the audience cheering with their Soviet-style lifts in a War and Discord pas de deux , " the reviewer wrote . ) Six years later , while in his first year at Rockefeller , he turns up again , in a long article under the headline " Random Death Claims a Man Who Struggled to Regain Life . " The man was Jarvis ' father , James , who had been homeless for years , living in caves in New York City parks . James Jarvis had graduated from the High School of Music and Art at 15 and majored in chemistry at City College . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his later life , but in the year or so before his murder  --  an apparently motiveless crime that has not been solved  --  he had made efforts to reenter society . Erich Jarvis had been close to his father , when he could find him . " I do n't know how many homeless people out there are scientists , " he told the reporter . " But my father was a scientist . He was an explorer . He was studying survival techniques . He wanted to find the universal law of all laws . " <p> Jarvis has some theories about how cultural biases have entered into his own , highly abstract field of science . For example , he suspects that the role of " housekeeping " genes , which perform routine functions such as regulating metabolism or maintaining the integrity of the cell wall , have been overlooked by many scientists because " housekeeping " is regarded as uninteresting : " Who invented this term ? Why are those genes uninteresting ? Because in the past , I believe the male researchers were thinking about their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most African-American families  --  housekeeping is highly respected . " Recently his lab discovered that actin , a protein produced by one of the so-called " housekeeping " genes , appears to play a role in vocal learning . <p> When he 's not traveling , Jarvis is in the laboratory six or seven days a week . He long ago gave up performing , although he manages to go out dancing once in a while with his wife , Miriam Rivas , a molecular biologist whom he met at Hunter College and is now a member of his lab . ( One of her conditions for marrying Jarvis was that he know how to Latin dance . One of their concerns in moving to Durham , North Carolina , was whether they could find a suitable salsa club . They did . ) He thinks it 's not entirely a coincidence that someone whose life was steeped in music ended up studying bird song . ( His colleague at Duke , neurobiologist Richard Mooney who also works with songbirds , is a classical guitarist . ) Jarvis ' most recent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that controls the brain 's " reward " circuitry ; in the bird brain during song . " We do n't have the data to prove this , " Jarvis says , " but the implication is that the bird gets pleasure out of singing . " So much of life , for human and finch alike , comes down to music  --  and that singular gift of listening and learning . <p> <p> Where does language come from ? To find out , Jarvis ( with avian subjects at Duke ) and his co-workers study how particular genes control song-learning in zebra finches . The human brain , he suggests , is " more like the avian brain than people realized . " <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : What do dancing and scientific research have in common ?
