<p> After two years of heated public debate , Georgia 's highest court will decide whether a law requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls is constitutional . <p> The Georgia Supreme Court heard oral arguments Monday about the state 's 2006 law mandating voters to show one of six forms of government-issued photo ID at the polls . <p> The issue has pitted Republicans against Democrats , black lawmakers against their white colleagues , and liberal advocates for the poor and disabled against conservatives who championed the sanctity of the ballot box . It has also created a new battleground for former campaign rivals Gov . Sonny Perdue and former Gov . Roy Barnes . <p> Barnes , a Democrat , filed the lawsuit against Perdue , the Republican who beat him , and the state on behalf of Rosalind Lake , a disabled Atlanta woman who does not have a state-issued photo ID . In a booming voice , Barnes told the court Monday that the law violates the state constitution because it imposes an unnecessary condition on the act of voting in person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marching toward universal suffrage , " Barnes said . " The question is whether this court will take the first step backwards . " <p> Barnes walked the justices through Georgia 's checkered history on voting requirements , such as mandating that voters own 40 acres of land , have property worth at least $500 , pay a yearly poll tax or pass a literacy test unless the voter was a descendant of a Confederate veteran . <p> Most of those requirements were enacted to prevent blacks from voting , Barnes said . <p> Many black lawmakers used similar arguments in 2005 and 2006 when the General Assembly debated the voter ID legislation . <p> In 2005 , angry black lawmakers walked out of the House and Senate , setting off months of tension under the Gold Dome . <p> The Republican majority in the Legislature pushed through a revised version of the voter ID measure in early 2006 after a federal judge found the 2005 law imposed an unconstitutional poll tax and unduly burdens the right to vote . <p> Supporters of voter ID laws have been equally passionate about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mark Cohen , an attorney with Atlanta 's Troutman Sanders , served as a special assistant to Attorney General Thurbert Baker and argued the case Monday on behalf of Perdue and the State Election Board . <p> Cohen argued that the law does not impose an unconstitutional condition on voting and that it serves only to establish the identity of a person who goes to the polls to cast a ballot . <p> He also argued that the General Assembly has the authority to enact laws that set ID requirements for voters at the polls . <p> " There is nothing in the 2006 Photo ID Act that deprives one person of the right to vote in Georgia , " Cohen said . " Any registered voter in Georgia has these options . " <p> Before passage of the voter ID laws , Georgians could show any one of 17 forms of identification at the polls , including bank statements and utility bills . The state limited absentee voting to specific circumstances . <p> The new law in question requires registered voters who go to a polling place to show @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it allows registered voters to use an absentee ballot for any reason  --  and does not require any ID . <p> The Supreme Court gave no indication of when it would issue a decision . <p> The court is made up of seven nonpartisan members , five of whom were appointed by former Gov . Zell Miller , one by Joe Frank Harris and one by Perdue . Georgia Court of Appeals Judge Debra Bernes sat in for Justice Carol Hunstein . The court did not explain the switch . <p> The justices were relatively quiet during the arguments , although Justice Robert Benham asked Cohen several questions that referenced Georgia 's history of restricting certain voters from the polls . <p> " We went through a period in this state where for may years , sometimes because of race , the right to vote was frustrated , " Benham said . " Does this move us toward making the right to vote easier or does it move to frustrating the right to vote ? " <p> Cohen said the law makes it easier for Georgians to vote using absentee ballots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Benham also asked whether the state had any evidence that people go to the polls to vote using a false identity . <p> Former Secretary of State Cathy Cox , a Democrat , told the General Assembly in 2005 that during her two terms in office , she knew of no documented case of voter fraud involving a person pretending to be someone else at the polls . <p> Cohen did not answer the question directly , instead saying the case before the court was brought on purely constitutional grounds . <p> Justice George Carley asked Barnes whether he thought the voter ID law would protect him from having someone steal his identity to vote . Barnes replied that it would not . <p> He said later that the state can prosecute anyone who commits voter fraud by using a false identity . <p> THE STORY SO FAR <p> * April 2005  --  Gov . Sonny Perdue signs into law House Bill 244 , which would require Georgia voters to show one of six forms of government-issued ID costing up to $35 . <p> * September 2005  --  Advocacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law creates an unlawful obstacle to voting . <p> * October 2005  --  U.S. District Judge Harold Murphy grants a temporary injunction against the 2005 voter ID law , saying it burdens the right to vote . <p> * January 2006  --  Perdue signs into law Senate Bill 84 , a revision of the law . This version requires the voter ID cards be issued for free , which lawmakers believe will satisfy the courts ' concerns . <p> * September 2006  --  Superior Court Judge T. Jackson Bedford Jr . decides the law is an unconstitutional " prerequisite " to voting . The state appeals to the state Supreme Court . Photo : CHARLOTTE B. TEAGLE / StaffFormer Gov .
