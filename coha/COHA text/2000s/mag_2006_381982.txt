Novelist , essayist , polemicist , all-purpose gadfly and now lion in winter , Gore Vidal has just published a second volume of memoirs , Point to Point Navigation , in which he thinks back on his life in letters and politics . Vidal , 81 , talked with TIME 's Richard Lacayo about the marginalization of the novel , his love life , Johnny Carson , J.F.K. 's assassination and the last word in last words . <P> In your memoir you say that you 're not a famous novelist  --  that no novelist is famous because novels are not discussed in public anymore . Has it got that bad ? <P> There 's no such thing anymore as a famous novelist . You can be a famous actor , a famous baseball player , a famous or an infamous politician . My point is not about me . My point is about the novel . <P> Writers were once a regular feature of late-night TV . Your memoir has an admiring chapter on Johnny Carson , whose show you appeared on frequently . What made Carson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rather frustrated by the restrictions that had been placed on him by the network . So if he found somebody sympathetic politically , as he found me , you ended up helping him express what he meant  --  but which he could not say  --  because of NBC 's **42;20053;TOOLONG policy . <P> You 've been called the last small-r republican  --  the last defender of an old ideal of the American republic . Has the U.S. evolved into an empire ? <P> We 've been one since the Louisiana Purchase in 1803 . In Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace a short book from 2002 , I stunned everybody by listing all of our military interventions in the past 200 years that were undertaken without declarations of war or even causes of war , starting in 1846 and the war against Mexico , which is the first moment the idea of empire took center stage in American affairs . As President James Polk said , " We 've just got to have California ! " Well , we got California  --  which the Mexicans are now quietly redeeming . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Senator T.P. Gore , who was blind . What do you think you inherited from him ? <P> What he said to me a thousand times as I was growing up and reading to him all the time : " The foundation of the United States is due process of law . " I hear that thundering in my head every day of my life . And then when I see due process of law being thrown out the window ... <P> Now that the Democrats have regained Congress , what would you like to see happen first ? <P> Call Dick Cheney for questioning about his role in why we are fighting in a place we do n't belong in . I think that would seriously discipline  --  to indulge in powerful language here  --  the other warmongers and profiteers . Just grill him under oath . <P> You write about the death three years ago of your partner Howard Auster . You say that after a time , you never were intimate but shared everything else . Is that a formula for happiness you recommend ? <P> Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make recommendations for anybody . <P> What do you think of gay marriage ? <P> Since heterosexual marriage is such a disaster , why on earth would anybody want to imitate it ? <P> Not long ago you packed up your home in Ravello , Italy . Why did you decide to settle in Los Angeles ?
