" Aw , c'm on , Cherise . Be reasonable . " Jack McPhee 's lips pulled back in a grimace . The heel of the hand not holding the telephone receiver clunked his temple . Too little , as recriminations went , and definitely a couple of words too late . <p> " Be reasonable " was number nineteen on the list of sixty-two things to never say to a woman . Any woman , whether you were dating her , sleeping with her , married to her , called her Mom or she knew " the usual " was Chivas on the rocks with a twist . <p> Therefore , it was hardly a surprise when Cherise Taylor 's normally dulcet drawl could have etched granite . " So , " she said , " it 's un reasonable for me to be upset about being stood up for dinner . Again . " <p> " No , no , of course it is n't , " Jack said , tired of reciting dialogue from a familiar script and the revolving cast of leading ladies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have n't seen each other since Thursday at lunch . " <p> " When I told you I had an out-of-town job to take care of . " An off-the-books , expenses-only one for a friend , Jack might have added , but what was the point ? <p> " Yeah , and I stayed home all weekend , in case you called . " A derisive snort , then a plaintive , " You 've heard about floors clean enough to eat off of ? You could take out somebody 's spleen on mine . " <p> Jack tapped a pencil end over end on the desk blotter . He 'd flown to Seattle by way of Dallas and Denver , logged twelve hours ' sleep in seventy-two and the majority of those after he fell into his own bed last night . " If I 'd had a chance to call , " he said , " and you were n't home , I 'd have tried your cell phone . If you did n't answer , I 'd have left a voice mail . " <p> " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my mind all weekend . " <p> Pretty much , he thought . A bit harsh , maybe , but before he came along , Cherise volunteered on Saturdays at a library teaching English as a second language . Sundays , she 'd meet her married sisters for a girls ' - day- out brunch , then hit the flea markets , catch a chick flick or zip north to Kansas City to shop at malls identical to those in Park City . <p> Sniffling now , Cherise went on , " And you do n't even remember what day this is , do you ? " <p> The obvious trick question disqualified Monday as the correct answer . Jack 's eyes cut to his page-a-day calendar . July 7 was blank , apart from a sticky note to remind him to drop his suit at the cleaners before the bloodstains set . <p> " Who cares if tonight 's our anniversary ? " Sniff-sniffle . " No big deal . " <p> Jack pulled away the receiver , examining the sound holes as if the pattern would reveal what the hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battles , natural and unnatural disasters and wedding ceremonies . None of those applied , yet all of a sudden , the commonality seemed oddly significant . <p> " For six months , I 've put up with your weird hours . With dates canceled at the last minute and knowing your mind 's anywhere but on me sometimes when we are together . But have I complained ? Uh-uh . Not even once . " <p> I wish you had , Jack thought . Repeatedly and often . <p> On a shelf above the microwave at his apartment was a framed sampler that read : " The lower the expectations , the higher the probability a man will tunnel under them . " His ex-wife had cross-stitched it and given it to him for a divorce present . Whether she 'd coined the phrase , or copped it from Gloria Steinem , a louse with good intentions should have it tattooed on his forehead . <p> " I 'm sorry , Cherise , " he said . " I really am . " <p> A lengthy silence acknowledged the subtext @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ implied a middle-distance stare at the ceiling , select memories scrolling behind her eyes , her head shaking in futility . The image skewed somewhat at her muttered , " Honesty in a relationship , my ass . " <p> Jack scowled . " Hey , now wait a sec . I have been honest with you . A hundred percent from the first time we went out . " <p> " Sure you were , " she agreed . " But how was I supposed to know that ? " <p> His mouth fell open . Bereft of an intelligible response , he raked his fingers through his hair and wondered if a lapsed Episcopalian was eligible for the priesthood . <p> " First date , " she said . " Between the beer course and the pizza , I asked you to describe the perfect woman . I expected the usual answers  --  Julia Roberts , Angelina Jolie , Salma Hayek . If you 'd said your mother , I would n't have stuck around for the cinnamon bread . " <p> Jack could do worse than a gal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And had more times than he cared to count . " For the record , my mom 's a wonderful woman , but not exactly my type . " <p> " I gathered that when you said ' The perfect woman for any man does n't confuse supportive with taking his crap and making excuses for him . ' " Cherise laughed . " Ten points for creativity , but you really did n't expect me to believe it , did you ? " <p> Actually , he had . For one , it was the truth . Plain , simple , straightforward . For another <p> He did n't have another . Could n't imagine why he 'd need it . " Look , I  --  " <p> " Do n't , okay ? Let 's leave it at we had fun , it 's over , no hard feelings , time to move on . " Cherise hesitated a moment , her voice somber , the drawl more pronounced . " I 'm gon na miss you , though . " <p> Jack nodded , as if she were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cubicle with less square footage than a municipal jail cell . " Same here , kid , " he said , curbing the impulse to suggest a fresh start . <p> Barring dual amnesia , there was no such thing as a mulligan in a relationship . Jack 's crazy uncle George once owned a beater Oldsmobile that would n't shift out of Reverse , but for most people , going backward to go forward was a dumb idea . <p> Cherise knew that as well as he did . " Let 's leave it " was code for " Goodbyes hurt , but we are n't in love and in like is n't enough for the long haul . " Still , the handset 's glowing redial button dared Jack to ask her forgiveness . To give him a second chance at being the dependable , thoughtful guy she deserved . <p> Uh-huh . Sure . He docked the phone . And while he was at it , he 'd learn Parsi , buy season tickets to the opera and take up water polo . <p> By noon , Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sent to Cherise 's cubicle . Figuring she 'd understand the quantity , but not the symbolism in their color , he 'd asked the clerk to write " I 'll never forget you " on the card . Although sincere , his latest failed romance was the last thing on his mind as he cruised by the Midwest Inn 's guest entrance . <p> The three-story , stucco-clad motel was situated on a backfilled knoll facing I-44 's prime business interchange . From the air , the building was shaped like a capital M with a swimming pool puddled between its legs . Tourists seldom traveled through southwest Missouri in helicopters , so the snazzy architecture was wasted on pigeons , drive-time traffic reporters and the local hang gliders ' club . <p> The all but deserted rear parking lot angled in concert with the M 's ascender points . Jack knew the checkout time was 11:00 a.m. , and check-ins were prohibited before 3:00 p.m . The black Lexus sedan and a forest-green minivan parked several discretionary spaces apart credenced the adage about rules being made to be broken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folded fifty-dollar bills Jack had slipped to the desk clerk . Two President Grants was the agreed-upon bribe for the clerk to call Jack 's cell phone with Mr. and Mrs. Smith 's room number and precise location . <p> He pulled in beside the Lexus and lowered his side window . It was risky to forgo tailing his quarry to the motel , but he sensed he 'd been spotted at last Friday 's rendezvous at a Best Western across town . The rapid metallic ticks emanating from the Lexus 's engine confirmed the greedy desk clerk 's ETA . <p> Shifting his aging Taurus into Park , Jack left the engine running and snagged an equipment case from the backseat . While the building 's height shaded the asphalt for a few yards behind his car , air-conditioning was n't optional when midday temperatures flirted with the century mark . <p> He snapped photos of both vehicles with a still camera , then switched to a digital . Elbows propped on the steering wheel , he aimed the telephoto lens at room 266 's plate-glass window and adjusted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the slats tilted down , rather than up . From Jack 's or anyone else 's ground-level vantage point , the interior view was akin to lurking at the bottom of a stairway to peek up a lady 's skirt . <p> Motels and hotels provide drapes for a reason , and it was n't just to give the bedspreads something to match . If married couples hot for a nooner with someone other than a spouse knew how the law defined an expectation of privacy , Jack would have to find another line of work . <p> Domestics were n't his specialty . Maximum sleaze factor and aggravation  --  minimum challenge . But it 'd been a slow summer and a guy 's just got ta do what a guy 's got ta do to cover the rent . Whether Cherise believed his excuse for canceling their date tonight or not , Jack had n't lied about meeting a client for dinner . Hopefully there would n't be a scene , until after he 'd polished off his steak and steamed veggies . Either way , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ craving a long shower . <p> A couple more shots of the lovebirds ' striptease were all Jack needed and all he could stomach . The camera was whining its second electronic high C when the Taurus 's passenger door swung open . The young man tilted the whole car as he crammed himself into the seat . " Mr. McPhee , " he said , huffing a bit from the exertion . " This is your lucky day . " <p> A fleshy inner tube oozed from under his rock-band T-shirt and spilled over the waistband of his jeans . He smelled like a deep-fried Esquire cologne sample . Two days ' growth of stubble fanned from a goatee and bristled his chins . A ham-sized knee , then the other , wedged against the glove compartment . The .38 Police Special inside might as well have been in a bank vault in Wisconsin . <p> Then again , if Moby Dick was a carjacker , he 'd need the Jaws of Life to stuff that gut behind the steering wheel . Jack eyed a manila folder clutched in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a subpoena at him and waddled off . There 'd be balloons and a camera crew if the dude was with that magazine outfit 's prize patrol . Besides , you had to enter to win . <p> " Who the hell are you ? " <p> " Brett Dean Blankenship . " He offered his hand . Jack did n't take it . Nonplussed , he went on , " Pleasure to meet you , sir , but who you are is why I 'm here . " <p> A smirk exposed teeth not many years removed from orthodontic appliances . Attention turning to the folder , Blankenship recited , " You 'll be forty-one on October 4 . Married once , divorced , no kids  --  " he glanced sideward and heh-hehed "  --  as far as known . You 've gotaB.S. in criminal justice , graduated from the Park City Police Academy , then resigned two years later . You bounced around from rent-a-cop to long-haul trucking , dabbled in auto repair , retail sales and telemarketing . For the past fifteen years , you 've been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to " marginally successful . " He 'd had many a good year and a fair share of great ones . Self-employment ordained lean ones proportional to sweet ones . It kept you humble and out there hustling . Or it should . <p> " Not too shabby for a one-man operation . " Blankenship handed over three sheets of paper . " But it 's safe to say , you ai n't setting the world on fire . " <p> The pages ' bulleted lines noted Jack 's Social Security number , previous and current home and office addresses , savings and checking account balances , registration info on the Taurus and his pickup , average utility bills at his office and apartmentJunior G-man stuff either in public records or easily obtainable if you knew where to look . <p> What raised Jack 's hackles was an account of his activities over the past week . Blankenship had tailed him and Jack had n't even noticed . Which explained the Lexus driver 's sudden hinki-ness last Friday . <p> He balled the sheets and tossed them into the backseat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not playing . Now get outa my car , before you void the warranty on the shock absorbers . " <p> Blankenship blanched , then exhaled , as though a lung had collapsed . " I worked like a dog on that report . I thought you 'd be impressed . " He stretched a shirtsleeve to mop the sweat trickling down his muttonchops . " The correspondence school instructor said that showing we can run background checks is the best rTsumT we can have . " <p> God deliver Jack from schmucks with matchbook private-detective-school diplomas . And from the Missouri law mandating a year 's apprenticeship with a licensed investigator . That and a written exam weeded out the wanna-be overnight Sam Spades , but presented certain liability issues . Like men-torship being a pain in the butt for a working , marginally successful P.I . <p> " I live with my mom , so I can work for free , " Blankenship wheedled . " Double the manpower , double your billable hours . Maybe triple ' em . " <p> Halve them was more like it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needs a concrete flak jacket . " Sorry , but like you said , McPhee Investigations is a one-man agency . " <p> " It was n't when it was Gregory , Aimes &amp; Watkins . " Blankenship shrugged . " Okay , so Watkins was dead and Aimes 's wheel was throwing spokes before Chuck Gregory took you on . If it had n't been for him , you would n't have a license , much less your name painted on the window . " <p> With uncustomary patience , Jack said , " I was in the right place at the right time . " His inflection relayed as opposed to you . " Chuck wanted to retire and he loved showing rookies the ropes . Me , I 'd rather hang myself with them . " <p> Desperation edged Blankenship 's laugh . " Come on , gim me a thirty-day trial . If it does n't work out , no hard feelings . At least I 'll have a month 's experience to add to my rTsumT . " <p> Jack 's eyes rose to room 266 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the time Blankenship extricated himself from the passenger 's seat , Mr. and Mrs. Smith could waltz out arm in arm from the building 's rear entrance . <p> He 'd also bet McPhee Investigations had n't topped Blankenship 's list of employment prospects . The Park City telephone directory 's business pages advertised about two dozen agencies , including a pricey nationally franchised outfit . If the kid had a brain , he 'd started there and worked his way down . <p> " What I will do , " Jack said , stashing the camera equipment on the floorboard , " is give you some friendly advice , while I drive you around front to your vehicle . " <p> " It is n't here . " Blankenship yanked on the shoulder harness . " I took a cab so I would n't blow your surveillance . " <p> Well , well . That hiked Jack 's previous estimation a few notches . Not enough to hire him , but maybe the kid had a brighter future than he thought . Wheeling around the motel 's east side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1010 West Danbury .
