<p> Two Contra Costa County firefighters lost their lives Saturday after they were caught in an explosion of flames as they tried unsuccessfully to rescue a couple from their burning home in unincorporated San Pablo , authorities said . <p> A seemingly routine call for help quickly turned disastrous with four lives lost , and left the 300-member Contra Costa County Fire Protection District reeling from the first on-duty deaths in its history . <p> Contra Costa County Fire Protection District Capt . Matt Burton , 34 , of Concord , Fire Engineer Scott Desmond , 37 , of Brentwood , and residents Delbert Moore , 67 , and Gayle Moore , 62 , died in the blaze at the couple 's ranch-style , one-story home on Michele Drive in the Montalvin Manor neighborhood , authorities said . <p> The firefighters had managed to pull one victim from the home and were trying to find the other person when they were caught in a " flashover , " which happens when hot gases build up in a building and cause bursts of flame to erupt , said Fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it out , " Richter said . " Obviously , this is a devastating loss for the district and certainly for their families . Our hearts go out to them .

Desmond was usually based at an Antioch fire station . On Saturday , he and Burton were assigned to the San Pablo station , said fire Capt . Bob Atlas . <p> " Scott was my best friend , " said Atlas , who graduated with Desmond in the same county fire-academy class eight years ago . " He was a tremendous individual with phenomenal skills . Everybody liked him . I do n't think there was a single person that did n't have a great comment to say about him . He was a salt-of-the-earth guy . " <p> The firefighters ' deaths underscore the dangers they face on the job , Atlas said .

Her husband had served as local San Pablo Eagles president . Both smoked , and the cause of the blaze was under investigation . <p> " It 's bad . I was down there watching it , " said Montalvin Manor resident Sharon Cook , 50 , as she walked her dog , Faye . " It 's a dangerous job , and it 's something they do n't get much appreciation for . They just figure it 's their duty , their job , but they do n't realize that firefighters have lives and families .

They were found in the same general area inside the home , Richter said , without elaborating . <p> The firefighters who died wore standard gear , including coats , helmets and self-contained breathing apparatus , but the material " wo n't stand up for very long " under intense heat from a flashover , Richter said . <p> Richter said there were no indications that there was a delayed response by firefighters or problems with water pressure . <p> Contra Costa fire and sheriff 's investigators cordoned off part of Michele Drive as they documented the scene and tried to determine what started the blaze .

Flowers adorned the engine 's front bumper as well as Fire Station 70 on San Pablo Avenue .

" It 's going to be a slow and painful process .
