Just by listening through a stethoscope to the sounds inside your chest , a well-practiced doctor can tell whether a valve in your heart is leaky , you have a touch of pneumonia in your lungs or your heart is n't pumping as much blood as your body needs . In many cases , a subtle change in the pattern of bodily noises can alert your physician to problems long before symptoms appear . Unfortunately , the art of auscultation , the technical term for listening to those sounds , is slowly dying . Seasoned physicians complain that their younger colleagues are simply more comfortable ordering high-tech  --  and more costly  --  computerized scans to make diagnoses . <P> Enter Dr. Michael Barrett , 57 , of Temple University in Philadelphia . A cardiologist by training , Barrett started playing with his new CD burner a few years ago and got to thinking that maybe the way medical schools teach their students to use the stethoscope is all wrong . Typically , he says , students attend a basic lecture and listen to a couple of practice recordings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspected that they needed more repetition for their brains to assimilate the patterns dependably . <P> Barrett started giving his students CDs on which he had recreated the rhythm and nature of various kinds of heart murmurs . He used a mechanical simulator to produce the purest patterns ( and to avoid disturbing a lot of patients ) . But when he asked some of the students whether they were listening to their CDs , they told him , as he recalls , " Gee , Dr. Barrett , no one listens to CDs anymore . We 've uploaded everything onto our iPods . " <P> So after consulting with a computer-savvy nephew , Barrett turned his heart recordings into iPod-readable M files . They worked even better than the CDs , he found ; students could see the title of each " song " they played . <P> How often would you have to listen to those heart sounds before you could reliably identify various types of murmurs ? About 500 times , according to a study Barrett published last week in the American Journal of Medicine . The students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after listening to their iPods for two to three hours . A score in the 80s , Barrett says , is about as good as that of most practicing cardiologists.
