" Miss Kendall , can you hear me ? I 'm Doctor Metcalf , and you 're at Good Samaritan Hospital in Mountainside . We 're going to take you out of the ambulance now and into the emergency room . " Shivering uncontrollably , Leigh Kendall reacted to the insistent male voice that was calling her back to consciousness , but she could n't seem to summon the strength to open her eyelids . " Can you hear me , Miss Kendall ? " With an effort , she finally managed to force her eyes open . The doctor who had spoken was bending over her , examining her head , and beside him , a nurse was holding a clear plastic bag of IV fluid . " We 're going to take you out of the ambulance now , " he repeated as he beamed a tiny light at each of her pupils . " Need ... to tell ... husband I 'm here , " Leigh managed in a feeble whisper . He nodded and gave her hand a reassuring squeeze . " The State @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meantime , you have some very big fans at Good Samaritan , including me , and we 're going to take excellent care of you . " Voices and images began to fly at Leigh from every direction as the gurney was lifted from the ambulance . Red and blue lights pulsed frantically against a gray dawn sky . Uniforms flashed past her line of vision-NewYork State Highway Patrol officers , paramedics , doctors , nurses . Doors swung open , the hallway flew by , faces crowded around her , firing urgent questions at her . Leigh tried to concentrate , but their voices were collapsing into an incomprehensible babble , and their features were sliding off their faces , dissolving into the same blackness that had already devoured the rest of the room . * * * * When Leigh awoke again , it was dark outside and a light snow was still falling . Struggling to free herself from the effects of whatever drugs were dripping into her arm from the IV bag above her , she gazed dazedly at what appeared to be a hospital room filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair near the foot of the bed , flanked by a huge basket of purple orchids and a large vase of bright yellow roses , a gray-haired nurse was reading a copy of The New York Times with Leigh 's picture on the front page . Leigh turned her head as much as the brace on her neck would allow , searching for some sign of Logan , but for the time being , she was alone with the nurse . Experimentally , she moved her legs and wiggled her toes , and was relieved to find them still attached to the rest of her and in good working order . Her arms were bandaged and her head was wrapped in something tight , but as long as she did n't move , her discomfort seemed to be limited to a generalized ache throughout her body , a sharper ache in her ribs , and a throat so dry it felt as if it was stuffed with gauze . She was alive , and that in itself was a miracle ! The fact that she was also whole and relatively unharmed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was almost euphoric . She swallowed and forced a croaking whisper from her parched throat . " May I have some water ? " The nurse looked up , a professional smile instantly brightening her face . " You 're awake ! " she said as she quickly closed the newspaper , folded it in half , and laid it face-down beneath her chair . The name tag on the nurse 's uniform identified her as " Ann Mackey , RN . Private Duty , " Leigh noted as she watched the nurse pouring water from a plastic pitcher on the tray beside the bed . " You should have a straw . I 'll go get one . " " Do n't bother about that right now . I 'm really thirsty . " Smiling sympathetically , the nurse started to hold the glass to Leigh 's mouth , but Leigh took it from her . " I can hold it , " Leigh assured her , and then was amazed by how much effort it took just to lift her bandaged arm and hold it steady . By the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her arm was trembling and her chest hurt terribly . Wondering if perhaps there was more wrong with her than she 'd thought , Leigh let her head sink back into the pillows while she gathered the strength to talk . " What sort of condition am I in ? " Nurse Mackey looked eager to share her knowledge , but she hesitated . " You really should ask Dr. Metcalf about that . " " I will , but I 'd like to hear it now , from my private duty nurse . I wo n't tell him you told me anything . " It was all the encouragement the elderly woman needed . " You were in shock when you were brought in , " she confided . " You had a concussion , hypothermia , cracked ribs , and suspected injuries to the cervical vertebrae and adjacent tissue-that 's whiplash in laymen 's terms . You have several deep scalp wounds as well as lacerations on your arms , legs , and torso , but only a few of them are on your face , and they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have contusions and abrasions all over your - " Smiling , Leigh lifted her hand to stop the litany of injuries . " That 's too much detail . Is there anything wrong with me now that will need surgery ? " Nurse Mackey looked taken aback by Leigh 's dismissive attitude , and then she looked impressed . " No surgery , " she said with an approving little pat on Leigh 's shoulder . " Any physical therapy ? " " I would n't think so . But you should expect to be very sore for a few weeks , and your ribs will hurt . Your burns and cuts will require close attention , healing and scaring could be a concern - " Leigh interrupted this new deluge of depressing medical minutia with another smile . " I 'll be very careful , " she promised , and then she switched to the only other topic on her mind . " Where is my husband ? " Nurse Mackey faltered and then patted Leigh 's shoulder again . " I 'll go and see about that , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impression that Logan was nearby . Exhausted from the simple acts of drinking and speaking , Leigh closed her eyes and tried to piece together what had happened to her since yesterday , when Logan kissed her good bye in the morning . He 'd been so excited when he left their East Side apartment , so eager for her to join him in the mountains and spend the night with him there . For nearly two years , he 'd been looking for just the right site for their mountain retreat , a secluded setting that would complement the sprawling stone house he 'd designed for the two of them . On Thursday , he 'd finally found a piece of property that met all his exacting qualifications , and he 'd been so eager for her to see it that he insisted they should spend Sunday night - their first available night - in the existing cabin on the land . " The cabin has n't been used in years , but I 'll clean it up while I 'm waiting for you to get there , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he normally diligently avoided . " There is n't any electricity or heat , but I 'll build a roaring fire in the fireplace , and we 'll sleep in front of it in sleeping bags . We 'll have dinner by candlelight . In the morning , we 'll watch the sun rise over the tops of the trees . Our trees . It will be very romantic , you 'll see . " His entire plan filled Leigh with amused dread . She was starring in a new play that had opened on Broadway the night before , and she 'd only had four hours of sleep . Before she could leave for the mountains , she had a Sunday matinee performance to give , followed by a three-hour drive to a cold , uninhabitable stone cabin , so that she could sleep on the floor ... and then get up at dawn the next day . " I ca n't wait , " she lied with an affectionate smile , but what she really wanted to do was go back to sleep . It was only eight o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had any more sleep than she , but he was already dressed and eager to leave for the cabin . " The place is n't easy to find , so I drew you a detailed map with plenty of landmarks , " he said , laying a piece of paper on her nightstand . " I 've already loaded the car . I think I have everything I need - " he continued , leaning over her in bed and pressing a quick kiss on her cheek . " - house plans , stakes , string , a transom , sleeping bags . I still feel like I 'm forgetting something ... " " A broom , a mop , and a bucket ? " Leigh joked sleepily as she rolled over onto her stomach . " Scrub brushes ? Detergent ? " " Kill-joy , " he teased , nuzzling her neck where he knew she was ticklish . Leigh giggled , pulled the pillow over the back of her head , and continued dictating his shopping list . " Disinfectant ... mouse traps ... " " You sound like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Where is your sense of adventure ? " " It stops at a Holiday Inn , " she said with a muffled giggle . With a laugh , he pulled the pillow from her head and rumpled her hair . " Leave straight from the theater . Do n't be late . " He stood up and headed for the door to their bedroom suite . " I know I 'm forgetting something - " " Drinking water , candles , a tin coffee pot ? " Leigh helpfully chanted . " Food for dinner ? A pear for my breakfast ? " " No more pears . You 're addicted , " he teased over his shoulder . " From now on , it 's Cream of Wheat and prunes for you . " " Sadist , " Leigh mumbled into the pillows , but she was smiling . A moment later she heard the door close behind him , and she rolled onto her back , smiling to herself as she gazed out the bedroom windows overlooking Central Park . They 'd both been very young and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only assets had been Logan 's brand new degree in architecture and Leigh 's unproven acting talent-that , and their unflagging faith in each other . With those tools , they 'd built a wonderful life together and strengthened it over the next thirteen years . During the last few months however , they 'd both been so busy that their sex life had become almost nonexistent . She 'd been immersed in the pre-opening craziness of a new play , and Logan had been consumed with the endless complexities of his latest , and biggest , business venture . As Leigh lay in bed , gazing out at the clouds gathering in the November sky , she decided she definitely liked the prospect of spending the night by a blazing fire , with nothing to do but make love with her husband . * * * * She 'd hoped to leave the theater by four o'clock that afternoon , but the play 's director and the writer both decided to make minor changes after watching the matinee performance , and then they argued endlessly over which changes to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As a result , it was after six when Leigh and the rest of the cast finally left the theater . Patchy fog mixed with light snow slowed her progress out of the city . Leigh tried to call Logan twice on his cellular phone to tell him she was going to be late , but he 'd either left his phone on the charger in his car or else the cabin was beyond range of his cellular service . She left voice mail messages for him instead . By the time she reached the mountains , the snow was falling hard and fast , whipped into a frenzy by the wind . Leigh 's Mercedes sedan was heavy and handled well , but the snow was deep and coming down so fast , she could only see a few feet beyond her headlights . The driving was treacherous ; the visibility so poor that it was difficult to see road signs , let alone spot the little landmarks Logan had noted on his map . Roadside restaurants and gas stations that would normally be open at ten PM were closed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and ask for directions , Leigh kept driving . Twice , she doubled back , certain she 'd missed a landmark or a road . When she should have been within a mile or two of the cabin , she turned into an unmarked driveway with a fence across it and switched on the car 's map light to study Logan 's map and directions again . She was almost positive she 'd missed a turnoff a mile back , the one Logan had described as being " 200 feet south of a sharp curve in the road , just beyond a little red barn . " With at least six inches of snow blanketing everything , what had seemed like a little barn to her could just as easily have been a large black shed , a short silo , or a pile of frozen cows , but Leigh decided she should go back and find out . She put the Mercedes into gear and made a cautious U turn . As she rounded the sharp curve she was looking for , she slowed down even more , searching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too steep , the terrain far too rugged , for anyone to have put a driveway there . She 'd just taken her foot off the brake and started to accelerate when a pair of headlights on high beam leapt out of the darkness behind her , rounding the curve , closing the distance with terrifying speed . On the snow-covered roads , Leigh could n't speed up quickly and the other driver could n't seem to slow down . He swerved into the left lane to avoid plowing into her from the rear , lost control , and smashed into the Mercedes just behind Leigh 's door . The memory of what followed was horrifyingly vivid-the explosion of air bags , the scream of tortured metal and shattering glass as the Mercedes plowed through the guardrail and began cart wheeling down the steep embankment . Tree trunks rammed at the car , metal collapsed , and heavy objects tore at her flesh and slammed into her head . She remembered the explosive jolt as 5,000 pounds of mangled metal finally came to a bone-breaking stop . Suspended from her seat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dazed bat in a cave while light began exploding around her . Bright light . Colorful light . Yellow and orange and red . Fire ! Stark terror sharpened her senses . She found the seat belt release , landed hard on the roof of the overturned car and , whimpering , tried to crawl through the hole that had once been the passenger window . Blood , sticky and wet , spread down her arms and legs and dripped into her eyes . Her coat was too bulky for the opening , and she was yanking it off when whatever had stopped the car 's descent suddenly gave way . Leigh heard herself screaming as the burning car pitched forward , rolled , and then seemed to fly out over thin air , before it began a downward plunge that ended in a deafening splash and a freezing deluge of icy water . Lying in her hospital bed with her eyes closed , Leigh relived that plunge into the water , and her heart began to race . Moments after hitting the water , the car began a fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she started pounding on everything she could reach . She found a hole above her , a large one , and with her lungs bursting , she pushed through it and fought with her remaining strength to reach the surface . It seemed an eternity later before a blast of frigid wind hit her face and she gulped in air . She tried to swim , but pain knifed through her chest with every breath , and her strokes were too feeble and uncoordinated to propel her forward more than a little bit . Leigh kept thrashing about in the water , but her frozen body was going numb , and neither her panic nor her determination could give her the strength to swim . Her head was sliding under the surface , when her flailing hand struck something hard and rough-the limb of a partially submerged fallen tree . Continues ...
