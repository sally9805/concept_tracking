<p> New York  --  There are a million stories in the Naked City , but , at last count , only 63 jazz clubs . <p> Give or take a few . And if you count merely the name establishments you can narrow the short list to about a dozen . The days when two jam-packed single blocks  --  52nd Street in the 1940s  --  could alone account for much of the glory in the music are gone . They live only in the sepia reveries of Ken Burns documentaries . <p> Yet , jazz is so strongly rooted here that the city is unimaginable without it . Or the habitats where the music flourishes : the after-hours dives and swanky tourist parlors , neighborhood hangs and bohemian basements , shoebox bistros and art deco landmarks . <p> The traveler who only has a weekend to sample the best of them can easily explore a vivid cross section of clubs , enjoying all kinds of styles and attitudes that constitute jazz a century after its birth . <p> Here 's a personal Top 5 , based as much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although that counts , too . <p> Smoke <p> Alas , since Mayor Michael Bloomberg 's ban on tobacco use inside drinking establishments , no one smokes at Smoke anymore . At least , not off the bandstand , where some of the best traditional jazz players in the city cut loose and stay late , smoking in the metaphorical sense . <p> No other jazz club in New York comes close to matching this Upper West Side haunt for sheer velvet-swathed , old-school atmosphere . It 's a vibe redolent of jazz photography of the 1950s and ' 60s , which captured such icons as Dexter Gordon or Miles Davis in romantic chiaroscuro , swathed in a nicotine haze . <p> The venue , which also is popular as a neighborhood bar , does its best to encourage such an aura : Tuesday night groove sessions feature the whiskey-warm glow of a Hammond B-3 organ , for instance , and notable young stars such as Brad Mehldau and Jacky Terrasson make a habit of dropping in for the weekend straight-ahead sets ( if they 're not playing a low-key gig @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past as Augie 's , a loosely managed staple of undergraduate life at nearby Columbia University , the address has a strong appeal for once-obscure musicians who got their first taste of the spotlight here . And the closely arranged seating , customized for knee-to-knee coziness , means even first-time patrons do n't stay strangers for long . <p> Jazz Standard <p> You can eat barbecue and have your jazz , too , at this club in the East 20s neighborhood known as Rose Hill . <p> Since restaurateur Danny Meyer took over the struggling site in 2001 , the 250-seat venue has happily combined the best of both worlds : smoky , down-home cuisine and a bandstand that welcomes some of the sharpest musicians in town . <p> Upstairs is Blue Smoke , a sprawling restaurant and bar that balances urban style with an invitingly casual air . Downstairs is the Standard , which has set a new standard for how smartly upscale jazz clubs can be booked and managed . <p> The site 's geographical status  --  neither uptown nor downtown  --  carries over to the stage , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as readily as conceptual tricksters such as Steven Bernstein , whose Millennial Territory Orchestra makes many Monday nights a giddy excursion to the far side of big band deviltry . <p> Unlike similar venues where food is served , there 's no drink minimum . In fact , you can order a free glass of water and expect no hassle . Cover charges are less exorbitant , and the first show is always at 7:30 p.m . However , you 'll be missing half the fun if you do n't try some ' cue , which matches up zestily with the establishment 's own Blue Smoke ale . <p> The Village Vanguard <p> Nothing is as constant in New York as change , but somehow this most venerated of West Village nightclubs keeps on keeping on . After 68 years , not only is the Vanguard still open every night of the week , it 's nowhere close to becoming a museum . <p> Founding owner Max Gordon could not have imagined what the Vanguard would become when he opened this basement enclave , shaped roughly like a slice of Ray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the staple , and future stars such as Judy Holliday and songwriting team Betty Comden and Adolph Green entertained . <p> By the 1950s , though , jazz was experiencing a postwar creative explosion , and Gordon liked what he heard . The sheer volume of albums with " Live at the Village Vanguard , " many by jazz giants such as John Coltrane , Joe Henderson , Bill Evans and Sonny Rollins , tells you that Gordon 's ears rarely led him astray . The great man 's widow , Lorraine , has carried the torch into the 21st century , and has maintained the club 's no-nonsense policies ( cash only , no dining , no talking , no cellphones ) . But she did put a new door at the Seventh Avenue entrance to the venue , and began adding some new names to the roster of artists who enjoy regular stints here . <p> The Vanguard has broadened its scope from classic piano trios , elder statesmen conversant in swing and hard-bop , and players from the circle of Wynton Marsalis . New wave jazz combo the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trumpet hero Dave Douglas . On occasion , you can still hear a bartender peevishly slam the cash register when he does n't like what he hears onstage . " I just tell them never to do it during a bass solo , " Lorraine Gordon says . <p> Barbes <p> Brooklyn rarely qualifies as a destination for jazz fans . Ironic , since a great many of the city 's busiest players  --  musician 's musicians , the kind who gig constantly without too much fanfare  --  call its brownstones and lofts home . Finally , they have a bar to claim as their own . <p> A fairly recent addition to long-gentrified Park Slope , Barbes takes its name from the Parisian neighborhood where North African immigrants are most populous , and where the bar 's two French expat owners came of age . <p> While the performances in the venue 's tiny back room were initially slanted toward various world musics ( reflective of what you might hear in a Paris Metro station ) , an influx of local jazzers means there 's always a 50 percent chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , string-driven swing or some postmodern cultural hybrid ( neo-Balkan brass bands , the brave new world of accordion stylings , and so on ) , Barbes offers one-stop shopping . <p> The performance space , which holds about 40 people , is cozy enough that the music needs no amplification , lending shows the feel of a home concert . Literally , you may wind up with a banjo player sitting in your lap . Most patrons think that 's a good thing . <p> 55 Bar <p> Fabled as are few existing West Village watering holes , this institution sits between the former Stonewall Inn ( the Alamo of the gay liberation movement ) and the former Lion 's Head Tavern ( the Plymouth Rock of New York 's beer-and-a-shot literati of the 1970s and ' 80s ) . <p> Allegedly won by its original owner in a card game onboard a steamer coming back from World War I , this basement bar has been open since 1919 . Jazz has been on the agenda since at least the early ' 80s , when electric guitarist Mike Stern ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ countless Monday night performances . Over the years , artists as wide-ranging as Jaco Pastorious and Norah Jones have made themselves comfortable here . <p> The 55 is the kind of divey , well-loved joint that musicians frequent even when they are n't gigging  --  and no matter how famous ( or , ahem , infamous ) they become . Legendary pianist Cecil Taylor has long been a regular and , before new management took over last year , you could count on bartenders to regale you with stories about the leonine composer . <p> The shift in ownership has been a boon for the venue : There 's first-rate live music every night . The recent closing of nearby Small 's , which showcased untested talents and rising stars from jazz 's just off-mainstream , seems to have steered a new generation of players in the bar 's direction . Late-night sets make it a handy place to stop by if visits to neighboring clubs ( such as Sweet Rhythm or the Village Vanguard ) leave you hungry for more music . <p> Brooklyn-based free-lance writer Steve Dollar , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ author of " Jazz Guide : New York City " ( Little Bookroom , $15.95 ) . <p> * Smoke , 2751 Broadway ( between 105th and 106th streets ) . 212-864-6622 , www.smokejazz.com . <p> * Jazz Standard , 116 E. 27th St. 212-576-2322 , www.jazzstandard.com . <p> * The Village Vanguard , 178 Seventh Ave .
