Lifting the Veil on Autism <P> Equipped with new findings  --  as well as input from people with autism  --  researchers are getting a better grasp of autistic minds and how they might best be treated . Impassioned specialists and parents let us know of the challenges in tackling the confounding condition but also revealed a degree of optimism <P> Congratulations to TIME and Claudia Wallis for the very fine cover story on autism May 15 . I have been researching and teaching about autism for more than 30 years , and I believe that hers is one of the most accurate and useful articles to appear in the popular press . Autism is being rethought because of fresh insights from individuals with autism and the scientific community . Bravo for having made that new information accessible to the general public . <P> ANNE M. DONNELLAN , PH.D . PROFESSOR , UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO San Diego <P> I particularly appreciated Wallis ' reporting on the two autism intervention programs , Applied Behavior Analysis ( ABA ) and Floortime . The behaviorist method of ABA may still be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interactive techniques are also changing children 's lives . My son attended a preschool using Floortime , and it made all the difference in the world . He blossomed there and is now a bright child with an active social life in a mainstream elementary school . I hope Wallis ' story helps parents who are still in the painful early stages of this journey . <P> TAMAR BIHARI Montclair , N.J. <P> I was very disappointed by TIME 's reporting on ABA and the work of teachers and students at Alpine Learning Group . The most salient fact for parents facing the momentous choices regarding their child 's treatment is that ABA is the only intervention for autism supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies . Properly implemented by well-trained therapists , ABA can help children with autism learn to talk , read , write , relate to their peers and participate fully and productively in their families and communities . ABA is a science , and as behavior analysts , we at Alpine are accountable for every moment we spend with our students . Their days are filled not only with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaching each student 's full development . TIME undersold the potential of ABA and the accomplishments of Alpine 's phenomenal students , families and teachers . <P> BRIDGET A. TAYLOR , PSY.D. , B.C.B.A. EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ALPINE LEARNING GROUP <P> Paramus , N.J. <P> I want to thank TIME for writing an unbiased review of Floortime and ABA . Too many articles prop up one approach over the other without giving an honest summary of both . I work within both models as a special-education teacher . Your article highlights the pros and cons of each in a fair , unbiased way . The goal is to choose what works for an individual child . Many , many children benefit from both models simultaneously or at different times in their childhood . Treatment is not a competition between ideas ; it is a matter of finding what works at a particular moment with an individual child . <P> KELLY CROSBY Rochester , N.Y .
