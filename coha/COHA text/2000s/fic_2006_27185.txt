Chapter One Six months later , Cate sat in her high-backed chair atop the dais , waiting to start the day 's session . The courtroom was packed , and she hid her anticipation behind a professional mask , which was turning out to be a job requirement . The jury trial had taken all last week , but today was the only day that counted , like the final two minutes in a basketball game . Sixers-Hornets . It was on at the bar last night . Wonder who won . Cate shifted behind the slippery wall of stacked pleadings in front of her . She had n't slept well last night and was relying on her concealer , but was otherwise in full costume : synthetic black robes , dark blond hair in a judicial chignon , a swipe of pink gloss on her lips , and neutral makeup on largish , blue eyes . Finally the courtroom deputy flashed Cate a wink . Showtime . Cate gestured to plaintiff 's counsel . " Mr. Temin , let 's begin . I assume that plaintiff continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Honor . " Nathan Temin was a roly-poly lawyer with the paunch of a much older man and a dark suit that begged to be ironed , worn with equally unruly black hair . Still , Cate knew better than to judge a trial lawyer by his cover . She had dressed down for court many times . Prada did n't win jury verdicts . " Excellent . " Cate nodded . " Fire when ready . " " Thank you , Your Honor . " Temin hustled to the podium with a Bic pen and a legal pad , then pressed down his suit with apudgy hand . He greeted the jury and turned to his client , already rising from counsel table . " Mr. Marz , please take the stand . " Richard Marz walked to the witness stand , and necks craned from the gallery . Reporters scribbled away , and sketch artists switched to their flesh-toned chalk . The Eastern District of Pennsylvania did n't allow cameras in the courtroom , for which Cate thanked God and Chief Judge Sherman . " Good morning , Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting down after he was sworn in . He was barely thirty years old , and his baby-blue eyes showed litigation strain . He smiled tightly , his lips taut as a rubber band , and he ran a finger-rake through muddy-brown curls that sprouted from under a crocheted yarmulke . A dark suit jacket popped open over his white shirt , and his striped tie hung unevenly . Everybody knew that people looked like their dogs , but Cate thought they looked like their lawyers . " Good morning , Mr. Marz . " She smiled at Marz in a professional way , feeling subterranean sympathy for his position . He was claiming that a powerful TV producer had stolen his idea for a series about Philadelphia lawyers and developed it into the cable blockbuster Attorneys@Law . In this battle between David and Goliath , Marz held the slingshot . At the lectern , Temin tugged the black bud of a microphone down to his height . " Now , Mr. Marz , you testified last week that you had two meetings with Mr. Simone , leading up to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place at the first meeting , on June 10 . " " Objection , Your Honor , " said George Hartford , defense counsel . Hartford had gray eyes behind slightly tinted bifocals and was prematurely bald . He had to be about fifty , and stood tall and fit in a slim Italian suit with a yellow silk tie . " Asked and answered . Plaintiff 's counsel is wasting the jury 's time . " Temin said , " Your Honor , it 's appropriate to review this proof because the weekend intervened . " " Overruled . " Cate shot both lawyers her sternest look . " Let 's not let the objections get out of hand today , boys . Play nice . " " Thank you , Your Honor . " Temin nodded , but a cranky Hartford eased back in his chair next to his client , producer Art Simone . Even seated , Simone looked tall and trim , in his prime at a prosperous forty-something . His reddish hair had been shorn fashionably close to his scalp , and his tortoiseshell glasses paired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If Marz and Temin were the mutts in this dogfight , Simone and Hartford were purebred afghans . " Mr. Marz , " Temin began again , " tell us briefly what happened at the June meeting with Mr. Simone . " " Well , my background is from the DA 's office , handling cases concerning computer fraud and Internet crime . I always liked computers . " Marz sounded almost apologetic . " But I wanted to be a writer , so I started writing a screenplay for a TV show about four lawyers and how they use computer skills to solve murders . I called it Hard Drive . It was my wife who said , ' Why do n't you do something about it ? ' " Marz smiled at his wife in the front row of the gallery , a sweet-faced brunette wearing a long skirt and sensible shoes . " So I called Art-Mr . Simone-and told him what I was doing and asked if he would meet with me about it , and he agreed to fly out to Philly to take the meeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " That 's what they call it in L.A. , ' taking a meeting . ' When they say no , they call it ' taking a hard pass . ' A ' soft pass ' is a maybe . I thought a soft pass was about sex , but what do I know ? " The jurors chuckled with evident warmth . Nobody loved underdogs like Philly . Temin asked , " Had you known Mr. Simone , prior ? " " Yes , I knew him from summer camp from when I was , like , ten years old . Camp Willowbark , Unit A. He was my senior counselor , and I looked up to him like a big brother . I heard he was doing TV in Hollywood , so I hoped he 'd help me out . " " And what happened at the meeting , briefly ? " " We met at Le Bec Fin and I told him all the details about my idea and asked him would he consider it for his production company . The lead lawyer in my series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Philly who dresses great and is , like , a tie freak- " " You need n't repeat the details , " Temin interjected , preempting Hartford 's objection . " Okay , right , sorry . All that 's important is that the four lawyers I told Mr. Simone about ended up being exactly like the four lawyers on Attorneys@Law . " " Objection , opinion ! " Hartford said , and Cate waved him off . " Overruled . The jury knows it 's his opinion .... ( Continues ... )
