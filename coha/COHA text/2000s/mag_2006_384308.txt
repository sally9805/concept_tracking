China 's most populous and dynamic city dazzles with its imposing skyscrapers and stylish new hotels , restaurants and shops . It 's a metropolis for the modern age . // JAW-DROPPING AWE-that 's the invariable reaction of firsttime visitors to Shanghai upon witnessing the city 's futuristic skyline and experiencing its seething streets , vibrant atmosphere and breakneck speed . If there is a dollar to be made or a demand to be satisfied , someone in Shanghai is certain to be on the case , working at the frantic pace that has become the hallmark of China 's most enterprising city . This east-coast Chinese port is changing more quickly than any other place on earth . Even the most die-hard socialites and dedicated followers of fashion struggle to keep track of the stream of restaurants , bars , boutiques and hotels opening up in the soaring modern high-rises , classic colonial buildings and quaint back alleyways . People are coming to Shanghai 's get-rich-quick party from all over the world , anxious to be part of what many commentators say will be the Chinese Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an expatriate who saw a niche and quickly capitalized on it : the former sales and marketing executive has made a career of renovating and selling the glorious pre-1950s Western-style residences that are scattered around Shanghai , many of them in the tree-lined French Concession . Recently , Yu and two pals opened A Future Perfect , the Shanghai smart set 's restaurant du jour ( Lane 351 , House 16 , Huashan Road ; 011-8621-6248-8020 ; **25;1378;TOOLONG ) . The intimate eatery , adjacent to the Old House Inn , combines an elegant building with modern cuisine to irresistibly glamorous effect . The same formula is repeated all over Shanghai , with grand British and French structures converted , at considerable expense , into contemporary restaurant-and-bar complexes such as Sasha 's ( Number 11 , Dongping Road ; 011-86-21-6474-6628 ; sashas-shang hai.com ) and the Face bar , with the adjoining Indian Hazara and the upstairs Lan Na Thai restaurants ( Building 4 Ruijin Guest House , Ruijin Er Road ; 011-86-216466-4328 ) . There are a number of stately old hotels , the prime example being the Peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) , where Charlie Chaplin stayed and Nol Coward put the finishing touches on Private Lives . With its colorful history and Art Deco style , it rates a visit-perhaps for a drink at the famous Old Jazz Barbut you would be more comfortable staying at a newer property . Limited by structures built to suit bygone eras , the older hotels can not compete with contemporary ones in creature comforts , stateof-the-art facilities and slick service . The newest of Shanghai 's accommodations is Tower 2 , recently opened at the eight-year-old Pudong Shangri-La ( 33 Fucheng Road ; 011-86-21-6882-8888 ; shangri-la.com ) , where the five-star hotel group has installed an additional 375 guest rooms and suites , a branch of its signature CHI spa and a cluster of tony restaurants , including Jade on 36 , which was designed by the much-in-demand Adam D. Tihany . The Shangri-La is on the eastern bank of the busy Huangpu River , which runs through the city . Next door is the Grand Hyatt Shanghai ( 88 Century Boulevard ; 011-86-21-5049-1234 ; shanghai.grand.hyatt com ) , the world 's highest hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-seventh-floor lounge , Cloud 9 , offers a giddy view across the bustling waterway toward the famous Bund promenade . The Grand Hyatt 's $540 million shiny silver design was inspired by the lines of a traditional pagoda , but inside , it is ultramodern , with Minimalist room decor and full-length windows that provide extraordinary vistas of the packed urban landscape that an estimated 17 million to 20 million call home . Shanghainese unblushingly boast that they are the most stylish , the most cultured and the most entrepreneurial of the 1.3 billion people in China . They are also rather proud of their city 's past : during the 1920s and 1930s , Shanghai was known throughout the world as the Paris of the East , a rumbustious place of seductive movie stars , dodgy opium dens , Chinese gangsters , shady expatriate traders , highsociety balls , White Russian aristocrats and grand European-style mansions . When the Communists took over , in 1949 , they eradicated the sleaze , snuffed out any trace of fun and commandeered the choicest buildings for the Party . In recent years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crumbling edifices , most notably Three on the Bund . Built by a British insurance company , it is now a lifestyle emporium with a branch of Giorgio Armani on the ground floor , a day spa , an art gallery and the farthestflung outpost of the New York-based fusion maestro Jean-Georges Vongerichten , where the city 's nouveau riche do not flinch at paying $93 a head for his tasting menu ( Three on the Bund , Fourth Floor , 3 Zhong Shan Dong Yi Road ; 011-86-21-63217733 ; threeonthebund.com ) . " I tell people that Shanghai is very much like New York , with lots of energy and lots of different things going on , hustling and bustling , " says Vongerichten . " I have been coming here every three or four months for almost six years . It has changed so much . There is always something happening . It is fast-maybe too fast . Shanghai is catching up to the rest of the world 's major cities . " The pride and joy of Shanghainese is Xintiandi , an area of once-dilapidated mid-19th-century shikiimen houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been given a face-lift so radical that it feels more like a film-set version of Old Shanghai than the real deal . It is a great place for wandering around-Chinese tour parties from the provinces are taken there to gawk at the novel ( for them ) sight of their well-off compatriots mingling freely with foreigners . The mostly international food at the Xintiandi restaurants is no great shakes . An exception is the fare at the authentic Ye Shanghai ( 338 Huangpi South Road ; 011-86-21-63112323 ) and the Italian Va Bene ( House 7 North Block , Xintiandi , 181 Taicang Road ; 011-86-21-6311-2211 ) , both replicas of successful Hong Kong ventures . Also in the complex is the boutique hotel 88 Xintiandi ( 380 Huangpi South Road ; 011-86-21-5383-8833 ; www.88xinti andi.com ) , a cozy luxury property whose rooms blend marvelously atmospheric Chinese furniture and fixtures with bestof-the-West bathroom and communication facilities . For more traditional Western-style comfort , there are choices galore , including the Four Seasons Hotel Shanghai ( 500 Weihai Road ; 011-86-216256-8888 ; www.fourseasons.com ) , which is close to Nanjing Road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the JW Marriott Hotel Shanghai , on the evocatively named Tomorrow Square ( 399 Nanjing West Road ; 011-86-21-5359-4969 ; marriotthotels.com ) . Not that Shanghai visitors are likely to spend much time lolling around in their rooms with such a thrilling city to explore . A must-see is the Dongtai or Liuhe Road antiques market , where scores of stores sell furniture , paintings , jewelry , pottery , ornaments and even " antique " copies of Chairman Mao 's Little Red Book . Haggle vigorously and confidently : the entrepreneurial genie is well out of the bottle in today 's China , a nation open for business at both the corporate and the street-hawker level . In fact , this city has always had a throbbing business heartbeat , with few cultural treasures to equal the Great Wall or the terra-cotta warriors . The Shanghai Museum ( 201 Renmin Boulevard ) does compensate somewhat with its 120,000 fabulous artifacts , including bronzes , ceramics , calligraphy and paintings . There is also a smattering of other notable sights , such as the Yu Garden ( 132 Anren Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its stone carvings , and the Jade Buddha Temple ( 170 Anyuan Road ) , with its six-foottall statue of Buddha carved from a single piece of jade . But Shanghai is essentially a city that wants to hurtle forward , not glance backward , to be a major international player on a par with Hong Kong , Tokyo , New York and London . This wo n't happen as quickly as the Shanghainese think , but the rest of the world had better take notice . Now is the time to go and take a peek into the future . " There is constant change in the city , " says Mark DeCocinis , a Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company regional vice president , who used to manage its Shanghai property , the Portman ( 1376 Nanjing West Road ; 011-86-21-6279-8888 ; ritzcarlton.com ) , one of the city 's most popular international hotels , where both Bill Clinton and George W. Bush have stayed . " If I do n't go to one area of the city for a while on my morning runs , I can guarantee that the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It is happening before your very eyes .
