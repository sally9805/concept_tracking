Michael Moore 's War <P> Moore 's movie may be a mix of fact and fiction , but anything that opens up discussion on the invasion of Iraq is good for America . JOHN MIRANDA Oro Valley , Ariz . <P> Michael Moore 's film Fahrenheit 9/11 is not just the politics of entertainment or the entertainment of politics July 12 . For those who have been assimilating information and connecting the dots since George W. Bush took office , Moore simply lays it all out  --  the whole picture  --  which is something that our main media have been too gutless to do . Nothing Moore points out is a surprise . Everything he presents in this film should make an American citizen angry . Those who are shocked by Moore 's documentary have not been paying attention to current events and what they are signaling loud and clear . LIZ ROSE Santa Cruz , Calif . <P> Because Moore is too old to spank , he deserves a good slap in the face . He 's like a spoiled child who runs around saying outrageous things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't cute ; he 's dangerous . To imply that 9/11 could have been prevented is ludicrous . Moore 's anti-American rhetorical bomb throwing should not go unanswered . JOSEPH CALVINI SR . Mamaroneck , N.Y . <P> Critics are willing to apply a stricter standard to Moore 's presentation of his opinions than they do to Bush 's argument for his . That 's why Moore 's movie is necessary . Those who desired a serious debate in the lead-up to the Iraq war waited in frustration for serious journalists to ask hard questions and apply critical scrutiny to the Administration 's case . Moore 's questions are the ones that should have been debated before we went into Iraq . Why should Moore 's movie receive closer scrutiny than the Administration 's decision to go to war ? S. ANN ROBINSON Ashburn , Va . <P> Fahrenheit 9/11 is not a documentary film ; it is history 's longest and most maliciously negative campaign ad . The filmmaker raises the art of innuendo and guilt by association to heights unimagined even by Senator Joseph McCarthy . RICHARD A. STACY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very truth-twisting tactics that he decries , proving that you can fool some of the people some of the time by pushing all the right buttons . Moore so deftly exploits class envy , ignorance , emotionalism , gullibility and victimhood that Fahrenheit 9/11 might just as well have been called Marketing 101 . ROSALIE GRAHAM SZILAGYI Louisville , Ky . <P> Just what we need : an arrogant loudmouth who represents a loony , paranoid faction . But it 's not Rush Limbaugh . Surprise ! It 's Michael Moore ! HEIDI CRABTREE Kennesaw , Ga . <P> What is all the silliness in response to the long-overdue anti-Republican propaganda in Fahrenheit 9/11 ? Fox News unabashedly spews anti-Democratic invective daily , so why the deep concern about one movie ? Right-wingers dish it out with impunity , but they are certainly whining about Moore 's response . The world beyond U.S. borders recognizes the transparent absurdity of this redneck posturing . At least half of all Americans undoubtedly cringe at the loss of respect and dignity the U.S. suffers on the global stage because of the embarrassingly blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a thorn in Bush 's side , but around the world the filmmaker 's brand of honesty redeems the credibility of the U.S. JIM MARTENS Vernon , B.C.
