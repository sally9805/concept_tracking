Tires crunch against the crushed stone driveway , and a flash of headlights crosses Kent 's bedroom window , waking him from a light sleep . But he was n't asleep , he tells himself . Merely resting , eyes closed . Listening . Just as , when Rose was still in high school , he lay in bed after midnight and listened for the sound of a car  --  his , or the current boyfriend 's , her girlfriend 's father 's car , sometimes even his ex-wife 's car  --  bringing Rose home to his house , where she spent the weekend , Kent 's every-otherweekend , or her spring-break week , or her two-week midsummer visit . In his house in his town , his turn to be the custodial parent . <p> Quality time , they called it . He would greet her at the door and make sure she was n't drunk or high or sad , and when she was suffering from any of those conditions , he tried to treat her condition rationally , calmly , realistically . Kent was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and also a man of the world . He knew what kids were dealing with out there . He sympathized . Even today , a decade later and more of an administrator now than a physician , Kent still sympathizes . <p> He hears the thump of Rose 's clunky Doc Martens against the front deck , the jingle of the house key , and the slammed door . In three months Rose will be thirty , and she still slams the door when she comes in , no matter how late the hour . And Kent still checks the car for scratches and dents the morning after she borrows it . Especially this car , his brand-new Audi 3000 , silver and sleek  --  his sixtieth birthday present to himself . He 's already reminding himself to examine the car in the morning before he leaves for the office , so he wo n't discover the ding in the fender or the broken taillight late in the afternoon in the clinic parking lot , which is where she 'll insist it must have happened , since she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'll accept that . He 'll have to . He turns on the bedside lamp , gets out of bed , and walks to the closet . But she 'll be lying . Or worse , she wo n't really know one way or the other how it happened , and wo n't care , either . He pulls his bathrobe over his pajamas and pads barefoot down the hall to the kitchen . <p> " Hey , babe . Nice time ? " he says and plucks a bunch of purple grapes from the fruit bowl on the breakfast table . She 's sprawled at the table , thoughtfully drinking milk from a half-gallon container . Kent likes this kitchen , the only truly up-to-date , architect-designed room in the house . It 's an orderly arrangement of stainless steel , ceramic tile , overhead pot-racks , and butcher-block islands . He had it renovated top to bottom back when he first got serious about gourmet cooking and enjoys telling people that the kitchen is state of the art . The rest of the house is more or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , the year after the divorce . Since then , though he 's enjoyed several long-term romances with women , good women his own age , marriageable women , he 's not shared his house with anyone  --  except his daughter . Has n't wanted to . A nineteenfifties , mid-level mafia capo 's suburban ranch , is how Kent likes to describe the house to strangers . <p> He pops the grapes one by one into his mouth . He 's been unmarried now for nearly as long as he was married , and the fact freshly surprises him . He drops the grape stem into the trash compactor . <p> " I wish you 'd use a glass , " he says evenly . Julia , his ex-wife , gave her that habit  --  drinking orange juice , milk , whatever , straight from the carton . <p> " Sorry , Pops , I forgot . It 's been a while , " Rose says . She shrugs and smiles up at him , sheepishly , or maybe mockingly , he 's not sure which . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has it ? Barely half a year . <p> She stands and crosses to the glassware cabinet , where she takes out a tumbler and fills it , leaving the carton on the counter . Rose is a tall , large-boned woman with burgundy-colored , shoulder-length hair . Her skin comes from her mother-skin so smooth and strikingly pale it seems washed in a hazy-blue light . When Julia was Rose 's age , he remembers , she tied her hair back the same way and in summer favored sleeveless , V-neck blouses . Julia then , like her daughter now , showed as much face , throat , and arms as possible . If you 've got it , she used to say , show it . <p> Kent does n't know how Julia does her hair now or if her skin is still as beautiful  --  he has n't seen her close-up in over seven years . He imagines that she 's changed in that time as much as he and in most of the same ways . In seven years your whole body replaces itself , cell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and returns it to the refrigerator . " So how was it tonight , with your old pals ? " <p> " Okay , " she says . " It was fun . " Then , " Not , actually . Not okay . Not fun . " " Oh ? Why ? " <p> " Eddie and Jeanette and Tucker and Sandy ? They 're not my old pals . Not really . And they 're married , they 're couples , et cetera . And they 're definitely on the boring side . Tep-id . " <p> " They are ? " he says in a low , sad voice . He wants to let his disappointment show without having to say it . <p> " Yeah . I did n't even know them , you know , till after the divorce . I mean , I knew them , we hung out a lot when we were teenagers , but it was mostly summers , Dad . A few weeks at a time . " <p> He understands . It has to be hard for her , five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every six months or so for a long weekend or maybe a week . Then being alone with him at his house ( her house once , as he often points out , but , as she insists , not hers anymore ) , until he fears he 's holding her against her will , so he starts pushing her to go out on her own , go ahead , borrow the Audi , visit some of her old pals . Most of the local people her age , because they 've not left this small , upstate town for more promising climes , have married one another and have settled for much less than Rose wants for herself . She 's right . They are boring . <p> Rose is an artist , a sculptor who has already had two one-person shows of her work , the first at Skidmore in Saratoga Springs , where she went to college , and the other at a small gallery in Litchfield , Connecticut , where Julia lives . Julia and her second husband , Thatcher Clarke , the executive director of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When Julia first met Thatcher , a few months before her divorce from Kent became final , he was the director of the Adirondack Arts Council and had already been hired to run the clock and watch museum down in Litchfield , one hundred twenty miles to the south . Within weeks of the divorce , Julia followed him there . Rose went with her . Because of the schools . That 's when the need for quality time arrived . <p> Kent honestly believes that Ol ' Thatch , as he calls him , is perfect for Julia , and he 's been a good stepfather for Rose . He 's a hale fellow well-met , in Kent 's words , and a liberal New England Republican . Kent , on the other hand , is proud to be neither . He spoke with Ol ' Thatch briefly at Rose 's high school graduation , renewed their slight acquaintance when she graduated from Skidmore , and saw him a third time last fall at the Skidmore show . <p> Julia did n't attend the opening . She was at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she okay ? Health-wise ? " Oh , sure , " Rose assured him . " It 's about weight . As usual . " Julia had mailed the spa her fifteen-hundred-dollar deposit months earlier and did n't want to lose it , so Rose told her to go , for heaven 's sake . She could see Rose 's new work on her own anytime . Two months later , Rose had the show in Litchfield . <p> Rose kisses her father on the cheek , says goodnight , and saunters down the hall toward her room , flipping off lights as she goes . Her bedroom is situated on the opposite end of the house from Kent 's master bedroom . It was originally meant to be guest quarters , but the first weekend Rose spent with him in his new house , when she was fifteen , Kent turned the guest bedroom , dressing room , and bath over to her . He did it casually , as if it were something that occurred to him only when it was happening , but it was long-planned and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to feel like a father , a real father with a house large enough to give his teenaged daughter her own bedroom suite , where she could play her music and watch TV and talk on her own phone without interfering with his music , TV , and phone . He was no longer a middle-aged single guy subletting a semi-furnished garden apartment in a complex filled with young professionals . He 'd hated that . He was a proper family man now . His house , his daughter 's rooms , and her regular , ongoing presence at his house proved it . <p> He needed that visible evidence of paternity , and he believed that Rose did , too . The divorce was harder on her , he feels , than either Julia or Rose herself is willing to acknowledge  --  Julia because she still feels guilty for the several , careless little love affairs that led up to the divorce and ostensibly caused it , and , too , because she was the one who afterwards moved away ; and Rose because she does n't want her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> It was n't Julia 's dalliances , though , that caused the divorce , or her removal to Litchfield that heightened the pain of it for Rose . And Kent knows it . As the years pass , some things in life do get simpler , and Kent 's divorce from Julia was becoming one of those things . No , it all came down to the simple fact that he grew up , and she did n't , and then would n't . And because she had plenty of inherited money , she 's never had to . She did n't need Kent 's money or proximity to raise their child , she could do it on her own , and mostly , that 's what she did . There 's no way , of course , that he can tell this to Rose or Julia . Not now . They 'd think he was criticizing them , and he was n't . <p> Kent washes Rose 's milk glass in the sink , places it into the dish rack , and switches off the overhead light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he ca n't remember if he locked the door to the backyard . The flagstone floor is cold against his bare feet , when suddenly it 's as if he 's walking on gravel or broken peanut shells . Popcorn , maybe . Beads from a broken necklace ? He gropes beside him in the dark , until his hand finds a floor lamp . <p> It 's birdseed ! A wide trail of sunflower and wildflower seeds and cracked corn spills from the pantry behind him , where he stores a hundredpound bag of mixed birdseed in a large galvanized trash can . The trail crosses the porch to the door leading outside . Mornings over his second cup of coffee and evenings over his first scotch and soda , Kent often sits out here on the glider and watches the birds flutter greedily over the three large birdfeeders hanging from the maple tree . There are finches , both purple and gold , pine siskins and grosbeaks , cardinals and phoebes . Once he saw an indigo bunting and was so excited he shouted , " Look ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the glass , scared the bunting , and it flew away and did n't return . <p> He stares down at the birdseed scattered over the slate floor , and he feels his neck and ears redden . She must have refilled the feeders sometime earlier tonight , and instead of bringing the feeders into the pantry and filling them there , which is how he does it and has demonstrated for her any number of times , she carried the seeds , scoop by scoop , across the porch and out the door , spilling as she went . That 's so damned typical ! And , of course , since she never sees disorder anyway and did n't see the stuff scattered across the floors of the porch and pantry , she did n't think to clean it up . Never crossed her mind . He strides down the hall to Rose 's end of the house , snapping on lights as he goes . <p> He knocks firmly on her door . Not with anger , for while he is exasperated , he 's not angry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all these years , he still does n't understand why she ca n't or wo n't remember what he tells her to do , what he asks her to do , what he wants her to do , when she 's in his house . When she 's in his life , for heaven 's sake . She acts as if , for her , his life does n't exist , or if it exists at all , it does n't have any meaning . He ca n't bear that . <p> She opens the door . She 's wearing green and blue plaid flannel pajamas and has her toothbrush and toothpaste in hand . " You have n't gone to sleep yet , have you ? " he asks evenly . <p> " I have n't made my evening ablutions yet , " she says smiling . Then she sees his expression . " What 's the matter ? " <p> " The birdseed , Rose . You spilled it all over the porch floor . " <p> She wrinkles her brow and stares at her father 's face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did ? " <p> " Yes . " <p> " Sorry . I ... I was n't aware ... , " she trails off . " The birdfeeders were almost empty . You want me to clean it up ... now ? " <p> " If you do n't mind . " <p> She sighs audibly . " O-kay . " <p> Kent turns and walks purposefully back to his side of the house , not stopping until he 's inside his bedroom and has closed the door , extinguished the light , and has got himself under the covers in bed . He 's breathing rapidly , as if he 's just climbed three flights of stairs . His heart is pounding , and adrenaline is rushing through his body . He knows what 's happening to his body , he 's a doctor , after all . But why is it happening ? Why is he fuming over such a trivial offense ? Why even view it as an offense in the first place ? Must he take personally everything his daughter does wrong ? <p> In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There are no dents or scratches on his Audi . He feels guilty for last night , not because he did or said anything to hurt her , but because he was angry , when clearly something else was called for . He 's not sure what , but he knows that anger was useless to them both . Useless and therefore offensive somehow . Around ten , he telephones the house , and she picks up . " I wondered if you 'd like to meet me for lunch downtown , " he says , a little shy and stiff . <p> " Sounds great ! " She 's chewing food , he can tell , and is probably still in bed in her pajamas , flopped in front of the TV , working her way through the lox and bagels he bought especially for her visit . <p> " Want me to come by the house and pick you up ? " <p> " No , I 'll ride the bike ! It 's gorgeous out , and I need the exercise . I 've been a lump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his office at one . At a quarter to one , Kent walks out the door of the clinic , leans against the railing of the front steps , and looks along the street uphill to his right , where he knows that Rose in a few moments will come into view pedaling her old bike , the blue Raleigh three-speed that he bought for her the summer she turned fourteen . She already owned a bike , a present on her twelfth birthday from both Mom and Dad , but he bought her the Raleigh himself so that , after the divorce , she could ride from her mother 's house to his whenever she wanted , he told her . Then Julia moved . Or from his house to the office , he assured her , where they could meet for lunch on Saturdays when he had to work . She rode from his house on Ash Street to Main and then cruised ten blocks along Main to the long , curving hill that flattened and straightened where it passed in front of the clinic . He remembers October @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sky was deep blue . He liked to wait on the steps outside , just as he is doing today , and every time he saw her pedal around that far curve with a wide , excited grin on her face and her auburn hair flying behind her in the rippling sunlight , his chest filled with joy and with an inescapable sadness , and he could barely keep his eyes from flooding with tears . He knew what gave him the joy  --  she did ; he loved her , and the joy proved it  --  but he did not know what caused the sadness . <p> Here she comes now , a beautiful young woman in jeans and mint-green sleeveless T-shirt , wearing sunglasses , and smiling broadly at the sight of her father . He stands on the clinic steps with arms folded , still a hundred yards away from her , and she lifts her right hand high in the air and waves . <p> He waves back , smiles , and feels his chest tighten and buckle with emotion . He has never felt as proud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's the simplicity of her beauty and her sincerity , he decides . That 's what makes him proud of her . They are qualities of body and character , qualities of self , that for unknown reasons have been invisible to him until this moment . He does n't ask why he never saw them before . Instead , he wonders why they should have suddenly become visible . <p> Because she is at hand , yet still far away , is his answer . But coming nearer by the second , and nearer , when suddenly , to avoid hitting something on the road that he ca n't see , a piece of broken glass , perhaps , she swerves the bike out into the middle of the street and puts herself between an oncoming UPS truck and a Volvo station wagon bearing down behind her . Kent reaches toward her with both arms , his mouth wide open as if to shout , but he ca n't break his silence , he ca n't even say her name , and she swerves a second time , this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street onto a narrow lane on the opposite side , where she disappears . <p> The UPS truck passes Kent nonchalantly , as if the driver has noticed nothing out of the way , as if he 's not seen anyone in danger for a very long time , and the Volvo station wagon passes in the other direction as normally as cars have passed all day , the woman driver chatting with the passenger , her husband , perhaps , or a client to whom she 's about to show a house . Then , on his right and across the street , Rose emerges from behind a high hedge on the corner of Main , pedaling her blue Raleigh with ease and obvious pleasure . She 's still smiling and is close enough now to call to him and be heard , " Hey , Dad ! What a day , huh ? " <p> Kent rushes across the street and grabs her bicycle by the handlebars and stops it dead . Rose 's face drops and tightens . Her father is panting , red-faced , sweating . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she asks , her voice rising in fear . " Are you okay ? " <p> " Why ? Why do you do this to me ? To yourself ! Why do you do it to yourself ? " <p> Rose lets go of the handlebars . She reaches forward and places her hands on her father 's shoulders , as if she is the parent and he the reckless child . " Dad , " she says . " Stop . " <p> " Why ? " <p> Then , calmly , patiently , with a detachment that 's incomprehensible to him , she explains . " I do it because what you do is violent , and it makes me violent , too . That 's why . " The two of them stand there with the blue bicycle between them , traffic whizzing by in the background . <p> " What ? It 's my fault ? " <p> She sighs , and then she tells her father what he needs most to know , but has always seemed incapable of knowing : that his loving kindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him to reject her  --  because of her sloppiness , her carelessness , her disorder . She reminds him of last night 's confrontation over the spilled birdseed . She tells him that he should have let it go till morning . " I 'm twenty-nine , Dad . Leave me a note . I 'd have cleaned it up this morning . " He spoiled their earlier moment in the kitchen , she says , which , if he had left her alone , would have helped her deal with her little failure later in a useful way . " In a way that would n't have scared you . You do n't know , but it 's what I 've been doing for years , " she says . <p> " What have you been doing for years ? " <p> " Things that would scare you , Dad . Only this time you saw it . " <p> Side by side , they walk along the sidewalk , uphill away from the office . Rose keeps one hand on the handlebars , steering the bike , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not angry at you , " she says , sounding distant and almost scientific . " Not anymore . " She understands his needs . Her needs , however , are different , and it 's her mother , she says , who 's shaped her needs . Not him . <p> " Your mother ? " <p> " Dad , Mom is like my hollow double , " she says . " My absent self . Not you . You 're my father . " All these years he 's treated her as if she were like him , she explains , instead of like her mother . And consequently he 's dealt with her as if she had his needs instead of her mother 's . Rose smiles at him , but from a great height . <p> It 's only a flash of awareness , as if a darkened room were lit for a second and then dropped into darkness again , but Kent sees how vain and cruel he 's been . He sees that he 's been a man completely opposed to the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost her mother fifteen years earlier , he has lost Rose now , and for the same reason . He knows nothing of his daughter 's needs , because he knew nothing of her mother 's . <p> He says to Rose , as they turn off Main Street onto Ash , " Was I wrong , to divorce your mother ? To leave you ? " <p> " No , " she says . " You were n't . But you should n't have tried to keep her through me . And me through her , " she says . " Now you 've lost us both . " <p> " You 'll never come to visit me again , will you ? " <p> She shakes her head no . " I 'm sorry . I think this has been the end of everything between us . But we 'll see . " She tells him to go on back to his office . She 'll leave the bicycle in the garage and call a cab to take her to the Trailways station . <p> He stops , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
