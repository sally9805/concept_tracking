<p> Comer <p> Don Mosley exchanged the promise of riches for a life of service below the poverty line . <p> His interpretation of Christianity has sent him to Iraq , to deliver medicine to children in defiance of federal law , and to prison , for failing to pay taxes he believed would be used to blow people up in Nicaragua . Faith also directed him to build houses for the poor in countries that include Egypt , Jordan and Lebanon , in hopes of bringing together Muslims and Christians and reducing the appeal of militant Islam , and to bury executed prisoners near his home in northeast Georgia . <p> Mosley 's beliefs also compelled him to give away an inheritance of nearly $1 million . <p> For the past 24 years , religious conviction has inspired him and a small band of like-minded Christians to welcome 2,500 refugees at a smattering of wooden cabins on 260 acres of piney woods and still lakes near Athens .

It 's about " justice and peace and loving your enemy and returning good for evil , " he said . <p> Mosley , one of the pioneers of Habitat for Humanity , figures he 's given at least 2,000 speeches in the past 20 years about U.S. policy in Nicaragua and Iraq , the plight of refugees and the Christian commandments to act on faith . He also has raised money that provided artificial limbs to thousands of victims on both sides of a civil war in Nicaragua . <p> He said his father , a millionaire businessman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and join him in the " real world .

Mosley 's dad did so well in business that he moved the family into a 26-room house with one of the first private swimming pools in Waco . <p> In his teens , a church mission trip to Central America whetted Mosley 's appetite for adventure . The exotic also beckoned from travel books he kept in a cardboard box in his closet and from brochures he requested from foreign embassies in Washington .

" Then you need to get serious about the family business . " <p> Mosley biked around Europe on a tour that also took him to the Middle East . He remembers being moved by the suffering of Palestinian refugees , but the turning point came in Egypt . <p> There Mosley visited an orphanage run for 50 years by a North Carolina nun named Lillian Trasher . Up to that point , he said , he had been accustomed to a fire-and-brimstone brand of Christianity where people seemed obsessed only with getting to heaven . Some church leaders in Texas suddenly struck him as nationalistic , he said , even racist . <p> " I met a kind of Christian I did n't know existed , " he said . <p> Drawn to Peace Corps <p> Much to his father 's dismay , Mosley put off joining the family business , signing on with the Peace Corps instead and spending several years in Malaysia and South Korea . When he returned , he worked at his father 's company , married Carolyn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and history at Baylor University and a master 's degree in anthropology at the University of Texas . <p> For years he tried to balance his father 's expectations for him to take over the business with his impulse to see the world and help those in need . Finally , Mosley told his dad he was leaving the company . <p> " It almost killed him , " he said . <p> Mosley and his wife lived at a Christian commune in South Georgia called Koinonia Partners . It built low-cost housing for the poor and promoted racial equality while fending off attacks from the Ku Klux Klan . Mosley was there in the mid-1970s when Millard Fuller , who also lived at Koinonia , founded Habitat for Humanity . Mosley spent a month in Zaire with Fuller and his wife , who spent three years in the country , refining a formula Habitat would replicate around the world . <p> Jubilee gets a mission <p> In 1979 , Mosley and others from Koinonia borrowed $140,000 to buy land near Comer .

It inspired him to turn Jubilee into a refugee welcome center . Mosley and his colleagues have since welcomed refugees from countries that include Cuba , El Salvador , Ethiopia , Honduras , Liberia , Mauritania , Sierra Leone , the former Soviet Union , Syria and Vietnam . <p> Mosley said Jubilee accepts refugees without regard to religion and does not interfere with those who worship other faiths . He said hearing refugees ' stories of escaping war and chaos reminds him of comforts he might otherwise take for granted . <p> " Refugees give us more than we give them , " he said . <p> The center relies on donations that often arrive as checks for $50 or $100 .

Growing up , Mosley 's children occasionally longed for a middle-class , suburban life , Carolyn Mosley said , especially when they could n't follow discussions at school about popular TV shows . <p> Their son , Tony , 35 , is a speech pathologist in Knoxville . Daughter Robyn , 31 , works with the mentally disabled in Mobile . <p> Civil disobedience <p> In the 1980s , Mosley became convinced that the United States was wrong to subsidize the Contras , who were fighting the Sandinista regime in Nicaragua .

They also steered hundreds of Central American refugees through Georgia and into Canada , where they received political asylum . <p> Worried also about the arms race , Mosley withheld a percentage of his income taxes for several years in protest of what the United States spent on defense . In 1982 , about five years after his father died and left him a $500,000 inheritance that grew through the years to nearly $1 million , Mosley declined to file a tax return . He donated most of the inheritance , but the Internal Revenue Service required him to pay taxes on a portion that could not be deducted from his income . <p> He spent 40 days in federal prison as a result . <p> In the ' 90s , Mosley turned his attention to Iraq , and sanctions designed to isolate the rogue regime of Saddam Hussein . <p> " They were keeping out everything from pencils to sanitary napkins , for goodness ' sake , " he said . <p> Mosley traveled to Iraq twice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine .
