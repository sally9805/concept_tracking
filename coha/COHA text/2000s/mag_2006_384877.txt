Even when you find your soul mate , maintaining a relationship takes time , patience and commitment . // IN ZOra Neale Hurston 's novel , Their Eyes Were Watching God , the main character , Janie , finds her soul mate in Tea Cake , a younger man she becomes smitten with . After having encountered several Mr. Wrongs , Janie experiences mutual love and respect with Tea Cake , and the book provides us with the hope of rinding " the One " in our own lives . In reality , the notion of finding that one true love , along with other legends surrounding love and relationships , can be tricky , especially if you do n't distinguish fact from fiction .

" Photograph To achieve harmony in a relationship , experts surest that couples communicate with each other and learn good problem-solving skills . // Truth : A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibility that there are several potential suitable mates for each of us diminishes the romanticism of finding that perfect Mr. or Ms. Right . And that may be why many people hold firm to the belief that there is one true love out there for them-somewhere . " It 's possible to have more than one soul mate , " says Audrey B. Chapman , a Washington D.C.-based relationship expert and author of Getting Good Loving . " You can have different soul mates in order to have different experiences and at different levels into your life . " Many self-described romantics agree : " In a cynical 21st century , basic core human values like love and respect are not often articulated as something that should be incorporated into every human being 's behavior , " says Bernard Williams , 55 , a media specialist . " We might see a lot more success in our relationships if we start with those simple basic working tools . As for me , I once had a soul mate and I hope to have another . I believe in love . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ similar to yours . Truth : While it 's helpful to have a lot in common with your significant other , maintaining one 's individuality is important " There are differences even in people who are similar , " says Dr. Bronwen Millet , a licensed clinical psychologist in private practice in Washington , D.C. " You can create whatever type of relationship you want by working together with your significant other . What I 've seen in practice is that couples who are committed , willing and able to step out to do the work , have healthier relationships .... Saying that there are too many differences for the relationship to work is an easy way out . " MYTH #3 Love conquers all in a marriage and relationship . Truth : The concept that love conquers all sounds good in love songs , but you need more than love to sustain a longterm relationship or marriage .

MYTH #4 Each person gives 50-50 in the relationship . Truth : While most of us are taught that we must give equally in a marriage , it rarely happens . " Someone can give 30-70 or 60-40 , " says Chapman . " What matters most is the person who is giving 60 percent is n't resentful of the person who is giving 40 percent . " This especially holds true in today 's society where traditional male and female roles have become debunked . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn just as much money ( or more ) than their partner .

Entering into a new relationship too soon might not give you a chance to work through all of your issues . To be happy in a relationship , you must first be happy with yourself .

I lowever , if you start to become interested in someone who your friend dated while you were both in high school or college and you all are adults now , that 's acceptable and also less likely to seem like a betrayal to your friend . It 's also important to communicate and to set boundaries , which will determine what is acceptable going forward in the relationship , according to Dr. Millet . MYTH #10 All men cheat .. . eventually . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who do n't cheat While a larger percentage of men than women do cheat , according to relationship experts , not all have-or will .

Now for the twist : The number of women cheating has increased-as many as 40 percent of women ( up from 20 percent ) have had affairs . " Today more women are cheating than did during their mothers ' and grandmothers ' ! generations , " says Chapman . " And women are better at it , " she adds . Whether you have already found your soul mate , or are still looking for that special individual , know that any worthwhile relationship requires a mutual commitment , as well as respect and communication .
