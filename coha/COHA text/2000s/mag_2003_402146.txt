WHEN HOLLYWOOD 'S BIGGEST STAR DECIDED TO TAKE A BREAK FROM THE BIZ , WE WONDERED WHY . HERE , THE TRUTH ABOUT HER MARRIAGE , THOSE BABY RUMORS , AND THE SECRET THAT KEEPS HER SMILING . // We know you 've probably found yourself wondering , " What 's up with Julia Roberts ? " You 're not alone . Just two years ago she received an Academy Award and had her famous smile splashed across almost every newspaper and magazine in the country . But now the once-ubiquitous star seems to be missing in action . With the exception of a cameo role in good pal George Clooney 's 2002 directorial debut , Confessions of a Dangerous Mind , and a small part in the 2002 ensemble flick Full Frontal , Julia , 35 , has kept a curiously low profile over the past year . No glitzy Tinseltown shindigs , no red-carpet appearances , and , most notably , no theater-packing romantic comedies . So what has America 's sweetheart been up to ? Well , the romantics of the world ( us included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savoring her first year of married life with new hubby Danny Moder , with whom she exchanged vows July 4 , 2002 , in a secret midnight ceremony on her ranch in New Mexico . But gossips and tabloids claim to know differently . Ever since this year 's Academy Awards , the rumor mill has been grinding out news that the couple are in trouble , and the reason they 've been lying low is that they 're trying to work things out . Clearly Julia , who is famously fickle with her men , appears intent on making her second marriage a top priority . And if that means removing herself from the glare of the limelight , so be it . If there 's one thing we 've learned about Julia , it 's that when she goes for something , she goes for it big . Her motto has always been : " I know who I am and what I want . " Julia in love She says she knows what she wants , but Julia has done her share of surprising America with her romances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ observed , " Julia has always done surprising things . " Which may be one way of describing Julia 's romance with Moder , the 33-year-old son of movie producer Mike Moder ( Crimson Tide , Beverly Hills Cop ) . The oft-told story goes that Julia and Moder met and became friendly on the set of The Mexican in 2000 , at about the same time her nearly four-year relationship with actor Benjamin Bratt was crumbling . Moder , deep into a four-year marriage to makeup artist Vera Steimberg that had recently become unhappy , lent a shoulder for Julia to cry on . At some point romance blossomed , and within six months of meeting Jules , as her friends call her , Moder served his wife with divorce papers . " It was terribly complicated , " Julia recently admitted , but then made clear , " I was born to love and be the wife of this man . " If Julia 's current affair of the heart sounds familiar , it 's probably because you 've heard the story before . Ever since the Pretty Woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a bit like a modern-day version of Elizabeth Taylor 's . The list of former boyfriends and fiances is practically a who 's who of the sexiest men alive : Liam Neeson , Kiefer Sutherland , Daniel Day-Lewis , Dylan McDermott , Jason Patric , and Matthew Perry . The difference : Julia 's been much more hesitant about tying the knot . Her only marriage before Moder was back in 1993 , to country crooner Lyle Lovett . At the time she declared , " I want to have a family , raise kids . " But 21 months later , the pair divorced . Julia had come close to settling down with Bratt , who made no secret of his own desire to marry and have children . The couple were often seen hanging off each other 's perfect physiques at various red-carpet events . We were all surprised when the dazzling duo quietly went their separate ways in the summer of 2001 . It was just two months later that Julia was spotted around Hollywood with Moder . As rumors flew , the couple only became stronger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julia can cast a spell on the opposite sex that is almost impossible to resist . As her close friend director Steven Soderbergh once said : " Julia is the hottest woman on the planet . In fact , the planet orbits around her . " Two 's company Moder is undoubtedly getting a crash course in what life is like living with the highest paid actress in Hollywood ( she earned an astonishing $25 million for Mona Lisa Smile , due out this winter ) . It 's no secret that the cameraman earns a modest living compared to his wife : Friends of the couple , however , say it 's Moder 's low-key , khaki-and-T-shirt lifestyle that endears him to Julia , a transplanted Georgia peach in constant search of the simple life . " I do n't care about money stuff , " she said recently . " My friends tell me that when I get tired or have a few cocktails , I become Ellie Mae Clampett , " confirming her well-known preference for jeans and flip-flops . And while some marriages would suffer , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple . " Danny is astounding , " Julia said . " He is a man among men : unselfish and all-encompassing . " Ever since their wedding under the Taos stars in New Mexico , Julia and Moder have been lying low , splitting their time between three homes . Last fall , in the afterglow of their honeymoon , the couple stayed in Julia 's lower Manhattan apartment during the making of Mona Lisa Smile , part of which was shot in nearby Tarrytown , New York . But more often than not , the two can be seen strolling hand in hand near their $1.2 million bungalow ( a home so un-Hollywood , it is reported , that it 's not even on the beach ) in Venice , California , or walking their many dogs ( at one point they had as many as 11 ) on their 51-acre , $5 million Taos ranch . This is a pair that definitely enjoys the simple pleasures of life . Rather than hang out with their A-list friends in trendy clubs , they prefer sipping soy cappuccinos in local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cycling around Venice , and Julia admits to having an addiction to video games rather than exercise . " I 'm cultivating Xbox . It 's an insidious beast , " she warned . " Do n't pursue it . It will ruin your life ! " They also have close relationships with both their families : The couple recently attended a Moder family reunion , and Julia 's niece , Emma ( a dead ringer for Julia ) , is a frequent visitor at their home . Last April , Venice Beach locals saw the loving couple check out an outdoor arts festival . " They were smiling and seemed happy , " said one neighbor . So what got tongues wagging about a possible split for Julia and Moder ? That famous faux pas that celebrities often make : showing up solo for a major event . For the Academy Awards , Julia made the grave error of not only arriving at the ceremony minus one husband , but she also eschewed the red carpet and stayed mum to the media at the after-party . That was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took off with that , other reports insist the marriage is rock solid . In fact , a family may be in the works . Since their wedding , Julia has declared , " We want to have a family , and we will have a family in due course . " Last fall , rumors that the actress was pregnant started flying during the filming of Mona Lisa Smile , in part because of remarks Moder was said to have made about how he would shoot her at certain angles to disguise her bump if she were pregnant ( he worked on the film as a cameraman ) . But now , a year later , and with Julia apparently still not pregnant , it 's possible that the road to parenthood may be a bit rocky for them . In response to the tabloids reporting on a possible split and other troubles in the couple 's marriage , Moder , who is said to abhor the intense media scrutiny ( which may be why he did n't go to the Academy Awards ) , faced reporters outside the couple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is just fine with our marriage . I 've heard all the rumors ; I 'm aware of them . But it 's not true . We are fine . " Jerry Weintraub , a producer and a friend of Julia 's , who saw the couple at an Academy Awards weekend party , observed : " They did n't look split to me . They were holding hands and they were very affectionate , very close . " And Julia has certainly learned how to ignore the media : " I can deal with the scrutiny now , because I know the comments of a total stranger do n't amount to a hill of beans , " she told a reporter . Hollywood hiatus Obviously Julia is choosing to work less in front of the camera . With the exception of Mona Lisa Smile , which she finished shooting last fall , the only thing on her acting plate right now is Ocean 's 12-the follow-up to the hit Ocean 's 11-which does n't begin shooting until March 2004 . Behind the scenes , however , Julia has parlayed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imprint of Jennifer Lopez 's Maid In Manhattan , which grossed $94 million at the box office . Another sign that her marriage is going strong : Her company , originally called Shoelace Productions , was recently renamed Red Om ( Moder spelled backward ) , perhaps in honor of her new husband . Another way Julia 's filling her film-free time is with charity work . She continues to generously contribute to numerous causes , as she has done for many years . " Well , not to say I 'm Paul Newman , " Julia has joked , " but I certainly have my philanthropic side . " What an under-statement ! Besides the $2 million she earmarked for the victims of the September 11th terrorist attacks , she offered her time and resources to UNICEF and raised money for camps benefiting seriously ill children . She also works tirelessly to raise public awareness about Rett Syndrome ( a disease that claimed the life of a close friend 's daughter ) , and she also donated $50,000 to an elementary school near her Taos home-with the proviso that nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move What comes next for Julia is anyone 's guess . We do know that she voiced the audio version of the wildly popular book The Nanny Diaries-which may indicate she is eager to land the lead role when the film goes into production . But she recently surprised Hollywood insiders when she left her agent , Jeff Berg of ICM , saying she wants to be without representation for now . Whatever her decision in terms of her career , Julia 's mission is clear : She just wants to " do movies that are good , " she said . That optimism spills over into her hopes for her marriage as well . " If I were to cast a wish , " Julia recently pondered , " I would wish that we Danny and I , as a pair , as a team , as a couple , as partners on this planet , would wake up every day with a fair amount of joy and just a little bit of giddiness and would go to sleep with a sense of having been understood . " Always the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's found true love at last . Sidebar WHAT KIND OF MOM WILL JULIA BE ? FiVe reasons why this Pretty Woman will make a great mom . 1 ) SPREADING THE LOVE Julia has always had a soft spot for kids . Over the years she has worked tirelessly and donated huge amounts of time and money to children 's charities , including the International Rett Syndrome Association and UNICEF . She also has helped raise money for the Hole in the Wall Camp , which benefits seriously ill children . 2 ) PRACTICE MAKES PERFECT Everyone knows that the best way to find out if you 're prepared for parenthood is to get a dog . Well , with so many animals in her care ( a pack of dogs and a stable full of horses ) , Julia has proven she 's a nurturer at heart . 3 ) LOOKING TO THE FUTURE Did dreams of offspring move Julia to donate $50,000 to a school near her ranch in New Mexico ? We 'll never know , but what better way to ensure her local schools are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R 's ? 4 ) MATERNAL INSTINCTS Even though Julia had a falling out with her actor brother , Eric , she has remained close to his ex , Kelly Cunningham , and their daughter , Emma , a Julia look-alike . Julia and Emma are extremely affectionate with each other , and Aunt Julia even acted as her guardian on set while Emma made her latest film . 5 ) SHE WANTS THEM ; SHE REALLY WANTS THEM ! It 's no secret that Julia is anxious to start a family . And the best parent is a committed parent . We have no doubt that Julia will be a fabulous mom !
