From ' BETTY HUTTON ' : He was a big man who looked like trouble , even with his glasses . A cruel fact of nature that made Gibbs a prisoner of his own body long before he became an actual one , at Pine River or the various and lesser security county facilities before that . He 'd been back in the world for months now and had few things to show for it , chiefly a girlfriend and a parole officer , neither of whom was able to give Gibbs what he really needed or wanted , and , truth be told , Gibbs himself had n't the clearest idea of what that might be either . " I guess I 'm waiting for opportunity to suggest itself to me , " he 'd explained to his parole bull . " I think it 's one of those **25;208;TOOLONG type situations . " " A birdy , " O'Donoghue echoed , a stick of a man with a third-act sort of look to him . " Now I 've heard it all . I guess a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not thinking a bird is going to actually speak to me , " Gibbs had said . " Unless it 's a parakeet or something . " He was not stupid , though it often seemed the world was telling him otherwise . All he knew about was old things or how to make a thing look old . During his last bit in the can he 'd seen killing , and what struck him about it was how easy it was . Anybody could do it . From the deck of Jolie 's second-story apartment he could glimpse the Atlantic , if he craned his head , perching on tiptoes . It was October of 1975 , the year beginning to die more than just a little , the Jersey shoretown of Barnegat Light wearing theseason like a down-at-the-heels beauty queen , the summer crowds vacating after Labor Day , neon glaze of the arcades finally switched off , revealing a pitted sweep of beach with all the charm and color of dirty concrete , the slack Atlantic crawling ashore , a pocket watch winding down . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ land behind Gibbs , that pulled at him like a fide . He 'd never been farther west than the eastern fringe of Pennsylvania , had never been anywhere . He 'd heard about Montana , though , a place that sounded like everything had n't yet been decided , where there still might be some time left . A cellmate had told him of the chinooks , the southerly winds capable of turning winter into spring in a matter of hours , sometimes a ninety-degree temperature swing , and it had seemed to Gibbs lying in their dank cement crib , it seemed if such a thing as the chinooks was possible , anything was . It was a sandblasted fall morning that he happened on the Chrysler , a rust-scabbed Newport parked along a dead end of bungalows clapped shut for the season , the car blue and about the size of a narwhal , its white vinyl roof gone to peel , a whip antenna for a CB the car no longer owned . It looked like the beginning to a thought that Gibbs could n't see his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car , two things came to mind . That Jolie had been hiding her squirrel 's stash of mad money in a coffee can on a high kitchen shelf . And the practical knowledge gleaned from his time at the wall of how to jack an automobile , which indeed proved easy enough , a matter of popping the door , taking a screwdriver to the steering column , touching off the appropriate wires , and then , like some low-grade miracle , the car rattling awake , exhaling an extravagant tail of blue smoke . That was how it started : with two wrongs . After a lifetime of wrongs , what were two more ? Nothing , Gibbs told himself , nothing . It was just possible he 'd finally stumbled on the two wrongs that actually might produce a right . He did n't take much with him : a leather satchel swollen with a few changes of clothes , his shaving kit , sundry effects ; a paper sack of sham works : jades and Roman carnelians and openwork medallions ; and , shoved between both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handed down in his family , more a piece of history than an actual piece , the only article of legitimate value among the lot . Out the back window , Barnegat Light framed like a diminishing postcard . That was where trouble would come from when it did , from behind . He tugged on the rearview mirror , yanked it free from its mooring , and then there was only the gray road ahead . A tattered map inside the Chrysler 's glove box ran as far as Harrisburg . After that , Gibbs imagined himself , past the banks of the Susquehanna , falling out the other side of the country , running free , into territory unbound by state lines or the iron sway of laws . He drove clear around the circle of hours , until all the license plates on the road read Wisconsin . Gibbs pulled off to refuel , him running on flames as much as the car . A gas jockey shaped like a butterball stepped out of the office and Gibbs stood to stretch his legs , to take measure on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horizon . At the far corner of the lot , tethered to a pole , was the strangest animal he 'd ever seen , looked like he did n't know what , devil eyes set high on its head . Gibbs said , " What kind of dog is that ? " " It 's a goat , " the gas jockey told him . Gibbs nodded heavily . " I did n't think it was a dog . " " Michigan , " the jockey said and it took Gibbs a few beats to catch his meaning and then he remembered swapping plates the evening before at a reststop outside Franklin , Pennsylvania , with a listing Travelall bearing Michigan tags . " Yeah , the Lions and Tigers . Motor City . " The jockey asked what he wanted , could n't have been any more than seventeen , all pimples and baby fat . Over his heart : Hank stitched in script . Gibbs glanced around for anybody else and there was no one . Back at Pine River , a whole class of inmate specialized in burgling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do I want , " Gibbs laughed . " Well , Hank , I want it all . " " I meant gas . " " Right . Good man . Fill it with regular . Knock yourself out . Hank propped the hood . On the pump , the scratchy spinning of the gallon dial . The roll of money that Gibbs had filched from Jolie bulged the pocket of his trousers , the size of a baby 's fist . He sized up the goat as it grazed leggy plants in a flower box . And then a strange thing . It was as if the person who was Gibbs vanished altogether and he could see the entire scene like it was in front of him , a big man standing in the filling bay , a teenager under the hood of a car wiping the dipstick with a rag , the numbing horizontal of land on all sides . And he watched to see what the big man would do , waiting for the squeal of the hood 's hinges as it dropped , the blackjack crunch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , laying him out on the oil-splotched concrete , peaceful as an afternoon nap . It was the pump boy 's hand reaching over the lip of the hood that brought Gibbs back to the there and then , the hood gently closing , Hank leaning on it till the catch held fast . Gibbs stared off at a windbreak of buckeye chestnuts , his heart throttling , the dry rattle of the few leaves still on the branches . Hank pulled a part from a pocket , massaged it with a rag as if trying to screw it into his palm . " You 're missing a rearview mirror , you know . " Gibbs said , " I 've seen enough of what 's behind me . " Nothing left to do but pay . He was spooked yet . Hank appeared none the wiser , doling out change slowly , making sure to get it right . Gibbs folded himself into the Chrysler . In a few moments he 'd be back on his way . For the time being , though , all he was was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out the filling bay , he rolled down the window . " It 's a funny world , Hank , " he said , pointing at the goat . " Things are n't always what they seem . You know the one about wooden nickels , do n't you ? " " Yes sir . " " Good man . " TWO DAYS LATER and it was Montana . Thus far it was n't entirely what Gibbs had expected . The sky was indeed big and everywhere . But Hokanson , his cellmate from Pine River , had mentioned mountains . He 'd told about mining , too , the strikes of gold and silver . " An occupation , " Hokanson had promised , " where nothing 's required other than doggedness and luck . " Gibbs had liked the sound of that . For a distance of miles the road banded the tracks of the Great Northern and he raced a train with a string of cars long enough almost to be considered geography . There were no posted speed limits , so Gibbs could open the Chrysler up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the state , through flat prairie grasslands and fields already disked for winter wheat , through one-horse towns so small they hardly rated as towns at all , a grain elevator at the outskirts , then a short business strip , usually a grange hall and a church or two and a cross-hatching of streets off the main , the neat rows of side-gabled houses at the edge of the frontier . It was not until after Devon had spread across the front windshield and out the back , after Ethridge and Cut Bank had come and gone , not until Blackfoot that he saw the mountains . They rose before him , out of the west and yellowed plain like a wave , and Gibbs drove toward them , his anticipation gathering like a wave itself . He made Glacier as the sun was emptying from the sky . The calendar still said October though it felt later than that now , the mountaintops webbed in snow , switchbacked roads cut high onto the white shoulders , as if with pinking shears . A different world from the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was late enough in both the day and season that the guard at the gate to Glacier just waved him through , and Gibbs wheeled the Chrysler down a park road lined with the tall green of Engelmann spruce and Doug fir , pulling up at a lake a couple miles on . It was lovelyhe had no other words to match up with the landscapeonly lovely and cold . The lake looked even colder yet and it stretched out before him glassy as a marble , the smudge of twilight already descending , the surround of mountains holding a few clouds within their spires like a cage . A solitary bird flew low over the water , the lake reflecting sky and bird so that it looked like two birds on the wing . Off in the distance , he could see the road following the contours of the shore . In the foreground : a beach of fine pebbles , a woman and a little kid seated at water 's edge . Gibbs could n't remember his last real conversation that had n't concerned gas or lodging , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted right now was to share the moment with someone , an exchange of pleasantries that he associated with regular life . He skimmed through what he had to say for himself . So many places and things in the last few days , the mad rush out , but all the hours and miles of driving bled in a dreamy smear now . The kid did n't look more than a year and change , just a tyke scooping handfuls of stones , flinging them into the shallows with both arms , exclaiming a pleased trill of gibberish with each throw . " He has all the earmarks of a major leaguer , " Gibbs said , coming up from behind . The woman started as if a gun had been fired over her shoulder . Gibbs smiled at her as harmlessly as he could , showing his impossible teeth , wideset as tombstones in a cemetery . " Just look at him , " he said softer , indicating the boy , " throwing with either arm , swinging from both sides of the windmill . " The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ block the last light , like an explorer gazing off into a great distance . Her surprise resettled into a pleasant face , her hair not blond or red but falling somewhere in between , the kid 's coloring pretty much the same and it suited them both . Gibbs figured she was younger than him , though not by a lot , a bit late for family rearing . That was how it was done these days , sometimes not even a man in the picture , which could have been the case here . " I never know what to call them at that age , " he said . " Babies or toddlers . " " Elliot , " the woman said and smiled herself . The kid held up another handful of rocks . Gibbs winked and the boy tossed them , pockmarking the skin of water . " A handsome little man , " Gibbs told her . " A crackerjack . I 'm sure you get tired of hearing that . " " Oh , I do n't think so , " the woman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' Gibbs said . He liked her smile , how it closed the space between them , held nothing back , no room for anything but it . It made him feel more than who he was . A diving platform a hundred yards off bobbed and slapped at the water , the far rim of the lake now more an idea than a physical thing . " They say you can see two hundred miles " the woman said . " On a clear day . That 's hard to believe . " " That 's something , " Gibbs agreed . " Two hundred miles . " " I read it in a brochure . " " Well , then it must be true . " In rapid strokes the day dimmed , clouds blacking out , pinprick of stars here and there . The wind kicked up a chop on the lake , like pulled stitching . Gibbs watched the woman button the kid against the evening chill , the coat ill-fitting , perhaps a hand-me-down or from the church donation bin . The kid squirmed worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanting only the rocks . The woman persisted as if nothing was more important than this , than making sure the kid was warm , her face tired yet burnished with devotion , a face that said to Gibbs that things might not have been the easiest but if she got this simple task right , then maybe life might tell a different story for the boy , a hope that attached to her like a shine . Gibbs felt he was spying on them . He drifted back to the car , sat behind the big circle of steering wheel . In the dark , the woman 's face stayed with him . A raven flapped over the windshield , like a hinged W ; across the way , twin pearls of headlights throwing cables into the black . Gibbs would have bet down to the green felt of the table that the boy was an accident , all she had to show for bad times and worse memories . There was still her hope , so much it seemed to extend to Gibbs as well . She could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daily papers full of accounts of what could happen to a woman and a child alone in the night . A face that held that much trustGibbs would have stolen another auto , driven another nineteen hundred miles just to look into another such face . He reached for the paper sack on the backseat , withdrew a jade piece he could identify by touch alone , stood out from the car and double-timed back to the lakeshore , fearing the woman and Elliot might have moved on , but they were still there , turning to Gibbs as he approached , as if waiting . He bent to show what was in his hand , told about the fish , which was green and long and slender , fashioned with incised fins and a squared mouth . " From the Shang dynasty , " he said . " It dates back to well over a thousand years before Jesus . Something this ancientin its own way , it 's a lot like seeing two hundred miles , is n't it ? " Gibbs was tempted to hand the jade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because it just might wind up in the drink and gave it to the woman instead . She turned it with a careful finger . " It 's pretty , " she said and it was . In some circles it would n't amount to more than a passable imitation , but it was still pretty ; he 'd even gone to the trouble of filing an edge off one corner of the tail . By his lights , all that should be worth something . " For the boy 's college fund , " Gibbs explained . He 'd not see her after tonight , would never see her again , but maybe they 'd remember him for that . The woman switched her gaze from the jade to him . " How do you like that , bub , " Gibbs said , poking the boy in his tight round of belly . The kid ducked behind the woman , peeked out . " I 'm Claire , " she said . " Gibbs , " he told her . " My name 's Gibbs . " He thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stranger , but she curled her hand around the jade , shook it like dice . She swept her other arm back behind her to bring the boy forward . " Look at this , Elliot , " she said , then studied Gibbs , a face like a question . " Well , we thank you , Mr. Gibbs . " " No , it 's just Gibbs , " he said . " There 's no mister about it . " IT WAS FULL NIGHT when he quit Glacier . The road wound amidst close hills and , high above , points of stars flashed . He had everywhere and nowhere to go . He thought the random thoughts of a man behind the wheel of a car . He considered his kid brother , had n't in the longest time and now he did . Miles was a scientist who researched genes . The last time Gibbs had seen him was the old man 's funeral , before Pine River . After the burial , Miles had talked about his work , the fact of DNA carrying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul practically . Gibbs followed the spiral of explanation the best he could , nodding like a woodpecker , until all the talk of markers sounded only like poker . Miles grew increasingly fidgety and Gibbs had wondered if maybe there was n't something else his brother was trying to tell him . In the end Miles had said maybe it was n't such a good idea for Gibbs to contact him for a while , his forehead crumpling like paper . " It 's just that I have a wife now and there 's the kids , " he said , leaving the thought unfinished , for it to spin in the air between them like flies , " It 's okay , Miles , " Gibbs had assured him . " If I were related to me I would n't want to know me either . No harm , no foul . " As it turned out , it 'd been like mourning two deaths for Gibbs , that of the old man and Miles , too . And he was the only one left . There 'd been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afforded . Hokanson was a nasty piece of work , a transfer from a distant facility out west , his crimes so monstrous that he was remanded thousands of miles back to the tidal flats of Jersey for his own safety . None of the other numbers could say exactly what he 'd done , only talk , but even the hardest cases swung wide of him . Hokanson and Gibbs , though , had got on without incident . After lights-out , he 'd tell Gibbs stories of Montana , that eerie , raspy voice , almost like metal-on-metal , the trail of words leading into the nameless hours . The facility at Pine River was erected on marshy land , hard by the steady rustle of the Atlantic . On nights of particular full moons the water table rose , the floor of their matchbox quarters awash in brine , and on those nights Hokanson 's words were of unique comfort . As long as he talked , that barred world went away , the murmurings down the cellblock row of dangerous men crying and praying and talking in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hokanson had gone , tales of a place big enough that there still might be room for someone like him . HE STAYED THAT NIGHT outside Glacier in a town called Hungry Horse , in an efficiency unit at a motel , a room with mismatched burners on the gas stove and a stale ammonia odor , like a convalescent home . Gibbs suspected he was the only guest for the evening but later heard a car trunk slam and the scrabble of a key finding the lock , then the door to the next room swinging open on creaky hinges . A woman 's throaty voice carried through the shared wall . " You already told me more than I want to know , " it said and then a deeper voice answering , unintelligible , little more than a grunt . Gibbs woke during the middle of the night to a train whistle . A picture came to mind , an old-timey locomotive chug-chugging through the pleats of hill , a plume of smoke mingling with the feathering evergreens , a soothing image . Sleep seemed like another place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the curtained window , the moon , the same moon shining over the shoretown in Jersey he 'd fled although it did n't feel that way . He mulled over what he knew about motels , how they were largely a charge card business these days , whatever cash on hand probably secured in a strongbox . And he could sense the impulses edging in , as familiar and thick as blood , and he tried to think of something else . He thought about the Claire woman from earlier , from the lake , how her hope seemed to flow as easy as instinct , as easy as breathing , a gift . Gibbs would have given almost anything for such hope . Years before , he 'd forsaken drink and at the time it 'd seemed like the hardest thing in the world but he now understood it was n't . A dog barked out on the road and down the way another answered it , back and forth , and he could imagine the chorus being picked up in houses further down the line , the call and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road stretched , and he suddenly felt far away from anything he 'd ever known . Gibbs dropped into sleep , picturing again a locomotive , a mare 's tail of smoke over a steel trestle bridge and a bottomless gorge below , the warm sensation that he was arriving at some destination but was n't quite there yet . FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS , Gibbs was content to stay put , operating without purpose , letting the hours assume their own shape . He had money in his pocket and he put up in motels and ate as if he 'd the key to the king 's larder . He whiled away an afternoon in Kalispell watching planes wing in to the airport . In Whitefish he found a park with a lake that was not as big or majestic as the lake in Glacier , and along the rocky beach , a canoe . Nobody was around and Gibbs paddled out . An overcast day , gray mountains ringing the horizon and merging with sky , the lakeshore vacation homes perched on stilty legs , dark and empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finding anything of value in such places but you never really knewsometimes you got lucky . Gibbs considered the steep A-frames like possibilities , then paddled back . Happy hour : sounds of drinking , lively discussion about if it might snow wafting out of the avenue bars . He walked to the end of town , suppertime in the boxy hall-and-parlor houses . He watched in the dark as he would a TV with the sound off , tried to envision himself inside among them . He used to taunt his prey , in the prickly moments before hands got thrown , used to ask , " Do you know physics ? Do you know what happens when an object comes up against an immovable object ? " To a man they 'd been more chump than victim , would have done the same to him if they could havethat was what he told himself then , what he repeated now . And he watched the cheery scenes on the other side of glass , brothers and sisters passing servings around kitchen tables , Gibbs taking it in like something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
