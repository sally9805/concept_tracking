Headnote Al Gore is building a mass political movement to stop global warming . But can he beat the clock ? AS THE WORLD HEATS UP , SO DOES AL GORE . EVERY MELTING GLACIER , every catastrophic storm , every record-breaking hot spell is a planetary-scale endorsement of his belief that tackling global warming is the biggest challenge of our time . Gore may not have announced his candidacy for president - not yet , anyway - but he is already running one of the most aggressive campaigns in American history . His Oscar-winning documentary , An Inconvenient Truth , brought the harsh facts of the climate crisis to millions of people around the world . He 's in the midst of an intensive tour to promote his new book , The Assault on Reason , which savages the Bush administration for its deceitful war in Iraq , its illegal wiretapping and its reckless refusal to take action on climate change . And he 's gearing up for Live Earth , the global rock concert he has orchestrated for July 7th . Gore understands that confronting the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but a new kind of politics . In a sense , he is following a path blazed by filmmaker Michael Moore , using his own presence and political outrage to focus public attention on a broader cause . In the two years since he wrote " The Time to Act Is Now , " the introduction to the special issue on global warming we published in 2005 , Gore has not only shifted the national debate on planet-warming pollution , he has found his true voice - at once reasoned and impassioned , urgent and optimistic . At the end of May , he sat down with ROLLING STONE in his office in Washington , D.C. , to discuss the threat posed by catastrophic climate change - and why he believes it 's not too late to stop it . The world 's leading climate scientists - the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change - issued a report earlier this year that shows global warming is far more advanced than even the most dire predictions had led us to believe . Is there any one finding from the most recent wave of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scientists are willing to assign to their conclusions has gone up . But what 's more interesting to me than the IPCC report is the stream of evidence just in the last five months since that report . Many scientists are now uncharacteristi ' cally scared . The typical pattern in a dialogue between scientific experts and the general public , of which I 'm a part , is for the scientists to say , " Well , what you 've heard is a little oversimplified . It 's a lot more textured than that , and you need to calm down a little bit . " This situation is exactly the reverse . Those who are most expert in the science are way more concerned than the general public . Why ? For the first time , we can see in the numbers that the rate of increase in global warming is accelerating . One of the studies that has come out since the IPCC report shows that the Arctic ice cap is melting three times faster than the models predicted . And in the Antarctic , near the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ - with temperatures up to forty-one degrees Fahrenheit for an extended period of time . That 's really unexpected . I spent most of a day at the Scripps Institute last week reviewing the evidence with a large group of scientists . The IPCC will typically have projections for three scenarios : low , moderate and severe . Almost all of the new results that are cascading in are hugging the top , severe scenario . Any rational person who immerses himself or herself in this evidence would say , " Oh , my God , we 've got to act immediately and drastically . We have a planetary emergency . " Many climate scientists say , off the record , that they have grave doubts that we 'll be able to slow global warming in time to stave off a planetwide catastrophe . James Lovelock , one of the world 's most esteemed scientists , told us recently that he believes it is already too late to save ourselves by buying Priuses and changing light bulbs - that we need to begin preparing for life on a different planet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're not going to solve this problem by buying Priuses and changing our light bulbs . But driving hybrids and choosing better technology is still important in two respects . First , it makes a small contribution to reducing CO2 . And second , when people make changes in their own lives , they are much more likely to become part of a critical mass of public opinion and to support the bigger policy changes that are going to be needed to really solve the problem . Another part of Lovelock 's analysis I agree with is that some degree of change in the planet 's climate is now clearly unavoidable . Some is already beginning to take place , and a good deal more is programmed into the climate system because of the extra heat stored up in the oceans . That will play out in our lifetimes and beyond . So some degree of adaptation is sensible and necessary . But it 's crucial that we not fool ourselves into thinking that we can adapt to this climate crisis . If we do n't begin to sharply reduce COz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constant reshuffling of the climate deck - rainfall and storms and sea level and soil moisture and diseases and ice melting and all the rest . It would be a different planet from the one on which human beings evolved . So does that mean we need to start figuring out how to terraform Mars ? No . It 's impertinent for me to disagree with such a distinguished scientist about anything in the scientific realm - James Lovelock has forgotten more than I will ever learn . But I think I may know one thing about politics that he does n't know . And that is that the political system shares one thing in common with the climate system : They 're both nonlinear . For those who look at the frustratingly slow pace of change that has characterized the last few decades on this issue , it is tempting to simply extrapolate that pace of change and conclude that we 're not going to get there . But I think that we are closer than ever before to a genuine political tipping point beyond which the pace of change is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pace of changes that climate scientists are seeing , you 're still optimistic ? Look , I will " fess up to the element of " hope being father to the thought " here . But I do n't think it 's an unrealistic hope at all . I believe that it 's much more likely than not that we will see within the next few years a very dramatic political change in most of the world , including in the United States , that will sharply reduce CO2 . We 're on the threshold of the kind of sweeping policy changes that we really need . If I did n't believe that , I would n't be doing what I 'm doing . What do you think will drive that change ? Will it take another planetary ' scale disaster like Hurricane Katrina ? Or do you envision a more organic sort of awakening ? I think it 's a combination of the two . More and more people are taking the time to learn about the science , and they are connecting the dots for themselves . When those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mosques and civic organizations and en ' tire communities all start to focus on the evidence - then even evidence from Mother Nature that falls short of a Katrinascale catastrophe reinforces the message . The heat wave last summer did n't reach the level of Katrina , but it led Pat Robertson to say , " I 've changed my mind , global warming is real , we 've got to sharply reduce fossil-fuel use . " There will be no shortage of statements from Mother Nature . April was the hottest April in the history of Europe . The hottest winter in the world 's history was December , January and February . The hottest year in America 's history was 2006 . There is also a very deep emotional and spiritual component to this tipping point we 're going to cross . The civil rights movement took off in the United States only when it was lifted out of the political framework and placed in a spiritual framework . Young people asked their parents , " You tell me to choose right over wrong , so explain to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the adults could n't answer , that 's when the laws changed . Young people are now asking their parents and grandparents , " Please explain to me why what 's going on with global warming is n't insane . " A lot of adults ca n't answer . The revolution is beginning . But let 's be real about the political obstacles . Public awareness and a growing desire for change are important , but against that you have the oil and coal and automobile industries - entrenched interests that have been able to stave off any sort of meaningful action on global warming for years , including the eight years when you were vice president . Is it realistic to expect that Washington will ever enact the kind of wholesale changes needed to address this crisis ? I concluded a long time ago that the only pathway is through a mass political movement that engenders a sea change in public opinion across the planet . Special interests have way too much power to block progressive change . But their power , as impressive as it is , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , logic , knowledge , evidence - these all may play a diminished role in our conversation of democracy today . But when enough people lock into the same narrative and connect the same dots and feel the danger facing their children , then these objections will be set aside . They will be . And we 're close . We 're not there yet . But we 're close . You have compared the mobilization that would be required to deal with global warming to the way America came together to win the second World War . But that effort required great personal sacrifice on the part of the American people . People did with ' out . They melted their scrap metal , they planted victory gardens . Yet very few politicians are talking about the kinds of sacrifice that will be required to deal with climate change . What will Americans have to give up to stop global warming ? There 's a philosophical question embedded in what you 're asking : Is this important enough for us to make sacrifices ? The answer is yes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization . But in answering that way , I do n't want to convey the faulty impression that most of what needs to be done involves hair-shirt economics or going back to some miserable standard of living . That 's simply not true . Most of the changes we need to make do n't involve sacrifice in the way you are using the word - instead , they require us to overcome inertia and eliminate absurdly wasteful practices . Amory Lovins , the brilliant and respected physicist , was addressing this question in a conversation with me recently . He said , " When it comes to making sacrifices , they 've got the sign wrong . " I 'm thinking , " This guy 's so smart , he must be talking about trigonometry - sines , cosines . " Turns out he was talking about a plus sign and a minus sign . His point was that most of the important changes that have to be made to sharply reduce CO2 actually have a plus sign instead of a minus sign - they represent improvements to our quality of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in traffic jams for an hour and a half every day is not a sacrifice , it 's an enhancement . Changing the assumption that it 's perfectly natural to take 4,000 pounds of metal with us everywhere we go does n't have to be a sacrifice . Whether it 's ultralight , ultrasafe vehicles or plug-in hybrid technology or some better alternative that is still on the drawing boards , let 's have at it . Will there come a time when harder choices or more difficult and painful choices have to be made ? Probably . But the sacrifices associated with not doing it completely overwhelm whatever difficulty might eventually be involved in making this transformation . In your new book , you 're brutal on the Bush administration for how they deceived the country in leading us into war . How does that compare to the way they 've manipulated the climate debate ? It 's the same . In both cases the policy outcome was predetermined , in spite of the voluminous evidence that it would lead to catastrophe . It was known at the time we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do with Osama bin Laden or Al Qaeda . It was known that if we tried to occupy Iraq with a force of less than several hundred thousand troops , the prospects for sectarian violence and disintegration of the nation were very , very high . Those facts , which could have been easily established as the basis for decision-making at the time , were ignored . That 's why 150,000 of our troops are still trapped in a civil war . In exactly the same way , it has been known and provable to the satisfaction of any reasonable person for a long time that the climate crisis is real , that we 're responsible for it , that it 's extremely dangerous and that we have to start now if we 're going to solve it . In spite ofthat evidence , we brushed aside the facts and pursued a preconceived ideological notion offered up by ExxonMobil and the coal companies and other large carbon polluters that said , " The scientists are wrong , there 's no problem here . Move along , nothing to see , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ commitment to reduce carbon - and now we 're proposing to subsidize an acceleration in carbon pollution . So it 's the same problem . Our democracy is supposed to operate more often than not according to the rule of reason . A well-informed citizenry , to use the phrase our founders revered , has a conversation according to the best evidence available and tries to make the best decision . But that 's not how it works today . That 's what 's gone wrong . What figure in the administration , other than the president himself , do you hold most responsible for standing in the way of meaningful change on global warming ? Oh , Cheney , of course . Both Bush and Cheney come out of the carbon-extraction industry . But Cheney has been the more forceful determinant of the two where this issue is concerned . Not that Bush has ever wavered - he does what ExxonMobil wants , every single time . When support for action against the climate crisis rises , he sometimes tweaks his rhetoric ever so slightly . But he never actually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the contrary , he 's made it much , much worse . Here 's another thing Bush and Cheney have in common : Who would you rely on as the source of the best information about the wisdom of invading Iraq ? Ahmad Chalabi , of course . Who would you choose to rely on as the source of the best information about global warming ? Exxon-Mobil , of course . Are you at least glad that Bush now refers to our " addiction to foreign oil " ? I do n't like the addiction metaphor , because it carries with it a sense of power- lessness . But there are some aspects of the metaphor that are accurate in ways that Bush does n't intend . The spiral of increasingly self-destructive behavior spending more and more for supplies of a substance that is harder and harder to get - is just bizarre . I caused a stir in Alberta , Canada , recently when someone asked me about the advisability of trying to extract oil by processing the tar sands they have up there . I said , " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The then-premier of Alberta lost it - and has n't recovered since . You speak eloquently about forging a mass movement to halt global warming . But the surest way to kill any emerging movement is to put a new system in place , only to have it rigged to benefit the same old special interests . What 's going to keep the fossil-fuel industry ; . from creating offsets and other loopholes to profit from the kind of carbontrading system you advocate ? Wo n't Wall Street just get rich off this huge new commodity market ? Once you establish the framework , then the passionate advocates of solving this crisis can channel their energies into policing and improving the integrity of that framework . The emissions-trading system in the European Union experienced serious start-up mistakes , but now it 's actually working pretty damn well . It 's driving a hell of a lot of carbon reduction . And when the world as a whole adopts such a system , the synergies of a global market will be incredibly powerful . The day after that is put in place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the planet will have a fiduciary responsibility to aggressively reduce CO2 emissions . Because they wo n't be able to protect shareholder value if they do n't . What about a straight tax on carbon emissions , which many consider the single best way to curb climatewarming pollution ? We need both - a carbon tax and a capand-trade system where the emissions rights are auctioned and the revenue is plowed back into renewable-energy development . I challenge the conventional wisdom that we have to pick one or the other . If you replace the payroll tax with a tax on CO2 , it would discourage the destruction of the planet 's environment without increasing total taxes . And a global system that caps and trades emissions would create the most effective reductions in the shortest period of time . You 've devoted much of your life to building a movement to combat the climate crisis . Be honest : Would n't that movement be far , far better off if you were able to lead it as president ? I 'm going to do my best to provide leadership for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there are a lot of good reasons not to run for president . But as you know , I have n't completely ruled out getting involved in the political system again at some point in time - there 's no reason to do that . I hear myself repeating the same phrases , so forgive me if you hear that too . I really am focusing on this larger - make that different - kind of campaign . I wo n't say larger , because I know there 's no position that can even approach the position of president in terms of the ability to influence events . But the way our political system operates in the United States today , the politics of reason faces a head wind . The skills that are rewarded in this communications environment include a lot of skills I do n't think I possess in abundance . Some people catch on earlier than others that they 're not well suited to the career they 've chosen kugks . I 'm fighting through the denial right now . But do n't you think that this movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offset those perceived weaknesses ? What a devious question . I have n't heard that one before . Pauses I really think those two things are different tracks . If I do my job right , then the sea change I 'm trying to help accelerate will make it more likely that whoever runs in both parties will be forced to respond to a popular demand that they make the climate crisis the top priority . I know we 're not there yet . I know we 're not close to where we should be . But we 're closer . And I can see it from here . I can see it . We 've got to keep moving and build the momentum and pick up the pace . The Live Earth concerts on July 7th represent the starting gun . It 's a unique moment to ask for the world 's attention to deliver an SOS for the climate - and to then begin a multiyear campaign to persuade enough people at the grass-roots level to become a part of that mass movement . V/e 'll have a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who chooses to do so can mobilize . What 's the old Bob Dylan line ? " Come senators , congressmen , please heed the call/Rattle your windows " - what 's the rest of it ? " for the times they are a-changin ' ' . " That 's what I want to happen . And I think it 's going to . I really do .
