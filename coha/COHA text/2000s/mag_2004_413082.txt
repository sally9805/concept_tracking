Tracee Ellis Ross and Diana Ross celebrate the power of endless love Photograph Photograph // The silk slips and stilettos went flying behind a folding screen as two women with enormous eyes and raging curls changed costumes for their photo shoot together . One woman is a household name , a legend , the very definition of " diva " ; the other is an ingenue on the cusp of celebrity with a well-received role in an ensemble television series . Both are capable of playing the coquette , yet both are tougher than you might t hink , the older one having survived for decades in the fickle world of making music , the younger having secured an Ivy League degree after years of elite prep-school education . But the photo shoot , an otherwise glamorous affair with a truckload of cosmetics and attendants , is punctuated with a shriek that is familiar to almost every woman alive and goes to the heart of the true relationship between the two . " Mahhhhhhhh-ummmm !

The daughter is Tracee Ellis Ross , 31 , who grew up backstage , watching her mother apply blush and change costumes between sets and dreaming of being like her . The younger one is now following her own path as a star of the UPN series Girlfriends . Both women say that no matter how the public may see her , Diana Ross has been a mother first-a single mother for most of the time-kissing her brood of three now-grown daughters ( Rhonda , Tracee and Chudney ) and two teenage sons ( Ross and Evan ) goodnight before heading to the studio , making her signature zucchini casserole with Lipton onion soup for them , and calling from the road at bedtime when she was away . If her children knocked on the door seconds before showtime , she always let them in .

" I was absorbing , inhaling . I was in a delicious garden . One of my favorite things to do was sit on the floor and watch Mommy go through her ritual of getting ready . We 'd rarely talk . Sometimes the silence is the most precious time you can share with someone . " Photograph Photograph // A woman who has lived her entire adult life-its incredible ups and its very public downs-in the spotlight , Diana says that through it all her children have been her salvation .

No words . The look on her face said . " Just spit it out . Now . " " Some things fell by the wayside . " No , my mom did n't get to go to every play I was in , " Tracee says .

' " Photograph // In the last few years it has been Diana who has needed her share of support and encouragement . She navigated a divorce from her second husband , Arne Naess , who died earlier this year in a mountain hiking accident . Then there was the drunkdriving charge for which she spent two days in jail last winter . During hard times , Diana Ross says , her children are a source of strength , helping " her weather the storm .

" I 've had a wonderful career , but career does n't last forever . And the men have been fleeting . But my children are still here . " She glows at the thought .
