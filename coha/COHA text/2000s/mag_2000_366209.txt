At the auto industry 's annual coming-out party in Detroit last week , carmakers sent a loud message to baby boomers : Get in the backseat . Young , young , young  --  the word came up over and over again at virtually every one of the North American International Auto Show 's glitzy vehicle unveilings . And when the industry 's boomer executives were n't making impassioned pleas for attracting younger buyers , they simply turned to the babies themselves , who appeared in person or on MTV-inspired videos , twentysomethings and teeny boppers cooing over the many cars now aimed directly at them . Two of the industry 's new youth magnets , the Ford Focus and the Nissan Xterra , were voted car and truck of the year last week  --  coveted awards issued by North American auto journalists . <P> Ford , Nissan and other carmakers are focusing their attention on a generation barely old enough to drive , because the 70 million or so echo boomers ( born between 1977 and 1994 ) may grow up to be the most affluent generation ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have no interest in driving elephantine , fuel-swilling sport-utility vehicles and trucks . <P> That 's why carmakers are redefining the long-forgotten small-car segment , for which they are dreaming up new vehicles like DaimlerChrysler 's PT Cruiser and the Ford Escape . These latest creations may not be quite as fuel thrifty , but they are vast stylistic improvements over the lackluster econo-boxes of the 1970s and ' 80s . They have to be . The next generation wants a lot more for its money ( or Mom and Dad 's money ) , so today 's small cars are bulging with what the trade calls content  --  everything from power windows to CD players to telescoping steering wheels . <P> " The car companies have n't spent this kind of money since the baby boomers moved en masse into the market , " says Wesley Brown , an auto analyst with Nextrend in Thousand Oaks , Calif . " They know it 's much easier to bring new buyers to a brand while they 're 16 than it is to start conquering them at 40 . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on you to buy those profit-priming monster sport-utes and plushmobiles . In 1998 , for instance , about 2 million small cars were sold , a minimally profitable 14% of the total . " The baby boomers are still the lion 's share of the market , " says Marty Levine , DaimlerChrysler 's vice president of Chrysler Plymouth Jeep . That 's precisely why DaimlerChrysler has been careful not to refer publicly to its new PT Cruiser  --  which is built on a small-car chassis and whose voluptuous curves are reminiscent of the cars of the ' 30s  --  as a youth attraction . <P> At the same time , Daimler has so far confined advertising for the Cruiser to the Internet , where it has lined up 250,000 young , prospective buyers . And that list may get longer since the company put a budget $16,000 sticker price on the Cruiser . " You want to attract younger buyers , but you do n't want to tag it and say to boomers , ' This car is n't for you , ' " says Levine . Call it " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other executives know the clock is ticking on the boomers ' control over the industry . By 2007 Generations X and Y will account for 40% to 45% of total vehicle sales .
