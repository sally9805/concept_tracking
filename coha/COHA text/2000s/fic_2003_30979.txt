Chapter 3 Every Friday after school since the beginning of sixth grade , Addie , Joe , Skeezie , and I have gathered at the Candy Kitchen , last booth on the right  --  the one with the aforementioned torn red leatherette seats  --  to discuss important issues and eat ice cream . We call this the Forum . Due to the change in my employment status , we canned holding the Forum on a specific day of the week and decided we 'd have it whenever we felt like it . The Friday Forum became the Floating Forum . The minutes of the First Floating Forum of the Seventh-Grade Year are as follows : Addie : Today 's topic for discussion is " Liberty and Justice for All . " Skeezie : Do you have to write down every single word ? Addie : Talk more slowly , please . Skeezie : Geesh . Addie : Well , I guess we all know what happened in Ms. Wyman 's homeroom class this morning . Joe : You told us at lunch . Skeezie : It is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute , did you write my name down as Joe ? Addie : That is your name , the last I heard . Joe : Not anymore . Now it 's Scorpio . Skeezie : Scorpio ? ! Joe : You should talk , with a name like Skeezie . Bobby : What happened to Jodan ? Joe : Oh , that **42;376;TOOLONG thing ? That is sooo last week . I like Scorpio . It has , oh , I do n't know , energy . Skeezie : How about Plunger ? Joe : Plunger ? Skeezie : Yeah , like in toilet plunger . You get one of those things working , man , talk about energy . Joe : Wait a minute , I think I hear someone laughing . Oops , my mistake , that was someone gagging in the next booth . Skeezie : Ha . Addie : Excuse me , could we get back to the topic ? Joe : Could you write my name as Scorpio ? Addie : Okay , fine . Scorpio : Thank you . Addie : You 're welcome . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guys think there is liberty and justice for all in this country . Scorpio : No way . Bobby : Well , I think what the Pledge of Allegiance is about is idealism . You know , like , what we aim for . Addie : But that 's not what is says . It says promise . Bobby : Where ? It does n't say that word . Addie : Well , pledge , promise , same thing . The point is  - -  Scorpio : The point is there 's no way there is freedom and justice for everybody in this country . It 's , well , I do n't mean it 's like a total , you know , a totalism kind of thing , whatever it 's called . Addie : Totalitarianism . Scorpio : Yeah , that . I mean , it 's not like we 've got some dictator guy telling everybody they have to , I do n't know , like , wear polyester all the time or something grotesque like that . Skeezie : Oh , yeah , there 's a fate worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a little off the  - -  Bobby : It 's cool that you 're not saying the Pledge , Addie , I mean it 's cool that you 're standing up for your principles and all , but  - -  Addie : Thank you . Bobby : But what difference does it make ? I mean , just because you sit there and do n't say the words with everybody else , that 's not going to help some poor guy hundreds of miles downstate in New York City who gets beaten up just because he 's black or poor or something . Addie : I contend that it does make a difference . Skeezie : Oo , she contends . Where 's our food , if you do n't mind my asking ? Addie : Yes , I contend that every act of conscience makes a difference . Skeezie : But you 're talking about New York City . We do n't have the same kinds of problems here . Scorpio : Hello . Are you kidding ? Of course we do . Addie : Just on a smaller scale . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's better just to get along , not make waves . He says bringing attention can be a dangerous thing . Addie : Of course it can ! Just look at Abraham Lincoln or Martin Luther King or ... or ... Scorpio : Madonna . Or RuPaul . Addie : I do n't think they 're in quite the same league , Joe . I mean , Scorpio . Scorpio : They bring attention ! They 're like , " In your face , world ! Look at me ! This is who I am and if you do n't like it , stuff it ! I 'm as good as anybody else ! " Skeezie : Tell it ! Bobby : Whatever . The thing is , Ms. Wyman is not going to let you not say the Pledge , Addie , so what is the point ? Addie : Excuse me ? I do not believe Ms. Wyman has the right to tell me what I can and can not say . Have you never heard of the First Amendment ? Skeezie : Has that bozo who took our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you see that ? He just gave them their food and they came in here after we did ! Bobby : Maybe they 're friends of his . Skeezie : There you are , Addie , a perfect example of how there 's no liberty and justice for all . In a just world , I 'd be slurping my Dr Pepper by now and instead I 'm sitting here parched and deprived because Mr. HellomynameisAdam is giving preferential treatment to his friends . Justice , I say ! Justice ! Addie : Skeezie , stop pounding on the table . You 're making a scene . Skeezie : Justice ! Justice ! Bobby : I thought you wanted to bring attention , Addie . Addie : There 's bringing attention and then there 's bringing attention . I mean , a little kid throwing a tantrum in public is bringing attention and that 's closer to what Skeezie 's doing right now than my standing up for  - -  Scorpio : I was just thinking . RuPaul . I really like the sound of that . I think I 'm going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " D " capital , so you have to , like , emphasize the second syllable , you know ? Jo-Dan . Addie : What are you talking about ? Scorpio : No , no , do n't write Scorpio , write ... Addie : Oh , I get it . Okay . JoDan : Yeah , like that . That 's cool . Skeezie : I thought that was so last week . JoDan : With a small " d . " That was so last week . Skeezie : Right , whatever . Addie : So about liberty and justice for  - -  Skeezie : All right ! Here 's our food . See , a little protest 'll work every time . You were right , Addie ! It pays to act on your conscience . Hey , I learned something today . These Forums are way cool . Hey , hey , wait a minute . HellomynameisAdam : What 's wrong ? Skeezie : This Dr Pepper is flat , my man . You got ta get me another . HellomynameisAdam : Look ... Skeezie : Justice ! Justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cool your jets , will you ? Skeezie : Peace , brother . We do not record the rest of the proceedings , since we never do get back on the topic . If I recall correctly , we spend the rest of our time at the Candy Kitchen that Monday talking about who are the meanest teachers in seventh grade and who are the best . Ms. Wyman scores points in both categories .
