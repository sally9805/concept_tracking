testaments Headnote Lent is the time when Darth Vader and other princes of darkness come to church . Photograph // I COULD HARDLY BELIEVE MY EYES , BUT THERE HE WAS . Dancing along the back of the pew , two rows ahead of me , the Dark Side of the Force himself , Darth Vader ! Before now , I had only seen him in the Star Wars movies , my nephew 's bedroom , and a few select nightmares . But last Sunday at St. Catherine 's , Darth Vader finally made it to Mass . It was eerie to see him there , black cape hurled outward , cutting a sinister figure against the background of the people . His owner , a small boy about the age of 5 , appeared over the rim of the pew , engineering the rest of the dance with a somber face . His parents never moved on either side of him , intent on a homily I had long lost track of . If they were aware that one of the most vigilant soldiers of the forces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they gave no indication . But the juxtaposition of altar and light-saber-wielding antihero threw me into a new dimension of contemplation entirely . Sunday morning had suddenly gotten a whole lot weirder . Darth Vader in church ? Before this weekend , I had grown used to seeing picture books and Cheerios and Beanie Babies in the pews . Kid 's stuff is rarely distracting during the liturgy . It 's the grown-up stuff-the pagers and cell phones and watches going off during the Eucharistic Prayer-that are really annoying . But until now , there had seemed to be an invisible line drawn in the vestibule about who 's in and who 's out . Barbie and Ken , as far as I knew , steered clear of formal worship . Even though my sister had once baptized all of her dolls in a moment of zeal , they had never gotten into the habit of attendance on Sunday . What made the appearance of Darth Vader in the assembly so stunning , of course , was the idea that the celebrated prince of the Dark Side seemed out of place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unmasked as the long-lost father of Luke Skywalker , a young man dedicated to the principles of light and good , according to the Star Wars legend . But old Darth himself had long ago lost touch with the bright side of the Force . What could a prince of darkness hope to gain by coming to church ? The devil himself quotes scripture , I thought . This is one of the eeriest revelations of the Lenten season : That in the story of the temptation of Jesus , the devil turns out to be well  --  versed in the word of God . The relationship between the bright and dark side of the Force in the Star Wars tradition finds some support in the Bible . Good and evil impulses reside within the same human heart . Human freedom contains the capacity to exercise the will for selfish or altruistic ends . Jesus and the devil keep company in the desert together , and when they do , they do n't do battle , at least not in the classic sense of a fistfight . Instead , they do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they consider the moral choices that the individual must make : whether to serve God or the self . And most disturbingly , both Jesus and the devil use the same Bible to represent their positions . Each Lent begins in the starkness of a desert landscape . Only three characters people this region : Jesus , the devil , and human freedom . We might say that Lent is all about the light , the darkness , and us . It 's about the choices we make in the black-and-white options the desert provides : life , or death . In such a barren environment , there is no middle ground . We either choose to serve God or mammon . It is interesting that the other great battle for the human soul that we ponder on the first Sunday of Lent occurs in a garden , the very antithesis of the desert . Here among the lushness of greening things , good and evil seem more ambiguous , and Adam and Eve more easily beguiled . They are surrounded by a creation that God has pronounced " good " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bad ? In a world where they have never known fear , how can the suggestion of this humble serpent be something that should strike terror in their souls ? In the garden , according to the ancient story , humanity was first bewildered and deceived . In the midst of sensuous satisfaction , what is evil might well be mistaken for what is good . This is at least one reason why we repair to the desert at the start of Lent , to rid ourselves of the ambiguities and distractions that make the distinctions between good and bad fuzzy for us . We want to see clearly . We want to hear the call of God that comes as a whisper , above the roar of the rest of our lives clamoring for attention . We come to declare allegiances , again , to cast off deeds of darkness and put on the armor of light . We are preparing for that moment at Easter , when we will denounce Satan , the prince of darkness , and all of his lies and empty promises . Before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the emptiness of the desert , see the claims of the material world for what they are , and choose with all of our fervor our primary commitment to Christ . These are serious things . It is no wonder that for many Catholics , the most significant day of the church year is not Christmas or Easter but Ash Wednesday , easily the best  --  attended service of the year . Getting marked with the ashes is , in a sense , refusing the " mark of the beast " that haunts the apocalyptic writings of the Book of Revelation . The ashes remind us that we are dust , but they also disavow our allegiance to the things that are dust . We acknowledge our mortality , and in this humble frame of mind ask for the help we know we need to withstand the allure of baubles and gold . Because , doggone it , Darth Vader is Luke 's father , capable of real choices for good or evil ( as the third Star Wars movie illustrates , fans may remember ) , just as Lucifer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ light he long ago represented . Darkness and light are not entirely alien forces but are rather the continuum of the same energy . The impulse to do evil is related to the impulse to do good , just as the lie bears some relationship to the truth in order to better deceive us . The attraction we have to the material world is not an innate desire for evil . It is the desire for what is good , the yearning for comfort and pleasure and beauty that is built into creation . And in themselves , these things do no harm . Jesus himself was disparaged by his enemies for being a glutton and a drunkard , for dining really with the Pharisees one night and partying with sinners the next . Unlike John the Baptist , Jesus was not an ascetic , and he did not exhort his followers to austere spiritual practices . Jesus appreciated the good things of the Earth for what they are . He just did n't put his treasure in such a passing investment . WHAT MAKES THE MATERIAL WORLD THE VERY REPOSItory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , this life , this person , these things-and make the tangible reality the only one that matters . When we pledge our allegiance to creation instead of to the Creator and want a better deal , as Adam and Eve did , than the one God has already promised us , we have crossed the threshold into the devil 's territory . The light becomes the darkness so gradually , we hardly notice the setting of the sun . Theologically speaking , this seduction is the sadness at the root of all evil ; that what was meant for the enhancement of life has become the instrument of death . Darth Vader is a tragic figure just as Lucifer is , an angel of light who was tempted by the dark side . Yet Darth is perhaps a more hopeful expression of that idea , because he in turn gives paternity to a child who will become dedicated to the light he so bitterly lost-and through whom is his one chance for salvation . Is there hope for Darth Vader 's poor soul ? Should we rejoice to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evil comes to church , " when we admit before God and everybody that we are sinners , locked in a fateful battle between the desire to be the holy people we were born to be and the continuous tug to surrender to more selfish and immediate cravings . We wear ashes as a sign of the sin that mars us and marks us for death . We ask for the courage to enter the Lenten desert for 40 days and to examine , sometimes coolly , sometimes more passionately , the ways in which the dark side strives for possession of our souls . We fast to gain spiritual resources and to denounce our loyalty to material satisfaction . We practice charity , giving away worldly treasure that might otherwise stake a claim on our hearts . We pray and pray and pray some more , fastening our gaze on the cross , the supreme reminder not to cling to this life no matter how dear this old world may seem . Perhaps because the glories of heaven are revealed at Easter , the horrors of hell become more visible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glance , it may seem that evil has no place in church . Sacred spaces are built to house holy things like sacraments and liturgies and consecrated people . We come to church " to get away from it all , " the snarl and tangle of human misery that sin has woven . We want to see saints here , not sinners . We come here to lift our eyes to heaven , not to see the wreck we 've made of Earth . Yet it has been part of Catholic tradition to bring our sins to church , to confess them here , to use this consecrated spot as a dumping ground for our rejection of the empty promises of the world . We relegate our darkest moments to the trash heap outside the confessional and the reconciliation room . Honestly , if we ca n't take our sins to church , what in the world can we do with them ? And if we sanitize our sacred places and try to keep sin and sinners out , what can we make of the fact that the devil kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was banished , the Bible tells us , the devil merely retreated to await another opportunity . The demons followed Jesus everywhere , yelping at him from the interior of the possessed , the first to recognize him in every crowd . Jesus often said he came to call sinners , not the righteous , to repentance . If we try to keep sinners out of churches , who will come to Mass on Sunday ? So maybe it 's a hopeful sign that Darth Vader made it to Mass last week . Maybe it will do him some good . And just maybe he will remind us all that we harbor the dark side within ourselves , and we have to be deliberate about choosing the light . Sidebar We want to see clearly .
