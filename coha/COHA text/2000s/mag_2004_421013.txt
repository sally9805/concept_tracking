Section : I WON THE FAT WAR ! Faith helped Pauline Hines drop 125 pounds <p> Liquid diets . Diet pills . Low-carb diets . Starvation . I had tried it all , with the same result : I 'd say goodbye to a few pounds , but they always returned . <p> Then in the spring of 1996 , my friend Judy invited me to join a local chapter of First Place , a Bible based weight loss program . After so many failures , I knew I could not succeed on my own , especially if I did n't believe in what I was doing . I might as well try the Lord , I thought . The Miracle Begins <p> First Place does more than help you lose weight . Created in Houston in 1981 , the program focuses on balancing all aspects of life : spiritual , physical , emotional , and mental . You 're asked to make nine commitments , which include attendance , support , Bible study , and adherence to a sensible diet and exercise regime . <p> When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt at home . I was surrounded by people of faith who , like me , had struggled with their weight and were turning to God for help . I weighed in at 296 lb . Spring Cleaning <p> Following the group 's mandate , first I purged my cabinets of tempting foods . Out went the potato chips , chocolates , Oreos , and caramel corn . I was starting fresh . In addition to asking all members to keep a personal journal and food diary , First Place makes specific meal recommendations based on the Food Guide Pyramid . These could n't have been more different from what I had been eating . <p> My breakfast of grits , eggs , bacon , and toast slathered with jam turned into a much simpler meal : either cereal with fat-free milk and coffee , or toast , fruit , and juice . Lunch , which had often been fried chicken , collard greens cooked with ham hocks and oil , and potatoes from the cafeteria at the school where I teach , became a big garden salad with low-fat dressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ needed a snack , I swapped vending machine goodies for an apple or carrot sticks . <p> Since I usually go from work to a church meeting , I often do n't get home until late . Exhausted , I used to make a sandwich of leftovers , then gorge myself on ice cream or cake . First Place taught me to eat earlier when possible , or enjoy a light dinner so that I was n't going to bed on a full stomach . I also learned portion control , drank lots of water , and prepared healthier versions of my favorites , such as baked chicken , greens simmered in chicken broth , and brown rice . Strength in Numbers <p> I wo n't pretend that any of this was easy or that I never caved in to temptation , but this time I turned to fellow First Place members for support . With them , I could admit my downfalls and talk through my problems without feeling judged . I began to understand that I had been relying on food to comfort me when I was lonely or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ focus on what was really important-caring for others and loving myself  --  and take strength from my faith . From a social perspective , friends and colleagues kept me going . They 'd tell me I was doing great , and if they saw me heading for the vending machine , they would gently remind me of my goal . <p> When I stepped on the scale at the end of the first 13-week session , I was delighted to discover I 'd lost 25 lb . God was helping me accomplish what I had not been able to do alone . Keep the Faith <p> During the summer before the next First Place session started , I continued to follow my food plan and to exercise . When I first joined the program , I had started walking a slow 30-minute mile four times a week with my friend Judy . I gradually worked up to 3 and 4 miles at a time . What began as footburning drudgery had become a time to catch up or , if I was alone , to reflect and memorize scripture verses . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few more pounds before the fall session . By the end of that first year , I 'd lost 45 lb . <p> I did n't always lose weight at the same pace . At times , such as after my mother 's death , I simply held steady to the progress I 'd made while I focused on my emotional health . And like many other people , I 'd gain a few pounds during the holidays . Still , First Place always steered me back on track . By October 2000 , 4 1/2 years after I had joined the program , I reached my weight loss goal : I had shed 125 lb . Beyond Weight Loss <p> Losing that weight also improved my health . With my doctor 's okay , I was able to stop taking blood pressure and cholesterol meds . I also gained energy . I still walk quite a bit and have joined a gym where I take aerobics classes and lift weights . I feel more centered , and I 've formed close friendships . Now , I have the strength to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ First Place chapter at my church and am overjoyed to share the incredible gift God has given me .
