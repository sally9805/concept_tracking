<p> At the San Diego Zoo , tourists are lining up for America 's first close-up glimpse of a fuzzy , pudgy , incomparably adorable panda cub . <p> Like thrill-seekers waiting for a roller-coaster ride , they zig-zag through the line , snap a few pictures and exit near the gift shop , asking their companions : " Want to do it again ? " <p> But for all her natural ability to warm hearts and sell souvenirs , 8-month-old Hua Mei has a far more serious job . Researchers hope the first surviving panda cub born in the United States will help unlock the secrets that will keep her endangered species from disappearing . <p> On a trip to China this month , officials from Oakland and its zoo signed a letter of intent with the Chinese government , beginning the long and difficult process of receiving a panda loan from their native country . But to succeed , officials first will have to convince their own federal government that research in the United States will directly benefit the survival of the wild panda population , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we really turn things around now , in this period of five to 10 years , we may not have many pandas left by 2005 , " said Don Lindburg , head of San Diego 's panda research team , which is studying how the bears communicate as well as their breeding and infant development . <p> Extremely elusive in the wild , giant pandas live in remote , mountainous bamboo forests in southwestern China . Their biggest threat is human encroachment , mostly from logging , that has reduced their habitat to isolated pockets . <p> There are also 127 pandas in captivity , mostly in Chinese zoos and breeding centers , Lindburg said . Just five of them live in the United States : Hua Mei and her two parents at the San Diego Zoo and a panda pair recently transplanted to Zoo Atlanta . <p> OTHER ZOOS CLAMORING <p> About a dozen U.S. zoos are attempting to get pandas from China , and the National Zoo in Washington , D.C. , announced last week that it had signed a letter of intent with the Chinese to replace its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to then-President Richard Nixon as a gift of friendship from the Chinese in 1972 . Ling-Ling died in 1992 , and Hsing-Hsing was euthanized last November because of kidney disease . <p> But China no longer gives its pandas away . Interested zoos must pay $1.2 million a year for a 10-year loan of a panda pair . The money has to be used by China for panda conservation . And cubs born in the United States , like Hua Mei , must be returned to China when they are 3 . <p> San Diego received its pandas in September 1996 and has spent more than $10 million since on its panda project . Like all loaned pandas , the zoo 's pair did not come from the healthy wild population . The female , Bai Yun , had been born in captivity in China and the male , Shi Shi , had been injured . <p> COMMUNICATION BY SCENT <p> The zoo 's 30-member research team has been focusing on panda communication . Because they are solitary animals in the wild , pandas use chemical scent marking  --  by rubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  to leave each other messages , " like putting up a notice on a community bulletin board , " Lindburg said . <p> Males mark to define their territory  --  sometimes doing hand stands to leave the scent high on a tree trunk  --  while females do so to alert males they are in estrus , Lindburg said . Researchers are trying to determine what other information pandas can discern from a scent mark . <p> They also believe they may someday be able to apply their scent marking findings in the wild . For instance , they could try to lead a male from one habitat pocket to another to increase the gene pool , or attempt to reintroduce a captive panda into the wild by first familiarizing other pandas with its scent . <p> San Diego researchers have also been able to extract DNA from scent marks , a technique that could be used to study the wild population without trapping animals for invasive tests . <p> Part of the problem in understanding the panda and its situation is that no one knows for sure how many there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last count was done in the mid-1980s . <p> The World Wildlife Fund , whose symbol is a panda , just began a two-year census of China 's panda population , which should produce a better estimate and indicate where pandas are most threatened and where they are doing well . <p> GAINING INSIGHT <p> Meanwhile , researchers say they are obtaining invaluable information about pandas in captivity that will help them better understand their elusive brethren in the wild . <p> The birth of Hua Mei , whose name means " China-USA , " is one such opportunity . <p> Zoos have had a terrible time breeding pandas in captivity . Females ovulate for a short time only once a year , and most males in captivity refuse to mate . Furthermore , the survival rate of cubs born in captivity is low . <p> All five cubs born at the National Zoo died , and one breeding center in China had a 90 percent mortality rate until last year . That was when a formula created by a San Diego Zoo nutritionist was used for the human-reared pandas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the key focus of the research in Atlanta , where researchers have been studying their panda pair since their birth in captivity in China . <p> Oakland Zoo officials are considering nutrition research , including looking for a substitute for bamboo , pandas ' staple food . While they had hoped to use their China trip to help craft a program , zoo Executive Director Dr. Joel Parrott was unable to talk with researchers there . <p> In San Diego , the work of endocrinologist Nancy Czekala led to the successful artificial insemination of Bai Yun with Shi Shi 's sperm last April . Four months later , on Aug. 21 , 1999 , Hua Mei was born at a mere 4 ounces , blind and covered with white fuzz and looking more like a rodent than a panda . <p> PANDA BABY BOOK ' <p> Researchers watched the early days with a video camera in the birthing den . They have chronicled each milestone much like human mothers who jot notes in their baby books : when the cub first flipped over , when she opened her eyes ( nearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first steps and first attempted to climb a tree . <p> When Hua Mei was 5 weeks old , the public had the chance to join in via the zoo 's " panda cam , " though the area remained closed to the public until February . The zoo 's web site ( sandiegozoo.org ) now receives 2.7 million hits each month , three times the number before the cub was born , though zoo attendance has not increased . <p> Today , volunteers spend two hours a day monitoring Hua Mei 's behavior , checking off her activities once a minute . The 30-pound cub spends most of her time perched in a tree , sleeping or playing with mom . She is still nursing , though she has begun to taste bamboo . <p> Researchers also monitor all three pandas for signs of stress . If they show any , they will be taken off public display . <p> Hua Mei 's every move , even which nipple she nurses from , is of critical interest to researchers because this is among the first opportunities to study a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There 's just a huge gap in knowledge we 're trying to fill , " Lindburg said . Hua Mei 's birth , he added , " is like no other event that I can think of in attracting attention to pandas . This might be a critical watershed to do the things that have to be done .
