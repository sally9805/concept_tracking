As I lay in the rafters of the Old West Cattle Co. , surrounded by dust , shadows , and the smell of stale hay , anticipation raced through me . I cradled an A-7 pyre-rifle in my hands , the barrel aimed at a steep angle . Below me , several halogens hung strategically from the walls , giving me the visibility I needed , but at the same time shielding me from view . No one wanted to stare up at those harsh lights . To be honest , I did n't like staring down at them . The warehouse boasted no furniture for my target to hide behind . Only people ( human and alien ) , dirty floors , and weapons . Right now , a crowd of other-worlders teased and taunted two naked , whimpering females banded to the far wall . The bastards who were n't participating were watching , waiting their turn . My anticipation for the kill increased , and I gripped my gun tighter . The tormentors were having such a lovely time , but my fun would come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deadly fire . See , I 'm paid by the government to destroy other-worlders so vile , so disgusting , they ca n't take a chance alien rights advocates will get involved in the case . I 'm not A.I.R. , Alien Investigation and Removal . I 'm worse . Just a little longer , Eden . Information first . Kill second . EenLi ( my target ) and hiscompadres were abducting humans and shipping them off-planet to sell as slaves . I needed to know where they were storing the human " cargo " before deportation . More than that , I needed to know how they were hopping from one planet to another . Oh , I knew they were using interworld portals  --  the same portals they 'd used to invade our planet . I just did n't know where or how to find these portals . I should have known exactly where they were . I 'm an alien . A Raka . A golden one , some humans call us , because our hair , skin , and eyes resemble liquid gold . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ portals are as much a mystery to me as they are to every other Earth-born . One of the women screamed , slicing into my thoughts . A man was pinching and twisting her nipples , laughing while he did it , laughing while she writhed and sobbed in pain . My finger twitched on the trigger . Hold . Hold . Tonight I 'm going to prove I 'm as capable as any man  --  as any human . Over the years I 've been delegated the easy marks , the ones requiring no more skill than a blind man in a virtual game . Since my father is also my boss , he 's the reason for my lack of hard-core cases . I know he hopes to protect me , but I 'm long past the need . My success tonight is critical . I took this case against his wishes , and I would not fail . I had my target in sight : EenLi Kati , a.k.a . John Wayne and Wayne Johnson . He was a thirty-something Mec , average height , with eerie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Mecs , only that they had some control over the weather and preferred hot , dry climates . Like every Mec , EenLi possessed opalescent skin that glowed different colors with different emotions . He was the leader of this elusive group , and right now his skin glowed bright red . The bastard was pissed . Dressed like a desperado from the past  --  hat , boots , and spurs  --  he stood in a shadowed corner , arguing fiercely with another Mec known as Mris-ste . The latter wore boots and spurs , but had opted not to wear a hat . Who did they think they were fooling ? Cowboys . Please . They spoke in their native tongue  --  a halting , guttural rhetoric of clipped syllables and high-pitched timbres . Languages were one of my specialties , and I 'd mastered this one years ago . As I listened , I managed to pick up words like bodies , profit , and underground . Technically my assignment is to eliminate EenLi . However , I 'm going to do Mris-ste for free . A bonus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips curled into a half smile . The two men had been working together for over a year . No telling how many men and women they 'd raped . No telling how many people they 'd enslaved . I drew in a measured breath , then slowly and calmly released every molecule of air . Sharp , spiky splinters from the old wooden rafters dug past my shirt and into my belly , but that was n't the worst of my discomfort . The air was stifling and hot , and it did n't help that I wore military fatigues and a face mask . The heat wave blasting through New Dallas had yet to dissipate  --  probably because of the Mecs . Sweat pooled between my shoulder blades and ran down my back . I yearned to spirit-walk just then , to force my consciousness out of my body so I could leave my body behind and walk unnoticed , invisible , below . Like a ghost . A phantom . I had killed many of my targets like that , but I only did so when my body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left physically vulnerable because I could n't do my job and guard my body at the same time . Just then EenLi 's cell unit erupted in a series of beeps , and he barked an irritated " What ? " into the receiver . I could n't hear the voice on the other end , but whatever was said caused the other-worlder 's spine to stiffen and his fingers to clench into fists . One heartbeat of time passed . Two . As he continued to listen , he removed his hat and swirled the gray felt between his fingers . Give the man a pony and ask him to shout " Yee haw . " That 's all the scene lacked . By the time he returned his hat to his shiny , bald head , his skin pulsed so brightly red , I wanted to shade my eyes . Finally , he replaced the unit in his back pocket . Then , growling low in his throat , he shoved Mris-ste , propelling the hatless Mec backward . The latter man 's long , dark hair ( obviously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me you moved the tainted cattle from the Pit , " EenLi shouted . " Tell me you have not screwed this up yet again . " The pit . The pit . I rolled the phrase through my mind . An image quickly clicked into place , and I frowned . The Pit was a local bar known for its criminal patrons , druggies and whores who bought their way into oblivion . Could that be the place under discussion ? " Well , I  --  they have been moved , " the other man offered , righting himself . " I am not so stupid that I would leave the sick in cells with the healthy . " Cells ... I 'd followed EenLi inside the bar just two days ago , but he never left the main area . Never even went to the bathroom . I had n't noticed any doorways leading to other rooms . The cells could be hidden . Or underground . Very , very interesting . " Do you want to know who just called me , Mris-ste ? Pablo . He found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd obviously been sick , and you left them there . " " I ... I ... " Mris-ste 's opalescent skin began to pulse with blue . Even without the distinctive shading , the alien would have reeked of fear . " How many died in the move ? " EenLi demanded . " Three , " came the shaky reply . This enraged EenLi further . His scowl turned black . " We were to deliver twelve . Not seven . You idiot ! " " I am sorry . " " Your sorry does n't bring my cattle back to life . If one more is lost , just one more , I will sell your worthless hide to make up the difference . " Mris-ste shook off the threat with a nervous laugh . " We will not lose any more . This I swear . I gave the sick to Rose . She will care for them until they are well . " I knew Rose . Sahara Rose , human . Twenty-six years old . Blond hair . Blue eyes . I 'd trailed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a known alien sympathizer and had spent many nights in EenLi 's bed . I knew where she lived , what kind of car she drove , and what brand of vaginal lubricant she secretly used whenever her lover visited . And , of course , I now knew she was hiding some of the missing humans . " There is no time to find more cattle , " EenLi said . " The portal opens in one day . " The portals were n't always open ? I 'd always assumed aliens traveled through whenever they wanted . Tell me where they are ... tell me where they are ... He did n't . EenLi soon changed the subject , and the two men actually began discussing how to dress the female slaves . Information I did n't need . It was time . I preferred close kills to shots fired over a long distance . Nothing wrong with enjoying the fruits of my labor up close and personal . Sauntering into the middle of all those men , however , significantly decreased my odds of success . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one eye , my face mask and powered autoscope narrowing my field of vision . Still locked on target ? Check . Disposable silencer in place ? Check . I knew I had one chance to nail him . Just one . Because the moment I fired , everyone below me would whip into action , aiming and firing their own weapons straight at me . EenLi began to pace in front of Mris-ste as he expounded on the merits of stiletto heels and kristales , jewel stones brought over from Mecca . I kept my barrel still . My pyre-rifle produced heat-sensitive fire bullets , and those would follow him straight into hell . One . He moved away from Mris-ste . Two . He turned , facing Mris-ste . Three . He stepped into my line of fire , and I squeezed the trigger . A whiz . A scream . The big , bad Mec went down like a depressurized hovercraft , his hat rolling off his head like tumbleweed . Only it was the wrong Mec . This one had thick brown hair . I stilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mris-ste . Not EenLi . When had EenLi given him the hat ? When the hell had EenLi given him the hat ? I 'd watched them . Once I 'd locked on target , I had n't lost my focus . Shock bubbled inside me as the men below cursed and shouted , scrambling for their guns . Bullets and blue fire launched in my direction , raining like deadly hail . Remaining calm , focused , I dropped my rifle and grabbed the thick wire beside me , already anchored to a sturdy beam . Then I jumped . I kept one hand clasped to the metal handle that allowed my downward slide , and used the other to whip out the pyre-gun strapped to my waist , dialed to kill . I started firing . As I descended , a bullet cut into my left forearm . I did n't stop , did n't even slow down . The determination rushing through my veins muted the fiery sensation of being shot to a sharp sting . Oh , I knew I would feel it later  --  in full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The longer the slug remained inside my body , the more damage it would do to me . Earth metals act as a deadly poison to me . To all of my kind . But the mission came first . I had to finish this . Fast . Maintaining my inner balance , I continued shooting , not taking time to aim , but simply allowing a continuous stream of fire to discharge ; the blue beams of molten heat spewing from my gun lit up the warehouse like a nuclear war . The moment my feet hit the ground , I released the wire and reached for my other gun . With both of my hands armed , I scanned from left to right , taking in every detail . EenLi was gone . Gone ! He must have hit the door running the second Mris-ste fell . I could n't chase him down , not pinned in by gunfire like I was . That meant ... I 'd failed . My shock grew , almost freezing me in place , but I kept firing . Kept moving . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'd missed my target and allowed him to stroll from the building as happy as he pleased . I failed echoed continuously through my mind . I shook my head in disbelief . All I could do now was get the two women and myself out of here alive . No , I thought in the next instant . I was taking down any man who 'd been stupid enough to stay . My gaze scanned the area again . Five aliens remained inside the warehouse , their bullets and fire spraying all around me . Calculating the distance between them and the chained women , I started running forward . Right at them . I cringed when another bullet struck me . Twenty feet . Not much , but enough to risk what I was about to do . I dropped one of my weapons and reached for a mini grenade in my side pouch . In one fluid motion , I pulled the firing pin with my teeth , tossed it , and dove to the ground . Boom ! The impact threw me backward , slamming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was able to breathe , dirt and ash bypassed my mask and filled my nostrils . Instinctively , I covered my face with my hands as fiery wood chips rained . Then , several minutes passed in silence . No return fire . No screams or moans . When I looked up , all five Mecs were strewn across the ground , lifeless . The human women were bloody and bruised , but alive . They were  --  No , I realized then . Only one of them was alive . The blonde . The other , the one with curling red hair , had been caught in the crossfire and stared out at the charred warehouse through lifeless eyes . My eyelids squeezed shut , and I let my head sink into my hands again . The atmosphere was thick , hot , and laden with smoke . I needed to drag in a deep breath , to fill my lungs with oxygen , but did n't dare . There was no help for it , no other choice ; I had to call my father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said , " Boss , " taking comfort in the sound of the automatic dial . I trusted this man with my life . He was the one who had found me as a small child , alone and lost on the streets after my parents died . I do n't know why he 'd taken me in , and I could n't ask him . He stiffened every time I brought up that horrible night . But he 'd raised me , loved me , and trained me to be an assassin just like himself . And I had just let him down . He answered after two rings . " What happened ? " were the first words he spoke , his raspy voice upbeat . He clearly expected me to give him the usual " all went well " report . Over and over he 'd advised me not to take this case . When he 'd realized he could n't talk me out of it , he 'd followed me here " just in case I needed him . " Most important information first . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one human casualty , another wounded . " My self-disgust rang loud and clear in my tone . " How in the hell , " Michael , my father , said haltingly , " did that happen ? " " I do n't know . I had him locked . I fired , and the next thing I knew , he 'd switched places with his partner . " " How ? " " I do n't know , " I repeated . " Goddamn it , Eden F. " He only called me that when he was mad , or seriously worried . " I told you not to take this case . I told you to leave it alone . " " I 'm sorry , " I said on a ragged breath . And I was . Because of my failure , a human slaver was even now roaming free . Worse , he knew he was being hunted . He 'd be more careful now . I 'd just screwed the entire operation . " I think some of the slaves are in cells inside the Pit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town . " I opened my mouth to tell him the rest , but my mind went blank . A thick fog covered my thoughts . I blinked , shook my head and beckoned them back . " Some are with a human , Sahara Rose . " " I 'll put a man on it . You bring the survivor to me . Goddamn it , " he snarled again and disconnected . Silence greeted me . And in the silence , I noticed that the throbbing in my arm had increased . I looked down . Though my vision was clouding , I studied the gaping , oozing wound . The bullet had done more damage than I 'd thought . I was losing blood fast . Too fast . Fighting past the pain and weakness , I pushed to my feet . My knees wobbled , and my bones liquified , and neither showed any sign of improving . Even my stomach battled a sharp pain . I stumbled over to the woman . She flinched as I reached out and cut her free . Then she sank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covering her naked shoulders . I tried not to think about the other one , the one who would n't go home this night or any other . The crossbow strapped to my back suddenly weighed me down like a concrete block , and the ache in my stomach intensified . It was becoming harder and harder to breathe . A wave of dizziness assaulted me , heavy and strangely seductive ... lulling me to the ground beside the woman . When our arms touched , she uttered a terrified gasp and hastily scooted away . Her movements were so jerky , she flung dirt onto my legs . I wanted to comfort her , but my mouth refused to form the right words . What the hell was wrong with my stomach ? Slowly , so slowly , I lifted my shirt . There , just below my ribs , was another bloody , gaping wound . When had I received that ? I had n't even felt the bullet go in . Wait . Yes , I had . When I 'd run with the mini-grenade . Damn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouch , withdrawing a thin silver Extractor . Bracing myself for what I was about to do , I bit my bottom lip , centered all of my strength , and jabbed the damn thing into my stomach wound . Instantly the metal-sensitive prongs elongated and probed for the bullet . A scream ripped from me . How much time passed before the small , round tip was removed , I did n't know . I only knew desperation , pain . And fear . I was n't ready to die . Not here . Not now . I laughed humorlessly . Not as a failure . Concentrate . I had to concentrate . Though I craved a moment 's rest , a single moment to close my eyes , I repeated the entire process , shoving the now bloody device into my forearm . When I pulled out the last bullet , my shoulders and back sagged in relief . Distantly , I heard the woman crying . Quickly losing energy , I found the syringe in my pouch and injected myself in the heart with pure molybdenum to slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were made of . Searing pain erupted . I screamed again , long and loud , until my vocal cords cracked . The now-empty syringe fell from my suddenly limp fingers . I hurt everywhere , but a comforting lethargy was already working through me . A minute , maybe less , and I 'd be out . I reached blindly for my cell unit , my fingers somehow closing around it . " Boss , " I said . The word emerged so weak and broken , I experienced a moment 's surprise when the phone began to automatically dial . He answered on the fifth ring this time . " What ? " " I 'm hit . " " It just gets better every time you call , " he said , his sarcasm heavy . I caught the thick undercurrent of concern , however . " Can you make it to the safe house ? " " I 'll ... " A murky web of darkness wove through my mind , blackening my eyesight , paralyzing my muscles . " Try . " Oblivion seized me in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
