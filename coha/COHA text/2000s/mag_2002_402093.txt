On my daughter Leah 's 11th birthday , she called home from Camp George in Parry Sound , Ontario . " My friends made me presents . I got a pompom person , a gimp bracelet and a heart-shaped rock . And at rest hour , " she continued breathlessly , " our cabin had a secret swim . We scooped up clay from the bottom of the lake and slathered it on each other . It was amazing . " At sleepover camps , adventures like these are as common as mosquito bites . Nothing in the " real world " compares to the magic of camp . Despite what you read in brochures , camp is more than rock climbing , canoeing and candle making . For a few weeks away from school , parents and everyday commitments , kids are immersed in a self-contained universe where anything is possible .

With camp directors and counsellors as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and campfires . On this sneak-peek tour , you 'll learn how camp staff puts the sizzle in your child 's summer . 1st stop : Counsellors First , meet the high-school and university students who provide front-line care for your kids . " Kids think counsellors are like parents  --  only cool , " says Kim Mercer , who 's spent 17 summers as a camper and counsellor at Ontario Pioneer Camp in Muskoka , Ontario . My daughter and her cabin mates think the sun rises and sets on their counsellor ; they also think she 's a bit nuts . " She makes us sing the " Brown squirrel , brown squirrel , shake your bushy tail ' song before we get bedtime snack , " Leah laughs . Nutty or nice , your child 's counsellor can make or break his summer . " The whole camp experience gets bottled up in your child 's counsellor , " says Mercer . " I feel like a cartoon character because working at camp is like being on stage all the time . We tend to make everything big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he may look like a punchline , but this student with dyed green hair wearing a goofy costume running around with your kid on his shoulders is most likely a caring , responsible individual . Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed At Adventure Camp ( Pioneer Camp 's program for younger kids ) , two counsellors took it upon themselves to work with a camper who was bullying other kids . Camp director Adam Bell says the two spent some quiet time fishing with him . On the camper 's second cast , he pulled out an enormous fish . " We took his photo and he showed it to everyone at camp , " Bell says . " It was a turning point for him  --  his whole self-concept changed . Before he was the guy who picked on people ; now he was the fisherman . " 2nd stop : Cabins Welcome to your child 's ephemeral summer home . Try to ignore the lingering odour of wet towels and grubby socks . The camp cabin is a social microcosm where lifelong friendships are forged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worry your child will feel intimidated and homesick the first time she steps into this foreign dwelling with kids she 's never met  --  but it 's doubtful she 'll have the time . Like most camps , Kandalore in Dorset , Ontario , gets campers busy the moment they step off the bus . Emily Foster , who 's worked for six summers at Kandalore , has girls colour name tags for their beds while they chat about favourite TV stars and music . Other kids bond best while playing large-group games such as circle Frisbee . And one counsellor gets them giggling as they chase him in circles outside the cabin , Foster says . Often what cements the bond between cabin mates are the slightly nefarious activities the kids get up to as a group . Leah describes a night of moonlit mischief at Camp George . " When everyone was asleep , we dressed in black and snuck into the tuck shop with our counsellors , " she says . " We all took one treat . Then we hid from the night patrol in the bushes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 3rd stop : Inspection You might be surprised when your mostly messy child comes home from camp and states emphatically that his favourite activity was " cabin inspection . " You can see how this might happen , especially at a camp like Onondaga , in Minden , Ontario , where inspection is more about having kids polish their acting skills than sweep the floor . Each day , counsellors give cabin groups a creative challenge that earns them points . One day , when a counsellor arrived for inspection , a group of eight-year-old boys performed a skit about life in a world made of Jell-O . At Camp Ouareau , a bilingual girls ' camp near St. Donat , Quebec , the camp nurse is in charge of inspecting the cabins . To increase the fun factor , the nurse announces cleanup themes . For the Christmas theme , kids made snowmen out of dirty socks . 4th stop : Dining hall Yes , it is rather loud in here . Although food fights and Jell-O snorting are now taboo , dining halls are still rowdy , says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ emerge at meal-time , so staff will occupy campers with songs , games and tricks . After plates are cleared , kids play hand-clapping table games like 007 and Murder Wink as they wait for announcements . At Kandalore , kids love to play a game that pokes fun at their counsellors . At one planned moment , all campers and staff stand on the dining-hall benches and stare at one pre-chosen , unsuspecting counsellor . Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed Graph Not Transcribed There is also method behind the madness of nonsense songs belted out at mealtime . Onondaga 's dining-hall song " Doh-a-Twinkie " means little to anyone outside the camp . And that 's the point . Anyone who knows the words to " Doh-a-Twinkie "  --  which is the entire camp  --  is included in the same marvellous world , like a members-only club . 5th stop : Canoe trip Many of camp 's most spectacular moments come by virtue of nature 's backdrop . Greg Smith , who has worked five summers as a counsellor and canoe tripper at three different camps , recalls leading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard day 's paddle , his 11-year-old campers perched silently on a rock overlooking the bay . As the sky darkened , the usually hyperkinetic group sat transfixed watching a beaver swim back and forth , gathering sticks for a dam . On canoe trips , kids experience the wonder of time slowing down . " We have time to think about things that we would n't normally , " Smith says . " We make up crazy stories and jokes together . " Andrew Foster , a counsellor who 's led many canoe trips , adds excitement with gags . On one trip he proclaimed a Dr. Seuss day , when campers spoke only " Seussish . " Another time , he paddled the entire trip in a three-piece suit . Sometimes , tripping is hard work . Relationships intensify as kids need to rely on each other . " There 's no escape  --  campers are always together , " Emily Foster explains . " They even have a buddy to go to the bathroom . " When darkness falls , some first-timers imagine ghosts and bears lurking outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also be challenging . But rain-soaked trips make for the best stories , Foster says . " Kids feel a sense of accomplishment. " 6th stop : Bedtime Meanwhile , back at camp , sometimes even the most socially confident children get homesick at night . Jacqui Raill , director of Camp Ouareau , prefers the word " homelonely . " " It 's not a sickness , " she states . " Kids are n't always missing their parents . They may be lonely for their bed , their dog or the privacy in their life . " Most camps have predictable bedtime routines that are comforting to kids . " It 's when we make each camper feel appreciated and loved , " says Mercer of Pioneer Camp . Before sleep , campers share their Roses and Thorns  --  the best and most challenging parts of the day . Especially at camps with younger children , the staff is well prepared for the first night . Some of the six- and seven-year-old campers at Adventure Camp are spending their first night ever away from home . Counsellors run games @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's activities . Finally , they read to the children until the kids fall asleep . " We 're guiding their thoughts , " Bell says . 7th stop : Planet Zerbak ! Often the real magic happens when regular activities are put aside for a day and the entire camp engages in a giant game of capture the flag , or space invaders . At Adventure Camp , the staff " swings on the dining-hall rafters wearing costumes , " says Bell . This introduces the story and theme for the week 's evening programs . When the theme was Hollywood , campers played games and did skits as extras on a movie set . Staff can create another world with nothing but face paint and old costumes . Take Onondaga 's Cattle Battle day . After being told a train carrying herds of cattle had derailed near camp property , the kids spent the day dressed as farmers rounding up " cows " ( counsellors-in-training dressed in black and white ) . " I believe in anything that will help keep a child a child , " says Raill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mascot , Bymph , who is part Brownie and part nymph . " Bymph is like Santa only real , " an eight-year-old camper explains . Every two weeks , Raill weaves Bymph and selected campers into a story . Even older kids consider it to be " really something " if they 're written into the tale , Raill says . " Anyone who does n't believe in Bymph is too old for camp , " explains Sharon Green , an 11-year-old from Ottawa . " He makes camp special . We know he 's always watching even though he 's invisible . At night , we see interesting shadows , and it 's not from the trees . " And on " fairy night , " older campers create magic for younger children at Ouareau . Decked out in wings and sparkles , they wake the campers and lead them by candlelight to a starlit campfire . At Camp Thunderbird west of Victoria , BC , the opening night campfire mysteriously lights by itself . " There are lots of oohs and ahhs , " says camp director David @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Last stop : Home The tour ends here . You may barely recognize your offspring as she steps off the bus , so covered in dirt is she . But once her face splits into what is still a familiar grin , you can overlook her grimy hands and face and the grubby clothes . But , is that ... green dye in her hair ? Anyone who knows the words to " Doh-a-Twinkie "  --  which is the entire camp  --  is included in the same marvellous world , like a members-only club . <p>
