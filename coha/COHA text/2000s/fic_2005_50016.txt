The rain is making this rented tuxedo smell like a wet animal . My sister Rachel and my ex-girlfriend Maggie are standing outside the car while drops fall lightly on their newly done hair and their pink satin bridesmaids dresses . They 're looking at me like I should be unlocking the car , not staring at it from a safe distance . But there 's a form in the way , a purple-orange spot shaped like an exploding dog . If Rachel and Maggie were n't here , I might call it a ghost . But no . It 's only a retinal stain , the kind made by flashbulbs and welding torches and staring at the sun for too long . Still , standing here in the dark liquor-store parking lot holding a brown sack full of booze , I ca n't bring myself to walk towards it . <p> Maggie : What are you waiting for , Garvin ? Unlock the doors . We 're getting soaked . <p> Rachel : How are we going to sneak this booze into the wedding ? <p> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <p> The stain steps through Maggie and disappears by the newspaper stand . <p> I poke my thumbs into my eyelids while I drive . Thunderclouds are hovering over the wet street . The clouds are purple and orange at the same time , two colors that refuse to mix . <p> Maggie : What are you doing ? <p> " Press your thumbs into your eyelids . " <p> Rachel : It hurts . <p> " For God sakes do n't press them that hard . Like this . " <p> Maggie : Jesus , Garvin , watch the road ! <p> " Do you see anything ? " <p> Rachel : Yeah , kind of ... Maybe . Dark spots . <p> Rachel is drinking a bottle of Apple Puckers and jamming her thumb and forefinger into her eyes . Maggie is trying to divide a bottle of Dark Eyes vodka into two bottles of Gatorade without spilling any on her dress . The joint pulses red light around the car like an alarm indicator on a dashboard . A fog of sandalwood hair spray comes from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to spray our heads so that we smell like anything but vodka and Kentucky ditchweed . <p> " If I get really drunk tonight you two promise not to get in the car with me . " I absolve myself in advance with statements like these . <p> Maggie : You guys ' sister is getting married tonight . There 'll be a lot of people happy to drive us home . <p> " How in the shit are you spilling it ? Look how wide the hole is . " <p> Rachel and one of the groomsmen meet in the center of the church . When they reach the third row of pews , Maggie and I walk towards the center . My younger sister , Angie , asked Maggie to be a bridesmaid months ago when we were still dating . It 's awkward now , walking down the aisle with my ex-girlfriend . I try not to think about anything except getting our feet to cooperate . Outside foot-inside foot-do n't think about her-consider it a sobriety test-outside foot-all of the guests are cops-inside foot-even the really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to be physically restrained from playing in the holy water-outside foot-now part-now stand-now stop swaying like a drunk elephant-stop-be still-still-still . Do n't look at Angie walking down the aisle , and do n't look at your old man trying not to cry . Do n't look at Rachel , and whatever you do , do n't look at Maggie . Be still-still-still . Look at the burning candles and the yellow flowers . <p> White ribbons are tied to the basketball goals . The lights are low . Apparently , the lady trimming the roast went to high school with my mother . <p> Mom : Do n't be silly , Kelly , there are so many people at this wedding from the class of ' 77 . Let them cut their own roast . How often do we all have a chance to get together ? <p> Kelly : It 's my job . You ca n't trust a buffet line with a sharp knife . <p> I can tell Mom feels bad about not inviting her , even though they have n't talked in years . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plates for a helping of roast . When they reach to shake her hand , she holds up rubber gloves covered in bloody juice as if to say " Are you sure ? " I take a picture of them at the end of the buffet line with one of the disposable cameras . No photographer was hired , the only pictures will come from the disposable cameras given to the guests as they walked through the door . Angie followed some advice from a popular magazine and asked herself , " Of the three most important aspects of a wedding , dress , flowers , and photography , which is the most important , and where can I find creative money-saving alternatives ? " She decided that flowers were the most important , and that photography was the least . <p> I take a picture of my ten-year-old cousin Curtis , who is dancing very enthusiastically to " Little Red Corvette . " Uncle Jay grabs the disposable camera on his table and flashes it a couple of times right in my eyes . <p> Jay : How do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . <p> " Fuck you . " <p> We pop flashes back and forth like dueling cowboys . I see the ghost . The ghost . We are laughing now . He takes the flask out of his jacket pocket and adds whiskey to both our soft drinks . <p> Jay : Jesus drank wine . These Southern Baptists ca n't dispute that . Ca n't we just agree on that and have a drink at a wedding without having to sneak it under our coats like teenagers ? Get a picture of this . <p> I snap a photo as Jay opens his coat , holds the silver flask up halfway out of his liner pocket , and looks over his shoulder to see who 's within earshot . <p> Jay : It 's prom night , and I 'm going to pop my sweetheart 's cherry . <p> Young Curtis has commanded a small space for himself in the middle of the dance floor . The swirling red and blue lights on the DJ booth move in and out of the three-point line and on and off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over one of his shoulders and prances around the court , swinging his hips like a church bell . His stepfather takes a long drink . <p> Jay : I told that boy it 's all right to dance . But a man holds something back , unless you 're John Travolta or something . Can you imagine how much wool that guy gets ? The rest of us , the teachers and the plumbers and the lawyers , we all got ta hold most of it back . Now look at him , he 's miming the goddamn song , driving down the highway in his little red corvette . You 've got to believe me , Garvin , I never touched that boy or done anything to make him like this . And I would kill someone dead if I found out they ... People think that . Especially because I 'm his stepfather . They say " Curt did n't start acting ' like he does ' until Norma married Jay . " <p> " Nobody thinks that . " <p> Jay : Yeah , well , your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him to the Cracker Barrel after mass to ask him if I ever touched him funny . <p> He burps and puts his fingers to his lips as if he might vomit . Angie 's new in-laws whisper and stare at us indiscreetly . Jay slides the flask into my tuxedo jacket pocket . <p> Jay : I 'm not giving you this flask . I 'm just letting you borrow it till the whiskey 's gone . I 'm cutting myself off . Who do people think I am ? Am I the only one in this whole darn world that knows I 'm a good person ? Or am I just the only one who thinks it ? Are you the only one ? I love that boy , in the natural way that a father loves his son . No matter what . People in this town need a reason for everything , someone or something to point their figurative fingers at . God makes faggots just like he makes horses and all the different kinds of birds . <p> I do n't have the nerve to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tie is pinched in the fatty fold between his gut and his tits . I take a picture of his drink instead . The Easter purple plastic cup is sitting on the table next to one of the centerpieces . A shrub of violet flowers is floating in a clear glass bowl . Clean roots float in the water like a jellyfish . A blue Betta Fish is nibbling on its tentacles . Fins swirl like blue dye that never dissolves . <p> " If it makes you feel better , Hugo 's daughter , Wendy , likes to be suspended by shark hooks they poke through her skin . " <p> Jay : What ? <p> " They poke shark hooks through holes in her skin , holes that have healed over like pierced earlobes . Only the holes are n't in her ears , they 're in her back and knees and probably other places . They put these shark hooks through the holes and then hoist her up with an elaborate pulley system some guy built in his backyard . At least that 's the way I understand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . <p> " I swore I would n't tell . " <p> Jay : Is it a sex thing ? <p> " To hear her tell it , it 's a **36;1664;TOOLONG kind of thing . " <p> Jay : Where can we go from here , Garvin ? This goddamn world , it only gets crazier . What 's next ? You 're a young man , tell me what the heck is next . When I was young we would neck for hours and go home fully satisfied . <p> " Do n't cry , Jay . Please . I told you that to make you feel better . " <p> Jay : It does make me feel better in a weird kind of way . Thanks ... What in the hell would make someone want to hoist themselves up by shark hooks ? " <p> " Hell if I know . " <p> Jay : I should take her to the Cracker Barrel and ask her . <p> I take pictures of the flowers because they 'll be dead soon . <p> I take pictures of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the kids dominating the limbo contest . <p> I take a picture of Rachel 's son , Sam , lapping out of the punch bowl like a golden retriever . <p> Rachel is sitting in the back corner of the gym . Children gather around her at the aluminum table . They are taking picture after picture of a glass centerpiece with one blue Betta Fish darting around the bowl and one red one , with no eyes and a bite-sized absence of head , swimming aimlessly into the glass . <p> Rachel : These fish ca n't stand each other . I do n't know how they ever fuck . I named the blue one Shirley . She does n't take any shit from anyone . <p> She scoops a red fish into a plastic cup , holds the cup a foot above Shirley 's bowl , and dumps it from , what must seem to a fish completely unfamiliar with the concept of free-fall , an unimaginable height . They slash around until Shirley makes her stand in the middle of the bowl . The red fish is named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt " by Curtis , who deems " Jaws " trite and uninspired . Roosevelt avoids Shirley for a while , keeping tight to the glass . He is trying to adjust and gather strength after being poured from the water that tasted like himself into the water that tastes like his enemy . The red and blue disco lights from the DJ booth pass through the bowl . <p> DJ : This one is a request . From Rachel to Shirley . <p> Rachel grabs my cup and takes a long drink . The speakers play : I 'm holding out for a hero/I 'm holding out for a hero till the end of the night/He 's got to be fast/And he 's got to be strong/And he 's got to be fresh from the fight . Rachel sings along and taps her fingers on the table . Her taste in music is ridiculous for a nineteen-year-old-girl . She only likes the songs that chew their way into her brain like a worm . Mostly pop and commercial jingles . The songs are like screen savers for her mind . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being poured out of his own bowl into a completely new one . " <p> Rachel : But Shirley is getting tired . She has already killed four lesser fish . <p> I take a picture of the table . There is one bowl in the middle where everyone 's attention and disposable camera is fixed . There are six empty bowls scattered at the far end and a pile of dying flowers with roots like Asian noodles . At the near end of the table , five brave Betta Fish have been arranged in an impeccable row . <p> Curtis : I bet six dollars on Roosevelt . <p> Rachel : You 're on , Twinkle Toes . <p> Maggie and I slow-dance to an old Gene Autry song that my grandfather requested . The cowboy is lonely , and the woman is beautiful . That 's the gist of the song . She might be a whore , but Gene Autry could never come out and say it . I 'm too drunk to pay attention to the lyrics . I pay attention to the sliding notes , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of me . The cowboy is good . He ca n't go anywhere without an Injun trying to rip his scalp off . He killed a race of people in self-defense . People will believe anything if you tell them enough times . <p> " I love you , Maggie . " <p> Maggie : I love you , too . <p> The last picture I take is of Rachel , stumbling through the double doors under the basketball goal , wiping white spit from her mouth . I ask her what 's wrong , and she asks me if I have ever seen one of my close friends eaten alive . I tell her that I have not , and I put my camera in the cardboard box with the others . I imagine my father and Angie sitting around the kitchen table organizing the photos . I wonder if Angie will cry when she finds out that seventy percent of her wedding pictures are of bloody fish . I wonder which of my pictures will make it to the album and which ones she will throw away . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath . " I 'm patting myself down like a lunatic . These tuxedos have so many pockets . I find my keys in some strange pocket within a pocket . <p> Maggie : Can we stop by the Bigfoot so I can get a microwave burrito ? <p> Rachel : I need some gum . I barfed in the graveyard . <p> Maggie : You barfed in the graveyard ? <p> Rachel : Uh-huh . Can you believe they had their reception in a church gymnasium ? Can you believe the DJ , he was awful . He kept talking all the time , congratulating everybody and trying to make people dance . I 'm the one with the baby , Garvin . Do you think Angie got married first because she secretly hates me ? <p> " How can you say things like that ? Get out of the car while I back out ? Make sure I do n't run over any kids . " <p> Rachel : It 's raining . What about my dress ? <p> " Are you ever going to wear that thing again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I just do n't want to run over any kids . Say it will be your fault , or go outside and make sure I do n't hit one . " <p> Maggie : You guys are being ridiculous . <p> Rachel : My son left early with his grandparents . <p> " So you 're saying , ' Somebody else 's kid getting run over is n't worth ruining my stupid pink dress . ' " <p> Rachel : Do n't put words in my mouth . <p> " Then say it will be your fault if I run a kid over . " <p> Rachel : No . <p> " I ca n't look and back up at the same time . " <p> Rachel : Sure you can . <p> " What I meant was I ca n't go outside and really-see . It 's dark and rainy behind me . Just somebody please go , or a little kid 's going to get run over and it wo n't be my fault . " <p> Maggie : Jesus Christ , I 'll go look . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . I look out over the graveyard as we back up , modest stones on a black hill that rolls easily down to cornfields and subdivisions . It 's where I will be buried if I die too soon . Maggie motions me to stop and gets back in the car . <p> Rachel : Is Angie trying to set a good example or something ? <p> Maggie : Me ? I 'm damned if I do , et cetera . <p> Rachel : I 'm not talking about you , I said Angie , not Maggie . <p> " What do you mean by good example ? " <p> Rachel : She 's not even twenty , and she 's not even pregnant . I do n't ever want to get married . I want to live with Mom and Dad and take care of them when they get old . <p> Maggie : Then who 's going to take care of you when you get old ? <p> Rachel : My son . . . or probably a nursing home . . . hopefully better than the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you 're able , Garvin , would you kill me if it comes to that bad point and I do n't have the physical capabilities to do it myself ? I do n't want you to do it if you have a family and it could fuck things up . But if you can do it without getting caught , or if you 're as miserable as I am , will you promise to do it ? <p> " I 'm not promising anything . " <p> Rachel : Every day I go to work I see those old people hooked up to vents and the ones that can only groan with their heads turned towards the wall . I just do n't love them enough to kill ' em . But I love you enough . <p> Garvin : Should I be flattered or terrified ? <p> Rachel : Comforted . <p> Maggie : I want to be in a death pact . Garvin , do you love me enough to kill me ? <p> " I loved you enough to kill you that first night we slept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we woke up stuck to each other . " <p> Maggie : Aw . The hot and sticky good old days . <p> The light is red . I tap my thumbs on the steering wheel . Life is not like a movie . Nothing we say means anything . I 'm telling myself this more and more lately . I 'm like an old Catholic immigrant who looks for signs everywhere . Except I do n't believe they 're signs from God . I believe that I am watching myself in a movie and that if I pay attention I can guess the outcome . I am evaluating myself , as well as everyone else in the car . Sometimes I feel like the hero of my own life , and sometimes I feel like the new guy on the Starship Enterprise that does n't stand a chance . A car full of drunk kids driving down dark country roads on a wet moonless night making death pacts must crash , and if there are three people in the car , one must die . Would it be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who saw a ghost , or the one who it walked right through ? If I were watching this movie I would predict Rachel to die . Why else would she be here ? She inhibits the romantic tension between Maggie and me . Can we find a new way to love each other ? That is what this story would be about if my little sister were n't in the car . Then again , why would anybody give a shit about Maggie and me , unless we were played by two ber-beautiful movie stars ? Maggie is beautiful , but not like a movie star . Her gums are too big , and her teeth are too small . And I 've got character actor written all over my face . Rachel is the only one in the car who has suffered enough to make people care about her real self . The scar , spread like putty from the top of her lip to the bottom of her nose , proves it . When people find out how she got that scar , her story becomes a burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows it casts . The dominant past is welded to her face . She is the only one that 's safe . But I am driving the car . If I die , the audience misses out on all that great , torturous guilt . The real thick drama . The scene where I bring flowers to the grave , throw myself on the mound , and rub the new loose dirt on my only suit . I guess that leaves Maggie . Poor dead Maggie . There are no clues about what 's coming next . Sure , we are in a higher-risk category than completely sober people right now . But the deaths in the papers are all crazy drunks going one hundred and six miles an hour . I 'm a sad drunk . I am driving five miles an hour under the speed limit because the road is wet and I might have seen a ghost . There is no moral to life . We are certainly not going to die because we want to show people how dangerous it is to drink and drive . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or the Virgin Mary , or any kind of warning . It is what happens when brightness burns . I remember staring at the sun when I was twelve . I wanted to burn my eyes out . It was like God himself was daring me to do it . I like the idea that my life is like a movie . I wish I could believe it . But foreshadowing is n't real . The idea that randomness and luck are the only two forces in the universe is the scariest idea I 've ever let surface . Or do the words " randomness " and " luck " represent a lack of force ? What does that mean ? A foggy ache settles over my brain . The light turns green , and we roll through the intersection . <p> Maggie : Did you puke on a specific grave ? <p> Rachel : Yep-Ira Head . <p> " Do you think his soul will haunt you ? " <p> Rachel : No , he 's not even dead yet . Just his wife , Noreen . I puked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , that 's not so bad . <p> Life is not like a movie . <p> Maggie : Pull over , Garvin , I 'm going to pee in my pants . <p> I pull into a cornfield , and Maggie disappears into the stalks holding her dress up around her waist . I roll my window down and let the smell of happy corn with wet roots fill the car . I put my cufflink into my pocket and roll my left sleeve up as far as it will go . I hang my arm out the window and let the drizzle hit my skin . <p> Rachel : Turn down the radio . Let 's see if we can hear her pee . <p> She rolls her window down and lights a cigarette . All around us there is water , rushing through a ditch and falling from the sky . <p> Rachel : It sounds like she really had to go . <p> " I 'm almost sure that 's the rain . " <p> Rachel : Do you think anyone will want to marry me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody good , though , huh ? <p> " It all depends on what you consider ' good . ' It 's about where you put your emphasis . " <p> Rachel : What do you mean ? <p> " It 's economic . You 're worth so much based on your attributes : looks , intelligence , sincerity , money , general coolness-everything . Then you get to choose a person based on your personal worth . It 's like buying a car . You have a price range . You choose what kind of car you want within that price range . Do you want comfort or speed ? Usually it 's someplace between . " <p> Rachel : Do you mean that I could find a really nice guy who treated me good , but he might be boring , or ugly , or stupid , or something ? Or I could find a really hot guy who will probably be a shithead because a guy who is hot and nice is out of my price range ? <p> " It 's a little more complicated than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You should n't sell yourself short . There are a lot of sturdy cars in your price range . " <p> Rachel : What kind of car am I ? <p> " You 're my sister . It 's hard for me to think of you as a car . " <p> Rachel : Not by blood . <p> " How many times do you want me to say that does n't matter ? Another hundred million ? " <p> Rachel : Well , if you had to say . Pretend you 're someone else so you can say . <p> " Used , probably . " <p> Rachel : Well , then , you 're a chubby car with a big head . <p> " Most cars are used . All of ' em , maybe . " <p> Rachel : What kind of car is Maggie ? " <p> " She 's a three-year-old Maxima with twenty-eight thousand miles on her . " <p> Rachel : What kind of interior does she have ? <p> " Leather . Decent factory sound . " <p> Rachel : Are you two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me that I 'm thinking about her like she 's a car . I was hoping you would tell me that I was wrong . You 're supposed to tell me it 's more-something else . " <p> Rachel : Do you think big fake tits would help my resale value ? <p> " I really loved her at first , and she really loved me back . It was the first time it happened that way . I was so happy that I do n't like to think about it . " <p> Rachel : Like great big custom wheels . <p> " They 're not for everyone , but there 's certainly a market for that kind of thing . " <p> Rachel : I hope Sam is waiting up for me . <p> " It 's twelve-thirty at night . " <p> Rachel : I hope that he ca n't sleep without a kiss from his mother . <p> Maggie 's heels stab into the mud with every step to the car . She offers Rachel the front seat . She declines . I consider it a life-ordeath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smooth stop before I can get into second gear . A black milk cow with a white exclamation mark on her head is standing in the middle of the road . <p> " That thing is pitch fucking black . " We have been saved by the purple-orange spot burned into the back of my eyes . <p> Rachel : Is it sleeping ? <p> Maggie : Do n't look at me , I 'm from Chicago Heights . <p> I drive around the cow and turn my high beams on . We pass the clicking sprinklers of the golf course and then old farmhouses , with newer ones built in between . Ancient trees line up along Darmstadt Road like soldiers who create a canopy of swords for an officer and his new bride to walk under . <p> Maggie : We might have hit that cow if I did n't have to stop to pee . It was all black besides that mark on its head . <p> " It was standing fifty yards in front of us the whole time we were talking , and I never saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to hear you complain about me stopping to pee again . I 'll say , Honey , remember when stopping to pee saved our lives . <p> " I saw something strange at the liquor store earlier . It was like a sunspot-ghost . " <p> Maggie : I believe in angels . I 've seen one . <p> " It was a sunspot . Like the spot that 's left when a camera flashes and you close your eyes , except bigger and moving . <p> Rachel : I heard a voice as we were walking to the car . <p> " What did it say ? " <p> Rachel : Groooowwwwwlllll ! <p> Maggie : It was probably an angel that was sent down to warn us about the cow . I only believe in angels , not ghosts . <p> Rachel : Baloney shit . <p> Maggie : I do n't care if you believe me . It does n't make it any less true . <p> Rachel : How can you believe in angels and not unfriendly ghosts ? <p> Maggie : I do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good people and the bad people both die in the end . It only makes sense that there are good and bad ghosts , if there are ghosts at all . <p> Maggie : Only bad people die for real . <p> Rachel : I wish I could choose what I believe in . I 'd believe in a heaven where I go to water slide parks with the cast of Friends , and they 're all just how they are on the show . <p> Maggie : Heaven and Hell are tailor-made for each individual person . So , you know , anything is possible . We ca n't know . <p> Rachel : What if the cast of Friends ' idea of heaven is n't going to a water slide park with me ? Or being just how they are on the show ? Or if they 're in Hell ? Or if I 'm in Hell ? <p> Maggie : God could make a new cast of friends just for you to play with . <p> Rachel : A fake heaven ? <p> Maggie : Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a ghost . Any ghost .

I pull to the side of the road . Maggie steps out of the car without looking and slides into a ditch . She takes her shoes off , and I pull her up the bank . <p> A shirtless teenage boy is standing over a cow lying in the middle of the road .

Do one of you have a mint or a piece of gum , or a penny-does that work ? <p> Maggie : I have a cigarette . <p> Elmer : That might help ... Hello , nine-one-one , this is no emergency . I just need the number for the police station and I 'm on a cellphone in the middle of the country so I got no way to look it up ... I guess I could 've dialed information ... How many emergencies can happen in Evansville , Indiana , one night ? Do n't act like you 're too busy to patch me through ... Police @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I hit a cow ... I 'm fine ... No , I do n't need a ambulance ... Yeah , I 'm on Kilgore and St. Johns ... <p> There is a red stripe across his chest where the seat belt saved his life . When the police get here and I 'm still a little drunk , they will have to let it go because I would have never been caught if I did n't pull over to help somebody out . Will Elmer 's father hug him , or punch him , or ignore him completely ? I imagine his mother arriving in her nightgown , which is really just a giant Tshirt with an airbrushed Tasmanian devil in his own nightgown , sound asleep . Bugs Bunny is tied up like a turkey in his dream cloud . She smokes Doral Menthols and hugs her son so hard that she jars something loose in her lungs . <p> Maggie : We can give you a ride to the hospital . <p> " That 's no problem at all . I would be happy to do it . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cellphone . <p> Elmer : I 'm fine ! I 'm walking around . I got a dip and a cigarette in my mouth ... One more thing is , this cow is pretty bad , I figure I should go ahead and finish her off , but I just wanted to run it by you all ... I do n't know who it belongs to ... They 've got me on hold . <p> The cow groans , and Maggie groans with sympathy for the cow . <p> Elmer : I got a gun locked in my toolbox ... I got my permit ... It 's awful to keep her alive ... What do you mean you ca n't authorize it , you 're the police , sir , are n't you ? ... I do n't know whose cow it is ... Well , what kind of charges could he decide to press ? The brand must have been on the part of her that 's smeared on the road ... How soon ? All right . " <p> Maggie : What did they say ? <p> Elmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know what the fuck to do . This ca n't be the first time this has happened . <p> He lies down in the truck bed . He turns his head and spits on the bed liner . The truck reminds me of a civil war bullet I found on a hike with the Boy Scouts , flat in the front like it hit something hard . I walk to the ditch and take a long beautiful piss into the cattails . <p> Maggie : Call them back and tell them that all the cow 's legs are broken and that his intestines are all over the road . <p> The cow groans . <p> Elmer : She 's close . Every moment of agony is unnecessary . <p> Elmer turns his head and spits . Maggie lights a cigarette . <p> " Why do n't you call your folks back and tell them to meet us at the hospital . I 'll drive you . " <p> Elmer : You ? You 're just as drunk as I am and look what happened to me . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not getting in the car with nobody that 's been drinking . I may not drink neither myself , never . My folks are on their way . <p> " All this has got me pretty well sobered up . " <p> Elmer : Well , you smell like whiskey . I believe you get a warning shot for this kind of thing , and I learned my lesson . No more drinking , period . And I 'm not the kind of person that says he 's going to do something and does n't do it . <p> He folds his hands and looks up at the stars ; with just a crack of moon and only road flares lighting the earth , they are bright . The rain is gone ; I ca n't remember when it stopped . <p> Elmer : I 'm givin ' my life to you , Iesus . It 's belonged to me too long , and I have done nothin ' but screw it up . <p> When the cow groans again Maggie starts to cry . <p> Elmer : Do you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a historical sense ? <p> Elmer : " Historical sense . " Are you being some kind of smart-ass ? Is that some kind of satanic joke ? <p> " Look , we did n't have to stop and help . " <p> Elmer : Help who ? You , help me ? That 's a laugh . <p> A pair of headlights rolls over the hill . A blue minivan . The driver pulls gently around the flares and rolls down his window . It is too dark inside the car to see his face . <p> Driver : You kids all right ? <p> Elmer : Yep . My folks and the police are on the way . <p> Driver : Hit a cow , huh ? <p> Elmer : Yep . <p> Driver : How far you figure you knocked her ? <p> Elmer : ' Bout twenty-six yards . <p> Driver : Let 's see one of those Princeton , Indiana , Jap trucks do that . <p> He rolls up his window and drives away . Elmer lies back down in the bed of his truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naked eye . <p> Elmer : Look at the stars . Are you trying to say that there 's not something up there shining down on us ? The first man on earth looked up there , and he knew it . My dad 's going to shit fire ' bout the truck , but he 's going to be happy I found the Lord . <p> The cow groans , and Maggie walks to the car . I follow her . <p> " Are you okay ? " <p> When we get inside she rolls up all the windows . <p> Maggie : I ca n't listen to that fucking cow anymore , and that fucking guy is n't helping . <p> " I know . It 's awful . " <p> Maggie : Let 's go , Garvin . He 's fine . <p> " It never crossed my mind that someone else would hit it . I would have tried to move the cow , or I would have called the sheriff , or somebody whose job it is ... It 's our fault . " <p> Maggie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's been to the same school assemblies as all the rest of us . It 's his own fucking fault . I saw it coming . I thought " Somebody could hit that cow " but then I thought " Who the hell would be speedin ' down St. Johns at one-thirty at night " and then I thought " Drunk kids , that 's who . " But I still did n't say anything . I just did n't . If it 's anybody 's fault it 's his fault , and if it 's nobody 's fault it 's my fault . But he 's fine so I do n't think we should ever think or talk about this again . <p> " We 're here now . We 're the only ones here . And we ca n't leave until we know he 's fine . He could have some sort of internal injury . " <p> Maggie : Fine . But I 'm staying in the car . <p> " I should 've seen it , too . I 'm sorry . It was a logical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Where the fuck are they ? <p> " Do you have your cellphone ? I 'm going to call and explain the urgency of the situation . " <p> Maggie : What are you going to tell them ? <p> " I 'm going to tell them that he 's disoriented and that he does n't seem as well as he claims to be . And I 'm going to call 911 . Anything that will get them to hurry . " <p> Maggie : Mine is dead . Borrow his phone . Garvin ! Tell him to be careful with his cigarette . There might be gas . <p> When I open the door Maggie pulls it shut behind me and yells " Hurry ! " through the glass . Elmer 's feet dangle off of the tailgate . I imagine the truck exploding as I 'm walking towards it . A big movie explosion . The thought of flying glass makes me rub my eyes . His cigarette is dead in his fingers . His pudgy belly is moving up and down , a few loose hairs surround his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . I take the cellphone out of his pocket and call 911 . <p> Operator : 911 Emergency . <p> " We need an ambulance . We called the police earlier . What happened was , this teenage boy hit this cow and he seemed fine for a while . " <p> Operator : Is he conscious ? <p> " No . " <p> Operator : Is he breathing ? <p> " Yes . " <p> Operator : Have you tried waking him up ? <p> " Yes . " <p> Operator : What did you do ? <p> " I tapped his knee . " <p> Operator : That 's it ? <p> " I did n't know what to do when I called . " <p> Operator : Scream his name . <p> " I do n't know his name . " <p> Operator : Then just scream . <p> A giant sense of relief and embarrassment fills me . As soon as I yell " Wake up ! " He 'll be fine . He seems to be grinning now a little , like this is all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wake up ! ... Wake up ! ... Wake up ! " <p> Operator : Where are you located ? <p> " St. Johns , about a half mile before the giant peach . " <p> Operator : An ambulance is on the way . <p> " They should be on the road . ' Where are you located ' should be the first question you ask . " <p> Operator : Was there any response at all ? <p> " Did you not believe me when I said I needed an ambulance ? They could be halfway down First Avenue . Tell them to turn the fucking lights on ! " <p> Operator : You should have told me where you were first thing , sir . <p> " You 're the fucking operator guy . Fuck ! " <p> Operator : I know . I know . I 'm sorry . I 'm new . It 's all my fault . Just answer the questions . Is he still breathing ? <p> " Yes . He looks like he 's sleeping . " <p> Operator : Very important . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another car shine over the hill . I leave the chirping operator on his chest , and I run back to the car . <p> Maggie : What 's happening ? <p> I tell her , " We 're not supposed to touch him , " and we drive away . <p> Author Affiliation
