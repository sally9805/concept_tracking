. PRO-LINE packs 38 years of center console know-how into its new 29 GRAND SPORT . I 'VE FISHED A LOT OF PRO-LINES OVER THE YEARS , but the new Grand Sport stopped me dead in my tracks . It seemed too big to be a 29 , and as I was to learn , it not only looks much larger , it handles that way , too . The Grand Sport was docked on Florida 's beautiful Crystal River , and waiting with it was Dan Atwood , who is still at the helm of Pro-Line , the company he founded in 1968 The hull had a graceful , almost elegant sheer , a real departure from the straight lines of her predecessors . For this builder , the Grand Sport is the culmination of four decades of designing and popularizing center console fishing boats . " Welcome aboard , " said Atwood . " Take a look around while we finish rigging some tackle . " The plan was to troll for grouper as part of our morning on the water . Tall in the bow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foredeck gunwales are almost chest high . Padded bolsters make comfortable backrests when seated . The wide console , with room for a full complement of electronics , offers lots of protection behind its curved windshield , and the face is hinged to provide instant access to wiring and harnesses . A big , fiberglass T-top incorporates a radio box , outrigger mounts and PFD storage . Helm seating is combined with a 50-gallon , above-deck live well , tackle drawers and rigging room on easy-to-clean Starboard surfaces . On either side of the helm is a tuna-sized , 130-gallon , in-deck fish box . A deck hatch aft provides bilge access and additional storage . On the gunwales aft are four aluminum rod holders and on the engine bracket there 's a pair of neatly plumbed Mercury Verado outboards . This entire package reflects all that Atwood and the engineers at Pro-Line have learned over the years . The Mercury digital controls slipped the supercharged engines into gear with nary a sound and we idled down the river , past manatees playing and a tarpon rolling on the surface . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ include marsh grasses and exotic birds . The boat rose on plane and glided to a cruise of 32 mph , burning 18.2 gph . The power steering for the twin 200-hp Verados made input from the helm effortless while providing positive feedback to the wheel . Running at wide-open throttle , speed was just under 45 mph . ( Since my test , the boat has been tweaked , and Pro-Line reports top speed is now 48 mph . ) We wasted no time getting to a wreck , where we dropped a pair of Stretch plugs into the wake . We counted down the seconds before the plugs reached their target . It was like clockwork as the first rod went down , a tasty gag grouper struggling on the other end . We put it on ice in one of the fish boxes ; before long , that fish had company . Running the Grand Sport back toward Crystal River , I realized it could be the most family friendly boat in its class . All that freeboard provides security for kids aboard ; there 's a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interior and a roomy head compartment in the center console . The 29 Grand Sport is definitely not your father 's Pro-Line , but rather the first shot fired by Atwood and the company in redefining the center console , yet again . This article contains a table .
