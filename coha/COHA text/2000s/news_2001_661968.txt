The jar of Jamaican jerk sauce is tucked away in the shopping cart - right under the British oatmeal , the Indonesian sambal , the Greek grape leaves and the Spanish pickled olives . And just as Dale Wiemer comes around the corner of the aisle with the white millet , his wife checks her laser-printed list and scowls . <p> " I got the mango puree , " Katie Wiemer says . " But we forgot to write down the soba noodles . " <p> Across the floor , international produce manager Chris Stoll is on the Internet , downloading e-mailed photos of green-grape orders from Chile . In meat , the butchers are setting out fresh duck feet and beef hooves - bargains at $1.10 and $1.79 a pound . Down in Hispanic foods , the turbaned gentleman is loading up on the Goya pinto beans . And along the 75-foot wall of beers , the Asian couple is discussing whether to buy the big bottle of Chimay Ale , brewed in Belgium by Trappist monks . <p> Tough decisions . But mornings can be like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're shopping at the wacky , worldly-wise supermarket known as Jungle Jim 's International Farmers Market . <p> Once , the food on American tables came from the corner grocer , the neighborhood butcher and baker - and , beyond that , from fields and slaughterhouses across the land . That was before the world stitched itself together into a big planetary smorgasbord . <p> Today , sprawling over four acres north of Cincinnati , Jungle Jim 's is the endpoint of a staggering global network of farmers , suppliers , producers and distributors . Each day , the gates of its loading docks roll open to take in a universe far beyond La Choy and Old El Paso - a whopping 110,000 different products , fresh and canned , boxed and frozen , shipped in from all over . <p> And the customers stream in from miles around , from two , three , four states away . They jam the aisles on weekends in Indian saris and Muslim veils and Yoruba caps , forming a frenzy of international bumper carts . Some drive all day to get here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't begin to spell , much less eat . Ghee and rambutan and longan , kimchi and nopalitos and durian . <p> Some customers - America 's meat-and-potatoes faithful - come seeking the offbeat , the tasty , the exotic . Others - the newer Americans and tomorrow 's citizens - are looking for home . <p> The world gets smaller . Minds grow broader . Dinner is served . <p> This is how the world has changed : " It 's not too many stores you 'd find lichees on sale with a 50-case display , " says Tom Hann , Jungle Jim 's international foods manager . <p> This is how America has changed : " We do n't have our sheep heads , we 're in big trouble on the weekend , " says marketing manager Sarah Baumann . <p> And this is how metropolitan Cincinnati has changed , according to Jungle Jim himself , Jim Bonaminio : " We used to get complaints from international customers that our cashiers were looking at their fish heads funny . Now everyone 's accustomed to ' em . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're an immigrant nation , after all . Supermarkets have been expanding their international sections gradually for more than two decades as more Americans travel abroad - and beyond Europe - and return with culinary tales and adventurous gastrointestinal tracts . <p> " People are seeing these not as distant countries , but as available ones , " says Dave Schnerr , the manager of wine and beer . <p> Younger Americans who dine out in ethnic restaurants want to try their hand at home . Partly because of this , the National Restaurant Association says it now considers Italian , Mexican and Chinese cuisines part of the mainstream - " so ingrained in American culture that they are no longer foreign to the American palate . " <p> But technological progress during the past 10 years - everything from telecommunications to improved refrigeration and pest-killing techniques - has gone beyond merely creating the market for global foodstuffs ; it has made that world possible . At the same time , multinational corporations are importing legions of skilled workers to jobs in the United States . <p> Such changes blur the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Wiemer family . <p> Twice a year , armed with their voluminous shopping list , they make the six-hour drive from Swansea , Ill . They tasted the world during their 10-country honeymoon , and have since added China , Greece , Mexico and Egypt . Each place produced previously unprobed palate preferences . <p> Topping their list : Japanese-style breadcrumbs ( " They 're crispier " ) ; diced Mexican chipotles in adobo sauce ; and green mangoes for a friend from Laos . <p> " In St. Louis , you might find an Asian store or an Indian store , but you ca n't go to one place , " Katie Wiemer says . <p> Such smaller groceries typically cater to specific ethnicities and a small cadre of intrepid cooks ; mainstream American shoppers , though , can be uneasy about venturing beyond supermarkets to such smaller emporiums . <p> " You never knew how long the item had been sitting there . There was some element of perceived risk , " says Arun Jain , a University at Buffalo professor who studies supermarket retailing . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confidence . " <p> When Hann came to Jungle Jim 's two decades ago , international foods sections were typically about 4 feet long and stocked with preposterously priced irrelevancies . " It was somebody 's idea of gourmet , " he recalls . " It was n't food you were supposed to eat . " <p> Today , Jungle Jim 's stocks more than 20,000 items either imported from overseas or sold with an eye toward international tastes - everything from Song Hee broccoli ( China ) to bottles of Slavutych Beer ( Ukraine ) . Products from Thailand , India , Japan and Chinese regions like Szechuan are particularly popular . Even black bear leg roast and duck prosciutto are available - at $21.99 a pound each . <p> Cumin ? It 's sold ground - and also whole , for Mexicans , who prefer it that way . Rice ? Choose any of 22 kinds from around the world , some in 80-pound bags . Hot sauces ? The number of varieties just topped 1,000 . And miso - fermented Japanese soybean paste ? Seventeen different styles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asian fruit that , the saying goes , " smells like hell but tastes like heaven . " Jungle Jim 's has it , sold frozen , to neutralize the odor . <p> Presentation , too , suggests a diverse clientele . Fish is sold two ways - filleted , for Americans , and whole , with innards intact , for shoppers of other ethnic traditions who consider that fresher . And pork : While Americans like thick chops , Asian tastes run toward the thin . And while root vegetables like yuca , yam and taro are typically laid on the ground to be sold in many lands , not so Ohio ; the health department says no . The compromise : a bottom shelf just above the floor . <p> Midwestern Cincinnati , with its tradition of old-world European immigrants , may seem an odd place for Jungle Jim 's , but it 's more diverse than it seems . Though it remains predominantly white , it is brimming with multinational operations , including Procter &; Gamble , Mitsubishi , Bayer , Siemens and Toyota . The region exports @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many communities happens here : More foreign presence means more American contact with foreigners . And after that , the easiest way for " mainstream Americans " to explore foreign culture is often through food . <p> " I sometimes call it ' ethnicity lite , " ' says Marilyn Halter , author of " Shopping For Identity : The Marketing of Ethnicity . " <p> " Food becomes sort of a bridge between cultures - and a safe bridge , " she says . " There 's not that much risk in trying kimchi , but it 's more exposure than if you never tried it at all . " <p> " You want a peanut ? " says Jim Bonaminio , known simply as " Jungle . " When a visitor refuses , he breaks out his other stash - Gummi Bears stored in a crockery pot marked " Boogers . " <p> The silver-haired Bonaminio , 51 , launched Jungle Jim 's in 1975 as an expansion of a roadside produce stand . Today , he oversees a domain four times the size of the average supermarket . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A machine for fresh tortillas ! A military-style restaurant made from old Desert Storm scrap ! A monorail ! <p> You think he 's kidding ? The blueprints are on his desk . <p> It takes a quirky mind to build such a profitable paean to productdom , and Bonaminio relishes the role . As " Jungle , " he dons a pith helmet and loud shirt , then rides a scooter up and down aisles to greet customers . <p> " People say , ' Thank you for having this store , " ' he says . " I could n't imagine a life of saying , ' Yeah , man , I have 10 grocery stores and I sell Clorox cheap . " ' <p> Customer demand drives growth . " A Chinese woman walked in and said , ' I want Napa , ' so we got Napa . And it just kept evolving that way , " says Phill Adams , a longtime Jungle Jim 's employee whose duties include managing the sprawling deli and cheese operation . It does business with 125 different vendors ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and purveys 1,600 cheeses from 20 nations . <p> International foods is even more intricate : 300 vendors , many of them family businesses - a United Nations of Food , which is a favorite saying around here . One Asian supplier is second-generation American ; his father came from Taiwan in 1950 . A Chicago-based South Asian food broker still owns farms in India . <p> " You learn something about the world every day , " says Paul Fischesser , an international food buyer . Both he and Hann are constantly being fed by customers wielding plastic containers of homeland concoctions made from a Jungle Jim ingredient , be it Jufran Banana Ketchup or Mork Dark Syrup . <p> " I 'm a firm believer that you have to taste it to sell it . You ca n't be afraid to try something , " Hann says . " The worst that happens is you spit it out . " <p> Despite its novel approach ( a tiny theater tells Jungle Jim 's " story " in a short video ) , the store is not a novelty ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discuss sales numbers , everyone talks of " pinpoint research " that minimizes waste and overpurchasing by analyzing the store 's clientele - 1.6 million customers each year . The olive bar alone does $5,000 a week in business . <p> Clearly this involves more than just ethnic customers . And the employees of Jungle Jim 's are thrilled at the mainstreaming of what they do best . It 's internationalism , American-style : good business that helps people , too . <p> " And thank God , " Bonaminio says . " That 's how this country started . " <p> Then he turns his attention to what might happen if the " British Isles " section grows . More music , maybe an interactive game . Maybe even animatronic versions of historical figures to guide customers toward their McVitie 's Jaffa Cakes and Maynard 's Wine Gums . Margaret Thatcher ? Henry VIII ? Gerry and the Pacemakers ? <p> " The changing of the guard would be great , " Bonaminio says , feigning contemplation . " But I DO like Winston Churchill . " <p> Somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're cranking out containers of Ahmed Mango Chutney . At Kioi-chi-Chiyoda-Ku in Tokyo , House Foods Corp . manufactures the unlikely Vermont Curry ( " hot ... with apples and honey " ) . And on 214 Spanish Town Road in Kingston , Jamaica , the refreshing grapefruit beverage known as Ting is born . <p> You 'd have to travel 15,000 miles to collect these products from their birthplaces . But there they are , all within a few feet of each other in Jungle Jim 's : everything Mom used to make - whether she was making it in Iowa or Ireland , Massachusetts or Mauritania or Mongolia . <p> There 's no turning back . In Lancaster , Pa. , where Giant Food Markets is a dominant supermarket chain , people refer to the downtown branch as the " Spanish Giant " because it stocks scads of Hispanic produce and packaged food . Olive Garden restaurants are sending chefs to Italy to learn authentic cooking . On the Food Network , Chefs Ming Tsai and Emeril Lagasse are at the vanguard of cooks turning ethnic dishes into home-cooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in midtown Manhattan advertises " El Nido 's Delicious Pan Pizza and Indian Specialties . " <p> Whatever 's on the horizon , be it lutefisk lo mein or haggis vindaloo , Jim Bonaminio is n't worried . If the world wants it , he 'll find it and sell it . If it comforts customers , all the better . <p> And if a few Joika Fried Venison Meatballs in Creamy Sauce washed down with some sake helps someone realize that Norwegians and Japanese are more like us than we think - well , that 's just fine , too . <p> " Maybe it helps us be just a bit more tolerant , " says Hann , the international foods manager . " I 'd like to think so . " <p> Maybe it 's even transcended tolerance . While much of the world lacks enough to eat , we live in a nation of abundance . The poor in Calcutta and Lagos ca n't get five kinds of fresh papaya , much less pay for it . Yet in an age of consumerism when Americans express themselves by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through it , the stomach - is the true bellwether of cultural acceptance . <p> Because you could argue that all the weird stuff on the shelves of Jungle Jim 's - the boxes of Pocky , the Mauby Drink Concentrate , the ghee and the bok choy and the rambutan and the offal - is slowly , steadily becoming as local as the people who eat it all . <p> It 's no longer foreign . It 's ours . <p> It 's as American as Vermont curry . <p> On the Net : <p> Jungle Jim 's : http : //www.junglejims.com/ <p> End Adv for Release Sunday , July 22 and thereafter <p>
