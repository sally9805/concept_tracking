Oh poor , unsuspecting reader . Here you are , perusing a perfectly respectable magazine , floating down a river of Americana , and you dock at a story on Keenen Ivory Wayans , whom you may remember from the early- ' 90s groundbreaking sketch-comedy series In Living Color , and who has now directed a film called Scary Movie , which opens this week . But before we get to Wayans , we must familiarize you with the film , and there 's the rub . Scary Movie had this writer giggling like Beavis on helium , yet it 's a raunchy piece of work and not easily described in printable detail . <P> It has scenes like this : A guy in a men 's room hears chortling in the next stall , so he puts his ear next to a hole in the wall and gets tickled by an enormous ... <P> Maybe not the best example for print . <P> There 's the , uh , climactic scene in which a sex-starved teenage boy is finally taken to bed and ... <P> To tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say about Scary Movie except that , frankly , Wayans ( a father of three with a fourth on the way , no less ) should be ashamed of himself . <P> " Ashamed and proud at the same time , " he responds . " Ashamed we did it . Proud we got away with it . " What he has got away with is a spoof in the tradition of the Airplane ! and Naked Gun series  --  a send-up of such Hollywood darlings as the teen-horror genre ( Scream ) , the teen-romance genre ( Dawson 's Creek ) and some other nonsacred cows like The Blair Witch Project , The Usual Suspects and The Matrix . Wayans , along with his younger brothers Shawn and Marlon ( who star in the film and share screenplay credit ) , also outgrosses the gross-out genre with two grotesque close-ups of male genitalia and a jaw-dropping ejaculation sight gag . <P> If this appeals to you , do n't be ashamed , for you 're apparently not alone . Thanks in part to a raucous trailer that has been showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been generating rapid-fire word of mouth . The film 's strong " tracking " ( surveys that indicate audiences ' desire to see an upcoming flick ) has inspired the distributor , Miramax 's Dimension division , to step up its marketing blitz and increase its opening-day screens from 1,900 to about 3,000 . <P> Miramax 's co-chairman , Bob Weinstein , should be commended for his sense of humor ; he 's releasing a movie that savages his own Scream franchise . On the other hand , the movie he 's releasing features star Carmen Electra breaking wind . He should be ashamed of himself too . " I appreciate that , " says Weinstein . " I 'd do penance if I was that religion . Since I 'm Jewish , I 'll just feel guilty about it . " <P> As guardians of good taste , we do n't recommend Scary Movie to everyone . For one thing , it 's uneven  --  a flaw even more glaring on second and third viewings . But we happily endorse Wayans ' re-entry into the spotlight . By the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ascended from his humble roots as the second of 10 children in a family in the New York City projects into television history . He had also ascended to the galaxy of stars fated to spend the bulk of their careers overshadowed by their own TV excellence . ( Coincidentally , these stars often have three names : Keenen Ivory Wayans , Mary Tyler Moore and , next up , Sarah Jessica Parker. )
