Donny Carroll , a Republican most of his working life , voted for George W. Bush in 2004 because Bush " was trying to do a good job . " Ask him how he feels now , and you get a different answer . " If he was running again , I would n't vote for him , " says the 61-year-old retired plumber from Eureka , Calif . Why not ? Medicare 's new prescription-drug benefit is too complicated , he says , adding that " the government seems more concerned about drug companies making a profit than the people getting insured . " <P> Carroll is n't the only one feeling disenfranchised . Older folks ' growing disillusionment with Bush bodes ill for Republicans in midterm elections , which are less than a year away . Older Americans are a key G.O.P. constituency . Yet a Wall Street Journal  --  NBC News poll last month found that the G.O.P. 's numbers , which have been sinking , are especially weak among seniors : 58% of respondents 65 and older disapproved of Bush 's handling of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under 65 . Senior support of Republicans in Congress shows signs of eroding too , with more saying they would like Democrats to win control . <P> Difficulty in understanding how to enroll for the new prescription-drug benefit is the biggest issue . Bush claims the new plan offers valuable choices . But seniors find them paralyzing . In most states , they must select from among 40 different insurance plans when what they wanted was " a simple delivery of their prescription drugs , " says Richard Fiesta , director of government and political affairs for the Alliance for Retired Americans . That is aggravated by a looming May 15 enrollment deadline . <P> Dean Cunningham , 72 , a retired railroad-company manager in Albuquerque , N.M. , is further worried that he will lose his more generous employer-provided drug plan . He says he can see the day " when corporations get out of providing prescription-drug coverage for retirees and let the government cover it . " Angry that Congress has n't done more to ensure that he can keep his private plan , Cunningham , a lifelong Republican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next congressional elections . <P> " Over the past year we also had the Social Security debate , in which they did n't support the President 's proposal , " G.O.P. pollster Bill McInturff says of seniors . " We had $3-a-gal. gasoline for this price-sensitive constituency . And they were concerned about the war in Iraq . So there 's been a lot of stuff going on that 's making them pretty riled up . " <P> Surveys have found the elderly to be satisfied with the Social Security system as is  --  and skeptical of Bush 's warnings . " Let 's just tweak it to make sure it works , " says Carroll . <P> Democrats hope to keep the discontent burning . Representative Rahm Emanuel , chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee , sent a memo to the party 's House candidates around the country , urging them to " host town hall meetings with seniors , visit senior centers and build a higher profile explaining that the Republicans ' plan for Medicare is not working .
