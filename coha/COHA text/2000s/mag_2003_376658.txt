Justin Kirk , who plays brokenhearted AIDS sufferer Prior Walter on HBO 's Angels in America , has the kind of impossible good looks that bad-TV actors are made of . And while he has done some bad TV  --  he played Barto Zane for two years on the WB 's forgettable Jack &; Jill  --  in reality , Kirk , 34 , is an accomplished stage actor . He did his first play at 7 ( Brecht , no less ) and has since racked up accolades that include an Obie for playing the blind man in Terrence McNally 's Love ! Valour ! Compassion !  --  " the other gay play of the ' 90s , " says Kirk , who reprised the role in the movie . <P> All the buzz caught the attention of Angels ' director , Mike Nichols , who invited Kirk to audition for the role of Prior . But that could n't stave off his self-doubt when confronted with the enormity of Angels , which Kirk calls " the play for my generation of New York theater guys . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " My first day with Meryl Streep was a pretty horrible day , " says Kirk . " Mike would give me instructions even when I was off-camera because I was so afraid to engage with her . I was like , ' You just do your Meryl Streep thing , and I 'll be over here . ' " <P> The rest of the shoot was n't much better . Though he had prepared technically  --  " I read stuff , watched stuff , lost weight and talked to people  --  most important my hair guy on the movie , who has lived with HIV for many , many , years , went through that time and watched his friends die "  --  Kirk kept doubting that he was ready to play in such a high-stakes arena . " You 're sitting there knowing it 's a dream come true , " he says , " but you ca n't enjoy it because you 're so racked with horror over the idea of playing this classic role and maybe not coming through .

" Like Prior , Kirk may get more than he bargained for .  --  By Desa Philadelphia/Los Angeles
