In the Dark By Richard Laymon Dorchester Publishing Richard Laymon Jane Kerry noticed the envelope when she stepped behind the circulation desk . Her first thought was that it did n't belong on the seat of her chair . She had n't put it there . Had it fallen from the top of the desk ? She wondered if someone might 've lost it , and whether it contained anything of importance . She ignored the envelope as she checked out half a dozen mysteries to old Agnes Dixon . Agnes was one of her regulars , a retired school teacher , and the first person to make Jane feel really welcome in her new job as head of the Donnerville Public Library . While they chatted in quiet voices , a few more people drifted over to the circulation desk . Others wandered out the door . As usual , the library was beginning to empty with the approach of its nine o'clock closing time . The envelope . Jane slipped a dated card into the pocket of Agnes 's last book-a Dick Francis-flipped the cover shut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even as she said , " That 's one of his best , " she took a small step backward . Feeling the push of the seat 's edge against her right buttock , she reached down without looking . She fingered the envelope and picked it up . " Hi , " said a teenaged boy who looked vaguely familiar . " I 'd like to get this , please . " " Sure thing . " He pushed a book toward Jane , cover open , and held out his library card for her . She took it with her left hand . She brought her right hand up and glanced at the envelope . Handwritten in the center , in black , ink was one word : JANE What ? Me ? She felt mildly surprised and perplexed , and a little bit anxious . What could it be ? At least the envelope apparently had n't been lost by anyone , so she would n't need to worry about trying to catch its owner . She tossed it back onto the seat , and returned to business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting to know them better , hoping to show them that she was friendly and always ready to help in any way possible . The mysterious envelope did n't preoccupy her thoughts . Instead , it lingered just off to the side where her mind seemed to glance at it from time to time , and wonder . An invitation ? A greeting card of some kind ? A love letter or poem from a secret admirer ? A complaint ? Maybe a bit of hate mail from someone I shushed . Could be anything , she told herself . Do n't worry about it . You 'll find out as soon as everybody 's cleared out . " If you like that one , " she told a pony-tailed girl , " we 've got a lot more by the same author . " As the girl thanked her and headed for the door , Jane swept her eyes over the remaining people . Quite a bunch . Maybe six still lined up , a few on their way out , a dozen others scattered about the main reading room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stacks . Nobody in sight seemed to be paying any special attention to her . Whoever left it will probably stay behind to see if I open it . Hope he 's cute . Do n't hope for cute , she told herself . Just hope he 's not a weirdo . By the time Jan was done checking out books , only a handful of people still lingered in the reading room . She recognized most of them as regulars . They all seemed busy with their own projects . Don , her assistant , was making his way among the tables , gathering up books and periodicals that needed to be put away . She checked her wristwatch . Ten till nine . She picked up the envelope again . Holding it at waist level so that the desk would hide it from the view of anyone who might be watching , she flipped it over . As she 'd thought , nothing on either side except the handwritten JANE . The envelope looked clean and unrumpled . Its flap was sealed . From the envelope 's thinness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two of folded paper . She picked at a corner of the flap , tore it upward , thrust her forefinger into the small hole , and worked her finger along the seam , ripping upward . As she tore at the flap , she lifted her gaze . Nobody appeared to be watching . Looking down , she removed a folded sheet of paper from the envelope . Lined , three-hole paper of the sort that students use for filling their looseleaf binders . It was folded into thirds . She could see the raised , dark scribbles of the handwriting on the other side . And a darkness within . A darkness caused by an extra layer of paper . Paper the size of a bank check or a dollar bill . Somebody sent me money ? Suddenly , she felt like an idiot . This was not a message from a secret admirer . Nor was it a threat . This was nothing more than payment for a lost book or an overdue fine . Jane felt silly . A little relieved . And a little disappointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bank check , but a stiff , unwrinkled fifty-dollar bill . Must 've been a mighty expensive book , Jane thought . She moved the bill aside and read the handwritten note : Dear Jane , Come and play with me . For further instructions , look homeward , angel . You 'll be glad you did . Warmest Regards , MOG ( Master of Games ) Jane read it again . And again . Then she looked around . The few people who remained in the reading room were paying no attention to her . " We 'll be closing in about five minutes , " she announced . She refolded the note around the fifty-dollar bill and tucked it back inside the envelope . " Don , would you come here for a minute ? " The lanky graduate student hurried toward her . He looked worried . Or guilty ? " Is there a problem , Miss Kerry ? " Jane shook her head . " I do n't think so . " She raised the envelope . " Did you happen to see anyone put this on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if an answer might be written on the ceiling . Then he shook his head . " No . I do n't believe so . " " Anyone hanging around the circulation desk when I was away from it ? " Again , he shook his head . " Not that I noticed . " She shook the envelope . " This is n't from you , is it ? " " Me ? No . What is it ? " Jane hesitated . How much should she tell him ? She 'd known Don for a couple of months , and she did n't really know much about him . Only that he 'd been a part-time helper at the library for a year before her own arrival , he was going for a PhD in English literature at the university across town , that he was single and lived in an apartment a few blocks from the library . She also knew that he was agonizingly shy and apparently had no social life . Maybe he 's trying to start one up with me , she thought , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's an anonymous letter , " she said , and decided not to mention the fifty dollars . His eyes widened . " From a secret admirer ? " " Not exactly . " His jaw dropped . " Not a threat , I hope ! " " No . Just a ... strange sort of message . But you have n't seen anyone wandering around with an envelope like this , or acting in any way furtive near the circulation desk ? " " I certainly have n't . " He eyed the envelope . " May I ? " " Thanks , but ... I do n't think so . " Seeing the dejected look on his face , she added , " It 's rather personal . " " Personal ? " He suddenly blushed . " Oh . Well . Never mind . If I 'd known it was personal ... " He grimaced and shook his head . " I 'm sorry . " " Do n't worry about it , Don . Really . " " I ... may I have your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , yet , but ... I 'm not feeling especially well . My stomach . " He pressed a hand against it . " Sure . Go on ahead . " " Oh , thank you . " He scurried around the end of the circulation desk , entered the office , reappeared moments later with his briefcase , gave Jane a cramped smile and a wave , and hurried for the library doors . " Hope you feel better , " she said . Then he was gone . Jane wondered if she 'd had a hand in causing his sudden illness . Not unlikely . After all , she was his boss and a woman , on top of which she had almost ( but not quite ) accused him of perpetrating the anonymous letter . Plenty to give a person of Don 's temperament a nasty case of upset nerves . Describing the letter as " personal " had apparently been the final straw . Should n't have told him that , she decided . The thing is n't what you 'd normally call personal . Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's not personal , it 's just plain screwy . She glanced at her watch . Five after nine . " We 're closing up now , " she announced . " Time to hit the streets , folks . " When the last was gone , she locked the front doors and returned to the circulation desk . She knew that she ought to go upstairs , make sure nobody was lingering in the stacks , and turn off the lights . She was n't eager to do it , though . Neither she nor Don enjoyed that particular task . Just too creepy up there when you went alone . Too quiet . Too many shadows . Too many hiding places . Just plain spooky . But made a great deal worse because you knew about old Miss Favor , the librarian , Jane 's predecessor . She 'd died up there . Dropped dead from a bad heart . Dropped dead while she was alone , closing for the night . And there she 'd remained until morning when a part-timer had opened the library and discovered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two had " been at her . " He knew the unlucky worker who 'd stumbled onto Miss Favor . " Oh , she was totally freaked out . Totally . She has n't set foot in this library ever since . " The upstairs stacks were n't so bad in the daytime . They were n't so bad at night , either , as long as a few people were up there searching the shelves or working at the study carrels . But they were usually deserted when you went up at closing time . Through some sort of unspoken acknowledgment of their mutual fears , Jane and Don had fallen into the habit of accompanying each other on that special job . It helped . A lot . But tonight , Jane would need to do it alone . Thanks a heap , Don . Well , there was no hurry . Back behind the circulation desk , she picked up the envelope . She removed the note and the fifty-dollar bill , and studied them both . She had rarely seen any denominations higher than twenty dollars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a portrait of President Grant , on the other a rendition of the U.S. Capitol . She supposed it was real . She also supposed that she was meant to keep it . After all , the thing had come in an envelope with her name on it . Why would anyone want to give me fifty bucks ? Was it supposed to be a gift ? she wondered . Or maybe payment for some real or imagined services ? Payment in advance ? Cute , she thought . Maybe now he expects something from me . Figures I 've taken the money , so I owe him . That 's what he thinks . She read the note again : Dear Jane , Come and play with me . For further instructions , look homeward , angel . You 'll be glad you did . Warmest Regards , MOG ( Master of Games ) The " come and play with me " sounded sort of like the eager request a child might make . Will you come out and play ? Of course , " come " was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me " also carried some strong sexual implications . Maybe this was an invitation-payment enclosed-to mess around with its sender . He wants to fuck me . The idea blasted away Jane 's composure . Anger , humiliation , fear , revulsion , and an unexpected surge of desire seemed to hit her all at once , stealing her breath , making her heart race , surging heat through her body . " The bastard , " she muttered . Here 's fifty bucks , now come and play with me . Maybe that is n't what he means , she thought . And maybe it is . She suddenly looked up . She turned her head , scanning the entire room . She saw nobody . What she saw were countless hiding places : in among the rows of bookshelves , down low behind the tables and chairs , behind any of the several shoulder-high card catalogs , behind the photocopy machine . In front of my desk . She pushed her feet against the rung of her chair and raised herself off the cushion . Hands pressed against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edge . Nobody there . She settled down onto her seat again . I ought a get of here , she thought . Then she thought , How dangerous can a guy be if he 's giving me fifty bucks ? Also , he must be familiar with literature . The " look homeward , angel " business was definitely an allusion to the Thomas Wolfe novel-one of Jane 's favorites . She read that part of the note again . " For further instructions , look homeward , angel . " Further ? He sees this note as the initial instruction . He has more for me . Maybe the further instructions will be given face to face . Maybe not . Maybe I 'm supposed to go home and look in my mailbox for the further instructions . Look homeward . Maybe I 'll find an envelope with another note inside-and another fifty dollars . Maybe I 'll find it in the book . Tucked inside a copy of Look Homeward , Angel . The library 's copy , if not checked out or misplaced , should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upstairs stacks . I need to go up there anyway , she reminded herself . I 'll just take a quick look at the book . What if he 's waiting for me there ? ( Continues ... ) by Richard Laymon
