Spent Cartridge Q. Even when I have n't been using the cartridges in my inkjet printer very much , the ink levels still seem to decrease . Is the ink simply evaporating over time ? Is there a way to prevent that ? A .. Ink is designed to evapo-rate quickly  --  the faster it dries , the faster your printed page is safe from smudges . It is possible to lose ink out of the cartridges due to evaporation , especially if you have poked holes in your ink cartridges by using refill kits or unplugged your printer without turning it off first . Refill kits require that you inject ink into the cartridges with a syringe , poking a small hole in the foil seal each time . After a few refills , you can perforate the ink tank so much that the ink will evaporate at a noticeable rate . Since most consumer inkjets use aqueous inks , with a water and glycol base and various chemical pigments , the liquids will evaporate , leaving a higher concentration of pigments and making thicker ink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting gunked up . ( This does n't mean that ink refill kits should be avoided ; just be aware ! ) Photograph : Problems that can affect your inkjet cartridge A are : evaporation from refill punctures B and clogged print heads C. So let your printer " park " its cartridges D at shutdown . &lt;hln&gt;&lt;/hln&gt; Illustration by Headcase design So what 's the problem with cutting power to the printer without turning it off first ? It prevents the printer from " parking " its print heads so they 're not exposed to air . " When users turn off their printers , " explains Cindy Jarom , inkjet writing system and reliability engineer for Hewlett-Packard , the print head " is carefully cleaned before being put to rest in a cap that seals the nozzle . " In fact , losing ink may be the least of your problems if you do n't turn off your printer properly . The print heads can dry up and seal  --  in as little as 30 minutes . In many printers , that means throwing away the ink cartridge entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially frustrating and expensive attempts to unclog and clean them . According to John Stoffel , inkjet ink technology manager for HP , on startup , the company 's printers automatically fire a small amount of ink that has been in the nozzle of the print head to clean out any clogs before they become a problem . So it 's important to let your printer go through its complete startup and shutdown process every time . Those two scenarios aside , it 's possible for the liquids in ink to evaporate out of the cartridge over time , since they are n't sealed to the molecular level from the outside air . But if everything is going by design , the amount of ink lost should be negligible . Upload Your iPod Q. My hard drive recently failed and I lost a lot of data , but my music is backed up on my iPod . If I plug my iPod back into my computer with the new hard drive and blank library , will it erase the music on my iPod , or will it repopulate the music library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to re-import all your music , both MP3s and files purchased from the iTunes Store , but I 'd suggest importing that music back before you install iTunes . Otherwise , there is a chance that iTunes will recognize a setting stored on your iPod to automati-cally keep the iPod and your library synchronized  --  and your new library , being blank , will nuke the one on your iPod . If you had your iPod set to manually resync before , iTunes should prompt you before trying to copy over to the iPod , but if you 're not sure , do n't risk it . Once the iPod is safely connected to your computer , Windows users have two options . If you have properly groomed ID3 tags ( the metadata that describes each song 's information , such as artist , album and track number ) , you can dig into the file structure on the iPod 's " iPodControl " directory and copy all the files out manually , then use iTunes to reimport and rebuild their file names from the ID3 information . ( Be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Explorer settings . ) If that sounds daunting , use one of the third-party tools available to reimport your music from the iPod to your computer , such as Anapod Explorer ( $20 to $30 ; **27;6017;TOOLONG ) . On Macs , iTunes is part of the default install , so quickly kill the iTunes program by hitting Apple+Q as it loads when plugging in your iPod , or move iTunes out of the Applications folder temporarily . To reimport your files , I suggest Senuti ( fadingred.org/senuti/ ) , which is both easy to use and free . Screen Cleaner Q. I have a new LCD television , and I 'm not sure how to clean it . With my old tube set , I just spritzed it with Windex , but the surface of my new TV is n't glass . A. " We recommend using LCD cleanser that can be purchased at any electronics store , " says a customer service tech for Westinghouse , a manufacturer of popular LCD televisions . The cleaner can be found in both spray and wipe form . But what exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chemicals , makers of one of many available LCD cleaners , explains , " The main ingredient in most wipes on the market is water . There needs to be a small percentage of isopropyl alcohol ( IPA ) to help get rid of the grease from busy fingers . " Some LCD cleaning solutions may include up to 50 percent IPA , according to Hui , but any more than that could damage the screens . Since I 'd never suggest you spend more money than you have to , I 'd start with a clean , soft cloth and regular ol ' tap water . You can add just a capful of isopropyl alcohol to a glass of water if you need something to help loosen the greasy gunk on the screen , so it can wipe off more easily . Get the cloth damp and then apply to the screen instead of splashing the screen and trying to wipe up the liquid ; and always  --  always  --  use a clean cloth , as tiny , hard particles trapped in the fibers can scratch the surface of your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power make today 's DVD burners up to 16 times faster than first-gen models ( thus 16x ) . But why are some DVDs rated faster than others ? A disc has no moving parts and no processors , so would a 4x disc really slow down a 16x burner ? Yes , says Bruce Youmans of disc manufacturer TDK . DVDs that record data at up to 16x ( 22Mbps ) use a more reactive dye than their sluggish counterparts . Speedier DVDs mean faster burn times  --  a 16x disc can burn in less than 6 minutes , whereas a 4x disc takes about 15 minutes .  --  Emily Masamitsu <p>
