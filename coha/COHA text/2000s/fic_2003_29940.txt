ELEVENTH HOUR AN FBI THRILLER By Catherine Coulter G. P. Putnam 's Sons SAN FRANCISCO Nick sat quietly in the midnight gloom of the nave , hunched forward , her head in her arms resting on the pew in front of her . She was here because Father Michael Joseph had begged her to come , had begged her to let him help her . The least she could do was talk to him , could n't she ? She 'd wanted to come late , when everyone else was already home asleep , when the streets were empty , and he 'd agreed , even smiled at her . He was a fine man , kind and loving toward his fellow man and toward God . Would she wait ? She sighed at the thought . She 'd given her word , he 'd made her give her word , known somehow that it would keep her here . She watched him walk over to the confessional , watched with surprise as his step suddenly lagged , and he paused a moment , his hand reaching for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to open that door , she thought , staring at him . He did n't want to go in . Then , at last , he seemed to straighten , opened the door and stepped inside . Again , there was utter silence in the big church . The air itself seemed to settle after Father Michael Joseph stepped into that small confined space . The deep black shadows were n't content to fill the corners of the church , they even crept down the center aisle , and soon she was swallowed up in them . There was a patch of moonlight coming throughthe tall stained-glass windows . It should have been peaceful , but it did n't feel that way . There was something else in the church , something that was n't restful , that was n't remotely spiritual . She fidgeted in the silence . She heard one of the outer church doors open . She turned to see the man who was going to make his midnight confession walk briskly into the church . He looked quite ordinary , slender , with a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , look right and left , but he did n't see her , she was in the shadows . She watched him walk to the confessional where Father Michael Joseph waited , watched him open the confessional door and slip inside . Again , silence and shadows hovered around her . She was part of the shadows now , looking out toward the confessional from the dim , vague light . She heard nothing . How long did a confession take ? Being a Protestant , She had no idea . There must be , she thought , some correlation between the number and severity of the sins and the length of the confession . She started to smile at that , but it quickly fell away . She felt a rush of cold air over her , covering her for a long moment before it moved on . How very odd , she thought , and pulled her sweater tighter around her . She looked again at the altar , perhaps seeking inspiration , some sort of sign , and felt ridiculous . After Father Michael Joseph had finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take her hand in his big warm ones , and tell him everything ? Sure , like she 'd ever let that happen . She continued to look up at the altar , its flowing shape blurred in the dim light , the shadows creeping about its edges , soft and otherworldly . Maybe Father Michael Joseph wanted her to sit here quietly with nothing and no one around her . She thought in that moment that even though he wanted her to talk to him , he wanted her to speak to God more . But there were no prayers inside her . Perhaps there were , deep in her heart , but she really did n't want to look there . So much had happened , and yet so little . Women she did n't know were dead . She was n't . At least not yet . He had so many resources , so many eyes and ears , but for now she was safe . She realized sitting there in the quiet church that she was no longer simply terrified as she 'd been two and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was always studying the faces that passed her on the street . Some made her draw back , others just flowed over her , making no impact at all , just as she made no impact on them . She waited . She looked up at the crucified Christ , felt a strange mingling of pain and hope fill her , and waited . The air seemed to shift , to flatten , but the silence remained absolute , without even a whisper coming from the confessional . Inside the confessional , Father Michael Joseph drew a slow , deep breath to steady himself . He did n't want to see this man again , not ever again , for as long as he lived . When the man had called Father Binney and told him he could only come this latehe was terribly sorry , but it was n't safe for him , and he had to confess , he just had toof course Father Binney had said yes . The man told Father Binney he had to see Father Michael Joseph , no one else , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joseph was very afraid he knew why the man had come again . He 'd confessed before , acted contritea man in pain , a man trying to stop killing , a man seeking spiritual help . The second time he 'd come , he 'd confessed yet again to another murder , gone through the ritual as if he 'd rehearsed it , saying all the right words , but Father Michael Joseph knew he was n't contrite , thatthat what ? That for some reason Father Michael Joseph could n't fathom , the man wanted to gloat , because the man believed there was nothing the priest could do to stop him . Of course Father Michael Joseph could n't tell Father Binney why he did n't want to see this evil man . He 'd never really believed in human evil , not until the unimagined horror of September 11th , and now , when this man had come to him for the first time a week and a half ago , then last Thursday , and now again tonight , at nearly midnight . Father Michael Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without remorse , with no ability to feel his own , or another 's , humanity . He wondered if the man had ever felt truly sorry . He doubted it . Father Michael Joseph heard the man breathing in the confessional across from him , and then the man spoke , his voice a soft , low monotone , " Forgive me , Father , for I have sinned . " He 'd recognize that voice anywhere , had heard it in his dreams . He did n't know if he could bear it . He said finally , his voice thin as the thread hanging off his shirt cuff , " What have you done ? " He prayed to God that he would n't hear words that meant another human being was dead . The man actually laughed , and Father Michael Joseph heard madness in that laugh . " Hello to you , too , Father . Yes , I know what you 're thinking . You 're right , I killed the pathetic little prick ; this time I used a garrote . Do you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know . " " He tried to get his hands beneath it , you know , to try to loosen it , to relieve the pressure , but it was nice strong wire . You ca n't do anything against wire . But I eased up just a bit , to give him some hope . " " I hear no contrition in your voice , no remorse , only satisfaction that you committed this evil . You have done this because it pleased you to do it " The man said in a rich , deep , sober voice , " But you have n't heard the rest of my tale , Father . " " I do n't want to hear anything more out of your mouth . " The man laughed , a deep , belly-rolling laugh . Father Michael Joseph did n't say a word . It was cold and stuffy in the confessional , hard to breathe , but his frock stuck to his skin . He smelled himself in that sweat , smelled his dread , his fear , his distaste for this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , leave and never come back . " Just when he thought he had pulled it loose enough so he could breathe , I jerked it tight , really fast , you know , and it sliced right through his fingers all the way to the bone . He died with his damned fingers against his own neck . Grant me absolution , Father . Did you read the papers , Father ? Do you know the man 's name ? " Father Michael Joseph knew , of course he knew . He 'd watched the coverage on television , read it in the Chronicle . " You murdered Thomas Gavin , an AIDS activist who 's done nothing but good in this city . " " Did you ever sleep with him , Father ? " He was n't shocked , had n't been shocked by anything for the past twelve years , but he was surprised . The man had never taken this tack before . He said nothing , just waited . " No denial ? Stay silent , if you wish . I know you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But the fact is , he had to die . It was his time . " " There is no absolution for you , not without true repentance . " " Why am I not surprised you feel that way ? Thomas Gavin was just another pathetic man who needed to leave this world . Do you want to know something , Father ? He was n't really real . " " What do you mean he was n't really real ? " " Just what I said . He did n't really ever exist , you know ? He was n't ever really herehe just existed in his own little world . I helped him out of his lousy world . Do you know he contracted AIDS just last year ? He just found out about it . He was going nuts . But I saved him , I helped him out of everything , that 's all . It was a rather noble thing for me to do . It was a sort of an assisted suicide . " " It was vicious , cold-blooded murder . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead . Because of you . Do n't try to excuse what you did . " " Ah , but I was giving you a metaphor , Father , not an excuse . Your tone is harsh . Are n't you going to give me my penance ? Maybe have me say a million Hail Marys ? Perhaps have me score my own back with a whip ? Do n't you want me to plead with you to intercede with God on my behalf , beg for my forgiveness ? " " A million Hail Marys would n't get you anywhere . " Father Michael leaned closer , nearly touched that evil , smelled the hot breath of that man . " Listen to me now . This is not a sacramental confession . You believe that I am bound by silence , that anything anyone tells me can go no farther than the confessional . That is not true . You have not made a sacramental confession ; you are not contrite , you seek no spiritual absolution , and I am not bound to silence . I will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he disagrees with me , I am prepared to leave the priesthood if I have to . Then I will tell the world what you have done . I wo n't allow this to continue . " " You would really turn me over to the cops ? That is very impassioned of you , Father . I see that you are seriously pissed . I did n't know there was a loophole in your vow of silence . I had wanted you to be forced to beg and plead and threaten , but realize you 're helpless and let it eat you alive . But how can anyone predict someone 's behavior , after all ? " " They 'll throw you in an institution for the rest of your miserable life . " The man smothered a laugh , managed a credible sigh , and said , laughing , " You mean to imply that I 'm insane , Father ? " " No , not just insane . I think you 're a psychopathah , I believe the politically correct word is sociopath , is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conscience . It does n't matter , whatever you are , it 's worse than anything doctors could put a tag to . You do n't give a damn about anybody . You need help , although I doubt anyone could help the sickness in you . Will you stop this insanity ? " " Would you like to shoot me , Father ? " " I am not like you . But I will see that you are stopped . There will be an end to this . " " I fear I ca n't let you go to the cops , Father . I 'm trying not to be angry with you for not behaving as you should . All right . Now I 'm just mildly upset that you are n't behaving as you 're supposed to . " " What are you talking aboutI 'm not acting like I 'm supposed to ? " " It 's not important , at least it is n't for you . Do you know you 've given me something I 've never had before in my life ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never had so much fun in my life . Except , maybe , for this . " He waited until Father Michael Joseph looked toward him through the wire mesh . He fired point-blank , right through the priest 's forehead . There was a loud popping sound , nothing more because he 'd screwed on a silencer . He lowered the gun , thoughtful now because Father Michael Joseph had slumped back against the wooden confessional wall , his head up , and he could see his face clearly . There was not even a look of surprise on the priest 's face , just a flash of something he could n't really understand . Was it compassion ? No , certainly not that . The priest despised him , but now he was shackled for all eternity , without a chance for him to go to the police , no opportunity for him even to take the drastic step of leaving the priesthood . He was silent forever . No loophole now . Now Father Michael Joseph did n't have to worry about a thing . His tender conscience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If so , maybe Father Michael Joseph was looking down on him , knowing there was still nothing he could do . Or maybe the priest was hovering just overhead , over his own body , watching , wondering . " Good-bye , Father , wherever you are , " he said , and rose . He realized , as he eased out of the confessional and carefully closed the narrow wooden door , that the look on the Father 's facehe 'd looked like he 'd won . But that made no sense . Won what ? The good Father had just bought the big one . He had n't won a damned thing . There was no one in the church , not that he expected there to be . It was dead silent . He would have liked it if there had been a Gregorian chant playing softly . But no , there was nothing , just the echo of his own footsteps on the cold stones . What did that damned priest have to look happy about ? He was dead , for God 's sake . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused a moment to breathe in the clean midnight air , and craned his neck to look up at the brilliant star-studded sky . A very nice night , just like it was supposed to be . Not much of a moon , but that was all right . He would sleep very well tonight . He saw a drunk leaning against a skinny oak tree set in a small dirt plot in the middle of the sidewalk , just across the street , his chin resting on his chestnot the way it was supposed to be , but who cared ? The guy had n't heard a thing . There would be nothing but questions with no answers for now , since the cops would n't have a due . The priest had made him do things differently , and that was too bad . But it was all close enough . But the look on the priest 's face , he did n't like to think about that , at least not now . He whistled as he walked beneath the streetlight on Filmore , then another block to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two small spaces , really . This was a residential area and there was little parking space . But that , too , was just the way it was supposed to be . It was San Francisco , after all . One more stop to make . He hoped she 'd be home , and not working .
