<p> In a sometimes tartly worded opinion , a federal judge in Pennsylvania ruled Tuesday that intelligent design is religion , not science , and that teaching it in Dover 's public schools violates the First Amendment 's insistence on the separation of church and state . <p> " In making this determination , " wrote Judge John E. Jones III , " we have addressed the seminal question of whether ID is science . We have concluded that it is not , and moreover that ID can not uncouple itself from its creationist , and thus religious , antecedents . ... We hold that the ID policy is unconstitutional . " <p> The ruling in Katzmiller vs . Dover Area School District concluded a widely watched six-week trial , the first court test of intelligent design . Although it is binding only for the district of Dover , the ruling may well prove influential if other such cases make their way into court , especially given the scholarly and substantive nature of Jones ' 139-page opinion . <p> Last October , the Dover Area School Board voted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biology curriculum that questioned the Darwinian theory of evolution , and referred students instead to a Christian textbook titled " Of Pandas and People . " Eleven parents of children in the Dover district , represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and other lawyers , sued the board . <p> In his opinion , Jones found that the religious nature of intelligent design " is evident because it involves a supernatural designer . " Intelligent design holds that some parts of nature are too complex to be accounted for by evolution and therefore are the handiwork of an unspecified intelligent designer . <p> The judge wrote that evidence at the trial  --  in which scientific witnesses were called by both sides and which often resembled a classroom more than a courtroom  --  " demonstrates that ID is nothing less than the progeny of creationism . " The U.S. Supreme Court , in a 1987 decision , Edwards vs . Aguillard , ruled that creationism was also religiously based and , as such , could not be taught in public schools . <p> Because copious evidence was presented during the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote , " no other tribunal in the United States is in a better position than we are to traipse into this controversial area . " He concluded that the goal of intelligent design proponents " is not to encourage critical thought , " as they asserted in testimony , " but to foment a revolution which would supplant evolutionary theory , " the bedrock of biology , " with ID . " <p> At a press conference Tuesday , the plaintiffs and their lawyers were jubilant . Tammy Katzmiller , who has two children in Dover High School , said it was a great feeling . <p> Witold Walzcak , one of the plaintiffs ' attorneys , said he was thrilled and castigated the proponents of intelligent design for trying to " shackle our children 's minds with 15th century pseudoscience . " <p> But some proponents of intelligent design indicated they would continue to pursue their goals . <p> The Discovery Institute of Seattle , which supports the teaching of intelligent design , issued a statement accusing Jones of trying " to stop the spread of a scientific idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ censorship rather than open debate , and it wo n't work . " <p> The statement described Jones as an activist judge , a criticism that Jones , a Republican appointed by President Bush , anticipated in his opinion . <p> " Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge ... this is manifestly not an activist Court , " he wrote . " Rather this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board , aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ID . " <p> Jones was referring to the Thomas More Law Center , of Ann Arbor , Mich . Its president , Richard Thompson , who litigated the case without a fee , told the New York Times Tuesday : " A thousand opinions by a court that a particular scientific theory is invalid will not make that scientific theory invalid . It is going to be up to the scientists who are going to continue to do research in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An appeal of Jones ' decision may be complicated . Eight of the nine members of the Dover school board who had approved the introduction of intelligent design in the classroom were defeated in an election last month . In interviews , the newly elected members indicated they were not inclined to pursue the matter . <p> At the plaintiffs teleconference , attorney Eric Rothschild said , " the only party that has standing to appeal is the Dover Area School Board , and they indicated they wo n't do that . " <p> But Eugenie Scott , executive director of the National Center for Science Education in Oakland , who was an adviser to the plaintiffs , said that just as creationism morphed into intelligent design after it was ruled unconstitutional , proponents of intelligent design " are going to continue working on ways of getting evolution out of science curricula . " <p> Dr. John West , an associate director of the Discovery Institute , said in a statement : " Anyone who thinks a court ruling is going to kill off interest in intelligent design is living in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fundamentalist Christian former members of the school board , Alan Bonsell and William Buckingham , who , Jones argued , drove the decision to teach intelligent design . " The inescapable truth is that Bonsell and Buckingham lied " under oath , the judge wrote . <p> Though the decision is not binding on other courts , Rothschild , the plaintiffs ' attorney , said he believed the " carefully reasoned , highly researched opinion ... will exert tremendous persuasive " pressure on other courts , and in other school districts where intelligent design might be under consideration . <p> In a statement , Lawrence Krauss , a physics professor at Case Western Reserve University and a board member of the Campaign to Defend the Constitution , called the decision " profoundly sensible . U.S. children are consistently scoring behind those of other nations in ... science . ( This decision ) should send a message to school boards across America and to those who attempt to use them as pawns in an ideological public relations initiative that we can not expect to close this gap if we substitute ideology for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ judge 's decision <p> Excerpts from U.S. District Judge John E. Jones III 's ruling : <p> " We find that the secular purposes claimed by the Board amount to a pretext for the Board 's real purpose , which was to promote religion in the public school classroom , in violation of the Establishment Clause . " <p> " Repeatedly in this trial , Plaintiffs ' scientific experts testified that the theory of evolution represents good science , is overwhelmingly accepted by the scientific community , and that it in no way conflicts with , nor does it deny , the existence of a divine creator . " <p> " Those who disagree with our holding will likely mark it as the product of an activist judge . If so , they will have erred as this is manifestly not an activist Court . Rather , this case came to us as the result of the activism of an ill-informed faction on a school board , aided by a national public interest law firm eager to find a constitutional test case on ( intelligent design ) , who in combination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ policy . " <p> " The overwhelming evidence at trial established that ( intelligent design ) is a religious view , a mere re-labeling of creationism , and not a scientific theory . " <p> " The evidence presented in this case demonstrates that ( intelligent design ) is not supported by any peer-reviewed research , data or publications . " <p> Associated Press
