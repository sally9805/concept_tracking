<p> Maybe the blast of a horn came in time to turn tragedy into a near-miss . Maybe there was no sound , just the shudder at the realization you did n't see the red light or did n't notice the car in the next lane until the last second . <p> The crime of vehicular homicide is not reserved for drunks and daredevils . Unless you never lose concentration , never cheat just a little in a hurry , it could have been you . <p> As it happened , it was Diana Devereux , a 44-year-old mother of two with no criminal record . She had no weapon and no malice , just a car and not enough patience . <p> At 2:30 p.m. on Oct. 4 , 2005 , Devereux did n't look carefully enough around two school buses before she tried to turn left into the Kensington MARTA station . Her Honda Accord crossed into the path of a motorcycle . The driver , an off-duty DeKalb County police officer , tried to stop but could n't avoid the crash . <p> He died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court and told the judge she was guilty . <p> DeKalb Solicitor General Shawn LaGrua recommended Devereux be sentenced to three to four months in jail . <p> Devereux 's attorney , Henry Hibbert , asked State Court Judge Alvin Wong for another punishment  --  such as probation or house arrest  --  that would allow Devereux to keep her $11.39-an-hour job as a cashier in a cafeteria . <p> That 's how Devereux supports herself and a disabled adult son who lives with her . <p> " Diana 's remorse is very deep , " Hibbert said . <p> But would remorse be punishment enough ? <p> Would it be unfair to punish Diana Devereux for a mistake ? Or would it send a message that there are no excuses for disregarding the safety of others on the road ? <p> ' Were they sure it was him ? ' <p> A widow named Onika St. James sat in the courtroom . <p> That could have been you , too . <p> Perhaps you take comfort in the safe driving habits of your loved ones in the crowded and fast-paced traffic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> She met the love of her life at Alabama State University in Montgomery , her hometown . Renaldo St. James was a Chicagoan . They married in 1997 and moved to metro Atlanta when St. James landed a job with the DeKalb police force . <p> St. James assured his wife he was careful on his dangerous job , and the same applied for driving . He was a stickler behind the wheel . Everyone in the family knew they would get a reminder from him if they forgot to use a turn signal . <p> Yet , Onika St. James found officers at her door last Oct. 4 . They said there had been an accident , that it was n't his fault  --  that he was gone . <p> " Gone where ? " she asked . <p> St. James was so careful , his wife told the officers . <p> As she recalled the terrible day months later , she remembered asking the officers , " Were they sure it was him ? ... Everyone who came in that day , I asked them , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face reality and answer questions from the couple 's 5-year-old son , Renaldo Curtis St. James II , who wanted to know why there were so many police cars at the house . He seemed to accept the news at first , but later that night he saw his father 's picture on television and heard something about " survivors . " <p> " Mommy , " he said , " Daddy survived . " <p> No , she said , you and I are the survivors . " We 're left behind . " <p> He fell in her lap kicking and screaming . <p> ' What degree of carelessness ' <p> Police reports on open vehicular homicide cases in DeKalb remind drivers of the physics of mass and velocity that surround us every day on the road : A woman in an SUV tries to turn left into an apartment complex striking a car that hits a pedestrian at a bus stop . The small car 's driver and the pedestrian die . <p> A tractor-trailer driver rear-ends an SUV on rain-slicked I-285 , killing a passenger in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red light , say police . His passenger , his 74-year-old wife , dies in the ensuing crash . So , too , does a passenger in the sports car struck by the SUV . <p> In such cases , in which the driver is not drunk or clearly reckless , the vehicular homicide charge usually is a misdemeanor , punishable by up to a year in jail . Many defendants , such as Devereux , plead guilty . <p> That leaves prosecutors wondering what punishment to recommend . <p> " The hard thing about vehicular homicide is assessing what degree of carelessness is involved in causing someone 's death , " LaGrua said . <p> An important factor is whether the driver had a history of bad driving that should have made him or her more careful . <p> In Devereux 's case , she had been cited for " failure to yield " after causing an accident in December 2002 . There were no injuries and only minor damage , but the circumstances foreshadowed the tragedy less than three years later : She turned left across a four-lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kensington MARTA station last Oct. 4 , Devereux tried to be careful , she said in a written statement to police . <p> " I stop to see what the school buses were going to do ... I did n't see any kids getting off so I turn , " she wrote in a shaky hand . <p> She did not see St. James ' motorcycle in the oncoming right lane , beside two school buses that were stopped as their drivers waited to turn into an apartment complex . St. James was thrown 29 feet . The police told Onika St. James her husband was dead by the time his body came to rest on the pavement . <p> He was 37 . <p> " I thank God my husband did not suffer , ... but I wonder , what did my husband think ? " she said . <p> Even though she agreed to talk about the accident , Onika St. James did not want to be photographed to respect her husband 's private nature . She looks the part of the young professional she is , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no tears in a long conversation , but she talked about her struggle to understand how she could be a widow at 31 . <p> She turned to grief counseling , and she draws strength from religious faith . <p> " Day by day , it sinks in , " she said . Her son , now 6 , has gone on to new sports teams  --  he 's played basketball , T-Ball and soccer . But now he is without the father who tried to attend every game . <p> She hopes her husband 's spirit will help her when her son matures into more grown-up challenges . <p> But if she sees a DeKalb police car or a motorcycle , the painful memories return . <p> " It 's a hard ache , like a physical ache . " <p> Words from a widow <p> For months , Onika St. James considered what she might say to the judge who would ultimately decide Devereux 's punishment . <p> Her feelings , she said , changed every day until " it 's just like you 're drained . " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ podium July 13 , she could not hold back her tears . She struggled for composure throughout her brief comments . <p> She referred to her son , seated in a courtroom pew . <p> " It 's rough to take him to his father 's grave , " she said . <p> The defense lawyer had talked about Devereux 's job , so she wanted to remind the judge her husband was " gainfully employed , " too . <p> " Please help us to feel , help my son to feel , that the justice system works , " she said . She did not ask for a specific sentence before returning to her seat and putting her arm around her son . <p> Devereux did not want to be interviewed , but she also spoke in court that day . She turned to face Onika St. James . <p> " Mrs. St. James and to the family , I am deeply saddened that you have to go through this . I pray day in and day out that you find peace in our Savior Christ the Lord . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had to go through this . " <p> Devereux turned back to the judge and added , " I am willing to take some responsibility for what has happened , and I leave it in your hands . " <p> A judge makes his decision <p> During that July 13 hearing , Judge Wong had something to say . <p> " Everybody takes driving a car so lightly . Flying in and out . I do it . You do it . Everybody does it , " Wong said . <p> " I got a woman going to jail . I got a family without a father . Why ? Because we 're all in such a hurry every day . And I 'm supposed to find an answer . " <p> Initially , Wong sentenced Devereux to six months in jail but allowed her to remain free while he considered reducing the jail time . <p> On Wednesday , Devereux and the lawyers were back in court . Both sides said they had agreed to 60 days of jail time , to be served on weekends . <p> In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Hibbert filed a letter from Devereux 's employer of 11 years . She might lose her job if absent for more than two consecutive weeks . <p> The hearing was scheduled with one day 's notice , and Onika St. James could not arrange to leave work . Reached by telephone Thursday , she declined to comment on the judge 's final sentence : <p> Forty hours of community service . <p> Restitution of $578 . <p> No driver 's license for two years . <p> And 48 days in jail  --  two consecutive weeks followed by 17 weekends .
