In River Bend 's big pasture , the horses waited for rain . Cottonwood branches danced overhead , but instead of rustling , the dry leaves clacked . The horses stood with heads up and nostrils wide , searching for a trace of moisture on the breeze . Across the dirt driveway , near the house , Sam did the same . She stood in the vegetable garden , where she was supposed to be turning over dirt to mix parched cornstalks and empty vines with the earth . Instead , she leaned on her shovel and wished she 'd brought a water bottle outside with her . Two sparrows dove for a worm her digging had uncovered . The birds cheeped and quarreled , then flew off , in a flurry of feathers , leaving the lucky worm untouched . Sam looked skyward . The noon sun was sealed down by a lid of gray clouds . Irritated whinnies and the thud of hooves came from the big pasture . Banjo , Dad 's roping horse , bolted across the sparse grass . Teeth bared , Strawberry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that ran off the drought-hardened land , it had n't rained since spring . Now it was October . Every creature was edgy with waiting . More hooves thudded inside the round pen , but these made a soothing sound , just like the voice that directed them . " Other way , " Jake said . " Good horse . " Friday after school , Jake had mounted Teddy Bear for the first time . Now it was Saturday morning , and the colt was already responding to the bit and reins . The morning quiet did n't last for long . Blaze burst barking from the barn , and Sam noticed a plume of dust approaching the ranch . The roar of an overtaxed engine told her who was driving even beforethe beige Cadillac crossed the bridge too fast and skidded into the ranch yard . Sam dropped the shovel . For their neighbor Linc Slocum , everything was a crisis . Still , it was always possible it was a real emergency . The Cadillac 's horn blared , even though Gram had already appeared , wiping her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had emerged from the shady barn , blinking against the sunlight . Jake slipped out of the round corral and beat everyone to Slocum 's side . " Rachel 's missing , " Linc said as Sam got close enough to hear . Gram patted Linc 's arm as the man removed his oversized cowboy hat and sighed . " I do n't know what to think , " he explained . " I 'd just got back from riding with Jed . " Linc scanned faces , making sure they recognized the name of Jed Kenworthy , his foreman . " But he stayed out with the other hands and I came back . Otherwise I sure would 've got him helping me . " " How long has she been gone ? " Gram asked . " Hard to say . Let 's see . " Linc squinted as he tried to recall . " When I got back home , Rachel was lazing around her suite and then I had a snack and after that I sorta dozed off . " He shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam 's eyes slid toward Jake . Jake was only sixteen , but he spotted trouble better than anyone Sam knew . And he did n't look worried . In fact , when he crossed his arms over his belt buckle , he seemed to be telling Linc to get to the point . " Thing is , " Slocum said , sounding as if he were about to make a confession , she was perturbed about something . In fact , she 's been sort of put out  --  say , how long has it been since I had the rodeo stock contractor over to the house ? " Slocum mused a minute . " All week . Yessir . " Linc sounded amazed . " She 's been perturbed all week long . " For an instant , Sam wondered how he could tell perturbation from Rachel 's usual attitude , but then she understood his amazement . How could Rachel be dissatisfied for a full week ? She wore the finest clothes and makeup . A driver took her to school in a baby blue Mercedes Benz , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertainment systems . Rachel was her father 's princess , and she pretty much ruled Darton High School , as well . Her face , hair , and figure might have been composed by a computer designing the perfect girl . Too bad no one had pushed the button marked " personality , " Sam thought . " Could the stock contractor have said something to upset her ? " Gram asked . " No , no way . " Linc actually blushed . " We were cutting a deal for my Brahmas , that 's all . " Did Linc redden because the stock contractor had rejected his bulls ? City-bred Slocum really did n't know what he was doing when it came to animals , Sam thought . He just liked playing cowboy . " Where do you think she 's got off to ? " Dallas asked . He sounded more sympathetic than Sam felt . " Did she take a car ? " Jake added . Though Rachel did n't have a driver 's license , she would n't let such a formality stop her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick her up or I would 've heard tires . " Linc wedged a thumb into the tooled leather belt that strained around his middle . " But my horse is missing , too . " " Why would she take Champ ? Rachel hates horses , " Sam blurted . " Well now  --  " Slocum frowned . " She does , " Sam insisted . " She says they 're dumb and dirty , and she ca n't understand why anyone likes them . " Gram made a cautioning sound , but Sam knew she was right . " I do n't mean to be rude , Mr. Slocum , but she told me all that herself . " " My ex-wife made the twins ride for three hours every day when they were little , " Slocum said . " Ryan took to it and Rachel did n't . Maybe that 's why he 's in England . Now that his mom 's married that baron , or whatever he is , they have stables packed with horses . " Slocum sounded wistful . For about two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered the spade bit he used on Champ ...
