Chapter One " Conrad . Conrad ... " The first light of dawn was creeping over the horizon when Conrad was roused from his slumber by Rollo 's hollering . Conrad only ever slumbered , he never slept , not the sleep of a child , dead to the world , its oversized surroundings . One small part of his brain kept constant vigil , snatching at the slightest noise or shift in smell . It no longer bothered him . He accepted it for what it was : a part of him now , like the scar in his side and the remorseless throb of his damaged knee . The boards groaned under his feet as he shuffled from his shack onto the narrow deck that ringed it . The sharp salt air stabbed his lungs , raw from too many cigarettes the previous evening . As if in reprimand , an overflowing ashtray still sat on the arm of the slatted wooden chair out front . A book lay facedown on an upturned fish crate beside the molten remains of a candle and an all-but-empty bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night , the bugs dancing dangerously close to the candle flame until it had finally sputtered and died . The waxing moon , so high and prominent at dusk , had long departed , having run her early course ; and for a further hour he had sat in the deep darkness , breathing in time to the beat of the waves beyond the high beach-bank , sleep rising up around him like the unseen tide , his mind numbed by the liquor , his body by the blanket of night dew settling over him . Conrad stared at the chair , unable to recall the short stroll he must surely have made from the abandoned perch to his bed . " Conrad . Conrad ... " The cries were closer now , carried on the breeze , but Rollo was nowhere to be seen among the tumbling dunes . Conrad guessed that when he finally appeared he 'd be flailing his arms like a windmill . He always did , when he was excited or running . Right now , it sounded like he was doing both . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his arms were slicing the air . He bounded down the face of the dune , hurdling a large clump of beach grass , stumbling momentarily but recovering his footing . He was panting , sucking in air , when he finally drew to a halt by the shack . Conrad waited for him to catch his breath . Rollo 's lank dark hair was streaked by the sun and the salt air as it always was at this time of year . When he finally looked up and smiled , his teeth stood out like bleached bone against the deep amber of his skin . " You 're not wearin ' no clothes . " " Well , what do you know ? " Conrad allowed a note of mild irritation to creep into his voice . " Go get togged up . " " This better be good . " " Oh , it 's good , it 's good . " They paused as they reached the top of the high dune that separated Conrad 's isolated home from the ocean . Overhead , a handful of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beneath them , the broad beach stretched off to the western horizon , one hundred miles of almost unbroken sand , straight as a yardarm , reaching into the heart of New York City . A few miles to the east , beyond the sandy lowlands of Napeague where they now stood , rose the high ground of Montauk , a noble up-thrust of ridged and pitted glacial moraine at the very tip of the South Fork-Long Island 's last defiant cry before it tumbled into the oblivion of the Atlantic . Beyond lay nothing but water ... and the lost dreams of the Old World . The ocean was suspiciously calm and limpid , the towering breakers the only indication of the powerful forces that lurked beneath its pewter skin . Even from here , Conrad could see that the longshore set was still running west to east-a sporadic event that occurred when a tendril of warm water broke free of the Gulf Stream , snaking northwards , assisted on its lazy passage by a sustained southwesterly blow . The marked rise in sea temperature was welcomed by the ever-increasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beach from Memorial Day to Labor Day . It lured them beyond the relative safety of the crashing surf into the deeper water with its counterintuitive jostle of currents . Fortunately , the warmer waters were awash with bait , and with the bait came the predators , bluefish and striped bass , which in turn attracted an even larger predator-man . Many owed their lives to the happy conjunction of treacherous swimming conditions and increased fishing activity off the ocean beach . Many were those who 'd been plucked limp and spluttering from the water into one of the cumbersome little dories used by the local surfmen . Once deposited safely on the beach , embarrassment-more often than not-would get the better of gratitude , and they 'd hurry off , eager to banish the memory , casting a few mumbled words of thanks over their shoulders as they went . This was n't always the case . Everyone knew the story of Gus Bowyer , how he had returned to his shingled home on Atlantic Avenue one afternoon to find a gleaming new motorcar standing beside the old barn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant little to Gus , who was unable to read or write , and he 'd been obliged to wait two puzzling hours for his wife 's return from Montauk , where she worked as a dispatch clerk for the Long Island Rail Road . Within a few minutes of crossing the threshold , Edna Bowyer informed her husband that they were now the proud owners of a Dodge Special Type-B Sedan-a gift from a gangling New York architect whom Gus had saved from near-certain drowning off the ocean beach the previous month . News of the couple 's windfall soon spread , and for the remainder of the summer , bathers who were even so much as tumbled by a wave would find themselves descended upon by a pack of alert and overly obliging local fishermen . Edna , a pillar of Puritan common sense , had urged Gus to return the overstated vehicle to the Halsey Auto Company in East Hampton and recoup the purchase price in cash . God knows , they needed the money . Twenty-two years on , they still needed the money , and Gus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Amagansett . " She 's on the turn , " said Rollo , meaning the set , not the tide . The wind had come around overnight . By noon the vast body of water in motion would grind to a halt , then slowly turn back on itself . The natural order would prevail once more with the current scouring the coast from east to west . Interesting , but hardly worthy of a predawn rousing . " Remind me to be angry with you when I wake , " muttered Conrad , turning to leave . " Whale off ! " Everyone knew the call to arms , though it was no longer heard on the South Fork of Long Island , the days of shore whaling some forty years past . Conrad turned back slowly . " Bound east'rd inside the bar . " " You sure ? " " ' Less you saw a fifty-foot bass before , " grinned Rollo , pleased with his riposte . They scanned the ocean in silence , with just the hoarse cries of a few black-backed gulls wheeling overhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . A patch of whorls and eddies ruffled the still surface of the ocean a hundred yards directly offshore . A few moments later , the whale broke water and blew-two distinct jets , fanned by the wind , caught in the sun 's earliest rays . " Right whale , " observed Rollo , identifying the species from its forked spout . But Conrad was already gone , padding down the side of the dune onto the beach . The whale blew four more times before sounding . For over an hour they tracked the leviathan on its journey eastwards , their faces warmed by the rising sun . They walked in silence , not needing to share their thoughts . Right whales had n't been sighted off Amagansett for decades . Hunted to near extinction , they had once been a cornerstone of life on the South Fork . Three hundred years previously when a straggle of English families first appeared in the woods a few miles to the west , they found the local Montaukett Indians already preying on the migrating schools that roamed the ocean beach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dugout canoes . With the crude geometry of a child , those first white settlers pegged out a community around a slender marsh , fashioning cellar-shelters from the trees they had felled , naming their new home Maidstone , after the English town in the county of Kent where most had sprung from . Fourteen years later , when the hamlet rechristened itself East Hampton , the dwellings had crept above ground , the early " soddies " replaced by New England saltbox houses clad in cypress shingles and insulated against the sharp winters with seaweed and corncobs ; the marsh had been excavated to create the town pond ; and the townsmen were in effective control of a small , burgeoning , and highly profitable shore-whaling industry . " Away with you . Hoooo . Woooo . " Conrad was dimly aware that they 'd passed the Napeague Coast Guard station . Now Rollo was striding towards the water 's edge , waving his arms in front of him . The whale had altered its course and was heading inshore at an angle to the beach . With a lazy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 's goin ' to beach , " cried Rollo . He started running , set on heading the whale off . When Conrad caught up with him , he was standing in the wash , oblivious to the waves breaking around him , scouring the ocean . Without warning , the whale surfaced beyond the white water to their left . At this short distance , the sheer bulk of the creature was overwhelming . It filled their field of vision , deadening all other senses . " Hooo . Woooo . Yaaaaa . YAAAA- " A rogue wave caught Rollo broadside , slapping the wind from his lungs , sending him sprawling . Conrad hauled him to his feet , dragging him up the beach , but Rollo pulled free , Stumbling back into the wash . The waves became clouded with rile , churned sand where the whale had grounded . Conrad was struck by the bitter irony of the sight-Rollo Kemp , grandson of the legendary whaleman Cap'n Josh Kemp , the last man to take a whale off the ocean beach ; Rollo Kemp pathetically hurling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a creature his grandfather had devoted a lifetime to slaughtering . Laughter filled his head . It was a few moments before he realized the sound was coming from behind him . Gabe Cowan , chief boatswain 's mate of the Napeague Coast Guard station , stood chortling uncontrollably , his creased face like weathered oilskin . A good-natured man , and a first-rate fiddler till arthritis turned his hands to gnarled claws , Conrad 's reproachful look seemed only to amuse him further . " It 's them krill , " said Gabe . " What ? " " Come up on the Gulf Stream then pushed inshore . She 's feedin ' , off of the krill . " He laughed some more . Beyond the prancing figure of Rollo , the whale had turned parallel to the beach , sieving its breakfast from the ocean . Conrad hurried over to Rollo . " Rollo , she 's feeding ... " Deaf to his words , Rollo 's face was wet with spray and tears . Conrad seized him , binding his arms to his sides , holding him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeding on krill , " he said gently . Rollo 's struggles subsided , his eyes searching Conrad 's face . " Never seen it before , " muttered Gabe , appearing beside them . " Sight to behold , boys , sight to behold . " Conrad only released Rollo when he started to laugh . " Go get ' em , " he yelled . " Go get ' em krill ! " Maybe his cries startled the whale ; more than likely she had had her fill ; but with some difficulty she swung herself around and headed offshore , presenting first her small end and then the giant fan of her tail as she kicked below the surface . They waited , watching . She showed briefly just beyond the outer bar , blowing only once before disappearing for good . A summer flounder flapped weakly at the edge of the wash , stunned by its encounter with the whale . " Well , what do you know ... " said Gabe , taking two nimble strides and stamping down with the heel of his boot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Coast Guard station , reflecting on what they had just witnessed . As far as any of them knew , the coastal wanderings of right whales had always been confined to the colder months , June at the very latest . What was it doing here at this time of year ? Had it been alone ? Where was it headed ? Conrad contributed his share of idle banter , but his thoughts were elsewhere . The episode was somehow emblematic of the times . It was as though the turbulence of the past years had infected the ocean as well , disturbing the natural rhythms , disorienting its occupants . " You boys figure on haulin ' down ? " asked Gabe . Rollo looked to Conrad to reply . They had planned to take the morning off , treat themselves to a well-earned rest , maybe set a gill net off Shagwong later in the day . " Seeing as we 're up , " said Conrad , and Rollo beamed . " Set 's on the turn . Be one hell of a chop out there come noon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earn that wage ? " " That ai n't no wage , it 's a goddamn insult . " " Man your age , scavenging for his lunch ? " said Conrad . " The shame of it . " Gabe glanced at the dead flounder and laughed . " That 's the truth . " Everyone knew that Gabe had squirreled away a small fortune over the years , largely thanks to a case of temporary blindness contracted during Prohibition . " Would n't bank on much of a haul , " said Gabe . " When the wind 's from the east , the fish is least . " He wandered up the beach to the Coast Guard station , a grandiose weatherboard affair perched high on the frontal dune . Conrad turned to Rollo . " Thanks " he said . " Huh ? " " For waking me . " Rollo smiled . " Told you it was good . " They ate a full breakfast on the front deck of Conrad 's house as they did every morning , weather permitting . The menu never changed-pork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sourdough bread smeared with butter , and strong coffee , black as caulking tar , thick enough to float a nail . Afterwards , over a smoke , they would discuss the fishing prospects for the day ahead , trading the little hearsays that were the lifeblood of the fishing community . " Old Emmett took a full charge of cow bass on the Two Mile Hollow set , none of them under thirty pound , " Rollo would say , or " Lindy says the bluefish is running off of Cedar Point . " To Conrad , there was something deeply pleasing about the mundanity of his morning routine with Rollo , its repetitive , unchanging nature . He would have been disappointed if , having hauled on his stiff black waders , Rollo had n't promptly struggled out of them again , announcing that he needed to relieve himself-the click of the chest straps acting as some kind of Pavlovian trigger that also spared him the chore of loading the gear . The equipment was stored in a barn behind the house . Windblown sand had banked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up out of the ground , pushing its way through the soft mantel . The barn 's clean hard lines belied the muddle inside . Continues ...
