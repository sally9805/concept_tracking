The idea seemed reasonable enough . Faced with an onslaught of Palestinian suicide bombers , Israel decided to build a barrier between itself and the West Bank . A similar wall around the Gaza Strip has ensured that no bomber has crossed from Gaza into Israel in the past three years . But the exact placement of the new fence is causing concern . Instead of following the Green Line  --  the demarcation that existed before Israel conquered the West Bank in 1967 and the line Palestinian leaders imagine as a border for their future state  --  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon pushed the fence inside the West Bank to include many Israeli settlements . According to the U.N. , the fence , about a quarter of which is built , already puts 16% of the West Bank and 13,000 Palestinians on the Israeli side . President Bush last month warned Israel not to " prejudice " peace talks by building " walls and fences . " Israeli officials say they will move the cordon if a different border is eventually negotiated . Palestinians are deeply skeptical.  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
