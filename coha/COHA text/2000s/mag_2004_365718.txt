The first 10 days after birth can be a risky time for newborns and their mothers . Indeed , some babies sent home after delivery end up right back in the hospital , often with jaundice or dehydration , both preventable conditions . In a new study published in the journal Pediatrics , Dr. Ian Paul , a Penn State College of Medicine pediatrician , reports that a simple home visit by a nurse can reduce by about 90% a baby 's risk of getting sent back to the hospital . Of the 2,641 babies in his study who did n't get a house call , 2.8% were readmitted within 10 days , and 3.5% went to the emergency room . Among 326 newborns who were seen by a nurse , however , only 0.6% were readmitted to the hospital , and none ended up in the E.R.
