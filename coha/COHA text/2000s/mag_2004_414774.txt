Field-tested clothing systems for every region of the country // YOU CAN GET a custom-tailored suit and a custom home . But not until BACKPACKER 'S 14th annual Apparel Guide could you get a customized layering system . We asked our testers to design the perfect set of clothes for four regions : Mountain West , East/Midwest , Southwest , and Northwest . We gathered more than 100 of the latest layers , from shirts to shells , and hiked , skied , climbed , and paddled in them for 6 months . In assembling the systems , we kept an eye on value ; the average cost for five key pieces is about $500 . We also placed a premium on versatility ; while each system is optimized for a certain area , you wo n't need a whole new wardrobe when you venture to the other side of the continent . MOUNTAINS WEST CONDITIONS Rigorous ascents and wild weather swings thanks to dramatic elevation profiles in the Sierra Nevada and Rocky Mountains ; chilly nights and strong winds are prevalent up high ; snow is possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep , sustained climbs in variable weather ; and a puffy down midlayer for those colder high camps By Steve Howe * MONTBELL ZEOLINE 3D ZIP-SHIRT Super-wicky and athletically cut , the ZeoLine is perfect for hard-charging days in any weather . The light-but-lofty synthetic fabric provided good insulation and stayed dry as the only layer under a shell while one tester skied through a 6-hour snowstorm in the northern Rockies . The fit does n't bind or twist up , and I appreciated the loose cut around the neck , protective but unobtrusive midheight collar , and venting zipper . Great comfort and low weight in a core layer-that 's huge . $45 ; XS-XL ; 6 oz . Contact : ( 866 ) 546-6824 ; www. montbell.com . Reader service #101. * MOUNTAIN HARDWEAR MICRO CHILL ZIP T Basic fleece is so yesterday-or so I thought until this Polartec 100 pullover kept ending up in my pack trip after trip . Here 's why : It 's warm for its low weight and bulk , providing impressive insulation even during chilly spring hailstorms , and it fits superbly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and dries fast , making it a great layering piece on high-exertion , cold-weather days . When combined with a light windshell , it was perfect for spring storms high in Death Valley 's Grapevine Range . Detailing is superb , from the snug cuffs to the no-snag chest zipper and chest pocket . $70 ; men 's S-XL , women 's 6-14 ; 7 OZ , Contact : ( 800 ) 953-8375 ; www.mountainhardwear.com . Reader service #102. * MOONSTONE LUCID JACKET High alpine camps and windy ridgetop lunch stops felt like BaJa beach days in this bundle of 800-fill-power down . The diamond-pattern quilting prevents the plumes from shifting , and the thin ripstop polyester shell keeps the package light without coughing up a feather . The Lucid stuffs down to softball proportions , yet sports mountain-specific features : zippered hand-warmer pockets lined with microfleece , a high collar , a waist drawstring , and two inside pockets big enough for hot water bottles . The snag : The shell does n't repel showers well . $160 ; men 's S-XL , women 's S-L ; 11 oz . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ service #103. * GOLITE PHANTOM JACKET Racing a storm to a peak is no time to whip out an inferior rain shell . This 12-ounce tester fave wo n't let you down . The Gore-Tex PacLite is highly breathable , and the addition of pit zips and venting mesh pockets makes it perfect for sweaty ascents , as I found sledhauling on Mt . McKinley , climbing in the Sierra , and backcountry skiing in Utah . The featherweight shell does n't sacrifice other details ; there 's a fully adjustable hood , streamlined hook-and-loop cuffs that still seal tight , an athletic cut for easy mobility , and spacious pockets positioned with climbing harnesses and hipbelts in mind . $200 ; men 's S-XL , women 's S-L ; 12 oz . Contact : ( 888 ) 546-5483 ; www.golite.com . Reader service #104. * ARC'TERYX SWITCHBACK PANTS These stretch-woven pants are made for alpine life , yet the spare design looks art-gallery chic . They proved cool enough to replace shorts on bluebird spring days , yet warded off chill wind and sleet in Colorado 's Elk Range . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lightest pants in the test , while beating back brush , thorns , and sandstone butt-grind . Despite the scant weight , you get two thigh pockets with waterproof zips . The snag : A zip-fly would sure speed up pit stops . $150 ; men 's S-XL , women 's XS-L ; 9 oz .

EAST/MIDWEST CONDITION Humid weathear , frequent summer thunderstorms , chilly nights in the Northeast during spring and fall KEY SOLUTIONS Cool , quick-drying convertible pants , a warm synthetic-fill jacket , and a bargain rain shell that wo n't make you sweat the air conditioning bill at home By Jonathan Dorn and Dennis Lewon * MARMOT INFINITY SILKWEIGHT CREW The unmatched inner softness of the Infinity makes this a versatile next-to-skin layer for the wide temperature swings of the East and Midwest . It took the sting out of early March weather on the AT , wicked super-fast in moderate temps , and is the best sleepshirt we 've used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it without a shell on a drizzly 550F day in the Catskills . We like the crew for its athletic cut and low a bulk , but a zip-neck with collar is also available . $32 ; men 's S-XL , women 's XS-XL ; 7 oz . Contact : ( 707 ) 544-4590 ; www.marmot.com . Reader service #115. * PATAGONIA AXUWOOL HOODY You know you 've found a critical piece of clothing when it 's never in your closet . This midlayer spent 6 months alternating between pack , workout bag , and laundry basket . It 's warm for its weight thanks to a wool inner lining and hood , yet wicks and dries well due to the polyester outer ; the combo was perfect for early spring hiking through Pennsylvania 's cold hardwood forests and great for camp lounging in milder temps , when the hood let us leave a hat behind . The wool liner also kept stink in check . $115 ; men 's S-XL , women 's XS-L ; il oz . Contact : ( 800 ) 638-6464 ; www.patagonia.com .

That 's why we prefer the proprietary synthetic insulation in the Stratus , which never felt clammy and always lofted back to original strength within minutes of unpacking . The parka 's relaxed cut slides easily over midlayers ( but cinches at the waist for draftproofing ) , its hood snugs around a thick wool cap , and the thumb loops kept the sleeves from creeping up on an unexpectedly frigid Shenandoah spring hike . Pockets are deep , warm , and plentiful ; one doubles as a grapefruit-size stuff sack . $135 ; XS-XXL ; 1 ib . Contact : ( 802 ) 985-5056 , www.mammut.ch . Reader service #117. * EMS THUNDERHEAD You do n't have to be a direct Mayflower descendant to appreciate a little Yankee thrift . EMS taps a universal love of value with this $79 bargain . The low hem wo n't ride up in stormy weather , drawcords and zipper guards seal out the wet , and four chest pockets provide plenty of stash capacity without interfering with your hipbelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expensive fabrics , but easy-to-operate pit zips minimize overheating . The snag : While the roll-down hood has three-point adjustment for a noggin-hugging fit , a stiffer brim would be welcome in sustained downpours. $79 ; men 's S-XXL , women 's XS-XL ; 14 oz . Contact : ( 888 ) 463-6367 ; www.ems.com . Reader service #118. * MOUNTAIN HARDWEAR DIVERSION PANTS The Diversion 's lightweight synthetic Canyon Cloth was cool against the skin on muggy summer days , tough against rocks and brambles , and quick to dry after a passing squall . And that 's just the fabric . These convertibles also raise the bar for zip-off style with their concealed zippers and minimalist pockets . The waist 's conical cut and integral belt do n't sag or bunch under a loaded hipbelt , and the waistband 's microfleece lining moves sweat . The snag : The front pockets are a tad shallow . $75 ; men 's S-XXL , women 's 4-14 ; 12 oz . Contact : ( 800 ) 953-8375 ; www.mountainhardwear.com .

Believe it . This superfine merino wool is cool and breathable when traversing sunny slickrock benches , yet insulates against freezer-temp slot canyons in spring and autumn . The stretchy merino feels silky soft against the skin-no matter how much you sweat-and even after 5 days of hot sand-slogging through Utah 's Paria Canyon , my Woolies did n't smell gamey . The snag : High maintenance . The gossamer fabric showed wear early , so you 'll want to limit the wash cycles and hang-dry it to extend its life . $56 ; men 's S-XXL , women 's S-XL ; 5 oz. women 's L ) Contact : ( 800 ) 773-9647 ; www.ibexwear.com .

The Wister 's Polarteo Wind Pro Hardface fabric-smooth and abrasion-resistant outside , warm and fuzzy inside-shed the meanest wind and light drizzle , while breathing well enough to m prevent overheating . The generously long vest does n't ride up under a hipbelt , and the 2-inch-tall collar is like a built-in neck gaiter . Details include hand-warmer pockets , chest g pocket , hem drawcord , and Power Stretch under the arms for enhanced breathability . It 's 1 not the cheapest vest available , just the smartest. $130 ; men 's S-XL , women 's XS-L ; 11 oz. ( women 's Lj Contact : ( 877 ) 255-8345 ; www.cloudveil.com .

This 700-fill-power down pullover weighs just 10 ounces and stuffs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like hand-warmer pockets and a full zip in favor of simplicity and compactness , which makes sense for desertfriendly insulation . Inch-wide baffles kept the down in place despite numerous stuffings , and the elastic cuffs and hem drawcord seal out drafts. $159 ; men 's XS-XL ; 10 oz .

Header service #108. * SIERRA DESIGNS HURRICANE LT The recent drought years notwithstanding , it does rain in the Southwest , so you 'd be unwise to forgo a shell entirely . But you 'd be downright foolish to carry a heavy or expensive jacket . The Hurricane LT is the most affordable 12-ounce shell we 've tested . It 's super compact , has vents in the forearms to minimize overheating , and two hand pockets positioned well above your hipbelt . The short hem and two-point adjustable hood are basic but adequate . The snag : The fabric is n't highly breathable , and the inner surface gets sticky when wet . $75 ; men 's S-XXL , women 's S-XL ; 12 oz . Contact : ( 800 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.L. BEAN TRAIL CARGO ZIP-OFF PANTS Ignore the Crocodile Hunter jokes and get a pair of convertible pants . Zip-offs save weight and pack space , and are the perfect solution when mild desert weather makes you question bringing pants at all . This bargain pair makes the grade because of a heat-friendly fit that 's loose for venting but not too baggy , and the quick-drying Supplex nylon , which did n't shred even when snagged on thorns . Other perks : beaucoup pocket space ; a belt ; long ankle zippers for removing pants over big boots ; and tags identifying left and right legs . $49 ; men 's S-XL , inseams 30 , 32 , 34 , women 's even sizes 4-20 , inseams 28 , 30 , 32 ; 1 Ib .

The 8-inch chest zipper provides adequate ventilation . The snag : It 's the warmest , but also the heaviest . $35 ; men 's S-XL , women 's XS-L ; 9 02 , Contact : ( 800 ) 953-8375 ; www.mountainhardwear.com . Reader service #111. * THE NORTH FACE APEX ZIP SHIRT In a region where iffy weather is the rule , it pays to have a versatile outer/midlayer like the Apex . This lightweight , stretchy soft-shell shirt fends off cold wind and moderate precip , and the synthetic fabric holds up against even abrasive rock . While it does n't breathe as well or dry as quickly as some soft shells , it 's lighter and less expensive than most . The snag : It 's heavy , and needs a drawcord at the hem to thwart drafts. $89 ; men 's S-XL , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : ( 800 ) 362-4963 ; www.thenorthface.com . Reader service #112. * OUTDOOR RESEARCH MICRO DOWN SWEATER In some corners of the Northwest , summer starts july 4 and ends july 5-so skimp on insulation at your own risk . I take no chances with this 800-fill-power toaster . The elastic cuffs and hem keep the chill out , the big front tube pocket warms chilled hands , and the water-resistant shell makes this a legit Northwest jacket by keeping feathers from wilting on misty mornings . The snag : It does n't stuff as small as the other down jackets we tested . $149 ; men 's S-XL , women 's XS-XL ; I Ib. 2 oz .

I used the Switchbacks from fair-weather hiking in Hells Canyon to aerobic skate-skiing in 2O0F to climbing a 14,000-foot peak in May . The stretchy Schoeller Dynamic fabric shed light rain , and even held up to butt glissades on abrasive corn snow . The waistband 's soft tricot lining belies its sturdy construction . $165 ; men 's S-XL , women 's XS-L ; 14 oz . Contact : ( 877 ) 255-8345 ; www. cloudveil.com . Reader service #114 .
