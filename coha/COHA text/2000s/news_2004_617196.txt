<p> Most mornings you can find former Senate leader Wayne Garner on the third floor of the Capitol , leaning back against a railing , laughing and telling tales beside former House Banking Chairman Charlie Watts . <p> Nearby , one-time Senate Minority Leader Arthur " Skin " Edge or former House Judiciary Chairman Tommy Chambless might be bending the ear of a legislator , and former Senate Majority Leader Pete Robinson might be down the hall working his cellphone . <p> Usually within eyesight will be ex-Secretary of State Lewis Massey , former Natural Resources Commissioner Joe Tanner or erstwhile Public Service Commissioner Jim Hammock . <p> Legislative sessions are a homecoming of sorts for the one-time decision makers of Georgia . Every year , those who retired  --  or got retired by voters  --  return to the site of their political exploits to see if their sway holds on the other side of the velvet rope that separates legislators from lobbyists . <p> About four dozen former legislators and top state officials are registered to prowl the halls of the Capitol as lobbyists this session , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to some estimates , more than double the number 10 years ago . <p> ' Revolving door ' <p> Gov . Sonny Perdue has filed ethics legislation aimed at slowing down the " revolving door " of lawmakers and top state officials leaving public service to become lobbyists immediately , proposing a one-year waiting period . More than a dozen states have similar laws or rules , as does Congress . However , such legislation has been talked about , and filed , for years , without success . Some argue that 's because lawmakers would be voting against their self-interest . <p> " Their retirements are not a mystery to them . They know when they are going to retire , " said Neill Herring , a longtime environmental lobbyist . " They are in a position while they are in office to feather their nests for when they are out of office . " <p> House Judiciary Chairman Tom Bordeaux ( D-Savannah ) , whose committee has handled ethics legislation in the past , said that a waiting period has been a difficult sell for lawmakers . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who are well-versed , well-trained on certain issues , " Bordeaux said . " To exclude them would be to lose valuable assets . <p> " On the other hand , there is a distinct odor that comes when someone goes from voting for a bill one day to being paid to lobby for it the next . The danger is that the legislator or bureaucrat starts looking after his future income and his retirement plans when he 's being paid to look after the public 's interest . " <p> For instance , environmentalists such as Herring were concerned last year when Harold Reheis retired from his job as the state 's chief environmental regulator and went to work in Tanner 's lobbying firm . <p> But Reheis ' move was far from unusual . Ex-lawmakers routinely show up at the Capitol to lobby colleagues before their replacements have even been sworn in for their old seats in the House and Senate . <p> The tradition of lawmakers becoming lobbyists continued after the 2002 elections . Among those who served in the 2002 session and came back to lobby were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jeff Williams and Tracy Stallings . In addition , former Rep. Danae Roberts works the Capitol for her former House colleague , state School Superintendent Kathy Cox . <p> Few have been as successful as Robinson and Edge . They were on opposing sides on many political debates during the early 1990s , one representing the Democrats , the other the Republicans . Now , their lobbying firms represent some of the biggest interests at the Capitol . <p> Robinson and his team of lobbyists represent such major insurance companies as Aetna , AFLAC and Cigna Healthcare of Georgia , financial companies such as Synovus and other big businesses and groups , including General Motors , General Electric , Microsoft , Verizon Wireless and the Home Builders Association of Georgia . <p> Edge represents public interests , including the state Supreme Court and DeKalb County CEO Vernon Jones , but also Turner Broadcasting , American Express , Children 's Healthcare of Atlanta , the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Cash America , a " payday loan " business . <p> Quick return <p> Watts left the Legislature in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few months after losing the election , he was back at the Capitol representing some of the folks he helped regulate , bankers . Today he lobbies for the Georgia Industrial Loan Association and the Community Bankers Association of Georgia . <p> Lobbying is a business built on relationships , bonds between lobbyists and lawmakers . However , what people do n't understand , Watts said , is that it 's not a relationship of equals . Once you 're no longer a legislator , you ca n't do much for ex-colleagues other than provide them accurate information . You ca n't vote for their bill or help them get funding for some local project , he said . <p> Lobbyists can give money to lawmakers , but neither Watts nor Garner , also a bank lobbyist , are big contributors . <p> Watts gave a total of $500 last year . Garner has given $2,300 over three years , mostly to such statewide officials as former Gov . Roy Barnes , Lt. Gov . Mark Taylor and Attorney General Thurbert Baker . <p> Watts said he has no problem with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know that it will make a difference , " he said . <p> Neither does Sen. George Hooks ( D-Americus ) , who has supported ethics legislation in the past . <p> " These are people who know the subjects , know the process , " Hooks said . " I do n't think a waiting period matters . I do n't see a big abuse over here . I will listen to somebody I can trust who knows the subject . " <p> Garner , now mayor of Carrollton , also served as head of the state Department of Corrections . He said he took a self-imposed waiting period after leaving office before becoming a lobbyist . <p> " There is just so much room for mischief , " Garner said . " Lobbying is two things : knowing the process and relationships . That 's all you 're selling . <p> " If you 've been a legislator voting on bills one day and start lobbying the next , you 're at a distinct advantage . " <p> On average , Garner estimated , lobbyists make in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " Most get about six clients , make $150,000 to $200,000 a year , " he said . That 's 10 times what they make serving in the Legislature , although being a lawmaker is considered a part-time job . <p> Rep. Pat Gardner ( D-Atlanta ) lobbied for the Georgia Psychological Association for years before winning election to the state House in 2001 . She said lobbying made her a better-prepared legislator because she understood how the system worked . <p> Still , she supports a one-year waiting period before lawmakers can become lobbyists . <p> " I think anything we can do to enhance the image of public service , we should do , " Gardner said . " I do n't think it 's asking too much to wait a year . " Nearly 50 former legislators and state officials are lobbying at the Capitol this session . Here are some of them , with former titles and current clients : <p> * Charlie Watts , House Banking Committee chairman  --  Georgia Industrial Loan Association , Independent Funeral Directors of Georgia Inc. , Community Bankers Association of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Resources commissioner  --  MCI , IBM , Emory University , Georgia Association of Mortgage Brokers , BFI . <p> * Pete Robinson , Senate majority leader  --  Aetna , AFLAC , General Motors , General Electric , Microsoft , Verizon Wireless , Southern Co .
