Rafael ( Ricardo Darin ) runs a prosperous , but crisis-ridden restaurant , his ex-wife is a shrew , his daughter and his girlfriend are variously estranged , and now his aged father wants to remarry his mother in the church wedding he refused her 44 years ago . Trouble is , Mom ( the great Norma Aleandro ) has Alzheimer 's , and the church is dubious about the ceremony . Heart attack and midlife crisis are , naturally , Rafael 's lot . Ours is pure pleasure as he works his way toward a more contented state in this wry , richly layered , wonderfully observed Argentine film . <P>  --  R.S.
