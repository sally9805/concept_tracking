JONATHAN ZHU <P> MORGAN STANLEY CHINA , HONG KONG <P> Jonothan Zhu , chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley China , calls himself an " accidental banker "  --  and for good reason . In the late 1980s , the Shanghai-born Zhu was studying the poetry of William Wordsworth in a Ph.D . program at New York 's Cornell University . Wordsworth , he says , wrote his best work during the French Revolution , a period Zhu felt reflected his own experience in Mao 's China . But in 1988 , Zhu 's life changed forever when he joined other Chinese studying abroad on a special tour of his home country , organized by the communist government . He met farmers and fishermen , visited the new Volkswagen factory in Shanghai and realized for the first time how rapidly China was changing under the economy 's new market reforms . " There was a tremendous amount of tension in China , " Zhu says . " There was a lot of dislocation , but people were n't seeing the benefits yet . " <P> When he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I wanted to be involved , " Zhu recalls . " I wanted to do something more useful than studying poetry written by a dead person . " He took a leave from the doctorate program  --  never to return  --  shifted into law school and in 1995 joined Morgan Stanley as an investment banker . Since then , Zhu , 42 , has made himself very , very useful to the Chinese economy . Morgan Stanley has raised $20 billion for Chinese companies , mainly through initial public offerings of stock , and Zhu has been involved in nearly all of them , including mobile-phone-service provider China Unicom , Ping An Insurance and oil giant Sinopec . Zhu has an additional $10 billion in deals in the pipeline . He also hooked up France 's Thomson with Chinese electronics company TCL  --  a deal that in 2004 created the world 's largest television maker after it merged both companies ' TV-manufacturing businesses under TCL management . <P> Zhu believes that the deals he has done have helped Chinese businessmen become savvier , smarter competitors . He recalls working with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its revenue and employed teams of workers to match used plane tickets and payment receipts by hand . Now , he says , Chinese executives can talk high finance with the world 's best . " Chinese executives have become much more sophisticated , " he says . " The level of understanding of accounting and financial concepts had been much lower . " Still , Zhu realizes that Chinese firms face steep hurdles in international business , especially with foreign acquisitions . Chinese firms , he says , are figuring out how to handle foreign workers and woo big-name customers . Penetrating foreign markets is " a matter of trust , " Zhu says . " It 's not as simple as having a product that is cheaper than everybody else's. "  --  By Michael Schuman/ Hong Kong
