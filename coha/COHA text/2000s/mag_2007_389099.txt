Headnote Should children as young as 11 be forced to choose a profession ? Megan Fisher started seriously thinking about her future when her teacher in grade six launched into a unit on careers . " It was interesting most of the time , hut in a way it also kind of hummed me out , " recalls Megan . " He said , " If you do n't know what you want to do in life , how are you going to do anything ? ' I definitely started to feel some pressure about what path to take . " Now in grade nine , the 14-year-old from Aurora , Ont. , has struggled to narrow her broad range of interests down to three specific , albeit rather disparate , areas : custom home building , journalism and cooking . Her mother , Jackie , an entrepreneur who never gave much thought to her own career options until she was 19 or 20 , is concerned about the " job stress " her daughter is facing . " I was thinking , " Gee , she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who later realized there must be millions of similarly career-stressed kids when she learned that the world 's bestselling careerplanning hook scries came out in 2006 with a junior version : What Color is Your Parachute ? For Teens : Discovering Yourself , Defining Your Future . So what 's driving schools to force preteens and young teens to choose a career , and are these kids really benefiting from limiting their options so soon ? NARROW FOCUS Adults have always delighted in asking children : " What do you want to be when you grow up ? " But there 's a rising trend in schools toward pushing students at younger and younger ages to narrow their career choices . To that end , kids as young as grade seven and eight are slogging through thick course manuals or complex online curricula , to select the courses they think they 'll need and drop the ones they wo n't . By grade 10 , students in British Columbia may choose one of eight program streams , such as business and marketing , fitness and recreation , or humanities . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , students must choose one of three " pathways to graduation . " The movement toward narrowing choices is continent-wide : Last year , Florida passed a bill requiring students to declare a major in high school . " It 's a pretty pervasive trend and it 's putting a lot of pressure on children , " says Bryan Hiebert , a University of Calgary professor of applied psychology in the faculty of education with an expertise in career planning for youth . Hiebert says there 's nothing wrong with getting kids to think about career options - in fact , he 's ' in favour of it - but it 's something else entirely to push them into making choices before they 're ready . Hiebert says the pressure on kids is coming from many directions , including a success-driven society , overeager schools and well-meaning parents anxious to secure their children 's futures . " When I speak to groups of parents , I ask them how many had an idea by grade 11 what they wanted to be , and all the hands go up , " Hiebert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands up if that 's the career you 're in today . ' Out of 50 people , maybe two or three hands stay up . " WIDER VIEW It 's unrealistic for young teens to plan on lifelong careers , Hiebert says , since the average Canadian changes jobs every three years and undergoes a major occupational shift every five years . Moreover , he adds , many jobs of 10 or 15 years ago no longer exist , such as in skilled manufacturing , while many jobs today are relatively new , such as web design . And with the pace of change continuing , Hiebert says it 's counterproductive for kids to narrow their sights at a young age : " Today it 's not about making the best choice or the right choice , but making choices that allow you to be flexible and adaptable . The primary focus of young people up to age 18 or 20 should be exploration . " Still , the societal pressure for schools to become more job-oriented and relevant to today 's marketplace shows no signs of letting up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace a good general education , says Susan Qadeer of Toronto , a personal and career counsellor of teens and young adults for more than 30 years . First , a student who excels in one area , and narrowly focuses on that , may be at a loss if that option suddenly vanishes . Qadeer says , " I 've worked at universities where many of the 3,000 first-year science students want to become a doctor . Maybe 70 of them will get into med school , which leaves quite a few frantically scurrying for alternatives . " Related fields , such as health promotion , may be closed to them if they have n't developed their writing skills . Second , many students are academic late bloomers , discovering interests only after they 've already dropped important courses . For instance , a teen who likes physical activity and risk-taking may focus on gym , only to discover later on that he wants to be a firefighter or a paramedic , but he 's already dropped the necessary chemistry or biology courses , which may be difficult to pick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rebellious period right when they 're forced to make these life-altering decisions . So a strong-willed , music-loving girl who underachieves in math to defy her parents may later find she needs number skills to get into audio engineering . Qadeer recommends that , wherever possible , all students should take math , science and English right through high school . " The more general the preparation , " she says , " the better prepared students are for life . " BETTER GUIDANCE Many provinces have mandated careers courses designed to help students learn about career options and the workplace - in Ontario , for instance , it 's compulsory in grade 10 . But that offers just a taste . Qadeer suggests that information about careers be incorporated into every subject in the curriculum . For example , an art course , which may cover Canadian women artists , should also include information about art-related careers , such as computer animation or medical illustration . It 's wise for parents to have ongoing conversations with their kids about careers . " But do it informally , " says Joanne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who offers career counselling for teens . " Too much information can be overwhelming for them and a source of stress . " So do n't overload kids with a lot of specs about qualifications and ' salaries for various careers , says Simpson , who is also a former teacher and guidance counsellor . Help your kids , as well , to learn more about not just what kind of job , they want , but what kind of life they may want , says Simpson . Are they happier indoors or out ? Do they enjoy being on their own or with a group ? Do they prefer developing free-flowing ideas or following a structure ? Temperament is key . One child who loves drama may crave the thrill and uncertainty of an acting career , while another may prefer the security of being a drama teacher . " It 's good for kids , even young kids , to be thinking about the choices they 'll make , " Simpson says . " But do n't panic ! Help them see that the world is open to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learn how they want to fit into it . " That rarely happens at 13 .
