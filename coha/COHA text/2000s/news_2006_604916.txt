<p> The avian flu virus has spread across much of Asia and is making its way across Europe . Though fewer than 200 human cases have been reported , the global health community is closely monitoring its path with hopes of preventing a catastrophic pandemic . While only 1 in 3 Americans in a recent poll fear an infection from " bird flu , " health officials in the USA are working under the assumption that the virus will reach our shores , though not necessarily with disastrous results . Anthony Fauci , director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health , discussed the bird flu with USA TODAY 's editors and reporters . His comments were edited for length and clarity . <p> Question : Is bird flu likely to affect people in the United States ? And if it does , how will it arrive ? <p> Answer : I 'm less worried about a massive bird infection that then infects people in the United States , than I am of an influenza coming over here on an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know from Europe that if you have reasonably good controls , it is not impossible but unlikely that you 're going to have massive contamination of chickens ( from which the disease has spread to humans in poorer countries because of poor sanitation ) . What is more likely is if there 's a pandemic  --  and that 's a big if  --  and if this virus is genetically capable of evolving , an outbreak would more likely occur in a population of people  --  such as in Africa , Southeast Asia or India  --  where you have a massive contamination of chicken flocks , exposure of people , and enough people infected to give the virus the chance to evolve and spread from human to human . And once that happens , then it 's going to be spread the way you get influenza every year . <p> Q : How much warning would Americans likely have that a severe pandemic was going to affect them ? <p> A : There 's no way of knowing for sure , but it would probably be a matter of several weeks to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A : If the virus becomes more adaptable to humans and does n't spread as rapidly as the seasonal flu , you 'll see some doctors and health officials start to impose certain types of quarantines , restrictions on travel , and start vaccinating people around the country . These actions would be unlikely to stop the spread of the flu , but they could slow it down , which would give you weeks to months . <p> Q : It would take a while to create and manufacture the right vaccine . What would happen in the interim ? <p> A : If we immediately started cranking out more pre-pandemic vaccine , which is not a perfect match , we would have some effect on slowing things down . Then we 'd deploy that to the people who are on the priority list  --  people who make vaccines , health care workers , people with the highest risk with diseases . <p> Q : If initially there is n't enough vaccine for everyone , what else can be done ? <p> A : There are other very good public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social distancing , which really works . By social distancing we mean staying out of crowded places . When children get sick , you do n't send them to school . When people are sick , they do n't go to work . Organizations like your own should have ways of saying we ca n't exist with a cumulative 40% workforce absence , so when people get sick , tell them to go home and do everything from home . <p> Q : Is it likely that the flu would be severe enough to require such extreme measures ? <p> A : If you look historically , pandemic flu is n't necessarily all gloom and doom . There is an enormous spectrum of severity of pandemic flu . Pandemic means it 's widespread , and it 's a brand new virus to which you have had no contact . In 1918 , which is the worst-case scenario , more than 50 million people died . On the other end of the spectrum was 1968 , which was a pandemic because it was the first time we had seen H3N2 ( virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the normal , run-of-the-mill seasonal flu . We can have a pandemic that is something much , much less severe than the 1918 and still have a pandemic . <p> Q : Is there any way someone could become sick from eating an infected bird ? <p> A : It is unlikely to be gotten from eating chicken because it is clear that the virus is killed by cooking . If you cook chicken , it is going to kill the virus . <p> Q : What should people or companies be doing now , if anything ? <p> A : Have a plan . Just get yourself a plan . Each family unit should have some degree of preparedness for any disaster that would interrupt the normal supply of things that you and your family needs . Now , that could mean a few weeks worth of water , a few weeks worth of non-spoilable foods . More important to me is the people who have chronic diseases who rely on daily medications . They should have a couple of weeks ' supply of that around , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years ago , we had a shortage of flu vaccine that resulted in many older people waiting in long lines . Has there been any progress creating a more orderly distribution ? <p> A : We are not where we need to be for a widespread massive distribution of vaccine . Although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention holds a reserve supply for an emergency , a relatively small proportion of the seasonal flu vaccine is distributed . Each year , there 's a perception that we do n't have enough , and the reason is that the distribution of influenza vaccine is left fundamentally up to the private distributors . There is n't a uniform central body able to control the distribution . Whether that should be the federal government or a consortium of the companies , we 've got to work with each other to make sure there is even distribution . <p> Q : Why have n't we had a major health crisis with seasonal flu ? <p> A : It changes every year . Not enough for us to have a public health catastrophe , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is because the virus is ever evolving slowly . The reason there will never be a catastrophe with seasonal flu is that there is enough background immunity , or pre-exposure , for all of us . Even if you did n't get vaccinated , some of us may get sick , but there will not be a global public health catastrophe because there is enough background immunity . <p> Q : Why are n't flu vaccines developed and distributed as efficiently as prescription drugs are ? <p> A : Companies tend to make just enough or maybe even a little bit less than they need . They do n't like to make a surplus for the simple reason that unlike Lipitor , Crestor and Viagra , you ca n't make as much as you want , throw it in a warehouse , and it 's good for many years . It 's good for a couple of months and then it 's gone . That 's the real problem . <p> Q : Is part of the reason so few companies are in the vaccine business because of the economic uncertainty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enterprise because the incentive for companies who have a lot of money to invest in research and development and production is very low when you 're dealing with a product that is not used every day and which the American culture views almost as an entitlement . Americans are willing to pay $3,600 a year for Lipitor and $2,700 a year for Viagra , yet they become very concerned when they 're asked to pay any more than $20 for a one-time vaccine . This does not escape the companies ' perception . Then add all of the other disincentives . So companies do n't want to get involved a ) in vaccine or b ) in influenza vaccine . <p> Q : If you discover that there is evidence of person-to-person transmission , say , in Africa , and scores of people are dying , would you send our stockpiles of pre-pandemic vaccines over there to try to help them and isolate the virus ? Or would we just hunker down ? <p> A : Once the horse gets out of the barn , you are not going to stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) clustering cases , we have agreed with the World Health Organization that we will participate in a common stockpile deployment with other countries . When you are dealing with the number of doses that we have of pre-pandemic ( vaccine ) , it is a drop in the bucket of what you 'd need . So , if all of a sudden you have thousands of people in Africa who are infected , it does n't make any difference what you do there . They are in serious trouble . <p> Q : What would it take for this virus to become highly efficient and spread from person to person ? <p> A : The one thing I can say is that you often hear that we 're one mutation away from having a pandemic that spreads everywhere . Well , yes and no . Let me concentrate on the " no . " That implies that it 's a very simple event to get a virus that is very poorly transmissible to become highly transmissible . No , a lot of different things have to happen to that virus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient to highly efficient . Now , health officials like myself have to assume a ) that will happen and b ) it will be a worst-case scenario because you have to gear up your preparation . But when the American public gets up in the morning and goes to work , they should not be fixating that we 're one mutation away from disaster . PHOTOS , B/W , H. Darr Beiser , USA TODAY ( 3 )
