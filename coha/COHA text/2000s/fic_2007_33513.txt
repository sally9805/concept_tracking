1 The beige Nissan pulled slowly down 213th Street . It was a quiet , tree-lined neighborhood , where most people had manicured lawns and minded their own business . That 's what Jacob Reese loved immediately about the neighborhood and that 's why he decided to rent a one-family home on the block . Here he could blend into the background of the clapboard-and aluminum-sided homes , with their playing kids , their azalea bushes and maple leaf trees . Jacob was ready to start a new life . But what happened just a few hours before could possibly upend all of his plans . He pulled into the driveway of his home . With the engine still running , he just sat in his car . Beads of sweat were still forming on his brow , threatening to run streaks down his face . The adrenaline rush was beginning to dissipate , and Jacob was tumbling down -- crashing down . It was like coming off a crack high . He sat motionless for a moment , then grabbed the steering wheel with both hands , squeezing it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his forearms . He embraced the sensation . As he gripped the steering wheel , Jacob shut his eyes as hard as he could . He wanted to stop the shaking . He wanted to squeeze out the guilt that was rushing through his body like a roaring rapid . " That bitch ! That bitch ! That fucking bitch ! ! ! ! " Jacob cried out at the top of hislungs . One neighbor next door turned off the light to his front room and peeked out the window through the blinds to see what the screaming was about . In typical New York fashion , he decided the screaming was not quite piercing enough to rate a call to 911 . He closed the blinds and went to bed . Jacob put on the black baseball cap that was in the passenger seat and prepared to go inside . He sat for a minute and reflected on what he had just done . He already regretted it . But it was over . He was mad at himself , but he was FURIOUS at Ritz Harper for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people would gladly pay to see her dead . He hated being so desperate that when the call came and the money was offered he jumped at the chance . Jacob Reese was a lot of things , but he was no killer . He decided to do the thing he did best . He buried the thoughts he was having . Jacob was cursed with an uncanny ability to be totally delusional . He could fool himself into thinking anything he wanted . As a result , he did n't have many friends and he had n't achieved anything in life . Jacob wanted to be a megaproducer in the music industry . He believed he could be the next P. Diddy or Rodney Jerkins . He could see it . He knew it . Of course he could . He was delusional . The closest Jacob had ever come to living his dream was when he contributed eight bars to a new artist 's first single . The first time he heard the finished product , Jacob convinced himself that he was the next Quincy Jones . Jacob was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ places , going to the right parties , trying to hobnob with the right people . He partied like he owned Motown in 1968 . He dressed the part . He looked the part . But the fronting was wearing thin on his psyche and his wallet . A woman can tell if a man is broke -- it 's in her DNA , like the mothering instinct -- even if you give her all the X she can handle . Jacob had a steady supply , but not an eternal supply . One day , the keg of ecstacy would run dry , and he knew it . That was why he was desperate . Jacob was determined to get to " the top "  - -  whatever that meant -- but he was n't going to get there by being on the bottom of some powerful man . He was not going to be that new bitch ; he was going to scratch and claw the hard way and make it on his own . Being a new bitch in the record industry was n't much different from being a new inmate in a small cell on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rep or Wendy Williams and Karen Hunter street credibility or much muscle or hustle , or without somebody watching your back , you are open to being eaten for lunch -- literally . In the music business , if you come in new without any rep , or anybody who will stand up for you and have your back , you are subject to being the next Bentley the Butler , with an emphasis on the bent part , as in bent over and drilled in the butt by any mega rapper/rap mogul . There are lots of Bentley the Butlers in the music business , and very few of them actually get to be anything but . Very few of them ever get that career in the business outside of being a Bentley . In the record industry , just like in jail , you either bend over and take it , hoping for the best , or you find another way . Jacob was determined to find that way . He already had an asshole that worked just fine . He did n't need to be ripped another one . Jacob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeed ... He got out of the car and scooted discreetly into his house . He smiled as he looked at the copy of Confessions of a Video Vixen on the floor of his bedroom , a book about one of those " star fuckers " whose claim to fame was that she knew how Shaq 's , Jay-Z 's , Vin Diesel 's , and Ja Rule 's dicks tasted -- just like chicken ! A good read , he thought . When I make it , I will have to look that bitch up . He also wondered when the male version of that book was going to come out . Video hos were n't only females . Jacob flipped open his cell phone and dialed . This particular number was n't stored in his phone and it never would be . It was a number he was to use only once , and he had to memorize it . He hesitated before dialing the number . He could n't remember the last time he had to remember a phone number by heart . The person on the other end picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's good ? " the voice spoke . " It 's done , " said Jacob . " Good ! " Jacob heard a click on the other end of the line . He knew that things were set . This was his first hit and he hoped it would be his last . He was n't cut out for real shooting . He had threatened a few people but never carried it out . He had broken a few arms and legs , cracked some ribs , but he had never killed anyone . He never had a real good incentive to do so . Not even rage could bring Jacob to actually shoot somebody . But desperation and money could . He was promised two hundred and fifty thousand dollars in cash . He had plans for his money , big plans . He was going to buy real estate and become the ultimate slumlord . He would sit back , collect fat rent checks every month , and pursue his music career . If that did n't work out , he would focus on buying more real estate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifestyle he felt he deserved . He did n't want to be greedy . He did n't want to go to jail . He just wanted to have the last laugh when the semisuccessful crew he occasionally hung out with ran through all of their money and he was sitting on his , a mini Donald Trump , minus the comb-over , wallowing in dough . Money , hos , and clothes all a nigga knows . Jacob had a year of college under his belt , so he knew he would also have to get some sort of job to make it all legitimate . He needed to make his quarter of a million dollars clean before he tried to use it . He needed benefits . He had some dental issues that needed attending to . All those years wearing gold fronts had compromised his bottom teeth . He had at least four cavities that needed filling , and he wanted to get that Zoom whitening treatment that would make his teeth ten shades whiter , or so the advertisement said . Jacob , in his delusional way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked . He knew that women liked men who smelled good , had nice arms and circumcised dicks . He also knew that women LOVED men who had good teeth . Once he had the money , he had to find a dentist . Tight balls were always trumped by lousy teeth ! He walked over to the pull-up bar in his bedroom doorway and took down the new suit he had hung there while he was in a rush to get to Manhattan for this job . It was a black Hugo Boss suit , shirt , and tie , still in the garment bag . It brought a smile to his face . He always wanted a nice suit . So he splurged before this job and got it in anticipation of his big payday . " I want to look fly when I pick up my money , " he said to himself . " I want to look like new money . " He hung the suit up in his tiny closet that was filled with mostly oversized polo shirts , khakis , and jeans . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hell , I 'm in my thirties now . It 's about time I start to look like a grown-ass man . " There was nothing childlike about his body . He did n't have a gym membership , but he regularly did calisthenics in his home . He reached up and began to do pull-ups unconsciously , losing count of how many he did , thinking only of his money -- the money that would buy him his freedom , and his new teeth , and his new clothes , and the world , and all the wonders in it .
