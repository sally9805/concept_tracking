Baby love . Post-baby lust . And ... baby number two ? CELINE DION spills all the juicy details of her life as a mom-and her next big career step . By Claire Connors // LET 'S GET ONE THING STRAIGHT ABOUT CELINE DION : IT 'S ALL AOUT the baby . Sure , the 34-year-old singer 's career is taing off again . She has a new album , New Day Has Come , which came out in March and a big CBS specialairing on April 7 , and she plans to star fpr three years in a Las Vegas spectacular , created by Cirque du Soled design genius Franco Dragone , beginning in 2003 . But right now the surprisingly candid Canadian , who splits her time between homes ( OK , palaces ) in Montreal and Jupiter , Florida , wants everyone to know that she 's just like any other new mother : completely obsessed with the new love of her life , 1-yearold Rene-Charles . " It was a miracle , " says Celine of her son 's birth . And indeed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and her husband-manager , Rene Angelil . In March 1999 , Celine had just turned 31 and was ready to start a family when Rene was diagnosed with a rare form of skin cancer . " I would n't have fallen apart if I did n't have a child , " Celine says , " but even so , it was something I wanted . " So the couple decided to have some of Rene 's sperm frozen in case chemotherapy rendered him sterile . Over the next few months , Rene and Celine concentrated on Rene 's health . After a successful surgery and 38 torturous chemo and radiation sessions , the couple turned their attention to having a baby and contacted a fertility specialist to discuss their options . He suggested a new in vitro method involving the injecting of one sperm into an egg and then placing the fertilized embryo in the uterus . After Celine received a battery of hormone shots to pump up her egg production , her eggs were removed and fertilized , and then three were placed in her womb . Two weeks later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news : They were pregnant on the very first try . And Rene was now cancer-free . A year later being a mother to Rene-Charles , or R.C. , as he is sometimes called , is everything Celine had hoped for . Photograph Photograph The comeback : Celine made her first public appearances at two benefits for the victims of the September 11 terrorist attacks , one in New York and this one , in Montreal . // The youngest of 14 children , Celine had always dreamed of having her own child , but baby lust never diminished her career lust . Born into a family of singers and musicians in Charlemagne , Quebec , Celine began performing at the tender age of 5 and at 12 was introduced to manager Rene Angelil . He was so impressed by her talent , he mortgaged his house to finance her debut album , which was , as we all know , a hit in Canada . " She was very determined , " recalls Rene , 60 . " She actually saw her career bigger than I did . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't see how she could be a star in the United States without speaking English . " After three months of intensive language lessons , Celine landed a contract with CBS , which is now Sony Music . What happened to the pair next is legendary : Despite the 26-year age difference , Celine and the twice-divorced Rene felt in love and , after a six-year courtship , were married in 1994 . The next few years were a whirlwind of career successes for Celine : sold-out shows all over the world and record-breaking sales ( she is the only singer to have two albums in a row sell more than 30 million copies ) , culminating with her 1998 hit , " My Heart Will Go On , " from the Titanic soundtrack . But in December 1999 , Celine bid adieu to her fans at a soldout farewell performance in Montreal , and she and Rene hunkered down to focus on their private life . That she would actually retire was never in the cards-at least according to Celine . The famously committed singer knew she would eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new album and a worldwide promotional tour , she 's coming back with a vengeance . While her feisty son squeals delightfully in the background , Celine talks honestly and openly about how her love life , marriage , and career have changed over the last year . Is she really just like any other new working mom ? Absolutely , except for one tiny detail : The woman actually likes to change diapers . When you left show business back in 1999 , was it ever on your mind that you might never come back ? I wanted a long vacation and to work on having a child , but it was never " Bye-bye , see ya , ciao ! " I was ready for a normal life for a little while , and I 'm so glad I did it . But only six months after Rene-Charles was born , you started working on a new album . Was that a difficult decision ? Singing is not work for me . We went to the studio in Montreal , and we recorded during the day . Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stocked with a crib , a TV , and toys . Rene-Charles was there every day . It was an incredible experience just singing and knowing he was so nearby . Recording is only one part of the job , though . You 're about to start the real work : interviews , photo shoots , touring . Are you ready for that ? To be honest with you , I 'm not . Being a mother is another life . You 're at home and you 're with your child , playing with the toys , changing diapers . Life becomes all about the real stuff ; the rest is n't as important . But do n't get me wrong : To come back and do a record was more fun than ever because I 've never felt as strong . I feel like a complete person . It sounds as if having Rene-Charles has had a profound effect on you . It 's like life holds a secret , and having a child is that secret . For me now , deciding which single is going to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first , what I 'm going to wear-it 's all nice , but it is n't as important . You 've talked openly about another fertilized embryo you had frozen when you had the first in vitro . What are your plans for that embryo ? When Rene-Charles was born , Rene and I talked almost immediately about having another baby-after three months my doctor gave me the go-ahead . If I had had an extra six months before having to start my new album , I would have gone for it . But I did n't , and we did n't want to push our luck . So we decided not to rush things . We decided , " Let 's just wait . " Photograph Celine and Rene have 6-month old Rene Charles baptized at a chapel in old Montreal . // So it was a matter of timing ? It was a lot of things . We would have had to go back to New York where her doctor , Zev Rosenwaks , practices infertility medicine , and I would have had to stop breast-feeding Rene-Charles . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to breast-feed the new baby , because I would have been starting the album , then traveling the world . It meant not giving as much to the second child as the first , and I did n't want to do that . This time around , did you feel you had to choose work over getting pregnant again ? Yes . When you sign up for engagements , you have to respect them . I have to be a professional as a mother and I have to be a professional as a singer . As a mother I think I am very professional : I 'm home . That 's all I do . I am with my kid on the floor . I change diapers , 24 hours a day . So you do n't want to fill the house with 14 children , like your mother did ? I 'm a little late for that . But we 'll see if we 're lucky enough to have another or some more . With all these professional obligations , plus a new baby and a husband , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lucky . I can count on my sister Linda , who is Rene-Charles 's godmother . She has a home nearby , and whenever I need her , she 's there . She takes incredibly good care of my son when I 'm working . While I was recording , I was fortunate enough that I could afford to buy another high chair , a bassinet , his toys , and have them in the studio . Coming back home , I gave him a bath and just relaxed . That 's how it is : When I 'm home , I 'm being a mother . When he 's asleep , I 'm being Celine with my husband . And when I 'm doing an interview with you , I 'm being a singer who talks about her songs . And I change diapers . You keep talking about changing diapers . You 're probably the only famous mother who really changes her baby 's diapers . Really ? For me , poop says it all . When you want to know the truth , look to the poop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's constipated , if he 's not getting enough water , if the milk is doing fine . The answer is in the poop . Once Rene-Charles was playing with a vitamin bottle and he ate a little of the paper label off it . You ca n't see everything your child is doing , you make mistakes sometimes ; but thank God that was n't a bad one . I swear to you , the next morning that paper was in his poop . And I thought , " If I do n't watch this kid close enough , one day he 's going to send me a fax in his poop ! " That 's why the mommy has to change the diapers . Rene has three children . Were there any surprising things you learned from him about babies ? His other kids are grown-up . To be honest , it had been so long since his children were babies , I did n't know if he was going to be , I do n't want to say , capable . But when Rene-Charles was born , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I can change the diaper if you want . " I said , " Uh , OK . He 's your baby too . " But I stayed nearby because I want to do everything myself . Laughs So he changed it , and I was pretty impressed : He got it right . You and Rene have a famously romantic relationship . How do you keep the love affair alive now that ReneCharles is in the picture ? Any special tricks ? It 's difficult to have the love affair when you breastfeed . It 's all for your child , not your husband , but it 's all I wanted to do : I wanted milk to come out of my breast and to feed my child . You do n't feel sexy , you do n't feel like putting on your little things , and it 's like , " You ca n't touch this , you ca n't do that . " I wondered , " How am I going to keep the love affair alive and breast-feed at the same time ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give yourself time . Photograph The famously romantic couple strike a typically cozy pose . // A couple of months passed , and it goes so quick , and I found myself saying , " OK , let 's take one night out just for us . " You do n't need to make love and put your best thing on the first time . If you 're not ready to show your breasts , do n't show your breasts . I could n't give myself back to Rene just like that . So was n't that hard for Rene ? Rene was with me so much , he was practically breastfeeding too ! The parents have to live through this together-your husband is the father of the baby ; he 'll understand . If you have to go out just for a walk , just for a hug that lasts an hour , just for French kisses for ten minutes , who cares ? Sometimes you do n't feel like a sexy lover ; so passionate , so hot . That 's normal . Not everyone feels this way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you share any guilty pleasures ? Well , Rene and I share all our fantasies with each other . I ca n't share them with you-I ca n't ! But even the things we 're too shy to say , we try . It 's so-o-o-o exciting . Do you still worry about Rene 's health ? I 'm concerned , but I have to be positive . I ca n't think about it every day . Life is very short and precious . I 'm afraid for my own life , my child 's life , my husband 's life . But it 's like life is a flower and they 're the petals : All I can do is water and feed them and make sure they get sunshine . Which of Rene 's charms do you hope Rene-Charles will inherit ? My husband is very smart . He always wants to figure things out . I think I have good ideas , but when it 's time to organize , I need help . Maybe Rene sometimes does n't think of the details I would , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it . We 've got a special 50/50 relationship . Does Rene-Charles have any of your special talents ? He 's so strong with his voice , his gestures and his eyes , his energy . It 's pretty clear what he wants . He 's also a sensitive kid . When he hears music from commercials or movies , or if Mommy sings a lullaby , he cries . And I was like , " Oh , my gosh , I ca n't even sing to him ! " But my mother told me I was exactly the same way when I was little : Everything that was sensitive , or a romantic ballad , I was crying , like , " Wa-ah , waah , " crying . He 's like that . What do you want him to be when he grows up ? Rene and I are both dark , so when I was pregnant I told everyone in my family , " One thing I know for sure about this baby is , he wo n't be blond and he wo n't have blue eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's got sky-blue eyes . It 's completely amazing . So what do I want ? I want him to be a good human being . Because no matter what you give them , at one point they 'll take their own road and you have to let them become their own selves . Maybe he 'll meet some bad people and go off completely . I just hope he will meet the right people ; and for as long as we can , we will try to be the best parents that we can . This is the most difficult job we 'll ever have . What do you think of all the hot , sexy singers , like Britney Spears , who are so popular right now ? Well , it 's incredible for the eyes . I think that when you 're young and beautiful like that , it 's now or never . Personally , if I start doing that , I 'm going to look completely ridiculous . It does n't mean that I ca n't look sexy and do a song or two in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and having a good time . I 'm 34 , I can do it for a couple more minutes . Laughs But I think I 'd like to go back to the beautiful gowns . I love those gowns with an open slit up the side to the neck , with legs forever . Do you find yourself shopping more for Rene-Charles now than for yourself ? I have n't been shopping for myself in a long time , to be honest . As for Rene-Charles , I have n't had to buy one toy yet ; he is very spoiled by family and friends . But his clothes-this I love to buy for him very much . Did Rene give you any surprising little gifts when Rene-Charles was born ? He gave me a beautiful necklace , but Rene never waits for an occasion . Every month or two he writes me something or gives me a surprise . Sometimes he 's trying so hard , he does too much . He 's so happy , he does n't know what to do , and I have to say , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're happy . Me too , OK ? Take it easy . " <p>
