Chapter One NEW YORK CITY , MARCH 17 , 1930 This one , they say , will stand forever . Michael Briody digs his bootheel into the muck and listens as hotshots in crisp dark suits speak of marvels . All around , in the gaping desolation where the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel so recently stood , are tangles of cables , beams , uncoiled air hoses , heavy trucks , and stacks of muddy lumber . The speakers huddle on a slapped-together podium and take turns salting the morning air with superlatives : grand , gigantic , epic , magnificent , unrivaled , biggest , best , momentous . They trace imaginary arcs in the air and all agree . The Empire State Building will dominate the Manhattan skyline , dwarfing all pretenders to the crown of tallest structure in the world . Briody looks about at the gangs of his fellow workmen , who he knows ca n't wait till this is over . Next to him Armstrong lifts his shoulders and bounces on the balls of his feet . " Christ , " he mutters . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seconds on a work gang would put any one of them in a hospital ward . " Armstrong lets you know he started as a rivet punk on the Woolworth Building back in ' 13 , that he has banged up steel on more skyscrapers than he can count . " Who needs these dipshits ? " he asks . " I seen this city change shape beneath my feet . I'mthe goddamn rivet king of New York . " On the sidewalks surrounding the excavation gawkers pause . They crowd five and six deep , jostling for views through holes cut in the wooden fence . Others mass around the entrances of ramps that lead down into the site . Some gather hoping for work , thinking , Hey , why not me . Men rise on their toes , angling for clear sight lines . Children perch atop parents . The air has the tinge of carnival , a funfair . Opportunists in shiny suits work the crowd selling postcards and trinkets commemorating the event , shouting about the eighth wonder of the world . Cameras still and moving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Broadway prince , each hair exact , steps to the microphone . He looks over the assembled , smiles widely , and starts to speak but is interrupted by an unholy screech of feedback that careens off the foundation 's stone walls and assaults the gathered , causing them to slap hands to ears , wince . Walker , an old pro in a new medium , rides out the noise , and when it subsides says , " I did n't realize Fiorello was here too . " The crowd roars . There is n't a goo-goo vote for blocks . Walker smiles again . It 's the kind of smile that lights up rooms , douses ire , and lets him get away with so much . Walker knows the drill . He pays homage to the project , its scale , and to those making it happen . He steps back in line , his head fuzzy from way too much champagne the night before . He swoons toward reminiscence . Back before he entered politics he was a Tin Pan Alley sport , a writer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sawbuck to Chuckles Larue , the house dick , and frolicked away an afternoon in the grand hotel with a chorine . Those were the days . Now it is no more . The papers told all about it , how the destruction sparked a million memories , all those echoes of lost celebrations . People called asking for keys to rooms in which they had honeymooned . A socialite in Denver called demanding a ballroom mirror , a length of bar was hauled down to a speakeasy in the Village , chandeliers were hustled to uptown drawing rooms . Then the demolition gangs swung their wrecking balls and hammers and knocked the grand hotel into a pile of junk that was carted away and dumped into the briny sea just off of Sandy Hook . Like the corpse of some refugee nobody cared to claim . Briody is not surprised that none of the swells on stage mention the six men who died demolishing the old hotel . Not surprised in the least . He considers their ugly endings , the crushed and broken bodies spirited away like just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ untold . He shifts his weight from foot to foot , is anxious to start work . His fellow workers watch with dull stares . They have no interest in the staged spectacle . They mutter and joke under their breath until one of the concrete crew makes a loud noise , like a ripe fart , and the superintendent swivels his fat head around and glares at them as if they were recalcitrant schoolboys . They fall silent . They want the work . The next stop is the breadline . Al Smith , red-faced and stout , strides to center stage as a round of applause rises against the swirl of the wind . He rolls his cigar over his teeth , tosses it aside , doffs his brown derby . He wraps a meaty hand around the neck of the microphone and cracks a wide smile that flashes gold . He sweeps a hand across his front , indicating the foundation . " I know it do n't look like much today . But trust me . The same way I came out of the Fulton Fish Market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too will this site be transformed . A year from now we 'll be drinking tea a quarter mile high in the air and looking down on Walter Chrysler 's nifty little tower . " Smith accepts the shouts and cheers of the crowd and talks about the project , its magnitude , its importance , as if he were still trying to convince himself that the raising of a skyscraper is a serious enough task for a man who so recently was his party 's candidate for president of the United States of America . He eases the gathered into a few awkward verses of his theme song : " East Side , Wrest Side-we tripped the light fantastic on the sidewalks of New York . " Briody knows the story-how Alfred E. Smith came up from the docks of the Lower East Side , how he clawed his way to the top , made governor , how he looks out for his own kind . And while he no longer occupies the office , he holds the title still . They say he champions the little man , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest , his tight shave , his diamond stickpin catching the morning sun , he is a long way from the reek and stifle of the cargo hold . There is to be a ritual first rivet and Briody , with his tall Celtic features , has been told by the superintendent that he is the ironworkers ' poster boy , like it or not . Dust rises in little swirls as the wind blows through the site . The dignitaries vie for position in the throw of the camera 's strobe while out on Thirty-fourth Street someone leans hard on a car horn . A hush flails over the crowd . The sky is clear . Briody comes forward and smiles stiffly . His colleagues have a hoot at his expense , but he does n't mind . He looks up and sees the office workers crowded at their windows , staring slack-jawed , heads resting on shoulders , women peeking through men 's elbows , noting the event so as to pass it down to the generations to come . The Governor , his crooked smile wide , shakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the bricklayers union . " Briody feels the warm fleshiness of his palm and says , " Ah , that 's grand , Governor . A brickie . " He imagines that the last billion bricks or so in the city , have been laid without the man 's help . Skinny Sheehan cranks the bellows , flaring his coke fire . The rivets are bright orange now and Sheehan spits gently into the heat , his saliva hissing into steam . He nods and Armstrong plucks a rivet out of the heater . Acrid smoke stings the air . The officials push forward , moths to a light of recognition . It is not enough to merely be present . They must be seen to have been there , their attendance entered into the official record that is the city 's tabloids . Their movement kicks up more dust , causing a few to produce handkerchiefs and blow the muck out of their noses . Briody hooks the pneumatic hose to his rivet gun , securing it with a quick turn of the wrist . The column is held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go-ahead , waves the crowd silent as if this is a moment for reverence . Armstrong puts the scalding steel nugget in place , Delpezzo bucks it up , and Briody drives it home , securing the column to an anchor plate . The tool barks like a Thompson as a golden flame erupts around the rivet and sparks shoot in dying arcs from each side of the steel . A roar goes up from the men of commerce . There is fear in these men now , maybe for the first time ever , so they need this day , want the energy and optimism that the construction of this behemoth will take-want it all to rub off on them . The politicos make a point of glad-handing the union officials who showed up . Every vote counts . The Mayor backslaps the boys : the ironworkers , the laborers , the derrick men . He puts his arm around the son of a man he knows from his old Greenwich Village neighborhood . But as soon as the cameras are put away the crowd disperses until it is just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hard Nose McCabe , strides toward them . At six feet five inches he towers over most of the men and he can barely contain his disgust over the work delay caused by the ceremony . " All right ladies , now that your mothers are gone it 's time to get this modern marvel built , " he shouts over the carpenters pounding apart the podium . Briody leans back until his head is parallel to the ground . He stares up into the vast blue expanse of the New York sky and tries to project how far the steel they are about to throw up will reach . To what point in the heavens he and his crew will ascend , where they will meet the ether , where the Stars and Stripes will be mounted at the topping-off ceremony . There is nothing in sight to scale it by . " Great country , hey Paddy ? " Armstrong slaps his back . His head is heavy with blood so he rights himself . For once , he does n't even mind being called Paddy . He nods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nothing gets built in Gotham without a kickback . When the Empire State developers were ready to turn their crazy dream into concrete and steel they had turned to Johnny Farrell . Now Farrel stood in the foundation hole admiring the scope of the project he had helped make possible . He pulled his fedora snug and stepped lightly across the dirty construction site . Up on Thirty-fourth Street he slid into the backseat of the Mayor 's jade green Duesenberg , where Walker was busy wiping his shoes with a handkerchief . They rode in silence through scattershot city traffic , skirted trolleys , horses , jalopies , and trucks , the dashing and darting populace . The driver worked his horn and siren to little effect . " Did you see Smith ? In his glory with the finance men , his new pals . He 's a long way from his boyhood on Oliver Street , our old friend . Next thing , he 'll be breaking bread with Episcopalians , or joining the Union Club , maybe running for redemption on the Republican ticket . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . " Do me a favor , Johnny Farrell , when I am out of the politicking business , do n't let me sully myself so . " " I 'll make a point of it , your honor . " " And he gives me grief for enjoying the nightlife , the odd showgirl . " " It 's easy to be self-righteous with a full belly . " " Is it ? " The Mayor placed his homburg on the seat between them , leaving his hand atop it . Farrell noticed the thinness of his fingers , the nails immaculately buffed , the skin pale and smooth . If ever a man was born to a particular job in a particular place and time it was Jimmy Walker , Mayor of New York . Farrell wondered how the Mayor saw his career . Was this his last stop ? He clearly loved his position , reveled in the power , the pomp , the burn of the spotlight , and while he never expressed interest beyond his present office , who knew ? Walker lived his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . Farrell 's success often depended on his ability to read the Mayor , to anticipate his moods and whims , but it was never easy . Walker stared out the window and said , " So , Deputy Commissioner of Buildings , did the little code changes make my constituents happy ? " " Pleased as punch . " Farrell smiled at the rare use of his official government title . " A small price to pay for the ability to construct such a monument to their own greed . " " Business as usual . " " Well , it should keep the lads happy in this time of need . " Farrell broke down the kickback in his head , distributing the loot , working his mental abacus . The Mayor , as usual , would take far less than he deserved . In these matters he was strangely reserved . A small percentage , a " commission " he called it , a fee for his services . Which Farrell was entrusted to deposit in one of the fourteen bank accounts the Mayor had going , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sherwood Wilson , who would squirrel it away God knows where . There was a lot of talk of overseas accounts and blind trusts . Walker tended to keep his distance from graft . Still , he knew better than to try to stop it . The system had acquired a dangerous momentum and woe to the man who interfered with its dark commerce . Farrell had no qualms about taking his share , and occasionally bits and pieces of others ' . And why not ? They ran the show and to the victor go the spoils . Johnny Farrell popped a mint into his mouth , adjusted his cuffs , and wriggled deeper into his seat . Even so , this was by far the biggest score he had ever worked on . The developers needed two changes in the building code to make the Empire State Building feasible , never mind profitable . Steel gauge and elevator speed . Two simple adjustments in the way skyscrapers were built that the Mayor had vetoed twice without comment . Farrell had played the developers beautifully , had created supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had led to the massing of capital and the forging of steel in the burning cauldrons of the Monongahela River Valley , to the commitment of the money boys , to the transformation of an idea into a million tons of fact . And Farrell had secured the Mayor 's signature , after doubling its price , of course , to a nice round one million dollars . And that was just the beginning . There were to be dozens of subcontractors on the job who would have to pay for the privilege , not to mention ancillary work like sewer lines , roads , and a sparkling new subway station . Plus , someone had to meet the gambling and policy needs of several thousand workers . Farrell controlled all of it . " It 's just a bigger scale than usual . Any contractor knows how this town works . " " I am sure you educate those who do n't . " " The reformers ca n't fault us on this one . Even when the Organization is out of power , nothing gets built without a tribute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world calls for the biggest payoff . " Farrell knew he did not need to spell it out for Walker . Kickbacks were as constant as the roar of the elevated . Whether the government was machine or reform , Democrat or Republican , made no great difference . Continues ...
