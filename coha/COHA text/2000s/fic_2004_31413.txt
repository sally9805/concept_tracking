Recently , whenever I talk in my sleep  --  which has been quite often lately  --  I speak English . It 's odd , since I 've only spoken the language occasionally in half a century . But just last week , I woke Henri with some nocturnal gibberish . He roused me and repeated my mumblings as best he could , and I realized I was singing a few lines from " Oft in the Stilly Night , " an old song Grandmre 's servant Alzea had taught me before we fled Parlange , our sugar plantation in Louisiana . Fully awake , I can still recall a verse : Oft in the stilly night , Ere slumber 's chain hath bound me , Fond memory brings the light Of other days around me , The smiles , the tears , of girlhood 's years , The words of love then spoken , The eyes that shone , now dimmed and gone , The cheerful hearts now broken ! Thus , in the stilly night , Ere slumber 's chain hath bound me , Sad memory brings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is right . There really is an " unconscious " mind . Perhaps mine lives in the Old South . I 'd been dreaming of Tante Julie 's wedding day , of watching her glide across the wide gallery at Parlange , her pale face streaked with sweat , the pink rosebuds braided through her hair turning limp and brown in the steaming heat . She was dressed in heavy cream satin  --  an old ball gown that Grandmre had dug out of a trunk the day before . Alzea had stayed up all night altering the sleeves and neckline , and I had sat beside her in the flickering candlelight of the kitchenhouse , sobbing like a baby . I did not want Tante Julie to marry . Her fiance , Lieutenant Lucas Rochilieu , was a short , fat toad of a man , with an ugly mole on the tip of his nose and a bloody patch over one eye from a wound he had received when he accidentally shot himself while cleaning his gun four months earlier . But I would have hated him even if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Julie , the person I loved most in the world  --  more than my baby sister Valentine , more than Mama and Papa , I 'm ashamed to say . It was August 1861 , the first summer of the war . I was six . Papa , a lawyer in New Orleans , had left to fight with the mostly Creole Louisiana Regiment , and Mama , Valentine , and I had joined Grandmre at Parlange , thirty-five miles west of New Orleans on False River . Though the adults had strictly forbidden it , I slipped off to the fields after breakfast to cut myself an armload of sugarcane . For an hour , I sat on the front lawn in the gray shade of a magnolia , peeling and eating the sweet stalks as carriages rolled up the alley of oaks . A few guests had already gathered in the parlor , and I could see them through the tall French windows talking and sipping drinks under dark portraits of my ancestors . Most of Grandmre 's slaves had run off , and there was no time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hauled the last crates of wine and champagne up from the cellar . Mama and I fashioned bouquets from the few garden flowers that had n't shriveled in the scalding sun , and we arranged them in vases in the parlor . The air was heavy with smoke . Some of the neighbors had taken to burning their cotton to keep it out of enemy hands , and my head began to ache from the foul air and the heat . I decided to go to the gallery to cool off and talk to Julie . The gallery was my favorite place at Parlange . The wide porch surrounded the entire green-shuttered house and provided enough space to accommodate a small orchestra and twenty dancing couples on Saturday evenings . The back portion looked out on the colorful garden and beyond , to endless fields of waving cane . At night , the twanging notes of banjos wafted through the treetops from the Negro quarters , which were screened by a tall fence . The front gallery held a collection of wicker tables and chairs . Julie and I spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in our family , Julie was small and narrow-waisted . Her straight black hair hung like curtains from a center part and framed a gentle , oval face . At twenty-eight , she was two years younger than Mama , though she seemed closer to my age . It was n't only her uncoiffed hair . There was something childlike about her flat chest and stick arms . She had a lovely singing voice , and she painted beautifully , in a distinctive style marked by insightful realism . Years later , many artists would ask me  --  beg me  --  to pose for them . But Julie was the first to notice my potential . " Mimi , you have exquisite lines , and your hair ! I 've never seen such a glorious copper color , like the kitchenhouse kettles , " she told me . She did many studies of me  --  asleep on the brocade settee in the parlor , bathing in front of the fireplace in my room , on the swing in the garden  --  but she refused to display these pictures or any others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , unsigned , and she scrawled on the back , " Not to be shown to anyone . " Julie grew up at Parlange and never left . She was content with her quiet life and once told me she had no desire to marry , the chief point of a Creole woman 's existence . " Men are bothersome beings . I do n't want to spend my days worrying about one , " she said . " But do n't you want babies ? " I asked . " Cherie , if I ever had a child , I 'd want it to be exactly like you . In fact , I 'd want it to come into the world exactly like you , a spirited little red-haired girl who reads and converses  --  and not a naked , screaming infant . " I do n't remember any beaux calling on Julie . So I was surprised one evening when a portly Rebel soldier ambled up the alley of oaks , then mounted the steps . " Is Miss de Ternant , Miss Julie de Ternant , receiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had taken the steamboat from New Orleans and he smelled of the cigars and brandy he had enjoyed on the trip . That evening , I saw him sitting in the parlor with Grandmre and Julie . My aunt was perched stiffly on an armless " lady 's " chair with billowing skirts draped around her , while Rochilieu and Grandmre talked on and on . The next morning , Grandmre announced that the marriage would take place in two days . Now , as I approached the house , I saw that Julie was reciting her Rosary . She paced back and forth on the cypress floor of the second-floor gallery , twice stopping to lean against the railing , fifteen feet above the ground . She gazed off in the distance , over my head , as if expecting to see some far-off sail on False River . I 'm certain she never noticed me . Suddenly she dropped her amber beads on the floor . Holding fistfuls of cream satin at her hips , she grabbed a white pillar and hoisted herself atop the railing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's caryatid , her eyes closed and her chin to the sky . I thought she had resigned herself to her marriage , and this was her way of saying good-bye to maidenhood . But suddenly she let go of the pillar and slowly tumbled forward , swanning , then flipping once in the air , her dress ballooning out above her knees . By the time I jerked forward , instinctively moving to catch her with my childish arms , she had hit the ground with a dull thud . A group of chattering adults rounding the corner of the house from the garden gasped to see the pile of satin on the lawn . Grandmre , her coffee-dyed brown hair tucked under a straw hat , ran to Julie , knocking over a butler 's tray holding brown-sugar lemonade and a cornmeal pound cake . Others followed , hovering , crying . Someone called for Dr. Porter . The priest approached , but Grandmre pushed him away with her wiry arms . " Keep back ! " she cried . I stood frozen on the lawn , until a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " It was Charles , Julie and Mama 's half brother . His eyes were red and filling with tears . Clasping my hand tightly , Charles led me past the murmuring circle of dark figures and up a back staircase to his room in the garonnire . He removed a checkerboard and a box of checkers from a mahogany bookcase and arranged a game on a wicker table . " Let 's play , " he said . Charles was a large boy , with a big head and a smooth , intelligent face . His blue eyes were fringed with curly black lashes the color of his straight hair  --  Julie 's hair  --  and his mouth was a red bow . All his clothes came from Paris , and though I 'm sure at times he wore homespun flannel like the other planters ' sons , I recall him only in fancy breeches , broadcloth waistcoats , and stiff white linen collars . He was just six years older than I , but he had a sure sense of self and a serious manner that made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . With a shaky index finger , I pushed a black checker forward . Charles responded with a red . For five minutes , we stared at the board and moved checkers silently . Finally I found the strength to ask , " Do you think Tante Julie is dead ? " " Probably , " said Charles . He was trying to act manly , to speak flatly and show no emotion . But his voice came out in gulps . " The heat must have made her crazy . It 's always horrible on the feast of Sainte Claire . " Charles was obsessed with the weather . He watched every change and spent hours studying the sky and the clouds . Several times a day , he consulted his Almanach franais  --  the American Almanac was worthless , he said  --  which gave the saints ' feast days and , he insisted , provided clues to weather patterns . " Then we 'll see her in heaven , " I said hopefully . I knew from The Gates Ajar , an American book Papa read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open to welcome new arrivals . When I died , I would be reunited there with my lost loved ones . We would be happy angels , an unbroken circle of love , the book said , free from all trouble and harm . Charles slid a red checker forward with two square fingers . " If only Julie had waited a few days , cooler weather would have come with the Feast of Chantal , and then she would have felt better , " he said . I placed my finger on a fat black checker , but this time I could n't move it . The thought of waiting until my own death to see Julie  --  impossibly distant , I assumed  --  had stolen my resolve . " Mimi , go on ! " snapped Charles , fighting for his equilibrium . My tears erupted in a single burst . I ran from the room , down to the end of the hallway , and hid in the large linen closet , intoxicating myself with the cool , soft linen sheets and the deep , sharp fragrance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and she had willed it to survive . Even today , more than fifty years later , though it still stands and she is long gone , no one who lived through those times can think of the plantation without conjuring an image of her . Grandmre 's parents were Canadian immigrants who died in one of the many yellow-fever epidemics that raged through Louisiana with the summer heat . She was adopted by the plantation 's original owner , Marquis Vincent de Ternant III , the descendant of a French nobleman , and his childless wife . Soon the wife died , and a few months later de Ternant married Grandmre . She was barely fourteen . She quickly had four children  --  Mama was the first . But Grandmre was an indifferent mother and thought nothing of leaving her babies behind to go off to Paris for the social season . People still talk about the stir she caused boarding steamers in New Orleans , corseted nearly to suffocation in a brocaded gown and trailed by ten slaves dressed like African royalty in silk turbans and robes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , rue Miromesnil and went to theaters and the opera , where her box was next to the box of Charles Parlange , one of Napoleon 's colonels . After the marquis dropped dead of a heart attack one evening in the middle of dinner , his head falling into a plate of oysters , Grandmre married Colonel Parlange and brought him to Louisiana . She renamed the plantation in his honor . The colonel did n't last long in the choking Louisiana heat . He died two years after the wedding , leaving Grandmre with another baby , Charles . After losing two husbands , Grandmre set out to run the plantation herself . During the next year , though two of her middle children  --  a boy and a girl  --  died , she did n't let grief stop her from learning everything there was to know : she pored over the plantation 's ledgers and diaries at night , studied weather patterns , repaired the levees and irrigation canals , and organized the army of slaves for the fall harvest . Grandmre considered herself French , but when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the marrow of her bones . She did not believe slavery was evil , even though it had been outlawed in France . She thought Negroes were ignorant savages incapable of living on their own , and she took pleasure in the failures of those who had run away from Parlange or managed to buy their freedom . She drove her slaves hard , though she was not gratuitously cruel . She would n't have dreamed of selling a mother away from her children , as some planters did , and she reserved beatings for serious offenses like stealing . She rewarded industry and once sent a slave who showed a talent for carpentry to New Orleans to apprentice with a famous ebeniste . He returned to make Grandmre 's massive , intricately carved bed and most of the armoires in the house . Grandmre took care of her slaves when they were sick , fed and clothed them well , and gave them Saturday nights and Sundays off . Grandmre and Mama were only fifteen years apart . They looked like sisters , both small and wiry , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair . By the time I came along , Grandmre 's hair had turned a dull , muddy brown , the result of rinsing it once a week in coffee , and there was a hardness around her mouth and eyes , as if her determination had finally etched itself on her face . Mama and Julie were raised at Parlange and took lessons from a French tutor . They did n't learn to speak English until they were adolescents , and they never learned to read or write it well . Of the sisters , Mama was the more robust , but Julie was the one who enjoyed roaming the fields and playing with the dogs that were always lounging on the grounds . Mama disdained the slow , uneventful pace of plantation life . " Even as a child I was bored by it , " she confessed to me once . " I was born sophisticated . " During frequent trips into New Orleans with Grandmre and Julie , Mama walked on the narrow banquettes of the French Quarter , past the rows of old houses with their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the expensive trinkets behind the glass storefronts , and the elegant couples she glimpsed through carriage windows and hotel doorways . When Mama was eighteen and Julie sixteen , Grandmre bought a house on Burgundy Street , a headquarters from which she launched her daughters into Creole society . She hosted teas and dinners and took the girls to the opera , where they sat sipping champagne in a loge lined with red velvet . Julie was indifferent to the social hurly-burly and often declined invitations to parties . But Mama never missed one . At a dance at the St. Louis Hotel , she met Papa . She said they fell in love the moment their eyes locked across the ballroom . The orchestra was playing a waltz , and candlelight from two enormous crystal chandeliers flickered over the twirling couples . Papa was perhaps the most eligible bachelor in town  --  tall and handsome , with flashing dark eyes and auburn hair that rippled from his forehead in glossy ridges . He was also brilliant , having studied the law and set up a practice on Camp Street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father , Philippe Avegno , had arrived in New Orleans from Italy in 1823 , already wealthy from his Italian shipbuilding operation . After marrying the daughter of one of the city 's most prominent Creole families , he amassed a new fortune in real estate and built a high-ceilinged mansion on Toulouse Street . The couple had ten children ; Papa was the seventh . He married Mama two months after they met , and took her to live in his father 's house . " I felt like I was home for the first time in my life , " Mama told me later . It 's hard to imagine what Papa saw in Mama , beyond her beauty . She was gorgeous  --  with large black eyes , flawless white skin , and a slender , graceful figure . But she was prickly and prone to imagining disasters . She also was a relentless complainer , always snapping and picking at Papa . Frequently , he lost his temper with her . I 'd often awake in the morning to their loud , violent shouting . I remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' bedroom , the slammed doors , and my mother 's pathetic crying when the storm was over . Decades later , long after my parents ' death , I was astounded to find a copy of divorce papers in Mama 's desk . A few months after Valentine was born , she 'd sought to end her marriage  --  an almost unthinkable act for a Catholic Creole . According to the court papers , during one of their arguments , Papa had socked Mama in the eye , drawing blood , and Mama had fled her father-in-law 's home , taking Valentine and me to live in Grandmre 's townhouse on Burgundy Street . I vaguely recall moving there after Christmas one year , but I have no recollection of Papa not joining us . In fact , I have a distinct memory of him playing with me on the parlor carpet . He always was gentle and affectionate with his children . I do n't believe he ever once spanked me . Before anything could come of the divorce , the war broke out , and Papa left to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so Mama agreed to join her . But she did n't fit easily into the role of adult daughter living in her childhood home . Mama took no interest in helping Grandmre run the plantation , and she spent most of her time sitting on the back gallery , rocking Valentine 's cradle with her foot and complaining loudly about the dearth of " congenial people " to call on or to pay calls on us . She had more grievances : the mosquitoes , the killing heat , the paucity of servants to help with the children . Then Rochilieu arrived . With the excitement of the wedding , Mama perked up and helped eagerly with preparations , selecting the china and crystal to be used during the reception and dressing Julie 's hair a few hours before the nuptials . I did n't understand why Mama was so happy about marrying Julie off to a fat , ugly old soldier . " Julie does n't even like him ! " I pointed out to Mama as I helped her collect plates from the cupboard in the dining room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me sternly and said , " In the name of our family Julie must make a good match . " As it turned out , Julie did not die . She survived , though in very bad shape , with two broken legs , several cracked ribs , and a severely strained back . Each morning , Alzea picked her up and carried her from her bed to the parlor settee or to a wicker chaise on the front gallery , where Grandmre gave her the responsibility to watch for Yankee soldiers . At night , Alzea carried Julie back to bed . One day , one of the Negroes staked a pole with a white towel tacked to it on the road near our front gate , a signal to old Dr. Porter to come up to the house when he passed on his daily rounds . He fitted Julie with an elaborate steel brace that she wore under her clothes . The awful contraption chafed her skin , causing terrible sores that had to be washed twice a day . I spent hours by her side , holding old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could read it to me . Julie never complained about her infirmity , and seemed as cheerful and playful as ever . She composed a little English verse , which she recited to me every day : A six-year-old child , A six-year-old child Is a wonderful thing to behold . I love you , Mimi , My six-year-old child . Please never , ever grow old ! There was no more talk of marrying her off to Lucas Rochilieu , who had left grumpily the day after the aborted wedding . Forever afterward , Grandmre and Mama spoke of Julie 's leap from the gallery only as " a terrible accident . " One day , Mama took me aside . " You must never say a word to anyone about Tante Julie 's accident , " she warned . " And you must never , ever ask Tante Julie about it . " Of course , I had already asked Julie why she did it . She looked at me ruefully and sighed . " Someday you 'll understand , Mimi , " she said . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirits stayed high , to the rest of the household her suicide attempt seemed a gloomy presage of future disaster . Even as a child , I knew that trouble was coming , that life was changing . Though the war had n't yet stretched beyond New Orleans , Grandmre believed it was only a matter of time before Yankee soldiers marched through Parlange . Alzea made a French flag out of some old dresses and hung it from a cypress post on the front gallery as a signal of our neutrality . Still , Grandmre buried four metal chests full of cash in the garden and hid her best jewels in the hollow of an ornately carved bedpost . And she started carrying a large dagger in her belt . Our tutor , a young man who lived in one of the pigeonniers on the front lawn , had enlisted in the Confederate Army when the war started , and no one bothered anymore with our lessons . Charles and I were left on our own most of the day to roam the woods and meadows . Sometimes we 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fields and watch the workers , their backs bent against the sun as they sliced cane knives through the tall reeds . We 'd go to the garden for picnics of peaches and smoked ham prepared by Alzea . Afterward we 'd try to catch frogs in the stream by the side of the house . Or we 'd spend hours playing with our pets at the barn . I had two chickens , which I had named Sanspareil and Papillon . Charles 's pet was a brown bear cub he called Rossignol , who was chained to a thick post outside the barn . A slave had killed Rossignol 's mother with a scythe after she wandered into the fields one day . Another Negro caught the cub and gave him to Charles . The most tempting diversion of all , particularly on brutally hot days , was to sneak off to False River , a narrow ribbon-shaped lake that had formed from a bend in the vast Mississippi centuries ago . Mama had forbidden us to go near the water , even though we were good swimmers . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one day , when I was light-headed from the heat , I suggested to Charles that we go for a swim . Charles studied the sky , sniffed the air , and said , " There 's no need to swim . I 'm sure it 's going to rain . Mama 's corns were killing her this morning . " " If you wo n't go , I 'll go by myself . You just do n't want to swim because you know I 'm a better swimmer than you . " " Mimi , you 're a deluded child , " he said in the formal , supercilious manner he used with everyone . " But if you want to be humiliated in a race , fine . " We ran down the straight driveway , across the main road , and up the bank to False River . " We 'll see who 's faster , " I said . I pointed out a starting point near a large oak and indicated a spot about fifty yards down the bank as the finish line . We stripped down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and swam as fast as we could , furiously churning our arms . Out of the corner of my eye , I saw a female figure striding toward us . Her stiff broadcloth skirt swung like a bell , and the wide ribbons of her bonnet flapped around her shoulders . At first I thought it was Mama , but as the figure drew closer I heard Grandmre 's scratchy bark and saw the glistening dagger in her belt . Charles had seen her , too , and now we stood in the muddy water up to our waists , shivering from fear under the burning white sky . " Get out right now and put your clothes on ! " Grandmre shouted . We scrambled into our things , and Grandmre pushed us up the levee , a bony , blue-veined hand on each of our backs . When we got to the house , she took one of the long , thin keys that hung from a large ring on her belt and unlocked a door under the front stairwell . " Get in , " she ordered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door shut and turned the key . The square enclosure was just big enough for the two of us . It smelled of damp wood . A shaft of sunlight slid under the door , providing enough light for us to see clusters of spiders and bugs . " Mimi , you 're always getting us in trouble , " hissed Charles . " And you 're so perfect , " I snapped . For the next twenty minutes , we bickered and poked and nudged each other . Just when I thought I could n't stand another second of it , I heard a rapping on the ceiling , followed by a loud plink . In the slice of sunlight at the door , I saw a key on the ground . Grandmre had left it on the table next to Julie 's chaise , and Julie had pushed it off the gallery . By lying flat on my stomach , I could stretch my hand under the door and finger the cool metal key . Another scraping push , and I had it . As Charles and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we heard Julie chirping above . " You 're free , cheris ! Free , free . " Our swimming adventure had put Grandmre in a particularly foul mood , and for the next week or so Charles and I stayed close to the house . One afternoon , we made a book for Julie , from a serialized novel in yellowed copies of L'Abeille , the Creole newspaper . We were cutting out the pages and sewing them together when a pale boy tore up to the house on horseback . He tied his mare to a cypress post and stomped up the steps . I went with Mama to answer the bell . The boy said nothing , but he handed her a white sheet of paper bordered in black . I could n't read the words , but I saw the drawing of a tombstone and a weeping willow , and I knew immediately what it meant . Papa was dead . Mama read the note with frightened eyes , then crushed the paper in her fist and fell to her knees . We both sobbed loudly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , because of it , Mama was devastated . Grandmre , who was in the dining room helping Alzea set the table for lunch , heard us and ran in . " Papa ! My papa is dead ! " I cried . Grandmre crossed herself and knelt down to pray . I ran out of the house and down the steps and the alley of oaks . I ran and ran  --  so hard that my lungs swallowed my sobs  --  along the banks of False River . It was a gray day , unusually cool for April , and the yellow anemones shivered along the river 's edge . Eventually I came upon two farm boys fishing . Their bright blue calico shirts were the same color as their eyes , and they were dangling their feet in the sluggish water . " My papa is dead ! " I cried and dropped to my knees , sobbing . One of the boys laid down his fishing rod and rushed to my side . " There , there , little girl , " he said , patting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My father is dead , too . " I later learned that Papa had been shot in the left leg on the second day of the Battle at Shiloh , and was put on a train bound for New Orleans . En route , his condition worsened and he was taken off at Camp Moore in Amite , Louisiana , where his leg was amputated above the knee . An hour later , he died . That afternoon , Mama , Grandmre , Charles , Valentine , and I took the steamer for New Orleans . Julie stayed behind with Alzea . We arrived at Grandmre 's house on Burgundy Street in late evening . Papa 's coffin was in the high-ceilinged parlor , surrounded by dripping candles and white chrysanthemums . A prie-dieu stood before the casket . A line of mourners , some of them Papa 's clients from his Camp Street law practice , surrounded the casket . When Mama and I entered , everyone dropped back to make room . Papa looked like he was asleep , his freckled white hands crossed over his chest and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ empty pant leg . Mama and I had been dry-eyed on the steamer , but now we both wailed uncontrollably . Grandmre pulled a nail scissors from her purse and clipped a tuft of Papa 's hair , which she later had made into a bracelet for Mama . I 've tried all these years not to remember Papa as a corpse , to recall him as he looked when I saw him last . He was dressed in the uniform of the Louisiana Zouaves  --  brilliant red cap , dark-blue serge jacket with gold braid on the sleeves , and baggy silk trousers . Tears spilled from his eyes as he bent to kiss me on the New Orleans wharf before he marched up a gangplank and disappeared into a large transport ship with a thousand other soldiers . As the vessel pulled out , hundreds of handkerchiefs waved from the shore , and the violent shriek of the steam whistle drowned the shouts and cries of the loved ones left behind . Mama and I held hands on the long carriage ride to St. Louis Cemetery , where Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parents . For days afterward , Mama stayed up all night , pacing the galleries  --  I could hear her muffled sobs through the walls . In the morning , she had purple circles under her eyes and walked around like a ghost , clutching a torn linen handkerchief . The next month passed in a blur of humid , rainy days . Grandmre convinced Mama she 'd feel better if she got busy , so Mama began tending to Valentine and even helping Alzea a bit with the housework  --  something I had never seen her do before . Charles spent much of his time walking through the house , looking out the windows and watching the sky for climatic changes . Julie and I read and reread every book in the library . Sometimes neighbors called , sitting in the parlor on chairs pushed against the walls . Alzea would distribute palmetto fans , and people would fan themselves and chat over red wine and cornmeal cake . Meanwhile , Grandmre worked nonstop . Though the war had caused land values to plummet , and the blockaded ports meant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep Parlange going . She was up every morning before dawn and pacing the back gallery and reciting her Rosary , her thick heels clomping on the cypress floors . Sometimes she 'd stop and curse loudly at one of the slaves who had stayed on the plantation ; then she 'd clasp her beads and start pacing again . Afterward she 'd pin her skirt up to her knees , don a pair of men 's cowhide boots , and tromp out to the fields to supervise the workers . In the evening , she balanced the ledgers by candlelight in her " office , " a corner of the back gallery where she had set up an old table as her desk . She hired laborers  --  poor bedraggled white men  --  to replace the slaves who had left , and every Saturday morning they came to collect their wages . Grandmre would arrange several whiskey bottles and glasses on the table , and as each man approached , she would pour him a drink and place a few coins in his outstretched hand .

Nothing infuriated her more than hearing a member of her household speak English . She had banned all use of " les mots Yanquis " at Parlange . In Grandmre 's view , English was " la langue des voleurs , " the language of thieves , because all the words were stolen from other languages , chiefly , of course , from French . She claimed that the few times she was forced to speak English she almost dislocated her jaw , which you 'd understand if you heard her pronounce , say , " biscuit " or " potato . " In Grandmre 's mouth , they sounded like " bee-skeet " and " pah-taht .

She looked so sad it broke my heart . I wanted to cheer her up , so I blurted out a fragment of an English verse : Rats , they killed the dogs and chased the cats , And ate the cheese right out of the vats . Mama 's playing halted , and I heard Julie laugh softly behind her shawl . Grandmre stared at me with bright blue eyes . She rose slowly from her chair , walked up to me , and slapped me across the face . I ran to my room and stayed there for the rest of the evening . I dreaded facing Grandmre the next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was obvious she had more important matters on her mind . Julie 's former fiance , Lucas Rochilieu , was sitting at the table , dressed in frayed , grubby grays . He had grown desperately thin in the eight months since I had seen him last , and his brown hair hung over his collar in scraggly grayish strands . He had fought at the Battle of Shiloh with Papa , I later learned , and then gone to Vera Cruz , Mexico , on orders from President Jefferson Davis , to buy guns . He was to rejoin his regiment in Richmond , but instead he deserted , bolting for Louisiana , traveling mostly by horseback through back roads and swamps . It took him two weeks to reach his plantation in Plaquemine , where he collected some money and valuables . Now he was on his way to the Gulf of Mexico . He hoped to flag down a foreign ship to take him to France . But he had heard that Yankee troops were in the area and decided to stop off at Parlange to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for sure if you stay , " he said heavily . " You do n't know the danger ! The Yankees have been shooting women and children in their beds . " Rochilieu opened his square linen napkin and draped it dramatically across his lap . He tucked into the plate of beignets Alzea had placed in front of him . His mustache moved up and down as he chewed , and I considered the large mole on his nose . If Julie had n't thrown herself over the gallery , she 'd probably have to kiss that mole every day , I thought with a shudder . From the opposite side of the table , Mama listened intently , with her long-fingered hands folded on the table . Her engagement ring , a diamond surrounded by six small rubies , sparkled in the sunlight streaming through the windows . I thought of Papa , and my chest tightened . " Well , I 'm in favor of going with you , " Mama said . Grandmre dropped her coffee cup onto its saucer , and a spray of tan liquid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving Par-lange ! " she hissed . " I 'm not staying here and risking my daughters ' deaths . Or worse , having them grow up to be country bumpkins like the Cabanel girls , " Mama countered . Eulalie and Nanette Cabanel lived with their parents on a nearby plantation and were notorious for never wearing corsets , not even to pay calls or to attend church . Ever since Papa 's death , Mama had dreamed of Paris . She knew several women  --  Creole war widows like herself  --  who had moved to the City of Light and found , if not prosperity and happiness , at least a relative peace . The argument that day was never resolved . But the next evening , while Charles and I were playing backgammon on the gallery , a shell whirled past the house . We looked up and saw a group of Yankee soldiers and a cannon in the middle of the road . The adults were in the parlor talking , and they ran outside when they heard the shell 's high screech and , moments later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ striking and killing one of the dogs . " My God , they 're at our front door ! " Grandmre cried . Mama wanted to leave at once . Instead we spent the night on mattresses in the basement . Rochilieu and Grandmre snored , and the rest of us did n't get much sleep . The lone shell was apparently just a warning . Still , the next morning , Rochilieu said it was no longer safe for him at Parlange . If caught by the Federals , he 'd be taken prisoner ; if caught by the Rebels , he 'd be shot as a deserter . " I 'm leaving tonight , whether you come with me or not , " he said . He spent the day reading in the parlor , biding his time until night fell . No one said anything about our going with him , and I went to bed as usual at nine . Grandmre awoke me at midnight . Holding a lighted candle , she led me through the darkened house , past the bedrooms where Charles and Julie were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mama , with Valentine swaddled against her chest , were inkblots on the lawn below . Beside them , the horses moved restlessly under a magnolia tree . " You 're going with your mama and Lieutenant Rochilieu , " Grandmre said . " Julie and Charles are staying with me . " I ran to the barn to say good-bye to my chickens , Papillon and Sanspareil . Outside , Charles 's bear , Rossignol , was tethered to his post , asleep . " Farewell , Rossignol , " I sighed , feeling terrible that I had not had a chance to say good-bye to Charles himself . Back at the house , Grandmre tied a gunnysack around my waist . It was heavy and pulled at my abdomen whenever I took a step . " Mimi , this is very important , " she said . " There are enough gold coins in here to provide for you and your mother and sister in Paris , and you must never let it out of your sight , ever . Tu comprends ? If the soldiers stop you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed me on the forehead , then embraced Mama . In all my days at Parlange , I had never seen them touch each other . In fact , if I did n't know they were mother and daughter , I would have assumed they disliked each other , so chilly and formal were their relations . Yet now they gripped each other with a fierceness that frightened me . I started to cry . " What 's this ? What 's this ? " groused Rochilieu . " We ca n't have crying . You 'll bring the armies down on us . " Mama and Grandmre broke apart . Their faces were wet . We mounted our horses and trotted along the path by the cane fields , away from the house . The moon looked like a pearl button above the roof , and the air was sweet with the perfume of magnolias and jasmine . Under Rochilieu 's plan , we would make our way to Port Hudson on the east side of the Mississippi , then follow the Old County Road to New Orleans . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the Gulf of Mexico and the open sea , where we would flag down a French or English ship . As we rode through the forest , Valentine stayed as still as death . But Mama , who hated horseback riding , complained constantly about her mount , her saddle , her aching back . " Shut up ! " grunted Rochilieu . " For all we know , the Yanks or the Rebels are behind the next grove of trees . " He wiped the sweat from his brow with a handkerchief . Once , when a rabbit ran across the path , he clutched his chest and yelped . Mama was relying on God to see us through , and she mumbled prayers all night . At daybreak , we reached the Mississippi , where a rickety skiff was waiting on the bank . We piled into the leaky boat and pushed off . Rochilieu did the rowing . Mama held Valentine , and I lay against Mama 's legs with her shawl enfolding me . I fell asleep , and when I awoke , smoke from burning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A pool of water from the boat 's leaky bottom had risen and soaked my shoes . After a while , the baby began to cry . " Will you hold her a moment ? " Mama said . As I stood to take Valentine from her arms , a square of sunlight broke through the trees and blinded me momentarily . The boat rocked ; I stumbled . The sack of gold slid from my waist , vanishing into the muddy water with a loud plop and narrowly missing the black , scaly head of an alligator lurking nearby .
