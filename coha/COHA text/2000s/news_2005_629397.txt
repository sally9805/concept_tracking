<p> The photographers were screaming for Mariah Carey on Tuesday night the way they used to . They jostled to catch her eye backstage at the Billboard Music Awards and she vamped and smiled while holding a metal bouquet - she had won five awards , more than any other artist , and she was clearly thrilled . <p> Then she looked down at her wrists . <p> The weight of the trophies had left red lines up and down her inner forearms . Later , away from the crowd , in her suite atop the MGM Grand Hotel , she rubbed her arms at the memory . <p> " I ca n't give them anything to use against me , " she explained . " Someone , somewhere might see marks on my arms and the next day the world hears that I tried to kill myself or that I 'm getting tied up . That is how it is for me now . " <p> It is a wonderful and scary time to be Mariah Carey . While the Billboard awards are driven by sales , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annual Grammy Awards , the quality of her work was on the line . Carey picked up eight nominations , an acknowledgment of a career comeback that rivals any in pop-music history . <p> She calls her recent run a " beautiful dream , " but she 's also barely removed from a career nightmare . <p> Her descent <p> Almost four years ago , EMI 's Virgin Records famously fired Carey and paid $28 million to do it . At the time it seemed like a good deal . Carey had become famous for bizarre public behavior , sinking albums sales and starring in the year 's most ridiculed film , " Glitter " . Carey 's personal collapse was such a matter of public jeering that the rapper Eminem , who had a brief fling with the singer , chose to begin his arena concerts by piping in snippets of the tearful phone messages she had left at his home begging him to please return her calls . If there was any chance to escape the aura of disaster surrounding her , it ended when the " Glitter " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Then there were whispers of a nervous breakdown and suicide attempt . <p> " I never tried to kill myself ; that is a lie , " she said . " I 'm too afraid of God to do that . I 'm a spiritual person . The songs I write , the messages in them - how could I turn around and try to take my life . And by slashing my wrists ? Please . I would never give up on life . " <p> She has the most played song of the year , " Shake It Off " , and the second best-selling CD , " The Emancipation of Mimi " , a reference to her new sense of freedom and the nickname her friends still use . At midyear , she became the first act since the Beatles to have the No. 1 and 2 songs on American radio in the same week . In the past month , she circled the globe - London , Berlin , New York , Las Vegas - to collect awards and a measure of satisfaction . <p> According @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debut album in 1990 , more than 150 million Carey albums have shipped . <p> Her music career began with a demo album that was widely circulated in the industry and attracted plenty of attention , as did her reputation for possessing a rare eight-octave range . In 1990 , at the 33rd annual Grammy Awards , Carey won two Grammys including best new artist . With 16 No. 1 hits , she has a record that trails only Elvis Presley and the Beatles - and she wrote or co-wrote most of them ( " Most people do n't even know I write songs " ) . <p> Despite her commercial triumphs , she has found peer recognition hard to recapture - she 's not won another Grammy to date . <p> One reason for the chilly shoulder may have been Carey 's reputation as a kept canary . She found success under the wing of Tommy Mottola , Sony Music 's then chief , who shaped her as a singer similar to Celine Dion , known for epic material and melodramatic sweep . ( Their 1993 marriage ended in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finds difficult to discuss . ) <p> Now , Carey says , during the years with Mottola she longed to act on her creative impulses toward soul and hip-hop music . It was n't an option those around her wanted to explore . Instead , she says , she was counseled not only to bury any hip-hop sound but also to avoid discussion of her black roots . <p> Second coming <p> Even in the afterglow of this year and this night , those troubles still seem to haunt her . The 35-year-old plopped down on the couch in her 61st-floor suite , pulled off her sparkly high heels and grew reflective . Playing on her iPod in the corner was the Aretha Franklin music that she grew up loving . <p> " When I was a kid I felt like a misfit and an outcast - because of my ( biracial ) heritage and the way people made me feel about it , " the native New Yorker said , referring to the days when she could walk on neither side of her family and feel completely comfortable . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being told what to do , if you know what I mean - I was told to push all of that even further down , and it tore me up . " <p> Now that sound is anything but hidden . The new album 's dance-floor slink and urban inflections speak to her true music heart , she says . Unlike the days when she sang huge soaring ballads , the new album finds its core in songs of resilience - the hit " Shake It Off " , for one , has her shedding a bad-news lover . <p> But Carey 's return took more than her own voice . She also needed a new manager and found one in Benny Medina . He had worked with Jennifer Lopez and Brandy , found success with both , but also saw each of those relationships end in legal squabbles . Medina was wary of Carey . He had been watching TV like everyone else . <p> " I did n't know what to think . But she was smart , she invited me to a show to hear her sing - @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by watching her perform , " he said . " I also had plenty of ideas about different ways to do things . If you have Billie Holiday , you do n't need to put on a Cher show . " <p> She also found a producer in Jermaine Dupri , who wanted to bring her studio work closer to the street . Hers is a hybrid sound that melds R &B; melody with hip-hop breakbeat and pairs smoky singers with rap stars . Now Carey 's CD , in addition to being one of the year 's biggest hits and her " declaration of independence , " represents the dominant trend in R &B; music today . " Mariah helped invent this sound and does n't get enough credit for it , " said Dupri , who produced " Shake It Off " and " We Belong Together " , as well as other hits off the new Carey CD . " She does n't sound like anyone else . Now when you hear a song , it 's a Mariah song , and that 's hard to do these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's comeback may have presented itself to L.A. Reid , head of Island Def Jam Music Group , back in April when he visited a record store in New Jersey and casually asked a clerk how the newly arrived Carey album was selling . The answer shocked him . The clerk told him that the register had been busy ringing up the middle-school set . <p> " I never expected her to get new fans with this album ; I did n't see that coming , " he said . <p> With that in mind , Carey has added record-store autograph sessions to her busy schedule . One of those in Hollywood last month shut down traffic , as the once and future diva visited the Virgin Megastore to autograph copies of " Emancipation " . Later she recounted how many of the youngest fans told her that her new songs have helped them deal with broken hearts and broken homes . <p> " I 've had people tell me that these songs make them not want to kill themselves . Can you imagine how happy that makes me ? " @ @ @ @ @ @
