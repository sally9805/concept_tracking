<p> A week ago , everything looked and felt and even smelled differently for the 49ers . Then , it was musty , but joyous Candlestick Park , bursting at its creaky seams , awash in noise and hysteria for the Comeback Kids . This , instead , was total defeat , total domination , with no hint of a rousing finale . <p> In a gleaming new stadium on Florida 's west coast , the Tampa Bay Buccaneers ended the 49ers ' season two ways : gradually , and then suddenly . <p> Tampa Bay controlled nearly everything  --  the ball , the tempo , the fates  --  and did not stop until the final score was Bucs 31 , 49ers 6 in an NFC divisional playoff game . <p> When the Bucs did stop , their fans drank it all in , waving red and white flags back and forth at the final gun , saluting a home team headed to Philadelphia for the NFC Championship Game and making for a picture dripping in Tampa Bay energy and cheer . <p> There was no mystery at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better team , a more rested team , a motivated team  --  and , as happens to the inferior team in January , had their season terminated in short order . The 49ers had the look of a team that went as far as it should go , to the NFC divisional round , and no further . <p> " They took the game , " 49ers quarterback Jeff Garcia said , " from the get-go . " <p> There could , conceivably , be talk of the 49ers ' battered defense enduring another painful injury , losing starting cornerback Ahmed Plummer on the game 's 13th play from scrimmage , leaving the maligned unit with both starting cornerbacks out , and ripe for Tampa Bay quarterback Brad Johnson 's picking . <p> But all involved said that injuries are part of the nature of this swift and violent game , and by the close of 60 minutes of play , the 49ers ' defense had been beaten so thoroughly , and their offense suffocated so convincingly , that there was not much left to say . <p> Said Bucs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to detract from his team 's arrival at the NFC Championship Game : " That 's the way football is . . . . Pros are paid to play , and the best team wins . " <p> A week ago , Garcia ran the liberated and confident run of the best player on the field . This week , he was not . The fast and furious Tampa Bay defense , statistically the NFL 's best , did not let him scramble once , and intercepted him three times . <p> " You did n't think you were going to see that , did you ? " said Tampa Bay 's All-Pro defensive tackle , Warren Sapp . " Wrong stadium , wrong team , wrong coast . That 's on the other coast that that works . " <p> A week ago , the 49ers ' defense rode a second-half wave of energy to stifle New York 's attack . This week , lining up rookie Mike Rumph and seldom-used Rashad Holman at corners , using bottom-of-the-roster corner Duane Hawthorne in nickel , and with starting safety Zack Bronson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sieve , too generous and too easily beaten . <p> It allowed four Tampa Bay touchdowns in the first half alone . That defense could not pressure Johnson , nor could it cover his receivers , nor could it stop the Bucs on third down , when the normally weak Tampa Bay offense converted eight times in 10 tries in the first half . <p> Tampa Bay ran 43 plays to the 49ers ' 21 in the first half , held the ball for 19:51 of the first half , crushed the 49ers ' will in the first half . <p> " You ca n't win , " tight end Eric Johnson said , " without the ball . " <p> Said Tampa Bay safety John Lynch , who watched from the luxury of the sidelines as the Bucs ' offense asserted its dominance : " So much credit goes to our offense . . . . We were n't on the field at all . " <p> Those rare times the 49ers had the ball , even the great and explosive receiver Terrell Owens was rendered mute . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when Garcia was n't under extreme heat  --  he was sacked four times , tying a season-high  --  he could not find No. 81 anywhere in the sea of Tampa red and pewter . <p> Owens caught just four balls for 35 yards , his worst game since September . Last year , after a playoff loss in Green Bay , Owens spoke harshly about his lack of opportunities . This year , he did not speak to reporters , leaving the Bucs to crow about shutting down the flamboyant player who gives the 49ers so much energy . <p> " We had their man bracketed . . . . T. O. was not open , " Sapp said . " He was looking for places to go , and there was nowhere to go . " <p> The numbers do not lie . Those who believed the 49ers could run on the Bucs , or control the Bucs with short passes , can look at the assorted stats . The 49ers ' 228 total yards was a season low , the 49ers ' time of possession ( 23:14 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yards rushing is the only time he has been blanked all season . <p> " Jeff was under duress , " coach Steve Mariucci said . " Facing the league 's best defense when we were n't quite as sharp ; we had more pressures and hits on our quarterback than we usually do . And when they get ahead , they get in their track stances on defense . It gets rough . " <p> The Bucs have shut down mobile quarterbacks before , notably beating Atlanta 's Michael Vick in both meetings this season . Garcia said he would run around to the edges and find nothing ; he said he would try to look for rushing lanes to scramble , and never found them . He was stymied . <p> " That team speed , and they 're very disciplined , " Garcia said . " I was n't able to create anything . There really were n't any lanes to run to . I could n't beat anybody around the corner or find anyone open . . . . That 's the difference between the Giants ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was , maybe , a time very early the 49ers had a chance . Holman intercepted Johnson on the game 's first series , giving the 49ers the ball on the Tampa 40 and an opportunity to scare the Bucs . Instead , on a 3rd-and-5 , Garcia saw a blitz coming and tripped over center Jeremy Newberry 's foot . He fell down . The 49ers punted from the Tampa 40 , and it went 14 yards . Call it foreshadowing . <p> Three plays into the Bucs ' drive , Plummer went down with a dislocated shoulder , and the 49ers were reeling . Johnson went after them , and the drive ended with fullback Mike Alstott scoring from the 2 . On the sideline , Sapp and the defense glowed . Asked when the defense had its comfort zone on the 49ers , Sapp did n't blink : " At 7-0 , " he said . <p> The game still was young , and Garcia put together some effective short passes , then hit Tai Streets on a catch-and-run for 30 yards to the 4 . Here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for J. J. Stokes , running back Kevan Barlow lost 2 yards , and Garcia was forced into an incompletion out of the end zone . Jeff Chandler was summoned , and it was 7-3 . <p> " To end up with three points , " Garcia said , " in the long run , that haunts you . " <p> The game slipped away . Johnson found third receiver Joe Jurevicius from 20 yards out against a flailing secondary , and it was 14-3 . Another 49ers drive stalled at the 22 , and Chandler made it 14-6 , but no matter : Johnson forced safety Tony Parrish into a 36-yard pass-interference call by throwing deep , then hit a wide-open Ricky Dudley from 12 yards on a rollout . Tampa Bay led 21-6 and the 49ers would not answer . <p> When Garcia , harried , threw into double coverage for an interception to Derrick Brooks , the outcome was a formality . Alstott ran in again from 2 yards out , and the 28-6 score was more than daunting  --  it was poison . <p> Grim stuff for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met the end of a stop-and-start season that left the team groping for definition . Some tried to find good things in the season , pointing to an NFC West title , the first since 1997 , and a playoff win  --  the first since the 1998 season . <p> " ' It 's a tough way to end it , certainly , and I 'm sure it will stay with us for a while , " said Mariucci . " But this team has got to know that we made progress . " <p> Garcia called the season " a step forward , " and perhaps , in some analyses , considering reams of defensive injuries , it was . But for the fifth consecutive season , a 49ers organization that judges campaigns by Super Bowls and not by " steps , " did not reach the NFC title game . <p> It was that sour feeling that hung in the air . Garcia showed as much when he briskly left his locker at the end of a tiring session with reporters , body language tense , and slammed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the team bus . <p> HELD DOWN <p> Sunday 's loss to Tampa Bay was the fourth time the 49ers have been held to less than seven points in a playoff game .
