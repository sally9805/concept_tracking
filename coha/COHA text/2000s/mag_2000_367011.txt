The grade-school drawing looked typically innocent , at least in its style . The subjects were two stick figures , one of them wearing a loopy smile . But the teacher in San Bernardino , Calif. , who found it stowed in a student 's desk was alarmed by the story line . One grinning stick figure wielded a gun . The other , frowning , had just been shot . <P> The sketch , from the hand of an eight-year-old with a penchant for nasty temper tantrums , was drawn only days after a six-year-old in Michigan fatally shot a classmate , so school officials decided to be on the safe side . They brought the drawing to the attention of Gary Underwood , chief of police for the city 's public schools , who ran the child 's case through the department 's new computer " threat-assessment " program , called Mosaic-2000 . With a battery of 42 questions  --  Is the student harassed by peers ? Has the student recently experienced rejection ?  --  Mosaic purports to calculate rough odds on whether a child will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agencies to examine threats made against their personnel , Mosaic software is now being field-tested in about 20 public school districts from Jonesboro , Ark. , to Los Angeles to Salem , Ore . In its assessment of the stick-figure artist , the program suggested that the boy shared several traits with past violent offenders and guided the school to put him in counseling and under close watch . " When those kids walked into Columbine with bombs , no one was expecting it , " says Underwood . " We 're now on alert if this child comes into school with a bulge in his pocket . " <P> This is the level of vigilance in the American public school a year after Columbine . On average , it may be a safer place than ever  --  the number of school-associated violent deaths dropped 40% from 1997 through 1999  --  but it feels scarier with each new well-publicized shooting and threat . In the year since the Columbine massacre , understandably nervous school officials have cycled through a series of responses , from lock-down drills to see-through knapsacks , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . <P> Now , though , administrators are quietly shifting their sights from metal detectors to " mental detectors . " Commonly known as profilers , these programs aim to detect violence-prone kids before they act by comparing them to those who have already snapped . Investigators from Columbine and Jonesboro have tutored administrators across the U.S. on the telltale signs that in their cases went tragically undetected or unheeded . The FBI , which last fall circulated a 20-point " offender profile " culled from common characteristics of school shooters , will release a report on the topic next month . And the Secret Service , at work on its own study , is interviewing school shooters to see what makes them tick  --  and then explode . <P> Along with its findings , the Secret Service plans to give schools an instructional video and a set of probative questions . In addition , numerous questionnaires and checklists are being sold by private firms or drawn up by school officials themselves . One screening test for students is titled simply " Questions for Killers . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
