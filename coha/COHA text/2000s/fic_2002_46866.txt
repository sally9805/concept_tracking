After a long stretch of primarily writing movie novelizations , Bob Thurston returned to the form of short fiction recently with favorable results such as " Slipshod , at the Edge of the Universe " ( Feb. 2001 ) and " The World 's Light Heavyweight Champion in Nineteen Twenty-Something " ( June 2001 ) . His new story is a think-piece that grew out of a class discussion on Gilgamesh in the humanities course he teaches at New Jersey City University . <p> WANT TO LIVE FOREVER . Yeah , well ? You have the power . Yeah , well ? Make me immortal , damn it . Remember Gilgamesh . Gilgamesh ? He 's a character in a Mesopotamian epic who wanted to live forever , and he settled for becoming young again , and he lost both . So what 's your point ? Remember Shangri-La , where living long is won at a cost - you can stay young only within its borders , shriveling into old age as soon as you pass back into the world . Or remember Gulliver 's Travels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nevertheless ravaged by age . They are just skin hanging off bones and their memory is disappearing - they 're immortal , yes , but vegetables forever . Okay , so I do n't want to be stuck in one place , and I do n't want to live forever but grow old anyway . I just want to live forever , no aging , perfect health , all the perks , none of the drawbacks . No tricks , just live forever . I promise no tricks . Still , there are limits to what a person can do , even with centuries to work with . You are , to be frank , no genius and even geniuses would be bored after centuries of immortality . Your first few centuries might be exciting , but eventually you 'll have been there , done that . Been there , done everything . What do you do then ? Sulk for a few centuries ? I 'd rather sulk than die . Put it on a bumper sticker , if you like . After sulking , what then ? What if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get suicidal . You ca n't commit suicide . No matter what depths of despair you reach , you will have to go on . A kind of super  --  existentialism . Makes me shudder all over . Whatever happens , you 're stuck . You 'll be there . If civilization dies out , you 'll be there . If the world blows up and crumbles beneath your feet , you 'll be there . You 're assuming that humankind will not travel the universe . If Earth is gone , I can be , oh , on some other planet in some other star system with a colony of Earth people that has evolved into a utopian society and solved the woes of the universe . And you ? What will be your role in this perfect place ? What do you mean ? If these people have evolved and you , no genius remember , are there among them , how will they regard you ? I do n't get you . Remember your limitations . If you reach your limit , your potential , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for your utopian society in your perfect place in a still-intact solar system , with humans who have developed according to the accumulated needs of centuries , you 'll be pretty stupid , by their standards . Your place in their perfect society will be as their equivalent to the village idiot . You do n't know that . Oh , but I do . I 'll take the chance . I 'll be the idiot , but I 'm the one living forever . I 'll find ways to accommodate . You have the power . You do have the power , right ? Well , yeah . Then give me the pill , inject me , wave your wand and transform me , put me on your Frankenstein table and run bolts of lightning through me . Whatever . Make me immortal . Well .... Wait ! I want to rephrase . Make me immortal , in perfect health , without aging or all the drawbacks . Immortal with no drawbacks . Make me immortal as I am now . You can do that , right ? Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have to be sure . I never do anything without being sure . Just what do you want ? I always want everything to be for the best . I do n't want to perform any act that would hurt any individual . I hate all the times I 've done something like that and felt bad afterward . I 'll risk it . No guilt for you . I did n't mean guilt . Just feeling bad . Who cares what you feel ? Just do your job . Why 're you hesitating ? How about I just give you your youth back , any age you want ? No way , no . I 'm not that old . You 're just talking a few extra years . If I was ninety it might be a good deal but You wo n't make ninety . You 're sure of that ? Well , yeah . So , a jump back to your youth might be the ticket . Then you can live right and make sure you reach ninety . Way things are going , all this DNA-genome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get a century , century and a half , maybe more than two hundred years . Not a bad deal . But living forever 's better . I want to live forever . Understand ? I want to live forever . Well , okay . So do it . I just did it . But - but how can I tell ? You 'll probably be sure after a century or two or three . You 'll be able to tell , after others are dying off and you 're still standing . But you could be a fraud , right ? Well , yeah . You could tell me I 'll live forever and I wo n't know you 're a liar until I die . Well How do I know I can trust you ? You came to me . That suggests you believe I can do it . I did it . So grin and bear it . By the way , your teeth are forever , too . Do n't have them pulled out . Do n't even have a crown put in . Crowns wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might not be dentists in the future and you 'll have a mouth full of jagged pointed teeth . Makes for inconvenient.chewing , you know . I should be indestructible . Not only my teeth but all of me . Indestructible 's a different order . I do n't even do indestructible . You said you would n't trick me . No trick . Just a fact . An observation really . Chances are nobody 'll remove anything from you . Remove ? Even though I 'm immortal , things can be removed ? Well , yeah . How ? Some swordsman of the future wants to slice off your arm , then whack he slices off your arm . What happens to the arm ? ... Why do n't you answer ? Sorry . It was just not the question I expected . What do you mean , expected ? Most people , self-involved as they are , would reply what happens to me , armless , not what happens to the arm . Well , what does happen to the arm ? It 's immortal , like the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's put . If it does get sliced off , you should be sure to collect it , see about reattaching possibilities .... You 've been silent there for a long time . Oh . I was just picturing myself armless and legless . Like in that novel about World War I , where the soldier lives on without limbs in a hospital . But with me it 's armless and legless forever ? Seems so . My immortality ... my immortality ... my immortality is ... my immortality . Well , I guess I 'll have to be very careful , right ? Well , yeah . What does it mean , really ? What do you mean , what does it mean ? I mean , how do I handle this immortality stuff ? I suppose you will just live your life cautiously , very cautiously , avoiding risk . Just like you 've been living it so far . I can do that . I 'll watch a lot of videotapes and DVDs . Until electricity goes . I 'll write an eternal memoir . Until paper disintegrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovers . Until other methods of fertilization replace sex and sex organs become vestigial . You 're kidding . Well , yeah . In a way . I 'm tired of talking to you . I 'm leaving . Be sure not to be buried in an avalanche or in lava . Okay . Stop . Be sure not to be trapped in a cave or stranded on an asteroid . I 'm going . Be sure not to catch fire . Be especially sure of that . Good-bye . Bye . ... Thought you 'd left . I 'll go . Soon . Not just yet . Well , I have an errand . If you 're here when I return , we 'll talk . You 've got plenty of time for talking . Yes . But not much to say . Saying that is the first step . To what ? Who knows ? You do n't know and that 's the important thing to know . I do n't get it . You have to , now that you 're immortal . Here . This is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or satellite . You 'll have to make do . Get out of my face , will ya ? I 'll go . So go . I 'm going . Going . Hey , I thought you said no tricks . Gone .
