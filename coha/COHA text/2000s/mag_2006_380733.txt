Like many physicists who worked on the Manhattan Project , Richard Feynman could not get the Bomb out of his mind after the war . " I would see people building a bridge , " he wrote . " And I thought , they 're crazy , they just do n't understand , they do n't understand . Why are they making new things ? It 's so useless . " <P> Feynman was convinced man had finally invented something that he could not control and that would ultimately destroy him . For six decades we have suppressed that thought and built enough history to believe Feynman 's pessimism was unwarranted . After all , soon afterward , the most aggressive world power , Stalin 's Soviet Union , acquired the Bomb , yet never used it . Seven more countries have acquired it since and never used it either . Even North Korea , which huffs and puffs and threatens every once in a while , dares not use it . Even Kim Jong Il is not suicidal . <P> But that 's the point . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extreme and fanatical religious ideology , undeterred by the usual calculations of prudence and self-preservation , is wielding state power and will soon be wielding nuclear power . <P> We have difficulty understanding the mentality of Iran 's newest rulers . Then again , we do n't understand the mentality of the men who flew into the World Trade Center or the mobs in Damascus and Tehran who chant " Death to America "  --  and Denmark ( ! )  --  and embrace the glory and romance of martyrdom . <P> This atavistic love of blood and death and , indeed , self-immolation in the name of God may not be new  --  medieval Europe had an abundance of millennial Christian sects  --  but until now it has never had the means to carry out its apocalyptic ends . <P> That is why Iran 's arriving at the threshold of nuclear weaponry is such a signal historical moment . It is not just that its President says crazy things about the Holocaust . It is that he is a fervent believer in the imminent reappearance of the 12th Imam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been reported as saying in official meetings that the end of history is only two or three years away . He reportedly told an associate that on the podium of the General Assembly last September , he felt a halo around him and for " those 27 or 28 minutes , the leaders of the world did not blink ... as if a hand was holding them there and it opened their eyes to receive " his message . He believes that the Islamic revolution 's raison d ' tre is to prepare the way for the messianic redemption , which in his eschatology is preceded by worldwide upheaval and chaos . How better to light the fuse for eternal bliss than with a nuclear flame ? <P> Depending on your own beliefs , Ahmadinejad is either mystical or deranged . In either case , he is exceedingly dangerous . And Iran is just the first . With infinitely accelerated exchanges of information helping develop whole new generations of scientists , extremist countries led by similarly extreme men will be in a position to acquire nuclear weaponry . If nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not just one but many radical states will get weapons of mass extinction , and then so will the fanatical and suicidal terrorists who are their brothers and clients .
