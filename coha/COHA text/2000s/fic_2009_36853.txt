The Beginning of the End of Me <br> I should probably back up and explain what made me compose the Seven Misconceptions in the first place , along with my Last Will and Testament . The short answer is easy enough : I wrote them down when I was afraid that my death was a heck of a lot closer than " someday , " that the time frame which constituted The Rest of My Life was less an era and more an instant . I am still not sure if this conviction came from the physical symptoms occurring at the time , or the fresh realization that both of my parents were dead and , logically , I must be next . Every time I imagined leaving my son , Max , just two years old , I began committing all that I could remember to paper . And once I started , I realized that I also had to explain what was going on with my cousin , Alecia . Not just because , outside of my mother , she knew me best , but also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crash at her apartment for the two months before her wedding , everything changed for her as well . " The Beginning of the End  --  of Me ! " she has since joked . <br> And so , if I am going to backtrack , I may as well start one humid day , early August , when Alecia and her fiancT , Ben , picked us up at the Pittsburgh airport . After ten hours of traveling , Max was in remarkably good spirits : high-fiving the flight attendants on the way out of the plane and , despite that he had n't seen them in over a year , gleefully kicking his legs in his stroller at the sight of my cousin and her mate . When Max asked , " We in Pittsburgh ? " Ben staggered backward a few steps , as if blown away that my son could actually speak . <br> In baggage claim , after my fourth suitcase had been retrieved , Ben joked , " Jesus , are you guys moving in ? " and I glanced up from my carpetbag , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown eyes flashing with panic that may have been mirroring my own . It seemed far too early to have to explain . Still rooting around in my oversized purse , I mumbled , " Housewarming gift 's here somewhere , " and wished I could dazzle them by producing a full-size floor lamp from the bag , a la Mary Poppins . Instead , my hands found the edge of a small box , which I offered with apology and high hopes . <br> " A Ken doll ? " Alecia asked , after ripping off the paper rather unceremoniously . <br> " Outback Ken . " I did my best to make my voice sound like Crocodile Dundee 's : " He likes a bit of adventure , mate . " <br> I 'm still not sure why Alecia acted so utterly baffled when for years  --  actual adult years  --  of our lives we 'd written letters as our Barbie doll alter egos . <br> " For Meg to marry , " I said . " Remember ? " <br> " If Meg is n't a doll , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mail order groom . " Ben laughed as he threw another suitcase onto our cart . <br> " Building a tower ! " Max said and then clapped . <br> I explained to Ben how none of our Ken dolls were actually named Ken . They were Brian or Kevin or Lance or Derek . " And we could never find one good enough for Meg . " Meg , of course , belonged to Alecia . <br> Ben nodded solemnly . " I 'm pretty sure I saw all of them in the album . " <br> " Oh , you kept it ! " I turned to Alecia . <br> " Well , yeah , I kept it . But it 's not like I 've looked at it in years . I do n't even know where my dolls went . " Alecia glanced over her shoulder as if someone might recognize her . <br> " Am I remembering wrong ? Meg is still single , right ? " I asked . <br> " That 's all about to change . " Ben wrapped an arm around Alecia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if I was n't supposed to . <br> " Make tower higher ? " Max asked , pointing at the suitcases . <br> " Oh , Boo . We 're done . This is all we brought . " <br> Ben glanced at Alecia , and then asked it again : " How long are you guys staying ? " <br> " Indefinitely ? " I asked and then watched as their smiles turned plastic , not unlike Outback Ken 's eternal grin . " Just until I get on my feet , " I added , never imagining just how long that would actually take . <br> Holly , Ben 's twin sister , happens to be a doctor and thus , often makes people rate their pain on a scale of one to ten . Even if you 're just talking about a chore you have to get done or complaining of someone being a pain in the ass , she loves to quantify it in numbers . <br> So , I put Ben on the spot one day and made him rate the pain of Max and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't care about Alecia 's perception of things , but she had such an inflated sense of discomfort ( the premarital counseling required by her church was often labeled a ten , the traffic on Route 28 a ten and a half ) that I was certain we ranked well above natural childbirth . We 'd been there for about a month , and yes , the timing of the question was a bit calculated , considering he 'd just dipped a wooden spoon into my homemade Bolognese sauce for tasting . The way his eyes closed and his head swayed to the side could only be described as swooning . Zero , I thought . Say zero . <br> " Three , " Ben finally said , opening his eyes . " At any given time . But it 's tough because pain is a very fluid thing . Like , you being here right now ? It 's great . " <br> Which meant that at other times , our presence must 've reached at least a six , understandable , of course , in a cramped apartment such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Alecia would 've pointed out that Max woke us up at seven o'clock on Saturday mornings , and how his Matchbox cars had tripped each one of us at least twice , and how he 'd broken her favorite vase before it was even unwrapped . Still , it would n't have rocked me in quite the same way . After all , Alecia and I had the history of our entire childhood , not just sharing Barbie dolls , but everything else as well . As surrogate sisters , we were supposed to find each other 's presence both completely exasperating and altogether comforting . <br> The disappointing part was that it was Ben calling us painful . Ben who loved my cooking , who 'd called me brilliant , or at least , said that my collages were . ( I 'd overheard him defending me one night , when Alecia was complaining about my habit of cannibalizing magazines for the purpose of art . " Just for once , I want to pick up a People and be able to read it without half of the words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was possible I 'd developed a crush on my soon-to-be cousin  --  the innocent kind of crush . <br> That day in the kitchen , as Ben went on about how his pain was really a mere aggravation , not specific to Max or me , per se , but toward any guest who might compromise his ritual of walking around naked at night , I realized for certain that my crush on him was most certainly not of the romantic variety . I did n't want to imagine him naked . Still , it was a confusing sort of affection . <br> Before sauce dripped all over the floor , I reached for the wooden spoon in his hand . " We 're going to move out soon . I promise . " <br> " Do n't move . I mean , go when you 're ready . But do n't worry about me . I love having Max here . It 's great practice for us . And thanks to you , I 've gained five pounds , " Ben added , patting his new gut . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alecia , which is also a very fluid thing . And I 'm marrying her . " <br> I still did n't ask , even if his eyes were goading me to . It seemed more than disloyal : I was suddenly worried he might change his mind about her . And just to make sure he did n't change his mind about me , I kept cooking . <br> " Oh , my God , Di . This pork is amazing , " Ben said a few days later , early September , when we were sitting around the dining room table . " What did you do to it ? " <br> " I brined it in salt water with twenty cloves of garlic . " I laughed when he groaned . <br> " Baby , do you see this ? " Ben turned to Alecia . " You can cut it with a butter knife . Who can cut pork with a butter knife ? " <br> " Great . We get it . The meat is juicy . Ra-ra , " Alecia said , spearing a carrot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his fork . <br> " So , Di , where 'd you apply today ? " Alecia asked . <br> The question always made me feel as if I was starring in one of those reality shows where people were constantly fired or voted off . Next Alecia would ask me to pack my bags and leave the apartment immediately . <br> " The Dressbarn . " I gave Max another bite of garlic pork . " But I think they want someone with retail experience . " <br> Alecia curled her lip . I knew she would n't be happy , considering she 'd begged me to apply at Banana Republic so I could get her a discount . " Is that why you 're dressed for the farm ? " she asked , with a nod toward my tank top and overalls . <br> " I wore a skirt and blouse for the interview , if that 's what you mean . " Lucky for me , peasant tops had come back into style , and an even flimsier version of my own could actually be found at some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't think their dresses are actually manufactured in a barn . " <br> " You 're never going to get a job with your hair in braids . " When I flipped my head around to show her it was just a single , she added , " One braid or two , it does n't matter ! And when you pull your hair back , you can see your bald spot ! " <br> It was a disconcerting fact : I seemed to be losing my hair that summer and , as of a few weeks before , had even acquired a small bald patch . I 'd been falsely assuming that no one else could see it . <br> Continues ...
