Cheating has taken hold of our culture , and were all the worse for it . Exactly how can fabricated news stories , tax evasion , and pirated music lead to the kingdom of God ? // BACK WHEN WE HAD MORE INVESTIGATIVE JOURnalists than embedded reporters most of us thought we could trust a free press to tell us the unspun truth , but that is no longer the case . In 1983 , a decade after Woodward and Bernstein blew the lid off Watergate , 80 percent of Americans trusted what they read in their newspapers . Last year less than 60 percent of us believed what we read in them . Some of the problem is a corporate-owned media too timid to ask a lot of tough questions , and some of it is that a number of reporters at our best and biggest newspapers have been making up or stealing their answers . In May of last year The New York Times acknowledged that one of its rising young journalists was a liar and a cheat . Jayson Blair had made up or stolen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , and his superiors had either missed or ignored his fictions and plagiarizing . The ensuing scandal resulted in the firing of the Times ' executive editor Howell Raines and managing editor Gerald Boyd . This spring USA Today , America 's largest newspaper , announced that its star foreign correspondent had committed scores of similar offenses . In his more than two decades with the paper , Jack Kelley had made up parts of at least 20 stories and plagiarized materials from other sources more than a hundred times . Nominated five times for a Pulitzer Prize , Kelley had fabricated tales about slipping into Kosovo with guerrilla fighters , meeting with Egyptian terrorists , joining a hunt for Osama bin Laden , interviewing Cuban boat people , and witnessing a terrorist bombing in Jerusalem . Time and again fellow reporters questioned the credibility of Kelley 's stories , but senior management refused to move against him . So when Kelley 's journalistic house of cards collapsed , three top editors were forced to resign as well . Blair and Kelley were not the only blemishes on this year @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and USA Today scandals more than a dozen major and minor newspapers admitted that one of their reporters had fabricated or plagiarized parts of stories . The rogue 's gallery included the Chicago Tribune , The Vancouver Sun , the Iowa State Daily , the News Tribune of Tacoma , Washington , and the Macon , Georgia Telegraph . Still , not all the liars and cheats were journalists . The Hartford Courant in Connecticut installed anti-plagiarism software when editors there discovered that a piece submitted by a university president contained several uncited passages . Why all this cheating ? Competition for celebrity status could explain why some journalists cut ethical corners ( and why their editors turn a blind eye ) . Jayson Blair wanted to be a star reporter , and both Jack Kelley and his employers coveted the prestige of a Pulitzer . But Blair lacked the work ethic to earn his prize , and USA Today wanted to get great stories without paying for foreign correspondents who knew the facts . Cheating might also be on the upswing in newsrooms because the Internet has made it so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ camps from the comfort of one 's hotel room , cutting and pasting reports from other sources and stories without having to do the leg or brain work of personal interviews or original research . Unfortunately for Blair and Kelley , improved technology has also made it easier to detect and catch cheaters. // WHATEVER THE CAUSES , DAVID CALLAHAN BELIEVES THE rising tide of cheaters is not confined to America 's newsrooms . In this year 's The Cheating Culture : Why More Americans Are Doing Wrong to Get Ahead ( Harcourt ) , Callahan reports that " cheating is everywhere . " According to the public policy researcher , a staggering number of Americans are " breaking the rules to get ahead academically , professionally , or financially . " Callahan admits that cheating is as old as humanity and that there have always been cheaters in America but contends that cheating has been on the upswing in our society in the past few decades . He argues that a plague of dishonesty has spread through the professions , infected athletics , and invaded the ranks of academe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " have been inventing their own morality lately . Tens of millions of ordinary middle-class Americans routinely commit serious crimes ranging from tax evasion ( a felony ) , to auto insurance fraud ( also a felony ) , to cable television theft ( yes , a felony , as well , in some states ) , to Internet piracy of music and software ( more felonies ) . " As Callahan sees it , a cutthroat economy where the divide between winners and losers has grown into a chasm is the primary reason Americans are cheating in record numbers . A generation of corporate greed and government deregulation has made cheating more attractive , easier to get away with , and less costly for the few who do manage to get caught . As economic inequality skyrockets , fewer in the middle and working classes believe there is a level playing field or a reason to follow the rules . And as the costs of losing in a brutally competitive economy continue to climb , more people are ready to cheat to get ahead . According to Donald McCabe of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are also teaching our children to cheat . McCabe , who has studied cheating among college and high school students , reports that dishonesty is way up among both groups . In a 1999 survey of more than 2,000 college students across the country , three out of four of them admitted to having cheated on a test or a paper . Two years later the rate of cheating on papers had jumped 10 percent . Meanwhile , recent surveys of high school students indicate that more than a third of them admit to having cheated - and that the numbers climb as students get older . Improved technology is one reason for more cheating . The same software that made it easy for Blair and Kelley to plagiarize articles lets students cut and - paste their papers off the Internet . Plus , there 's a cottage industry of websites selling papers to anyone with a credit card where their conscience should be , and students who want to cheat on tests now have a wide range of handheld gadgets into which crib sheets and answers can be downloaded or transmitted . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people who cut corners get ahead . " Cynicism and the pressure to succeed also contribute to the growth of cheating . Convinced that their elders in the real world cheat with abandon , many students say they have to cut corners to stay ahead of the curve or to win a spot at the right school or firm . And as more students cheat , more feel pressured to cheat just to keep up or because " everybody else is doing it " CHEATING IS THE LOGICAL CONCLUSION of individualism run amok . When we cheat , we act as if we were alone in the universe , as if the rules that oblige everyone else to play fair did not apply to us . When we cheat , we behave as if we were free to ignore the covenants that tether us to the rest of humanity . Our cheating does more than rob and abuse others , it dissolves the glue that holds communities together , making us enemies and strangers . Jesus announces a peaceful kingdom in which we will be neighbor and friend to all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gang of thieves who can no longer trust or rely on one another , who are uninterested in contributing to the common good , who are incapable of love or justice . That seems like an apt description of hell . Perhaps that is because the path there is paved with shortcuts . Sidebar When any of us cheats , we act as if we were alone in the universe , as if the rules that oblige everyone else to play fair did not apply to us .
