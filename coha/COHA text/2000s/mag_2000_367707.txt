How does a place seared by its past find its future ? How does it move on , even as the nation as a whole is burying its history every minute with the invention of the next microchip or the launch of a new dotcom ? " We ca n't worry about what 's going on on Wall Street , " says Mayor James Wilson . " We 've got to worry about what 's going on on Main Street . " And right now , Cairo 's Main Street is like an open scar left over from the day in 1967 when a black man was found hanged in jail and the town blew wide open . At the turn of the century , Cairo had vied with Chicago and St. Louis to be the commercial capital of the Midwest , with money pouring in off the barges and trains that converged at this point , where the Ohio and the Mississippi conjoin . But the levees it erected to keep the floods out also hemmed Cairo in . Now the town wants to extract itself from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been turned into a museum , glorifying its days of big grain and big gambling . The old Gem Theater is being restored . And the Riverlore mansion , once owned by a riverboat captain , is being converted into a bed-and-breakfast . There 's a plan to rent out the dead downtown stores for a $1 a year . And Cairo has even secured a $1.5 million grant to give Main Street its original cobblestone beauty , with streetlights for evening strolling . No one is strolling yet . History has taught Cairo to hold its breath .
