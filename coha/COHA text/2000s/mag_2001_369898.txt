PRODUCT Portable mats and other hot uses of the tacky old flooring <P> HOW IT STARTED The ' 50s-design rage spurred inventive young artists in California to kitsch up <P> JUDGMENT CALL Wacky , but way sharp . What 's next , AstroTurf ? <P> With Eames chairs and bark-cloth drapes coming back into vogue , it was only a matter of time before linoleum floors joined the retro-design boom . MTV 's offices in Santa Monica , Calif. , are covered with the stuff , while Jack Nicholson , Ted Danson and Phil Collins have all had intricate hand-cut floors inlaid at their homes by Hollywood designer Laurie Crogan . The tacky old sheeting product has also been refashioned into modern " linoleum rugs . " They were born in L.A. a few years back , when abstract painter Christopher Stearns decided to cover up his apartment 's ugly kitchen with portable mats rather than install permanent flooring . He chose linoleum for its high kitsch factor as well as its unique feel . <P> " I liked the idea of being somewhat irreverent with this institutional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And because it 's made from cork dust , it has a surprisingly pliable plushness . " Along with marketing partner M. Dwight Freeman , he launched Westling Design , offering his durable , handmade creations in bold grid , dot and zigzag patterns that recall art by Mondrian , Kandinsky and Escher . They 're not cheap  --  priced at around $40 per sq . ft. , a 6-ft. by 8-ft. area rug costs nearly $2,000 . But just think of all those hours you 'll save on vacuuming . <P>  --  By Jeffrey Ressner
