<p> &lt;&gt;Standoff with North Korea&lt;&gt; <p> SEOUL , South Korea  --  Someone had been riding in Dear Leader 's private elevator and left a cigarette butt in the ashtray . The nervous circle of bodyguards , sycophants and young women around Kim Jong Il , then known as North Korea 's " Dear Leader , " knew the culprit would pay for this insolence . <p> The guilty man proved to be one of Kim 's longest-serving bodyguards . He and his family were arrested soon after the mid-1980s incident and sent into North Korea 's prison system , from which few emerge alive . Kim made sure everyone got the message . <p> " If I did anything wrong , I knew that not only I could be killed , but my whole family could be killed , " recalls Lee Young Kook , another bodyguard who served Kim for 10 years before defecting to South Korea in 1999 . <p> In the standoff over North Korea 's nuclear weapons program , the United States is facing one of the strangest strongmen the modern world has seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Mao jackets , hard liquor , young women and slasher flicks . He 's a man who imprisons a loyal servant for using the wrong ashtray , a film buff who pays homage to a favorite actress by having her kidnapped . <p> But those who know him say the bizarre behavior of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il masks a sharp mind , a restless energy and a ruthless determination to hold onto the power he inherited from his father , dictator Kim Il Sung . <p> In the nine years since the death of his father , Kim Jong Il has played a weak hand well , if you measure success by his ability to stay in power and overlook the miseries his rule has inflicted on his country 's 22 million people . <p> In the current nuclear confrontation , Kim Jong Il has exploited the U.S. preoccupation with Iraq and a rising tide of anti-Americanism in South Korea to try to threaten and cajole a reluctant United States into agreeing to talks with his isolated regime . <p> " You have to separate politics from his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North Korea expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification , a government think tank in Seoul . " He 's the leader of a country . He 's not dumb . " <p> " He 's not a nut , " former secretary of State Madeleine Albright , who met Kim in 2000 , recently told Newsweek . " He 's isolated but not uninformed . " <p> The confrontation started three months ago when the United States said North Korea admitted it was pursuing nuclear weapons in violation of an agreement reached in 1994 with the Clinton administration . ( Under the agreement , the North was to shut down a nuclear reactor and a plutonium-processing plant at Yongbyon and suspend construction on two larger reactors . The North also agreed to U.N . monitoring of the Yongbyon site to ensure compliance with the agreement . In exchange , the United States agreed to help North Korea build two light-water reactors and to provide fuel oil to North Korea to produce electricity until the light-water reactors were built . ) <p> Since October , North Korea has notched up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Yongbyon nuclear power complex . <p> * Withdrawing from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty , which Kim 's father had signed . <p> * Threatening to resume testing ballistic missiles . North Korea suspended such tests in 1999 in exchange for the United States ' easing some trade restrictions . The year before , North Korea test fired a missile over Japan . The test proved its missiles had a longer range than previously thought and raised alarm in Tokyo and Washington . <p> All of these provocative moves have been accompanied by bellicose rhetoric from North Korea 's official press , including a vow to level the United States in " a sea of fire . " At the same time , the North Koreans insist they want a peaceful solution to the crisis and have made several overtures , including sending diplomats to New Mexico last weekend to meet with Gov . Bill Richardson , a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations . <p> The White House , meanwhile , has alternated between an uncompromising no-negotiations , no-rewards position and a suggestion that both assistance and " talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifting U.S. response appears to be a reaction to North Korea 's erratic diplomacy . <p> Guessing games <p> No one knows exactly what the secretive Kim Jong Il is up to . " It is a little mystifying , " U.S. Assistant Secretary of State James Kelly said here Monday . <p> Western diplomats call Pyongyang the world 's most paranoid regime . Hawks in Washington and Seoul fear that the North Korean dictator really does want nuclear weapons to fend off threats , real and imagined , from the United States . <p> Among the South Korean public , there is a feeling that Kim is using the nuclear threat to squeeze economic aid from the United States and South Korea , as his father did during a similar standoff in 1994 . <p> Still others say Kim Jong Il was shaken when President Bush abandoned the Clinton administration 's attempts at engagement and lumped North Korea into an " axis of evil " along with Iran and Iraq . <p> Those who espouse this theory say Kim is genuinely terrified that the United States will attack his country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he simply wants assurances that the United States will not attack or do anything to destabilize his regime , which has been isolated and impoverished since the collapse of the Soviet Union . <p> " They are no longer using the nuclear card for economic benefits , " says Cheong Seong Chang , a North Korea watcher at the Sejong Institute , a Seoul think tank . " They are using it for the survival of the regime . " <p> For Kim Jong Il , confrontation is nothing new . His biography is a disturbing mix of the Brothers Grimm and Caligula , complete with tales of a divine birth , a wicked stepmother and Bacchanalian excess in a land racked by famine . <p> North Korean hagiography insists he was born on sacred Mount Paektu in an event marked by the auspicious appearance of a double rainbow . He actually was born in a military camp in Soviet Siberia , where his father , then a communist guerrilla leader , was hiding from the Japanese occupying Korea during World War II . <p> Kim Jong Il 's mother died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been desperate to ingratiate himself with his father . As a young man , he taste-tested his father 's food for poison . <p> Kim Jong Il won favor in 1967 when he helped purge veteran communists who resisted Kim Il Sung 's efforts to create his own cult of personality . The son 's loyalty helped him fend off a challenge from his conniving stepmother , who was trying to maneuver her own son to the throne . His vanquished stepbrother now serves as the country 's ambassador to Poland . He is n't allowed to come home to North Korea . <p> For years , Kim Jong Il kept a low profile . North Korea 's government-controlled media referred to a mysterious " party center " known for his wisdom but rarely mentioned him by name . Some North Koreans concluded that their leader 's heir had a speech impediment or a birth defect . Then , in 1980 , he was formally named next in line to succeed his father , setting up the first dynastic succession in a communist regime . He was known as Dear Leader @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assumed Kim Il Sung 's title of " Great Leader . " <p> Experts assumed the son would fail , perhaps toppled by ambitious generals . North Korea was sliding into poverty and famine , its economic lifeline cut after the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 . The new regime was expected to crumble . But Kim Jong Il had quietly spent the 1970s and 1980s putting loyalists in top positions . <p> " He was able to get rid of all his competitors , " says Chon of the Korea Institute for National Unification . He co-opted the military brass with a " military-first " policy that has given men in uniform first claim on the country 's meager resources . <p> Kim , 60 , looks pasty and pudgy but is in surprisingly good shape . Former bodyguard Lee says the dictator would spend two hours going up and down staircases specially built for his workouts , as aides scrambled to keep up . <p> As unquestioned leader , Kim has lived a life of comfort and excess as his people boiled grass for food . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of famine from 1994 to 1997 . Even now , 70% of the country 's children are malnourished , says the Korean Welfare Foundation , a private aid group in Seoul . Kim is reported to be among the world 's biggest consumers of Hennessy cognac . But he prefers Paekdu Mountain Eternal Youth rice liquor and can down half a bottle in one gulp . <p> His regime reportedly spent $ 20 million on 200 Mercedes S-class sedans in 1998 . That 's equivalent to a fifth of the aid the U.N . had pledged to North Korea that year . Kim is said to have stashed the earnings from a private gold mine in Swiss bank accounts and bought villas across Europe . <p> Kim is a legendary womanizer . But Lee dismisses as " nonsense " reports that female " pleasure squads " were trained to service him . Kim was , however , followed everywhere by a pretty young nurse better at dispensing charming banter than medical advice . <p> He reportedly has a film library with more than 10,000 titles , mostly from Hollywood and Hong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 13th and action films such as Rambo . His favorite film stars are Elizabeth Taylor and Sean Connery , reports Choi Eun Hee , a South Korean actress who was kidnapped in 1978 with her director husband in Kim 's bizarre scheme to start a North Korean film industry . <p> " The kidnapping was very personal , " Choi says . " He loves films . " <p> Over 2 ? years , the couple made 21 movies , each of which was edited by Kim Jong Il . Choi , who escaped with her husband in 1986 and is starting a film school in South Korea , says Kim was a passionate but uneven filmmaker . <p> Violent schemes <p> Some of Kim 's schemes have been lethal . He is widely believed to have been behind a bombing in 1983 that killed 17 top-level South Korean officials visiting Burma and the downing of a South Korean airliner in 1987 that killed 115 people . <p> But his image got a makeover in June 2000 when he held a historic summit with South Korean President Kim Dae Jung in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the airport and played the gracious host , cracking jokes and impressing observers with his knowledge of the outside world ( he 's an enthusiastic Web surfer and CNN watcher ) . <p> He also won praise for unveiling a plan last summer to overhaul North Korea 's impoverished economy . Under the plan , North Korea lifted unrealistic price controls on basic commodities such as rice and let them rise to black-market levels . It also raised wages dramatically and proposed a free-enterprise zone on the Chinese border . <p> Actress Choi says Kim Jong Il can be charming . The first time she met him , he tried to calm her with self-deprecating humor . The pudgy , 5-foot-3 strongman did a pirouette and said : " I look like a sack of dwarf 's droppings , do n't I ? " The unusual icebreaker worked in a way , Choi says : " I realized he was n't going to kill me . " <p> Even so , defectors such as Lee and others who have seen him up close say Kim Jong Il will never change . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world because his people will see how far they 've fallen behind and will demand answers  --  and perhaps a new government . <p> These defectors urge the United States and South Korea to take a hard line in dealing with the dictator . <p> " Kim Jong Il has no interest in his people , " Lee says . " If any negotiation threatens his regime , he will cancel it . The only interest he has in these negotiations is holding power .
