The news is about Jessica , our first grandchild ( have a cigar ; no , do n't ) , who was born on March 1 , just under 7 lbs . and 19 in. big . I hold her on the couch as she sleeps swaddled  --  part baby , part blanket  --  in the crook of my arm . Her harpist 's fingers twitch in independent dreams . The threads of blue veins above her barely visible eyebrows run like rivers on a map . It comes back to you , holding babies  --  the surprisingly substantial weight . <P> The news is also about Jessica literally , in that as she sleeps , the news is on TV . As I hold Jessica , 15-year-old Charles Andrew Williams sits in the back of a police car that is about to take him to a county juvenile facility for killing two fellow students in Santee , Calif . His skin looks smoother than a baby 's . <P> I casually realize that part of my grandfatherly duties will be to hold Jessica safe from the news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also need to be alert to the news . When she is old enough , I will inform her that I am in the news business  --  or on the soft edges of it  --  and she may ask what the news business is . I will tell her that it has to do with knowing and understanding what is going on in the world . <P> If she demands more , of course , I will be forced to let her know that I have never understood most of the news  --  not the child killings , the tribal slaughters , the religious wars , the categorical hatreds , the fate of the poor , the diseased , the driven from their homes . I have never understood the weather . Not that these deficiencies have stood in the way of my sonorous brayings about the nature of the universe . <P> You see , Jessica , the reason that America makes guns available to children is ... It 's this way , Jessica : Some people live in the slums , and others live on the hills , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market goes up and the market goes down , and the explanation is ... She is smiling now , an involuntary reflex . <P> Lest she laugh in my face , I should tell her that there are other kinds of news I do understand . The news of the heart 's surprises , for example . I should tell her about my brother , her granduncle , who last month upped and got married for the first time to a schoolteacher from Beijing . He spent an entire life alone , and then appears the thoroughly lovely Chao Mei , and presto change-o , a heart beats . I should tell Jessica about that . <P> And I should also tell her about the news of the obvious truth . That took me decades to learn . As a young writer , I was the dandiest , cleverest wit and wise guy  --  a cinch if one possesses the meager gifts . And then after witnessing enough pain and plain courage in the world , I simply reversed course and started writing about the life before my eyes . Eventually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obvious truths , lying in the open , begging to be repeated . <P> So I should also tell her about the news of the familiar , which is always strange . And the news of the routine and continuous , which is always shocking .
