Section : Snapshots HALL OF FAME SECOND ACTS <p> WITH REMARKABLE SPEED , MARK E. Hamister built National Health Care Affiliates Inc. , the business he founded in 1977 , into a powerhouse with 23 nursing homes and other geriatric facilities in five eastern states . The Buffalo-based company 's whirlwind growth propelled it onto the Inc. 500 list five times in the 1980s , earning it a spot in the Hall of Fame . In 1996 , at age 44 , Hamister decided to chill out . He sold all of the business , except two nursing homes and a then-budding provider of home-based health care , for $135 million . He also cut his work schedule to two hours a day . " I came into the office occasionally to putt , " he says . <p> Hamister had every reason to stick to golf : He had pots of money . He had proved himself beyond all doubt as an entrepreneur and a businessman . He had a dream house in the suburbs and plenty of time to spend with his three children . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says . <p> A life of leisure , however , did n't sustain Hamister for long . To combat his ennui , he did what came naturally . He started more companies : Premier Self Storage Inc. , Hamister Development Corp. , and Buffalo Sports Enterprises . As an irrepressible creator of companies , Hamister is hardly alone among his fellow CEOs at the 52 businesses that have achieved Hall of Fame status . At least 13 of those entrepreneurs have created brand-new companies , according to a recent Inc. survey . All told , the start-up repeaters have launched 32 new ventures . <p> Although Hamister 's record is remarkable , he 's not the undisputed second-act champ among the Hall of Fame founders . Grady Burrow , 65 , of Birmingham , Ala. , for example , attained Hall of Fame laurels in 1997 , when Designer Checks Inc. made the Inc. 500 for the fifth time . Also , another of Burrow 's companies , Maxus Construction Co. , made the list in 1996 . He has since sold both companies , but he says he 's angling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street Checks Inc. , which he estimates will do $1 million in sales this year . A provider of custom-designed checks for community banks , Main Street relies on the same laser check-printing technology that fueled the explosive growth of Designer Checks . <p> Not that Hamister is conceding anything , however . He 's been ramping up National Health Care Affiliates , a name he retained for the holding company that owns his current health-care properties . Now he operates three assisted-living residences in New York . His most profitable recent venture , he says , is Premier Self Storage , which rents out storage space at three facilities in the Buffalo area . The two-year-old business posted $2 million in revenues last year . <p> Then there 's Hamister Development , his real estate development arm , which has built shopping centers , among other projects . And he has plunged into a different world with Buffalo Sports Enterprises , the owner of the Buffalo Destroyers . The national football team , started in 1997 , competes in the Arena Football League , which is 13 years old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first step in a larger sports-franchise strategy . He envisions building a sports empire that includes big-league football and basketball teams . <p> Hamister 's multiple start-up strategy may seem capricious , if not willy-nilly , BUT HE SAYS THAT IT ISN'T. " i HAPPEN TO BE A STUDY FREAK , " HE SAYS . " I need to know what demographic I 'm trying to reach with a business , or I wo n't touch it . " For example , Hamister 's storage business , which offers space that customers fill on their own with household goods or other items , targets female heads of households . That 's a large and growing group , he says , that eschews self-storage facilities , which are often dirty and usually saddle customers with the job of hauling heavy objects like sofas . Hamister says his company is a stickler for neatness , and he teams up with local truck-rental companies to do the heavy lifting . <p> Similarly , in purchasing the Buffalo Destroyers , Hamister was aiming for a specific sports niche : families with small children . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hamister offers face painting , cotton candy , and inflatable fun houses . The company 's annual revenues have grown to $6 million , despite the team 's regular-season record to date of 6-22 . <p> MARK E. HAMISTER : ' I happen to be a study freak .
