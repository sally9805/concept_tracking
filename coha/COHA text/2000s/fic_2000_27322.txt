The ghostly trace of " NIGGER " on a message board hanging from Iliana 's door failed to assault her as it had the first time she returned to her dorm room to find it . Just a few more hours and she 'd be home . Already she breathed easier . She locked the door and mounted her suitcases on a cart her parents had let her keep after escorting her to Port Authority eighteen months earlier . Gripping the cart 's handle , she dragged it along the corridor and bounced it , one step at a time , down the wide staircase . On another day she would have stepped quietly . But on her departure from the dormitory whose high ceilings and pale arches reminded her of a museum , she took pleasure in letting her steps echo loudly through the morning silence . Depositing her keys in the Resident Assistant 's mail slot , she stepped out into the cold and under the grey and low-slung sky . That sky 's color was one of the reasons she was leaving . Its relentlessness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of its location five hours from New York Citya distance too great for her parents to visit her as often as they had her brother in Albany . The campus was also reputedly one of the prettiest . From glossy photographs of the surrounding lakes and gorges , she had concluded that the university would be the ideal place to escape her parents ' watchful eyes . She had not anticipated that , when not collapsing with rain or snow , the sky would nevertheless remain the same threatening shade . She was also leaving because a voice had been waking her with news of what was taking place at home . The accounts had started several months earlier and , depending on the news , had lasted until dawn . It had gotten so that she rarely slept . As soon as her head touched her pillow , the disembodied voice crept close . Upon hearing it for the first time , her eyes had flashed open , her heart had slammed against her ribs . Had n't her father warned her ? " Mi'ja , " he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board the Greyhound bus and continuing in Spanish , the only language he and Aurelia spoke . " Find a church . There must be one around there . Do n't let what happened to your sister Nereida happen to you too . " " I 'll keep in touch , " was all her mother had said . Hugging both , Iliana had assured them that she would remain faithful . " Seven spirits , " Papito had added urgently . " Seven evil spirits at your side if you should stray from God . Remember ! " In the single room she had considered herself lucky to obtain , Iliana had remembered . Not only had she neglected waking early to catch the bus to the Seventh-Day Adventist church in town , she had also gone to the local bar and , for the first time ever , to the cinema , where Satan preyed on souls . " Get thee behind me , Satan , " she had commanded the voice , relying , without conviction , on the exhortation she had been taught repelled evil spirits . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was her mother'sauthoritative but hinting mischief as when she had taught her to dance merengue on a Sabbath morning while the rest of the family attended church . Hands trembling , Iliana stumbled out of bed to dial her parents ' number . " Iliana Maria ? " Aurelia asked , instantly identifying her daughter 's silence . Iliana slammed down the receiver . " Do n't be afraid , mi'ja , " the voice said , defying the distance Iliana had deliberately placed between herself and her mother . " The devil exists , but it 's not me . " Shivers unraveled along Iliana 's spine . She willed the voice to go away , but it persisted , hounding her as her mother 's had at home . It spoke of her brother Emanuel 's visit from Seattle ; of the two eldest , Mauricio and Chaco , who , with their families , had moved back to the Dominican Republic ; of the dream that had inspired Nereida to be rebaptized after an absence of years from church , of the flowers in their Brooklyn yard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached past Papito 's head . " The Lord is my light and my salvation . Whom shall I fear ? " Iliana recited , her voice scraping against her suddenly dry throat so that it sounded barely above a whisper . " The Lord is the strength of my life . " Her dilated eyes searched the darkened room . " Of whom shall I be afraid ? " Faintly , so that she strained to hear it , the voice returned . " Forgive , mi'ja . I did n't think you 'd be afraid . You know we ca n't speak much on the phone . It 's too expensive . Your father would be angry . " Cowering beside her bed , Iliana recalled her mother 's ears . Those ears , with holes pierced during a past Aurelia rarely spoke of , had both frightened and intrigued her . Raised in a religion which condemned as pagan the piercing of body parts , she had imagined that , were her mother 's clogged holes pried open , she would transform into a sorceress dancing , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ illness , but freely , unleashing impulses Papito 's religion had suppressed . This image had sharpened whenever Aurelia had undone the braids wound tightly around her head . At such moments , before Iliana 's intruding eyes caused her to braid the cascading locks into submission , she had smiled at her own reflection shifting from an aging matriarch 's to that of a young girl 's with hoops dangling from her ears . This memory evoked others to which Iliana had previously attached no significance : Aurelia waking restlessly before dawn to scrub clean floors ; Aurelia wringing sheets dry with a strength that defied exhaustion ; and Aurelia slicing onions , a sharpened knife blurring dangerously toward her thumb at a speed which would have resulted in the loss of a finger had anyone else attempted it . This incessant activity , even at moments when she might have opted to relax , now suggested an effort to contain forces struggling to escape . Initially the visitations had occurred sporadically . But as the racial slurs began appearing on Iliana 's door , they increased in frequency . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the voice was in fact her mother 's . When she called home , Aurelia began conversations where the voice had left off the previous night . If asked about events never discussed on the phone , she responded without hesitation . Everything Iliana had been brought up to believe denounced the voice as evil . Yet her instincts persuaded her it was n't so . On nights when the radiator in her room gave off little warmth , the voice transported her to a Dominican Republic where summer days were eternal , clouds evaporated in the scorching heat , and palm trees arched along beaches of fiery sand . It spoke of her birth immediately following her grandmother 's death ; of how she should have been a boy since her sex had been predicted from the shape of Aurelia 's pointy stomach and all her siblings had been born to form alternate pairs of the same sex , a sequence only Iliana had disrupted ; of how , although Mauricio and Chaco , Rebecca and Zoraida , Caleb and Emanuel , Nereida and Azucena , Vicente and Gabriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apart , she herself had refused to come until three years after Beatriz and three before Tico , the youngest child . There , in the attic room of the university whose hilltop location contrived to make her forget the rest of the world and whose courses disclaimed life as she had known it , making her feel invisible , the voice reassured Iliana of her own existence and kept her rooted . She learned that during her absence both her parents had been diagnosed as having alarmingly high blood pressure and that Papito , afraid of dying , had resorted to taking his and his wife 's prescribed pills while she refused her own ; that Rebecca 's accounts of Pasin 's abuses had caused Aurelia 's heart attack ; that Marina , wishing to have her future told , had visited an astrologer later to claim that he had raped her ; that Beatriz had left home and not been heard of since ; that Vicente had dropped out of graduate school and his wife had packed her things and left him ; that Tico rarely left his room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throughout their first two years of marriage and Gabriel , during one of his frequent , short-lived spurts of religious fervor , had confessed to the pastor and then to Caleb of his adulterous affair with Linda , Caleb 's common-law wife ; that Caleb had turned his gun in to his parents ' custody for fear of killing his own brother ; and that Marina had suffered a nervous breakdown . It was these events , more than her disappointment with the university , which had convinced Iliana to leave school . She avoided the icy path leading from her dormitory and cut across the lawn . Brittle grass crunched beneath her feet as she headed toward a cluster of buildings on North Campus . Except for a few other students , the campus was desolate . It was at such moments that she enjoyed it most . She was able to walk , unashamed of the stride that had caused her grief since childhood and that she had tried her damnedest to change since then . But , no matter what , her hips thrust forward and swayed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as regal , her sisters as whorish . And it was they whom Iliana tended to believe . Wanting to appear confident , she had taken to walking with her head held high and her eyes staring straight ahead . This , combined with shyness , had gotten her labeled an arrogant bitch . Whenever she had attended parties , even those sponsored by minority organizations , she had never been asked to dance And when she had attended with Ed , rumors had spread that she dated only white men . If the rumors had n't hurt so much , Iliana would have laughed . Not only had no oneblack , white , yellow , or redever asked her out , Ed was Mexican and preferred to sleep with men . She climbed the steps to his dormitory and called him from the courtesy phone . It seemed to ring interminably before his roommate answered . " David , is Ed there ? " " Holy shit ! What time is it ? " " It 's almost seven-thirty . We 're supposed to catch the bus at eight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Ed , get up ! Iliana 's on the phone ! Ed ! I 'm not telling you again ! " Minutes elapsed before he returned to the phone . " I 'll let you in on my way out , " he said , clicking off before Iliana was able to respond . She stamped her feet in an attempt to keep them warm . Just as she was about to redial , David flew past her , barely letting her catch the door . " I ca n't talk . I have an exam at eight and fell asleep at my desk . " " Well , goodbye to you too , " Iliana said . He whirled around and hurried back to her . Smiling sheepishly , he gave her a hug and kissed her cheek . " I 'm sorry . I forgot . You 're not coming back , are you ? " He released her and ran off , slipping on a patch of ice . " Maybe you 'll change your mind , " he yelled . " Home is never fun . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his green hair blowing like a tuft of grass . Not long ago , he had asked her to bleach his hair and dye it blue . The peroxide he had insisted she leave on longer than the required time had left his scalp lined with welts and his dark hair a yellow that had turned green with the bright-blue dye . She would miss him , crazy though he was . Iliana pulled the cart into the dormitory and stepped into the waiting elevator . From the lounge on the third floor , she saw Ed 's door ajar and his body still in bed . " Shit , Ed . Ca n't you ever get up on time ? " He peered at her through slitted eyes . " What time is it ? " " There 's a clock right beside you . " " Oojale , what 's gotten into you this morning ? " " What 's gotten into me ? You ! It 's seven-thirty and you 're in bed ! " " Will you relax ? It 'll only take me a few minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the early bus ? Who insisted I make it here on time ? " " Ay mujer ! Ya ! " The authoritativeness of Ed 's voice jarred Iliana into silence . Maybe he was right . Maybe she was overreacting . So what if she had spent most of the night packing and had woken early at his insistence ? What was the use of clinging to anger because he had accidentally overslept ? She watched him clamber out of bed . As he strolled past her toward the communal baths , he beamed her an impish grin . Its patronizing curve affected her like burrs prickling her skin . It dawned on her then that , should he have been the one to be kept waiting , he would have had a fit . Yet with his " Ay mujer ! " he had effectively dismissed her anger . Worse , he knew how she hated those two words , how they reminded her of her father 's " Mira , muchacha ! " As clearly as if it had occurred the previous day , she recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papito . He had just purchased a box of soaps for her mother and had proudly held one out for her to inspect . " Ummm " she 'd said , flattered that he was showing her the gift before presenting it to Aurelia . " It smells like cinnamon . " " Mira , muchacha ! Do n't you see the strawberries on the wrapper ? " Iliana took the soap from his hand and moved it closer to her nose . " I know , papi , but it smells like cinnamon " Papito snatched the soap from her hand and raised it to his own nose . " Strawberries " he insisted . " Strawberries ! " " Strawberries are n't spicy . " " What are you saying , that I waste my money buying garbage ? " " Maybe someone mislabeled them " Iliana said . " How were you supposed to know ? And the cinnamon is n't bad . " Papito jerked her head closer to the soap . " Strawberries ! This is a strawberry-scented soap ! " Iliana again sniffed the soap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it smells like cinnamon . " Before she knew what was happening , her father 's callused hand had slapped her face . " Muchacha de la porra ! Admit it ! It smells like strawberries ! " Cinnamon , Iliana mumbled . " What does it smell like ? " Iliana defiantly braced herself for another blow . " Cinnamon ! " The back of Papito 's hand again flew toward her face . Determined not to cry or cringe , Iliana held her ground . " It smells like cinnamon ! Why ask if you do n't want to know ? " Her father unhooked his belt and drew it from the loops around his pants . " Sinvergenza ! I 'll teach you to disrespect me ! " " Cinnamon " Iliana had shouted , blocking out the sound of the belt whizzing toward her legs and glaring at her father with all the contempt that she could muster . " Cinnamon , cinnamon " she had chanted , her legs stinging and welts rising as the leather strap landed repeatedly on her thighs . " It smells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coat and plopped down onto David 's bed . Here it was a year and a half since she 'd left home and still certain words triggered self-doubt and left her mute , still she feared the consequences of asserting herself . Her eyes strayed to her suitcases waiting by the door . When packing , she had reluctantly given away the items she dared not take home with her : skirts which , though just above her knees , would have just been judged indecent ; flat shoes , all except for the boots on her feet , for which she would have been called matronly by sisters who already considered her an old maid ; clip-on earrings she had secretly begun to wear ; and all her books , including those required for courses and others she had read voraciously without fear of her father 's throwing them away . Only now did she realize the implications of her decision to go home . Throughout all her planning she had mostly thought of taking her family by surprise . She had not stopped to consider that by returning she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to live according to her father 's dictates , she would also have to join him in Bible study , attend church on Saturdays , and listen to his sermons if her face but revealed an expression interpreted as defiant . Should she neglect any of these matters , her name would be brought up for prayer before the congregation . Even now , remembering the first time its prayers were solicited in her behalf , Iliana 's conscience pricked with guilt . She had been only seven and had decided that she did not want to go to school . Knowing that if she postponed being sick until morning her mother would suspect she was faking , she had moaned and tossed in bed during the night . One of her sisters notified their mother . Alarmed when Iliana unwittingly pointed to the location of her appendix as the area where it hurt , Aurelia woke Papito . The two of them knelt beside Iliana and , with hands joined at her side , prayed that God too might place His hand on her to heal her . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see a doctor . Terrified that her lie would be discovered and already imagining the sting of her father 's belt , Iliana developed a fever . By the time they arrived at the clinic she appeared to be in so much pain and was perspiring so heavily that the doctor , after a cursory examination , decided that she indeed had appendicitis . Fearing that her appendix would burst before an ambulance arrived , he drove mother and daughter to a hospital himself . As they drove across the Williamsburg Bridge , the sight of Manhattana city Papito had often compared to Sodom and Gomorrahincreased Iliana 's fear . Although she had not fully understood what he 'd meant when he 'd said men on that island slept with other men and women with women ( had n't she herself slept with her sisters ? ) , she had concluded that Manhattan too would be destroyed . So real to her was the possibility of being caught in that hell and burning with other sinners that she began to cry . The doctor , lips stretching into a line more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the front seat . " You need to be brave , " he said . " You 're a big girl now . " Then , switching from broken Spanish to English as if confiding a secret he preferred Aurelia not to understand , he added , " It 'll be just like a vacation . You wo n't have to go to school . You 'll even get to watch as much TV as you want and eat in bed . That 's not so bad , is it ? " His intimate tone convinced Iliana that he knew she had lied and was only taunting her . She mistrusted his eyes , icy blue and dull like metal , which , lacking depth , made him appear to have no soul . Looking at him , his hair shimmering golden in the sunlight slanting through the car window , she believed he was Satan 's angel sent to take her off to hell . " Do n't let him take me , mami " she sobbed . " Please do n't let him take me . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sssh . Do n't cry . Everything 's going to be okay , " Aurelia said , gently squeezing the hand she had held since dragging Iliana , kicking and screaming , into the back seat . Iliana was hospitalized for four days throughout which family and church members prayed for her recovery . After the fourth day , the doctors , finding no symptoms of appendicitis , released her to her parents . Convinced that God had performed a miracle in her behalf , Papito donated flowers to the church every Saturday until the one-year anniversary of her recovery . Worse , the pastor forevermore portrayed her as a living example of God 's care toward those who believed in Him in a modern , wicked age . Remembering , Iliana wondered that her lie had never been detected . Either she was a magnificent actress or her parents had been determined to teach her a lesson she would not forget . She tended to believe the former . But if the second was the truth , the lesson learned had not been the one intended . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discovered that authorities , as personified by her parents , the doctors and the pastor , were not as knowledgeable as she 'd believed . Furthermore , because throughout the years her father had silenced any questions that challenged life as he perceived it , she had learned to agree with everything he said while secretly composing answers of her own . Only by leaving home had she , on occasion , acquired the confidence to express her opinion , and she feared that by returning she would fall silent once again . " That did n't take too long , did it ? " Iliana barely turned toward Ed . " Listen , I have an idea , " he said . " Why do n't you stay with me before going to your parents ' house ? They 're not expecting you , and I 've got Susan 's apartment to myself for the entire month " Iliana silently shook her head . " Why not ? It 'll give you a chance to adjust to being back . " " Ed , I ca n't . I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . " " I thought you said they all lived in Brooklyn " " Most of them do , but several work in Manhattan and they 'd be quick to jump to conclusions if they caught me out with you . " " Oh , come on . It 'd be so much fun . We could go to museums and galleries , then hit the clubs at night . It 's a big city . What are the chances of running into them ? " The resentment Iliana had been harboring toward Ed surfaced as she left him to stand before a window . He behaved as if each moment were his to enjoy without guilt or fear of consequence . In contrast , she snatched what little pleasure she could from an ever-watchful God . Each time she allowed music to sway her body , went to the cinema or even had a sip of coffee , she was hounded by the idea that she risked her eternal soul . It did n't matter that she had long since stopped believing in God , or at least in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God 's judgments nevertheless preyed on her fears . Each night , before drifting into sleep , she reluctantly knelt beside her bed to plead for her soul should He in fact exist . " You do n't understand , Ed . I 'd be so paranoid that I would n't have any fun . Besides , I 'm already nervous enough about going back without setting myself up for trouble " " You 're not having second thoughts , are you ? " Iliana stared glumly out of the window . She trailed a finger along the dusty sill , then rubbed the dirt onto the glass . " You okay ? " " I just have a premonition , that 's all . " " About what ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I just think I 'm fooling myself . I meanI 've come to hate this place so much that I 've convinced myself I should take a year off and help with all the shit going on at home . I 've even flattered myself by thinking I 'll be welcomed with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were never one big , happy family to begin with . " " Do n't go , then , " Ed said matter-of-factly . Iliana whirled around to face him . " Hell is breaking loose at home ! How the fuck am I supposed to stay and pretend everything 's okay ? " Surprise elongated Ed 's already narrow face . " I 'm sorry . I was n't trying to tell you what to do . I only thought " His apologetic tone deflated Iliana 's anger . Shoulders hunched , she slid under the window and let fall the tears that , years earlier and in defiance of her father 's beatings , she had vowed to suppress at whatever cost . " Are you sure you do n't want to stay with me ? " Ed asked , attempting to draw her near , only to have her raise a hand to stop him . " At least for a couple of days ? " Iliana wiped the tears she had n't wanted him to see . " Waiting is n't going to make it any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else to do or say . " I 'm okay , " Iliana mumbled . " You know I always am.
