<p> The rape victim was in tatters . Ropes and scarves the rapist had used as binding dangled from her body as the Atlanta woman fled her East Lake bungalow for a neighbor 's house . <p> She told how he grabbed her throat , pulled a hood over her head and delivered an ultimatum : Be silent or die . <p> Afterward , her fear was so gripping that she never spent another night in the house where she was raped . <p> There should have been some relief four months later , when DNA evidence led to the arrest of a suspect . <p> Instead , police delivered news that amplified the senselessness of it all : The suspect would have been behind bars May 6 , 2003 , the night of the rape , if not for a law enforcement foul-up . <p> Billy Joe Wilson , 39 , an armed robber , drug dealer and suspect in an earlier rape , was free because of a bungled October 2002 telephone call between Clayton County 's two law enforcement agencies  --  the Sheriff 's Department @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' failure to communicate on evidence from a June 2 , 2001 , rape in Clayton County allowed Wilson to remain free . <p> The two departments agree on when things went wrong , but not who is to blame . In an effort to put the dispute to rest , one of the central figures even took a lie-detector test . <p> But questions about what happened remain unanswered because of incomplete Sheriff 's Department records . <p> The sheriff 's crime scene unit was supposed to have called the police detectives squad Oct. 10 , 2002 , with the news that DNA evidence made Wilson the suspect in the 2001 rape in Clayton County . If police had acted on the evidence and arrested Wilson in 2002 , he would have been behind bars the night of the 2003 Atlanta rape . <p> But police say they never received the message . <p> The sheriff 's deputy who insists he made the call , Sgt. Fred Lewis , says he can not remember who answered the phone at the police detectives division . Lewis failed to record the person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuggle said he stands by Lewis ' assertion that he made the call . Tuggle said he " counseled " the deputy for his failure to log the police contact 's name . <p> At the core of the mix-up is a longtime partnership between Clayton 's police detectives and the sheriff 's forensics unit . For as long asofficials can remember , the police and Sheriff 's Department have double-teamed on major crime scenes : The police supply the detectives ; the sheriff employs the forensic crime scene unit . <p> Clayton police , who have never had a forensic unit , must call for the sheriff 's crime scene experts whenever the investigation requires a collection of fingerprints , hair , fiber or DNA . <p> The arrangement is unusual : Most countywide police departments in metro Atlanta have their own crime scene departments , keeping the investigation under one command . <p> The Clayton system requires a three-agency handoff when GBI lab work is involved : <p> * First , police detectives investigate . <p> * Next , sheriff 's technicians collect evidence . <p> * Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the process works in reverse , requiring the GBI to call the Sheriff 's Department , which contacts the police detective squad . The GBI never calls Clayton police directly because the bureau 's policy requires delivering lab results only to the " requesting agency . " <p> Dave Camp , who teaches criminal justice at Georgia State University , calls the arrangement risky , comparing it to a triple reverse in football . <p> " The more hands that touch it , there 's a better chance someone will drop the ball , " he said . <p> Wilson eventually admitted committing the first rape and was sentenced last October to 12 years in prison when his victim declined to testify against him . He faces arraignment Feb. 18 in DeKalb Superior Court in the Atlanta rape . <p> The victim in that rape has moved and could not be found for comment in this article . <p> The phone call in question was made  --  or not  --  16 months after the Clayton rape and seven months before the Atlanta assault . <p> Lewis , a crime scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important information : DNA tests linked Wilson to the Clayton rape , in which a woman was stalked and tied with a karate belt . <p> The genetic match was a big break in the case , which had been " cold " for more than a year . <p> But no one at the Police Department remembers hearing from Lewis that day , said Clayton Police Chief Darrell Partain . It is inconceivable that any police officer or even a receptionist would forget such a conversation or fail to act on it , Partain said , since it was the key to solving a case that had stumped investigators . <p> Finding Wilson to file rape charges would have been no problem . He was in a state prison in Monroe County , serving a sentence for selling cocaine . <p> In most of the entries in the Sheriff 's Department 's log on the case , various deputies spell out in capital letters the names of those who provided information . <p> An example is the Oct. 10 , 2002 , note on how GBI Crime Lab manager Lynn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rape . <p> " LYNN FYFFE from the State Crime Lab call to advise that the rape kit results matched to a WILSON , BILLY JOE . . . who was in the state data base computer . " <p> Lewis ' entry on how he relayed the information to the county police Criminal Investigations Division was dated Oct. 1 , 2002 . That would have been impossible because the GBI did not relay its information to Lewis until Oct. 10 . Sheriff Tuggle said the wrong date was a typographical error , that Lewis called the police the same day he heard from the GBI . <p> But the sheriff admits that Lewis did not record who answered his call at the Police Department . Lewis ' entry : " Contacted Clayton County Police Dept CI section and advised them of the information from the State Crime Lab . " <p> Lewis has been instructed by his superiors not to discuss the case . The sheriff said the deputy is telling the truth . <p> " There is no doubt he made the phone call to them , " Tuggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a name of his contact at the Police Department , I kind of counseled him on that . I have no reason not to believe Sergeant Lewis . " <p> Tuggle said his counseling of Lewis was the only action taken against an employee in the case . <p> After the Sheriff 's Department began receiving press inquiries about the case , Tuggle arranged for Lewis to take a polygraph test , administered by a GBI examiner last Sept. 25 . <p> The examiner concluded that Lewis did not appear to be deceptive on answers to questions about his report a year earlier , including the question : " Are you lying when you said you called the Clayton P.D . with the rape kit results ? " <p> Last week , Tuggle challenged police to take their own polygraph tests , saying police " do n't want to admit a mistake . " <p> " Polygraph who ? " Partain responded . " The whole CID Division ? " There are 32 detectives in the Criminal Investigations Division . <p> Last Aug. 28 , the GBI crime lab was analyzing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized it matched Wilson 's DNA . <p> The GBI keeps DNA files on every imprisoned felon in Georgia , so investigators looked up Wilson in their files . <p> They realized it was n't Wilson 's first match to a rape victim . <p> " Our DNA guy wondered why he was out , why he was n't charged with the first rape , " GBI spokesman John Bankhead said . <p> The next week , Clayton detective Chris Butler learned of the DNA match , 11 months after Lewis says he made the call . <p> " It was a shock to us , " Butler said . <p> Authorities found Wilson in the Bibb County Jail on charges unrelated to either rape . <p> As a result of the Wilson case , the Sheriff 's Department adopted a procedure last year requiring that forensic findings be sent in writing to the assigned police detective and the CID commander . <p> " We need to make sure it never happens again , so that we do n't have any more victims because phone messages get left for 11 months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crescent Sexual Assault Center . <p> * June 2 , 2001 : A Clayton County woman is stalked , tied up and raped in her Morrow apartment . <p> * June 19 , 2001 : Clayton County Sheriff 's Department sends rape evidence , taken at the emergency room , to the GBI . <p> * July 23 , 2001 : Making no progress , Clayton police detectives declare the case suspended for lack of leads . <p> * June 4 , 2002 : In an unrelated case , Billy Joe Wilson is sentenced in DeKalb County to prison for sale and distribution of cocaine . <p> * Oct. 10 , 2002 : Clayton County Sheriff 's Sgt.
