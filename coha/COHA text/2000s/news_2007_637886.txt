<p> The question we 're all asking is : What happened to Harry ? <p> No , we 're not wondering if it 's Harry Potter or Voldemort who perishes in J.K. Rowling 's seventh book , but rather why has the name " Harry " disappeared from major-league rosters ? <p> According to Lee Sinins ' Baseball Encyclopedia , there have been 167 players with the first name Harry who played big-league baseball , but just two of them  --  Harry Spilman and Harry Chappas  --  played into the 1980s and none since then . And if you 're thinking what about Harold Reynolds and Harold Baines , they do n't count . <p> The Harry heyday was the turn of the 20th century and earlier ; some of the game 's first stars were given that regal handle . In honor of the great Potter , here 's our take on the major leagues ' Best of the Harrys :  --  Catcher  --  Harry Danning . One of the Giants ' best catchers of all time , he played 10 seasons ( 1933-42 ) and was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , including .313 with 16 homers in 1939.  --  First base  --  Harry Davis . Early 20th century A 's star , he was the Barry Bonds of his day , leading the AL in homers four years in a row ( 1904-07 ) , but never hit more than 12 in any one season .  --  Second base  --  Harry Niles . It 's slim pickings for middle infielders named Harry , but we found this slugger ( third in AL with five HRs in 1908 ) . Best season was with 1907 Browns , where he hit .289 in 120 games .  --  Shortstop  --  Chappas . Was a backup for the White Sox from 1978-80 , with one homer and 12 RBIs in 184 at-bats.  --  Third base  --  Harry Steinfeldt . The other guy in the Cubs ' famous **25;3778;TOOLONG infield , Steinfeldt had a solid career with the Reds and Cubs , hitting .267 and leading the NL in hits and RBIs in 1906 . He helped the Cubs win their last two titles , hitting a combined .364 ( 12-for-33 ) in the 1907 and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Harry Hooper and Harry " Suitcase " Simpson . <p> Heilman ( .342 ) , a Hall of Famer , hit .403 for the ' 23 Tigers . <p> Hooper , also a Hall of Famer , was a St. Mary 's grad who played on four Red Sox World Series teams ( 1912 , ' 15 , ' 16 and ' 18 ) . He was one of the best contact and leadoff hitters of his day , scoring 100 runs three times . <p> Simpson earned the nickname by playing for 17 teams ( including minor-league teams ) in 11 years . Known for excellent defense , his best season was 1956 , when he batted .293 with 21 HRs and 105 RBIs for the A's.  --  Pitchers  --  Harry Brecheen ( first left-hander to win three games in one World Series , 1946 ) , Harry Gumbert ( 18-game winner for the ' 39 Giants ) , Harry Staley ( four-time 20-game winner in 19th century ) and Harry Howell ( seventh on Browns ' all-time win list ) .  --  Pinch-hitter  --  Spilman . The ex-Giant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Game 3 of the 1987 LCS against St. Louis .  --  Manager  --  Harry Craft ( Kansas City A 's , Cubs and Colt .45s ) .  --  Home-plate umpire  --  Harry Wendelstedt.  --  Announcers  --  Harry Kalas and Harry Caray . <p> One and done : On Monday and Tuesday , the Tigers clipped the Twins by identical 1-0 scores . It was the first time the Tigers had won consecutive 1-0 games since the Jerry Lumpe and Don Wert days of May 28-29 , 1965 , when they beat the Indians . Back in ' 65 , Hank Aguirre and Mickey Lolich each pitched two-hitters , Lolich 's was a 10-inning job . <p> Top 40 hits : The Dodgers and Phillies combined for 40 hits Tuesday , including 26 for the Phillies . Only twice before in L.A. history had the Dodgers and their opponents combined for at least 40 . The last was July 14 , 1997 , when L.A. had 22 and Colorado 18 . The L.A. record is 41 on May 24 , 1973 , when the Dodgers won 7-3 in 22 innings at Shea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Pitcher of steal : Orlando Hernandez stole a base in consecutive starts ( July 12 and 17 ) , becoming the first pitcher to do so in more than 40 years . According to the Mets , it was another Mets pitcher , Tom Seaver , on May 17 and 22 , 1967 , who was the last to do it . Hernandez stole his off Cincinnati 's Bronson Arroyo and San Diego 's Jake Peavy . Seaver got his against the Dodgers ' Bill Singer and Atlanta 's Phil Niekro . <p> Hernandez also is only the fourth pitcher age 41 or older to steal a base in big-league history . He joins 42-year-old Cy Young ( 1909 Indians ) , 41-year-old Curt Davis ( 1945 Dodgers ) and 41-year-old Jim Kaat ( 1980 Cardinals ) . <p> Phun with the Phils : The Phillies lost their 10,000th game last Sunday , becoming the first major-league team to reach the five-figure mark in losses . ESPN points out that the Phillies have seven of the NL 's 12 worst single-season records since 1900 . Their worst record was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Whether or not you think Red Sox right-hander Daisuke Matsuzaka should be considered a rookie ( he pitched six seasons for the Japan league 's Seibu Lions ) , he is one according to major-league baseball . He is 11-6 , and the last Red Sox rookie to have more than 11 wins for Boston was Mike Nagy who went 12-2 in 1969 . <p> Trivia answer : Tony Armas hit .218 for the 1983 Red Sox and drove in 107 runs . <p>  --  TRIVIA QUESTION / Andruw Jones is hitting .216 for the Braves yet is on pace to drive in more than 100 runs . Who 's the only player to hit under .230 and collect 100 RBIs in a season ? <p> CHART : <p> Do n't call him Barry Jason Kendall needed nearly 500 at-bats per home run during his three seasons with the A 's .
