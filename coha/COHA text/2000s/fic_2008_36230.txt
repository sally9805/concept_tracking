The Girl No One Knows <br> <br> <br> Fathers <br> <br> Mr. Dell , in his daughter 's room , stuck his face into the horn of a stargazer lily , one of a . . . one of a . . . must have been a dozen , and he breathed in and said was n't that something . And was n't it : the pileup of cards , a stuffed bear , a bouquet of balloons , a banner , a bed jacket , books on tape . <br> <br> We love you , Astra ! The chorus to his daughter was always the same , and he , too , said the same , but he did not look at her famished face , did not meet her eye , did not take her hand ; he wheezed out only so much cheer . " That party at the Mortons ' " was how he started . Mr. Dell stood between his daughter 's bed and the window and described what he could of the Mortons ' party . " I 've been to Suki @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , so other things , then . Not far into the kickoff fund-raiser , the host had stood on a piano bench to say he was not sorry to be so poorly acquainted with the parents gathered , but he expected to know a lot about everyone by the end of the school year when the money for the senior gift was raised . " Then Mr. Morton expected he would never see any of us again . " <br> <br> " That sounds like Suki 's dad . " <br> <br> " Suki 's mother is funny . " <br> <br> The room Suki 's father had spoken in was a very big , cream-colored box of a room , a cake box , a hatbox , something large and expensive . Mr. Dell described the party to his daughter in the way Grace would have described it : how things looked and sounded , the gurgle of civility among designing adults . He described what it felt like to be known as the parent of such a child , his own , his only , his best , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how are you feeling ? " he asked now . <br> <br> " Daddy , " Astra said , and she smiled when she told him how corny he was . <br> <br> He told his daughter who had come to the Mortons ' . Mrs. Forestal was there , so Mr. Forestal was not . Mr. and Mrs. Van de Ven , Mrs. Abiola , the Cohens , and Mr. Fratini were there . " I talked a lot to Alex 's mother  --  is that woman crazy ? The Johnsons were not in attendance . The headmistress , Miss Brigham , was there for a short speech , and she asked after you  --  everyone there asked after you , darling . Everyone sends love . " Then he remembered that the Johnsons were in Europe meeting somebody royal . <br> <br> Astra said , " The Johnsons have expensive fights that end with new jewels . " <br> <br> The Mortons ' apartment was all bloody mahogany and damask . Crystal chandeliers , those plinking rainbows , were hanging everywhere . Double sconces , elaborate molding , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The word expansive came to mind , or a three-tiered cake on a crystal stand , a monument in buttercream frosting , swags of sugar violets , silver dots . That was the equivalent dessert to the Mortons ' apartment as far as Mr. Dell was concerned . He looked at Astra again and saw how tired she was ; her eyelids looked swollen as if she had been crying , and perhaps she had cried . He had n't been here for all the tests ; he was at work . <br> <br> " I wish I could be hungry , " Astra said . She shut her eyes . <br> <br> Good night , ladies , good night , ta , ta , or however it went . Mr. Dell thought literature should be a consolation , but what he most often remembered did not comfort him . He did not have his wife 's gift , Astra 's inheritance from Grace for hope and serenity . Sick as his little girl was , she yet lay hopeful of recovery  --  fearful , too , at times , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and yet . . . she was sick and in pain on a sad floor in the hospital , and yet she seemed to feel his terror , his sorrow , and she consoled him by being mostly mild , sleepy , quiet . Most of the time when he visited , she slept and slept . She grew smaller . <br> <br> Again he asked and again , day after day , " How do you feel ? " <br> <br> Better . Not well . Sick . Hurting . Hurting a lot . Here is where it hurts the most . Look at what they did . <br> <br> Why was it hard to look when he had already looked into disaster , into the broken face of his beautiful wife in a bag on a gurney ? Yes , he remembered saying to the figures standing behind him  --  a row of janitors , a man with a mop at attention was that who ? Policemen ? Morticians ? Yes . My wife . This is Grace Walker Dell , yes . My wife . <br> <br> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour ? Why had she not been home , but she was saving money looking for a new lamp on Bowery . He wanted her here with him at this other , terrible bedside . He should not have to be alone . <br> <br> <br> <br> Mothers <br> <br> Theta Kovack called First Wok and ordered garlic chicken , noodles , soup . Two Cokes . Marlene , at her ear , said , " General Tsao 's ! Get General Tsao 's ! " But Theta said , " Are n't you on a diet ? " and she scuffed off her shoes and unbuttoned her blouse . The twenty she extracted from her purse felt damp . " For when the guy comes , " she said , holding out the money . She let her skirt slip down her hips as she walked to her room and shimmied out of work . Of course , she did n't want to see herself , but she saw herself , or parts of herself , her belly rucked by the band of her slip , an angry redness she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mortons ' party arrived wrongly dressed . Now the damp smell was surely hers , and nothing of Dr. Bickman 's office  --  the minty wintergreen of mouthwash , the cleansing alcohol , the doilies on the trays of tools  --  remained . A subway with a few stops and a three-block walk was all it had taken to grease Theta 's face . <br> <br> <br> A Daughter <br> <br> Miss Wilkes , undressing at home , sniffed the bitter smell at the underarms of her turtleneck and said , " My god ! " She sniffed again . When did her sweat turn so peculiarly acrid ? The face she saw in the mirror , her own , seemed still a girl 's , not a teacher 's , but the stink of her was something awful , old . True , the girls themselves were not always so fresh . Edie Cohen , in her usual rush , liked to announce she had n't showered . The girls said , " Keep your arms down . Stay away ! " But the girls got up close to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repelled by what they sometimes found . " Want an Altoid ? " Good girls mostly , polite , they offered her Skittles and mints , whatever they had secreted  --  and she allowed . Miss Wilkes said , " Yeah , I would like , " and she took her favorite colors . They got up close for her to pick and seemed startled at what they saw . What did they see ? But they were never so familiar as to fix her . They would let her go through a class smudged rather than say , " Miss Wilkes , you 've got ink on your chin . " Only Lisa Van de Ven had stopped her , had said , " Wait . " Lisa it was who had tucked in the label of her shirt , who had said , " Miss Wilkes , " holding out a box of Kleenex . Lisa Van de Ven , Lisa . Miss Wilkes was on the bed with the weight of her hand between her legs . <br> <br> <br> <br> Mothers <br> <br> In a corner apartment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with begonias , glossy begonias , Suki Morton 's mother held the phone in one hand and a drink in the other and heard her daughter 's screed against that fat Dr. Meltzer and his chem class labs . " He keeps us late . He piles on the homework . We 're seniors , for god 's sake . We 're under a lot of stress as it is . I hate Dr. Meltzer . " <br> <br> Mrs. Morton could not come up with an expression . Dr. Meltzer was a name attached to a fat man who smelled like the movies . Buttery and smoky at the same time . Butter-yellow teeth . Short-sleeved shirt , pocket protector , high waist , and waddle . Surely encountered in the movies but a teacher to be found in a public school , never one like Siddons . Mrs. Morton hung up the phone and said , " I never liked science . " <br> <br> <br> Ten blocks south , Suki 's best friend , Alex , was watching cheese melt over chips . She was talking to herself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved about this college was there were more boys than girls , better parties , good drugs . Alex was saying her ambition was to be the most famous party girl the school had ever known , and she knew what she was doing , and she could meet this goal . <br> <br> <br> Car Forestal twisted utensils through food she had mashed to look like war salvage , drought gruel , rancid scraps from boarding school . She was at the orphanage and eating with her baby " pusher , " the tiny silver spade from her godmother . Car pushed and smoothed and rearranged the food ; she made patterns . <br> <br> <br> Copyright 2008 by Christine Schutt <br> <br> All rights reserved .
