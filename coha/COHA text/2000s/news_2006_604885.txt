<p> ESCONDIDO , Calif.  --  Ladies and gentlemen , pleeeeease welcome , Mister Kevin Johnson ! <p> Polite applause washes across the small theater like a soft rain . A spotlight is tripped . Its blinding beam bounces off a few hundred white-haired heads until it reaches its target , a 35-year-old man who knows in his gut that he was born a few generations too late . Which is why his Wednesday night gigs are here , at the Lawrence Welk Resort . <p> " Hey there , folks ! " Johnson 's grin splits his boyish face . " So , I was 9 when I first heard voices ... " <p> Johnson is a ventriloquist . In fact , a right fine ventriloquist . Two years ago , an international theme park association named him best male park performer in the world . Yet in this age of insta-Idols and millionaire Survivors , he 's off the cultural radar . Or worse . <p> " Puppet boy , the guy with socks on his hands . Yeah , yeah , I hear it all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I ever wanted to do . " Johnson shrugs . " Maybe this is the year of change . " <p> Maybe . Johnson has come close , pitching a children 's show to cable featuring his alter egos , Matilda and Clyde , cockatoo and buzzard puppets who bicker like children while Johnson mediates . " But producers keep telling me the same thing : ' People will think it 's fake , that the voices are taped , so why do we need you ? ' " <p> That 's rich . Did the question come up when Edgar Bergen and his dummy , Charlie McCarthy , stormed radio ( think about that one ) in the 1930s ? And how about Shari Lewis and her Lamb Chop ? A 40-year streak of TV fame . <p> But these days , throwing your voice could mean tossing your talent away . Yet Johnson , puppets in hand , paddles upstream . Why ? <p> l <p> l <p> l <p> Mastering a craft can be a challenge , but get close , and it 's like a drug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erase the need for big paychecks or impressive titles . It 's just you and your muse . <p> " At a time when many of us work mostly because it pays , to find meaning in what you do can be a radical stance , " says Po Bronson , author of What Should I Do with My Life ? " Some job choices might seem out of step with the times , but the question is , does it provide fulfillment ? " <p> If the answer is yes , the price often is worth it . <p> Danielle Acerra had a nice thing going , using her college art degree at a wallpaper manufacturer where she helped brighten homes with her renditions of fruits , vines and other suitably subdued designs : " I felt , you know , that I 'd made it , " says Acerra , 29 , of Ocean Grove , N.J. <p> Until another voice in her head piped up , the one that wanted to unify communities with mural art in the spirit of the great Diego Rivera . So three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They do brighten public spaces , but much of their time is spent in nurseries and dens , cranking out visions of ducklings in ponds and revelers at the beach . <p> " Sometimes I think , ' I ca n't paint any more palm trees in this life ! ' " she says . Other career hazards include loud working conditions ( think mall restaurants ) and knee pain ( from squatting ) . " But I 'd be miserable doing anything else . " <p> l <p> l <p> l <p> Johnson was camouflaging his misery just before the Welk performance . Pre-show jitters . Every now and then , in a nervous tick sort of way , he 'd bark out a seal-like honnnnk followed by a whispered What-evah , the Blanche DuBois meets Valley Girl signature line of his " bird " Matilda . <p> But as soon as the laughs started flowing from the crowd  --  his crowd , folks who know who Bergen is !  --  he is determined to wow them . After all , Bergen had only one dummy . <p> First , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be topped by Matilda , who belts out a glass-shattering God Bless the USA . Thunderous applause . <p> In the lobby after the show , a couple wait for Johnson near a life-size cardboard cutout of Welk . " It 's a shame you do n't see more of this , it 's such good , clean entertainment , " says Marillyn Thomas , who has escaped the cold of Great Falls , Mont . " And this young man is so good . I mean , he could be on a cruise ship . " <p> Johnson has heard that grandmotherly advice before . The money would be good , but it would mean weeks away from his family . And though it 's a nice compliment , cruise entertainer is not his definition of The Big Time . " I think I 'd go a bit crazy on a boat , " he sighs . <p> With Matilda and Clyde in the back of his battered Saturn , Johnson drives a half-hour to his home in Vista , picking up Mexican food along the way . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Cody , 3 , want to hear about the show . It 's tough for wife Cherie , 29 , to get the two to bed . It does n't help that Dad , wired after his gig , keeps gabbing . <p> " I want to be on TV , " he says . <p> It 's a mantra , really . If he says it enough , maybe it will happen . He also knows he wants out of this place , a rental home that 's no more than 1,000 square feet in a dusty working-class neighborhood . <p> " I want more for my sons , and I know I can make it . But I do n't belong in this age . Now you have to do so much to impress people . My art , maybe it 's just too simple . " He sighs . " But I was born to do this . " <p> l <p> l <p> l <p> Some feel the pull from the cradle . <p> Franklin Graham could have avoided the pulpit , but with the Rev. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cast . And what of Arlo Guthrie ? With a dad like Woody , a legend who moved a young Bob Dylan to become a singer , it 's unlikely he considered much else . <p> Following in such footsteps is n't easy . And sometimes people beg you to avoid a profession that would appear to offer a long row to hoe . <p> When a young Miller Williams , the son of an eloquent Arkansas minister , told a college adviser he wanted to major in languages , he was told he had no aptitude for it and diverted to biology . After a dozen years of teaching college sciences , Miller , who had never stopped writing his beloved poetry , was hired in 1961 as a teaching poet at Louisiana State University . <p> So he followed his bliss . He even was invited to read his work at Bill Clinton 's second inauguration . But true fame has eluded the man . Which is fine by him . <p> " All that 's really important is going to bed with joy , " says Williams , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; she also writes . But by putting those words to music , three-time Grammy winner Lucinda Williams has slain obscurity . <p> l <p> l <p> l <p> In the recesses of his backyard shed , Johnson keeps a piece of the past that signaled his destiny . <p> " This , " he says , " is Raymond , " hauling out a black chest and snapping back the lid to reveal a dummy dressed like a train engineer . <p> Johnson 's grandfather , a sheet-metal engineer who did magic on the side , made the Howdy Doody-like sidekick for him ; by age 13 , Johnson was opening his shows . <p> Johnson kept at it during college , after which he worked a series of odd jobs and briefly considered a life in the ministry . But the pull of the puppets was too strong . <p> " Well , howw-dy , " Raymond drawls , eyes clicking faintly as they dart from side to side . Johnson 's boys are riveted ; they 've never seen Raymond . After the dummy 's eerie gaze spooked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for good . <p> But neither of Johnson 's sons is put off ; in fact , the 3-year-old keeps tapping the dummy on the leg to get his attention . Through Dad 's skill , this hunk of wood and fabric is alive . " Kind of magical , huh ? " Johnson says . <p> The boys have the bug ; each has his own array of hand puppets . They might even have a showbiz gene : Johnson 's homemaker mother played a clown at parties , while Cherie was Snoopy at Knott 's Berry Farm and then a Lego character at Legoland , the theme park where the couple met and where Johnson draws a steady paycheck . <p> " It 's hard to see him struggle , " Cherie says . " People who 've seen him at Legoland come up to him and say ' Oh , you 're the bird guy ! ' But he ca n't get a bigger break . The age of technology does n't seem to go with ventriloquism . " <p> But Johnson is n't giving up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a forklift driver . " At least I 'm not there , " he says as Raymond 's eyes lock on the horizon . <p> l <p> l <p> l <p> Never underestimate the power of a cruddy job to inspire a dream . <p> " We 've all had bad jobs in our lives , which is good because they help us focus on doing something that we love , even if sometimes that thing is strange , " says Justin Racz , who cataloged a bizarre array of metiers in 50 Jobs Worse Than Yours . Oddest included maggot wrangler and garbage barge skipper . " What 's interesting is they all loved their jobs . " <p> So does onetime newspaper delivery man Bryan Bowers , who left that job behind for a life on the streets playing the autoharp , that odd contraption made famous a half-century back by country music 's Carter Family . <p> Bowers is now in the Autoharp Hall of Fame ( yes , there is one ) and has cut records with big Nashville stars . But that 's only after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd play all morning outdoors in Seattle 's market , then head over and perform at a church , then a coffeehouse , and finally over at the rough bars ending up with all the drunks , " says Bowers , 65 , of Sedro-Woolley , Wash . <p> He still relishes the challenge of luring a few coins from passersby . <p> " Once I played a job for $1,000 . But I put that check in my pocket , hit the street to play and in a few hours had $17 for a steak , " he says . " That was the best-tasting steak I ever had . It reminded me that back when I had nothing , I could still put food in my stomach doing what I loved . I 'm lucky . " <p> l <p> l <p> l <p> The morning sun spreads out across San Diego County like a golden blanket . Not a cloud for miles . Johnson is back in the Saturn headed for Legoland in Carlsbad . <p> On the wall of the dressing room are photos of performers who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the 405 Freeway to Hollywood . <p> " Anthony Edwards came up to me after a show once because his wife did n't believe I was really throwing my voice , " Johnson says of the former ER star . " He always says hello when he comes back . That 's a nice friendship . " <p> But it has n't led to any TV work . So for now , Johnson 's audience remains antsy kids , three shows a day , five days a week . These tots do n't know Candice Bergen , let alone her father , Edgar , and yet they eat Johnson up . <p> Maybe it 's the puppets and their Punch-and-Judy war of words , or maybe it 's the goofy way Johnson shoots one eyebrow skyward , Jim Carrey-like . What-evah . It 's 20 minutes of open-mouthed guffaws . <p> Matilda asks to sing . <p> " Go ahead , " Johnson says . <p> Matilda : " Did you just call me goathead ? " <p> The kids howl . Pure gold . <p> Afterward , Tom Emrick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater . " I tell you , Bergen would move his lips . Kevin never does , " he booms . " And you could n't find a nicer guy . He 'd go like gangbusters on , say , a cruise ship . " <p> Johnson does n't hear this . Better that way . He 's on a high from an ad-libbed bit where Clyde croaked " Take me with you ! " to a dad hauling off a crying kid . Big laughs . <p> " Moments like that feel great . " Johnson shakes his head . " Man , if I could have just been around during vaudeville . Or on The Ed Sullivan Show . Those were the days . "
