It 's the unveiling of your firm 's grandest project yet , the one that will cement  --  or ruin  --  your international reputation . And you hope and pray no one notices your work . For acoustics designers like Yasuhisa Toyota , success arrives when an audience is rapt in the music , oblivious to the complicated physics it takes to project a Beethoven symphony with warmth and clarity . Toyota is the director of Nagata Acoustics , a tiny Tokyo company that has just completed a plum assignment : collaborating with architect Frank Gehry on the long-awaited $274 million Walt Disney Concert Hall , which opened to critical praise in Los Angeles in October . <P> One of about 20 companies that compete globally for high-profile acoustical consulting projects like the Disney Hall , Nagata Acoustics , a Japanese firm , was an unusual choice for such a signature American arts venue . The private company , which has 14 employees and $2.5 million a year in revenue , was founded 32 years ago by Minoru Nagata , a sound engineer for Japan 's main public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music was still very foreign , " says Nagata , now 78 and semi-retired , though still an adviser to the company . So was acoustic science . " We had only Western texts and trial and error to go by . " But as the nation began furiously building new civic spaces , Japanese acousticians developed into some of the world 's best . <P> Toyota , Nagata 's protege and the company 's public face abroad , joined the firm after graduating from the Kyushu Institute of Design in Fukuoka in 1977 . His work on Japan 's premier music venue , Tokyo 's Suntory Hall , completed in 1986 , drew favorable comparisons with the world 's great concert halls . Suntory 's sound and the unusually warm rapport that Toyota shared with Gehry after they met persuaded the Disney team to award Nagata the $1.4 million contract . <P> Acoustics is a notoriously inexact science . Acoustical flops of the 1960s , like New York City 's Lincoln Center and Los Angeles ' Dorothy Chandler Pavilion , took some of the luster off the profession . Lincoln @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what happens when you leave acoustics up to academics . It 's like going to a dietitian to cook you a great meal . Nutritionally , it may be perfect , but it 'll probably lack something . " For an engineering job , acoustical consulting requires exceptionally delicate people skills : designers must juggle the vision of the architect , the quirks of the orchestra and the whims of philanthropists and city officials . <P> The Disney Hall was born of a $50 million gift given in 1987 by Walt Disney 's widow Lillian . The radically curvy building opened six years late and at more than twice its original $110 million price tag because disagreements over Gehry 's unorthodox design , coupled with California 's economic woes ( the mid-1990s version ) , slowed construction . <P> The key challenge the project presented to Toyota was working with the flowing arcs of Gehry 's 2,265-seat hall . The vineyard-style ceiling , which ripples in waves above the audience , asks much more of an acoustician than the classic shoebox-style design of a traditional concert hall . And Gehry 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crannies where sound is lost , plus a hidden stage behind the main one .
