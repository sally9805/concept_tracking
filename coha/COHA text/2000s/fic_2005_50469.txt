THE LORELEI IS GONE NOW . Where she stood is now a bare promontory of stone , overlooking the Rhine under a moon whose light hides more than it illuminates . Where once I saw her , languid and deadly , trailing an arm in the shallows , there is now a stunted bush struggling to cast a shadow . Another time Ryder painted her behind a gaunt and broken oak , peering down at a lone fisherman . The fisherman 's net dangled forgotten in his hands , and he gazed enraptured at her while the boat drifted toward the rocks that would be his death . But Ryder , knowing he was the fisherman , nearly always painted the Lorelei alone . <p> I knew Albert Pinkham Ryder for twenty-one years , long enough that I can tell you the story of the Lorelei from the beginning . I do not know where it ends . <p> When the acid in my stomach keeps me awake , I leave Martha sleeping and go upstairs , to watch the moon mark the passage of the night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think of Ryder my remembrances gather the Lorelei up from that part of my soul that was once romantic , once able and yearning to believe in an invisible world not our own . Often daybreak , and the sounds of my dear Martha rising , letting the dog into the yard , making breakfast - all of this draws me back into the present , this abominable , apocalyptic year of 1943 in which I am a poor man who once was wealthy , a man of seventy who once was young . It is all because of Ryder , because his unflagging pursuit of art drew me into its wake , and because I failed to meet the example he set . <p> My name is Charles Pelletier . I came to New York from Bangor , Maine , in 1896 , with a degree from the Maine State Teacher 's College folded in the briefcase my uncle Philip had presented to me as a graduation gift . Both of my parents passed away when I was young , leaving Uncle Philip as my sole benefactor ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Millinocket and Old Town , so my schooling was a burden he assumed willingly and with ease . My desire for a career in New York was less palatable to him , but he himself had abandoned the place of his birth when he came to Bangor from Wolfville , Nova Scotia , so perhaps he attributed my wanderlust to an inherited family trait . In any event , he questioned me sharply , ascertained the strength of my commitment , and at last agreed to furnish me with a small allowance during my first year in the city . At the end of that period , it was understood , I was either to stand on my own two legs or return to Bangor , where I would take up a place in Uncle Philip 's business . <p> My real reason for wanting to come to New York , of course , was to paint . I would put my degree to good use only until the income from my art enabled me to free myself of Uncle Philip 's largess - and from the onerous life of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Homer and Eakin and Chase Whistler and everyone else I could find , to learn from them and put their acquaintance to good use . Commissions too cheap or jejune for those established figures would , I imagined , begin to come my way once I had demonstrated my ability ; and I felt certain that I would more than match up to the task . <p> On April the seventeenth , I stepped off a train and was swept away in the mad crosscurrents of Manhattan . I found lodging in a rooming house near Washington Square , on Macdougal Street ; my single room had large windows facing south , and before I 'd even eaten a meal in the city I purchased a new easel and several canvases from an artists ' supply house on Eighth Street . Walking through the park with my goods , I felt firmly at home in a way that is only possible when you find yourself actually doing something that for years has been the material of dream . Two boys played with a dog ; couples walked slowly around the fountain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water tank over a row of buildings on Fourth Street . <p> I noticed the old man slouched before an easel scant seconds before he spoke to me . " Are you a student , there ? " <p> I stopped and set my roll of canvases on the stones of the path . " No sir , " I said . " I intend to be an artist . " <p> " So you 're a student , " he said , and scratched at his wild beard . His fingers left streaks of yellow and red in the gray . With the same hand he gestured at his easel . " You can take this as your first lesson if you like . " <p> Stifling an arch remark , I stepped around him to look , and saw that his subject was the same line of rooftops over which I had remarked the water tank . The tank shone like a lighthouse beacon , gathering the scene to itself and casting carriages and passersby in the colors that stained the artist 's whiskers . The effect was of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never painted anything remotely like it , had no idea in fact that the artist 's brush could transform paint into fire too bright to look at . I thought of my own canvases , carefully rolled and stored in Uncle Philip 's attic . Once I had slept outside on the shores of Chimney Pond so that I could capture Mount Katahdin at dawn ; but my dawn was the pinched wick of a candle next to the incandescence I now beheld . My first lesson indeed . <p> " Marvelous , " I said , though I was n't sure I liked what he had done . It was too much , perhaps , an excess of color , overdone as a drawing-room sonnet - but so compelling ! I looked a while longer , and my teacher took up his brush and went back to work . Shadows grew , and the sky took on the pallor recognizable to any man who has ever seen a smokestack . At some point I stopped observing and began analyzing , and just as I became conscious of the change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 've seen enough for one day . " <p> Startled , I wondered how long I had stood watching him . " Would you mind if I came to see you again ? " <p> He turned to look at me from beneath the brows of an Old Testament prophet . " You can come back when you have something to show me , " he said , and went back to his work . <p> The evening and the night passed without my notice . I was consumed , living only for the rising of the sun so that I might take up my brushes and fling myself into the creation of light . In the morning my trunks arrived from Bangor , but instead of furnishing my room I left them where the teamsters set them down and went back to painting . It all seems impossibly nave and romantic now , this violent awakening , but if it had not been that old man in the park it would have been someone else . I had come to New York as a disciple looking for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first painter I saw for that master . <p> For weeks I rose with the dawn to paint the line of Lower Manhattan rooftops I saw out my window . Uncle Philip 's money went straight into oils and turpentine and canvas , and enough food to keep me going . Before I knew it I 'd been in New York for a month , and seventeen canvases of my room 's southward prospect curled in the corner , unmounted . It was time to go back to the park . I had something to show . <p> On a rainy morning , freed by weather from my compulsion , I selected the best of my work and spent the day carefully reworking it . Then I left it on the easel and slept . The next morning , buoyant , I went downstairs and out into the street . I bought a bottle of wine and a cheese from a store on Thompson Street , and since the rain had cleared by then I took a turn through the park in hopes of seeing my accidental master . <p> He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occurred to me that he might not return . Perhaps he typically painted elsewhere , and had come to Washington Square on a whim . In all likelihood he had forgotten our brief conversation ; it was even possible that his brusque dismissal had been intended to ensure that I never bothered him again . <p> My optimism curdled as quickly as it had appeared . I went home despondent , crashing back to Earth after my month-long fury of optimistic ambition . The bottle of wine I 'd meant to share went instead entirely down my own throat , and when it was gone I stormed out into the windy night and walked , neither knowing nor caring where I went . After some time I found myself in Battery Park . The late-spring wind growled up from the Verrazano Narrows , cutting through my inebriation as well as my thin coat . I turned up my collar and walked more slowly , acutely aware of my vulnerability to any one of New York 's legion of robbers . I could imagine the exasperation and disappointment on Uncle Philip 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and robbed while wandering drunk along the Manhattan docks . No doubt he would terminate my allowance and demand that I come home . It was even possible that he would come to New York to fetch me , letting me baste in his disapproval as he surveyed the chaos of my room and hired men packed my possessions for their return to Bangor . My canvases would dry and crack in Uncle Philip 's attic , and one day he would dispose of them without telling me . As an old man I would recall my month in New York with embarrassment , perhaps even shame ; I would realize that men such as myself were meant for safe careers close to home . I was no adventurer , nor fortune seeker . Nor artist . <p> A piece of paper blew flapping past me and out over the water . Roused from my self-pity , I looked upwind and saw a figure slouched on a bench facing the tip of the island . He appeared to be writing , but he made no move to chase after the sheet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was gone into the darkness ; doubtless the Hudson had by now claimed it , and its words were now bleeding into the dark water . <p> I took a few steps in his direction . When he did not look up , I regarded him more carefully , debating whether to approach him . Perhaps he did not know he had lost part of whatever he was writing - and how could he see to write in the lampless night , lit only by the stars and a waning sliver of moon ? <p> Just then he lifted his hand and a second sheet of paper fluttered from his lap . It caught briefly on the arm of the next bench , then tumbled out of sight after its predecessor . <p> " I do n't know many writers , " I said , " but surely most of them do n't put their work to so sudden an end . " <p> He laughed , and then looked at me . Now that I was closer to him , I could see that his hat and coat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his shoes was untied , and the skin of his leg showed palely through a hole at the knee of his trousers . <p> " Ha , " he said . " More of them should . " <p> " What is it you 're writing there ? " <p> " Poems . " <p> Dressed like a vagabond , writing poems and feeding them to the waters , he seemed a mystical figure , a character from a fantastical story whose inexplicable actions hid a kind of wisdom . I was drawn to him . <p> " Why throw them away ? " <p> " Because they 're terrible . Nobody has ever written poems this bad . Fish are all the audience they deserve . " <p> His candor emboldened me . " If they 're so bad , why do you keep writing them ? " <p> He gave an exasperated snort . " You do n't know much about it , do you ? If you have to write poems , you write poems whether they 're good or bad . Once in a while I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a painter . " <p> Of course , was my first thought . Every strange bearded man I speak to in this city is a painter . Alcohol and frustration opened my mouth again and I said , " I hope you treat your paintings better than your poems . " <p> This seemed to make him angry . " I treat them as well as they deserve . " <p> " Beg pardon , " I said . " I 'm new to the city . I did n't mean to offend . " <p> " Too many people complain about how I treat my paintings , " he said , and began to scribble another poem . After a few lines he let it go , and it rose away . <p> " I 'm an artist , " I said . " Or rather , I mean to be . " <p> " Have you any talent ? " <p> " Yes , I do , " I said , though I was n't sure . <p> He stood and flung his remaining papers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Let 's go see . " <p> This was very likely the last thing in the world I had expected him to say . For a moment I could n't respond . <p> " Well ? " he prodded . " Are you an artist or are n't you ? " <p> " What 's your name ? " I asked him , to avoid answering his question . <p> " What 's it matter ? If I was Rembrandt or Titian , would that make your decision for you ? " <p> " No , " I said . " I 'll show you . But I 'd like to know your name . " <p> " Pinkie , " he said , and as an afterthought extended his hand . <p> And that was how I met Albert Pinkham Ryder , though I had never heard his name at the time . The art classes I had taken in Bangor , from a sulfurous Scot named Craig MacTavish , had focused on the traditional ; to him Turner was a wild-eyed savage and American art not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Bierstadt , and some of the other Americans one could see at exhibits in Boston - or , rarely , Portland-but of the living art circle in New York I knew next to nothing . I had come to the city out of some vague feeling of dissatisfaction with my teaching , and a nebulous conviction that I wanted something I would never get from MacTavish or the conservative curators of New England museums . My chance encounter in Washington Square Park , wrenching as it was , had felt like a validation of those hopes ; and when in the grip of pessimism I stumbled across Ryder , again I felt as if leaving Maine had been the right thing to do . <p> But that came later . The night I met Ryder-or I should say , the night a purported artist calling himself Pinkie invited himself to my room to look at my work - I felt only that his very oddness made him worth cultivating . If that sounds strange , recall that I was twenty-three years old , drunk , and yearning after some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to know . <p> We walked north in silence . I tried a few conversational sallies , but they blew away on the wind like one of Pinkie 's stillborn poems . When we got to my front door , he nodded and said , " The right place , anyway . " <p> " What do you mean ? " <p> " This part of the city is crawling with people who call themselves artists . Some of them actually are . " <p> " Do you live nearby ? " <p> Pinkie hesitated . " In Chelsea . Eighteenth Street . " <p> I did n't press him . We entered my room and he went directly to the canvas I 'd left to dry that afternoon . For a long time he stood looking , and I exerted all my energy not to interrupt him . <p> At last he turned away and looked at me . " Keep at it , " he said , and walked past me to the door . I watched him go , paralyzed by conflicting impulses : to thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a meal or so I could see his own work . In the end I did none of those things , and when his footsteps had faded down the stairs I mechanically closed the door , undressed , and sat on my bed looking at my best canvas by the light of a lamp that soon dimmed and went out . <p> AS DID I. When I woke up the next day , it was past noon . The sight of easel and canvas exhausted me . I set about cleaning and putting my things in order , and when night fell my room looked like the abode of a civilized man . I took the satisfaction of this work with me on a long nocturnal walk up to Madison Square and back down through the streets of Chelsea . I hesitated when I crossed Eighteenth Street , wondering if I might turn down it and encounter Pinkie again , but thinking about it I realized that he might have been an impostor , no artist at all , just a tattered insomniac willing to pander to a young stranger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Over the next weeks I began to discover the city 's galleries and museums , mostly ( I admit this with some chagrin , but later it will become clear that I was directed by an intrinsic trait of my character ) to eavesdrop on conversations about who was meeting where , and in this way I gathered information about where New York 's artists took their leisure . Pinkie had said that Washington Square harbored numbers of artists , but Greenwich Village had enough taverns and restaurants that I might drain Uncle Philip 's allowance before ever finding the salon I was certain must be there . <p> Fear of embarrassment kept me from making more direct inquiries . My experience thus far of artists in New York had been enough to encourage me , and I still spent most clear mornings putting the light through my window to the best use I knew . My encounter with Pinkie , though , had spent my reservoir of boldness ; I could n't imagine asking someone whose work I 'd seen hung at the Art Students League to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Also I spent quite a bit of time considering whether to obtain legitimate employment . Uncle Philip wrote frequently to ask how I was getting along , and I answered regularly , suggesting that I was still learning the lay of the land . It went without saying - or so I implied in my letters - that I would soon be settled in a teaching position . <p> Apparently my vagueness dissatisfied Uncle Philip , for one day in November a letter arrived from him enclosing a note of introduction to the headmaster of a private boys ' school on Thirty-third Street . It seemed that Uncle Philip had contracted the building of a summer home for this man , a Doctor Philbrick , in Kennebunk , and Doctor Philbrick had suggested that Uncle Philip 's promising nephew might be glad of an interview . It is quite a prestigious institution , wrote Uncle Philip , one with which you would be proud to associate . <p> This was a conundrum . If I failed to pursue this doubtless fortunate opportunity , Uncle Philip might well be angered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the other hand , I took up teaching , I would spend my mornings initiating the scions of Manhattan 's merchant class into the mysteries of Shakespeare and the pluperfect - instead of painting . <p> As had quickly become my habit , I took a walk to clear my head and consider the problem . With the benefit of hindsight I have no doubt that I made my way intentionally to Eighteenth Street , but at the time I found myself on the corner of Sixth Avenue as if I had fallen there from the sky . And there , shambling away from me with a loaf of bread protruding from the pocket of his coat , was Pinkie . <p> I hurried after him , calling as he turned into a doorway and fumbled for a key . <p> He looked up and frowned , his gaze darting as if he suspected I was part of a gang . " Who are you ? " <p> " We met in Battery Park , " I said , trying to catch my breath . " You were writing poems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his gestures that night . <p> " Ah , " he said . " Still imitating ? " <p> " Imitating ? " I said dumbly . " Imitating who ? " <p> " Your sun , " Pinkie said . He inserted his key in the lock . " What good is the form and color of a sun if it does n't burn you ? " <p> I could form no response . Had n't he encouraged me ? Had I misremembered our entire interaction ? <p> " You 're still painting what you see . Imitation . Paint instead what you feel about what you see . " <p> " I am , " I said . " I do . " <p> One corner of his mouth quirked . " I doubt , " he said , and gestured for me to follow him as he shouldered the door open . <p> A lamp was burning in his room as we entered , and I marveled at his carelessness . I would no more leave a flame when I left my room than I would strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more often considered the latter than the former . That pedestrian surprise , though , was soon washed away by what I can only call awe at the squalid chaos of Pinkie 's studio . Canvases lay everywhere : leaning against walls , stacked atop one another , half-buried by heaps of rubbish . A small clear space on the floor provided an approach to his easel , and on a small table next to it clustered tubes of paint , buckets of varnish and turpentine , brushes piled like fallen sticks , even candles whose melt spilled over the table 's edges to spot the floor . The odors of all these things , in addition to the indelicate aroma emanating from Pinkie himself , overwhelmed my senses , but even through the involuntary tears that blurred my vision I could see enough to be staggered by the power of his work . <p> No one who has seen Ryder 's paintings since his death can have any idea of their impact . His pursuit of particular effects was absolute and in the end self-annihilating ; to achieve his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon varnish upon wax upon paint upon whatever else he thought might bring to life his singular vision . While these canvases lived , there was nothing like them in the world . Even now , when he is twenty years in the grave , Ryder 's work is a gate it does not do to approach too closely . This may sound melodramatic - but I have not yet spoken of the Lorelei . <p> " I went to Europe a few years ago , four or five , " Pinkie said . " Twice , now that I think about it . Something seized me there . I paint differently now . " <p> The canvas I beheld on his easel was dominated by a fierce sweep of yellow-green light , arcing from the top left of the frame across and down to the bottom right corner , where it hung on the fingertips of a stooped , almost a Blakean , figure straddling the uppermost crag of a mountain . The rock seemed real enough to sweat , and the tiny female figure bathed in the great demigod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beloved of a dreamer . No art is well described in words , and I have done poor justice to this work of Ryder 's , but let it be entered in my defense that Ryder 's art is utterly incommensurable with written language where the work of most his peers is merely difficult to talk about . Certainly he could not talk about it without resorting to gnomic aphorism . <p> " Who is she ? " I breathed . <p> Ryder shrugged . " These fantastical scenes , they capture me now . I feel sometimes as if I 've been noticed , as if a slow eternal gaze has fallen upon me , and having brought me into focus has surrounded me with a world of magic and danger and .... " He trailed off , grew a little sheepish ; licked his thumb and rubbed at one of the mountains in the background . " Feel like I 'm getting close to something , or something 's getting close to me , " he mumbled . Licked and rubbed again . " Well . Hm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away by some interaction of his saliva with whatever he had slathered on the canvas earlier in the day . I looked away from him , was equally overwhelmed by everything else I saw , and foundered . I struggled to find words . <p> The sound of a young woman 's voice drifted in through the open door . I tore my eyes from the canvases arrayed-well , scattered-around the room and looked at Pinkie , only to see that he looked every bit as stunned and overwhelmed as I felt . A question flashed through my mind : How could he bear it ? How could he bear to feel this way every day ? Surely it would destroy a man to experience such a consuming passion every moment he stood before his easel ; and was it this that drove him down to Battery Park in the darkest hours , to create things for which he cared nothing and fling them away on the unlettered winds ? <p> This reaction surely betrays the fact that although I might have been a painter-and a successful one , in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryder was . My own work never moved me except insofar as it hinted that I had absorbed some of the reflected brilliance of my betters . <p> And in any case , I had completely misapprehended the source of Ryder 's rapture . <p> He opened his mouth and paused as if he had forgotten what he meant to say . Then , softly , he said , " Has ever man heard a more beautiful sound ? " And rushed from the room . <p> I followed him down the hall , and caught up to him as he knocked heavily on the last door before the stair . His body trembled before it as before an altar , and when it opened Pinkie knelt and said , " Was it you who sang to me ? " <p> A young woman , ordinary in face and dress , her sleeves rolled to the elbows , stood in the doorway . " I beg your pardon , sir ? " she said . Looking from Pinkie to me , she frowned . <p> " Your song , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aye , sir , I did sing , " she said . Again her gaze flicked to me as if I might interfere-or , alternatively , explain ; but I could do neither . <p> " It was a song to save a man 's soul , " Pinkie said . " I can not be without it . Without you . Will you be my wife ? " <p> Plain shock smoothed the lines on the girl 's face . " Who are you ? " <p> " I am he for whom you sang , " said Pinkie . " When we are married , I will paint your voice . Please . " His hand disappeared into his coat pocket , and he spilled a handful of papers onto the floor by his knees . Bank drafts , a dozen or more , some of them for sums greater than Uncle Philip had proposed as my year 's funding . Who was this man , that he lived in squalor , crumpled his commissions in a pocket , and proposed to marry a washerwoman half his age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes widened at the sight of the drafts scattered on the grimy wooden floor . I could see her performing the calculus every poor unmarried woman has worked through a thousand times , and coming to the expected solution . <p> " Mister Albert Ryder , " she said , " I will be your wife . " <p> He closed his eyes and reeled back . " What is your name ? " <p> " Frances Mulrooney . " <p> Pinkie-Albert Pinkham Ryder-stood and took her hand . He bent to kiss it , courtly as a duke , then straightened again . " Frances , I will return tomorrow . Think of me tonight , as I will think of nothing but you . " <p> " Good night , Mr. Ryder , " said Frances , and shut the door . <p> I wondered where her mother and father were , and what they would say when she announced her betrothal to the eccentric artist down the hall . Their astonishment would turn to speculation when she described the handful of uncashed checks I was even then rushing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ toward his room . The drafts in hand , I was about to call out to him when another voice preempted my own . <p> " Pinkie ! Come to dinner ! " <p> The speaker was a hale and mustachioed man midway in age between Ryder and myself . He strode around the railing at the top of the stairs and past me to follow Ryder into his room . I trailed after , and entered Pinkie 's studio in time to hear him say , " Stanley , I have met my life 's companion tonight , my muse and helpmeet . We will be married tomorrow . " <p> " Good God , " said Stanley . " Who ? " <p> Pinkie was rummaging through the heaps of abandoned paintings , flinging aside whatever junk came to hand . " A nightingale , an angel , at the end of the hall . I had never known she was there , and today-just now-I heard her sing . I can not be without her . She is all that matters now . " He banged into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . Brown sludge lapped over the edge . For a dazed moment I envisioned him dipping a finger in it and then smearing it carefully onto one of his canvases , where the browns were n't quite viscid and runny enough . <p> Stanley turned to me . He noted that I held in my left hand a large number of bank drafts . " Do n't tell me he gave you those . " <p> " No , he offered them to the girl , " I answered . " I picked them up when he walked away . " <p> He extended a hand and I gave him the checks . He set them on a bureau near the door , but made no move to clean up the spilled stew . " She did n't take them ? " <p> I shook my head . <p> " So she rejected his proposal . " <p> " No , she accepted it all right . But she left the checks where they were . " <p> This clearly disturbed Stanley . " Who is she ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dressed like a domestic . She was singing some kind of ballad , and when Pinkie heard it he rushed off like she was a mermaid . " <p> Stanley turned to Ryder . " Pinkie , this is absurd . " <p> Ryder ignored him . He 'd found the canvas he was looking for and now he dipped a dirty rag in a bucket of dirtier water and ran the cloth across its surface . I could n't help but wince ; Stanley 's lack of reaction indicated he 'd seen it all before . <p> " For years I 've felt her getting closer , " Pinkie murmured . He looked at me . " Was n't I just telling you that , Charles ? Now at last I see her . " <p> His fingers trailed across the canvas as he set the easel 's previous occupant against the wall and put this new one in its place . I looked more closely at it , and felt an odd twinge at the memory of Pinkie saying Feel like I 'm getting close to something , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this canvas was the same crag of rock , this time looming over a forbidding valley . In the sky at center , the life of a pale moon bled out into thin clouds ; below , a curve of river , and in the bottom right corner a man in a boat , indistinct , outlined and hinted at . Perhaps because of Pinkie 's words and the moment , the image seemed to me fraught with expectation and longing , emptiness deepened by false hope . <p> But now I am confusing experience and memory . In truth , the canvas was scarcely more than a sketch , crude lines and savage angles , bleak and muted colors . Still Pinkie caressed it as if he might draw something from it to explain his behavior-and still , I tell you , the composition was the same . <p> " Pinkie , " Stanley said sharply . " You ca n't marry a girl you 've never met just because you heard her singing down the hall . " <p> " Who never loved , that loved not at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's sake . We 're not talking about first sight , are we ? Shakespeare never said anything about first sound . And even if he had , this is n't a play , and Romeo and Juliet ended up dead . " <p> " Go away , Stanley , " Pinkie grunted . He still had n't taken his eyes from the sketch . <p> " I am , next week . Remember ? London ? Might be a good idea if you came with us . " <p> " Tomorrow I will marry her . " <p> Stanley turned to me . " Apologies for my discourtesy . Stanley Terrell . " <p> " Charles Pelletier . " We shook hands . When Stanley said something in French , I added , " From Maine . " <p> His smile was mostly devoid of malice . " And how do you know Pinkie , Charles ? " <p> " I 'm new to the city . I met him in Battery Park and he came to my room to look at my paintings . " <p> Stanley 's left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ painter as well . Do you know Ryder 's work ? " <p> Again I felt a little unsteady , as the recent memory of walking into this room flooded over me . " Just today , " I said . " It 's extraordinary . " <p> " It is that . But if I may be permitted another borrowing from the Bard , Pinkie is a bit of a stranger in the world . We - his friends - occasionally have to look after him , and this is one of those occasions . I hope I wo n't offend you if I suggest that he and I need to address this issue in private . " <p> " No , " I said . " I understand perfectly . " And I did , though I could barely stand the excitement and curiosity the previous half hour had aroused and I wanted nothing more than to be in on whatever happened next . It was the stuff of legend , the artist saved from himself by the intervention of friends , and I was witnessing it firsthand . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's card as he shut Pinkie 's door in my face , leaving me alone and exhilarated by proximity to the man who is still the only genius I have ever known . <p> PINKIE 'S FRIENDS DID take him abroad for a little while , and when they returned there was no more talk of marriage . The girl moved out and disappeared , and Pinkie , as long as I knew him , never spoke directly of her again . <p> Which is not to say that he never spoke of her . The unfinished canvas he 'd excavated from the wreckage of his studio that day became his voice for her . I am sure of it . I am sure , too , that when he said he had felt her coming closer to him he was right . Too many things are otherwise inexplicable . <p> The first of these is his sudden engrossment in a strange poem of Heine 's that Stanley Terrell later ( years later , when Pinkie was dead and Terrell and I had come to an understanding ) told me Pinkie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Ich wei nicht , was soll es bedeuten <p> Da ich so traurig bin ; <p> Ein Mrchen aus alten Zeiten , <p> Das kommt mir nicht aus dem Sinn . <p> I know not why it should be that I am so unsettled ; a fable from olden days will not leave my mind . How many sleepless nights I have passed with these lines rolling through my mind , wondering if what I know to be true is in fact the truth . Ryder 's art was always about the pursuit of the unknowable , the unreachable ; and knowing him , I came too close to things I myself should never have known and could never reach . This doomed us both , and in different ways we each chose this fate . <p> I remember an argument among two portraitists ( we were all portraitists , but these two had settled into it and did little else ) about the correct translation of traung . Distressed , claimed the first , but the other argued that was too faint , that there was a power @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to capture . " I mean , really , " he said . " Distressed ? Losing your hair ? " Unmanned was that party 's preference , and then the conversation grew vulgar and comical . Where this dispute took place I do not recall , nor the names of those involved - the only other recollection I have of the evening is of Ryder himself , watching the exchange but not participating , a smile of what might have been condescension playing at his lips . He knew something they did not , and they did not know the difference : this was one thing that marked him as an artist while they painted portraits . <p> As did I. My part in the story is yet to come . <p> Apart from moments like that one , Ryder betrayed no sign that he longed for the girl at the end of the hall . The only reason I knew is that he took me into an oblique confidence over the next years , as he painted and repainted the Lorelei . It had begun as a commission from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ryder to his Blakelock and Homer ; when I first saw it he had been working on it for some time . Years . This was not unusual . Ryder often worked on a single painting for years , and more than once his exasperated buyer would suggest having his funeral procession stop by Ryder 's studio - to which Ryder unfailingly replied , If it is ready . <p> The Lorelei , though . She occupied him from sometime in the early Nineties until his death in 1917 . The canvas grew gnarled and ridged from coats of paint and layers of whatever else he worked into it as he sought the woman whom he could never have . <p> Periodically Ryder would appear in my doorway and invite me to his studio , where he would either groan or exult over the progress he 'd made on the Lorelei . By this time I had abandoned the pursuit of teaching - my skill with oils meant that I could make a careful living as a portraitist and painter of opulent homes . Occasionally my work appeared in the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither fame nor notoriety , and certainly not wealth . Two of the three came later , and not together . <p> I could never visit Pinkie without the feeling that he was trying to tell me something . He hovered at the edge of my field of vision , and it seemed at times that my presence brought other lines from Heine 's poem to his lips . <p> It 's often been remarked that Ryder did little new after the 1890s , spending his time dithering over commissions and reworking canvases from earlier parts of his career . This is true . The Lorelei had claimed him by then . <p> It would be years before she claimed me , and then only because Ryder gave her the strength . In the interim , events conspired to test me , and enough time has now passed that I can admit I failed the test utterly . <p> In the spring of 1897 , Uncle Philip discontinued his support and demanded that I return to Bangor . I had expected this since my failure to pursue the teaching opportunity he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . For perhaps the last time in my life I demonstrated a backbone , and refused my uncle 's order . He wrote me a curt letter , and I rededicated myself to making a life for myself in New York City . It cost me quite a bit of pride , but I made inquiries among the circle of artists and patrons who orbited Pinkie 's studio , and eventually I was able to eke out a subsistence livelihood painting portraits and landscapes . My talent was unexceptional , but I can claim for myself a certain competency , and later I was to discover unexpected reservoirs within myself . Or perhaps I should say that the Lorelei made me aware of them . <p> Or bestowed them upon me . <p> Die Luft is khl und es dunkelt , <p> Und ruhig fliet der Rhein ; <p> Der Gipfel des Berges funkelt <p> Im Abensonnenschein . <p> The air is cool and it 's getting dark , and the Rhine flows quietly ; the mountains glow with the evening sun . A loose translation , but it will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially since the nymph herself has vanished from it . <p> Die schnste Jungfrau sitzet <p> Door oben wunderbar , <p> Ihr goldenes Geschmeide blitzet , <p> Sie kmmt ihr goldnes Haar . <p> Sie kmmt es mit goldenem Kamme <p> Und singt ein lied dabei ; <p> Das hat eine wundersame , <p> Gewaltige Melodei . <p> No wonder Ryder responded so powerfully to these lines . The most beautiful girl sits over there , wondrous , showing her golden treasure , combing her golden hair . The Jungfrau is a mountain and a woman , and her golden hair is at the same time the sunset on the peak . Ryder 's landscapes were always alive , always so much more important than whatever human figures inhabited them - and after his death , his Lorelei faded into the mountain overlooking the Rhine . She combs with a golden comb , and sings a song meanwhile , that has a strange , powerful melody . <p> This poem ! When I should be painting , I find myself reciting its lines under my breath , in German even though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to parrot Heine 's lines . The first time I remember doing so was sometime in 1907 , I think . Ryder 's health was already beginning to fail ; his kidneys gave him terrible trouble , and the strange aura of wise navet that once accompanied him faded . During the last ten years of his life he was almost literally a shadow of his younger self - a shabby , unwashed , ill recluse who painted and painted but finished almost nothing . My financial health paralleled his physical decline . After the turn of the century , my small niche in the New York art market grew even smaller , until I was faced with losing the room I had by that time inhabited for nearly twelve years . I was thirty-five years old , with no prospects , relying on a circle of more successful acquaintances to keep me in bread and paint . The shame of this time in my life has never quite left me , although my most shameful behavior was still to come . <p> I will avoid it no longer . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easel , gazing with loathing at a series of sketches I had executed in preparation for a portrait of a ten-year-old daughter of a Yonkers automobile whiz . Father and daughter were both gaudy and soulless , but their commission meant another three months ' rent , and I had no other paying work . Circumstances had degenerated to the point that I had begun to consider teaching work again . To put the thought out of my mind , I started to mutter under my breath , and it was Heine 's lines that came from my mouth . I do not remember beginning to paint , but I have a confused recollection that everything around me grew in intensity - became more there , is the only way I can articulate the experience . Colors , the sensation of breath in my lungs and the slight drag of the brush as I drew it across the canvas , the sound of rote German repeated endlessly , unconsciously , as the night flew . At last the mundane intervention of my bladder brought me out of this fugue , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with profound shock realized that I had not painted a daughter of the as-yet-unnamed Gasoline Aristocracy at all . I had painted a marvelous Albert Pinkham Ryder . <p> The Lorelei was near . <p> I THOUGHT TO SPEAK of this to Ryder , but the next time I saw him he was consumed with deranged optimism . " I am finding her again , " he assured me as we regarded his latest work . " You see , Charles , what has become of me these last years . My reputation grows ; everything I paint sells if I wish it to ; but it 's a Faustian bargain , because what I wish to paint is lost to me . Until now . " <p> The canvas before me was - and this pains me terribly to say , because I have never admired any man the way I admired Pinkie Ryder - a miserable failure . Muddy , without any sense of composition , lacking even Ryder 's typically casual approach to the human form . Stick figures against a background that might have been heath @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and would never again paint anything of any significance . At least part of this sad denouement is my fault . At the time I had an inkling of what was happening , and was idiotic enough to welcome it ; only later would I understand what I had done . Again it would be Heine 's lines that pulled back the veil . <p> Den Schiffer im kleinen Schiffe <p> Ergreift es mit wildem Weh ; <p> Er schaut nicht die Felsenriffe , <p> Er schaut nur hinauf in die Hh . <p> Ich glaube , die Wellen verschlingen <p> Am Ende Schiffer und Kahn ; <p> Und das hat mit ihiem Singen <p> Die Lorelei getan . <p> The sailor in his little boat is gripped with wild sighs ; he does n't see the reefs , he only looks at the sky . I believe the waves will fling both boat and man to their end - and that , with her song , the Lorelei did . <p> The night Ryder heard the Lorelei sing - through Frances Mulrooney if you will - he was painting himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he understood that he had spooky poem he had heard on a tour of Europe , to understand that he in fact was the fisherman , and the Lorelei - wherever she was - called him to a golden , melodic doom . <p> The Lorelei was his Galatea , and he a Pygmalion with brushes instead of chisels . He brought her to life . Before Ryder thought to paint her , she was a legend , a Rhineland Siren palely copied from whatever bastardized Homeric stories seafaring Teutons brought back from their Mediterranean adventures . His initial faltering starts on the painting brought her close enough to life that she could force herself the rest of the way , I pity Frances Mulrooney sometimes . What must it be like , to pledge yourself to a strange artist in the hall outside your apartment and then never see him again ? Did she feel that she had been part of something larger even than love ? Did she feel the Lorelei briefly alight on her as if she were an oasis in the desert between fantasy and the sensual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same time I believe what I write here . Part of it is an attempt to justify myself , yes , but I was a little bit in love with him as well . An admiring , courtly kind of passion . Even had I mustered the nerve to speak of it , nothing would have happened . Ryder was a childlike Petrarchan when it came to women , and a lover of good cigars and wine more than either sex . Perhaps this accounts for the Lorelei he created . One of the modern painters would create a Lorelei more like Rosie the Riveter than Homer 's sirens , but Ryder and I were men of our times , and the Lorelei a frightened idealization of Woman and Art and the Unknown . Which for us were three different ways of saying the same thing . <p> Ryder 's reefs were made of the Lorelei herself , or perhaps of his pursuit of her . The rocks on which I was to founder were composed of less rarefied stuff . <p> The Yonkers auto manufacturer revoked my commission when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a study . I was desperate , and in my desperation made a decision that brought me tremendous success - and taught me how bitter success can be . <p> An artist knows no shortage of shady characters . We are a nave lot , and where there is money and navet will be found all manner of swindlers and genteel criminals . One such was a man widely understood to be a trader in art of dubious provenance . I will call him Bruce Cleaves , since it would be petty of me to expose him after he did so much for me . I called Cleaves to my apartment and showed him the Ryder . He looked it over , and just like that I became a forger . Cleaves demanded a canvas per month from me , an inhuman schedule but a necessary one given that sooner or later buyers would catch on . He sold my Ryders in places where Ryder was known only by reputation : Oregon , Texas , Colorado , California . To this day there are movie moguls who proudly show their latest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cleaves took care to broker some of my own work as well , primarily uninspired dockside scenes for tourists and others who want nothing more from art than a recapitulation of their own memories . As a result of this legitimate success , moderate though it was , I was able to court and marry Martha Van Pelt , the third daughter of an old New York family . Her father and aunt were devoted to Ryder 's work , and I believe that I was granted her hand because I brought them both to his studio once in 1913 . Ryder was then , at sixty-six , a kind of peripheral darling of American art ; at the epochal Armory Show that same year , he was the only native artist hung in the central gallery . By bringing the two elder Van Pelts to the omphalos of this strange genius , I secured the hand of the woman I had come to love . <p> I also turned Ryder into a sideshow curiosity , but this was not my worst transgression against him . Without doubt the vilest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her life , and when he was weakened through the best intentions of his friend , I led him further astray . <p> Sometimes in lighter moods Pinkie would set Heine 's words to the tune of a popular song , and lilt around the catastrophe of his studio as he dabbed at the Lorelei . At other times the sight of the perpetually unfinished work brought out a grim determination in him . As he grew more eccentric , he began to ask me to observe his progress on the painting , and God help me , I did everything I could to prolong his agony of conception . If the Lorelei was at the riverside , I suggested she perch on a rock ; if she reclined , I suggested a standing posture ; if he gave her blond hair , I remarked on the deep reds and oranges of sunset . For years I was able to tell myself a dual lie : that I was preserving myself and not injuring him because he would never have finished the painting on his own in any case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fits of Lorelei obsession . Only the part about self-preservation is true . <p> As long as I kept Pinkie heading down blind alleys , the Lorelei stayed with me . To this day I do n't know whether I actually summoned her by murmuring Heine 's lines while I stood at my easel , but after her annunciation in my room in 19071 never dared alter the routine . Did she know Ryder had lost the initial force of genius that created her ? Perhaps . I believe now that she battened on me because I was there when she sang in Frances Mulrooney 's voice , and because Pinkie trusted me . She might have found a thousand more talented artists in New York , but I have had years of long nights to consider this , and I think she simply left master for disciple . Created by Ryder , she turned to a secondhand Ryder when the original began to fail her . When the creator fails the creation , what then ? <p> All of this is an attempt to forge the numinous into a chain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't matter . In 1915 , Ryder 's health collapsed . He was hospitalized for some time , and upon his release he had to leave New York for the house of Charles and Louise Fitzpatrick , patrons and friends with a house on Long Island . He died in 1917 , and the next year was given a one-man show at the Met . His death made my trade immensely lucrative ; Cleaves once told me that there were at least three times as many ersatz Ryders as genuine , and I have done more than my share to fatten the ratio . <p> The Lorelei was found in his studio , nearly destroyed by his twenty-year obsession . Well-meaning admirers attempted to restore it , but she had been fading , and soon was entirely gone . <p> As was my career when , a year after Pinkie 's death and soon after the Met show , Bruce Cleaves ran afoul of a sharp-eyed dealer in - of all places - Tulsa , Oklahoma . Cleaves took himself off to Europe , where I hear he is still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pieces that are easy to slip over on a public with more money than taste . With the war , his fortunes took a turn for the better ; Nazi confiscations increased demand for European art and made buyers less conscientious about determining provenance . <p> I was not so lucky - or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that after staving off my just deserts for eleven years , I was forced to take account of my life . At forty-four years old I was suddenly a glorified amateur landscape painter with a house far beyond my means and a childless marriage . As an act of penance I told Martha everything , and only then , abased and contrite , did I realize how magnificent was the woman Pinkie Ryder 's acquaintance allowed me to marry . She was angry , of course - she is still angry , and twenty-five years have passed . In the midst of her fury she took hold of our financial affairs , sold the house and established us in more modest circumstances . Then she told me to paint . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work , and she has never failed to hold things together with iron competence and a good deal of financial acuity . We survived the difficulties after the Great War , and then the much worse collapse after Black Monday . Now we even own modest shares in General Motors , which makes me chuckle when I think of the Yonkers commission I neglected when the Lorelei appeared to me . Dear Martha . As in art , in marriage I have done much better than I deserved . <p> I have never tried to paint a Ryder , never whispered the maybe-incantation of Heine 's lines , since Pinkie himself died . That last year before Cleaves fled to Europe , he was selling off work I had completed while Pinkie lay bedridden at the Fitzpatricks ' . I do not know if I could paint Ryder now , but I have my doubts . My suspicion is that the Lorelei has moved on . <p> I will be seventy in three months , Pinkie 's age when he died . Here is my small penance . <p> During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal of effort into growing a beard . I think I will take my gray whiskers and I will go down to Washington Square Park . I will sit . In the darkness ... well , it is difficult to find darkness in New York in this age of electric light , despite the wartime blackouts . I will sit in the park , and I will paint what light there is to find , and if a young man or young woman with eager eyes and an armful of canvas should happen by , I will try to find words to speak of the violence of feeling . <p> IMG
