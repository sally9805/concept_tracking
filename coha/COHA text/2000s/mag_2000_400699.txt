Do n't expect a DNA-based PC anytime soon . But you might well see even stranger things  --  including DNA that computes and assembles nanostructures at the same time . <p> Leonard Adleman sends his regrets . In an e-mail faq he uses to fend off journalists seeking interviews , the University of Southern California computer scientist and world-famous cryptographer who invented the field of DNA computing confesses that " DNA computers are unlikely to become stand-alone competitors for electronic computers . " He continues , somewhat apologetically : " We simply can not , at this time , control molecules with the deftness that electrical engineers and physicists control electrons . " <p> It was in 1994 that Adleman first used DNA , the molecule that our genes are made of , to solve a simple version of the " traveling salesman " problem . In this classic conundrum , the task is to find the most efficient path through several cities-given enough cities , the problem can challenge even a supercomputer . Adleman demonstrated that the billions of molecules in a drop of DNA contained raw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But since then , scientists have run into tough practical and theoretical barriers . As Adleman and others in the field have come to realize , there may never be a computer made from DNA that directly rivals today 's silicon-based microelectronics . <p> But that does n't mean they 've given up . Far from it . Although computer scientists have n't found a clear path from the test tube to the desktop , what they have found amazes and inspires them . Digital memory in the form of DNA and proteins . Exquisitely efficient editing machines that navigate through the cell , cutting and pasting molecular data into the stuff of life . What 's more , nature packs all this molecular hi-fi equipment into a bacterium not much bigger than a single transistor . Viewed through the eyes of computer scientists , evolution has produced the smallest , most efficient computers in the world-and the beige-box set is hooked . <p> As Adleman now sees it , DNA computing is a field that 's less about beating silicon than about surprising new combinations of biology and computer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometimes in unexpected directions . Scientists are still working hard on ways to tap the awesome number-crunching abilities of DNA for specialized types of applications , such as code breaking . But beyond that , the innate intelligence built into DNA molecules could help fabricate tiny , complex structures  --  in essence using computer logic not to crunch numbers but to build things . <p> Among the most promising of these new approaches are smart " DNA tiles " invented by Erik Winfree , a 30-year-old computer scientist at California Institute of Technology ( " 100 Young Innovators , " TR November/December 1999 ) . Winfree 's brainstorm is to create nanoscopic building blocks out of DNA that not only can store data but are designed  --  Winfree likes to say " programmed "  --  to carry out mathematical operations by fitting together in specific ways . Normally , DNA exists as two intertwined strands of the chemical letters A , G , C and T  --  the familiar double helix . But Winfree 's DNA tiles are made by knotting together three or more of these strands , forming " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) on their longest side . Taking advantage of DNA 's ability to selectively recognize other strands of DNA , Winfree has " coded " the edges of these tiles so that they come together in just the right way to form tiny built-to-order structures . <p> In fact , programming DNA in this way could give chemists the kind of deft control " that may allow them to build more complex structures than any considered so far , " says Paul Rothemund , a doctoral student in Adleman 's USC lab . DNA Dominoes <p> The idea of smart DNA tiles got its start five years ago at Caltech 's Red Door cafe , when Winfree and Rothemund met to discuss Adleman 's first DNA computing paper . The publication had set imaginations blazing throughout the world and across scientific disciplines . Were there other ways to compute with DNA ? Could it beat silicon ? Rothemund brought along a stack of papers showing " all the weirdest things that had been done with DNA . " One of these was by Nadrian Seeman , a chemist at New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other unlikely shapes from the DNA double helix . Winfree , who was working on a PhD related to artificial learning in robots , immediately saw a way that Seeman 's strange versions of DNA could be used to compute . <p> Winfree 's intellectual breakthrough was inspired by the theory of Wang tiles  --  a bit of recondite mathematics related to the patterns that can be created using squares with numbered sides . Like dominoes , the numbers on each Wang tile determine which other tiles it is allowed to touch . By carefully establishing these " matching rules , " complex and interesting patterns can emerge as more tiles are added . But it 's more than just a game of mathematical dominoes . Because Wang tiles carry both data ( the numbers ) and simple rules for combining it , mathematicians in the 1960s proved that the tiles could be used to add or multiply numbers . In fact , they showed that with the right set of these hypothetical constructs you could , in theory , do anything an electronic computer can  --  from playing chess to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synthesis : use Seeman 's DNA molecules as tiny real-life Wang tiles . <p> Applied to DNA computing , the strategy could sidestep one of the fundamental problems that has bedeviled the field from the beginning  --  too much lab work . While DNA computing is good at producing a vast number of answers quickly , things slow down when it comes to picking the right answers out of the mix . Take the traveling salesman problem originally solved by Adleman , in which the object is to find the most efficient route through seven cities connected by 14 one-way flights . Adleman created strands of DNA to represent each flight , then combined them in a test tube to generate every possible route . <p> Although the DNA in one-fiftieth of a teaspoon produced 100 trillion answers in less than one second , most of those answers were repeats  --  and most of them were incorrect . So Adleman 's next task was to discard the wrong answers , something that could be done in a jiffy on a PC , but in Adleman 's case required several dozen manual @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with most DNA computing schemes  --  each " operation " on the data means another time-consuming lab step . <p> The DNA tiles could solve that problem . Unlike the DNA used by Adleman in his original experiments that combined randomly , Winfree 's tiles follow simple rules to get the correct result . " Ideally , you just put the tiles in the test tube and whammo ! , you 've got a right answer , " says John Reif , a Duke University computer scientist . <p> Working with Winfree and Thom LaBean , a biochemist at Duke , Reif hopes to put the idea into practice by creating a simple molecular abacus out of DNA tiles . The goal is to add up binary numbers from zero to eight . With genetic letters standing in for Os and 1s , the team has designed sets of tiles , each of which represents a possible column in an addition . Rules for combining columns correctly are coded into loose strands of DNA protruding from the sides of the tiles . <p> If all goes well , the experiment will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out an orderly addition of three binary bits . The scientists then will read off the results using standard methods for decoding DNA . The experiment underlines the potential power of DNA computers  --  massive parallelism and speed . Reif estimates that a single test tube of DNA tiles could perform about 10 trillion additions per second  --  about a million times faster than an electronic computer . Nanotech C++ <p> The enormous raw power of DNA computing keeps the field moving in spite of all the daunting technical obstacles . Yet even if those obstacles ultimately prove insurmountable , Winfree 's work could mean a breakthrough in the construction of ultrasmall devices . Indeed , Winfree himself thinks DNA tiles ' most exciting application is as intelligent building blocks that put themselves together piece by piece on the nanometer scale  --  assembling into large and complex structures ( see illustration , p. 82 ) . <p> Collaborating with Rothemund and Adleman at USC , Winfree aims to fabricate a two-dimensional shape known as the Sierpinski triangle . Named after the Polish mathematician who discovered it in 1915 , the triangle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple geometric rule . The team plans to construct a real-world version of the triangle in a test tube using only seven different DNA tiles . Winfree has designed each tile type to carry out a simple program  --  to add itself to the growing shape or not , depending on the molecular cues provided by the triangle 's outer edge . <p> In the hands of nanofabrication experts like NYU 's Seeman , the DNA tiles could lead to easier methods to make exotic molecular structures  --  doing for nanotech what CAD and pre-fab building materials have done for the construction industry . " Greater control leads to things that you almost ca n't imagine , " says Seeman . " Our expectation is that this approach can be applied to making designer materials and interesting patterns much more economically " <p> Seeman 's lab , for instance , is already trying to attach nanoparticles of gold to DNA tiles in order to prototype tiny electrical circuits . These DNA " assemblies " would be about 10 times smaller than the tiniest features etched in silicon chips . However , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ computable " with DNA tiles . " We ca n't make anything we want , " says Rothemund . " But the simple assemblies we 've made so far show how well the basic operations work . " <p> They also show how much scientists still have to learn . Winfree compares his efforts so far to one-line programs written in biochemical Basic . What he 'd really like to be doing is programming biochemical reactions in C++ . He expects this more advanced language will evolve as researchers master new operations , such as selectively removing tiles from an assembly . Winfree speculates that one day it may be possible to bring this growing repertoire of programmable components together to build synthetic systems  --  call them " nanorobots " if you wish  --  capable of independently carrying out useful tasks . " The really interesting direction DNA computing is taking us is to see just how far we can learn to program biochemical reactions " says Winfree . <p> That may sound like futuristic hype , but researchers are already beginning to figure out ways to do it . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for one , is working with DNA in the hopes of assembling ultrasmall molecular motors . Yurke imagines that some day it might be possible to build a DNA motor that could walk across Winfree 's DNA tiling constructs , making chemical changes at specific points . " You could lay down an arbitrarily complex pattern " Yurke says , which might then be transferred to a silicon substrate to fabricate nanometer-scale circuits and transistors . " My hope is that in the future complicated electronic structures like computers will be made this way . " <p> Electronic computers assembled using DNA that computes ? It may sound like an unlikely twist in the evolution of DNA computing , but it 's one that Adleman believes is entirely in keeping with the field he helped launch . " Like quantum computing , DNA computing is very futuristic , and both make the point that computation does n't have to take place in the box that sits on our desks " says Adleman , this time in a telephone interview . " Even if they do n't become a viable means of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they will-we may learn what the real computer of the future should look like . " Computing ( and Constructing ) With DNA TABLE <p> PHOTO ( BLACK &; WHITE ) : Computed pattern : Centimeter-sized plastic tiles show how DNA molecules could form nanostructures . Programmed Nanoconstruction A DNA tile is built from four interconnected strands of DNA . It has " sticky ends " that allow it to attach only to DNA tiles with complementary sticky ends . In a conceptual model , a total of 7 tile types are sufficient to build a complex fractal known as the Sierpinski triangle . Matching rules govern how the tiles fit together . Black connects with black , and white with white . The model illustrates how when the DNA tiles are placed together in a test tube they can begin to " self-assemble " according to the matching rules programmed into their sticky ends . As the reaction progresses , the tiles produce a large fractal structure . DNA tiles patterned in this way could be useful for nanotechnology . <p> DIAGRAMS : Programmed Nanoconstruction <p> By Antonio Regalado @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
