<p> Double trouble : Identical twin sisters Courtney and Ashley Paris are not only a dominating force as sophomores for Piedmont High , but they also offer a view of the recruiting world , complete with rumors and accusations . <p> In their first game of organized girls basketball , 11-year-old twins Ashley and Courtney Paris led their team to a 99-1 victory . They were already nearly 6-feet tall on that summer day in 1999 and exceptionally skilled : going baseline , setting screens , cutting backdoor while most of the other players fidgeted with their hair ties and tried not to double-dribble . <p> A year later , still months from becoming teenagers , the Paris twins received their first we-want-you letters from college recruiters . Before long , the girls were fully engaged in the club basketball scene , spending their summers traveling , competing against the nation 's other elite players and becoming etched in the minds of college coaches coast to coast . <p> Now sophomores at Piedmont High , Ashley and Courtney already have heard from more than 60 colleges . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best of the best all have expressed interest . <p> Theirs , though , is more than simply a tale of two phenoms . Rather , the Paris twins and their path to Piedmont offer a window into the rapidly evolving landscape of women 's basketball . It 's a world that more and more , for bet <p> <p> ter and worse , has come to mirror the men 's scene . <p> The Paris girls quickly turned a basketball lightweight into a state title contender  --  Piedmont reached the Division IV Northern California title game before losing Saturday to St. Mary 's of Stockton  --  yet their arrival in one of the Bay Area 's most affluent communities spawned not only questions but an investigation by the University of California into possible recruiting irregularities by one of its boosters . <p> The twins ' mother and stepfather , Lynne and Larry Harris , are renting a home from Kenneth Rawlings , a prominent Cal and Piedmont High booster whose daughter plays for the Highlanders and who was pivotal in bringing in former Bears men 's coach Dick Kuchen as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ways , all of this is nothing new for Lynne Harris and her daughters , who have been the subject of rumors for years . Virtually from the moment of that breakout game in the summer of ' 99 , all eyes have been on the Paris twins . Every move has been dissected , every word parsed  --  all by suspicious eyes . <p> " You have to laugh to keep from crying because it does n't necessarily feel good when people make these accusations , " Harris said . <p> Courtney Paris ' nickname is " Baby Shaq . " At an unyielding 6-foot-3 , she is the more prototypical post player than her identical twin . She is far more likely to take command of a game , as she did upon grabbing a rebound during this past summer 's 14-and-under AAU national championship game . <p> " Courtney went up above everybody , grabbed the ball with two hands , chinned it and screamed , " said Mark Anger , who coaches the sisters on his East Bay Xplosion club team . " She yelled like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire court . The game was over at that point . " <p> Ashley is 6-foot-2 but the more versatile player , a Scottie Pippen-like force who can break a full-court press single-handedly and whose athleticism is the kind that elicits oohs and ahhs . <p> Ashley and Courtney come from athletic  --  and large  --  stock . Their father is William " Bubba " Paris , the former 49ers offensive lineman who played on three Super Bowl teams . Their mother , Lynne , stands a sturdy 6-foot-1 and comes from a family loaded with athletes , including a brother , Leonard Gray , who spent three respectable seasons in the NBA . <p> The twins have been surrounded by athletes since birth . Their three older brothers and one stepbrother all are or were prep standouts , including 19-year-old David , now a freshman forward on Cal 's basketball team . Their stepfather was a three-sport athlete ( football , basketball and track ) at Stanford . <p> They were born nearly a month premature , but not a moment too soon for their mother . Already , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Bubba , not to mention a 7-year old by her high school sweetheart , Larry , with whom she would reunite eventually after splitting with Bubba . <p> This was not the plan anyone envisioned for Lynne Harris , least of all herself . She would be a congresswoman or a journalist , thought one of her teachers , but no kids , no husband to tie her down . Then she met Bubba , the gregarious , behemoth 49er , and soon they were married . And soon there were many more kids in her life . <p> " He wanted to have 14 , " she says now . " At the rate we were going , we were gon na get there . " <p> Ashley arrived at 6 pounds , 3 ounces , followed by Courtney at 6 pounds , 7 ounces . As the girls grew older , Lynne and Larry would find themselves carrying around birth certificates to provide proof of the twins ' ages . <p> The median household income in Piedmont is $134,270 , according to the most recent census figures . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grew up in Piedmont . He played on the basketball team at Piedmont High that won the 1951 Alameda County Athletic League championship , and his father , Binks Rawlings , coached at the school from 1926-34 . <p> Ken said he spent four years in the service after high school , then attended Cal , graduating with a business degree in 1959 . He was a Piedmont Highlander first , a Cal Bear second , both through and through . <p> By the mid-1980s , Rawlings had begun to amass a fortune through a cookie company he and his wife launched in 1977 , Otis Spunkmeyer Inc. , and it was n't long before he was sharing his wealth with , among others , his high school and college alma maters . <p> Lynne Harris got to know Rawlings after she signed up her daughters with Mark Anger 's AAU team . Anger , like Rawlings , was from Piedmont , and the coach had invited Rawlings ' youngest daughter , Logan , to join his team . The program would end up based largely in Piedmont . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Lynne Harris and their gaggle of kids were living in the Modesto area at the time , so shuttling to and from the East Bay became a considerable piece of their lives . Soon , Lynne and Larry began to talk about moving to the Bay Area . <p> " When I started bringing the kids over to Piedmont , I fell in love with the community , " Lynne said . " The more I went there , the better I liked it . And then I started checking out the school . . . and I thought , ' Geez , how do I get my kids into this school ? ' " <p> She quickly found out , though , that she and Larry could n't afford to buy a home there , nor was there much available or affordable to rent  --  and what little there was was n't big enough for their family of seven . Lynne said she looked for other options . <p> Finally , last March , as the girls were leading Modesto Christian into the Division V state title game , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enrolling the kids at Deer Valley High . <p> But a month after the state championship , Lynne told the Modesto Bee the family was moving to Piedmont , partly to help cut down on Larry 's commute to Menlo Park and to increase everybody 's time together . She said the family would be living in a house about a mile from school and the kids could walk home every day . <p> What she did n't say , though  --  and what became fodder for prep Web sites and the girls basketball community and later cause for concern at Cal  --  was that Rawlings was renting them his childhood home : a four-bedroom , 2 1/2-bathroom , 2,323-square-foot house , according to property records , that sits well up in the hills . <p> " They 're in my house because they are my friends , lifelong friends , and they are wonderful people , " said Rawlings , who said he would not otherwise be renting out the property . <p> A house like that in a neighborhood like that  --  where $1 million residences are the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month and more likely closer to $4,000 , according to two real estate agents who work the Piedmont area . One four-bedroom , two-bath , 2,383-square-foot home in the area recently was advertised for rent at $5,500 per month . <p> So how could Lynne and Larry Harris afford to move their family to Piedmont ? Lynne runs a nonprofit that helps prospective college athletes manage community , home , academic and athletic issues , and Larry works as a night foreman for a company that stripes highways . <p> " Everything is above board and legal , let 's put it that way , " Lynne said . " Because I do n't think I owe the community ( an explanation of ) how much I pay in a lease . We definitely pay for the property that we rent , and with the most complete integrity based on our friendship . " <p> The rumors , offers and innuendo have followed the Paris twins and their mom virtually since the girls started playing club basketball . <p> Not only were they bigger from the start , they were better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Courtney started competing against girls . To that point , they were either battling against their brothers or playing on boys teams . <p> " Whenever they played on boys teams , there was gon na be resentment , " Larry Harris said . " Especially when a boy would get his shot blocked by Courtney or Ashley . You know , they just could n't handle that . " <p> When Anger first saw the twins in 1999 , his East Bay Xplosion summer program was in only its second year . He figured the girls were at least 14 but was pleasantly surprised to find they were just 11 . <p> Soon , they joined his squad , forging a relationship that helped them become two of the top young girls prospects in the country . By the time the twins were 14 , Anger had put together a team that won the 14-and-under AAU national championship . <p> But along with the success and the exposure , the club scene also exposed Lynne Harris and her kids to a burgeoning environment of opportunities and gossip . <p> Lynne @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quest to provide her kids with the best possible education . The pursuit has meant changing schools several times , and with those changes , the whispers always have tagged along . <p> They were moving for basketball . They were recruited . They got this inducement , they got that inducement . <p> Not that the offers were n't there for the taking . Lynne says she received several invitations every year to have her daughters change AAU teams . <p> " ( They would say ) , ' If you play for us , you do n't have to pay for anything , ' " Lynne said . " Like I taught my kids from Day 1 , there are no free rides . You pay one way or another . " <p> That did n't stop people from talking , though , and when Lynne and Larry decided about a year ago to leave Riverbank ( near Modesto ) for the Bay Area , the move set off a flood of activity and chatter in the girls basketball community . <p> There were offers from various schools @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " There was one school that went all out to get Ashley and Courtney , and I have absolutely no respect for it , " said Lynne , who would not elaborate other than to say the school was private and in the Bay Area . <p> But even after Lynne and Larry settled on Piedmont in April of last year , the talk did n't die down . There was even a wild rumor that Rawlings bought them a $1 million home . <p> Lynne Harris told Cal about her family 's friendship with Ken Rawlings after her son David committed to play for the Bears . She initially indicated to The Chronicle that she informed Cal officials of the rental arrangement after it was made , but she later said that was n't the case . <p> It was n't until mid-January that the Cal athletic department knew the Harrises were renting a home from Rawlings . <p> " We basically heard through the grapevine , " said Foti Mellis , Cal 's associate athletic director for compliance . <p> NCAA rules can be fairly amorphous . Often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those both can be highly subjective . And , for the most part , the college governing body does not act as investigator ; it leaves that to individual schools , which essentially police themselves and report any transgressions . <p> In this case , the two families had what the NCAA terms a pre-existing relationship , which means the friendship predated the relationship between the school and the athletes it was recruiting . That affords some flexibility in providing benefits , but the benefits must remain relatively constant in value . <p> Rawlings disputed the claims by two real estate agents that the rental value of a property like his would be well over $3,000 a month . He also said the issue was irrelevant because he was not acting as a recruiter for Cal and had no interest in where the twins attended college , save for his own self-interest in getting to watch them play . <p> Sources at both Cal and the Pac-10 Conference say the general impression is that Rawlings was more interested in getting the girls to Piedmont than to Cal  --  a point that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Harris said her family enlisted an independent real estate agent who assessed the lease and determined that , " What we pay in dollar value as well as our responsibilities to the place are well-above fair market value . " <p> But Cal , already walking on eggshells because of its probationary status , quickly took action . As soon as athletic department officials learned of the rental agreement , they contacted the Pac-10 enforcement department , which in turn contacted the NCAA . Over the next few days , Cal conducted its own inquiry , interviewing the Harrises and Rawlings and seeking real estate information from agents and the Internet . <p> Cal then recommended to the NCAA an adjustment in the deal , with an increase in rent on the house and a retroactive payment to cover the past eight months or so . Mellis declined to give details , as did Harris . <p> " We went overboard on this one , " said Mellis , who said the school acted swiftly primarily to ensure David 's continued eligibility because the men 's season was ongoing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could have spent even more time . " <p> Still , there was one item overlooked in all of this : Kuchen . Nobody seemed to know about his work with the Piedmont girls team  --  not Cal , not the Pac-10 , not the NCAA . Kuchen , the former Cal coach , said his ties are not only to the Bears but to Yale , Notre Dame and Iowa , where he also previously coached . <p> " Wow , I did n't even know that , " Mellis said of Kuchen 's job as a Piedmont assistant . " That is interesting . But that would not affect it . . . . That 's never come up in any conversations , but that does n't bother me . " <p> As for the rental adjustment , Mellis said Cal reserves the right to appeal its own recommendation at a later date.Chronicle researcher Laura Perkins contributed to this report . / E-mail Mark Fainaru-Wada at **29;10014;TOOLONG
