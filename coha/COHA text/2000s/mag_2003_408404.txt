Even the lowliest of pets can teach a dad a thing or two by Greg Daugherty // the cashier gave me a sympathetic look as she weighed my plate from the salad bar . It came in at well under an ounce . She must have thought I was on the cruelest diet ever . But the lone lettuce leaf and dab of shredded carrot were n't for me . They 'd be dinner for my daughter 's pets . Some families have dogs , cats , or tropical fish . We had snails . I 'm pretty sure that fetching takeout for invertebrates was n't in the job description when I signed on to become a dad . But fatherhood is nothing if not full of surprises . Our little gastropods came from Megan 's kindergarten class . For a year the kids had watched them grow , learned their slimy habits , and even raced them occasionally . Then , when the school year ended , the beloved mollusks were put up for adoption . Megan begged and begged . Although my wife and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair . The snails came with a sheet of instructions that told us how to care for them and what to do if we no longer wanted to . If that happened , we learned , we could just stick them in the freezer for a couple of hours before consigning them to the trash . In our state at least , it 's illegal to release snails into the wild because of the damage they might do to the environment . So while the forest was n't an option , the icebox was . We bought them a little plastic cage at the pet shop , then furnished it with a carpet of wet paper towels and an assortment of leafy things we hoped would keep them alive . Given that even the most robust of houseplants stands about a fifty-fifty chance in our household , we were by no means certain of success . Within a matter of days , the first casualty reports from other adoptive families began to come in . Some snails had starved when their young owners forgot to feed them ; others had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ice trays and frozen vegetables . Ours , however , lived on . In fact , by the end of the year , the snail population in our house had doubled , and we now had four of the surprisingly healthy little things . Just as our parents always told us they would end up caring for any creature we wanted to bring home , so it came to pass in our household . Megan decided she was best suited to the role of recreation director , playing with the snails when we took them out for a little exercise . Scrubbing dried slime off the cage and bringing home the lettuce ( and remembering to give it to them ) , however , became Daddy 's job . Snails are an acquired taste , even as pets , but in time they won me over too . On Sunday nights , while I cleaned their cage and replaced the previous week 's wilted food supply , I would put them on a paper plate and watch them crawl about . I learned to tell them apart ( I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Megan named Adventure was the party animal , always moving around the cage looking for a good time . Another spent so many days in his shell that we had to dip him in a glass of warm water now and then just to make sure he was still alive . On the Internet I learned that snails need calcium to keep their shells in good repair . So I 'd painstakingly grind up eggshells with a mortar and pestle until they were the consistency of dust and then sprinkle the powder in their cage . The Internet also informed me that snails have a life expectancy of up to 10 , and in some cases 15 , years . That meant my wife and I might still be caring for them even after Megan was out of college . And if they kept reproducing at this rate , we could find ourselves moving their slime-trailing descendants into a retirement community with us someday . Alas , our snails were not destined to set any longevity records . After about two years , one of the original pair shriveled up until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before long , we were down to a single snail . Megan and her little brother , Jeffrey , drew pictures of snails to prop up outside the cage . They thought that would keep him from getting lonely and maybe encourage him to hang in there . But pretty soon he , too , had gone the way of his comrades , shriveling up and leaving behind nothing but the round , whorled home he used to carry on his back . I cleaned the cage one last time and stowed it on a shelf in the garage . Megan cried a little , and I rarely went by the salad bar without thinking of them . It was n't just that these gentle animals had died but that another episode of my daughter 's childhood , and of my fatherhood , was over . Then one day Jeffrey came home from school with a note in his backpack and a pleading look in his eyes . His kindergarten class 's snails were ready for adoption . My wife and I looked at each other , remembering the constant scrubbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the salad bar , the added burden in lives already overstuffed with commitments and obligations . We told Jeffrey we 'd take a pair . Author Affiliation Greg Daugherty is a columnist for The Times , a regional newspaper in Westchester County , NY . // <p>
