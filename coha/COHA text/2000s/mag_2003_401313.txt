OUT THERE Headnote Resolving the details of the cosmic microwave background has brought new precision to our picture of the cosmos . // For the first third of a million years or so after the big bang , matter and energy in the universe moved in lockstep . Wherever matter was relatively dense , so was energy . Then , as space expanded enough to accommodate the independent motions of material particles and of photons of light energy , the two gradually extricated themselves from their mutual grip . By the end of that process , matter could move and coalesce on its own , forming planets and stars , as well as galaxies , clusters , and superclusters . Light , on the other hand , simply radiated outward in its original configuration , permeating the expanding universe with a warm , omnipresent glow . That glow has steadily faded and cooled ever since , diffusing through ever-expanding space . The temperature of the space-filling radiation ( about 3,000 degrees Celsius when light and matter separated ) has by now cooled to a frosty 2.7 degrees above @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just another way of saying that the average wavelength of the radiation is no longer fairly short , like the glow of a blast furnace , but much longer , about the same length as the microwaves picked up by an ordinary radio . Astronomers call that radiation the cosmic microwave background , or CMB . In fact , if you tune your radio between two AM stations , about 10 percent of the static you hear is the hiss of the CMB . In spite of the expansion of the CMB , it has remained otherwise unchanged . By contrast , the structure of the matter in the universe has changed dramatically . The CMB , then , is essentially a partial picture of the universe in its infancy . Not surprisingly , we astronomers have been mapping it for decades , as precisely as our technology allows , hoping to uncover the secrets it has preserved for nearly all of cosmic time . The results of our latest effort-by the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe ( WMAP ) - made headlines this past February , when cosmologists unveiled the most detailed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discoveries reported , one number stood out . WMAP had enabled cosmologists to measure the present age of the universe with unprecedented precision : 13,700,000,000 years . But what the news reports did n't emphasize was that-though astronomers obviously care how old the universe might be-arriving merely at that number would not have justified all the time , effort , and resources that went into WMAP . Increasingly accurate observational and theoretical efforts to measure and deduce the age of the universe have been going on for a long , long time ; one more measurement is , at this point , just one more measurement . What 's really exciting is that the cosmic microwave background hides , within its fossilized patterns of light and dark , evidence of many of the fundamental parameters of the universe-its matter density , its energy density , its rate of expansion , and more . From those parameters , astronomers can infer key details about the earliest moments of the cosmos , and derive a wealth of other properties , including its present age , as well as its geometric curvature and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CMB were as impressive and sophisticated as one would expect of a multi-year , multimillion-dollar project . The WMAP results were announced February 11 , and on that day alone , thirteen papers describing the mission were submitted for publication . Six of those are primarily devoted to the technical details of data extraction . In a nutshell , WMAP scans the sky continuously from the vantage of one of the Earth 's Lagrange points see " The Five Points of Lagrange , " by Neil deGrasse Tyson , April 2002 , mapping patterns of hot and cold in the CMB across the entire sky twice each year . That is no mean feat : the hottest and coldest parts of the CMB differ in temperature by roughly four ten-thousandths of a degree . ( That 's like measuring sand-size bumps on a perfectly flat living-room floor . ) To achieve that level of precision , WMAP simultaneously measures the CMB temperature of two widely separated patches of sky , then subtracts one from the other . The process enables the satellite to cancel out any contaminating background signals and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cold patches with the highest possible contrast . The ultimate goal is to determine the direct imprint of the structure of the nascent universe on the CMB . So what 's the bottom line ? Before the WMAP results , the general scientific consensus was that the universe was between 11 billion and 15 billion years old . Now , we 're pretty sure that the universe is between 13.4 billion and 13.9 billion years old . The increased accuracy of the result is certainly welcome : it 's a strong , independent confirmation of previous measurements , and it sinks another strong pillar into the foundation-or is it the firmament%-of modern cosmology . But the measurement does n't really change any basic scientific conclusions . And ironically , that 's what many of my colleagues feel is WMAP 's main contribution : it has confirmed most of what we already suspected about the cosmos , and has lent more precision to what has been a rather inexact science . So , in a way , the really exciting part of this discovery may be that it 's hardly exciting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Hayden Planetarium and a research scientist at Barnard College in New York City . // <p>
