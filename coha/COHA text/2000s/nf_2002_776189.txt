ANTHRAX IN // THE CAPITOL // Bioterrorism Hits Home // For two hours that morning , we talked about bioterrorism in hypothetical terms . Now , suddenly , it was all too real . // An Associated Press reporter asked me to respond to the news that a letter containing anthrax had been delivered to the Washington office of my colleague , Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle . An undetermined number of staffers in Senator Daschle 's Hart Senate Office Building suite had apparently been exposed to the potentially lethal biological agent when the letter was opened . President George W. Bush just minutes before had told the nation about the letter during informal remarks following an event at the White House . // I was stunned . I had spent the morning hosting a roundtable on bioterrorism at the Tennessee Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Nashville . I listened carefully as about three dozen doctors , nurses , hospital administrators , firefighters , police , and other law enforcement , public health , and emergency personnel from all across the state talked about how unprepared they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know at the time that this initial press question would be my initiation into seven days that would severely test much of what we thought we knew about bioterrorism . Seven days that would challenge our fundamental clinical understanding of anthrax  --  how to diagnose it , how to treat it , how to protect those who may have been exposed  --  and how to communicate with the press and the public about a public health emergency with shifting facts and a fluid , rapidly evolving scientific knowledge base . // The coming week also would bring sharply into focus the vital role our public health system plays in responding to such an attack . After all , this was part of the first biological attack on U.S. soil involving anthrax and was only the second known biological attack in the United States in at least a century ( the first , in 1984 , involved salmonella poisoning of restaurant salad bars by a cult in Oregon ) . // The lessons learned from the abstract discussions in Nashville on Monday morning , October 15 , 2001 , would come alive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next seven days . // Monday // As I prepared to host the bioterrorism roundtable in Nashville , a Florida man already had died of inhalational anthrax , and an assistant to NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw had been diagnosed with skin , or cutaneous , anthrax . An additional case of each form of the infectious disease would be confirmed later in the day . // So everyone in that room knew that the threat we once considered remote was growing . Frontline responders , those who will answer that panicky phone call or first see a person with symptoms , lacked appropriate training and protective equipment . State and county public health laboratories lacked adequately trained epidemiologists and state-of-the-art facilities and equipment . Community hospitals had no system to share information with each other or with local public health facilities in a timely way . // Vanderbilt Hospital  --  one of Tennessee 's premier teaching and referral hospitals , where I had worked for nine years as a transplant surgeon before coming to the U.S. Senate  --  acknowledged that it did not have a bioterrorism preparedness plan in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this emerging threat . Nor had any of the community hospitals . // From rural doctors to city police and firefighters to state public health officials , all the way up to the governor 's office , the story was the same : They just were n't prepared to respond to what might happen . // Following the conference , I walked into an adjacent room for a press briefing , and the question was no longer about what might happen . It was about what had already happened . // When asked about the Daschle letter , I simply replied that I was unaware of the report but that it would have to be confirmed . To be honest , I minimized it a bit in my own mind because I recalled receiving an anthrax hoax letter three years before . If the report was correct , this would be the first witnessed exposure of multiple people to the release of airborne anthrax . // My next scheduled stop was a speech about bioterrorism to the Nashville Rotary Club at a downtown restaurant . Ironically , I had picked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before anthrax was on anyone 's radar screen . // By the time I arrived at the Rotary meeting , we had been notified that my own Public Health Subcommittee staff was on the same floor in the Hart building just down the hallway from where the letter had been opened . We were told that there was apparently a large amount of a powdery substance in the letter and that nasal swab testing and distribution of a short course of antibiotics had begun for those in the Daschle suite . I sensed that the issue was escalating . // I was able to get periodic progress reports by telephone from my subcommittee staff . At this point , the Hart building remained open and people were still at work at their desks . In fact , the building would stay open for another day and a half . The risk of exposure was unknown at the time . // I returned to Washington that afternoon and was asked by Senate Republican leader Trent Lott to be the liaison for the Republican senators to the fledgling medical and law enforcement investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Already , those within Senator Daschle 's suite had been given nasal swab tests along with a three-day course of antibiotics . And a public health command room had been set up by Majority Leader Daschle in the secretary of the Senate 's office on the third floor of the Capitol . It was in this room that data were reported and shared and strategies to deal with the evolving public health and environmental issues were discussed and developed . // Officials representing many agencies  --  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) , the Capitol physician 's office , the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( DARPA ) , the Senate sergeant at arms , the Capitol police , Senate leadership , the deputy surgeon general representing the Department of Health and Human Services , and the director of the District of Columbia health department  --  were almost always in that room for the next several days , coordinating among themselves and then reporting back to their home agencies . // To provide information to the Senate staff and the public at large , we held two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daily press conferences for the next week . But many staffers were still confused and anxious about their potential health risk . // Just a few doors from Senator Daschle 's suite , my own health subcommittee staff members were experiencing firsthand the difficulty in obtaining helpful information during a public health emergency . Although they knew about the letter , primarily from press reports , almost nothing else was reaching them . Like the rest of the nation outside the walls of the building , their principal source of information was TV. // On that first day , staffers from Senator Daschle 's offices turned to our health subcommittee staff with questions about anthrax and their own health risk , in part because they knew that my staff had been working on issues related to bioterrorism for a long time and in part because , as I am the Senate 's only doctor , they knew that my staff and I are involved in most health-related issues . Is anthrax contagious ? If I 've been exposed , is my family at risk ? However , no official word came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when a police officer visited my staff in the Hart building to confirm that a letter possibly laced with anthrax had been delivered to Senator Daschle 's office . // In response , they were closing off a section of the Hart building . The officer would remain on duty outside my staff 's door , but the primary reason was to ensure that the press did not bother them as they continued to work . Staffers moved in and out of that wing of the Hart building , totally unaware of any health concerns . // The ventilation system had been shut down within an hour of the incident to avoid potential spread of anthrax , and the staff was told to expect the offices to be warmer than usual . At that time , there was no discussion about their own health risk , and previous experience would suggest that they were not in harm 's way . // Nasal swabs to determine how widespread exposure to the anthrax spores had been were eventually obtained from everyone in the Hart building . On Monday , only those present in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened were given preventive antibiotics pending results of the nasal swab tests . // When nasal swab test results confirmed the direct exposure to anthrax of twenty-eight people inside or immediately adjacent to the Daschle suite , anxiety across Capitol Hill soared . The innocent opening of a letter , a routine task that is done millions of times every day in offices across the country , suddenly escalated into a public health crisis that truly frightened many people who work on the Hill . Congressional mail was quarantined , and a month later , on November 16 , 2001 , a second anthrax-laced letter  --  this one addressed to Sen. Patrick Leahy  --  was discovered by government investigators . // Few of the office workers on that first day really understood what a positive nasal swab meant . What about those whose tests came back negative ? Did they have anything to worry about ? Why did some of them still have to take antibiotics ? It seemed so confusing to everyone involved , including members of the press who were trying to interpret it all . // Anxiety was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And it was only just beginning . // Tuesday // Staff members who had continued working in their fifth- and sixth-floor Hart offices through Monday were surprised the next morning to find a police barricade barring the entrance to the southeast corridor . They were told that they could not return to their offices and were directed to obtain a nasal swab test and more information from the medical crew . // Hundreds and hundreds of concerned individuals lined up for the nasal swab tests in the Hart building . It was difficult for the necessary medical supplies to be maintained . Several times , the line stalled owing to lack of the antibiotic ciprofloxacin ( Cipro ) or the necessary sterile cotton swabs . Anyone who wanted testing simply had to show up ; no one was turned away . Hundreds of people from all over Capitol Hill came to be tested , even if they were not in the Hart building . Many people showed up to be tested out of confusion , others out of fear . // Everyone receiving a nasal swab that day was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the test results ; at that time they would be told whether they would have to take the antibiotics for sixty days . Because of all the confusion , misinformation floating around , and the fact that very little information was then being made available , my staff and I immediately went to work to make the official Senator Bill Frist website a central place where anyone could go to find accurate , up-to-date , pertinent information both on anthrax generally and on the rapidly evolving situation in the Senate office buildings . // It was not the first time my office had to deal with bioterrorism . Three years earlier , after I received the hoax letter labeled " ANTHRAX , " I addressed with my staff mail-handling protocols for any letter that appeared suspicious . We were able to go back and find these protocols and post them immediately on the website so everyone had access to the information . We were among the first sites  --  even before the postal service  --  to have practical information on what to do if you received mail suspicious for anthrax . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation , my staff gathered information from the command-room briefings and continually updated the postings . It was obvious that people were growing anxious for information about anthrax and developments on the Hill . // They tried to get on the CDC website , but it had crashed and no information was available on it . Where could they go to get information about their own personal health risk ? Were the twenty-eight people who tested positive now infected with the most deadly form of anthrax disease , inhalational anthrax ? ( They were n't . The test merely confirmed that they had been exposed to the spores . ) Why did some people around them have positive test results while their results were negative ? How long would they be out of their offices ? Should they go to work the next day ? // People were desperate for information . And desperation can lead to frustration . And frustration can lead to anger . And they did n't know where to turn . // Wednesday // Forty-eight hours after the anthrax-laced letter was opened , information was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the testing site was moved to the Russell Senate Office Building because the Hart building was closed . // As thousands of Senate and House staff and those who had been visiting Senate buildings on Monday lined up for their nasal swabs and three-day Cipro supply , my staff busily printed out information on anthrax exposure that we gathered from my Senate website and others and handed it out to those who waited in line . They were understandably eager for information . // The Senate and House leadership met early Wednesday morning and received reports that environmental cultures from several locations had tested positive for anthrax , suggesting an even higher potential for contamination than previously thought . Decisions were made independently by the House and Senate leadership to close their respective office buildings to allow more comprehensive testing . // When the Senate leadership presented the decision to the full membership , though , they learned that senators felt strongly that their session on Thursday should go on as scheduled . During the meeting , I briefly addressed my colleagues , offering my views from a medical standpoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reassure many of them . // After hearing from officials involved in the investigation , several senators made it clear that they believed Senate business should not be stopped , because it would be a sign of giving in to the terrorists . At the time , most felt that the events occurring on the Hill were likely related to the September 11 attacks . This was , many believed , round two of the assault on the nation 's capital . A plane had struck the Pentagon and killed 189 . Another that crashed in Pennsylvania , killing 44 , almost certainly was headed for Washington . And now , many thought , came deadly anthrax , aimed at the highest-ranking member of the U.S. Senate . // In the end , we decided to close the Senate office buildings later that day but to stay in session in the Capitol building itself on Thursday . House members , in a separate meeting , decided to close their office buildings and to adjourn . The press made a big deal about the House leaving and the Senate staying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accusations flying back and forth , mostly fueled by the press . // To me , this just reflected an initial miscommunication between the House and the Senate at the leadership level , in large part arising from the lack of certainty surrounding the interpretation of environmental culture results that were slowly coming back . Apparently , House and Senate leaders had left the earlier morning meeting with different understandings as to what they would do regarding closing the buildings . Policy decisions that could affect the safety of personnel had to be made on the basis of incomplete information and inadequate science . Such is the nature of bioterrorism. // ( Continues ... ) //
