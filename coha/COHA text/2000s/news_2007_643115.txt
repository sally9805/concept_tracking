<p> Kurt Thometz got to the brownstone on 160th Street first , but a woman who designed lingerie came with more . " The underwear lady , she had $2 million in her purse , or so the broker told me , " he said . " Maybe what that actually meant is that she did n't need a mortgage . " <p> At that point , the ordinary arc of life in New York called for Mr. Thometz  --  a man so passionate about rare and obscure books that he has spent his life happily making a modest living trading in them  --  to forget the brownstone and hunt down a good-sized closet that he , wife , son and books could afford . <p> Off he wandered , finding nothing . One day , though , he passed the brownstone , still unsold . The underwear lady had gone away . He saw the woman of the house , Bun-Ching Lam , on the stoop . <p> " Your husband is a rare book dealer , and so am I , " Mr. Thometz remembered saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You must meet him , " she said . <p> Down the stairs came the husband , Gunnar Kaldewey , a maker of fine art books . Mr. Thometz gave him a copy of an acclaimed anthology of Eastern Nigerian market literature he had edited in 2001 . <p> Over embossed endpapers , they bonded . " I 'll entertain your bid for the house , " Mr. Kaldewey told him . <p> Mr. Thometz went to the bank , but came back short of the asking price . <p> In that moment , love  --  ferocious , unmanageable , deliriously **25;158;TOOLONG love  --  conquered even the Manhattan real estate market . <p> " Gunnar gave us a second mortgage so I could do it , " Mr. Thometz said . " That it is still a haven of books means a lot to him . " <p> And so , in defiance of the end of reading and the printed word , in the teeth of the empire of chain stores that stretches to every corner of the retail world , the pilgrimage of Kurt Thometz has carried him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the northern tip of Harlem . <p> Mr. Thometz has tended the serious private libraries of Brooke Astor and Diana Vreeland , Leonard Lauder , Felix Rohatyn and various Newhouses , and others of such staggering wealth that an interior decorator could summon him to provide a collection with only one specification : " 53 feet of books bound in forest green . " <p> Now he presides at Jumel Terrace Books ( jumelterracebooks.com ) on the ground floor of his family 's home at 426 West 160th Street . A sign on the window says , " Open by Invitation , Appointment , or Serendipity . " <p> Mr. Thometz ; his son , Adam ; and his wife , Camilla Hoey , a dress and costume maker , arrived on 160th Street in 2004 with 400 cartons of book , some 10,000 volumes . The specialty is local history and African and African-American literature . <p> They live down the street from the oldest house in Manhattan , the Morris-Jumel Mansion , where Washington , Jefferson and the Adamses dined ; where a woman who grew up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesan without peer , and by dint of shrewd real estate dealings , one of wealthiest women in America . " Eliza Jumel is the grand horizontal story of all time , " Mr. Thometz said . <p> Around the corner is 555 Edgecombe Avenue , home over the years to , among others , Count Basie , Joe Louis , Thurgood Marshall , Coleman Hawkins , Johnny Hodges , Lena Horne , Canada Lee . " It 's one of the most intensely historical places in the United States , " Mr. Thometz said . " It 's the crossroads where the founding fathers met the founding brothers . " <p> Mr. Thometz , 54 , was born in " middle-state Minnesota , " and came to New York in 1972 . " I did n't go to college , I went to Book Row , " he said , working at the Strand , University Place Bookstore and the Madison Avenue Bookshop . <p> He found additional work as the private librarian to rich people  --  some of them serious readers , some of them looking to furnish a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what they were hiring me for , they just knew that Mrs. Vreeland told them to , " Mr. Thometz said . <p> Some clients had very particular interests . At the request of a professional dominatrix , he said , he provided a set of the Marquis de Sade , bound in black leather with fetish strappings . " Butched out , " Mr. Thometz said . " She was a Dante scholar as well . " <p> Adam , a son from his first marriage , had autism , accompanied by its common side effect , divorced parents . Adam lived with Mr. Thometz and Ms. Hoey in Brooklyn Heights when 9/11 sent them all into a tailspin . <p> " There was no call for what I did for a long time , " he said . Two years later , they were bailed out : Ms. Hoey got a call from Celine Dion , who needed costumes for a Las Vegas extravaganza , three shows a day , seven days a week , 30 dancers , with changes . <p> In the ground floor parlor on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century over there . On this shelf , slavery , many oral histories ; sports , jazz , street literature , narcotics , black military history . Bound volumes of Muhammad Speaks . Vinyl records of speeches by Malcolm X and Eldridge Cleaver . A signed Langston Hughes volume . Bruce Davidson 's photos of 100th Street . Mr. Thometz had a very good day last month at the Harlem Book Fair , when 40,000 people visited 145th Street . <p> THE passion for books survives . He has a story about that . By the age of 5 , Adam had not yet spoken an intelligible word  --  not Mommy , not Daddy , not milk or no . Mr. Thometz read to him every night for two and a half years . With Adam in the crook of his arm , the weight of the day on him , Mr. Thometz was reading Thomas the Tank Engine for the 200th time . <p> " Henry the engine , " he read . <p> " Green , " Adam interrupted . <p> Yes : the proper name was Henry the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He supplied it , " Mr. Thometz said . " It was the first time he had used a word on purpose . " And it was the first rung on the ladder he climbed from his isolation . Today , Adam , 16 , entertains friends , plays music , and is thriving . <p> And now , long after the summer days have given way to dusk , a glow spills from the ground-floor window of the brownstone on 160th Street . Four letters seem to float in the window , cutting a silhouette into the light from the bookshop beyond . <p> " WORD , " it says. ##
