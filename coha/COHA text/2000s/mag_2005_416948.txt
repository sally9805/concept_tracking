Photograph far left : Soak up sunshine on Smathers Beach-the best public beach in Key West . // President Harry S Truman once said , " I have a notion to move the capital to Key West and just stay . " After visiting the nation 's southernmost town , who would n't want to pack it up and make this magical place home ? Especially this time of year when the temperate 75-degree days are followed by 65-degree evenings . U.S. 1 runs 150 miles south from Miami , ending at this enchanted island-a scant 2 miles long and 4 miles wide-surrounded by sparkling blue waters . Pastel-colored Victorian homes , which look more like overgrown dollhouses than residences , line streets barely wide enough for a single car . Violet orchids grow from the sturdy trunks of towering palm trees , while green ivy climbs on rickety picket fences . On one corner , free-range chickens and their chirpy tagalongs harmonize with a street musician playing Jimmy Buffett 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ top : Enjoy an outdoor lunch of shrimp and crab cakes at Grand Caf , above : Key West is known for its artists and galleries , left : Many homes here are listed on the National Register of Historic Places . // In Key West , there 's no such word as " weird .

Meander down raucous Duval Street wearing a magenta tutu , balancing a green parrot on your crown , and nary a soul will flinch . My husband and I made a date to escape to this fanciful place . Here 's a 12-hour diary of our adventures in Key West . See you there ! 9 a.m. - Rumbling stomachs pull us from our comfortable slumber . We follow the clucking chickens to iconic Blue Heaven , where fresh shrimp or lobster Benedict tempts even the person who normally skips breakfast . We ask our Key West-native waitress what our first sight in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can learn a lot about Key West just by reading tombstones . " She tells us to look for headstones reading " I told you I was sick , " " I 'm just resting my eyes , " and " Devoted Fan of Julio Iglesias . " Of course we take her advice and meander through the quiet resting place . 10 a.m. - After an hour in Key West , we decide this quirky place feels like a nation of its own . Fittingly , it is . Key West belongs both to the Conch Republic and the U.S. This sovereign nation , named for the popular sea critter , was born on April 23 , 1982 , in response to a U.S. Border Patrol blockade of the Florida Keys . We head to the office of the secretary-general to obtain a souvenir passport . 11 a.m-Knowing that Key West is the past and present home to a slew of literary and artistic geniuses , we decide to follow a walking tour of their homes . The best-known resident was , of course , Ernest Hemingway . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and eye first editions of his books . Other literary figures of Key West include Shel Silverstein , Tennessee Williams , and Elizabeth Bishop . Noon-We 're ready to eat again . We walk from Hemingway 's pad to Grand Caf , a popular eatery on Duval Street . In honor of Key West , we share a chilled shrimp cocktail appetizer and then order heaping fresh fish sandwiches . We watch the colorful characters of this town stroll down the street while we refuel . 1 p.m. - Ready for our afternoon siesta , we drive to Smathers Beach , the best public beach in Key West . It sits on the Atlantic and runs along South Roosevelt Boulevard between the airport and Bertha Street . Equipped with oversize beach towels for lounging , we crack open books as we soak up some Florida rays . 2 p.m. - The allure of art calls , so we dust off our sandy toes to explore a few galleries in town . We start at KW Light Gallery where Sharon Wells shows her colorful paintings and photographs of Key West houses and flowers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gallery . We fall in love with her sculptured metal geckos . Barbara tells us our next stop should be The Chicken Store . " Can we walk there ? " we ask . She says , " I 've lived here for eight years and have never driven a car . " 3 p.m. - Chickens roam free all over the island . At The Chicken Store , we discover why . Owner Katha Sheehan tells us about the Rooster Rescue Team . The volunteer group takes in orphaned peeps , nurses sick and wounded ones , and relocates unwanted chickens . To support the cause , we buy yellow " Save the Chickens " T-shirts . 4 p.m. - Armed with Conch Republic passports and chicken T-shirts , we investigate the island 's shopping . Our first stop is Bsame Mucho , where we marvel over the French soaps and interior decorating items in this boutique . We then see Fast Buck Freddie 's standing out from the many souvenir shops on Duval . We drool over the bamboo furnishings and silk tropical shirts in this local department store .

The actual setting of the sun is only a portion of this daily ritual at Mallory Square . We also spy street artists , fire-eaters , break-dancers , and jumping cats . 6 p.m. - Giddy from the excitement of Mallory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marquesa , to unwind . The lights in the tall palm trees reflect against the crystal blue pool waters in the back of this 27-room hotel . We agree that this may be the prettiest place we 've ever stayed . 7 p.m. - Not ready to leave the hotel yet , we visit the on-site restaurant , Caf Marquesa . Our server starts us with glasses of wine and brings a heaping basket of bread and a plate of homemade hummus to the table . After one bite of our perfectly prepared tuna steaks , we know that we made the right decision in dining here . 8 p.m. - Full from the heavenly meal , we walk off dinner with a stroll on Duval Street ( better known as Doing the Duval Crawl ) . This main street of Key West attracts every sort of character this town has to offer . We feel a bit like Ma and Pa Kettle in the big city for the first time as we absorb sights we 've never experienced before . Then we remember that here nothing is weird , and we simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West would be complete without a taste of the dessert this area calls its own . We break all diet rules , stop at a walk-up cafe , and order slices of chocolate-dipped Key lime pie on a stick . We feel a bit naughty eating sweets at this hour but decide that in this town late-night splurges are a must . In fact , we think Key West would be disappointed if we did n't .
