How many Freudians does it take to change a light bulb ? Two . One to change the bulb , and one to hold the penis ... I mean ladder ! Although Sigmund Freud is n't exactly famous for his sense of humor , he actually liked jokes  --  in fact , he wrote a book about them , Jokes and Their Relation to the Unconscious . But he probably would n't have liked that one . Freudian psychoanalysis was one of the great innovations of the 20th century , and only 50 years ago , it was a mainstay of mental-health care . But since then it has gone from a medical and cultural institution to the punch line of a mildly dirty joke told by psychiatry residents . The members of the American Psychoanalytic Association today treat fewer than 5,000 patients in the U.S. How did the treatment Freud called the " talking cure " fall from grace ? And now that it has fallen , can it get up again ? <P> For almost a century , Freud 's followers have treated his techniques like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his theories to compete with new drugs and new therapies , even if it means using methods that would have been unthinkable to their patriarch . At the same time , post-Freudian psychotherapists are figuring out that the old master still has something to offer the science of mental health : an understanding of the human mind and its many malfunctions that 's richer , fuller and more exciting than anything invented since . <P> In their time  --  the early decades of the 20th century  --  Freud 's ideas radically and irrevocably changed the way we think about who we are . He both explained the human mind and made it more mysterious . One of Freud 's key insights was to divide the mind into the conscious and the unconscious : he showed us that beneath the surface banality of everyday thoughts and gestures lurk subterranean caverns of forbidden longings that reach all the way back to our earliest childhood memories . Freud 's therapeutic technique , psychoanalysis , was an intellectual exploration of those depths , where patients could confront their deepest , darkest desires . If they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they could return to the surface with a calmer , healthier mind . <P> By the 1920s , psychoanalysis had become wildly popular in America ( a country Freud visited only once and hated ) . Jazz age sophisticates held " Freuding " parties at which they told one another their dreams . Samuel Goldwyn , the movie-studio magnate , offered Freud $100,000 to write a love story that Goldwyn could turn into a motion picture . ( He was rebuffed . ) But Freud died in 1939 , and the golden age of psychoanalysis lasted only until the 1950s . By then competing psychotherapeutic theories and approaches had begun to spring up , among them ego psychology , self-psychology , the object-relations school , interpersonal therapy and existential therapy . All revised Freud , and some rejected him outright .
