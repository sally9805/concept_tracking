DEEP SOUTH SALLY MANN It was with haunting , sometimes sexually charged shots of her children , maturing enigmatically in the Virginia hill country , that Mann first gained notice in the late 1980s . Some years later she moved into territory even more shadowy than the boundary between childhood and adulthood : the Southern landscape . Through darkroom accidents and her use of 19th century glass-plate developing techniques , these pictures come to us fogged , scratched and indistinct , like her portrait of a wounded tree , above . Her mesmerizing book is not so much a portrait of the South as it is a dream about it , with a residue of wonder and longing on every page . <P> SHADOW BOXERS JIM LOMMASSON Boxing gyms do n't have the sheen of health clubs or the cachet of martial-arts dojos . They 're sweatshops , where young men who do n't usually have many prospects in the wider world struggle to make the most of whatever it is that boils in their blood . For 10 years , Lommasson , a photographer based in Portland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poking his camera into the places , like the Fraser Arms in Vancouver , below , where young fighters train . He has plainly got to know them and their coaches well enough to understand the drama and lowdown splendor of their lives . Both up to the minute and timeless , his pictures are also affecting , intricate and sometimes just glorious . <P> ON THIS EARTH NICK BRANDT African wildlife has never looked so regal and mysterious as in Brandt 's grave photographs . His elephants appear as weighty as the pyramids . His rhinos look more ancient than carbon . His apes know something we do n't . Given the multitude of human disasters in africa , is it an indulgence to lose yourself in pictures that carry no hint of the wars and famines outside the frame ? Not when the pictures are such powerful reminders that africa is also a magnificent  --  and endangered  --  treasure house of animal life <P> WOMAN IN THE MIRROR RICHARD AVEDON By the time of his death last year , it was the general view that Avedon was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sometimes the general view gets it exactly right . This endlessly fascinating collection , devoted to pictures of women , makes plain the phenomenal range of his imagination and his deep grasp of what can be said by the human form and face . His high-stepping fashion shots , his cheeky celebrity portraits , his images of grandes dames as they dwindle sublimely into old age  --  not one of them is less than riveting . <P> A PLACE IN THE SUN SLIM AARONS For decades Aarons was a society photographer for magazines like LIFE , Holiday and Town &; Country . He made the jet set look fetching wherever it landed , from Palm Springs to Acapulco . ( That 's French soprano Lily Pons , above , at Cap Ferrat , France . ) Aarons did n't mean to satirize those scrumptious creatures , their opulence or their strangely bewitching narcissism . All the same , it 's hard to turn the pages of this book , brimming with rich folk in full regalia  --  with their silky red slip-ons , their bikinis and their short shorts  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
