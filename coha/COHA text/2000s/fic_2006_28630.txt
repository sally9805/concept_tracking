Magic Time A Novel By Marlette , Doug Farrar , Straus and Giroux Marlette , Doug Troy Carter ransom awoke curled up in the backseat of his sister 's Mercury Grand Marquis . The metronomic ticking of tires against scored pavement penetrated the pharmaceutical fog , and he pushed up on his forearms to look out the window . They were speeding along the interstate that flatlined across the Black Belt of southern Mississippi . " You slept good , " said Sally . He caught her anxious glance in the rearview mirror . He raised himself up until he could see his own reflection . There were dark circles under his eyes , and his jawline was shadowed with stubble , his thick brown hair matted . He still had on the black and gold Vanderbilt sweatshirt his sister had found in a chest of drawers in his apartment in New York and brought to the hospital for him to wear on the trip . It was a present Emily had gotten him for his birthday . " How close are we ? " Carter asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 're almost home . Go back to sleep if you want . " He stretched and looked around . One leg was still numb , and hisback muscles were tight from the long ride south . He felt thirsty but was too weak to open the ice chest on the floorboard beside him to see if there were Cokes inside . Instead he retrieved the pillow he had been resting his head on , gathered it up close to his chest , and sank into the backseat vinyl to stare out the window . The medication made his throat dry and his brain furry . Nausea overcame him as a profound agitation blossomed again in his stomach . " Sally , what 's going on ? " he said . He leaned forward and placed his forehead against the seat back , turning slightly to squint through the glare of the side window at the barren Mississippi landscape whizzing by . " You passed out in the newsroom , remember ? " Sally spoke in a conscientiously neutral tone , as if she were describing the weather . Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the heavy equipment of highway construction , trying to focus on what his sister was saying . " You were in the hospital a few days but checked yourself out .

" He also mentioned symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder . " Carter looked back into the rearview mirror , knowing his sister would be watching for his reaction .

He sat up fully for the first time . " This is a bad idea , Sally . " " You do n't need to be by yourself , Carter , " Sally said with a quiet finality . " You should have left me in the loony bin , " he said . Sally said , " Ashland is not a loony bin . " " You 're right . Troy is the loony bin . " The last time Carter had been back to his hometown of Troy , Mississippi , was a couple of years earlier , when he had taken Josh and Emily on the grand Southern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had seldom returned since his mother died ten years before and he had left the Atlanta paper and moved to New York .

" " But I 've got a life , Sal . Responsibilities . I 've got deadlines --  " " Dennehy said he could manage without you for a while . " As much as Carter cringed at the thought of recuperating in Troy , he knew that once Sally had set a plan in motion , she saw it through . She offered him a bit of her Hershey bar .

" " What is it , a dead end ? " Sally laughed . " You can come to the party if you feel up to it . " Carter forced a smile . " I do n't know how you take care of him . " " Oh , he 's no bother . He 's dialed it back a lot in recent years . You 'll be surprised . He 's a good grandfather to Willie , and Willie 's devoted to him . " Sally 's ex , a tax lawyer , had run , " when you 're a bookseller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house payment is a godsend . " " Thought of hiring a nurse ?

Carter felt an involuntary pang of love/hate when he saw the green exit sign , troy historic district . " How 's business , Sally ? " He knew how hard it was for her to be away from the shop . And although she would never complain , he felt guilty for being the reason she had to take off . " Could be worse . The town 's changed considerably . You 're not going to recognize it . " " That 's reassuring . " " The college is Troy University now , you know . Our generation 's finally grown up and taken over . The mayor 's black , and a couple of council members . There 's even an artists ' collective in Troy . " " Black-velvet Elvises ? Popsicle-stick birdhouses ? " " Ha-ha . There 's also a clique of writers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ write more books than they read . " The conversation had exhausted Carter . He reclined in the seat . Sally had turned off the interstate onto old U.S. Highway 17 , the narrow two-lane blacktop that was the only route north out of town in his youth , before the interstate . It was the road he had traveled with his family on vacations , with his basketball team to games in Meridian or Columbus , with church groups to gospel sings in Jackson , and it was the road that took him away from home to college and law school back when the future had seemed knowable . Except for a few stray billboards promoting products and companies that had not existed in the 1960s , the scenery along the highway remained much as it was during his boyhood -- a corridor of unbroken green cutting through incipient hills of pine forest , giving way occasionally to sunbaked farmland , open fields of soybean , corn , and watermelon , or pastures occupied by melancholy herds of humidity-stunned cattle . The relentless sun seemed to have drained the fields of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chlorophyll to the lush kudzu , which crept up guy wires and draped telephone poles . The highway grew clotted with slow-moving trucks hauling lumber , forcing an adjustment of speed and expectation for miles before one reached the city limits , as if returning to Troy required a slowing of metabolism to the velocity of molasses . As they passed the old Troy Casket Company and its sprawling new facility , Carter caught his first whiff of the changes that had come to his hometown . The company 's whimsical contemporary logo seemed suited more to a wine emporium in Jackson than to the sides of the parked trucks that would deliver their sad cargo all over the Southeast . " Lige has been in town a lot campaigning for reelection , " Sally said as they pulled into view of the town square . " I 'm sure he 'll be coming by to see you . " In Mississippi the past had a way of superimposing itself on the present , and Carter experienced that familiar twinning of realities as he made out the old Kress 's logo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them : a personal landmark . It was now abandoned , a sign on its soaped windows announcing its next tenant , an organic foods market . As they circled the courthouse , Sally said , " Look , Pross . See anything different ? " She pointed toward the street on the south end of the square . Carter scanned the intersection he had known so well as a child , and he spotted the statue erected on a traffic island in the distance , a small cast-bronze figure of a man with one hand lifted heavenward in a gesture of command . " Guess who that is . " " The Imperial Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan . " Sally laughed and groaned . " Oh , Lord , it 's going to be a long convalescence . No , it 's Hugh . Remember how he used to direct traffic in front of the Starlite Cafe ? " Hugh Renfro , the retarded son of a respected local physician , had been a well-known town character , sort of like a gregarious Boo Radley . Hugh was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and speaking for the most part in rhyme . " Hey , pretty girl in your new spring dress , I 'll ask you to marry me and hope you 'll say yes . " " Hugh got hit by a pulpwood truck a couple of years ago , " Sally said . " The whole town turned out for his funeral . The city council voted to put up a statue to him , and I think Dad kicked in some money . They even commissioned the sculpture in Memphis . " Carter took a slow , deep breath . Troy had been the birthplace of at least two world-class athletes -- an Olympic runner and a pro football great -- as well as a famous mezzo-soprano with the Metropolitan Opera . But those local achievers were black , and it had been decades before the hometown named streets after them -- in the historically black district . When the city finally got around to erecting a statue to a native of distinction , it was to a certifiable idiot , who happened to be white . Welcome home to Troy , Mississippi .
