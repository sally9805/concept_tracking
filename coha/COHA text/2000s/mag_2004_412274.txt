Building your own PC ? Here 's how to save some headaches and some dollars . // WHEN JIM DESMOND needed a new PC a few years ago , he figured that he could save a few bucks by building it himself . he was right-but the adventure was n't without other costs . " I spent at least one entire week of evenings just doing research , before I even started building , " says Desmond , manager of information protection at a large financial institution . Since that first try , Desmond has built a dozen more systems for himself and others , and he says that the process has gotten easier each time as he 's gained experience and as parts have become less difficult to assemble . " It used to be sort of like building a car , " says the Cleveland native . " These days it 's more like putting together a cabinet . " Once a hobby of supergeeks , PC building is going mainstream . Stores like Best Buy and CompUSA are playing up their selection of motherboards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and cases . The option of rolling your own PC can be attractive : If everything goes according to plan , you end up with exactly the system you want and maybe save some dough in the process . But of course , things do n't always go according to plan , even for technically savvy users . If you 're on the fence , ask yourself these questions : Will this project be a pleasure or a pain ? If you truly enjoy tinkering with tech toys and chasing down the cause of mysterious error messages , you wo n't mind ( too much ) if a particularly stubborn problem crops up . If you do n't , you could end up with nothing more than an impressive collection of parts , an inflated credit card bill , and a migraine headache . Are you doing it because you 're a cheapskate ? If so , be careful . Building a system from parts can certainly save you some cash , but mostly on midlevel to high-end , highly customized systems . Though you may be able to cobble together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may also find yourself replacing those cheesy components in a few months . If you 're just looking for an inexpensive , reliable machine , you can buy a ready-made one-with a warranty-from many reputable vendors for $500 or less . Do you have plenty of spare time ? Like most do-it-yourself projects , building a computer will probably take at least twice as long as you expect . Experts I spoke with say that first-timers should plan on at least two weeks to properly research , order parts , and build a computer . If you need to be up and running quickly , or if you have other demands on your time ( such as a job , a family , or a houseplant ) building might not make sense for you . Do you mind being your own tech support department ? If the prospect of an inexplicable hardware failure in the middle of the night makes you feel like the mission commander in 2003 : A Space Odyssey after HAL went haywire , think long and hard before you commit to building . Most component manufacturers do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be able to tell whether a particular problem is due to a faulty part or some other incompatibility . And keeping track of the individual warranties for each component can be a headache . BEFORE YOU BUILD IF YOU 'VE DECIDED you were born to build , great . But before you start pricing motherboards , consider the following tips , which I 've culled from a handful of self-builders who 've been there , done that , and learned from their mistakes . They might just save you some ibuprofen . Know what you want . Before you order a single component , decide exactly the system you want , just as you would if you were buying a vendor-built machine . Once you 've figured out what you 'll be using the computer for , you can focus on finding parts that will best fit the bill . Do your homework . Plenty of books , articles , and Web sites out there can help you navigate your way to PC perfection . Rob Williams , a software developer and computer game designer in Longwood , Florida , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after constructing his first PC from scratch . The site offers a cornucopia of advice on everything from choosing components and vendors to avoiding typical newbie problems . Another helpful site is HardwareCentral ( www. hardwarecentral.com ) , which includes pages of easy-to-follow information about all things hardware . For advice on motherboards , see our Spotlight on page 150 . When you 're ready to put the pieces together , last july 's StepBy-Step ( find.pcworld.com/39938 ) can help you with the specifics . And ask friends , family , and coworkers for their two cents ; you may be surprised at how many closet PC builders are out there . Build a budget . And stick to it . After all , one of the reasons to build your own is to save money , right ? Shane Rau , a technology industry analyst and build-it-yourself veteran in PaIo Alto , California , recommends that builders set a budget based on the cost of buying their ideal PC from a commercial PC maker . " Overspending is a common pitfall for first-time builders , " says Rau . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the retail price would be , you 'll be a lot less likely to buy overpriced or unnecessary components . " Buy , but you 'll probably regret it if you do . MySuperPC.com 's Williams considers purchasing bargainbasement components the biggest mistake a new computer builder can make . " I do n't know how many times builders who bought cheap components have asked me why their system wo n't work , " says Williams . " I tell them to ask the outfit they bought it from . " Protect yourself . Check the warranty details on every part you get , and test each component before its warranty expires . " Make sure everything you buy is returnable , " advises PC builder Desmond . Should you attempt to build your own PC ? If you 're prepared to do a lot of work and to deal with some potential frustration , you just might be rewarded with the system of your dreams-along with the satisfaction and knowledge that you 'll gain from having done it yourself . Sidebar PRIVACY WATCH E@4#N or E@4#W ? How to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stored on a hard drive or on the Internet , the only way to maintain your privacy securely is by creating tough passwords and changing them regularly . But how do you dredge up e*TY#$98@ from your already overtaxed brain ? You do n't need to have a perfect memory . Here are a few ways to come up with passwords no one else will guess , but that you 'll be able to recall : Make the password out of the first letter of a list of several words . The list you use can consist of a sentence or perhaps the names of your children , brothers , or favorite football teams , but you can turn any memorable string of words into a memorable password . Robert A. Heinlein did just that in his 1966 novel The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress , when he made up the acronym tanstaaf/irom the first letter of each word in the sentence , " There ai n't no such thing as a free lunch . " Sidebar Turn words into numbers and special characters . Adding anything from the number row @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special characters ) to a password makes it much stronger . For instance , you could turn a memorable pet emergency into the password m3dcacAat ( " My three dogs chased a cat up a tree " ) . Sidebar Blend the letters of two or more words Into one password . Rather than using your mother 's name as a password , you could combine the words mom and Ella into the password Emlo/ma by alternating letters from the two words . Need a new password ? just reverse the letters to make amlolmE . Use password manager software to keep track of your passwords . The tricks identified above will help people with average memories keep a reason- able number of passwords in their heads . But what if you frequently need to buy a vowel just to remember a coworker 's name , or if you have dozens of password-protected accounts ? In such situations , the best option is to use software specifically designed to manage , securely store , and help you use your passwords . Two examples are Password Safe ( find.pcworld.com/ 39599 ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good memory , it 's wise to store your passwords in a password manager , just in case .
