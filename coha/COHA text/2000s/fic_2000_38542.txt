Depending on when this story comes off the presses , Jennifer Vanderbes is or soon will be a graduate of the Iowa Writers " Workshop , where she held a Truman Capote Fellowship . She reports that she was awarded a Wallace Fiction Prize whilst attending Yale University and another story of hers will be published in Best New American Voices 2000 later this year , but this story marks her professional debut . Ms. Vanderbes certainly seems to have a promising future ahead of her ... unlike the narrator of this tantalizing tale of obsessive Love . <p> " MEOW , " SHE TELLS ME , commands from the couch , her legs tucked under her pink cotton skirt . I loosen my tie , plead with my eyes . " Now , " she says . Surrendering , once again , I set my briefcase down , drop to my knees . " Meow , " I say , palms planted on the carpet , rolling my tongue into a Spanish purr . " Here kitty , kitty , " she calls . Her thin lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couch with epileptic frenzy . " Come here kitty . " I smile and arch my back . I crawl rapidly , knees burning from friction , then rub my head against her leg . " Good kitty , " she says , stroking my hair with her bony fingers . " Very good kitty . " Then she produces a cheese cracker with her other hand and gently slides it into my mouth . There are things you should know : I am not a cat . I am a forty-year-old man who has , at times , been a respected professional . I am in love . This is what happened : My boss , a plump jackie Gleason type , came into my office one day , peered down at me through his wire-rimmed glasses and said if I did n't get my act together I might lose my job . I work in corporate real-estate . I had n't made a sale in a while . There was no way to argue it . But then he tried to buddy up , to adopt a locker-room familiarity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to know . He spoke of " aging bachelor anxiety , " said I displayed all the telltale signs . Loneliness . Fatigue . Low self-esteem . Not to worry , he soothed . Even the greatest men - Aristotle , Caesar , Napoleon- surely they went through the same things . ( He confessed an affection for history ) . He assured me I was experiencing a typical-average problem which life would take care of in an over-the-counter way . Get out there , he said . just get out there and live . So on my lunch hour , I did what men in jeopardy of losing their jobs do-I went to a bar . And there , in this dimly lit , sticky-floored saloon was a girl in a plaid skirt sitting at the bar , sipping soda through a red straw . Tight brown curls boiled furiously around her face . Her fingertips rested on the oak lip of the bar . At first , I did n't think she noticed me . But when I passed her , she lifted her pale chiseled face toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was suddenly thankful for all the movies I had seen , the sit-corns that provided me a certain familiarity with this situation that my life had not supplied . I said , " Sure , baby , " and fumbled only slightly before helping her into her red pea-coat and escorting her down the cold street to my car . The drive was short and she was silent . She looked around the car , slid her red pumps over the layer of parking stubs , maps , and wrappers . Out of the corner of my eye I saw her pick up a bubble gum wrapper and slide it into her coat pocket . When we arrived at my house I instinctively dimmed the lights and lowered the blinds . She unbuttoned her pea coat , dropped it on the floor and stood in front of me . " Make love to me , " she said , eyeing my apartment . This is where knowledge failed me . " But how ? " I asked . " Kiss me . Then hold me . Then take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hesitates is lost . " " Ahh , " I sighed , pleased to hear a familiar phrase , " but what about looking before you leap ? " " Always look . Even when you 're standing still . Even when you 're kissing . Now kiss me , " she said . And so I obeyed , pressed my lips against hers with my eyes wide open . And so it began . Since that afternoon , she has remained in my apartment constantly , refusing to come out even for my short evening walks . It appears she either has no place to go or no other place that she wants to be . I do n't ask questions . I am happy she is here , my beautiful baby . The second day she stayed she asked me to buy her cloth and thread and needles . I did . And within a week she had embroidered a sign that says : " Home is where the heart is . " Whenever I offer to take her anywhere , she simply holds this in front of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began demanding Chinese food every night . She would lift her Lo Mein one long noodle at a time , tilt her head back and let it slowly coil into her small mouth . Fried rice was nibbled , grain by grain . She cracked fortune cookies in half as if they were hollow statues hiding treasure . She also wanted bubble gum and baseball cards . I brought it all to her in stuffed paper bags after work . But I had to ask , " What 's it all about ? " " Curiosity , " she said , " killed the cat . " " But there is no cat here , " I said . " Well , get me a cat then . I want a kitty . " I can not say no . She wants a cat and she will make me play cat until I get her one . And of course I will get her one . I can not deny her anything . There is no time . Things began turning around at work . I was negotiating an average of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . Everyone began telling me I looked younger . " What 's different ? " they wanted to know . " We can tell something has changed . " " I 'm in love , " I said . " I have found love . " " Well , love will set you free , " my secretary chuckled . " Love , " my boss added with a wink , " is a many-splendored thing . " " But what is she like ? " they asked . " Tell us about her . " I told them . I told them everything . " It 's crazy ; " I said . " I 'm out of control . I ca n't stop myself . " Half the office shook their heads in confusion and went back to their desks . The other half put their hands on my shoulder and said , " We have been there . My fellow man , we have felt exactly the same thing . " OF COURSE , we are actually getting younger . It was wonderful at first - the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has become a bit unsettling . Because she is much younger , she is actually getting smaller . It does n't seem to bother her so I do n't press the point . She giggles as she stands in front of the mirror each morning and stares at the small berry nipples that remain of her breasts , runs her hands over the flattening curves of her hips . For now , I am only getting firmer , maybe a little sharper around the jaw . But it 's only a matter of time before people start to notice . She has taken a fancy to wearing my shoes around the house . Her thin legs stick like wooden spoons out of the large , black patent leather bowls that she swirls across the floor . As she moves through the apartment she says , " I 'm going to walk a mile before I criticize you . " But I simply smile and watch her with joy because I know she never really criticizes . I came home one day and she was standing ( now barely reaching my chest/ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , my love . " I was anxious , giddy . " What is it ? " " I have written something for you . Here . " She handed me a marble-covered composition book . " It 's a love letter . A poem . A novel , " she said . " All my feelings set to paper . " I opened to page one . Different-sized words were glued down like a ransom note : Truth will meet danger in love soon On the path to Happiness And there was more , much more . " It reads like the purest poetry , " I said . " You have a way with words . " " But I must give credit where credit is due , " she said , pulling a wad of paper scraps from her pocket . They were remnants of fortunes from cookies and bubble gum wrappers . She had cut the words and phrases from the fortunes and pasted them together in the book . " Nobody , " I said , fingering the stiff pages and fighting back tears , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrapped her arms around my waist and said , " You know I would do anything for you . " I felt a pain in my heart . Time is closing in on us . I buy her clothes , increasingly smaller clothes . She sends me to the Junior department with a stack of shiny pages she has torn out of fashion magazines . " Like that , " she says . " Get me things like that . Every color . " But the clothes get big on her so fast it 's difficult to keep up . For a few months , oversized clothing was in fashion and we could slow down on the shopping . And , because she is getting younger and more insecure , she complains whenever I leave the house now . " Out of sight , out of mind , " she cries , grabbing my ankles . " No , " I say . " Distance makes the heart grow fonder . " Then we spend the entire evening sitting on the couch , arguing this point to chicken-egg infinitum , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . I had to go to work today to close a deal and when I came back she was sitting in front of the television . " I want sugar , Daddy , " she said . " There was a movie about us on television and they said the daddy gave the girl sugar . Why do n't you bring me sugar ? " I ran to the kitchen , fumbled in a few cluttered cabinets and found an open box of sugar cubes . When I returned , her small mouth was stretched open with her tongue sticking out . I set the cube right in the middle and watched it melt , a syrup pool spreading in all directions . Then she closed her mouth and put her arms around me . " Thank you , Daddy . " I I am healthier and stronger than I have been in years , but she has gotten so small and vulnerable I can not leave her alone . I 've made calls about baby-sitters . Old world nannies and high school cheerleaders . More than ever I realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am supposed to go to work , to carry this successful stride as far as it will go , but I will not leave her in the care of just anybody . " I 'll be good , " she says . " I promise . I do n't need a baby-sitter . " " But there is danger lurking everywhere , " I tell her . " Most accidents occur at home . " " Then why do n't you stay here with me ? " " Well , " I say , " perhaps I will . " Soon , of course , I quit my job and spend my days hovering over her as she crawls around and explores the house . Every corner seems to offer her both memory and fresh discovery . Small objects interest her more than ever . Pennies , paper clips , pencils . I have had to become more attentive with the vacuum . Three times a day , I offer her silver spoonfuls of mashed apples and sweet potatoes . Warm milk from a bottle . I stand over her crib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear I 'm losing you , " I tell her , But she can only stretch her pudgy limbs and smile . She cries all the time now and all I can do is stand and listen . She wants things but I do n't know what . If only she could tell me . It 's ripping my heart apart . I refuse to leave her side . I want her to know that I 'm there , here , holding her tiny hand through everything , these last moments of strangeness and torment . I stare at her so constantly that it 's difficult for me to notice the changes , to see her getting smaller , but I know she is , she is slipping away . I wake up to the sound of moaning , mature , anguished grunts . A woman , sweaty and out of breath , is getting up from the carpet , swollen belly rising first . She glances at me , stress and fear behind her eyes , and rushes out the door . The crib is empty . She is gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to explain loss , to capture the feeling of emptiness . I still have not left the house . I am simply not interested . I am waiting . At night , I try to squeeze myself into the crib , to smell the sheets where she once lay . I rest my head on the hook she gave me . Though I am no longer sure I am getting younger , I believe that it will happen , that soon the world will take me back as well , to join her , in the infinite , beautiful space of possibility .
