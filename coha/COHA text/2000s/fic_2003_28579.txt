Ann and the gIRLS will be baring all , so to speak , for our local Avatare Productions ' deliciously dishy videographer Jacob Faulkner . This reporter , for one , can only hope for a bit of reciprocal baring . We all know that there is nothing quite as yummy as a man stripped to his bare essentials ! Until that blissful day , dear readers ... Samantha Venus signing off for Urban Attitude Magazine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood church two blocks from the Hollisters ' home . Three quick steps into the air-conditioned interior and she thudded to a stop . " You 've got to be kidding me , " she muttered , knowing he was n't kidding her at all . What he was doing was ignoring every word of this morning 's phone conversation during which she 'd told him - yet again - where she wanted the cameras located for tonight 's taping of Lauren and Anton 's wedding . Melanie jammed her pocket PC 's stylus into its slot , then zipped the whole device into the pale yellow case at her waist . She was not about to let down the bride or the groom . Especially not after the honor of being asked to handle their wedding video details . Setting her videographer on the straight and narrow had just become job one . Her status as gIRL-gEAR 's resident geek gave Melanie the inside scoop on the city 's best in high-tech photographers and video firms . And Avatare Productions had been the obvious choice . Or so she 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard-headed , opinionated and - yes , okay - admittedly hunky crew chief . No doubt about it . Jacob Faulkner had been put on this earth to ruin her life . But she 'd be damned if she 'd let him ruin her day . Marching down the aisle to the raised dais , she stood on the first step , watching him tilt one of the remote-controlled cameras he 'd mounted on either end of the choir box railing . " Back up about three steps , " he ordered her without looking up . Melanie took three steps toward him instead . " What are you doing ? " " The job I 've been hired to do . " Frowning at the camera 's LCD screen , he gestured to a point behind where she stood . " Not forward . Back . About six steps . " She shoved hands to hips and dug in her heels . She so did not want to fight with this man . Not today . " I thought we agreed the planter boxes were situated in the best spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ check the LCD image . " You suggested the planters . " He shrugged . " I considered the suggestion . " Obviously for about as long as it had taken him to throw it away . She , on the other hand , had checked out the angle at least a dozen times and knew she was right . She tightened both hands into fists . " Look , I know you 're doing your job , but the bride is one of my business partners and a very good friend . She and the groom have put their trust in me to make this work . I intend to see that it does . " " The very reason I 'm here , sweetheart . " Again he waved her back before bending to check hidden wires and connections . " Six steps is all I need . Think of it as earning that trust . " Melanie pressed her lips together and held her tongue , an act that required more effort than she 'd expected . Why were men so threatened by a strong woman 's input @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had to establish dominance and power and all other matters by penis size . Frowning , Jacob straightened and resumed viewing the camera 's display . " How tall are you ? " " Five-eight , but what my height has to do with anything - " " Same as the bride . Heels look to be about the same , too . Once you 're in place , I 'll have a better idea of what I 'm working with here . " Shoving a hand through hair that had to look like a mop by now , Melanie gritted her teeth . Compromises rubbed against her grain when it came to boys who thought they were the boss . But this was n't about her . This was about Lauren . So Melanie offered the only concession she was willing to make . " I know you can control the zoom remotely , but I 'm worried the cameras are too far off center . " " They 're not . " " So you say . I want to see exactly what you 're seeing . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jacob glanced halfway in her direction . " Look . You 've got control issues . That 's cool . But could you save it for another guy ? I 'm not really into being whipped . " Melanie sputtered . Control issues ? Whipped ? He straightened suddenly and met her eyes . " Hey , sorry . I should n't have said that . " Not " Hey , sorry , I did n't mean that . " She crossed her arms and waited . He gestured to his camera . " It 's just that there 's no way you can see what I 'm seeing , even looking at the same view screen . We 'd focus on different things . " " And how do you know that ? " " I 've been at this for a lot of years . Time and experience have changed what I see , what I look for , " he said . Then he added , " Besides , you 're a girl . And I 'm a guy - a very intuitive type , mind you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Really ? " " Really . " He pressed his lips together in a cocky , bad boy sort of grin before adding , " Kind , considerate and sensitive , too . " She snorted . He offered a modest shrug . " Hey , it 's what all the women tell me . " Bonehead . " Right . You 're not into being whipped . " Jacob 's mouth quirked . A nice mouth , Melanie hated to notice . His burgeoning smile showed off great teeth and deep dimples , and hinted at a charming sense of humor . Just not enough of a hint to counter the black marks he 'd racked up with his control issues remark . Still ... Lauren . Think about Lauren . ( Continues ... )
