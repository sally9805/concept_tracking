Canada 's first national park is heavily visited and highly commercialized . But get off the main road , and you can still experience its indescribable beauty far from the shops and SUVs. // A railroad runs through it . So , too , does a transcontinental highway . And three ski areas . Canada 's 2,564-square-mile Banff National Park even wraps its majestic Rocky Mountain arms around an eponymous town that is home to more than 7,000 four-season residents . Banff is one busy place , hosting more commercial development than the four largest U.S. national parks combined . Fortunately , some 95 percent of Banff 's six million annual visitors do n't stray more than 200 yards from a paved road , according to a recent study . They 're content to take in a few greatest hits-stopping for a drink at the palatial Banff Springs Hotel , driving the wondrous Icefields Parkway , browsing the stylish shops in town . That leaves most of the park uncrowded and undisturbed-and requiring a bit more effort to discover than what the teeming masses are willing to expend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Banff , away from the SUVs and Gucci shops , and closer to the soul of the park . Where the Ancients Once Trod A Hike to Healy Pass don Mickle pauses by a couple of fat boulders conveniently located just below the swayback ridge of Healy Pass . The nearest trailhead is six miles away , at the Sunshine Village ski resort parking lot . The pass is a popular rest stop for hikers wanting to soak up the unobstructed Sound of Music views . Millennia before Vibram-soled boots and Gore-Tex jackets , Mickle says , someone sat on this rock-nearly 8,000 feet in elevation-knapping flint . Mickle would know . As the man in charge of cultural resources management at Banff , he came here last summer as archaeologists unearthed dozens of flint flakes , the telltale signs of a primitive tool factory . The park is filled with similar finds : remnants of prehistoric pithouses , 10,000-year-old spear points . Mickle often wonders where these ancient mountain people came from-and what drew them to such heights . Now in his late 50s , Mickle , raised on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relic himself . He 's the oldest active warden in the park , having started in nearby Glacier National Park in the 1960s . In the 1970s , he worked avalanche control , which back then largely meant wheeling in howitzers that " blasted the hell out of the mountains . " Nobody has covered more square miles of Banff on foot and on horse than Mickle . He sports a droopy mustache , wears a battered Stetson , and prefers to hike with a walking stick . Mickle 's demeanor is that of a friendly small-town sheriff who can be easily talked out of issuing a speeding ticket . Temperamentally , that makes him the polar opposite of Bill Peyto , the legendary , famously cantankerous **26;391;TOOLONG who has come to symbolize the wild and woolly days of early Banff . Peyto 's idea of a joke was to walk into a bar with a live lynx perched on his shoulder . " This was sort of his valley , " Mickle says , as we begin descending from Healy Pass . After walking 15 minutes , he turns offtrail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thick as the dots in a pointillist painting . There , in a tight clearing in the undergrowth , stands a one-room log cabin in slow decay . This was Peyto 's " main domicile , " says Mickle , who refuses to erect a trail sign for the cabin , in part to deter vandalism , in part to preserve the element of surprise . " When people bump into it , " Mickle explains , " there 's a sense of discovery . He built it in 1914 and used it till the ' 40s . " The tin roof has holes , and one wall is listing badly . But Peyto 's bunk is intact . A washtub , pans , and a shoe are scattered on the floor . A leather bridle hangs on a post . The windows are covered with barbed wire Peyto nailed in place decades ago to ward off bears . We bushwhack back to the trail , past the drift fence where Peyto tethered his horses , past the do-it-yourself copper mine he scratched out of a hillside . Peyto never made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , make a solid-gold name for himself as a guide , along with the other tough , muleheaded men who blazed the trails that opened these mountains to the masses . Peyto eventually grew more and more reclusive , his orneriness morphing into paranoia . He became convinced even his wife was trying to poison him . There 's a lot of heartbreak in these hills . When Don Mickle needs to escape the office , he often drives to Johnson Lake , a few miles outside Banff 's town limits . At one end of the lake is an abandoned cabin built in 1910 by Billy Carver . " Somebody said he was an English tea taster , " Mickle recalls . " He came to work the mines at Bankhead . " The mines closed , and Carver withdrew into the woods , spending the last 27 years of his life as a hermit . The opposite end of the lake was formerly occupied by Anthracite , a boom-to-bust coal town . Born 1886 . Died 1904 . Parts of a dynamite shed are left and some unmarked graves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " bawdy house , " the people are all gone . Mickle will soon be history , too . Retirement looms . He has no plans to move to a Sunbelt state and take up golf ; in fact , he may help out a daughter who 's a private guide in Banff . " When I first came here , I just loved the mountains , " Mickle says . " I did n't care about getting rich . In the long run I could n't think of a better way of spending my working life . " Going Deep But Not Far Meeting Mother Nature at Bow Lake a group of Japanese tourists step from their bus and head for the shore of Bow Lake . They pose for pictures with Crowfoot Mountain hulking in the background , oblivious to the mud puddles at their feet and to the thin , bearded man who finds the puddles so fascinating . " I 've seen tadpoles lying under a layer of ice in that puddle , " says Mike McIvor , " just a day or two from coming ashore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of newly minted , ink-black tadpoles are motoring through the water right now , looking like hyperactive apostrophes . A Japanese tour guide overhears McIvor and peels off from her group . " How you spell baby frog ? " she asks . " T-a-d-p-o-l-e , " says McIvor . The woman smiles . She hears a faint noise and wonders aloud if it 's a frog croaking . " No , " McIvor replies . " That 's a raven . " Bemused , McIvor notes that most of us are " environmental illiterates . " Nature is a thick book written in a foreign tongue we 're too impatient to learn . We take pretty photos but ca n't fathom the living landscape in our viewfinders . McIvor himself was a typical environmental dumbo when he arrived in Banff almost 40 years ago . Then he met his future wife , Diane , who encouraged him to pay attention to the living things all around him , even at boot level . McIvor worked in town as a gardener , steadily gaining a reputation as a savvy , self-taught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now to explore living landscapes . " You 've got to experience the natural world on its own terms-and at its own pace , " he says . Most visitors will spend maybe 15 minutes admiring Bow Lake . McIvor leads photographer Chris Rainier and me on a five-hour tour . We do n't cover much more than a mile of terrain , but every five feet reveals something new . McIvor stoops down to point out a yellow wildflower called cinque-foil that has petals no bigger than my pinkie fingernail ... some purplish willow herb ... the Hedysarum plant whose roots are a favorite of grizzly bears . " What we 're seeing , " McIvor explains , " is a process of colonization . As the glacier recedes , life is coming back . " Something black whizzes by , headed downstream . " That was John Muir 's favorite bird , " McIvor says . " We call it the American dipper . In Muir 's day it was a water ouzel . If you 're lucky , you 'll hear them . They 've got a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arguably the most respected voice for conservation in the greater Bow Valley . He lobbied intensely for animal overpasses on the highway . Lately he has been emphasizing the need to protect " front country " that 's heavily trafficked but nonetheless beautiful to behold . " One of the things I like about Bow Lake , " McIvor says as we march past yellow saxifrage and green lilies , " is that we have n't gone far and we 've already lost sight of the lodge . " After a brown-bag lunch , we start retracing our steps to the parking lot . Suddenly , McIvor reaches for the binoculars hanging around his neck . " I think that 's a harlequin duck , " he gushes . " If there 's any chance it was nesting around here , that would be pretty interesting . " Parks Canada officials talk openly about someday having to adopt a guest-pass quota system for Banff . Some biologists worry that the wolves and grizzlies will disappear . But no matter how much the living landscape changes , Mark and Diane McIvor will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anyone asks where they 'll be going on vacation , McIvor gives the same answer : Banff National Park . " Some people want to see a little of a lot , and some people want to see a lot of a little , " he says , rounding a bend in Bow Lake . " I guess we 're in that latter group . " Pure , Straight-Whiskey Banff On Horseback to Dormer Valley my horse is stuck in neutral . He needs to scamper up a tiny hillock but ca n't quite summon the nerve . So we cha-cha in place . One step forward , one step back , one step forward .... " He smells the bear , " says Ted Hart , who is right behind me on an unflappable gray stallion . Bear ? I have this sudden urge to go shopping for Louis Vuitton luggage in downtown Banff , but dutifully heel-kick my horse in the ribs . He finds first gear . We lurch ahead . Four of us are riding nose to tail , steadily gaining elevation , working our way toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horseback , has been conducting horse trips in Banff National Park for 40 years . He always takes the point position . Hart , a trim man with a professorial air , brings up the rear . It 's our second day in the saddle . We are bound for 8,000-foot-high Dormer Pass , a good 20 miles from the nearest flush toilet . This is pure , straight-whiskey Banff . " It 's kind of like diving into the last century , " Suenje Petersen told me at dinner last night . She 's the German-born cook at one of Holiday on Horseback 's permanent tent camps . " Unless you 're really going to the high country , you have n't seen anything . " A city slicker like me could n't be in better hands . Hart , a writer and historian , directs the foundation that oversees the Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies in Banff . He is a font of information and can say things like " the Columbia Icefields , of course , are the hydrographie apex of the North American continent , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1962 " with a pickup truck and a saddle , " which he managed to parlay into a lucrative business . Warner still bales hay , knows his rope hitches , and looks damn good in a cowboy hat . His politics are conservative , and when it comes to the future of Banff National Park , he worries that , " We can analyze it to death . " Purists complain about the toll horses take on trails , but , dang it , horseback riding sure beats walking when it comes to covering backcountry mileage . Few Western experiences compare to a long ride filled with long silences punctuated only by the swishing of tails , clip-clop of hooves , and a few full-throttle snorts . " Of what avail are 40 freedoms , " conservationist Aldo Leopold wrote , " without a blank spot on the map ? " Our horses are taking us to the edge of the map . " Last time I was here , there were sheep all over there , eh , " says Hart , eyeing a jagged peak . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enter a vast alpine meadow flanked by parallel rocky ridges . This is what makes saddle sores worthwhile . Warner figures Dormer Pass sees no more than 30 human beings a year . " It 's a lot of work gettin ' to these special places , " he says , as we pause to stretch our legs , " but on a day like this it 's worth it . " We ride on at the slow , deliberate pace of gunfighters entering Dodge City . I spot a lone ram on the ridgeline to our right . By twos and threes , more bighorn sheep appear , silhouetted against the sky like Indian scouts in an old John Ford Western . Two rams square off and put on a head-butting show . The eagles riding the thermals overhead ignore us . Upon reaching the saddle of Dormer Pass , we dismount and let the horses graze . To the north , the Dormer Valley forms a long funnel . Everything around us-mountains , trees , sky , shale-seems as if it 's being sucked toward the horizon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Yesterday Hart noted that the Whyte Museum planned to build a multimillion-dollar theater and shoot a state-of-the-art film on the park . Then visitors could experience deep Banff from the comfort of a cushioned chair . Today , however , standing where mountains meet the sky at Dormer Pass , Hart does n't mention the film . " Descriptions ca n't match what it really looks like , " he says softly . " You have to be here .
