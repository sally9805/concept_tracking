THE REBIRTH OF DESIGN <P> The redesigning of America is not likely to stop with the objects highlighted in your cover story DESIGN , March 20 . The consumer will have to remodel the kitchen to accept new gadgets . We 'll have to reinvent a nail for the elegant hammer and prepare attractive trash for the see-through wastebasket . We architects designed buildings based on such concepts as " form follows function , " " organic architecture " and " less is more . " Now industrial designers are coining terms like " blobjects , " " commodity chic " and " cutensils " by creating items to match . Kudos to them . CLEMENT R. PRABAKARAN Sterling Heights , Mich . <P> There is no longer a battle between form and function . Today designers are taking products already relevant to people and shaping them to reflect better what consumers actually want . Designers have respect for those who buy and use their products . In the 2000s the world of design will be even more respectful and participatory . The best designers will seek inspiration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LIZ SANDERS Columbus , Ohio <P> Have I benefited from the new economy ? The answer is definitively yes . Will I ever pay $385 for a zinc-and-steel ironing board ? The answer is definitively " not in this lifetime . " MICHAEL OAKLEAF Madison , Wis . <P> Function is out ? Say it is n't so ! The nouveaux contours and colors of products merely top off the vast improvements that have been made in the underlying functional design . Moreover , consumers demand that products function conveniently , safely , ecologically and obviously . We scoff at a microwave oven with a complex 50-button console . If you ca n't figure out how to heat a cup of cocoa without reading the instructions , it 's the manufacturer who is stupid . A fuchsia cell phone might be pretty , but a cell phone that does not require a manual  --  now that 's truly beautiful . KATRINA GALWAY Washington <P> Your examples of modern design are overwhelmingly cheap plastic junk . It 's frightening how Americans shrink-wrap and live in so much environmentally unsound plastic . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electronics hardware , kitchen utensils and packaging . Classy design that can stand the test of time will always come in the form of distinctive and natural woods , metals , stone and leather . ERIK GAUGER Redondo Beach , Calif . <P> To the new wave of design , I say , " oh , no ! More mass-produced junk that people will get bored with and throw in the landfill . " How about promoting a different new wave of design that makes beautiful , durable and functional objects from recycled materials ? HEATH GAMACHE Prospect , Pa . <P> Re America 's new design : why must we consume this type of kitsch to express our individuality ? JON GLAZERMAN Columbia , Mo . <P> When I moved from Sweden to San Francisco 12 years ago , I had a design-horror experience . My family left all our furniture behind in Sweden , intending to furnish our home with all new things . Little did we know . After weeks of endless looking , I cried my eyes out . Never had I seen such ugliness . Growing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to design . Wherever you go , there are perfect shapes , materials and , above all , quality . I have noticed changes in the U.S. in the past few years . Things that I bring back from my trips to Europe can now be found here . But design is still not on a lot of Americans ' minds .
