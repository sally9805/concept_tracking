Headnote Remembering the dawn of the space age Well , I say the fun has just begun We 're on Sputnik Number One A'flying through outer space At a rockin ' rolliri pace Oh ! We 're gon na get our kicks On a little ole thing called a Sputnik - Sputnik ( Satellite Girl ) In the fall of 1957 , pitcher Lew Burdette 's fastball gave the Milwaukee Braves a surprise World Series win over the New York Yankees . In Little Rock , Ark. , white mobs rioted after nine black I students dared to attend Central High School . On television , Leave It to Beaver made its debut . But for many people across the globe , the most riveting show was playing out overhead . Reaching an altitude as high as 940 kilometers , a shiny aluminum sphere was circling Earth 14 times a day . Scientists tracked its orbit , while ham radio operators tuned in to its alien " beep beep " -a sound that radio and television stations around the globe rebroadcast to millions . Some feared that the beeps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nuclear bomb . Others simply marveled at how a 184-pound hunk of metal could rocket into the sky and stay there . The space age began on Oct. 4 , 1957 , when the Soviets launched Sputnik , the first artificial satellite to orbit Earth . " Soviet Fires Earth Satellite Into Space , " blared the New York Times headline . " Myth has become reality : Earth 's gravity conquered , " read the banner of France 's Le Figaro . Fifty years later , satellites for science , surveillance , and communication have become commonplace . But if Sputnik was supposed to usher in an era of human colonies on the moon and astronauts rocketing off to other planets , that part of the story seems to have sputtered . FIRST STAGE If the U.S. public was caught off guard by Sputnik 's launch , the country 's scientists were not . Two years earlier , they and their Soviet counterparts had agreed to launch satellites carrying scientific instruments during the International Geophysical Year , beginning in July 1957 , during which the sun would reach the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ States , the Army , Navy , and Air Force argued over which of them should build a rocket that could put a satellite into Earth orbit . The Soviets , meanwhile , forged ahead . During the summer of 1957 , they even announced the two radio frequencies at which their satellite would broadcast-but not when it would launch . To make sure of beating the Americans to the punch , the Russians shelved plans for a scientifically sophisticated satellite and went with a far simpler model , building the device in just a month without the help of blueprints . On the evening of Oct. 4 , New York Times reporter Walter Sullivan was at the Russian embassy in Washington , D.C. , attending a reception for scientists , when he received an urgent telephone call from his Washington bureau chief . Tass , the Russian press agency , had just announced the launch of Sputnik-Russian for " traveling companion . " Sullivan shared the news with the U.S. scientists at the gathering , who made an impromptu speech congratulating their Russian colleagues . The party then repaired to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch a glimpse of the satellite . In fact , Sputnik was visible , but just barely . It was a mere 23-inch-diameter sphere with four swept-back antennas that , up close , gave the satellite a sleek , sci-fi look . It had but a single watt of power to transmit its radio signals . The duration of the beeps indicated the temperature and pressure , and that the craft had not been punctured by a meteorite . That night , 22-year-old engineering student Sergei Khrushchev was with his father , Nikita , in Kiev . The Soviet leader was meeting with Ukrainian officiais when he got a phone call and returned to the room smiling . " He told me a great thing has happened , " Sergei Khrushchev now recalls . " We had entered a new age , " Khrushchev says , but at first " we did n't understand all the significance . " The next day 's edition of Pravda , the official Russian newspaper , carried just a brief mention of the launch . " It was a shock to the West , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soviet Union was far behind them . We did n't think we were far behind . " Sputnik " changed the dynamics on Earth of what our society was going to be like , " says historian Roger Launius of the Smithsonian Institution 's National Air and Space Museum in Washington , D.C. " The ability to fly in space has utterly transformed our lives . Sputnik marks the beginning . " Despite the Cold War , fear was n't the first reaction of most Americans , Launius says . By coincidence , anthropologist Margaret Mead and a coworker were doing a survey about spaceflight just as Sputnik launched . What they found , says Launius , was " overwhelmingly a sense of excitement . " And there were some light-hearted responses . Jerry Englerth , who worked at Eastman Kodak and called his band Jerry Engler and the Four Ekkos , penned a rockabilly tune about Sputnik and went on tour with Buddy Holly . A bartender invented the Sputnik cocktail , a blend of vodka and grape juice-from sour grapes , of course . Sputnik burgers included Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rural Indiana , 7-year-old Steve Dick got a new puppy , which his family promptly named Sputnik . " I do n't remember being scared at all . . . it was just an awesome thing that people watched as it went overhead , " recalls Dick , now NASA 's space historian in Washington , D.C. But before long , fear took hold . " I think it was the result of a concerted effort on the part of several groups , " says Launius . The Democrats , including presidential hopeful Lyndon Baines Johnson , realized that they could turn the Russian feat into a critique of President Dwight D. Eisenhower 's administration . Many other groups-national-security personnel , aerospace-industry executives , space scientists who suddenly had access to the White House , and space-exploration enthusiasts who had been tagged " space cadets " and largely dismissed as kooks-saw a chance to push their views on a fascinated but anxious public , says Launius . In response , Eisenhower tried to dismiss Sputnik , noting its lack of data-gathering equipment . Members of his administration called Sputnik " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhetoric , like this verse by G. Mennen Williams , the Democratic governor of Michigan : O little Sputnik , flying high With made-in-Moscow beep , You tell the world it 's a Commie sky And Uncle Sam 's asleep . SECOND SURPRISE The anxiety and recriminations may have abated , but less than a month later , on Nov. 3-just in time to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the Bolshevik revolution-the Soviets launched Sputnik 2 . Ten times as heavy as Sputnik 1 , the satellite carried into orbit the first live cargo , a dog named Laika-which made a strictly one-way journey . The U.S. press promptly dubbed the dog Muttnik . At Red Square in Moscow , throngs cheered chief Sputnik engineer Sergei Korolev as well as Nikita Khrushchev . " A birthday flexing of Red biceps , " Life magazine called it . The second Russian launch further agitated the Eisenhower administration . " The thing to remember is that anything put on a rocket was also only a shadow away from putting a nuclear weapon on top of an intercontinental ballistic missile , " notes Air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peaceful purposes for the satellites , but they were also a demonstration to the world of the capability of the Russian military presence in space . " On Dec. 6 , the press was invited to Cape Canaveral , FIa. , to witness the U.S. response to Sputnik . Newsreel cameras rolled as a modified Navy Vanguard rocket carrying a small satellite lifted off the launch pad . It rose just 4 feet before erupting in a fireball , sending the grapefruit-size satellite in its nose cone hurtling across the sands . The next day 's headlines provided the postmortem : " Flopnik , " " Dudnik , " " Kaputnik . " Wernher von Braun , whose earlier plan to adapt an Army rocket had been ditched in favor of the Navy 's project , was now brought back into the game . On Jan. 31 , 1958-with no press in attendance-von Braun 's Jupiter-C rocket successfully launched the first U.S. satellite , Explorer I. A Geiger counter on the satellite recorded the first evidence of what are now known as the Van Allen radiation belts , bands of energetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ March , President Eisenhower founded NASA , the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , a civilian agency devoted to space exploration . Spurred by what would soon become a wellworn phrase- " Soviet children are playing chess while American children are playing checkers " - politicians poured money into math and science education . Educators revised the K-12 science curriculum and introduced the baby-boom generation to " new math . " Every classroom , it seemed , got an overhead projector as its new , hightech weapon against the Russians . Nevertheless , " there were 5 to 6 years of almost unparalleled Soviet dominance " in space , notes Launius . The highlight may have come on April 12 , 1961 , when Yuri Gagarin became the first person to orbit Earth , circling once in a Vostok spacecraft . Eisenhower always maintained that there was no space race , but he could n't really afford to say otherwise , says Weitekamp . " Because if we were in a race , the Soviets had beaten the pants off the Americans . They had the first satellites , the first man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have two capsules in space together , the first rendezvous . " Jolted into action , Eisenhower 's successor , John F. Kennedy , decided that the United States should embark on a major project that would eclipse Russian superiority . After consulting his advisors , including LBJ , Kennedy spoke before a joint session of Congress on May 25 , 1961 , and announced " the goal , before this decade is out , of landing a man on the moon and returning him safely to Earth . " Through 1972 , NASA focused almost exclusively on that goal with the Apollo missions , which put 12 men on the lunar surface , beginning with Neil Armstrong 's " one small step " on July 20 , 1969 . But after Apollo , just as the country was undergoing a cultural upheaval , NASA found itself without a clear-cut goal . " I kind of imagine all these military-buzz-cut engineers who pop their heads up and suddenly they 're in an environment of stagflation , their budget shrinking instead of exploding , and it 's a whole other ball @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logsdon of the George Washington ( D.C. ) University , " Kennedy decided to go to the moon to be there first . Period . And we got there first and then stopped . " LASTING LESSONS " What we 've learned from Sputnik is that a shock can get you started ... but you 'd better have a good , sustainable science initiative to keep going , " says Logsdon . " We have n't done a very good job of providing goals for ourselves in space . " For the first decade after Sputnik , " we had this competition with the Soviet Union and then we chose what turned out to be a dead-end-space shuttle and space station . " The shuttle ended up being an unwieldy , costy , and ultimately dangerous way to take astronauts into space-especially after 3 decades of use . The space station has been roundly criticized by scientists for draining NASAs budget while having limited research value . Plans for a human presence beyond Earth 's orbit seemed to get aboost with President George W Bush 's 2004 announcement NASA would return @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But those plans lack the financial support that Kennedy and LBJ garnered , notes Logsdon . They also appear to lack broad support from politicians and the public . In many ways , the visions of space exploration that flowered soon after Sputnik , including complex space colonies , did n't materialize . Von Braun envisioned human flights to Mars , using a nuclear-powered rocket , by 1984 . But in other respects , Sputnik 's legacy has endured . Among the remarkable accomplishments over the past 50 years , says Logsdon , is that " we 've revolutionized our knowledge of the solar system and the universe , primarily through robotic missions . " In addition , " satellites are now managing the world , " he adds . With some 850 operational devices now circling Earth , satellites are at the core of worldwide communications , the Global Positioning System , and data gathering on topics as vital as global warming . Today , it 's taken for granted that " every local news station has access to regional satellite views " to forecast storms , notes space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Most satellites are now launched by private industry . " There are more launches on a regular basis than people realize , " says DeVorkin . " There 's a booming business in launching satellites and a whole space industry . " The race among entrepreneurs into space exploration is heating up . As a follow-on to the $10 million Ansari X prize , awarded in 2004 to the first private company to fly a piloted craft twice into space within a 2-week period , the Internet company Google last month announced a new space competition : the $30 million Lunar X prize to the first company to land a robotic rover on the moon and beam pictures back to Earth . Does the United States need another Sputnik to spur space exploration ? Competition pushes progress , says Launius . " Mickey Mantle and Roger Maris were both great home run hitters , but neither of them did as well as when they competed with each other . " For DeVorkin , the new Sputnik-the crisis at hand begging for a U.S. response-is global warming . " U.S. space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Earth-sun connection " he says . A fleet of data-gathering satellites could be used by climate scientists needing to better understand and address global warming . " It 's a question of personal moral responsibility , " says DeVorkin . " We do n't deserve to go further into space " unless this problem is solved . A program devoted to the study of global warming would involve international collaboration more than competition . **28;6011;TOOLONG have the chance to build on Sputnik 's legacy , DeVorkin says , by using the technology developed during the space race to " galvanize and really focus on self-preservation " of the planet .
