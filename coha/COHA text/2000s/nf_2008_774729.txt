It 's Catching // My friend Patsy was telling me a story . " So I 'm at the movie theater , " she said , " and I 've got my coat all neatly laid out against the back of my seat , when this guy comes along - " And here I stopped her , because I 've always wondered about this coat business . When I 'm in a theater , I either fold mine in my lap or throw it over my armrest , but Patsy always spreads hers out , acting as if the seat back were cold , and she could n't possibly enjoy herself while it was suffering . // " Why do you do that ? " I asked , and she looked at me , saying , " Germs , silly . Think of all the people who have rested their heads there . Does n't it just give you the creeps ? " I admitted that it had never occurred to me. // " Well , you 'd never lie on a hotel bedspread , would you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I might not put it in my mouth , but to lie back and make a few phone calls-I do it all the time . // " But you wash the phone first , right ? " // " Umm . No. " // " Well , that is just ... dangerous , " she said . // In a similar vein , I was at the grocery store with my sister Lisa and I noticed her pushing the cart with her forearms. // " What 's up ? " I asked . // " Oh , " she said , " you do n't ever want to touch the handle of a grocery cart with your bare hands . These things are crawling with germs. " // Is it just Americans , or does everyone think this way ? In Paris once , I went to my neighborhood supermarket and saw a man shopping with his cockatiel , which was the size of a teenage eagle and stood perched on the handle of his cart . // I told this to Lisa , and she said , " See ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have . " She had a point , but it 's not like everyone takes a cockatiel to the grocery store . A lifetime of shopping , and this was the first exotic bird I 'd ever seen browsing the meat counter . // The only preventive thing I do is wash clothes after buying them in a thrift shop-this after catching crabs from a pair of used pants . I was in my midtwenties at the time and probably would I got a bottle of something called Quell . After applying it , I raked through my pubic hair with a special nit comb , and what I came away with was a real eye-opener : these little monsters who 'd been feasting for weeks on my flesh . I guess they 're what Patsy imagines when she looks at a theater seat , what Lisa sees lurking on the handle of a grocery cart . // They 're minor , though , compared with what Hugh had . He was eight years old and living in the Congo when he noticed a red spot on his leg . Nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the spot became more painful , and the day after that he looked down and saw a worm poking out . // A few weeks later , the same thing happened to Maw Hamrick , which is what I call Hugh 's mother , Joan . Her worm was a bit shorter than her son 's , not that the size really matters . If I was a child and saw something creeping out of a hole in my mother 's leg , I would march to the nearest orphanage and put myself up for adoption . I would burn all pictures of her , destroy anything she had ever given me , and start all over because that is simply disgusting . A dad can be crawling with parasites and somehow it 's OK , but on a mom , or any woman , really , it 's unforgivable. // " Well , that 's sort of chauvinistic of you , do n't you think ? " Maw Hamrick said . She 'd come to Paris for Christmas , as had Lisa and her husband , Bob . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used wrapping paper and ironing it flat with her hands . " It was just a guinea worm . People got them all the time . " She looked toward the kitchen , where Hugh was doing something to a goose . " Honey , where do you want me to put this paper ? " // " Burn it , " Hugh said . // " Oh , but it 's so pretty . Are you sure you wo n't want to use it again ? " // " Burn it , " Hugh repeated . // " What 's this about a worm ? " Lisa asked . She was lying on the sofa with a blanket over her , still groggy from her nap . // " Joan here had a worm living inside her leg , " I said , and Maw Hamrick threw a sheet of wrapping paper into the fire , saying , " Oh , I would n't call that living . " // " But it was inside of you ? " Lisa said , and I could see her wheels turning : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have I ever touched her coffee cup , or eaten off her plate ? How soon can I get tested ? Are the hospitals open on Christmas Day , or will I have to wait until tomorrow ? // " It was a long time ago , " Joan said . // " Like , how long ? " Lisa asked . // " I do n't know-1968 , maybe . " // My sister nodded , the way someone does when she 's doing math in her head . " Right , " she said , and I regretted having brought it up . She was no longer looking at Maw Hamrick but through her , seeing what an X-ray machine might : the stark puzzle of bones and , teeming within it , the thousands of worms who did not leave home in 1968 . I used to see the same thing , but after fifteen years or so , I got over it , and now I just see Maw Hamrick . Maw Hamrick ironing , Maw Hamrick doing the dishes , Maw Hamrick taking out the trash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always looking for something to do . // " Can I maybe ... ? " she asks , and before she 's finished I answer yes , by all means . // " Did you tell my mother to crawl on her hands and knees across the living room floor ? " Hugh asks , and I say , " Well , no , not exactly . I just suggested that if she was going to dust the baseboards , that would be the best way to do it . " // When Maw Hamrick 's around , I do n't lift a finger . All my chores go automatically to her , and I just sit in a rocker , raising my feet every now and then so she can pass the vacuum . It 's incredibly relaxing , but it does n't make me look very good , especially if she 's doing something strenuous , carrying furniture to the basement , for instance , which again , was completely her idea . I just mentioned in passing that we rarely used the dresser , and that one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't mean her , exactly , though at age seventy-six she 's a lot stronger than Hugh gives her credit for . Coming from Kentucky , she 's used to a hard day 's work . Choppin ' , totin ' , all those activities with a dropped g : the way I figure it , these things are in her genes . // It 's only a problem when other people are around , and they see this slight , white-haired woman with sweat running down her forehead . Lisa and Bob , for instance , who were staying in Patsy 's empty apartment . Every night they 'd come over for dinner , and Maw Hamrick would hang up their coats before ironing the napkins and setting the table . Then she 'd serve drinks and head into the kitchen to help Hugh . // " You really lucked out , " Lisa said , sighing , as Joan rushed to empty my ashtray . Her mother-in-law had recently moved into an assisted living development , the sort of place that 's renounced the word " seniors " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I love Bob 's mom to death , but Hugh 's - my God ! And to think that she was eaten by worms . " // " Well , they did n't technically eat her , " I said . // " Then what were they living on ? Are you telling me they brought their own food ? " // I guessed that she was right , but what do guinea worms eat ? Certainly not fat , or they 'd never have gone to Joan , who weighs ninety pounds , tops , and can still fit into her prom gown . Not muscle , or she 'd never be able to take over my chores . Do they drink blood ? Drill holes in bone and sop up the marrow ? I meant to ask , but when Maw Hamrick returned to the living room the topic immediately turned to cholesterol , Lisa saying , " I do n't mean to pry , Joan , but what is your level ? " // It was one of those conversations I was destined to be left out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not sure what cholesterol actually is . I hear the word and imagine a pale gravy , made by hand , with lumps in it . // " Have you tried fish oil ? " Lisa asked . " That brought Bob 's level from three-eighty to two-twenty . Before that , he was on Lipitor . " My sister knows the name and corresponding medication for every disease known to man , an impressive feat given that she 's completely self-taught . Congenital ichthyosis , myositis ossificans , spondylolisthesis , calling for Cel e brex , Flexeril , oxycodone hydrochloride . I joked that she 'd never bought a magazine in her life , that she reads them for free in doctors ' waiting rooms , and she asked what my cholesterol level was . " You better see a doctor , mister , because you 're not as young as you think you are . And while you 're there , you might want to have those moles looked at . " // It 's nothing I wanted to think about , especially on Christmas , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goose . " Let 's talk about accidents instead , " I said . " Heard of any good ones ? " // " Well , it 's not exactly an accident , " Lisa said , " but did you know that every year five thousand children are startled to death ? " It was a difficult concept to grasp , so she threw off her blanket and acted it out . " Say a little girl is running down the hall , playing with her parents , and the dad pops up from behind a corner , saying ' Boo ! ' or ' Gotcha ! ' or whatever . Well , it turns out that that child can actually collapse and die . " // " I do n't like that one bit , " Maw Hamrick said . // " Well , no , neither do I , " Lisa said . " I 'm just saying that it happens at least five thousand times a year . " // " In America or the world over ? " Maw Hamrick asked , and my sister called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , are five thousand children a year startled to death in the United States or in the entire world put together ? " He did n't answer , so Lisa decided it was just the United States . " And those are just the reported cases , " she said . " A lot of parents probably do n't want to own up to it , so their kids ' deaths are attributed to something else . " // " Those poor children , " Maw Hamrick said . // " And the parents ! " Lisa added . " Can you imagine ? " // Both groups are tragic , but I was wondering about the surviving children , or , even worse , the replacements , raised in an atmosphere of preventive sobriety . " All right , now , Caitlin Two , when we get home a great many people are going to jump out from behind the furniture and yell ' Happy Birthday ! ' I 'm telling you now because I do n't want you to get too worked up about it . " // No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a parent ca n't control everything , and there 's still the outside world to contend with , a world of backfiring cars and their human equivalents . // Maybe one day you 'll look down and see a worm , waving its sad , penile head from a hatch it has bored in your leg . If that wo n't stop your heart , I do n't know what will , but Hugh and his mother seem to have survived . Thrived , even . The Hamricks are made of stronger stuff than I am . That 's why I let them cook the goose , move the furniture , launder the hideous creatures from my secondhand clothing . If anything were to startle them to death , it would be my offer to pitch in , and so I settle back on the sofa with my sister and wave my coffee cup in the air , signaling for another refill . // ( Continues ... ) //
