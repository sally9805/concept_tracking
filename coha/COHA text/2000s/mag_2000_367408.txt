As Sinatra was to popular music , so John Gielgud was to theater : The Voice . It could draw a word out into a long cello note or quaver like the lead fiddle in the pit of a Victorian melodrama . It made Shakespeare 's verse immediately comprehensible and ethereal : perfectly analyzed , beautifully felt . Declaiming the final scene from King Lear in his solo Shakespeare show The Ages of Man , Sir John sounded like a noble basset . " Howl , howl , howl , howl ! " The tone was mournful , then ( an octave higher ) deranged , then weirdly ecstatic and finally strangulated , stilled . <P> For nearly 80 years in theater , film , radio and TV , Gielgud , who died last week at 96 , gave such passionately acute readings in works sublime and not so ; what other actor would be pleased both to be the definitive romantic Hamlet , which he acted some 500 times , and to lend regal pedigree to Bob Guccione 's pornific Caligula ? Who else could earn critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , from the neck up " ? <P> Which is to say , Sir John was not Laurence Olivier . Gielgud lacked his rival 's physicality and physique . The Gielgud visage was squinty , Magoo-like , and he did n't care to wear tights because of his knock-knees . As a stage presence , Olivier was all sexy , pyrotechnical danger , a swashbuckler and a rogue , a bounding bounder . Gielgud was more remote , passionate mainly in melancholy . If theater is drama , then Olivier is your man of the century . If it is poetry , the mining of meaning from sound , then Gielgud fits another phrase Tynan applied to him : " Not so much an actor , as the actor . " <P> The actor was virtually born one : great-nephew of actress Ellen Terry and second cousin of designer Gordon Craig . By 21 , in Chekhov and Coward , he was a London fixture . He directed and starred in the renowned 1935 Romeo and Juliet ( the cast included Peggy Ashcroft , Edith Evans and Alec Guinness ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Mercutio ) in mid-run . Later he championed bold young playwrights , directing Tennessee Williams ' The Glass Menagerie , starring in Christopher Fry 's The Lady 's Not for Burning , Edward Albee 's Tiny Alice and Edward Bond 's Bingo . <P> In the ' 70s he teamed with the third great theater knight , Ralph Richardson , in two modern mystery plays : David Storey 's Home , in which two old gents chat thrillingly into their dotage ; and Harold Pinter 's No Man 's Land , with Gielgud superbly seedy as a down-on-his-art writer . Yet his first love was Shakespeare , and one imagines the feeling was mutual . In the celebratory book Sir John , Guinness recalls a dinner in the ' 30s when Gielgud dithered about which of many projects to do next . One chum finally said , " Oh , shut up , dear ! Just stick a crown on your head and get on with it ! " <P> He even got on with film . He made his first one in 1924 , but took ages to feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Secret Agent he is agonizingly squirmy . Eventually he logged some 130 credits in films and TV , most of them after he turned 75 . He won an Oscar as the proper , patient butler in Arthur , but his great turns are in Alain Resnais ' Providence , as a novelist with nightmares , and in Peter Greenaway 's Prospero 's Books  --  where he not only played his favorite Shakespearean magician but spoke almost all the dialogue and appeared nude !
