Published in the July 13 , 2009 issue : SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT : A caption in a story on President Obama 's health-reform plan misstated the name of a Mayo Clinic patient ; it is Kathy Anhalt June 29 . Obama 's diagnosis for health reform would cut costs by rewarding quality care and limiting unnecessary treatments . But one man 's economies are another 's lost profits . Ezekiel Emanuel got a memorable introduction to our haphazard health-care system on his first visit to a cancer ward as a medical student . The white coats were ordering a transfusion for a teenage girl , and since shyness does not run in his family -- brother Rahm is President Obama 's famously foulmouthed chief of staff , brother Ari a similarly silence-deficient Hollywood agent -- he interrupted to ask why . Because she had Hodgkin 's disease and her platelets were below 20,000 , the team explained . Emanuel still had questions : Was there evidence for that protocol ? Do n't some hospitals wait until 10,000 ? Why 20,000 ? Because that 's what we do here , one doc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adviser , Emanuel has spent much of his career battling the that's-what-we-do-here mentality of American medicine . " It drives me nuts -- the ignorance is overwhelming , " he says . " I 'm a data-driven guy . I want to see evidence . " It turns out that Emanuel 's boss , budget director Peter Orszag , is also a data-driven guy , as is Orszag 's boss , the President of the United States . They 've already stuffed $1.1 billion into the stimulus bill to jump-start " comparative effectiveness research " into which treatments work best in which situations . Now they 're pushing to overhaul the entire health-care sector by year 's end , and they 're determined to replace ignorance with evidence , to create a data-driven system , to shift one-sixth of the economy from " that 's what we do here " to " that 's what works . " The U.S. spends more on health care than any other country does , and studies have suggested that as much as 30% of it -- perhaps $700 billion a year -- may be wasted on unneeded care , mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stays , minor procedures and brand-name prescriptions that are requested by patients and ordered by doctors every day . Orszag is particularly obsessed with research by the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice , documenting huge regional variations in costs but virtually no variations in outcomes . For example , chronically ill patients in Los Angeles visited doctors an average of 59.2 times in the last six months of their life , vs. only 14.5 times in Ogden , Utah ; they still ended up just as dead . Medicare now pays three times as much per enrollee in Miami as in Honolulu , and costs are growing twice as fast in Dallas as in San Diego . Patients in higher-spending regions get more tests , more procedures , more referrals to specialists and more time in the hospital and ICU , but the Dartmouth research has found that if anything , their outcomes are slightly worse . " We 're flying blind , " says Dartmouth 's Dr. Elliott Fisher . " We 're getting quantity , not quality . " Why Less Would Be More Americans tend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes to the heroic brand of try-everything medicine we 've watched on ER and House M.D. But overtreatment is a national scandal . It 's bad for our health : with medical errors now estimated to be our eighth leading cause of death , drugs , procedures and hospital stays can be risky ( as well as painful , time-consuming and wallet-straining ) even when they 're necessary . It 's also bad for the economy : health costs are bankrupting small businesses and even conglomerates like General Motors as well as millions of families . And it 's awful for the country : Medicare is on track to go broke by 2017 , and our long-term budget problems are primarily health-cost problems . At current growth rates , health spending by the Federal Government alone would increase from 5% to 20% of the economy by 2050 ; Social Security , by contrast , would increase only from 5% to 6% . Alas , there 's no proven link between more spending and better care . The good news is that parts of the country provide care at a low cost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the U.S. could imitate them . One Dartmouth study found that if nationwide spending had mirrored the modest rate of that in Rochester , Minn.  - -  where care is dominated by the renowned Mayo Clinic -- Medicare would have reduced its costs for chronically ill patients by $50 billion from 2001 to 2005 As the old inflation-adjusted saying goes , pretty soon you 're talking about real money . But one man 's unnecessary costs are another man 's profits ; lobbyists for drug- and devicemakers , hospitals , doctors and insurers are already fighting to make sure their slices of the more than $2 trillion health-care pie are n't nibbled by reform . Senate Republicans just introduced " antirationing " legislation to bar the government from using **25;1310;TOOLONG research --  " a common tool used by socialized health-care systems "  - -  for cost control . They paused in their usual attacks on Obama 's profligacy just long enough to attack his stinginess , warning that he will use evidence as an excuse to micromanage the art of medicine , stifle innovation and deny Americans their right to choose whatever treatments they want -- or at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is transparent posturing , but there are legitimate concerns about politicians ' deciding when treatments are effective enough -- or , more controversially , cost-effective enough -- to be reimbursable . Medical knowledge is constantly evolving , and treatments that seem to lack solid evidence today might seem indispensable tomorrow . Wasteful tests and procedures do n't come with labels marked WASTEFUL , and most patients and providers genuinely believe the care they 're getting and giving is necessary . Comprehensive studies of what works can be slow , expensive and inconclusive . Even Orszag admits the savings from cutting out unneeded care would take a decade to materialize . Still , those savings could mean the difference between national solvency and fiscal catastrophe , so Obama is targeting two major barriers to data-driven medicine . The first is the perverse " fee-for-service " incentives that now plague our health-care system : hospitals get paid more if you stay longer and come back often ; doctors get paid more if they do more tests and procedures -- and you come back often . More services , more fees . " You 've got to follow the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ initial choice for health czar . " We reward volume , so that 's what we get . " Obama wants to reward quality instead . The other big barrier is information : evidence-based medicine is hard to practice without evidence . There are studies showing that generic and over-the-counter drugs for hypertension , heartburn and psychosis are often just as effective as costlier brand-name alternatives ; that stents can work miracles when inserted quickly after heart attacks but do n't seem to help much as preventive measures ; that the areas with the most hospital beds , imaging machines and specialists spend the most on excess hospital stays , MRIs and specialty care . But the big money in medical research goes to testing new drugs and cutting-edge technologies , not to comparing existing treatments . Drug companies often just have to prove that their products are better than placebos to get FDA approval ; new devices merely have to be similar to existing products . Nobody has to show that their drug or device works better than rival drugs or devices , or treatments that do n't require drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the things we do n't know . Then again , we do know what high-quality , low-cost medicine looks like . It 's already available in Rochester , Minn . The Mayo Way The Mayo Clinic attracts Kings and Presidents , injured athletes and ailing billionaires . When Mr. Burns visited Mayo on The Simpsons , Fidel Castro and the Pope were chatting in the waiting room . But Rochester 's costs are well below the national average because Mayo also provides tremendous value for ordinary care ; its flagship hospital spent just more than half as much per patient in the last two years of life as did the UCLA Medical Center . What makes Mayo different ? It 's clearly avoided the oversupply trap -- the UCLA center had about 50% more beds , and its chronically ill Medicare patients spent about 50% more time in the hospital . But that 's just part of the " Mayo way . " On a visit to Rochester last month , I watched a hospice team of nurses , social workers , a chaplain and just one doctor talk about dying patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emanuel 's cancer ward : platelets were discussed , but so were spiritual needs , family tensions , hobbies and anything else relevant to quality of life . It sounds squishy , but Mayo patients who request palliative care have 84% lower hospital costs , 53% lower overall costs and higher satisfaction . Mayo has computerized medical records that provide instant access to patient histories , improving information-sharing , reducing pharmacy errors and eliminating the hassle of tracking down charts . The staff cafeteria even gives away fruit , illustrating Mayo 's apple-a-day commitment to prevention and wellness . Like other low-cost , high-quality institutions -- the Cleveland Clinic , Geisinger in Pennsylvania , Intermountain in Utah -- Mayo is dedicated to offering integrated and coordinated care , with a broad network of providers working together to reduce redundant tests and office visits , improve disease management and generally avoid treating patients like pinballs . " It 's a team sport here , " says David Lewallen , a Mayo orthopedic surgeon . " A bunch of tennis players doing their own thing just does n't work -- it 's too expensive , and it 's bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we 're all looking over each other 's shoulders . " Mayo also has an institutional obsession with evidence-based medicine , using electronic records for in-house effectiveness research , constantly monitoring its doctors on everything from infection rates to operating times to patient outcomes , minimizing the art of medicine and maximizing the science . " We try to drive out variation wherever we can , " says Charles ( Mike ) Harper , a neurologist who oversees Mayo 's clinical practice in Rochester . " Practicing medicine is not the same as building Toyotas , but you can still standardize . Uncertainty should n't be an excuse to ignore data . " Mayo has teams working on evidence-based protocols to reduce the use of intensive care , lower valve-replacement costs and avoid unneeded transfusions . It 's standardizing a handoff protocol that reduced errors after shift changes at its Arizona branch , as well as a program that boosted patient satisfaction by teaching doctors at its Florida branch to listen better . Mayo even has its own registry to track artificial joints , which are expected to increase @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reducing the failure rate for artificial hips and knees 10% could save taxpayers $500 million a year . Mayo doctors are also shielded from the incentives that discourage evidence-based medicine , because they all receive fixed salaries . They do n't make more if they do more to patients , and they do n't make less if they take more time to talk to them -- even if they use the time to explain why a CT scan or a wonder drug advertised on TV might not be advisable . They do n't have to worry about reimbursements that overvalue radiological tests and invasive prostate treatments , undervalue preventive care and watchful waiting and put zero value on returning a phone call or thinking about a case . " We 've been able to buffer our staff from the harsh realities of the system , so they can concentrate on patient needs , " says Dawn Milliner , a kidney doctor who oversees clinical practice throughout Mayo . " But it 's not clear how long we can keep doing that . " That 's the bad news about Mayo 's success : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart , conservative , data-driven , patient-focused medicine is not necessarily profitable medicine . Last year , Mayo lost $840 million on $1.7 billion in Medicare work . It compensated by charging private insurers a premium for the Mayo name , but they 're starting to balk . " The system pays more money for worse care , " says Mayo CEO Denis Cortese . " If it does n't start paying for value instead of volume , it will destroy the culture of the organizations with the best care . We might have to start doing more procedures just to stay in business . " Are We the Change He Seeks ? In the coming weeks , millions of dollars will be spent on the health-care debate because trillions of dollars are at stake . Lobbyists are already warning that Obamacare will empower bureaucrats to reject new drugs and procedures on the basis of shadowy cost-effectiveness formulas that place a monetary value on life . Ads will soon transform the seemingly innocuous push for comparative research into a nightmarish vision of Big Government telling doctors what to do , suppressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minorities in pursuit of one-size-fits-all " cookbook medicine , " destroying an American tradition of personalized care . " It 's a $2 trillion industry with blood in the water , " says James Weinstein , head of the Dartmouth Institute . " You ca n't be surprised that the sharks are circling . " Helping organize the pushback against the drive for data has been former House whip and legendary Democratic operator Tony Coelho , an epileptic who helped write the Americans with Disabilities Act and now leads the Partnership to Improve Patient Care . The partnership is an odd coalition of the drug companies , devicemakers and medical specialists who stand to lose the most from evidence-based medicine , joined by a variety of patient groups ( some of whom also receive industry funding ) concerned about access to care . Coelho says he welcomes effectiveness research if it can help doctors and patients make more informed decisions , but he argues with passion that it should never be used to limit treatments , modify reimbursements or otherwise cut costs . " If you come at this trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much money on drugs and devices and Sally and Joe , the American people will revolt , " Coelho says . " You 'll get your jollies because you 're bringing down the cost of health care , but you wo n't really be solving problems . " The partnership 's official position is essentially that more public research is great as long as it does n't affect public policy . It 's true that information alone can be helpful . Anesthesiologists sharply reduced mortality rates after their association published evidence-based guidelines ; emergency-room nurses have reduced infection rates by following clinically proven to-do lists . After one pharmacy benefits manager sent letters urging customers with high cholesterol to check out the evidence-based Consumer Reports site Bestbuydrugs.org , 4.3% switched to cheaper but equally effective drugs , for savings of $12 million . Similarly , when doctors and patients are fully educated about the costs and benefits of various treatment options for prostate cancer , surgery rates drop by half . But without incentives to use it , information alone will not lead to reform . Obama wants to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than punished for reducing readmissions and unnecessary procedures . " We ca n't just do research and let it sit on a shelf , " Orszag says . It is fair for industry groups to insist on an independent agency to oversee the effectiveness research , so that decisions about what to study are separate from decisions about what to reimburse . And some of Obama 's quality incentives are fairly straightforward , like extra dollars for primary care , prevention and computerization ; to discourage wasteful defensive medicine , he seems willing to limit malpractice lawsuits when doctors stick to best practices . But ultimately , rewarding quality rather than quantity will require daunting changes in Medicare reimbursement policies . That could mean lower patient costs and higher provider revenues for proven treatments , but when patients want more expensive options unsupported by data , they may have to pay the difference themselves . In the past , industry lobbyists have persuaded Congress to squash even mild reimbursement reforms ; former Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recalls a futile effort to reduce overpayments and promote competition among oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gore anybody 's ox , " Shalala says . " If Congress is going to be involved in the nitty-gritty payment details , reform is dead . " Obama wants to let another independent agency , similar to the military-base-closing commission , recommend how to pay for quality , which would limit political haggling . But even if such a panel focused on clinical effectiveness rather than cost-effectiveness -- so that taxpayers would cover vastly more expensive approaches as long as they were slightly more effective -- the shift would still be dramatic for Medicare , which currently covers just about any possibly effective treatment with virtually no regard for cost . If Medicare takes the lead in reform , private insurers should follow . This would probably qualify as " rationing , " but anyone who 's ever had an insurer refuse to pay for something knows that health care is already rationed , in the sense that you ca n't always get everything you want . Still , oxen would be gored , and the backlash could be nasty . The ultimate success of Obamacare might depend on a cultural change among doctors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't better care . " We 've got this ethos that the best doctors do everything under the sun and rule out every zebra , " Emanuel says . " And hey , they get paid more to do it . But we 've got to change all that .
