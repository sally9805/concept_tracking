There are too many competent interviewers in talk TV . From David Letterman 's grumpy-uncle persona to Jay Leno 's Chamber of Commerce bonhomie to Larry King 's slow-pitched softballs , there are plenty of formats on which guests can happily plug their products or agendas . What TV needs are more bad interviews  --  unpredictable showdowns that do n't glide to a safe three-point landing . <P> Enter Ali G , a tracksuit-wearing " hip-hop journalist " and the alter ego of British comic Sacha Baron Cohen . Da Ali G Show ( HBO , Friday nights , 12:30 a.m . E.T. ) is a little like This Is Spinal Tap , if the doltish rockers were asking the questions . In one of a series of artfully staged ( but real ) newsmaker interviews , Ali asks former U.N . Secretary-General Boutros BoutrosGhali : " Which is the funniest language ? It 's French , in n it ? " When he asks a panel of religious leaders , " Is n't God just an overhyped David Blaine ? " you swear one of the panelists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pop him . <P> What makes Ali ( Mr. G ? ) hilarious is his straight-faced belief that he 's smarter than his subjects . Touring the U.N. , he seizes on a place card reserving a seat for JORDAN . How , he demands , can the body give so much power to one basketball player ? Later he asks why Africa is not represented . Pointing to the G section , an official notes that Guinea is in Africa . " So you claim , " Ali sneers . Check and mate ! <P> Ali G follows Real Time with Bill Maher ( Fridays , 11:30 p.m . E.T. ) , the new vehicle for the pundit manque who expanded the possibilities of the bad chat show with Politically Incorrect , the issue-oriented roundtable that exploited the comic possibilities of letting , say , Tom Arnold hold forth on Kosovo . The live show was not available for preview , but it will in part adapt PI 's discussion format , with more serious guests and fewer B-list stars . That fits the earnest air of Maher-tyrdom the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ controversial post-9/11 charge that the U.S. was cowardly for bombing enemies with cruise missiles . Let 's hope Maher does n't screw up Real Time by making it responsible . <P> Meanwhile , Maher 's replacement at ABC , Jimmy Kimmel Live ( weeknights , 12:05 a.m . E.T. ) is by no conventional measure a good talk show . Kimmel , the former co-host of Comedy Central 's The Man Show , is not a strong interviewer . He does not even seem to like his job ; he trudges into the theater every night like a weary sales rep who ca n't wait for Miller Time . The show 's booking pull is so feeble that , by its third week , Kimmel had his former Man Show partner , Adam Carolla , as co-host.
