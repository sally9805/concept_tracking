THE COUSIN RIVER VILLAGE The old women prepared a separate boiling bag of meat and broth for those three wives in the village who were pregnant : Aqamdax , Star and Red Leaf . Parts of the caribou were taboo for them . The flesh and bones of the neck would cause clumsiness in their unborn children , and the front legs and the meat of the lower jaw and lips must be saved for the old men . Aqamdax knew her baby was a boy . She hid her laughter when other women told her , since she carried the child low , it was a girl . Did she not hear his whispers , the songs he sang into her dreams ? Of course it was a boy . She had known since her fourth moon of pregnancy , when he had first begun moving within her belly . During the past spring , with only six hunters left in their village after the fighting , the men had been unable to take all the caribou they needed , but at least they had killed enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the meat , did not allow one scrap to go to waste . The hides , riddled by the breathing holes of warble fly larvae , were useless for clothing and nearly impossible to scrape , but with their lodges burned and their caches looted , how could the women throw those hides away ? Now at the end of summer , Chakliux and his older brother Sok had taken a fine , fat caribou bull . For one night , the people pushed away their anger , their helplessness , and celebrated with a feast . As Aqamdax ate , she hummed songs to her baby , told him to grow strong like the caribou . Some of her singing was in the River traditionof her husband 's people . But she had learned most of her songs from her own people , the First Men who lived beside the great North Sea . The songs kept her mind busy , kept her thoughts on her child and on her husband , away from the hunter Chakliux , honored as Dzuuggistorytellerof this village . He was young but wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ otters . Who could not see that he carried otter blood , with his left foot bent on edge , his toes webbed ? When everyone had finished eating , and the women had banked the cooking fires into smoke smudges to drive away those night insects that still lingered at the end of summer , then Chakliux and Sok told the story of the hunt . Aqamdax squatted on her haunches , her legs spread to accommodate her growing belly . She caught sight of her husband , Night Man , watching her , and so was careful not to allow her eyes to linger too long on Chakliux . Be grateful for Night Man , Aqamdax told herself . Be thankful you are wife and no longer slave . Find joy in the child he has given you , and honor your husband . She sat with her brother , Ghaden , a boy of five summers , on her right side , Ghaden 's stepsister , Yaa , on her left . Both children had lost their parents and had been adopted by Chakliux 's wife , Star @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made their clothing , prepared their food . Star had taken them on a whim , like a child who chooses to raise a baby fox . Who could trust her to care for two children ? Yaa snuggled close to Aqamdax , but Ghaden was standing , watching with wide eyes as Sok and Chakliux acted out their hunt . Chakliux 's words carried pictures into her mind , and Aqamdax could see the caribou , the white bands that streaked his sides blending with the lights and shadows of the dwarf birches where he stood ; tatters of blood-rich skin hanging from his antlers , the bone-hard tines stained dark as bearberry leaves , autumn red . Then Star pressed herself between Ghaden and Aqamdax , breaking into that vision of caribou . She tilted her chin up as though to challenge Aqamdax , and pulled Ghaden into her lap . He struggled against her , and both began to squabble , first in quiet words , then with rising wails . Aqamdax leaned forward , caught her brother 's eye and raised her fingers to her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in anger but turned back to watch the men . Star gave Aqamdax a smug smile , then leaned close to whisper , " In only a few moons I will have two sons . " She glanced down at Aqamdax 's belly . " At best you will have only one . " Aqamdax closed her eyes to Star 's foolishness and did not answer . She could only pity Chakliux 's child , asleep in the hard cradle of Star 's bones . In one evening of feasting , the caribou was gone , save for the broth that could still be boiled from skull and ribs . The words and songs of the hunters ' stories drifted up until the night air thinned them like smoke , and they floated above the sleeping village , until the people called them back through their dreams . Aqamdax slept , warm in her hare fur blankets on the women 's side of Star 's lodge . Beside her , old Long Eyes slept . Long Eyes was Star and Night Man 's mother , and since her husband 's death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had followed her husband into the world of the dead . Often she stayed awake through the night , moaning strange songs , but a full belly had lulled her into sleep . Aqamdax 's thoughts grew into pictures , and she was with her husband , Night Man , when Chakliux and Sok brought their caribou into the village . Night Man was scowling , his useless arm bound to his body with strips of caribou hide . Aqamdax kept her eyes from Chakliux . Night Man was watching her , as he always did when Chakliux was near . She turned her head to look at her husband , smiled and leaned toward him until her hip touched his . There were many small ways to show a husband respect , ways that would not embarrass him in front of other men . Aqamdax 's dreams changed to remembrances of her life as a child , when she had lived with the First Men near the great North Sea . Her father was still alive , and he picked her up , his hands around her waist . Suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She cried for him to stop , then looked down and saw that he was dead , his skin dark , his lips as blue as they had been when he had drowned . She heard her mother wail out in a terrible mourning cry , and her voice was so loud that it woke Aqamdax . Star and Yaa were beside her . " You screamed , " Yaa said . " What 's the matter ? " Aqamdax shook her head , tried to break the last threads that bound her into sleep . " Just a dream , " she said , then gasped as the pain took her again , circling her hips and pressing into her bones . Star drew away , her hands over the small mound that was her baby . " Get her out of here , " she told Yaa . " Her child might call mine to come . " Star backed into the far side of the lodge , paying no heed that she walked over her husband 's bed to get there . Chakliux raised up on one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Aqamdax . " What is wrong ? " he asked . Star pointed rudely with her thumbs . " She , her baby . It is wanting to be born . " Chakliux wrapped a sleeping robe around his shoulders and crept to Night Man . Chakliux shook him until he was awake . " Your wife 's child is trying to be born , " Chakliux said . " I will go get my aunt . " The pain eased , and Aqamdax was able to speak . " It is early . The baby should not come for more than a moon , " she said . " Go to your birth lodge . I will bring Ligige ' , " said Chakliux . " I have no birth lodge . " What woman would prepare her lodge a full moon before delivery ? Why tempt a child to come into the world when he is not strong enough to survive ? " Go to Red Leaf 's . Hers is ready , is it not ? " Aqamdax nodded . Another pain took her , and she squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to go to Red Leaf 's lodge , but how could she object ? She could not stay here , cursing the men and their weapons , and perhaps Star 's unborn baby . Red Leaf had killed Aqamdax 's mother and Chakliux 's grandfather . She had tried to kill Ghaden . How could Aqamdax use a birth lodge made by a woman whose heart was stained with blood ? With Yaa 's help , Aqamdax managed to stumble from the lodge , but just outside the entrance tunnel , she felt the beginning of another pain . She squatted on her haunches , and before the pain tore away her breath , told Yaa to go back and get the cradleboard she had made and the hare furs she had prepared . Yaa left her , and just as the pain eased , she returned with the cradleboard and furs . She helped Aqamdax to her feet , then they walked to the edge of the village . When they reached the isolated place where Red Leaf had made her birth lodge , Aqamdax could see it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' to the lodge , but how could the old woman have started a fire so quickly ? Someone called . Chakliux , Aqamdax thought , and she was surprised . Most men stayed as far as possible from a woman about to deliver a child . A woman 's power was great at such times , and even though she meant no harm , that power could destroy a man 's hunting luck . " I can not find Ligige ' , " Chakliux said . The old woman popped her head out of the birth lodge . " Someone else wants me ? " she asked . Then , seeing Aqamdax , she frowned . " You , too ? " A pain took her , so Aqamdax could do no more than crouch and brace herself , but she listened as Yaa and Ligige ' spoke . " I have Red Leaf here , " Ligige ' said . " It will be some time before her baby is born . When did Aqamdax 's pains begin ? " " Only a little while ago , " Yaa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain chasing another . " " That happens sometimes when a baby comes early , " Ligige ' told her . " We can not have both women in the same lodge . One child 's death could curse the other 's birth . " Ligige ' ' s words pierced Aqamdax 's heart . How could the woman speak so lightly of the child Aqamdax had grown to love more than her own life ? " Take her to my lodge , " Ligige ' said . " I will come as soon as I can . " She ducked her head back inside , but then she peeked out again . " On your way , wake Day Woman and tell her to come here . She will not want to , but remind her that Red Leaf 's child also belongs to her son Sok . " Chakliux saw Yaa leave his mother 's lodge , saw his mother walk the path to the birth hut . Aqamdax stopped once , stooped over in pain , then continued to Ligige ' ' s lodge and slipped inside . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walls , and Chakliux 's thoughts turned to his first wife , Gguzaakk . For a long time after her death , Chakliux could find no reason to live save his duties as Dzuuggi and his desire to keep peace between the Cousin and Near River Peoples , but then he had decided to live in the Near River Village and Aqamdax had come into his life . She was a storyteller , trained in the traditions of the First Men , and Chakliux had grown to love her , had decided to ask her to be his wife . What could be better than two storytellers living together , learning from one another ? But the trader Cen had stolen Aqamdax , taken her to the Cousin River Village and sold her as a slave . Before Chakliux could find where Cen had taken her , Night Man bought Aqamdax as wife , and now Aqamdax labored to deliver Night Man 's child . Chakliux shook his head . Night Man was as foolish as his sister Star . He was worried about whether Aqamdax 's child belonged to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she was a slave . If the baby was born large and strong , it was not Night Man 's , though he would be wise to raise the child as his own . If it was smalla sign it had been born earlyit was certainly his child but would probably die . Chakliux was not wise enough to know which way he should praythere would be sadness if the child lived or if it died . Instead he prayed for Aqamdax . That she would live . How could he bear to again lose a woman he loved ? Snow-in-her-hair offered Sok a bowl of soup , and he lashed out at her in harsh words . The thin , nearly meatless broth added to his anger . Any wife should be ashamed to offer her husband such poor food . What happened to the caribou belly they had roasted whole , full of the tender summer plants the animal had been eating before Sok and Chakliux had killed it ? What happened to the rich broth made from the head ? Surely , some of that was left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again he threw harsh words at his wife , but when he saw his son Cries-loud press himself up against the side of the lodge , he was suddenly ashamed of his anger . It was not the broth that tortured his soul but the birth of Red Leaf 's child . He would keep the baby if it was healthy , but what about Red Leaf ? She had cost Sok the leadership of the Near River People . Someday , he would have been their chief hunter , and Chakliux had held an honored place as storyteller . Together they would have guided the people , turned them from war toward ways of respect , but Red Leaf had destroyed any chance of that when she killed his grandfather . Now Sok lived in exile , forced , because of what his wife had done , to leave the village of his birth . Red Leaf was alive now only because she carried Sok 's baby . She had claimed that she killed out of love for him , to give him the chance to have his grandfather 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was nearly as guilty of the killing as Red Leaf . But he would have never wished for his grandfather 's death . During all the moons awaiting this night of birth , Sok had been unable to decide what he should do . Now , without doubt , in the remnants of the Cousin River Village , he was chief hunter . There was little honor in it , but still the people looked to him to provide food . They faced a harsh winter . Their only hope of survival was a successful fall caribou hunt . If he killed Red Leaf , would her blood keep the animals from giving themselves to his spear ? If he did not kill Red Leaf , would his grandfather 's need for revenge turn the caribou from the Cousin River hunters ?
