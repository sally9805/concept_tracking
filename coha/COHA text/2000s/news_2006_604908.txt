<p> WILMINGTON , Vt.  --  The wind whips up in Dale Doucette 's expansive backyard , furiously spinning the blades on his 80-foot-tall silver wind turbine and leaving a broad smile on his square-jawed face . <p> The gusts nudge the voltage on his battery bank and help power Doucette 's wood-carving saw , as well as the PC , printer and recessed lights in his wife Michele 's home-based chiropractic office . <p> But overcast skies mean the Doucettes ' 10 solar panels wo n't be as productive as usual . So his two teenage sons can use the computer but not the TV or GameCube . <p> " I 'm the power Nazi , " Doucette , 47 , says as the turbine blades emit a shrill hum on a late March afternoon . <p> The Doucettes live off the power grid , but they 're far from granola-crunching hippies eking out a bare-bones existence in the hinterlands . They live in a sleek $500,000 plaster-and-tile house a quarter mile from electric lines and could have hooked in for $10,000 . Instead , they opted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ systems . <p> " We want to be as self-sustaining as possible and get out from under Big Brother , " Doucette says . " I enjoy not getting an electric bill . " <p> Amid soaring electricity prices , the renewable energy industry is increasingly being driven by families such as the Doucettes who choose to be off the grid for environmental or political reasons and by a much faster-rising number of Americans adding solar and wind systems to grid-connected houses . Such equipment used to be bought almost exclusively by off-the-gridders in remote rural reaches who could n't afford fees of $30,000 or more to tie in to electric lines . <p> Now , in 27 states , homeowners on the grid can get state rebates or tax breaks that subsidize up to 50% or more of the cost of clean energy systems . They then sell the electricity they generate , but do n't use themselves , to utilities , offsetting the cost of the power they draw from the grid as they spin their meters backward and drive their electric bills toward zero . <p> Seventeen states @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ customers rebates on the purchase and installation of solar or wind systems , up from three in 2000 . Florida and Pennsylvania are among those considering rebates . Meanwhile , the number of states with " net metering " laws  --  which permit customers to sell the power they produce to the electric utility at retail rates  --  has nearly doubled to 36 in the past six years . <p> Despite a hodgepodge of state laws , the trend points up a budding grass-roots movement to displace at least some of the nation 's power generation from pollution-belching plants to small , clean neighborhood nodes . That eases strains on transmission lines . Some 180,000 families live off-grid , a figure that has jumped 33% a year for a decade , says Richard Perez , publisher of Home Power magazine . <p> Yet , thanks to the incentives , another 27,000 grid-connected houses supplement the utility 's power with their own energy systems , most of which are solar , says the Interstate Renewable Energy Council and the American Wind Energy Association . Perez expects the number of utility customers using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> " It 's accelerating very quickly , " says Michael Eckhart , of the American Council on Renewable Energy . <p> The movement got an added jolt in January when utility customers could start taking advantage of a new $2,000 federal tax credit for solar power system purchases as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 . <p> After soaring 30% a year the past five years , sales of solar , or photovoltaic , systems could ratchet even higher this year . Bob-O Schultze , owner of Electron Connection in Northern California , says solar sales have risen 50% annually since 2002 . About 75% of his business is from on-grid customers , vs. just 1% four years ago . <p> Off the grid <p> For decades , dealers in small solar and wind systems depended on the small band of mavericks who moved off the grid to live in the countryside , where land is plentiful and inexpensive . California , Washington , Oregon , Colorado , Vermont and Maine have long been havens , though people live off the grid in almost every state . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no close neighbors and the only land they can afford is beyond the reaches of the grid , " Perez , an off-gridder himself , says . Property without utility hook-ups , he adds , can cost about a third less than a standard lot . These days , a growing number of off-gridders could link up fairly cheaply but prefer to be untethered for myriad reasons , including rising electricity rates , a desire to cut power plant pollution and concerns about blackouts or terrorism . <p> The Wilmington area , in rural southern Vermont , nestled at the foothills of the Green Mountains is speckled with off-grid homes on back roads where the area 's criss-crossing power lines do n't reach . <p> Doucette , a wood carver , and some friends built his 3,200-square-foot house four years ago on a 22-acre , tree-rimmed property , moving from a smaller grid-tied house a few miles away . Considering his old electric bill ran to $1,700 a year and was certain to go higher , Doucette figures his green energy system will pay for itself in 20 years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> " We made a conscious choice not to get on the grid , " Doucette says , noting he has long been rankled by the electricity price increases of the local resort town during ski season and by periodic winter blackouts . <p> Like other off-gridders , Doucette uses his gleaming blue solar panels on the roof of a small shed about 150 feet from his house , as his main energy source . The turbine , another 300 feet away , provides added juice on cloudy days when the wind is swirling . <p> The power generated by both solar and wind systems is stored in 24 batteries in a bin in the shed . An inverter converts the DC current produced by the systems to the AC current used in homes . The batteries could last several days in the unlikely event there is neither sun nor wind . A backup propane generator kicks in if the batteries get low . <p> Like other clean-energy homes , Doucette 's two-story , earth-toned house is built for conservation , with energy-efficient refrigerator and dishwasher , low-voltage light bulbs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Nat Tappan live in an older-style off-grid home , about 21/2 miles up a hill off a dirt road on an isolated 90-acre tract . The rustic , timber-frame house , which sits next to a pasture with sheep and chickens , has a composting toilet and no running water ( they have a well ) . Sunny and her former husband bought the property 18 years ago and spent a few thousand dollars on a solar power system . Connecting to the power grid would have cost $80,000 , but Sunny , 53 , had no interest anyway . <p> " I love living off the grid and being independent , " she says . " I wanted to live on a large piece of property out in the country . " <p> Four small solar panels angled on brackets in a garden few feet from the back door supply 680 watts of power . But noting she has no TV , dishwasher or washing machine , Sunny says that 's more than enough , " We use very little electricity . " And if it 's persistently cloudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she says . <p> For others , living off the grid is a matter of principle . Maynard Kaufman , 77 , who lives in a saltbox house on a farm near Bangor , Mich. , could have connected to the grid for $10,000 . Instead , he spent $30,000 on a solar power system and $12,700 on two wind turbines . Noting he had demonstrated in front of the local nuclear plant , he said , " It was totally a matter of conscience . " <p> On the grid <p> For many utility customers , installing an alternative energy system largely boils down to the dollars and cents that state incentives help them save . <p> California was the first state to offer a generous package of renewable-energy incentives for homes and businesses in the late 1990s as power companies were deregulated . It 's blessed with abundant sunshine and plagued by high electric rates and an overtaxed grid that led to rolling blackouts . <p> By 2002 , California was offering households 60% rebates on solar power systems , as well as tax credits , letting homeowners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of their solar energy into the grid during the day when they 're not home , easing peak demands , and draw from it at night when the sun is n't shining . <p> Demand for solar power has surged , with about 15,000 utility customers installing systems , and last year the state cut the rebate to 35% . The goal is to use rebates to drive so much demand that solar prices plunge , and the rebates can be phased out . But a worldwide shortage of solar panels , spurred by even-more-generous incentives in Japan and Germany , is keeping prices high until more factories are built in 18 months . <p> New Jersey is the only other state with a solar incentive program to match California 's . Rebates cover more than 50% of a solar power system 's cost . Plus , households can sell credits for the energy they produce to utilities to meet state clean energy quotas . The program " helps reduce peak demands , and that helps dramatically , " says Jeanne Fox , president of the New Jersey Board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ generation and a lot of that is to be distributed " in neighborhoods to improve power-plant reliability and security . <p> Other states with rebate programs include New York , Massachusetts , Illinois and Rhode Island , where electricity prices are high . <p> Clark Beebe , 57 , of Springfield , N.J. , bought a $50,000 solar power system two years ago for $15,000 after rebates , installing it on the roof of his four-bedroom house . Because he offsets what he uses with what he pumps into the grid , his annual power bill has dropped from $1,270 to $170 , though he also installed energy-saving appliances . His $1,100 yearly savings is supplemented by $500 in clean energy credits , cutting the payback period for his system to nine years . After that , he 'll effectively net at least a $200-a-year profit . " I am now an electricity company , " says Beebe 57 . " Plus , I 'm generating electricity without any pollutants . " <p> Carrie Buczeke , 42 , of Livermore , Calif. , rolled the cost of her $54,000 solar panels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home-equity loan . She has wiped out her $400 monthly electric bill and pays $300 a month for the loan . After seven years , the loan will be paid off . " It was such a no-brainer , " she says .
