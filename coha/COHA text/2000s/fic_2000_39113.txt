THE BANKS WERE DOOMED . Harbert Little knew that beyond a shadow of a doubt . And without the banks , everything else would fail  --  the stock markets , of course , but also the government and then the power company , the water and sewer , law and order , and most importantly the gas stations . People said stored gasoline soured after a few months , but sour gas was better than none , and Harbert already had a half dozen fifty-five-gallon blue plastic drums of gas stored behind his metal shed . A few months ago , Harbert had loaded the first of the blue barrels onto his homemade trailer and pulled into the Total station , but before he 'd even pumped a gallon , the attendant had run out of the building , yelling that the drum was not " an approved container , " and so , ever since , Harbert had been filling the tank of his Country Squire and siphoning the gas into the barrels , which he concealed under an old army canvas . He was starting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bury any further barrels so nobody could stumble across them . One drum had begun to bulge , so Harbert had clamped a metal strap around it-he 'd take fuel out of that one first . No amount of gasoline would be enough , of course , but he figured that if he did n't drive much-and after the collapse , he would n't be going around fixing people 's washing machines  --  he 'd need only a few gallons per day to power his generator . <p> Harbert Little liked the tall , smiling man whose washing-machine belt he 'd just replaced , and that was why he decided to make a suggestion . " You ought to get yourself some gasoline stored away now , " said Harbert . " It 's going to be impossible to get after the new year . " <p> " We 're not worried about the Y2K thing , " he replied . <p> Harbert figured the man was about half his age , which might explain why he was naive about the situation-young people went along thinking that nothing bad could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car crash so bad that blood would stain the asphalt for months . They did n't know Satan could move among us in the form of a building inspector or a frisky squirrel . It never occurred to young people that the world could descend into darkness and chaos , leaving every man to fend for himself . " Well , you should prepare just in case , " said Harbert . " I 've got some gas put away , and I 'm even ordering live chickens from Farm &; Fleet so I 'll have eggs . " Actually , Harbert was not looking forward to raising chickens in his shed . He did n't like the idea of having to feed and water critters every day , not to mention figuring out what to do if they got sick . But , as he was trying to make this tall , smiling man realize , a person had to prepare . The millennium problem was like religion . Harbert 's father the minister used to say that though you could n't force anyone to believe in Our Lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love Jesus , just in case he had overlooked the importance of everything the Bible said ; Harbert hoped further that accepting Jesus would help a man recognize the way banks and Jews and the government were plotting together to deny the impending Y2K disaster . <p> " We think it 's a lot of fuss about nothing , " said the tall , smiling man . <p> " Do you trust in Jesus ? " asked Harbert . <p> " We 're not religious . " <p> Harbert stood there in the man 's yard listening to birds singing . Harbert suffered from the same degenerative eye disease that bad afflicted his father , and it had progressed in the last several years so that Harbert had to wear telescopic glasses for driving , and without them he saw birds as nothing other than shadowy , fluttering movement . It occurred to Harbert that birds must really like people , because you did n't hear birds out in the country near as much as you heard them here in town . Here in Bee Baw Township Center , before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may they rest in peace , Harbert had heard chirping and singing from morning till night . The old next-door neighbor , Em Garrity , had gone outside every day in pink slippers and a quilted bathrobe to put sunflower seed in a feeder shaped like a hay barn with a silo . She 'd expressed surprise that Harbert wanted to sell the house where he 'd lived his whole life , and he replied that he did n't like selling but had to prepare for the millennium , as she ought to be doing too . Ein said , " You 're a fool , Harbert , " and dismissed him with a wave of her hand . At Harbert 's new property , twenty-two miles outside town , there were no neighbors in sight and Harbert rarely heard any birds . <p> The tall , smiling man 's wife came out of the house with their baby strapped onto her back , and she walked right past Harbert , close enough that even without his glasses he could make out the expression on the baby 's face-the baby had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth before disappearing into blurriness . Harbert felt bad that the parents were not taking precautions , if only for the sake of that child . <p> " You ought to withdraw your money from the bank , " said Harbert . " Did you know that the bank 's only got a dollar seventeen cents for every hundred dollars on deposit ? " <p> " I did n't know that , " said the man . The sun was shining through a big tree 's branches , lighting up his hair . <p> " Most people do n't know . " Harbert reached up and scratched his head , which was nearly as bald as the baby 's . " Everything else-that ninety-eight-plus dollars-is loaned out . " Harbert did n't want to scare the man too much , but he knew that if a couple of rich guys went to the bank in Bee Baw and asked for all their money in cash , the vault would be cleaned out , and they 'd have to close their doors , which would make angry people line up outside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have anything in the bank-he 'd gotten money from selling the house in Bee Baw but spent everything on the ten acres north of town , on the pole barn he now used for a house , on the shed , the generator , and the windmill he 'd ordered but had n't yet received . Probably the banks would fail before the new year because people would withdraw their money at , say , the end of November , and then the government would struggle for two or three weeks before collapsing . Harbert heard on the Faith Channel that the government was printing all kinds of money-increasing the supply by 50 percent-but that was n't going to be enough . The banks were doomed . <p> " Did you know we get 90 percent of our gasoline from overseas ? " asked Harbert . <p> " Nope . I did n't know that either . " The man was still smiling , apparently still not realizing the gravity of the situation . <p> " The seaports are the least prepared of all . That 's why there wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boats full of foreign oil would be floating aimlessly , their captains not knowing where they 'd go even if their controls had n't gone haywire . Our nuclear submarines might launch missiles by accident and blow the ships up , or the Russians might launch missiles and pretend they did it by accident . Russians and Chinese would likely invade us as they 've wanted to do all these years . Russians and Chinese were accustomed to chaos , and with our government collapsed they could finally dominate us . They 'd try to make everybody renounce Jesus , but they would n't succeed with Harbert Little . No , Harbert knew that hellfire was worse than any pain on this earth , and his belief in Jesus was his ultimate survival tool . <p> In addition to Jesus and the generator and gasoline , Harbert had a chain saw , sharp knives , a spare set of prescription telescopic glasses , a solar-powered hot-water tank , and sixteen books on survival , including an out-of-print pamphlet from the U.S. Army detailing which bugs and plants were edible . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beans because he was waiting until the last minute for optimum freshness . He did n't want to eat rice and beans , but there probably would n't be any other food after hunger-crazed mobs broke the plate-glass windows and emptied the shelves of Meijer 's Thrifty Acres and Harding 's Friendly Market . <p> " Well , I hope you change your mind before the new year , " said Harbert , " for the sake of that baby . " <p> " How much do I owe you ? " asked the tall , smiling man . <p> " Twenty dollars . " Harbert accepted the single bill . " Do you want a receipt ? " <p> " Naw . " The man reached out to shake hands . " And thanks for coming out right away . " <p> As Harbert walked toward his car , he made out the figure of the woman kneeling by the driveway-weeding flowerbeds , it looked like , which would explain the sweet smell of their yard . The woman was facing away from Harbert , and he could have sworn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little jumping motion as though he wanted to leap into Harbert 's arms for safety . <p> Though he 'd never gardened , Harbert would take this twenty dollars to the Farm &; Fleet and buy nonhybrid seed corn to plant next spring to grow more feed for the chickens . He 'd have to eat the roosters , he 'd been told , or the hens would n't lay eggs . Harbert had never killed anything face to face before , and he was n't looking forward to it . He 'd been meaning to buy a gun , a shotgun probably , and a couple thousand rounds of ammunition . Though he 'd never fired anything more powerful than a pellet gun , and that when he was a boy , he thought he might be able to shoot at unruly people if they came out to his place and threatened to steal his gasoline or generator or chickens . He knew it was un-Christian to think about killing folks . It was better not to plan on it but just to act in self-defense in the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , put on his telescopic glasses , and fastened his safety belt . Saving yourself was something you had to do on your own . If this young couple with the baby did n't even believe in Jesus yet , they were probably doomed . Unless they started right away , there would n't be enough time for them both to start believing and to make preparations for the end . A Faith Channel minister had prepared viewers for Armageddon two years ago , but that had been based on mistaken information given him by the Catholics , he said , and the minister himself had reinterpreted Nostradamus 's predictions and said that the end was rescheduled for the coming year . Most righteous people were saying that if Y2K did n't destroy us , doomsday would be next September , but Harbert had heard a late-night minister explain how " sept " meant " seven , " so maybe doomsday would come in the seventh month , July . At that time , the minister predicted , a meteor a quarter-mile across would plunge into the North Atlantic , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England , and then would go underneath the North Pole-probably crack it up or push it partway around the world-and worst of all , the force would bust open all the refineries in England and Ireland and send flaming oil out onto the sea , so that all the way to America the ocean would be on fire , and one by one the tankers would explode and nuclear submarines would spit missiles at populated land masses . <p> Of course , Harbert Little would be OK in that extreme circumstance because Jesus would carry all believers to safety . Or if a mob who 'd already broken the plate-glass windows and cleared out the shelves of Meijer 's and Harding 's showed up at his property with their torches and pistols , Harbert would n't leave his pole barn . He had faith that when the situation looked hopeless , Jesus would lift him and his barn right up into the sky , float it into the clouds like a balloon and up even further to the Kingdom of God , where He would set it down again gently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other houses , but not far away , either , from the other Men of God who had prepared for the end . Harbert would be pleasantly surprised if he were set down near a Faith Channel minister , or near his father , and possibly somewhere near the baby and the woman and the tall , smiling man , who seemed to be waving good-bye now from his yard . Harbert lifted his arm and waved back . Up in heaven , when Harbert opened his reinforced  --  steel-and-aluminum , solid-core front door into the New Holy Universe , he hoped he 'd smell flowers . He knew that he 'd hear the sweet voices of birds and angels . <p>
