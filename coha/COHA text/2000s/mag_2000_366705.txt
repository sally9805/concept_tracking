Just do n't take any course where they make you read Beowulf , " Woody Allen advised Diane Keaton in Annie Hall ( 1977 ) . The throwaway line elicited laughs from Allen 's core audience of college grads , especially the one-time English majors among them who had learned to dread  --  if not actually read  --  what they had heard was a grim Anglo-Saxon epic filled with odd names and a lot of gory hewing and hacking . <P> The joke , it turns out , was on the chucklers . In January , a British panel chose Beowulf for the Whitbread Award as the best book of 1999 , with J.K. Rowling 's Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban running a close second . But these judges , of course , did not suddenly come to their senses about the merits of a manuscript composed sometime late in the first millennium . They gave their prize  --  and an instant spot at the top of British best-seller lists  --  to a new verse translation of Beowulf by the Irish poet Seamus Heaney , winner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Beowulf ( Farrar , Straus &; Giroux ; 219 pages ; $25 ) has now been published in the U.S. , giving American readers the chance to take the measure of this Harry Potter slayer , the deadest white European male in the politically incorrect literary canon . Judging by the electronic-sales ratings updated constantly by Amazon.com Beowulf is becoming boffo on this side of the Atlantic as well . <P> Credit for this surge of interest should rest squarely on the marvelous language that Heaney has found to set this old warhorse of a saga running again . All translations , especially of poetry , involve constant compromises between sense and sound , between the literal meanings of the original words and the unique music to which they were set . The Anglo-Saxon idiom of Beowulf sounds particularly alien to modern ears : four stresses per line , separated in the middle by a strong pause , or caesura , with the third stress in each line alliterating with one or both of the first two . Heaney follows these rules to the letter in such lines as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The shepherd of people was sheared of his life . " But he also regularly works supple variations on this pattern , letting the Anglo-Saxon rhythms echo as an undercurrent in lines that would seem , in another context , almost prosaic : " She turned then to the bench where her boys sat . " <P> Much that seemed off-putting about Beowulf to modern readers becomes , in Heaney 's retelling , eerily intriguing instead . Yes , the Scandinavian hero kills three monsters : a scaly maneater called Grendel ( Beowulf rips off the creature 's right arm at the shoulder ) ; Grendel 's aggrieved mother ; and , 50 years later , a fire-breathing dragon that mortally wounds Beowulf before expiring . But these bloody deeds actually occupy fairly few of the epic 's 3,182 lines . The Beowulf poet , who is recounting legends that were passed down orally from several centuries earlier , is interested less in violence , which appears to be inescapable in the world he portrays , than in the workings of fate ( wyrd ) in human lives .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
