The front door of the palace opens , and out comes King Mohammed VI with a feline bounce in his step . After quick introductions and a handshake , he smiles and gets to the point . " Shall we go ? " he asks in slightly accented English . The interview , it seems , will have to wait . He 's wearing a metallic gray muscle shirt , navy running shorts , white socks and a pair of emerald Nikes . The thin crescent of a new moon is hanging over the medieval city of Marrakech . Morocco 's 36-year-old monarch is ready to jog . <P> The King leaps behind the wheel of his black custom-crafted Carlsson Mercedes . Since becoming head of state a year ago , he explains as he steers into traffic through the huge gate in the palace 's high , ocher-colored rampart , he has gone on living the regular life he tried to live as Crown Prince . " People are not shocked at all when they see me driving my own car , " he says . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not doing it . I have n't changed anything , except I moved into a bigger office . " <P> As we cruise the streets , the King stops for red lights , giving a shy wave whenever pedestrians or other motorists excitedly spot him . He pulls out a pack of Marlboros and jokes , his brown eyes devilishly twinkling , " I guess I should n't smoke before jogging , eh ? " Outside the city , we stop on a country lane as an unmarked security car that has been following us at a discreet distance pulls up . Then we are off for the five-mile run , the King slowing his pace and shortening his circuit in kindness to an older , nonjogging journalist .

Here is Mohammed VI , this week making a state visit to Washington aimed at renewing warm ties that date to 1777 , when Morocco was among the first nations to recognize the United States of America . <P> When Mohammed VI succeeded his father , foreign diplomats were not alone in wondering what to expect . During Hassan II 's reign , people quipped about Prince One Step  --  meaning the boy who stood a pace behind his father , rarely speaking , quietly learning statecraft . In the past year he has turned in a stunning performance . His subjects have watched in amazement as he boldly axed his father 's powerful old cronies , freed political prisoners and plunged like a pop star into crowds of adoring Moroccans . <P> One thing the King has not done is speak to the press , foreign or Moroccan  --  until last week , when he agreed to let TIME follow him on his peripatetic journeys and do the first interview of his reign . During the jog and more formal talks at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rabat , he came off as confident yet modest , part regal , part ordinary guy . Combining a common touch with strategic vision , he may be the most impressive of the new generation coming to power in the Middle East . Moroccans are calling him M6 for short , and King of the Poor  --  good omens , considering the immense task he faces of finding jobs for those in a poor country where almost three-quarters of the population is even younger than he is.
