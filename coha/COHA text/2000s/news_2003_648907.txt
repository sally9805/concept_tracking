<p> Major League Baseball , which has labored for several seasons under suspicion that some of its star players were using steroids , said Thursday that in the first year of testing for steroids more than 5 percent of players ' tests were positive . As a result , stricter testing standards will go into effect next year . <p> From 5 to 7 percent of the 1,438 random , anonymous tests of players on major league teams ' 40-man rosters this year were positive , baseball said , triggering testing for the 2004 season that could result in penalties against players . The players would also be identified publicly . <p> Though the number of positive tests ranged from 70 to 100 , it was unclear how many players tested positive . Of the 1,438 tests , 240 were repeat tests , and so some players may have tested positive twice . <p> The steroid issue has intensified for baseball since two former Most Valuable Players , Ken Caminiti and Jose Canseco , said in 2002 that they used them and that many other players did , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by hitters added to the suspicion that some players might be using performance-enhancing drugs . <p> Baseball 's team owners began a push for testing , but the players ' union was reluctant before agreeing to the program last year , when a new labor contract was signed . <p> " Hopefully , this will , over time , allow us to completely eradicate the use of performance enhancement substances in baseball , " Commissioner Bud Selig said in a statement . <p> But Dr. Gary I. Wadler , a professor of medicine at New York University who is an expert on performance-enhancing drugs , noted that if the 70 to 100 positive tests were grouped together , they would exceed the number of players on the 40-man roster of any of baseball 's 30 teams . This seems to indicate that steroid use was widespread , he said , calling into question the legitimacy of baseball players ' recent achievements . <p> " That 's really a very sorry day for baseball , " Dr. Wadler said . <p> As part of the labor agreement concluded last year , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' union agreed to the anonymous testing for 2003 . Because the positive test results exceeded the 5 percent threshold , the agreement calls for all players to undergo stricter testing starting on March 2 , 2004 . If the number had been less than 5 percent , the same survey testing would have been repeated next year . <p> Until agreeing to testing last year , the players union had been opposed to it on the grounds that it infringed on players ' privacy rights . <p> The new testing plan will be in effect for 2004 and 2005 . Unless the combined positive rate is less than 2.5 percent in those years , it will also be in place in 2006 . <p> The announcement comes at a time when two of baseball 's biggest stars , Barry Bonds and Jason Giambi , have been called to testify before a federal grand jury in California in the investigation of a company suspected of making steroids . Bonds and Giambi have said they received only nutritional supplements from the company . <p> Beginning next season , the first time a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the substance that was abused and be subject to further testing . A second positive will result in the player 's being identified publicly and include a 15-day suspension or up to a $10,000 fine . The penalties escalate to a one-year suspension or up to a $100,000 fine for the fifth positive test . Suspensions will be without pay . <p> " If it 's something that will ultimately make the problem go away or speculation of a problem go away , then what 's wrong with that ? " said Mets pitcher Tom Glavine , the National Leaguers ' representative during the negotiations last year . <p> Players had no specific knowledge of when they would be tested , but they knew since the collective bargaining agreement was reached on Sept. 30 , 2002 , that tests would be administered at some point this season . Billy Beane , the general manager of the Oakland Athletics , said it probably surprised him that players tested positive despite having at least four months ' advance knowledge that testing was imminent . <p> " It 's good that there 's been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Both sides have agreed there should be attention paid . This is the result of it . " <p> The tests were conducted in two phases , with 1,198 players on the 40-man major league rosters being tested at unscheduled times beginning in spring training and continuing throughout the season . In addition , 240 players were randomly selected and tested a second time . Baseball wanted all players to think there was a chance they would be tested a second time and hoped the testing itself would deter steroid use . <p> " A positive rate of 5 percent is hardly the sign that you have rampant use of anything , " said Rob Manfred , baseball 's executive vice president for labor relations . " From our perspective , it 's still a problem . We 'd like it to be at zero . " <p> Gene Orza , the associate general counsel of the players ' union , calculated that between 42 and 83 players had tested positive . When asked about the fact that players knew the tests were coming and some still tested positive , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been 790 without the program ? That 's a pretty good program . " <p> Mr. Orza said the results were " much , much less than anyone would have expected " and indicated that survey testing was successful in trying to stem steroid use . " It showed that the leading players in the game , the 25-man rosters , steroid use is hardly rampant , " he said . <p> That 5 to 7 percent of players tested positive hardly means that only 5 to 7 percent use banned substances , scientists said . Baseball 's survey testing program did not meet the standards of what would be considered meaningful screening , like the year-round , random , unannounced testing used by sports affiliated with the Olympics , Dr. Wadler said . <p> Scientists also noted that players could have used steroids in the off-season , when they knew they would not be tested , and stopped several weeks before spring training , when testing began . This could have provided them with the muscle-building effects of steroids while allowing time for detectable amounts of the drug to leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ players were told to expect to be tested beginning in spring training , failing a drug test amounted to flunking an IQ test , Dr. Wadler said . At the Olympics , 1 to 2 percent of drug screens are expected to turn up positive . That 5 to 7 percent of baseball players tested positive may indicate a lack of sophistication about drug use compared with track and field and professional football , said Dr. Charles Yesalis , a Penn State expert on steroids . <p> " There must be a lot of stupid baseball players , " he said . <p> The National Football League , the National Basketball Association and the National Collegiate Athletic Association test for steroids and other banned substances ; the National Hockey League does not . For substances other than steroids , baseball tests a player only if doctors say there is cause . <p> When baseball 's drug testing was first announced , it was widely criticized by drug-testing experts as being too lenient . But Mr. Manfred said recently that the implementation of this form of testing would give baseball " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Mr. Manfred would not disclose which steroids were found to be more prevalent . Tetrahydrogestrinone , or THG , a steroid that was not detectable until recently , has been added to the list of Schedule B steroids that Mr. Manfred said were banned . Side effects of steroids include liver tumors , high blood pressure and reproductive problems . <p> Dick Pound , a Montreal lawyer who is chairman of the World Anti-Doping Agency , said he thought baseball 's steroid use would have been higher than the tests indicated . <p> " I would have thought it would have been more use than that , but even by baseball 's own tally , even with their heads buried in the sand , they have got to acknowledge there 's a drug problem and go to another level of testing , " he said . <p> Dr. Wadler said baseball should contract out its drug-testing program to an independent agency , such as the World Anti-Doping Agency . <p> While baseball would like the number of positive tests to be zero , Mr. Manfred said he thought scientists were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our program stacks up well with what is actually done in the Olympics as opposed to what they like to depict their program as , " he said . <p> URL : http : //www.nytimes.com
