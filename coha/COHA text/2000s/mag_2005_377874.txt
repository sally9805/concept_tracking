Shirley Franklin is n't standard mayor material . For starters , she 's a woman , which makes her the first female mayor Atlanta has ever had ; in fact , she 's the first black woman ever to run a big Southern city . All of 5 ft. 1 in. tall , Franklin is a divorced mother of three who dyes her hair platinum blond . Before she campaigned for mayor , Franklin had never run for an elected office . Outkast played at her inauguration . <P> When Franklin took office in 2002 , Atlanta needed somebody a little out of the ordinary . Her predecessor , Bill Campbell , had completely blown the public 's trust in city government . Two of his top aides pleaded guilty to charges of bribery , and Campbell is awaiting trial on a seven-count indictment for , among other things , bribery , tax fraud and corruption . Franklin inherited an $82 million budget deficit , which was about 20% of the entire city budget and $37 million more than she had been led to expect . Atlanta 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fraying , the streets had not been maintained in eight years , and the sewers were leaking so badly that state and federal environmental agencies were fining Atlanta $20,000 a day . <P> How did Franklin respond ? She started by committing what might have been political suicide . She cut 1,000 jobs from the city payroll and got the city council to approve a 1% sales-tax hike and a 50% bump to property taxes . To prove she could take it as well as dish it out , she laid off half her staff and cut her own salary by $40,000 . <P> To restore faith in the local government , Franklin shepherded through the city council a new ethics code for municipal employees . She corralled 75 private firms to conduct studies of Atlanta 's budgetary , infrastructure and homeless problems and perform a massive audit of the city government  --  pro bono . She organized a task force she called the Pothole Posse to go after the city 's crumbling streets . She kept a running tally of cracks that were filled , combining good stewardship with quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city manager from 1982 to ' 90 and served several key roles on its 1996 Olympics committee , is not just a rampaging reformer but also a skillful and diplomatic negotiator . Working with county and state officials , she managed to pull together a complex set of loans and agreements that will bring about $3 billion in upgrades and repairs to Atlanta 's leaky sewers . <P> Since 2002 , Franklin has turned in three balanced budgets , and in February she reported an $18 million revenue surplus . A $5 million homeless shelter is scheduled to open this summer . She plans to run for a second term this November , and so far nobody is even bothering to oppose her . For her achievements Franklin was awarded the John F. Kennedy Profile in Courage Award this year by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation . She is the first sitting mayor to be so honored.  --  By Lev Grossman . With reporting by Greg Fulton/Atlanta
