I had a sobering thought recently when I heard that the citizens of Emmen , Switzerland ( pop . 27,000 ) , had been permitted to decide which of the 56 immigrants living among them should be granted citizenship  --  voting in an election that had some characteristics of fraternity rush week . It occurred to me that if the citizens of St. Joseph , Mo. , had been given similar power in 1910 or so , my family would probably have lost in a landslide . <P> Let 's face it : my people were n't even all that popular back where they came from . That 's why they left in the first place . No , my grandparents would never have made the cut , and under the Swiss system of not granting automatic citizenship to native-born descendants of immigrants , I might still be standing in line trying to get my green card renewed . <P> In Emmen , a Lucerne suburb , eligible voters received a booklet that included not only pictures of each prospective citizen but also information on his financial affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forebears scoring any points in the hobby section . My great-uncle Benny did grow tomatoes in his backyard , and I had a great-aunt who liked to spend her spare time nagging . Otherwise , I ca n't remember that crowd having any hobbies , unless you count comical attempts to speak English . <P> In Switzerland the first step of naturalization is handled on the local level , and lately a right-wing party has led an effort to make the decision by popular ballot . The view of political analysts on what the central issue of the immigrants ' election would be was borne out by the Emmen results , which cleared eight of the 56 applicants : if an immigrant is from Italy he has a chance and if he 's from the Balkans he does n't . <P> The first thing an American would think of , of course , is how to finagle this system . Maybe you would move to a part of Switzerland that is soft on Montenegrins . If you had one of those Yugoslav names with a paucity of vowels , you might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boccie playing and fine-tuning your grandma 's lasagna recipe . Or maybe , in order to reassure voters that you 're harmless because culturally you 're already Swiss , you could list your hobbies as eating heavy food , reminding others to be punctual and responding to attempts at humor by frowning and saying , " Is that meant to be funny , or what ? " <P> If Switzerland were more like America , in fact , there would be web-sites to help you design your resume for the booklet given to voters . Sooner or later , advising immigrants would be an off-year fallback for campaign consultants , who would plaster the sides of buses with advertisements like VOTE FOR ZLATKO CVTJAJ  --  NOT AS CROATIAN AS HE LOOKS . <P> I assume all that is against regulations in Switzerland , a country renowned for regulations . It would n't surprise me to hear that in Switzerland you ca n't legally change your name unless you 're a citizen . And you probably have to win naturalization approval in the place your family was originally registered . That would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived there . Whenever an immigrants ' election was scheduled , I 'd show up , still trying to figure out what would make me seem American .
