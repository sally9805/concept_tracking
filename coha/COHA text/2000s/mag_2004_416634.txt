Ignorance : The Response Goes Up The editorial in the January issue , " Ignorance : The Cost Goes Up , " generated more mail than any other in the past two years  --  some supporting the message that the U.S. may pay a high price for scientific ignorance among the population and the politicians ; some complaining of the politicization of POPULAR SCIENCE ; and some arguing that our examples , such as global warming and stem cell research , are off-target . Below , a sample The editorial can be found at popsci.com I am a chemistry instructor in the public schools . This is the most valid commentary I have read in ages . Americans foolishly fail to recognize that technological dependence will inevitably direct an educationally lazy society to failure . R.H. Burnett Philadelphia , Pa I am the child of scientists . I grew up being part of scientific discussions around the dinner table and rational debates on just about any topic imaginable All that early preparation has led me to agree that science and technology are too often confused in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you feel that people who do not agree with your conclusions on such issues as the Kyoto Protocol or embryonic stem cell research must be ignorant . Debate is the heart and soul of science ; calling people names when they disagree with you does great harm . Penelope Biskey Springfield , Va Children spend their formative years learning the importance of the remote control , not the importance of learning . How can public education be blamed when parents have not stimulated the minds of their children with anything other than Bob the Builder or Teletubbies ? Bryan J. Mahan Whitehall , Mich As the director of an aerospace-technician training program , I see firsthand , every day , the symptoms you outlined . Unless our country finds a way to interest more young people in the theories and practices of science and technology , we are doomed to drift back to much lower levels of achievement and prosperity . Al Koller Titusville , Fla I think your editorial should be reprinted in a few dozen teeny-bopper magazines , but it still probably would n't get noticed unless it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Md That half the people asked did n't know it takes a year for the Earth to travel around the Sun really did not surprise me . What did surprise me is that you blamed public education for this . You are public educators . But most of your magazine seems to be sound bites of information geared to selling products  --  not a lot of depth or scientific information . Dale Hanson Everett , Wash I do n't understand the apparent push to politicize science and technology matters in this publication . Your cover mixing images about science news with those of our president ( conveniently tagged " Winners &; Losers " ) shows a lack of discipline . If you corrupt this magazine , you will lose subscribers . Michael A. Thornton Florence , Ky Chemical Reaction In Theodore Gray 's article on electrolysis " The Subatomic Assembly of H2 , " POPULAR SCIENCE Adventure , Dec. ' 03 , he mentioned adding salt to the solution in order to increase the current flow . Assuming the salt to be NaCl , it is my understanding that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This would mean : ( electricity ) + 2NaCl + 2H2O  --  &gt; H2 + 2NaOH + Cl2 . This is a balanced equation as far as I know , and seems to yield no O2 gas . Thomas McClish Schoolcraft , Mich Theodore Gray responds : Mr. McClish is correct that this reaction occurs , and that it yields no oxygen . But it occurs only to a small extent compared to the simple electrolysis of water into H2 and O2 , which dominates the process . The chlorine being produced gives the experiment a lovely swimming pool smell , but the bulk of the output is oxygen , as evidenced by the fact that it is clear , not chlorine yellow CORRECTIONS The comparison of the air scoops on the 118 WallyPower " What in the World Is Wally ? " Jan. with the articulating airboxes of the Lamborghini Diablo should have referred to the Lamborghini Murcilago In the illustration of the Bugatti Veyron engine " Hypercar , " Jan. , the exhaust manifold was mislabeled as the intake manifold and vice versa The item shown in Box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an annelid , not a nematode FROM THE BLOGS Last month , over 250 Web logs linked to popsci.com . A sample : GlobalFlyer An article about aviation ber-nut Steve Fossett , and his latest endeavor . He 's going to try to fly this plane , GlobalFlyer , around the world , apparently not satisfied with breaking the balloon record . This is a good read but still does n't beat my favorite recent article , the one in which Eric Adams gets shot with the pain laser . I 'm jealous . I want to get shot by that thing . posted by Nate Suver , Homer vs .
