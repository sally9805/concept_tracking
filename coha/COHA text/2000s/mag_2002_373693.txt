Is the U.S. Ready for War ? <P> An attack on Iraq would only validate Osama bin Laden 's dangerous extremism and further destabilize the Middle East . HAROON MOGHUL Somers , Conn . <P> Your article on how President Bush is making his case for an attack on Iraq Special Report , Sept. 16 highlighted a central danger : " If the last Gulf War helped inspire evil in Osama bin Laden , will a new one create many more like him ? " Saddam Hussein is no more dangerous now than he was before Sept. 11 , 2001 . Even a successful effort to change the regime in Iraq would not reduce the number of radical extremists who want to see a weakened America . Though the world surely would be a better place without a madman like Saddam , let 's set an example for our global neighbors : diplomacy , education and tolerance are the answer ; violence is not . SETH ASHLEY Columbia , Mo . <P> How many more Sept. 11s must we endure before we finally take the fight to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the world ? If ever there was justification for the use of power , the fight to end terrorism is it . JEFFREY BASFORD Poway , Calif . <P> We had damned well better be ready for war , because we 've been at war since September 2001 . This war is different from any we have fought before , and the politically correct will never like it . It has overt and covert operations , some of which will be pre-emptive . Soldiers will die , some by enemy fire and some by friendly fire . Innocent civilians will be killed . This war will be long , and we had better keep the resolve that we will need to see it through . It 's not nice , but it is necessary . DAVID C. MORTENSEN Pocatello , Idaho <P> President Bush 's plan to attack Iraq is a shrewd political maneuver designed to change the target of the war on terrorism from the cunning , elusive and charismatic bin Laden to the oppressive , lackluster and immobile Saddam . This new focus provides a cover for our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Olympia , Wash . <P> If the U.S. can assault a nation based on the speculation that it might one day acquire weapons of mass destruction , why should n't India open fire on Pakistan , which has nuclear weapons today ? Starting a war with Iraq is simple . The consequences are not . JOHN NUNES Milton , Mass . <P> As a combat veteran , I believe that if we do not go after Saddam , we will one day face a weapon of mass destruction from Iraq in our homeland . We need to take the initiative , with or without international support . I was in Hiroshima in 1950 , and there the horror was visible five years after the bombing . We do n't ever want to see that in this country . It would make the destruction of the World Trade Center look like a church picnic . ANDY EMERY San Marcos , Calif . <P> The World Nervously Watches <P> After Sept. 11 , America had moral authority and international support as well as military might . If it acts against Iraq without U.N @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would undermine not just itself but also the central pillar of world order since the last world war . It would polarize the globe into Arab vs. non-Arab while rendering impotent the only organization that might prevent a division that would provide the basis for the next , and final , global conflict .
