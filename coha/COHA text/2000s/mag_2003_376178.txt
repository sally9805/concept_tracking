Wallace Stevens was n't just one of the greatest poets of the 20th century , he was also an insurance executive . When he died , Stevens was vice president of the Hartford Accident and Indemnity Co . So where , one might reasonably ask , are his odes to the expense account ? His sonnets on the ecstasies of business-class travel ? The sad fact is , the inner life of the great American middle manager is woefully underchronicled . <P> Here to remedy that is Stanley Bing , whose roundly entertaining and surprisingly touching novel , You Look Nice Today ( Bloomsbury ; 291 pages ) , is set almost entirely in the carpeted corridors of a large , faceless multinational conglomerate . Bing ( the name is a pseudonym ) writes a column for FORTUNE magazine ( published by Time Inc. , as is TIME ) , but he also has a day job as an executive at a major corporation . Thus he knows whereof he writes . <P> The hero of You Look Nice Today is Robert Harbert , " Harb " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process and procedure at the Global Fiduciary Trust Co. , and he 's a relatively generic specimen of the common suit : 44 , nice guy , weak chin , happily married . Harb 's troubles begin when he hires an attractive assistant named CaroleAnne . Over the next few years , it emerges that CaroleAnne , while quite good at her job , is in fact a nutcase . Even though Harb heaps raises and promotions on her , she becomes increasingly paranoid and hostile , and finally she quits and sues Global for $150 million , claiming that she has been sexually harassed . The suit sends Harb 's career at Global straight downward . <P> There you have the plot of You Look Nice Today , and it 's the least interesting thing about it . Bing could have gone for a balanced , ambiguous , what-is-justice-really kind of tale , but he did n't . He made Harb a good guy and CaroleAnne an unsympathetic harpy  --  and anyway , sexual harassment does n't have the crackle that it had back in the days of , say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's novel lies in his masterful , merciless evocation of the executive milieu  --  the lunches , the banter , the petty slights , the Scotch-soaked male bonding . " Keep in mind , please , that large emotions and reactions are alien to a true corporate workplace environment , " Bing urges us . " A great business milieu is like creme brulee , with the tasty custard down below and a fine glazed topping up above , sweet and hard , that obscures what is beneath . " <P> Bing is adept at sketching that surface , but he 's not afraid to plunge his spoon into those creamy depths . What happens when a company man like Harb is yanked out of his cozy corporate cubby and thrown back on resources of introspection he has n't used for decades ? " He had been a man with a job , a huge title and many , many things to do , " Bing writes . " Now it was full daylight on a weekday , and he had no tie on . " You Look Nice Today is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a portrait of corporate life , you 'd have to go back to Sloan Wilson 's The Man in the Grey Flannel Suit to find its equal . Rather than another searing indictment , Bing gives us a cockeyed love letter to the executive suite , and he reminds us that while we may hate that gray flannel suit , we can get very cold at night without it .  --  By Lev Grossman
