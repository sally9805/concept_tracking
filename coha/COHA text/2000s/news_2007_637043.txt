<p> Lake Buena Vista , Fla.  --  Chipper Jones talked his way into the lineup Tuesday , one day after giving the Braves a scare when he limped off the field with a sprained left ankle . <p> " I feel fine , " he said at batting practice before the night game against Houston at Disney 's Wide World of Sports . " I was n't in the original lineup . But I said , ' Please , pretty please . ' " <p> Manager Bobby Cox did n't have to be persuaded too much since the sprain was only minor and did n't swell overnight . It was n't a high ankle sprain like the one that put Jones on the disabled list in April 2006 , when he slipped on a wet field in San Francisco and injured his right ankle and knee . <p> " He came in and said , ' I want to play , ' " Cox said . " So we had to switch it around a little . I did n't have him in there . " <p> Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up lame out of the batter 's box on a first-inning grounder Monday vs . St. Louis . When Jones limped back to the dugout , Cox decided to get him out of the game and into the training room . <p> Jones said he knew Monday the sprain was n't severe . <p> " I 'm going to have to tape it tonight , but I 've got to get at-bats , " he said before Tuesday 's game , the first night game of the spring for the Braves . <p> He had just four hits in 18 at-bats ( .222 ) before Tuesday , with four walks and a strikeout . Jones said he 's felt " terrible " at the plate . <p> HUDSON REBOUNDS FROM ROCKY START <p> It was a situation that frequently spiraled out of control for Tim Hudson in 2006 . But Tuesday night , there was an encouraging sign for the Braves pitcher . <p> After giving up four hits  --  three for extra bases  --  and two runs in the first two innings , Hudson allowed only a single over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Chipper Jones ' two-out single in the seventh provided a 3-2 Braves lead , but minor leaguer Manny Acosta allowed eight of nine Houston runs in the ninth , when he faced eight batters and failed to record an out ( two walks followed by six consecutive hits ) . <p> The Braves wo n't be counting on Acosta this season , but they need big things from Hudson . <p> " After the first couple of innings , I was able to make some adjustments with my arm and felt a lot better , " said Hudson , who has a 2.70 ERA in three starts . <p> " It 's nice to be able to go out there and make an adjustment mid-game or mid-inning . Last year , it just snowballed on me . The bleeding did n't stop . " <p> Jones and Jeff Francoeur had two hits apiece , and Matt Diaz added a two-run single for the Braves . <p> Rafael Soriano had two strikeouts in a perfect inning , and Macay McBride had three strikeouts in 1 1/3 innings . Reliever Chad Paronto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a grounder in the seventh . <p> The crowd of 11,230 was the sixth-largest in 11 years of Braves spring training at Disney World . <p> TONY PENA FACES UNCERTAINTY <p> He 's not the most highly regarded of the Braves ' bevy of middle-infield prospects , but Tony Pena Jr . is the only one out of minor league options . <p> That means he ca n't be sent to the minors without going through waivers . So there 's a chance he could soon be playing for another organization , whether he 's traded or claimed off waivers . <p> " It 's something I ca n't control , " said Pena , who hit .261 with a triple in 23 at-bats before Tuesday . " I just need to go out and do what I can do here . " <p> He said he was n't aware of his options situation until recently . He 's played in the Braves organization since 2000 and has been on the 40-man roster since 2004 . One option is used each season that a player is on the 40-man " protected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You ca n't play better than Tony 's played this spring , " Cox said . " His defense is major-league caliber . Excellent range , excellent throws , great hands . He can play all three positions shortstop , second and third base with ease . " <p> It 's possible Pena could make the Braves ' opening-day roster if utility men Chris Woodward or Willy Aybar are n't ready . But even then , the Braves could opt for incumbent Pete Orr or prospect Martin Prado , who 's having a great spring . <p> COX : STILL TIME FOR WOODWARD <p> Woodward still has n't played a game for his new team because of a strained right calf , but Cox said there 's enough time to get him ready for opening day . <p> He could get plenty of at-bats in minor league games that begin this weekend . <p> Woodward and Aybar ( right hand/wrist ) took infield and batting practice Tuesday and could be in the lineup this week . <p> " I feel like I can play right now , " said Woodward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ League opener . " It 's been too long sitting out . They just do n't want to push it too much and risk reinjuring it at this point . " <p> Aybar missed a week with visa problems , then went 4-for-9 with a homer in three games before soreness returned in the hand he injured during winter ball . <p> MORE CUTS MADE <p> Reliever Joey Devine was optioned to Class AAA Richmond , and top pitching prospect Matt Harrison was reassigned to minor league camp along with right-hander Kevin Barry and former University of Georgia catcher Clint Sammons . <p> Devine allowed one hit and one run with three strikeouts in three innings over two spring appearances , but he also hit two batters and walked one . The Braves want him to continue developing his control and rebuilding his confidence . Harrison , a 21-year-old left-hander , allowed seven hits and six runs in three innings , including two homers . He 's made only 12 starts above Class A. The Braves trimmed the camp roster by 10 with two rounds of cuts in two days . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Astros <p> * When : 1:05 p.m. today <p> * Pitchers : LH Chuck James , Braves vs .
