The Conqueror By Judith E. French Dorchester Publishing Judith E. French As the only living child of Prince Oxyartes and Queen Pari , Roxanne been the hope of her people . Together with the man she took to husband , she was meant to rule the twin kingdoms of Bactria and Sogdiana . She was no dainty Persian princess , hidden away in palace splendor . Descended from that race of fair-skinned warrior women the Greeks called Amazons , she 'd been trained in the bow and short sword before she was old enough to read . By ten , she 'd spent a month alone in the mountains guarding the horse herds , and at fourteen she had slain her first snow tiger with three shafts from a horn bow . The twin mountain kingdoms , wealthy beyond belief and home to her family for more than a thousand years , had been her world . Her lineage was without blemish . Roxanne smiled at a half-forgotten memory . Had not Darius the Third , King of Kings , mighty bull of Persia , sent his ambassadors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had stood beside her father in the East Tower of the Blue Palace and watched the disappointed emissaries ride away . " What need has Roxanne of a Persian throne ? " her father had asked . " Or the sheltered life of veil and purdah ? But I can forbid you nothing , child of my heart . Say the word , and I 'll send riders to fetch them back . " She 'd answered with abarracks-yard oath , and her father had bellowed with laughter and enveloped her in a bear hug . How solid he 'd seemed , how proud she 'd been of him-a prince with the pride and the power to refuse King Darius . When she thought back , that shining moment-solid as the rock beneath her feet- had marked the end of a life she had believed would last forever . A week later , her father and her cousin Kayan had answered the call to arms , leading an army of fierce cavalrymen to aid the Persians against the Macedonian barbarians her people called Greeks . But the invaders had sliced through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her people had fought bravely , but the Greeks were too many , and they could not stand alone once the remaining Persian troops had fled . The women of her house had always been educated to rule . She had studied medicine , mathematics , and astronomy since she was old enough to toddle . She could read and write five languages and speak seven . And on that day , she 'd set herself to study Greek . She had always believed that her husband would be her beloved Kayan . Astrologers had chosen him on the day she was born . Son of her father 's cousin , he was both noble and wealthy in his own right . But wealth had never interested Kayan . From boyhood on , he had been a warrior . He 'd risen to the rank of commander , an honor for one so young . War with the Greeks went on . Brave Bactria fell . Sogdiana struggled for her life . Cities burned . Vultures preyed on the unburied dead . Each mile Alexander of Macedonia gained had to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was mired in Greek blood . Roxanne , hiding her womanhood with the felt and fur clothing of a Sogdian warrior , stood beside Oxyartes to receive the Greek heralds " Tell your master , this Alexander of Macedonia , " Oxyartes bellowed , " that we will never surrender . If he wants to take this rock he must find flying soldiers ! " Kayan scowled at the departing delegation . " What now ? " " Now we wait , " Oxyartes said . " There are easier lands to conquer . My spies tell me that his soldiers long to follow the caravan route to India . Let them . Here we are and here we stay . " He laid a hand on Roxanne 's shoulder . " Go to the women 's quarters , daughter . " " My place is here beside you . You 'd not send a prince to cower among the crones and suckling babes . " Her father 's powerful grip tightened as his temper flared . " A prince would know his duty to his liege , no matter what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will have no hysterical women throwing themselves from tower windows when you can calm them . " Flushed with shame , Roxanne bowed her head in wordless apology . If only she 'd been born a prince , Alexander would never have come so far . " Let me be of some real use , " she begged . " I know all the ways off this mountain . In Greek clothing , I could sneak into Alexander 's camp and put an arrow- " " No ! " Kayan said . " You must- " Her father silenced him with a stern look . " Slaying Alexander will not turn back this army , child , " he said . " No man could be prouder of a son than I am of you . But you are a woman , not a man . You are made to bring life , not take it . " Swallowing the retort that sprang to her lips , Roxanne placed a fist over her heart in the soldier 's gesture of obedience and hurried toward the gate that protected the women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and called for the warden within to unbolt the door for the princess royal . As Roxanne stepped forward , she heard Kayan 's call . One final kiss , and then Roxanne went to soothe the women and children . " My father bids you all to pray for our deliverance . " " What if the cliff face does not hold them ? " Mitra demanded in her grating voice . " What then ? " She clutched her remaining son , a red-faced babe , to her ample breast . She had right to fear . Her husband and thirteen-year-old son had fallen at the River Oxys . " Then we must be prepared to die as Bactrians and Sogdians . " " No more talk of death , " Soraya called . " It is time to feed the children . " She laid a warm palm on Roxanne 's cheek . * * * Dawn broke late over the mountains . Rose pink rays of light spilled through the thick clouds that enveloped the peaks rising over the citadel . Roxanne shivered , despite her wolf-skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of summer , and the nights were frigid . A sentry shouted an alarm . Armed men spilled from the barracks , some stringing bows , others tugging on boots and coats . " There ! " one cried . Up above them , high over the citadel , enemy soldiers clustered on the rock face . " Sorcery , " her father swore . " It is n't possible . " Macedonian heralds under a white flag of truce were already riding up the narrow rock trail . The arrogant messenger thrust forth his missive . " Alexander promises the lives of our women if we surrender , " her father said . " Look above . There must be three hundred archers . " His proud shoulders sagged . " It is over . Kayan ! Take my daughter to the women 's quarters . See that she is dressed as befits her station . " " No ! " Roxanne caught her father 's arm . His face was tallow-white , suddenly old . " Do n't ask this of me . I would stay with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you love me , grant me this ! " " For that love , I can not . Take her , Kayan , by force if you must . Take also a hundred of the palace guard to protect the women until we see if Alexander be true or false . " Kayan 's obsidian eyes narrowed . " And if the Greeks betray us ? " " Then I trust you will find the strength to do what must be done . " ( Continues ... ) by Judith E. French
