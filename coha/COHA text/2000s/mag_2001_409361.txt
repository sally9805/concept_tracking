Section : Home Computing Furniture A well-designed workstation can prevent injuries and make you more productive . <p> You do n't have to be in your office , hunched over a keyboard day in , day out , to wind up with a computer-related ailment . Even if you 're surfing the web in your family room , you can strain your neck , shoulders , wrists , and more if you 're improperly positioned . Whether at work or at home , you 'll be more comfortable and minimize the risk of injury by using well-designed furniture . <p> If you 're willing to do a little legwork , you can combine a regular desk or table with a few accessories to create a nicely equipped , ergonomically correct workstation that costs just a couple of hundred dollars ( or less ) , as we explain a bit later . But it 's often more convenient and just as economical to buy furniture designed specifically for computer use . You may find such furniture more attractive than unrelated components you round up on your own , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rack or corkboard , that are sometimes included . <p> Computer furniture comes in a range of styles , from contemporary to country and mission . The most popular choice is a desk with a hutch , a cupboardlike attachment that sits atop the desk and provides extra storage space . Other choices include large corner and L-shaped units , many with a hutch ; small , mobile carts with casters ; and armoires that conceal your computer gear behind closed doors . <p> Prices are as varied as the selection . Preassembled workstations made of finely finished solid wood cost several thousand dollars at the high end . Furniture you put together yourself-often called ready-to-assemble ( RTA ) or sometimes flat-packed-costs much less . Most RTA workstations are made of laminated particleboard and sell for $100 to $300 or so . Those made with wood and wood veneer can be considerably more expensive . <p> Since most consumers gravitate toward the low end , we focused on that segment , testing 30 RTA pieces priced from $65 to $400 . Our goal was to evaluate usability , fit , finish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> The most important consideration when setting up a computer workstation is ergonomics , or how well it fits the person using it . If furniture is well designed , it reduces stress on your body . " Position Is Everything " at right , offers guidelines you should follow for optimal ergonomics . <p> While many of the RTA workstations we tested were serviceable , we did n't consider any to be top-notch in ergonomics . The main reason was the lack of an adjustable keyboard shelf that can be raised or lowered to suit the user . Largely because of that , we did n't give an ergonomics score higher than Good to any of the models we tested . ( The one unit with an adjustable shelf had other problems that lowered its score . ) <p> Shelf height was n't the only issue . On some of the units we tested , the keyboard shelf was too small to hold both the keyboard and the mouse . If the mouse has to sit on the desktop , you have to reach up and over to maneuver it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Monitor position was another concern . Some units had a monitor shelf set too high , forcing you to tilt your head back ; on others , the shelf was too far from the user . On a few models , the monitor was too close because the desktop was too shallow or a hutch 's back wall got in the way . <p> That 's not to say the tested models wo n't meet your needs . For instance , if a fixed-height keyboard shelf happens to be at the right height for you , the lack of adjustability might not be an issue . If the keyboard position is n't comfortable , or if several users will be sharing a workstation , you can replace the existing shelf with an adjustable one . Such shelves start at less than $100 . <p> A height-adjustable chair and a footrest can solve the problem of a too-high keyboard shelf by putting you , and other users , in the correct position . A good chair is an integral part of an ergonomically correct workstation . Ideally , the chair should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Chairs come in different sizes , so be sure to try out various models to see what feels most comfortable . On some chairs , you can adjust not only the arms and the seating height , but also the height and angle of the seatback to accommodate an individual 's needs . Experiment with these and other adjustments to get the best fit . <p> If you 're the do-it-yourself type , you can build an ergonomically sound workstation by combining a large , plain table or desk with an adjustable keyboard shelf and , if needed , a stand that raises the monitor to the correct height . A simple desk or table can run $100 or less ; you may be able to use one you already own . Adding a keyboard shelf ( $100 or less ) , a monitor stand ( $20 to $40 ) , and a basic file cabinet ( $30 to $50 ) would put the tab at just a few hundred dollars at most . Keep in mind that the result may not be a perfect match stylistically . <p> FIT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ covered with a laminate , which usually has a photographic image of wood grain . Some models or similar units may be available in different wood-look laminates ; they 're listed in Recommendations &; Notes on page 24 . Units that are finished on the back , as well as the front , allow more flexibility in placement since you do n't have to hide the back against a wall . <p> In some cases , you 'll see a white line where the laminate does n't quite meet on adjacent edges . A touch-up pen , included with some furniture , is handy for filling in these edges or surface scratches . Other flaws to watch out for include a splotchy or uneven finish or uncovered drilled holes . Some finishes can be damaged by beverages such as coffee and cola , so wipe up spills promptly . <p> If you prefer the look of real wood to a laminate 's faux finish , you can find relatively low-priced RTA furniture made of solid wood or veneer ( a thin slice of real wood glued to particleboard or plywood ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tests , the only units to score Excellent for finish were made of wood veneer : the Ikea Anton 47 " Desk , $340 , and the Bush Westwood WC2806A cart , $180 . Each was the highest-priced of the products that we tested in its category . <p> You can find some higher-end furniture at specialty retailers such as Levenger ( www.levenger.com ) and Crate &; Barrel ( retail stores or www.crateandbarrel.com ) . Both have solid-wood or veneer desks with keyboard trays that sell for about $300 to $500 . Martin Furniture , which we saw online at www.officefurniture.com , has a variety of solid-wood and veneer computer desks with oak and cherry finishes , priced at about $500 and up . ( Because this report focused on lower-end furniture , we did n't test such higher-priced pieces . ) <p> Finish is only half the story when it comes to appearance . Problems arise when pieces do n't fit tightly or line up correctly . Generally , the major panels of the tested models fit well , but we did see problems with some shelves and doors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers-gave the tightest fit . We found Sauder 's proprietary Twist-Locks harder to align , which may cause gaps . <p> Most of the furniture we tested was rated Good or better for both fit and finish . The only exceptions were the Creative Interiors desk and corner unit and the Dorel desk ; the samples we tested had many defects . <p> DO IT YOURSELF <p> Overall , the assembly of our test units went fairly smoothly . Most earned a score of Good or better for assembly . It took our engineer , admittedly a veteran at assembling RTA furniture , from a half-hour to more than four hours to put together each of the tested models . A novice with average mechanical aptitude might take twice as long . The Sauder Monarch armoire was n't difficult to assemble , but with 54 panels , 184 screws , 52 fasteners , and 60 nails , it took the most time to complete . <p> The need to piece together a jigsaw puzzle of parts underscores the importance of clear directions . More than half the tested models had excellent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the best . But other directions were unclear , incomplete , or incorrect . Ikea 's , for example , had little or no written text-just crude diagrams that were difficult to interpret , especially since the components were not labeled . Ikea is also one of the few manufacturers that do not have a toll-free help line . Some vendors , including Bush and Sauder , have online help features such as a screwdriver , an Allen-head wrench ( included with the unit when necessary ) , and possibly a partner to help lift or position components . Some manufacturers warn that you can strip out a screw hole if you use a power screwdriver or drill . We used a cordless drill with an adjustable clutch and had no problems . If you 're handy with such a tool , you should n't have difficulty either . Otherwise , we would n't advise experimenting with a project like this . <p> Some tips to help you through setup : Before you begin , lay out and inspect all the parts to see if anything is missing or damaged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then be prepared to wait a week to 10 days to receive it . And set the unit up in the location where it will be used-it may be very hard to move once assembled . <p> If you lack the mechanical aptitude or time to handle assembly , you can hire a pro to do it for you . The retailer may offer setup service or refer you to a company that will do the job . Depending on the size and complexity of a piece , assembly may cost $35 to $100 or so . To obtain a price quote , you generally need a specific item number , which you can find on your receipt , on the carton , on the store display , or on the vendor 's or retailer 's web site . <p> RECOMMENDATIONS <p> Your top priority should be to get a unit that 's ergonomically sound . You also need to consider how much room you have and how much work space you need . Measure your monitor , CPU , and printer to make sure the furniture can hold them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would have to go on the floor or desktop . All tested models will house a 17-inch cathode-ray tube ( CRT ) monitor , but some are a tight fit for a 19-inch display . <p> Desk with hutch . Many consumers find that a computer desk provides adequate room to work without hogging floor space . Any but the three lowest-rated models would be a reasonable choice . The Sauder Bayshore 4163-267 , a well-made unit , is a relative bargain at $170 . Less costly , but with less work space : the Ridgewood/Charles- wood 57553 , $90 , A CR Best Buy . ( It 's discontinued , but similar models are available . ) <p> Corner or L-shaped unit . If you have ample floor space and crave elbowroom , a spacious corner or L-shaped unit could be just right . Keep in mind that their size and shape can make these units difficult to move once assembled . The Intelligent Designs 10342 , $400 , offered the best combination of functionality , fit , and finish . Another fine choice : the Ridgewood/Charleswood 14032 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best Buy . <p> Cart . you may want a cart if space or money is tight or if you want to move your computer around . But you 'll have to put up with limited work space and mediocre ergonomics-be prepared to hit your shins or your feet on the lower shelves . If you can live with those trade-offs , the well-made , wood-veneer Bush Westwood WC2806A , $180 , is a good choice , but you 'll pay a premium for the veneer finish . Three lower-priced carts - the Sauder Cornerstone 7399-105 , $110 , the Sauder 2799 , $110 , and the O'Sullivan 61925 , $100-also merit consideration . <p> Armoire . If you want to hide the computer when it 's not being used , consider an armoire . The Sauder Monarch 2749 , $400 , is a large , feature-laden model with ample work and storage space . But it 's quite a project to assemble . Enlist an assistant and plan on spending up to a day to put it together . <p> As mentioned earlier , you may be able to improve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an adjustable shelf . But if you ca n't find a computer workstation that fills the bill , follow the guidelines we offered earlier to pull together a do-it-yourself workstation . The monitor should be about an arm 's length away , at a height that puts the top line of text at or just below eye level . If you 'll be consulting paperwork , use a copyholder to position it at the same height as the screen . The workstation should provide ample room for your legs and feet . Your feet should be flat on the floor ( or on a footrest ) , with your thighs parallel to the floor . <p> POSITION IS EVERYTHING A workstation should put you in a comfortable and safe working position . Here are some key points to consider when choosing computer furniture . <p> The keyboard and monitor should be placed directly in front of you-not at an angle-so that you do n't have to twist or turn either your head or your body . <p> The keyboard shelf should be large enough to hold both the keyboard and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders relaxed and your wrists straight and flat . <p> The chair should be adjustable for height and have padded , adjustable arms and a stable , wheeled base . <p> The monitor should be about an arm 's length away , at a height that puts the top line of text at or just below eye level . If you 'll be consulting paperwork , use a copyholder to position it at the same height as the screen . <p> The workstation should provide ample room for your legs and feet . Your feet should be flat on the floor ( or on a footrest ) , with your thighs parallel to the floor . <p> Shing Banging Some furniture ( notably carts ) leaves too little room for your legs and feet . Try to avoid units that are likely to cramp you as shown here . <p> <p> Our top-rated desk , the Sauder Bayshore 4163-267 , $170 <p> <p> A good choice : the Bush Westwood WC2806A , $180 <p> <p> The Sauder Monarch 2749 , $400 , earned a rating of Good . <p> <p> PHOTO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Intelligent Designs 10342 , $400 <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p>
