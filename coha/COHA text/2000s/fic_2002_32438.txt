When Ruth arrived on the truck loaded with her supplies , she headed straight for the first of four pinyons that enclosed her cabin site . While Matt guided John Olsen 's backing of the flatbed , she boosted herself up the trunk of the pine and inched her way out onto a wide lower limb , until she could wrap her hand around a rusted tin can hanging from the branch above . Ruth had been picturing that moment since the day she signed the form and paid the fees for her homestead , March 15 , 1929 , nearly three weeks before . At that moment , she had made up her mind to erase all sign of the place 's history as a stopover for cowboys who could n't tolerate a few drops of pine pitch on their shirts . Can-Tree Springs , indeed : not a fit name for her land . Ruth yanked on the can , but it remained stubborn . After twisting the tin several times to loosen the baling wire , she jerked down again . Both wire and can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the three other cans , Ruth patted the rough bark beside her . She would free the other trees once the men left . With a finger she caught one of the clear drips of pitch that covered the sides of the cantrying the turpentine taste on her tongue . The rest of the sticky drip she smeared on the back of a hand , its scent merging with her own , then she dropped to the ground to help the men unload her belongings . Matt and John had already begun piling building materials in front of the furthest pinyon , beside an odd-shaped boulder that reached to just above Ruth 's waist . " Wait , " she called out to Matt , who was ready to throw moreplanks onto the pile . " Not there . Do n't put any more there . How about over by that scrub oak ? " " What 's the matter with here ? " Matt leaned the planks against the boulder and swiped his forehead with the back of a hand . Sunlight turned his hair the color of fresh-churned butter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " His pale blue eyes settled on her as John Olsen came up beside him lugging a huge sack of cement . " I 'd just have to move it all again " she said . " That 's why . " Ruth picked up a fallen twig . " Look . I 'll show you , " she said , pacing out the area as she drew an approximate rectangle in the dirt . " Here 's where my cabin will be , between the pinyons , where the ground 's nice and flat . You can see you 're putting all that inside my cabin . " " If you draw your rectangle the other way , we wo n't be , " Matt said . " Just turn your house around . " With one foot he began to redraw the floor plan . " No , " Ruth said . " I want to walk right out into morning sun . My front door has to face east . " " Ya , Rute , " John Olsen said , hunkering beside the stone . He rubbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you do about the boulder ? " Ruth walked over and squatted beside the old Swede , who smelled of goat and infrequent baths . Baths would not come easy here in this canyon , she realized . She ran a palm across the cold exterior of the rock . It appeared strangely alive . The smooth saddle of its back , the way it rested on a rounded belly made it seem like some kind of mineral beast . " I guess I 'll have to move it , then " she said . Both men laughed . Matt patted her shoulder . " Ruth , " he said , " you may be the most capable woman I ever met . Honest . But not even John and I together could move that boulder . " Ruth felt her face flush . For once Matt 's big smile did n't turn her to goo . " Just put the building materials over there , Matt Baxter , " she said . " I 'll move this rock . You wait and see . " She marched toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Olsen rose and began shifting the pile . With three of them , it did n't take long to finish the unloading . While Matt and John set up her tent and carried in her cot and chest of drawers , Ruth gathered wood and built a fire in the circle of rocks that cowboys in the past had constructed . Then she picked up a bucket and walked across the wash to the patch of green that surrounded her spring . She knelt among the wiry sprigs of succulent grass , some more than a foot high , and dunked her bucket into the shallow pool of watercareful to avoid skater bugs and the gray beetle floating upside down near the water 's edge . Behind the spring , the exposed roots of a cottonwood dropped a tangled skirt down the bank . When her bucket was full , she dipped a cupped hand into the water and brought it to her mouth . No water had ever tasted so sweet . Her very own , fresh from the earth . Her earth . Later , the three of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ homestead with cups of cowboy coffee . Containing her eagerness for the men to leave , Ruth sat savoring the smell of coffee and campfire smoke . She listened to the drone of passing flies and admired the sunlight puddling on Matt 's soft curls . Caught up as she was in details close to her , she almost did n't notice , just over Matt 's head , a man descending the bluff across the wash , dropping so smoothly he appeared almost to float down the rocks . She was too surprised to say a word , but her face spoke for her : John Olsen followed her eyes over to the stony base of Rocky Mountain . " It just Jim , Rute . Indian Jim , " John said , pulling pipe makings from his pocket . " But I thought you and Kate were my nearest neighbors , " Ruth said , " What is he doing ... " " Ya , Rute . Jim stay on the mountain sometime . In summer . He set svedges at the mine . Good worker , Jim is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pipe . Ruth got up and walked to the campfire , where she wrestled the enamel pot off to the side of the rocks . Using a stick to tip the hot pot handle , Ruth poured coffee into her cup while the man made his way toward the camp . She wondered what she would have done if Matt and John had n't been there . What could she have done ? She decided to take up Matt 's offer and borrow his rifle until the one she had ordered came in at Matt 's General Store . Not that she 'd ever shot a rifle . The man was dark-skinned , with definitive , rugged features . Abundant black hair hung loose halfway to his waist , except where it was bound by a red bandana around his forehead . Ruth had seen Indians before in El Paso , Mexican Indians who came across the border for supplies or business . She had never spoken to one , but had always been curious because of the rumors about her mother , Cally . No one in the family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overheard enough hushed snatches of stories those years she lived with her aunt , whispers about the " half-breed bastard " her grandfather had brought home to raise . And once when Ruth was very young , she remembered a time on the streets in El Paso when a well-dressed woman spat at her mother 's feet and hissed the word squaw . Matt nodded when John Olsen made the introductions , did not rise or offer his hand . Ruth was surprised to see suspicion and discomfort in his face . She could tell the Indian noticed it too : not that the expression on Jim 's face did more than harden around the eyes as he looked at Matt . She made a point of walking over to offer her hand , though Matt 's disapproval lent stiffness to her action . " There 's hot coffee , " she said , resuming her seat . " The cups are in the box there . Feel free . " " Thanks , " Jim said , his face softening into the suggestion of a smile . " I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Have they told you , " Jim said as he tipped the coffeepot to pour , " about the inscripted rocks up there on the mountain ? " " Inscripted rocks ? " Ruth asked , confused as much by the Indian 's manner and clear speech as by what he said . He was more than simply smart . " What kind of inscriptions ? " A picture formed in her head of cowboys attacking the rocks with pen and ink . " Figures people long ago made on rocks . Your people call them petroglyphs . I 'll show them to you sometime if you want . It means this place was important once . Possibly a major hunting area . My own people had a strange name for it . Something like place where rocks reside . Something like that but not quite . Maybe more like small rocks rising . Some things just do n't translate , " he said . From her two years at Sarah Higgins Academy , Ruth recognized the educated nature of his speechcurious in such a man . But underlying that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over words , blunting the sharp edges of sound the way flowing water rounds off sharp rocks . She looked at Matt , who was studying the man with a wary interest . " So before the cowboys came here with their tin cans , there were Indians , " Ruth said . " That 's true everywhere , is n't it ? " Jim sat on a small flat rock next to the fire . " Good coffee , " he said , swirling the liquid in his cup so that light from its surface scattered patterns on the pinyon branches overhead . " You come down to house , Jim ? Could use help . " Olsen tapped out finished tobacco onto the ground and rubbed it into the dirt with one foot . " Go up for a load in the morning . Stay tree or four day . " He returned the pipe to his shirt pocket . " Thought I might . I 'll catch a ride down with you , John . Spotted your truck from near the top . " " Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Matt said , his eyes on the Indian . " Come on . I 'll instruct you . " He got up and walked to her chair , reached out a hand . Ruth allowed him her hand and followed him back to the truck . Matt seemed distracted as he gave her a lesson on loading the .22 . When he showed her where the safety was located , he seemed unaware of how close his arm came to her breast . " I want to make sure you 're safe , " he told her , once the rifle was loaded . " I 'll be back in a week . No telling who might wander by meanwhile . Here , " he said , " I 'll show you how to shoot it . " Picking up one of the cans Ruth had discarded from the pine , Matt placed it on top of a rock near the bank of the wash . As she aimed the rifle , he came up behind and reached both arms around her , snuggling the rifle into the crotch of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Line up those two sights on that can , " he said , leaning in closer . She could barely breathe with the warm outline of his body fitted tight against her . Ruth felt him suck in his breath . She closed one eye and lined up the sights so the can sat square in front of the two posts , fighting all the while to concentrate against the pounding in her body . " Now , " Matt whispered , " pull the trigger . " A great rush of blood swept to Ruth 's head as she snapped back the lever . The shot ricocheted from the cliff across the wash . The can flew off the rock . " Good shot . " The Indian 's voice came from behind them . Matt stepped back , and Ruth turned to find Jim and John Olsen heading toward the truck . " It was n't hard , " Ruth said , keeping all trace of surprise from her voice . She would not be flustered , though she could n't help but be impressed with herself . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to have so easily broken through one of the mysteries of the male world . She sashayed back toward her camp , taking the rifle with her . Setting the rifle and box of shells inside her tent , she went back out to say her good-byes . Matt reached out the truck window as John started the engine . " See you next week , " he said . " I 'll bring up those supplies from the store . Maybe your twenty-two will be in by then . " He gave her arm a quick squeeze when she came up beside him . " Be sure to keep that rifle handy . " " I 'll be all right " Ruth said . She climbed on the running board and poked her head in the window . " Thanks , John . For your help . Your truck too . And tell Kate thanks for the food . " " We neighbor now , Rute . Maybe you crazy , but neighbor . " Shaking his head , John put the truck in gear . " Up here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boulder . " " I will move that rock , " she assured him , though the truth was she 'd forgotten all about her promise until he reminded her . " Maybe John can loan you some dynamite , " Matt said , laughing . " Ya . We do n't use the dynamite . We svedge the onyx . " As the truck began to move , Ruth jumped from the running board and stood to one side while they backed onto the rut road . She gave a wave to Jim , who sat on the wooden flatbed , his back leaning against the cab . The Indian nodded , held her eyes as the truck pulled out and bumped on down the rough road . Ruth watched the truck disappear around the far bend of Rocky Mountain , waited until the drone of motor grew faint . Grateful as she had been for the men 's help , she had felt the canyon would not be fully hers until they were gone . When the engine sound faded into rushes of air playing in the pinyons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , nothing but a cotton shirt between her back and the place she had come to claim . Rough pebbles pressed into her skin beneath the cloth . Thin clouds spilled over the tops of the pine tree she had freed , its branches no longer encrusted with rusty tin cans . From somewhere an oriole strung a song through the air . She took in deep breaths of wildflower and pine and let the place seep into her , wanting the canyon to inhabit her as fully as she meant to inhabit it . When her senses were saturated , she burst to her feet , stretched her arms above her head . " Mine . Oh , it 's mine . Really all mine ! " she yelled , then listened as her words bounced back from the bluff across the wash . Of course , the place was n't quite hers yet . She still had to prove up on her homesteadto construct herself a structure out of the heap of building materials . And to move that damnable rock . She was required to stay three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortureliving here three whole years ! Crazed with joy , Ruth cackled out into the quiet canyon , and the rock cliff across the wash returned the sound of her laughter . When the echoes died , she walked over to the rock and studied it . As ridiculous as it seemed , there was something willful about that rock . As if it would moveor not moveall of its own accord . She climbed up on the saddleback of the stone , curved her legs around its cool sides . " Giddyup , " she said , almost expecting to ride the boulder like a small pony out of the range of her cabin site . The boulder did n't budge . She knew it did n't want to move anywhere . She knew also that this place could never be hers until she had moved this rock from her chosen spot . She had traveled far to find this place , so many things had come together to bring her herethose months spent in nurse training that enabled her to come west , all the small details dove-tailing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one rock stop her now . Matt said she 'd been lucky to get the building materials , thought it miraculous the way they 'd come available the day after she filed her claim . The sixty-five dollars needed was exactly what she had left after paying the filing fees . She suspected it was destiny at workthough she hated to think the death of the Henleys ' child and their sudden departure had come about in order to present her with the odd assortment of materials she needed . Can-Tree Springs in Rattlesnake Canyon had been the last of the sites Matt had taken her to see , and even then he seemed reluctant . Not even he had thought a woman would be interested in homesteading such an isolated claim so many miles away from Juniper Valleyor he did n't want her to be . But the place did have water , Matt admitted . Ruth had n't known herself just what she was looking for , but she knew the minute she found it . They had followed an old mining road that wound around the base of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rattlesnake Canyon , Matt 's Model A bucking the rough road all the way up . In the first hour they surprised three deer and stopped to kill a rattler . Hawks and buzzards circled overhead . When they started out , Ruth had a qualm or two about the isolation , but the farther they drove the more at home she felt . The very wildness of the canyon excited her . Some four miles up , the road cut through a long thicket of willows , and a small stream rose aboveground on one side . A few minutes later they arrived at a stone house tucked back on a flattened knoll . Goats galloped up and down the mountain , poked heads out from behind willows in the wash . " The Swedes ' place , " Matt said as he stopped in the road and set the hand brake . They would be her closest neighbors if she took the homestead , Matt told her , a mere four miles down canyon from her . The " Swedes " turned out to be John Olsen , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tents beside the stone house and hacked out a living mining onyx up the North Fork . ( Continues ... )
