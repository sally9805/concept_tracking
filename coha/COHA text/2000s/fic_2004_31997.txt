Chapter One DORTMUNDER SAT IN HIS living room to watch the local evening news , and had just about come to the conclusion that every multiple-dwelling residence in the state of New Jersey would eventually burn to the ground , three per news cycle , when the doorbell rang . He looked up , surprised , not expecting anybody , and then became doubly surprised when he realized it had not been the familiar blatt of the hall doorbell right upstairs here , but the never-hearding of the street-level bell , sounding in the kitchen . Rising , he left the living room and stepped out to the hall , to see May looking down at him from the kitchen , her hands full of today 's gleanings from her job at Safeway as she said , " Who is it ? " " Not this bell , " he told her , jabbing a thumb over his shoulder at the hall door . " The street bell . " " The street bell ? " Dortmunder clomped on back to the kitchen , to the intercom on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ landlord had just repaired in a blatant ploy to raise the rent . Not sure of the etiquette or operation of this piece of machinery , for so long on the inactive list , he leaned his lips close to the mouthpiece and said , " Yar ? " " It 's Andy , " said a voice that sounded like Andy being imitated by a talking car . " Andy ? " May said , " Let him in , John . " " Oh , yeah . " Dortmunder pressed the white bone button , and yet another unpleasant sound bounced around the kitchen . " Will wonders never cease , " May said , because Andy Kelp , who was occasionally Dortmunder 's associate in certain enterprises , usually just walked on into their place , having enjoyed the opportunity to hone his lockpicking skills . Dortmunder said , " What if he rings this one up here , too ? " " He might , " May said . " You never know . " " It 's an awful sound , " Dortmunder said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door , where he could listen to the echoes as Andy Kelp thudded up the stairs . When the thuds stopped , he leaned out to see Kelp himself , a sharp-nosed cheerful guy dressed casually in blacks and dark grays , come down the worn carpet in the hall . " You rang the bell , " Dortmunder reminded him-not quite an accusation . Kelp grinned and shrugged . " Respect your privacy . " What an idea . " Sure , " Dortmunder said . " Comonin . " They started down the hall and May , in the kitchen doorway , said , " That was very nice , Andy . Thoughtful . " " Harya , May . " " You want a beer ? " " Could n't hurt . " " I 'll bring them . " Dortmunder and Kelp went into the living room , found seats , and Dortmunder said , " What 's up ? " " Oh , not much . " Kelp looked around the living room . " We have n't talked for a while , is all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we still like the old acquisitions . " " So , " Kelp said , crossing his legs , getting comfortable , " how you been keeping yourself ? " " May 's been keeping me , " Dortmunder told him . " she 's still got the job at the Safeway , so we eat . " " I figured , " Kelp said , " you did n't call for a while , probly you did n't have any little scores in mind . " " Probly . " " I mean , " Kelp said , " if you did have a little score in mind , you 'd call me . " " Unless it was a single-o . " Kelp looked interested . " You had any single-os ? " " As a matter of fact , " Dortmunder said , as May came in with three cans of beer , " no . " May distributed the beer , settled into her own chair , and said , " So , Andy , what brings you here ? " " He wants to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without him , maybe with some other guys . " " Aw , naw , " Kelp said , casually waving the beer can . " You would n't do that , John . " Dortmunder drank some beer , in lieu of having something to say . May said , " What about you , Andy ? Anything on the horizon ? " " Well , there is one little remote possibility , " Kelp said , which of course would be the other reason he 'd happened to drop by . " I do n't know if John 'd be interested . " Dortmunder kept the beer can up to his face , as though drinking , while May said , " What would n't he like about it ? " " Well , it 's in New Jersey . " Dortmunder put the beer can down . " They got a lotta domestic fires in New Jersey , " he said . " I was just noticing on the news . " " Family feared lost ? " Kelp nodded . " I seen that sometimes . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speedshop . " " Oh , that , " Dortmunder said . Kelp said , " I know you had your troubles with that store in the past , but the thing is , they 're having this giant television sale . " " Got one , " Dortmunder said , pointing at it . ( He 'd turned it off when all the bell-ringing started . ) " Well , here 's my thinking , " Kelp said . " If they 're gon na have a giant sale on these things , it stands to reason they 're gon na have a bunch of them on hand . " " That 's right , " May said . " To fill the demand . " " Exactly , " Kelp said to May , and to Dortmunder he said , " I happen to know where there 's an empty semi we could borrow . " " You 're talking , " Dortmunder said , " about lifting and carrying a whole lot of television sets . Heavy television sets . " " Not that heavy , " Kelp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You see , I also happen to know a guy out on the Island , recently opened up a great big discount appliance store out there , Honest Irving , not one item in the store is from the usual channels , he 'll take everything off our hands but the semi , and I might have a guy for that , too . " " Honest Irving , " Dortmunder said . " His stuff is just as good as everybody else 's , " Kelp assured him , " same quality , great prices , only maybe you should n't try to take the manufacturer up on the warranty . " " Speedshop , " Dortmunder said , remembering his own after-hours visit to that place . " They got a lotta security there . " " For a couple guys like us ? " Kelp spread his hands to show how easy it would be , and the phone rang . " I 'll get it , " May said . She stood , left her beer behind , and headed for the kitchen , as the phone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath , " Kelp said , " but what a help for May it could be , I give you a nice little extension phone in here . " " No , thank you . " " One phone in an entire apartment , " Kelp said , and shook his head . " And not even cordless . You take back-to-basics a little too far back , John . " " I also do n't think , " Dortmunder said , " I wan na buck Speedshop , not again . I mean , even before the question of Honest Irving . " Kelp said , " Where 's a question about Honest Irving ? " " The day will come , an operation like that , " Dortmunder said , " all of a sudden you 've got this massive police presence in the store , cops looking at serial numbers , wanting bills of sale , all this paperwork , and whadaya think the odds are , we 're there unloading television sets when it happens ? " " A thousand to one , " Kelp said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dortmunder said , and May came in , looking worried . He looked at her . " What 's up ? " " That was Anne Marie , " she said , referring to Kelp 's live-in friend . " She says there 's a guy in the apartment , says he wants to see Andy , just waltzed in , wo n't give a name , just sits there . Anne Marie does n't like it . " " Neither do I , " Kelp said , getting to his feet . " I better go . " " John will go with you , " May said . There was a little silence as Dortmunder reached for his beer can . He lifted his eyes , and they were both looking at him . " Uh , " he said , and put the beer can down again . " Well , naturally , " he said , and got to his feet .
