The mother was healthy and the pregnancy normal . But as soon as her baby was born , doctors were struck by the infant 's extraordinary muscularity . By 7 months , he had a bodybuilder 's pumped-up proportions . Researchers determined that the baby had a double dose of a mutation that inactivates a protein that restrains muscle development ( a mutation also seen in mice and cattle ) . While scientists hope that pinpointing the mutation will help them learn how to reverse muscle wasting from disease , they also know that someday somebody will try to parlay it into a performance-enhancing drug .  --  By David Bjerklie
