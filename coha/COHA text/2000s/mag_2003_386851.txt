<p> <p> Hey , Howard , you should simply tell ' em , " Those who skied , also served . " <p> <p> Was President Bush 's Thanksgiving trip to Baghdad political ? Was it designed to provide an image  --  Bush serving turkey and fixings to troops  --  to supplant an earlier one  --  Bush on the deck of the U.S.S. Abraham Lincoln , in front of the banner declaring " Mission Accomplished " ? The answer to both questions is yes , and why not ? Politics at its most serious is about intentions and the means to achieve them ; as circumstances change , so must the means . When Bush landed on the Lincoln on May 1 , a mission had been accomplished : As Bush said , " major combat operations " had " ended . " He added that there was still " difficult work to do in Iraq . " It has proved more difficult , probably , than he expected . But unlike Bill Clinton , he has not sulked , held all-night bull sessions , or asked Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tactics to the situation on the ground , and he went to Baghdad to bond with the troops , and to show America , Iraq , and the world that we would beat the assassins . Call it politics  --  and leadership . <p> <p> After months of taking incoming rounds from the Democrats , President Bush returned fire in a 30-second ad the Republican National Committee is running in Iowa . The ad says that " some are now attacking the president for attacking the terrorists , " and " some call for us to retreat , putting our national security in the hands of others . " The response from the Democratic field indicates a direct hit . The rules of engagement they seek to impose permit hysterical charges against the president , but disallow any counterattack as an illegitimate questioning of his opponents ' patriotism . Senator Daschle demanded the ad be pulled . According to Wesley Clark , the TV spot amounts to accusing Democrats of " somehow aiding the enemy " and is a violation of " the pledge the president made not to exploit 9/11 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for president who have made Bush 's conduct of the War on Terror central to their campaigns . The RNC should n't be faulted for turning up the heat in the Democrats ' chosen kitchen . <p> <p> Remember Sheldon Drobny ? The Chicago millionaire venture capitalist had a brief moment of fame as the founder of a new liberal talk-radio network . Lionized by some on the left , he also gave voice to their worst excesses ; he once enthusiastically compared George W. Bush to Adolf Hitler . But Drobny never quite got the new network going , and now he has sold the enterprise to a group of businessmen who seem more likely to do the job . The investors , led by former Internet executive Mark Walsh , are hiring people , building studios , and , perhaps most important , buying radio stations in an attempt to be on the air early next year . They 've made other progress as well . For one thing , they realize how boring and didactic previous liberal talk efforts have been . For another , they have finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Left . And they do n't like the word " liberal "  --  Walsh prefers " centrist . " It all sounds good until you learn what the new network will actually do . The new bosses are going forward with the previous owners ' plans to air shows featuring comedian/Bush-basher Al Franken and comedienne/Bush-basher Janeane Garofalo ( who has referred to the Bush administration as " the , 43rd Reich " ) . Given that lineup , it seems likely that no matter how much Walsh wants his new effort to be " centrist , " it will end up being a forum for the angry Left . They just ca n't help themselves . <p> <p> One sometimes gets the impression that President Bush is running a protectionist administration and turning his back on decades of free-trade policies . That impression is incorrect . Administrations of both parties have for years pursued free trade as a general goal while also appeasing selected industries seeking protectionist favors . Such favors invariably impose a net cost on the economy . But since the costs are diffused while the benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organize politically to keep the favors coming . The steel tariffs that Bush imposed in 2002 conformed to the rule : Any help they gave to steelmakers was more than offset by the damage they did to companies that use steel . The difference this time is that the victims got organized . Political pressure from them , along with the threat of retaliatory tariffs from Europe , convinced the Bush administration to back off . The tariffs will go . But the administration has handed out a new favor : The textile industry will be protected from the menace of cheap Chinese lingerie . As we said before , this kind of small-scale protectionism is routine . The Clinton administration , often described as ardent for free trade , indulged in it . But the Clinton administration also took political risks to promote its broader free-trade agenda . So far , the Bush administration has sadly failed to take such risks . <p> <p> After three years of work by the administration and Congress , the energy bill had become a nearly perfect piece of Washington bipartisanship : It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reforms . Bush was pushing for its passage , and Tom Daschle was cooperative . After all , there were giveaways for South Dakota in the bill . But then the labor unions and Senate liberals noticed that there were still one or two free-market provisions in the bill , and decided to oppose it on that basis . A few Republican senators opposed the bill for the right reasons . The bill failed . Bush and Senate majority leader Bill Frist vow to take it up again next year . In that case , the dissenting Republicans will need to muster the will to say no again . <p> <p> Reportedly , the IRS is auditing the National Education Association , and students of the union 's political practices are betting that its new-math approach to its tax returns will flunk the exam . The Landmark Legal Foundation first filed a complaint against the NEA in 2000 , giving the IRS reams of documents detailing how the union spends tens of millions of its tax-exempt funds on politics  --  which is illegal . For the past ten years , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zero " general revenues on political activities . That duplicity lets them dodge taxes . It also keeps teachers in the dark about how their dues are used , which prevents them from asserting their right to a refund of dues spent on politics . Everyone talks about " accountability " in education . Let 's hope we now get some . <p> <p> What is wrong with this headline ? 46 IRAQIS DIE IN FIERCE FIGHT / BETWEEN REBELS AND G.I. 's ( New York Times , December 1 ) . The dead were from Iraq . But we are not at war with Iraq . Saddam Hussein 's regime , which we fought , is gone . Iraq is a nation of 25 million people , that was dominated by a totalitarian political movement , the remnants of which we are fighting . Calling the attackers " rebels " calls up Washington at Valley Forge , or Delacroix 's Liberty Guiding the People . Willmoore Kendall defined a liberal as someone who would not take his own side in a fight . That is true ; what is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ compass is regularly misled by random slag heaps . <p> <p> Public events pass before us , cloaked and blurry , in blizzards of talk , and then someone writes something that floods the scene with light . President Bush 's Thanksgiving trip to Baghdad was hailed by an Iraqi blogger , whose nom d'Internet is " The Mesopotamian . " His blog greeted the president as a " friend and ally , " and regretted that crowds could not come out to greet him as he deserved . Then he produced an almost Biblical sentence : " The bones in the mass graves salute you , Avenger of the Bones . " Iraqis , Americans , Mr. Bush : Remember that one . <p> <p> In certain European quarters , there has been a depressing squeamishness about confronting the proliferators of doomsday weapons . So perhaps it is n't surprising that , when the International Atomic Energy Agency entertained the idea of reporting Iran 's longstanding and clandestine nuclear-weapons program to the U.N . Security Council , squeamishness won the day . Germany , France , and Britain persuaded the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Iran 's nuke program without sending the matter to the U.N . Supporters of this approach claim it was necessary to avoid undermining reformers within the Iranian theocracy . That 's rather a rosy way of looking at things  --  and it risks simply giving Iran 's hardliners more time to realize their nuclear ambitions . Any further deception or heel-dragging on Iran 's part must be met with more than a slap on the wrist . We should heed undersecretary of state John R. Bolton 's words in a recent speech : " Whether the nuclear capabilities of states like Iran , North Korea , and others are threats today , or ' only ' threats ' tomorrow , ' there can be no dispute that our attention is required now before the threats become reality , and tens of thousands of innocent civilians , or more , have been vaporized . " <p> <p> The European Left and a good many of the 10 million or more Muslim immigrants on the continent come together in the common cause of hating Israel . Inevitably their generalized attack on Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ synagogues and shops , and anti-Jewish demonstrations , just as it was in the run-up to Hitlerism . Proud to be the standard-bearer of progressive values , the European Union has a Monitoring Center on Racism and Xenophobia . This center commissioned a study from another standard-bearer of progressive values , the Anti-Semitism Research Institute of the Technical University of Berlin . The study duly reported the self-evident fact that the Left 's raging against Israel incites young Muslims to increasingly frequent and violent anti-Semitism in all its many manifestations . Appalled to be confronted with the incontestable evidence of what 's happening , the Monitoring Center has trashed the findings of the report , is suppressing its publication , and is asking for a rewrite in order to reach quite different conclusions . In this best of all possible Europes , fear of giving offense to Muslim extremists has priority over human rights for Jews . <p> <p> Old Communists never die , they just fade away . Eduard Shevardnadze took his time to fade away . In the Seventies he was general secretary of the Communist party in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ruthlessness with rivals was notorious , and so was his toadying to Brezhnev . Under Gorbachev , he became a reformed character as foreign minister , one of the maestros of perestroika and glasnost . When the Soviet Union fell apart , he returned to Georgia , for the last lap of his career as president of a now sovereign state . He liked to present himself as a benevolent despot , but the habits of Communism died hard . Minorities were suppressed , corruption flourished , the prisons filled , and dissidents came to mysterious ends . Blatantly rigging an election against a democratic opposition , he finally went too far . Angry and partly armed crowds filled the streets . There 'd been civil war in the recent past , and it was on the verge of breaking out again . In command of the police , the hard-line interior minister was willing to open fire on the crowds . But like his former boss Gorbachev , Shevardnadze , in the crunch , rejected bloodshed , resigned , and went home to allow another velvet revolution to take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the manner of his departing calls for a measure of : forgiveness . <p> <p> Michael Jackson is accursed , largely through his . own deeds . Having lost his talent and his popularity , he has lost ( if he ever had ) his mind , living in a grotesque simulacrum of permanent childhood . Now he is to be tried for child molesting . A jury will come to a decision , as will the public ( we are perfectly flee , despite what priggish commentators tell us , to anticipate verdicts or judge them mistaken , as O. J. Simpson 's acquittal clearly was ) . Things certainly look bleak for Jackson . Keep in mind , however , that children 's testimony must be carefully evaluated , and that failure to do so produced a rash of unjust pedophilia convictions in the Eighties . Let us hope that Jackson is guilty of nothing more than self-destruction . <p> <p> As we go to press , a congressional bulletin tells us that : " The U.S. Capitol Holiday Tree is scheduled to arrive at the West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This year 's Holiday Tree , we are further informed , is from the Boise national forest in Idaho . It will be decorated with more than 6,000 holiday ornaments and 10,000 colored holiday lights . Residents of Washington , D.C. , will be able to admire the Holiday Tree as they bustle around doing their holiday shopping . Many of us will , of course , decorate our own homes with holiday lights and holiday wreaths . In our living rooms we shall put up holiday trees very much like the Capitol 's Holiday Tree , though of course much smaller . Under our holiday trees we shall pile holiday presents . To our friends and loved ones we shall send holiday cards . Perhaps we shall take our children to see a holiday show  --  a stage performance of Charles Dickens 's much-loved fable A Holiday Carol , perhaps . On Holiday Eve we may be serenaded by carol singers with " The Twelve Days of Holiday , or " We Wish You A Merry Holiday ! " Then we shall read the little ones to sleep with Clement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before Holiday . " . On Holiday itself we shall open our holiday presents and eat our holiday dimmer , then settle down to watch the holiday specials on TV . Remember , Holiday comes but once a year , so  --  Merry Holiday ? <p> <p> One of the foulest crimes against humanity in living memory was the famine deliberately caused by Josef Stalin in the Ukraine . At the time , Walter Duranty of the New York Times took a journey through the region , and saw the corpses of the dead and dying , many of them by the roadside and the train tracks . There was no need to fuss about a few unimportant local shortages , he then reported in a series of articles for the Times , and for this he was awarded the Pulitzer prize in 1932 . This archetypal fellow-traveler lied gladly for the Soviets , and his lies have dishonored the Pulitzer prize and the Times ever since . Ukrainians first and foremost have never forgiven him . The latest move to have Duranty 's prize revoked has failed . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though that of course disqualifies Duranty outright as a reporter . Arthur Sulzberger Jr. , publisher of the Times , thinks that revoking the prize would be like the Soviet practice of airbrushing people out of history . Hold on : It was Duranty who was airbrushing out victims by the million . But the Pulitzer board and Sulzberger do join in " extending sympathy to those who suffered . " How very , very kind of them . <p> Duranty and Stalin <p> <p> Carlos Eire is this year 's recipient of the National Book Award for nonfiction . Who is Eire ? He is a professor of history and religious studies at Yale , and the author of a memoir , Waiting for Snow in Havana , which won the award . The book depicts with humor the joys of childhood in Cuba . But it depicts more acutely the pain of separation , and the immigrant 's struggle to scratch a life from nothing . Eire and his brother came to the United States in Operation Pedro Pan . Their mother eventually joined them , but their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art and history , stayed behind to guard their home and his paintings , assuming the Communists ' time would be brief . He was wrong , and Eire never saw him  --  or anyone else who stayed  --  again . But while his relatives could not escape , their stories did : stories of resistance brutally stamped out . Eire 's story is theirs too , and is for all of those who saw their Cuba lost . Since it is a story that many people are loath to hear , the National Book Award comes as a pleasant , heartening surprise . <p> <p> The U.S. Postal Service has decided to insult history and human decency by issuing a stamp in honor of Paul Robeson . According to David Failor of the Postal Service , in the words of the Associated Press , " There was strong support from the public for a stamp honoring Robeson , who was labeled a subversive for his mid-century activism against racism and anti-Semitism . " Thank you , Ministry of Truth . If Paul Robeson opposed anti-Semitism , it certainly was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in 1941 . He was famous as a singer , as in Jerome Kern 's Showboat during the 1920s . But the songs he sang later were those not of Jerome Kern but of Josef Stalin , hamming it up much of the time in Moscow . He supported the Great Purges and the Gulag ; he was a menace to dissidents . It would have been more honest to put Gus Hall on a postage stamp . If Robeson never joined the Party , he was cheating it out of its dues . If honoring this Kremlin toady is supposed to honor American blacks , it is a condescending insult to the tens of thousands of black Americans who fought for their country in its and their wars . <p>
