ON A SCOUT CAMP-OUT , A SIMPLE MISTAKE TRIGGERS A DESPERATE SEARCH AND RESCUE . // FOR DAVID SCOTT THE VERY WORST PART WAS N'T TEH COLD , OR EVEN THE DARK . IT WAS HIS FEAR . I WORRIED ABOUT BEARS AND WOLVES . " DAVID SAYS OF THE LONG NITHE HE SPENT ALONE IN A MOUNTAIN WILDERNESS . " I WAS NERVOUS THAT I WAS N'T GOING TO GET OUT . " DAVID 'S STORY EASILY COULD HAVE ENDED BADLY . HIS HIS SURVIVAL IS A TRIBUTE BOTH TO THE BOY SCOUT 'S COOL-HEADEDNESS AND TO THE RAPID , COORDINATED EFFORT TO FIND AND RESCUE HIM . YET HIS ORDEAL RAISES AN IMPORTANT TRUTH : A LIFE CAN HANG ON A SIMPLE JUDEGMENT ERROR THAT MANY KIDS AND ADULTS MIGHT MAKE-BUT THAT NONE EVER SHOULD . A Great Start David was new to Troop 261 in Castle Rock , Colo. , having been a member for only a few months . He had extensive camping experience with his family . However , the troop 's spring fishing trip to the Pike National Forest was his first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such rugged terrain . Photograph // Saturday , May 19 , began happily for the troop 's 42 Scouts , who camped in broad meadows along Jackson Creek . The sun was shining , and the trout were biting . Then the clouds moved in . By lunchtime it was sprinkling . By early afternoon it began to pour . Guys pulled on their ponchos . Some , including David , sat around the fire , trying to keep the flames going . A couple of 15-yearold Life Scouts walked up to say they were going hiking . " I asked them if I could come , " David recalls . " And they said , Yeah . " ' He grabbed his backpack and headed out with the older boys . David wore cotton pants and a brand-new green Troop 261 T-shirt , with sneakers and a cap . Moving downstream from camp , the three Scouts climbed part way up a steep ridge covered with pine , aspen and scrub oak . Visibility was poor . About 100 yards from camp , they encountered a blackened tree stump . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they wanted to go rock climbing . David was n't interested . " I 'd never done it , " he says . " So I just said I 'd head back , and they said , ' O.K. ' They did n't come with me . " Poor Choice The boys were well-drilled in the buddy system , and each knew his responsibilities . Although camp was within earshot , the ridge was too steep and the vegetation too thick for David to navigate his way back alone . As the buddy system dictates , all three should have returned to camp together , but they did n't . It was about 4:30 . David retraced his steps to the blackened stump , where the trail back to camp led to the right . He turned left , however , in the mistaken belief that camp was downstream , not upstream , from the stump . The rain finally stopped , but the weather remained gray and raw as he moved along , growing ever more nervous . Did I go the wrong way or not ? David asked himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get his bearings , but that did n't help . " I did n't recognize anything , " he says . He also encountered what appeared to be a small construction site . A truck was parked nearby . David called out , did n't get an answer , and kept moving . Back down the slope , David slipped on gigantic granite boulders along the stream bed . He fell feet first into the cold water . Luckily , he suffered only an enormous bruise on one leg . But his pants were now soaked up to his thighs , and the slow-drying cotton would become more and more uncomfortable as the mountain temperatures turned colder . Alerting Search and Rescue It was about this time , an hour or so after he split up with the other two Scouts , that David Scott at last realized he probably was lost . Scared , he started to cry . Back in camp , David 's disappearance was discovered as the Scouts gathered for dinner . Two dads from the new Scout patrol immediately set out to search the area where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of him , the dads radioed Scoutmaster Michael Krueger , who dispatched teams of older boys to search both sides of the creek . Still nothing . About 7:30-roughly an hour before dark-Mr . Krueger dialed 911 to alert the local volunteer search and rescue squad , who were on the scene within 30 minutes . He also telephoned David 's parents back in Castle Rock . The lost Scout meantime had composed himself . He took inventory of his backpack : pocketknife , flashlight and a plastic quart bottle of water . No watch . No compass . No matches . Not great . Photograph // Just before dusk , David happened across a little shed , locked tight . Hoping to rest inside for the night , he pitched bricks at its boarded-up windows , tried his pocketknife screwdriver on the door hinges , even flung himself , shoulder first , at the door . No luck . David built a wall of bricks beneath the shed 's eave , then bedded down behind it , using his backpack for a pillow . He placed his pocketknife nearby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a red lens in case he needed to signal searchers in the dark . Search and rescue teams , nearly 60 people in all , crisscrossed the surrounding forest . Two teams of " air scent " tracking dogs joined the search . Hours passed . The clouds disappeared . A light wind came up , and the temperature dropped as low as 35 . David slept fitfully . He awoke once to see the Big Dipper and prayed he would one day see it again-with his family . He heard scary noises all night : birds , creaking limbs , scuttling sounds in the near distance . " I 'd try to go to sleep , " he explains , " then I 'd dream someone was there in the trees or in the shadows of this shed , or sitting next to me . But there was no one there . I got really frustrated . " At first light , David built a wooden cross , and put his cap and T-shirt on it as a ground signal . Then he gathered up debris-bricks , wood and old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 18 feet long , in an open area . Now all he could do was wait , and hope . Three or four hours later , the cold and hungry Scout looked up to see a TV news chopper suddenly overhead . David had been found . A Lesson Learned David was n't the only person to lose his way that weekend . Several hours after his rescue , and about 50 miles away , three adult hikers were trapped by a sudden snowstorm . They spent a miserable night on the mountain before their rescue on Monday morning . Paramedics examined and released David . A couple of weeks later , he received his Tenderfoot Scout badge and the Wilderness Survival merit badge at a special ceremony . But happy and proud as he was , David had found a new respect for the outdoors , and for the rules that all outdoorsmen , including Scouts , must follow to keep safe . As Scoutmaster Krueger explains : " All three boys made a bad decision . They broke the buddy group . The older boys were very upset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not a good call . I doubt they 'll ever make the same decision again . " GETTING HOME ALIVE It you become lost , the first rule is S.T.O.P : Stay calm . Think . Observe . Plan . Keeping your head is key , says Dave Bates , director of camping and conservation for the Boy Scouts of America . " Fight the urge to panic , " he adds . " Get control of yourself . " Photograph // If you know what direction you 've been traveling , and how far you 've come , then you may consider backtracking . Otherwise , he says , your wisest choice is probably to stay put , conserve energy and concentrate on calling atention to yourself . The best signal is one that moves . Mr. Bates suggests rigging up a flag or streamer during the day . At night , if you 're in an open area , a signal fire is a good idea . Prepare yourself for survival by researching what to do if you get lost . " The Outdoor Survival Handbook " by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a variety of situations from emergencies in the mountains or the desert to what medical supplies to carry with you into the wilderness .
