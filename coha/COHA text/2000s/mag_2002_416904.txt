Scientists are treated as objective arbiters in the cloning debate . But most have serious skin in the game . <p> THERE 'S HARDLY AN ISSUE MORE difficult to untangle  --  or more important to the future of science and medicine  --  than that of human cloning and stem cells . But for reporters charged with covering the debate , sorting out the questions involved is as difficult as explaining the science behind them . <p> There 's one argument over whether the government should ban researchers from using embryos that are going to get thrown away at fertility clinics , on the claim that they are human lives even if they 're going to be destroyed anyway . There 's another , slightly different argument , over whether scientists should be allowed to clone adult cells to produce embryos , from which scientists can then extract embryonic stem cells  --  cells which could , in theory , be transplanted back into the original adult patient for different forms of therapy . There 's still another dispute over whether adult stem cells are even viable alternatives in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> When covering these debates , reporters often try to use university scientists as objective arbiters . Politicians and interest groups may be motivated by ideology , but the scientists  --  they presume  --  are sticking to the facts . But the funny thing is , scientists do n't necessarily agree about the facts . For instance , David Prentice , a biologist at Indiana State University , has been quoted in dozens of newspaper articles as an advocate for the position that you can limit the use of embryonic stem cells without hurting scientific research . And then there 's somebody like Irving Weisman , a Stanford scientist and past chair of a prestigious panel on cloning at the National Academy of Sciences , who 's been quoted in over 160 newspaper articles in recent years defending the opposite position  --  that embryonic stem cells are essential to future advances in medical science and technology . <p> Part of the explanation , of course , is simply an honest difference of opinion among scientists grappling with difficult emerging questions . But there 's a deeper problem at work which journalists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that overlap with their scientific views . For instance , Prentice specializes in studying stem cells taken from adults , not embryos , and has sought a federal grant from the National Institutes of Health for his work ; federal curbs on embryo research would " obviously " free more funds for his approach , he says , and if his research pans out , Prentice will market the resulting procedures via a biotech company  --  a company which would have better prospects were embryo-cell cloning outlawed by the government . By the same token , Weissman has already made millions of dollars through three companies he 's founded  --  Systemix Inc. , Celltrans Inc. , and StemCells Inc. , the last two of which he still helps manage  --  which use stem-cell technology . When President Bush announced last August that he would give narrow support to such technology , the market value of the StemCells Inc. briefly shot up by 45 percent . <p> But these two scientists are n't the problem . Both Weissman and Prentice are entirely candid regarding their financial and business interest in the debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ press , which almost never informs its readers that these supposedly disinterested scientists have great financial stakes in the debate . Prentice is invariably cited as an " Indiana State University biologist " ; Weissman nearly always as " a professor at Stanford . " And the same goes for dozens of other scientists who mix business and academia , substantially affecting the cloning debate in America and even abroad . The Doctor Is In <p> Today , many university scientists are neither teachers nor disinterested experts , but a hybrid  --  part executive and part researcher  --  pursuing new and little-understood business strategies . Like most academics , they have university affiliations and spend most of their time performing research . But unlike , say , English professors , their research generates promising new medical patents and technologies , on which scientists can capitalize by launching their own off-campus biotech companies . These companies rarely sell therapies directly to patients . Instead they usually sell the fruits of their research  --  such as a gene-analysis device or a special type of laboratory animal  --  to large , established firms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be drawn upon to produce products or therapies for the consumer market . The research performed by academic entrepreneurs thus acts as a kind of catalyst on the broader field of biotechnology , which means that everyone involved  --  the entrepreneurs , universities , investors , and the firms who license patented technologies  --  prefer that it be as unrestricted as possible . In this context , stem-cell cloning is especially valuable , both as a commercial technique in and of itself and as a tool that can accelerate research into a myriad of human conditions , from male-pattern baldness to Lou Gehrig 's disease . <p> By keeping one foot in business and one in the university , these scientist-businessmen get the best from both worlds . As academics , they get plaudits from their peers , the approval of colleagues serving on federal grant-review boards , and early access to hot new discoveries  --  not to mention federally subsidized laboratory space and an endless supply of underpaid graduate students eager to help develop the next cutting-edge idea . As entrepreneurs , they get access to wealth and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or third company . <p> These academic entrepreneurs are not exotic creatures , but rather the model of what university science is rapidly becoming . Since 1980 , according to the Association of University Technology Managers , American universities have spun-off more than 3,000 companies . From 1999 to 2000 alone , universities ' revenues from spin-off companies , licensing deals , and outside investment shot up from $862 million to $1.26 billion . Spin Doctors <p> But reporters almost always fail to identify the conflicts of interest that such a business environment spawns , especially when it comes to the cloning debate . Take Harvard 's Doug Melton , who has founded two biotech companies , including Curis Inc. , where he is the chief scientist overseeing the development of stem-cell products , including potential therapies that could use embryo cloning . Not surprisingly , Melton is an outspoken advocate of federal support for embryonic stem-cell research , and was fine of three experts invited by the White I louse to brief President Bush last year on the merits of such research . But in 35 out of 36 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ embryonic stem-cell research , reporters described him only as a Harvard professor ; not a single article on Lexis-Nexis cited his work at Curis , other than one I wrote for the National Journal . <p> In one July 2001 Washington Post article , the paper 's chief science writer , Rick Weiss , quoted Melton saying " it would be very ill-advised to close the door on the production of new stem-cell lines . " But Weiss described Melton only as " chairman of molecular and cellular biology at Harvard University . " There was no mention of Curis , even though if Bush had chosen to come out against embryonic stem-cell research , Melton 's firm would have had great difficulty raising investment capital . Weiss denies it 's a problem . " Melton has a son who has diabetes , " he says . " Should I mention in every story that he has a son with diabetes ? I do n't think so , but that 's certainly one of his motivations , and for all I know , it is a greater motivation than profit from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Washington Times has made similar omissions . In nine articles during 2000 and 2001 , reporter August Gribbin quoted Lawrence Goldstein , whom he described as a professor at the University of California at San Diego . In an August 2001 article , Goldstein defended cloning for therapies , and wondered whether a ban might violate the Constitution . " Does the government really have the constitutional ability , " he asked Gribbin , " to prohibit across the board something that has no obvious harm to people , but could benefit those who are ill ? " This is , of course , a perfectly defensible position . But readers might rightly question Goldstein 's motives for offering it if they knew of his role as co-founder of Cytokinetics Inc. , a biotech firm in San Diego , or his role as a lobbyist on behalf of the American Society for Cell Biology . Why do these connections matter ? Cytokinetics examines human cells for features that could be developed into drugs and therapies for pharmaceutical firms , and so relies on a high pace of discoveries in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be accelerated through wide laboratory use of stem cells . The ASCB , which promotes public policies favored by scientists based in companies and universities , favors stem-cell research for similar reasons . But when I asked Gribbin why , he explained that " it was not a business story " and that " I was writing about the news of the day ... there was no time or intent to include his financial interests " Gribbin is not alone : Only one out of 76 articles in various papers quoting Goldstein mentions his business ties . <p> Conversely , in another article , The Washington Times quoted Indiana State 's David Prentice as an opponent of embryonic cloning , but without disclosing his financial interest in banning embryonic cloning techniques . When asked , Victor Morton , an editor at the Times , said the paper does n't have a policy regarding university scientist 's business ties , and usually reprinted wire-service copy as is . Patent Medicine <p> Many scientists also have financial interests in the extension or revocation of patents held by their academic competitors on lucrative procedures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for instance , generated almost $20 million in 2001 from such biotech patents . But this is another area in which reporters are less than conscientious . For example , two top stem-cell researchers , James Thomson of the University of Wisconsin and John Gearhart of the Johns Hopkins University , won patents on the most widely used methods for extracting stem cells from human embryos and aborted fetuses . The revenue from those patents goes both to the two inventors and to their universities ' deans , department chiefs , and many others . Should Congress decided to curb the use of Thomson and Gearhart 's method , all of them stand to lose millions of dollars . <p> Yet when the Chicago Tribune ran a profile of Thomson in December 2001 , reporters Ronald Kotulak and Peter Gorner depicted Thomson only as " a young , untenured veterinarian and Ph.D . molecular biologist ... in his lab at the University of Wisconsin , " and then quoted him as saying " I think stem cells can revolutionize human medicine , but it 's going to be a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and contains the appropriate caveat . But readers should also have been told that Thomson and his colleagues stand to make millions of dollars from their patent should embryonic stem-cell cloning come into wide use . <p> Gorner says he did not include Thomson 's business interests because Thomson " is kind of an innocent " about the financial stakes in the debate . Gorner says he tries hard to include the financial aspects in his science stories , and has written a long piece detailing the finances of the medical center which holds Thomson 's patent . In the Tribune , Gorner says , " we go to great lengths to get the financial data because it is just assumed that everyone in the science business is on the take , and they are shameless about it . " But he concedes that most of the media 's science reporters are very reluctant to question scientists about their financial interests , partly because such questions would threaten the reporters ' access to cutting-edge science news . " My colleagues are suckers for university-based entrepreneurs . I do n't give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these kinds of mistakes was made by The New York Times ' Nicholas Wade in an article on the discovery of a versatile new type of stem cell found in adults , known as " Multipotent Adult Progenitor Cells . " Previously unknown , these cells can be mass-produced for researchers , and may prove very useful for disease therapies . Wade described their discovery by Catherine Verfaillie , a professor at the University of Minnesota , as a significant advance , and then included comments from Stanford 's Weissman and another scientist , Fred Gage of the Salk Institute , which is part of the University of California in San Diego . Both were skeptical of Verfaillie 's discovery , although Weissman did say it could be " very important " if other scientists  --  himself included  --  were given some of the cells to verify her claims . But Wade neglected to mention these scientists ' rival interests . Whereas Gage and Weissman are co-founders of Stemcells Inc. , which develops techniques for using adult stem cells , Verfaillie 's patented " MAPC " stem cells could steal market @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Weissman 's professional expertise . <p> When I asked him , however , Wade said that there was no need to mention the rival business interests because they are routine among scientists , and because they pose less of a problem than that caused by the scientists ' professional rivalries . Besides which , " my own feeling is that the reader is not interested , " he said , and the column inches are better used to communicate other information . When I called Cornelia Dean , editor of science news at The New York Times , she responded that " we try to include in our articles all the information people need to make sense of what is going on . " The Times ' policy , she said , is to cite the commercial sponsors of newsworthy medical studies , and to ask quoted scientists about " financial ties . " But she was very reluctant to discuss the problem any further , and seemed particularly surprised when I mentioned that Times op-ed contributor Jerome Groopman , a noted supporter of unfettered stem-cell and cloning research , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ( as the Times op-ed cutlines describe him ) , but is also a board member of Advanced Tissue Sciences Inc. , a biotech company in La Jolla , Calif . " The issue you are talking about is very important ... and you should not assume deficiencies are intentional , " she said as she ended the conversation . Which Doctor <p> Why are journalists so lax in describing these businesses and conflicts of interest ? For one thing , the academic entrepreneurs do generate many lifesaving or useful discoveries . Also , the traditional titles  --  scientist , professor , or dean  --  are technically correct , and editors in general are inclined to avoid extensive identification information about sources . And there 's a good reason why : Stories would quickly become unreadable if bogged down by long descriptions of every scientist 's business interests , like warning labels so long that consumers ignore them . Moreover , to say that a conflict of interest exists is not to say that scientists are being dishonest . Many scientists oppose cloning bans in part simply because it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose any new regulations on mining , no matter how minor . But many of these oft-quoted scientists do possess , and come from universities and research centers that do possess , a financial interest in one side or the other of the biotech debate . The problem is that the media 's conception of scientists  --  as objective academics cocooned in the ivory tower  --  keeps reporters from informing readers of financial interests that may motivate scientists ' advocacy . <p> It would be closer to the truth to describe scientists who have management or advisory duties in at least one company as what they are : " academic entrepreneurs , " not scientists . Similarly , academic scientists who do not have direct financial stakes in companies , but who still receive income from companies that license their patents , should be described as such : " the recipient of patent royalties . " If quoted scientists are linked to institutions , reporters should note whether those institutions are funded in whole or in part by firms with a stake in what 's being written about . And when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the university 's " technology transfer " programs , whose task is to maximize revenue generation from the sale or licensing of the university 's discoveries to industry . Gorner , at The Chicago Tribune , says one remedy would be a new type of beat that includes some aspect of his science beat , and some aspects of a traditional business beat , overseen by an editor who understands the role of money in biotech . " The rules are different in the two fields , and we need to synthesize them . " <p> This proposal to better link university-based scientists with their financial interests puts the scientists on an equal plane with other entrepreneurs who stand to gain or lose from Washington 's political debates . Voters already know that arms manufacturers will likely gain if Congress increases the defense budget , that oil executives will likely gain if Congress eases environmental laws , and that automakers will likely gain if federal safety standards are lowered . This understanding allows voters to judge better the credibility of industry claims whenever the industry is embroiled in a national debate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears to be relevant , " says Washington Post executive editor Len Downie . " And it appears that we are not doing enough . " <p> By Neil Munro <p> <p> NEIL MUNRO covers the politics of the technology business for National Journal . <p>
