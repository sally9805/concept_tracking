In photographer Hannah Starkey 's world , everyday occurrences take on extraordinary significance . By Alice Rawsthorn Photograph Irish eyes : Starkey in Dublin earlier this year , for her solo exhibition at the Irish Museum of Modern Art . // EVERY MORNING , HANNAH STARKEY scours her newspaper for what she calls " trivial stories with a tragic edge One she clipped was the saga of 52 Russian teenagers being trampled to death while fleeing a rock concert . Another was the tale of a girl who too two schoolmates to court for bullying her , lost the case , and killed herself . At first glance , it is hard to find traces of these real-life dramas in Starkey 's photographs of ordinary women in ordinary places , but they are there . " That story of the girl who stood up to the bullies is heroic-epic , really , " says . Starkey , who at 29 is one of Britain 's brightest young photographers . " It will end up in my work somewhere , but not directly . I work with the minutiae @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actors as characters and directing them as if she were making a movie , Starkey packs her everyday scenes with narrative and emotional possibilities . In Untitled-May 1997 , an older woman stares at a younger one in a diner . Do they know each other ? Or is the older woman remembering her youth ? In another photograph , of teenagers in a video store ( Untitled-January 2000 ) , the repetitive reflections of the shop lights , even the pyramidal shape of the girls ' coats , turn the image into a futuristic fantasy . Starkey 's cinematic scenarios will be showcased in I Am a Camera , an exhibition opening next month at the Saatchi Gallery in London . Charles Saatchi , best known in the States for the controversial Sensation show at the Brooklyn Museum of Art , has been buying Starkey 's work since she graduated from London 's Royal College of Art three years ago . Newspaper stories may provide an undercurrent , but Starkey 's work is scripted mostly from her own experiences . " As an artist , you 're always trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That 's why so many women artists my age are fascinated by teenage girls . There are so many contradictions then , between life being complicated yet amazingly free . " Starkey spent her own youth in Belfast at the height of its political and religious violence . She recalls curfews and days off school due to riots , though she says it seemed more like an adventure than anything else . " My parents were n't political , " says Starkey . " They 're Catholic but always said that if I was asked my religion I should say Christian . " Starkey now lives in London with her husband , Nat Sharman , a TV documentary director . She finds subjects by placing classified ads in actors ' magazines and combs the city for locations . Right now , she is scouting out " hypermodern " settings for the new project she plans to start this spring . Having spent the fall devouring The Great Gatsby and watching movies like The Ice Storm and the 1959 classic Suddenly , Last Summer , Starkey is plotting a change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she confides . " And the themes will be more fantastical . I 'm ready for that now .
