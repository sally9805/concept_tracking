<p> Bay Area filmmakers Wendy Slick and Emiko Omori never imagined that it would take more than seven years to make a documentary about one electrical appliance . They were wrong . <p> Their subject was the history of vibrators . <p> " Wendy and I both came out of the sex and drugs and rock ' n ' roll generation , " Omori said . " We thought we knew it all . We hardly knew anything . " <p> " Passion &; Power : The Technology of Orgasm " premieres at Lincoln Center in New York on Saturday and will be screened at the Mill Valley Film Festival in October . The cast of characters includes two feminist pioneers , a homemaker arrested for selling vibrators at Tupperware-like parties in Texas and Rachel Maines , a scholar who in 1977 stumbled upon turn-of-the-century ads for the device while researching needlework patterns . <p> " The vibrator was contemporaneous with the toaster and before the steam iron and vacuum cleaner , " Maines said in a phone interview . " We had our priorities right . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of pleasure were more than a sexual tool  --  they were political , social and subversive as well . <p> Nobody is more aware of that than Maines , who wrote an article on vibrators for the June 1989 edition of Technology and Society , a venerable publication from the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers . <p> The magazine 's technical advisory board insisted that " Socially Camouflaged Technologies : The Case of the Electromechanical Vibrator " was a hoax perpetrated by the editors of the journal as a parody of a typical IEEE offering , replete with " dozens and dozens of obsolete references . " <p> " They did a full-scale investigation , " said Maines , now a visiting scholar at Cornell University in Ithaca , N.Y . " I had to prove that I existed and I had to give them a Social Security number . My husband called it the attack of the dweebs . " <p> The article led to a book , " The Technology of Orgasm : Hysteria , the Vibrator and Women 's Sexual Satisfaction . " Published in 1999 by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a series that included works on household plumbing , air conditioning , the vertical water wheel and cotton mills . <p> Soon after the book came out , Slick and Omori resolved to turn it into a documentary  --  but they had to compete with 11 rivals for the film option before winning out . <p> " We were always doing socially worthwhile things nobody wanted to fund , " Omori said . " We figured that sex would be a no-brainer . " <p> It was n't . The two longtime filmmakers received just one foundation grant , and had to use their own money and private donations to subsidize the movie , which cost just under $150,000 . <p> " There was a network of women who supported this , " said Slick , sitting in her Mill Valley studio with Omori , who lives in San Francisco 's Bernal Heights neighborhood . <p> Slick said she was astonished by what she read in Maines ' book . " It was an unknown story , " she said . " How did we not know this ? " <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and vibrators . Maines wrote that gynecological massage had been a standard medical treatment for " hysteria "  --  viewed as the womb 's response to sexual deprivation  --  since antiquity . In the 1860s , an American physician created the Manipulator , a steam-powered device . Two decades later , Dr. Mortimer Granville of Britain invented the electromechanical vibrator , though he intended it solely for male skeletal muscles and warned that it would be morally indefensible to use it on women . Some of his colleagues thought otherwise . It could take more than an hour of manual labor to induce the " hysterical paroxysm , " as it was called . With the aid of the vibrator , this could more profitably be achieved in less than 10 minutes . <p> " When you think of people producing orgasm for payment , the word that leaps to mind is not doctors , " Maines said during the phone interview . <p> In 1899 , the vibrator was introduced as a home medical appliance and appeared in magazine advertisements by 1904 . An ad in a 1918 Sears Roebuck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a $5.95 portable model as " very useful and satisfactory for home service . " <p> Some of the vibrators shown in the documentary look as if they belong in a torture chamber . Others seem better suited for use in one 's kitchen . By 1930 , at least a dozen U.S. companies were manufacturing the devices . <p> Maines wrote that sexuality was never explicit in the ads and " the utility of the product for female masturbation was thus consistently camouflaged . " However , when vibrators started popping up in erotic films in the 1920s , their cover was blown as a medical aid . Most of the ads disappeared and vibrators went underground , resurfacing decades later with the help of the feminist movement , the sexual revolution and Betty Dodson , who is known as the " godmother of the masturbation movement . " <p> In the documentary , Dodson  --  whose workshops taught females to go places no man had gone before  --  recalls how a male lover suggested that they experiment with a barber 's scalp massager . It produced spectacular orgasms that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to use vibrators . Her message was consistent : " Independent orgasm , I guarantee , will lead to independent thoughts . " <p> The movie also presents footage of a much younger Dodson in 1974 at the groundbreaking Women 's Sexuality Conference in New York City . That gathering was coordinated by another feminist pioneer , Dell Williams , at the request of the National Organization for Women . In " Passion &; Power , " she describes how a boyfriend discussed the concept of the clitoris with her . <p> " I did n't even know I had one , " Williams said . <p> The filmmakers said it was inspiring to get to know Dodson and Williams , who opened Eve 's Garden , a store in Manhattan for women 's sex toys , in the early 1970s . At the same time , Slick said , it was reassuring to learn that these icons had plenty of insecurities  --  such as when Dodson confesses in the film that she used to think she was deformed because she had " elongated inner lips . " <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rules , as Slick put it . Performance artist Reno reveals how she discovered at a young age the pleasures that bathtub fixtures could provide . Texas housewife Joanne Webb recounts her arrest in 2004 for selling vibrators  --  in her state , a felony offense . Lawyer BeAnn Sisemore talks about defending Webb , whose life fell apart as a result of the case . <p> The documentary itself , much like early vibrator ads , is tasteful yet provocative . <p> " We 're too risque for PBS but not enough for HBO , " Omori said . <p> During a trip to Los Angeles , Slick said , they spoke to one man in the industry who urged them to add a scene with mirrors on the floor . They ignored that suggestion . <p> " We did n't want to be too clinical , " Omori said . <p> Some segments were shot in New York and Texas , others in the Bay Area . Maines was interviewed in a lavish Victorian home near Alamo Square , which the filmmakers found by calling a wallpaper association in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ job , " Maines said . " It 's quite different from the book but it encompasses more things . It was a real San Francisco experience for me . I was out there three times . It was kind of like a slumber party for middle-aged women . " <p> The documentary , made with a small-format digital video camera , contains almost no men but several sea creatures , as well as water motifs and historic footage of women marching and burning their bras  --  all the while wearing dresses and clutching their purses . Slick and Omori said universities and women 's studies programs throughout the country have shown interest in the film . <p> " It opens up something , " Omori said . <p> A scholar she knows started divulging details of her sex life . Another woman said the jellyfish in " Passion &; Power " reminded her of how she felt when she had an orgasm . And the movie was well received at a sex conference for therapists and educators in North Carolina . <p> " We got a five-minute standing ovation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before .
