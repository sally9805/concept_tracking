<p> Cool weather , impending reunions and the winter holidays have many of us looking for a new indoor exercise program and diet plans . <p> Slick ads promising sleek and sexy physiques are tempting , but how can you pick a facility or program so that it will produce results , be safe and be worth the money and time you invest ? <p> The three basic components of a good fitness program involve strength training , cardiovascular stimulation for heart and lung health , and a balanced diet . This is true for people of all ages and fitness levels . No two people will get the same results , even from the same program , so look for a gym that will allow you to improve at your own pace , not someone else 's idea of what your pace should be . <p> People starting an exercise and diet program for the first time - or those with experience who are just looking for something new - can find the options overwhelming . So the first thing to do is take a step back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to be . <p> Get a physical <p> Schedule a physical and after getting an assessment from a medical professional , take an honest look at yourself . <p> What have you done and , more important , enjoyed in the past ? Did you join a gym and never go ? Do you own every diet book ever published yet never seem to be able to keep the pounds off ? Did you buy some home exercise equipment offered by TV infomercials that is currently being used as a doorstop ? If the answer is a sheepish " yes , " it is time to re-evaluate the quality of your choices . <p> Take a tour <p> If you are thinking of switching to or trying out a new facility or private program , make sure the staff is qualified to lead and supervise ; the equipment is safe and up-to-date ; and there is adequate supervision of your progress as well as the premises in general . <p> Regardless of whether you want to change your diet , try a specialized fitness program ( such as boxing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general fitness program ( such as one-on-one personal training or group weight lifting ) , you should have more than a fleeting conversation about your medical history with a dietitian or trainer ( many facilities have people with both skills ) . <p> " People need a personalized program because one size does not fit all , " says Anne Parker , a certified strength and conditioning coach and owner of Parker Fitness Inc . " Some may need more work on strength , others more focus on diet . It is the trainer 's responsibility to focus on their specific strengths and weaknesses . " <p> Marc A. Rabinoff , professor at Metropolitan State College of Denver and forensic specialist on sports injuries , is often called as an expert witness in cases involving sports-related injuries that occurred at health clubs . <p> He recommends performing a safety audit when considering a fitness facility , checking to see if instructions are posted on or near equipment that clearly explain how to use it . Also important is that machines that need to be anchored are secure and that cables are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Carpets and floors should be clean and it 's a plus when disinfectant spray and paper towels are available for cleaning equipment after use . <p> Diet tuneup <p> Most people forget that the word " energy " is just another word for " calorie . " When calorie intake ( energy consumed ) is cut below calorie expenditure ( energy used ) - even as little as 10 percent - weight will be lost . Any calorie-restricting diet will work if it is one that you will stick to , but the key to success is finding one that is healthy and well-balanced . <p> Do n't fall into the trap of picking up a copy of whatever fad diet is being touted by talk-show hosts and celebrities . While diet books and products do a good job making their authors ' wallets fat - Americans spend $40 billion annually on diet products - 63 percent of adults remain overweight . <p> Instead of buying a book , find paper and pen and start keeping a food diary . Write down everything you eat ( no cheating ) for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habits and cravings which set you up for trouble or which add nutritionally empty calories to your daily fare . <p> If you are confused about how to change your eating habits or need a boost to get back on track , schedule time with a registered dietitian . ( Find one by calling the American Dietetic Association referral line at 800-366-1655 ) . An hour or two with a good RD is a far better investment of time and money than most books on the market . Also , a nutritionist is not a registered dietitian . Anyone can call himself a nutritionist regardless of training or background . RDs are licensed professionals with years of training , qualifying them to give diet advice designed specifically for you . Interview several before investing because , like fitness trainers , this is a relationship that also involves the establishment of trust and rapport . <p> Linda J. Buch is a certified fitness trainer in Denver and co-author of " The Commercial Break Workout . " Write her at linda@LJbalance.com <p> Find the right gym <p> Here are some ideas from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the facility is not within 10-15 minutes of where you live or work , will you go ? <p> 2 . Staff . Professional certification of all instructors is a must . Do you also require other professionals on the premises , like massage therapists or dietitians ? <p> 3 . Programs . If you need a lot of variety to choose from , regardless of whether it is classes or equipment , take that into consideration . Also , ask for a trial workout during the times you want to use the facility to be sure you like the space , availability of equipment you want to use , and the crowd level . <p> 4 . Equipment . There should be enough so that you do not have to wait and all pieces should be up-to-date with maintenance . <p> 5 . Facility . The club or studio should be clean with enough towels in the locker rooms and safe , well-lit parking . <p> 6 . Social . Meeting people with similar interests can make for a better workout experience as well as motivation . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better with all women ? Or in more of a bodybuilder atmosphere ? Or do you need day care on the premises ? <p> Pick the right program <p> Watch for these red flags : <p> 1 . Beware of any exercise or diet program promoter who refuses to tell you what you want to know until after you pay your money . Exercise science continues to evolve and studies revealing better information are published every day . There are no " secrets " and there is no " magic . " <p> 2 . Beware of enigmatic presentations where the activity/diet promoted is " exclusive " ( a euphemism for " profitable . " ) <p> 3 . Beware of any program that claims to be the only correct and effective exercise program on the planet , mocking all others . Everyone is different and no one diet or exercise plan will work for everyone . If the program is painful , repetitive and boring , or if you are told to eliminate entire food groups from your daily fare , should you make it a lifestyle ? No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the people who are instructing or leading you . Are they certified or educated in exercise science and/or nutrition ? Ask for proof of an exercise/nutrition degree ( bachelor 's or master 's degrees in science or arts , registered dietitian ) and/or trainer certification ( including CPR ) such as ACE , NSCA , ACSM and NASM . If they ca n't provide these , keep shopping . If they make fun of the need for certification , of if their trainers are certified " in house , " do n't buy it .  --  What to look for in a trainer <p> 1 . Check credentials . A trainer with some legitimate higher education and certification from a nationally recognized and accredited organization is a safer choice than someone who attended " Wassamatta U " and is certified by Barbie and Ken 's Personal Trainer Studio . Military training or body building titles are no guarantees that they are expert trainers . <p> 2 . Read up on the available trainers . Most gyms have files on their trainers that include a complete biography of their education , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watch and learn . If possible , observe the trainers as they work with their clients . You will be able to tell if their style and personality fits yours in very short order , as well as observe how attentive and responsive they are to their clients ' needs .
