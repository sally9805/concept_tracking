Twenty million Americans walk around with high-tech medical gear grinding away inside them . Are they safe ? <p> Johnson &; Johnson 's drug-coated stent is a miracle of medical engineering . The tiny , stainless-steel mesh tube , less than 4 millimeters wide , relieves the crushing chest pain that occurs when the heart is starved of blood . Covered in a chemical that keeps the artery from closing , the stent slides into a blocked vessel in a simple , not very invasive procedure and stays there , propping it open . After it hit the market in April 2003 , cardiologists implanted the new stent in 350,000 people in eleven months , though it costs nearly three times as much as older , noncoated versions . <p> Since then drug-coated stents from J &J; and Boston Scientific have been inserted into the arteries of 4 million people . The breakthrough medical devices generate $5 billion a year in sales from a million patients . You might figure that , being federally regulated , these devices were approved only after the manufacturers established both their safety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point . It turns out that the teensy tubular scaffolds have never been shown to prevent heart attacks or save lives ; their human trials were smaller , of shorter duration and more narrowly focused than trials for many new drugs ; and half of all applications involve " off-label " uses , deploying stents in ways that were n't studied at all in clinical testing . <p> Now new data indicate that the stents , because of their supposedly miraculous coating , may cause 4,500 heart attacks every year , up to 2,000 of them fatal . This increased risk , moreover , could persist for a lifetime , requiring patients to take blood thinners for the rest of their lives , thereby facing the sometimes fatal side effects of those drugs . <p> " There 's so much evidence " of the new danger , says Spencer King , the Piedmont Hospital cardiologist who in 1987 implanted the first stent in North America . He says up to 30% of patients who get drug-coated stents would fare better with bare metal , avoiding extra heart attack risk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " Everybody agrees this is real , " he says . <p> But Johnson &; Johnson insists it sees no significantly increased risk . Boston Scientific says the worries are overblown . It and many researchers say the drug-coated stents ' ability to vastly reduce reclogging outweighs the risks . Next month the two gadget giants will have to defend their thriving business before an expert panel advising the Food &; Drug Administration on the issue . Whatever the outcome , can plaintiff lawyers be far behind ? <p> The flap over stents is the latest in a series of safety scares now racking the booming , $80 billion-a-year business of medical devices . Some 20 million Americans now walk around embedded with high-tech gear : artificial hips and knee joints , pacemakers , heart defibrillators and more . Most of the 80,000 gadgets in use  --  and most of the 4,000 new ones okayed every year  --  are safe and effective . <p> But 79 devices have been yanked off the market in the past five years because of potentially fatal side effects , up 65% over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for lesser complications . And when a recall happens , often the suspect device remains inside patients . <p> Implantable defibrillators , which deliver a shock to the heart to prevent it from shutting down , have been surgically implanted into hundreds of thousands of patients in recent years . Then in 2005 defib maker Guidant told doctors about a design flaw that could render two of its models ineffective  --  three years after it first spotted the problem . Some of the 40,000 patients with these models underwent surgery to replace them , while others wait for what might go wrong . The manufacturer , now owned by Boston Scientific , faces 550 individual or class suits . Cardiologists say that the number of malfunctions is small compared with the number of lives saved . <p> Guidant also took a hit in 2003 over its Ancure aortic stent . Approved in 1999 after trials involving 621 patients , it was created to thwart aortic aneurism , a weak spot in the main artery from the heart . ( If the aneurism bursts , the patient could die . ) Guidant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessels during installation . But instead of reporting all of the problems to the FDA , as required , the company initially kept it quiet . In two years the new stent went into some 7,600 patients  --  and malfunctions occurred in more than 2,600 of the cases , leading to 12 patient deaths , the Justice Department says . After seven whistleblowers alerted the feds , Guidant pleaded guilty to ten felonies , paid a $92 million fine and shut down the business making the aortic stent . <p> Now some doctors are flagging the potential dangers of new implantable gadgets to treat back pain , prevent stroke and soothe severe heartburn . Some doctors decry J &J's; new metal disc , known as the Charite , which has been implanted in the spines of several thousand patients . It was approved by regulators after a trial involving only 304 patients  --  and only 36% of them fared well enough to get off narcotic painkillers . <p> Neck stents made by Abbott Laboratories are coming into question , too . They can prevent strokes by propping open the carotid artery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vessel cut open in surgery . But in October a 527-patient study sponsored by the French government found that 10% of patients who got neck stents died or had a stroke in the following month  --  double the complication rate for surgery . Abbott says its studies show no added risk , and one supporter , German cardiologist Klaus Mathias , says the French study was the most poorly run clinical trial he had ever seen . Abbott is conducting trials in 4,000 patients to settle the matter . <p> Another much-debated fix : tiny clumps of polymer lodged in the esophagus to quell heartburn . Boston Scientific 's Enteryx spurts a polymer into the throat to alleviate pain . It was approved in 2003 after being tested in FDA trials in a mere 109 patients over 12 months . ( By comparison , 11,000 patients took Wyeth 's ulcer pill , Protonix , for the same amount of time in order to get the drug approved . ) <p> But the plastic-dispensing device was difficult to use properly . Sometimes doctors delivered the polymer to the wrong place , causing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death when the chemical was injected into the aorta instead of the esophagus . The company voluntarily pulled the device in 2005 . <p> Several competing heartburn gadgets remain on the market , despite limited testing . " These things were rushed to market too early , without being tested enough , " contends gastroenterologist Walter Hogan at the Medical College of Wisconsin , who calls for a moratorium on their use until better studies are done . <p> More safety questions may arise with increasing frequency . Hundreds of clinical trials are under way for still more miracle gadgets : new devices to treat depression by using magnetic fields applied to the skull ; replacement parts for bad heart valves ; a mesh bag that is wrapped around the heart to help counteract heart failure . <p> Some doctors , academics and patient advocates blame the lapses on a medical-industrial complex made up of acquiescent regulators , gadget-happy cardiologists and surgeons who rake in consulting and appearance fees from device makers , and pushy device makers themselves . These critics cite an overly lax regulatory process , trials that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of follow-up after treatment . <p> Some devices " have n't been as safe as they should be , " says David Waters , a cardiologist at the University of California , San Francisco . " It 's just easier for something that does n't work well to slip by . " Charles Rosen , a spinal surgeon and safety crusader at UC , Irvine , adds : " The FDA is n't meeting its responsibility to ensure the safety and efficacy of devices for the American public . Regulators are manipulated by industry . " Says Eric Sacks of Emergency Care Research Institute , a nonprofit that tracks recall data : " The system is overwhelmed . " <p> The FDA admits as much , acknowledging " inadequacies " and " shortcomings " in tracking device safety and vowing to overhaul its approach . " I do n't see this as a bad thing  --  I see it as good , " says James Tobin , chief of Boston Scientific , of efforts to more thoroughly test devices . The device industry trade group , AdvaMed , says the FDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helping it " streamline and refine postmarket reporting mechanisms . " <p> That is an elusive quest , given the swelling ranks of gadget patients . Each year half a million people in the U.S. undergo spinal-fusion surgery , says research firm Frost &; Sullivan . They get cages , screws and rods implanted in the spine , despite studies that show fusion is not very effective for lower back pain . A total of 160,000 Americans get artificial hips made of titanium and plastic ; 280,000 get knee replacements ; a quarter-million get defibs . Only one **25;3108;TOOLONG patient in five ends up needing a jolt to the heart . To be sure , you do n't know in advance which patients will need this life-saving jolt . <p> This thriving trade in man-made body parts has enriched shareholders of device makers : An index of 11 such stocks is up 43% in four years , while a drugmaker index has fallen 2% , hurt by the Vioxx safety scandal and other travails . The gadget craze has created several fortunes , making billionaires of William Cook of Cook Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and John Abele , cofounder of Boston Scientific . <p> The device boom also has fattened the wallets of thousands of physicians . The advent of angioplasty created a new breed : the interventional cardiologist  --  14,000 of them . Elsewhere 3,500 doctors specialize in implanting parts for aching backs . <p> The symbiosis between docs and device makers concerns some experts . " Physicians like to do things that work , that make money and promote their specialty , " says Frank Veith , a vascular surgeon at New York University Medical Center who is critical of newfangled neck stents . <p> The industry 's ties to docs are so cozy that at a recent conference on " Trans-catheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics , " in Washington , D.C. , the hosts put out a booklet disclosing conflicts of interest . It ran on for 45 pages . Many researchers disclosed having accepted thousands of dollars in research grants and consulting and speaker fees . The organizer , cardiologist Gregg Stone of Columbia University , revealed that 12 companies had each paid him $10,000 or more and that he had taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ industry leads to advances that help patients . <p> UC , Irvine 's Charles Rosen argues that scores of spine surgeons " have basically become marketing men for these companies and earn huge consulting fees . " <p> " It is a rigged system , " Rosen laments . He has formed the Association of Ethical Spine Surgeons for physicians who are free of such conflicts ; 50 have signed up . <p> Now the feds are stepping in . Medtronic in July agreed to pay $40 million in fines to settle civil allegations that its spinal-devices unit paid kickbacks to doctors in the form of sham consulting agreements , shady royalty pacts and lavish trips ; though the company paid up , it denies any wrongdoing . <p> Some patients feel betrayed . Catherine Rich , 40 , of Mission Viejo , Calif. , endured debilitating back pain for three months before following her surgeon 's advice to let him embed her spine with an $11,500 disc from J &J.; " It was presented like it was going to solve all my problems . I was going to be this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned , worse than ever  --  she could n't go to work , care for her 4-year-old son or have sex with her husband . <p> So Rich had to undergo a second surgery , this one performed by Dr. Rosen . He argues that J &J's; Charite disc increased her pain , but he left it in place and fused together two vertebrae . Rich says she still ca n't climb stairs easily and spends 23 hours a day in a special hospital bed . " It ruined my life . " So far she has n't sued  --  but at least 30 other disc recipients have . <p> Rosen believes hundreds more patients have been hurt by the new disc , which has been implanted in several thousand people . ( He has done some limited work reviewing cases for plaintiff lawyers . ) Rosen contends J &J's; trial compared Charite with an outmoded surgery to make the metal disc look more effective . <p> J &J; denies the trial was rigged and insists the Charite disc has a low complication rate and that it lets patients recover faster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 688 patients it studied needed repeat operations . Texas Back Institute spine surgeon Richard Guyer concurs , citing results in more than 300 patients at his clinic . The vast majority " are very happy , " says Guyer , who receives consulting fees from J &J.; <p> Making myriad metal parts for ailing spines now is a $2.3 billion-a-year business , Frost &; Sullivan says , growing 25% a year . The number of lumbar fusions , to name one procedure , tripled from 1990 to 2001 , reaching 120,000 that year . " Most spine devices are of uncertain efficacy and probably add to the complication rate , " says internist Richard Deyo at the University of Washington . He studied spinal-fusion surgeries in Washington State and found that as procedures soared from 1990 to 2000 , the rate of repeat surgeries rose a bit ; it would have fallen had the devices worked well . <p> But critics who assert there is no data supporting back surgery are " flat-out wrong , " says spine surgeon John Peloza of Dallas . " Surgery is expanding because the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no progress would be made if device makers and doctors did n't work closely together . Spine device maker Medtronic says back surgery " has proven results . " <p> The booming industry 's humble beginnings go back a century . In 1886 J &J; opened up shop in New Brunswick , N.J. on the fourth floor of a former wallpaper factory ; 14 employees made sterile surgical dressings . In the late 1950s and early 1960s came the first artificial hips , developed by British surgeons , and then the first artificial heart valves . The first pacemaker that could be implanted in patients came about the same time , from a then tiny firm called Medtronic . <p> The modern device era exploded in 1977 with the invention of angioplasty , when German cardiologist Andreas Gruentzig made a tiny slice near the hip of a patient and inserted a catheter tipped with a balloon into an artery . He snaked it up into the heart , inflating the balloon to squish a clump of plaque against the artery 's inner wall to clear it . <p> The new procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Around the same time the implantable defibrillator was invented , building Medtronic and St. Jude Medical . Angioplasty , defibs and orthopedics are now mainstays of the device industry . <p> The industry was barely regulated until 1976 , when Congress empowered the FDA to ensure devices were safe , effective and well made . But the new law included a loophole called 510(k) that remains today : A device can be approved with few or no clinical trials if it is deemed " substantially equivalent " to a gadget that existed before 1976 . <p> Most of the thousands of devices in use today were cleared under this easy passage , even frightfully intrusive new tools . In 2004 Concentric Medical of Mountain View , Calif. unveiled one of the first devices to treat stroke , a kind of corkscrew for the brain . It is fed from a slit in the groin into the neck to clear out the vessel and then is removed . It was approved via 510(k) because it was similar to older devices . <p> But some neurologists say it has not yet been proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drugs with better data were turned down . " It is very frustrating . Approving this device has made it difficult to find out how well it works , " says University of Pittsburgh neurologist Lawrence R. Wechsler . Concentric counters that it now is running a federally funded trial of 120 patients . <p> Another device , the Aquadex FlexFlow from CHF Solutions of Brooklyn Park , Minn. , is used as an alternative to drugs to drain excess fluid from patients with congestive heart failure . The Aquadex sits outside the body like an intravenous bag , cycling healthy blood back into the patient . It cleared the FDA on a 510(k) exception in 2002 . By contrast , a J &J; drug to treat the same problem endured 14 clinical trials covering more than 1,500 patients  --  and still drew fire for safety questions . CHF has new results from a 200-patient study that seem to show the FlexFlow , which costs $14,500 , has some advantage over drugs  --  four years after it went on the market . <p> The FDA looked at tightening device rules in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To be sure , it is possible for regulators to go too far in regulating implants . In 1992 the agency called a moratorium on silicone breast implants , playing into the hands of tort lawyers making an industry of suing silicone implant maker Dow Corning . After the company was bankrupted by the litigation it became apparent that there was scarcely any scientifically established link between silicone and the health problems blamed on it . Dow Corning is now out of bankruptcy . Breast implants may return to the market by next year . <p> In 1993 a high-ranking FDA official , Robert Temple , issued a report on how the burgeoning device industry could conduct more rigorous clinical trials . That faded in 1997 when Congress passed a law dictating that new devices must be approved by the " least burdensome " method possible . <p> By that time the industry had gotten a big boost with the first metal stent for clogged arteries . Doctors were doing 300,000 balloon angioplasties annually in the U.S. , but in upward of 40% of cases the artery reclogged ( a process @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ &J; in 1994 introduced the first stent to prop the artery open ; this cut restenosis to 15% of cases . Angioplasties soared to 800,000 a year by 2002 . Then came J &J's; drug-coated stent , which reduced the reclogging problem to fewer than 5% of patients , and angios increased to more than a million a year . <p> The new stent , the Cypher , was tested on 1,058 patients in its biggest trial ; a heart-drug study might require three times as many subjects . The tiny tube was coated in a rubbery polymer that released bits of medicine over time , preventing the artery from growing scar tissue over the device and reclogging the blood flow . But that left the polymer and metal exposed , and in rare cases blood clots form on this foreign surface and cause heart attacks . <p> Patients with drug-coated stents get clots at the rate of 1 per 500 patients per year , to judge from outside analyses of the company 's trial results . J &J; and Boston Scientific will be running trials of tens of thousands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be available for years . <p> Many doctors argue that the FDA should toughen its standards for introducing new implants of all kinds . But doing so might slow innovation in a breakthrough-fueled industry . " The device industry would grind to a halt " if studies for implants became as big as those for drugs , says Mitchell Krucoff of the Duke Clinical Research Institute . Thomas Fogarty , a professor at Stanford who has patents on 63 devices , says young doctors are reluctant to invent new devices because of the regulatory scrutiny they already face . " We in the U.S. are slowing down and losing our position of leadership , " he frets . <p> Daniel Schultz , the FDA 's chief device regulator , says new medical devices do n't need the large-scale exhaustive trials of the drug industry because it is easier to predict the behavior of a machine than it is to track the chemical interactions of a new drug in the body . But he vows to pursue sweeping changes in how the FDA monitors device performance after approval , creating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far faster than today 's paperwork reporting process can . <p> " We are talking about fundamental changes , " Schultz says . He emphasizes that the benefits of medical devices " far outweigh any risk . " The hard part : sifting out the few flawed devices that emerge in this surging business of bionic parts  --  and stopping them from posing hidden threats to millions of patients . Innovation Engine <p> The $80 billion-a-year medical device industry depends on a steady flow of new gadgets to treat a wide range of physical ailments . Here 's a list of inventions working their way through the pipeline .

An ICD prevents sudden cardiac death by sensing abnormal heart rhythms and shocking the heart back into action with a jolt of electricity . Recalls have scared patients , but experts and the companies point out that more people have died from not getting defibrillators than from having them fail . HIP AND KNEE REPLACEMENT <p> Every year joints made of titanium and plastic replace 160,000 American hips and 280,000 knees . Most of these devices are manufactured by Biomet , Stryker , Zimmer and J &J.; They are safe and effective , but a controversy may be brewing over price : Because one hospital does n't know what others are paying , prices may vary as much as $1,000 , or 20% , inflating health care costs , according to Bernstein Research . CAROTID STENTS <p> These devices , made by Abbott , Boston Scientific and J &J,; were invented as an alternative to vascular surgery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say the older technique may be better ; fans of the new gadgets say these trials were flawed . VAGUS NERVE STIMULATORS <p> Cyberonics ' vagus nerve stimulator has been approved to treat severe and chronic depression , which can lead to suicide . Some experts argued that there is n't enough data to prove the device effective . Cyberonics says more than 1,800 patients with depression have already been treated with it . HEART STENTS <p> A million Americans get these metal mesh tubes implanted every year . The devices keep the arteries that feed the heart from closing again after they are opened in a procedure called balloon angioplasty . Newer drug-coated versions do a better job of holding the artery open , but some critics say they may cause dangerous clots in rare cases .
