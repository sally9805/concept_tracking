Chapter One I It was right around midnight and bodies were heating up at the G-Spot . I should have been at home studying for a chemistry test but instead I was sitting with my girl Brittany in a private booth at the most expensive gentleman 's club in Harlem . " This place is the shit , Juicy . " The music was loud and Brittany was dancing in her seat . " Your man is large , " Brittany said . " Old as dirt , but large . If Cecil owned a fly joint like this instead of a detail shop , I 'd be hanging lovely every night . I ca n't believe they charge a grand just to get in the door , but with all these rich-ass basketball players and rap artists up in here I guess cheddar ai n't nothing but cheese . " Saturday night was Ladies Night at the G-Spot Social Club . Although the lap dances and private parties catered to the men , one night a week sisters came out to drool over some of the sexiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady running her mouth . She was in my finance class at Fordham University , and I had invited her down to the Spot because I liked having company . " Juice , " she said , " this place is not only classy , but it 's also hot ! Thanks for getting me in for free , but damn , girl , when are the brothers coming out ? " " Hold on , " I told her . " The male strippers are coming up next . " And that 's when my trouble will really begin , I thought , crossing my legs . " Do n't get me wrong , " Brittany said . Dressed in a short white skirt and a silk halter , she was drinking double shots of Alize and had three lines of coke laid out on the table in front of her . " I mean , the girls are working it , but where are the men with the fine bodies ? I want to see some hardasses and Mandingo backs . Maybe even get me some dill-zick , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I looked around for G and saw him walking up the stairs like he did every night at this time . G was a man of habit . I could put my money on it that every night at exactly midnight , he would disappear upstairs to check on his drug operation and make sure each nanogram of his powder was accounted for . The house rule was to get the men to spend every dime in their pockets , and every girl had to do her part . It was about getting them to buy drinks all night , pay for lap dances ; and if they wanted to fuck , they paid for the sex and the room , too . And Brittany was right . Money was n't a big thing for the drug dealers and playas , but I could see how it would turn her on . The dollars had my nose open at first too , but not anymore . These days chasing the thing that I wanted most could get me killed . It was like being addicted to candy and working in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Night after night I sat in the G-Spot , the biggest sex den in New York City , and watched others get what I needed . Let me just put it out there . I was a nineteen-year-old Harlem girl with a healthy appetite . But it was n't sweets that I craved . And it was n't drugs . It was n't jewelry , and it was n't Prada skirts or fur coats neither . All that stuff was at my fingertips , mine for the taking . I was miserable in spite of all the bling . Because even though I rolled with the richest man in Harlem , I could n't get my g-spot hit . I was Granite McKay 's woman , and I craved dick . I guess you could say G inherited me from my grandmother , who had been good friends with him and his mother . Even though he was twenty-seven years older than me , I had known him all my life . When I was a kid we lived on 136th Street in Harlem , and I used to run numbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the block played , and I never forgot a bet . Grandmother was sanctified but she played her some numbers every day . I would run up to the number house and put the numbers in , then keep track of who hit without ever writing any of it down . Every afternoon when whoever hit got paid , my grandmother got her cut and me and my younger brother Jimmy got a Nehi grape soda , a pack of watermelon Now &; Laters , and some rainbow jawbreakers . G owned the number spot and a lot of other businesses in Harlem , too . He had been married to a Puerto Rican woman at one time , but people said she disappeared one day and nobody ever went looking for her . G had a son named Gino , but nobody had seen him in years . He went to college in another state because G wanted him to live a different type of life . By the time I was fifteen I was looking at Granite McKay with grown-woman eyes because he had a body that was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rumors about older men like him . Old men give you worms . Old cum turns into buttermilk . Old balls sag and have gray hairs on them . I did n't listen to none of that shit because I did n't think it applied to the way G was laying it down . Young or old , he was the finest man I 'd ever seen in my life . G was tall and had dark skin and hair that was real black and wavy . Every six months he was driving a spanking new car . People on the street worshiped him and treated him like the king of Harlem . But one day me and Jimmy and Grandmother watched from our window as G beat a man down on a street corner . The man was bleeding and begging for his life , and G held him down and bent his fingers back one at a time . All ten of them . I could feel his bones crack . A cop car drove up and when the patrolmen inside saw that it was G administering the ass-whipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked Grandmother what the man could have done that was so bad , she told me he was G 's cousin , and that he 'd cheated G out of twenty dollars on a bet . I could n't understand it because G was so rich . He owned all the drug dealers in Harlem . He owned the number spots and restaurants and clubs . Twenty dollars was nothing to a man like him . But Grandmother said it was the betrayal and not the money that almost got the man killed . She said G had killed other people for less than that and the only reason G did n't kill this man because they were family and had grown up together and G loved him . I saw the man not too long after that on Malcolm X Boulevard and both of his hands were in a cast . One of his eyeballs was gone out the socket and he had no front teeth . Grandmother said G let his cousin live as a lesson to everybody walking the streets of Harlem : Nobody betrayed G and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dranky dranks are free ? " Brittany picked up her glass and guzzled her drink down . She sniffed a line from the table and then offered me some . I shook my head . My mother had been a junkie ho so I never used drugs . The crowd started clapping and Brittany pointed up at the stage . Her mouth fell open as the spotlight shone on a sister who was squatting with her back to the crowd . The girl was named Honey Dew , and dollars was being thrown up on the stage like mad . Honey Dew bent over and spread her butt cheeks and picked up a full bottle of Coke using just the muscles in her pussy . " Oooh ! Did you see that ! " Brittany and everybody else was going crazy . " I got ta learn that move ! " " I do n't know if she 's giving lessons , but drink all you want . " I turned away from the scene on the stage . " Go on , Britt . Order another round . Whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could say the same thing about myself . I could n't get what I wanted if I tried . None of the men in Harlem were crazy enough to touch me . G would never cheat on me , and he played me so close I could n't cheat on him either . He allowed me go to college three days a week , but that was only to keep me from getting bored .
