<p> Karen Phelan remembers how scared she was when she bought her first home 10 years ago . Newly divorced and broke , she 'd saved for a year for a down payment on a modest house . <p> " I just got tired of waiting for Mr. Right to come along and start the American dream , " says Phelan , who owns her own company , which resells time-shares . Last year , she sold that house and bought a larger one in a gated golf-course community in Reno . <p> " They 're kind of like emotional trophies , " says Phelan , 43 . " It 's symbolic of success  --  of getting out there and doing it on my own and saying , ' I 'm just as capable of doing it as the next person and doing it on my own and making it . ' " <p> A lot of other women seem to feel the same way . Last year , single women snapped up one of every five homes sold . That 's nearly 1.5 million , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men bought , according to the National Association of Realtors . <p> The trend is striking , because in 1981 , the number of single women and single men home buyers was virtually the same . Since then , the percentage of buyers who are single women has almost doubled , while the percentage of single men buyers slipped 1 percentage point to 9% last year . <p> This rise of single-women homeowners is part of a greater social and economic shift that is reshaping American life . <p> " For the first time in history , women have access to the same resources men have always had  --  money , social status , power , " says Donald Hantula , professor of organizational psychology at Temple University in Philadelphia . <p> " Women can go and acquire them on their own rather than searching for a mate to provide them . These demographic and social changes are not in line with how we adapted in the hunter-gatherer era . " <p> This trend is forcing changes in real estate . The building industry is beginning to add features to homes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help women qualify for loans . <p> " There have been so many advances and innovations in the market to respond to them , " says Regina Lowrie , chairman of the Mortgage Bankers Association and the first woman to hold that post . <p> Some of the most critical demographic changes that have opened up the real estate market to women include : <p> *Women ( and men ) are marrying later . On average , women now wait until they 're nearly 26 to walk down the aisle , about six years later than in 1960 , according to Census data . On average , men today marry at age 27 , an increase of five years in that same period . <p> *Divorce . A Census study showed that 73% of women who married between 1980 and 1984 reached their 10th anniversary , compared with 90% of women who married between 1945 and 1949 . Still , as many as half of new marriages end in divorce . <p> *Women tend to live longer than men . The average man will die at 74 , giving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more years to buy a home on her own . <p> " The large pool of unmarried individuals reduces the social weight of marriage , in economics and politics , " says Stephanie Coontz , professor of history and family studies at Evergreen State College in Olympia , Wash . " It creates tastes , habits and expectations , as well as voting blocs not tied to the role of wife or husband . " <p> Unmarried women have more money than ever . <p> In part , <p> that 's because more women than men are going to college . Men have been the minority on college campuses since the 1970s , and they now make up just 44% of the student body . There are more women than ever on the job  --  46% of the workforce  --  and the pay gap with men is closing . <p> The rush of single women to buy homes is impressive , coming after decades of sex discrimination by banks and real estate agents . <p> Before 1974 , when Congress amended the Fair Housing Act to stop sex discrimination , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even a credit card , in their own names . <p> If a woman was married , her income was usually discounted on a loan application , Coontz recalls , because the bank assumed she would stop working once she had children . <p> Those days are gone . Today , mortgage companies offer products to help low-income applicants qualify for loans . <p> Single moms and homes <p> Women , in particular , benefit because 25% of single mothers spend more than half their income on housing , compared with 10% of single fathers who do , according to the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard University . <p> When Patty Tarling became a single parent , she was 20 . She then struggled for 15 years before she could buy her first home in Hillsboro , Ore . Borrowing against her 401(k) retirement plan , she put down 3% of the home price and received a loan insured by the Federal Housing Administration . <p> Last year , Tarling sold that home and moved to a suburb of Sacramento , where she 's an office manager for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house . <p> " I did 100% financing , because the security of having a big cushion in savings and other investments is huge for me after living paycheck to paycheck for most of my life , " says Tarling , now 40 . <p> Owning a home " is the biggest accomplishment I 've had  --  I 'm just elated by it . Aside from your child , just the sense of confidence and self-worth you have to say you own your home is just huge . " <p> Tarling concedes it 's a little intimidating for her boyfriend , who was displaced by Hurricane Katrina and now lives with her . <p> " It 's just a step , " she says . " If we get married or something , we 'll buy a place together . " <p> Because of new government loan criteria , many lenders will now help single women in several ways . They will : <p> *Let women count child support from an ex-husband as income to help qualify for loans . <p> *Consider divorced women as first-time buyers , <p> even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women can qualify for further help . First-time home buyers can often receive down-payment assistance or low-down-payment loans . <p> *Let women use some alternative forms of credit history , such as their phone bill record , in case they never had credit in their own names , says Lowrie of the Mortgage Bankers Association . <p> Single women home buyers often need help because their median income is $47,315 a year  --  20% less than for single men buyers . <p> Buying the first condo <p> Sarah Van Elderen , 23 , who graduated last year from Grand Valley State University in Allendale , Mich. , does n't make that much money . Still , she bought her first condo in Grand Rapids , Mich. , with a fixed-rate , no-down payment loan for first-time home buyers . <p> ( No-money-down loans can be risky if home prices in the area decline , and the owner needs to sell . ) <p> She 's proud of her first condo , even though she says , " The reaction of my 94-year-old grandma was , ' You 're going to end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> Actually , the rising number of single women homeowners could change the dating scene completely , says Hantula of Temple University . <p> " Houses are a great source of wealth , and as women are buying and holding onto them , they will gain greater equity and become less dependent on male partners for material assets and protection , " Hantula says . <p> " Over the long term , women will become pickier , more choosy . They will look beyond an asset-based mating decision . ... Characteristics like emotional stability and other kinds of compatibility will become more important . " <p> Apparently , home builders also want to be more attractive to single women buyers now . They 're designing homes with features preferred by women . <p> " Women want more security than men , and less maintenance , " says Anthony Perry , co-owner of Oakwood Homes , a developer in Woodstock , Ga . <p> " It 's just does n't matter to men as much . We 're putting in flat-screen TVs for the guys . " <p> Among the amenities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that provides a stronger sense of security , gated communities and twice as many street lights . <p> He also adds larger closets and energy-efficient appliances , which he thinks matter more to women . He also provides maintenance services for his home buyers . " We water outside the courtyard , mow the grass out front  --  we even change the heating and cooling filters , " he says . <p> Asked why he thinks so few single men buy homes , Perry replies : " Men do it when we get married . Until then , we 're just out running around . " <p> Tommie Livatino , a high school basketball coach in Chicago , is one of the rare single-male home buyers . <p> " Every time I bought a piece of property , I always saw it as an investment first , and a way to keep living with my friends , " says Livatino , 36 . <p> He rented out rooms to his friends in his first house and bought his second and third homes with friends . Why does he think more single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women are much more intelligent than men , " he says . <p> A professor 's theory <p> Historically , men have always had access to the resources to provide shelter and do n't have the same imperative , says Hantula , the organizational psychology professor . <p> " Throughout our evolutionary history , access to shelter was more the province of men than women . You take the hunter and gatherer into the 21st century , and men say , ' I do n't need to go buy shelter , because if I need it , I can get it . ' Whereas the woman is saying , ' If I have the chance , I better get it while I can . ' " <p> Pat Spalding , 54 , who is single and lives in Lakeland , Fla. , sold her home and bought a nicer one last year . She recalls how a single male colleague had a very different reaction to buying a home . <p> " He needed to buy a home for the tax shelter , but he said , ' If I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have something to sell , ' " recalls Spalding , who works in the real estate division of Central Florida Gas . <p> " But I need the security . I own this . ... And I do n't want to depend on anyone for anything , and men do n't seem to care about that . " <p> The trend toward single women home buyers might be socially unsettling in the short term , Hantula notes . <p> And for women home buyers  --  who are doing something that their mothers had to fight to do  --  purchasing their first home can be personally unsettling , too . <p> " The first experience was really scary for me , " Phelan says . <p> " I 'm not going to candy-coat it . I do n't think any woman out there is going to tell you the first purchase going solo is easy , because it 's a huge investment .
