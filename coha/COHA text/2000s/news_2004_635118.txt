<p> Yesterday I heard for the first time that " Ripley 's Game , " released in Europe , would not make the big screens in the U.S. and has gone right to DVD . I bought it yesterday , watched the film last night  --  and loved it ! Great story , great acting , great locations and photography . What 's the problem with distribution in the U.S. ? <p> Fred Bothwell , <p> Austin , Texas <p> " Ripley 's Game " centers on a John Malkovich performance that creates the best of all the Tom Ripleys in the movies . It is a superb film , and on " Ebert &; Roeper " we gave it a full review , even though it went directly to DVD . The failure to open it theatrically was a shameful blunder by New Line and Fine Line , comparable to Miramax 's failure to release " The Castle , " the funniest comedy of recent years . <p> Q. I have recently watched both " Elephant " and " Gerry , " by Gus Van Sant . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a video game that shows two characters being shot in what looks to be a desert . They 're wearing clothes that look exactly the same as the characters in " Gerry . " Are these two films meant to be related ? <p> Kevin Ellis , Portland , Ore . <p> A. Gus Van Sant tells me : " The films are related in that they are two different lessons or thoughts about delusional killing  --  and I am working on one more . The first , " Gerry , " is killing by the hand of one 's trusted friend . The second , " Elephant , " is by the hand of an unknown or foreign entity . And the third one , " Last Days , " will be death by one 's own hand . But I guess one of the real reasons to base the video game characters on " Gerry " is that we could n't secure a real game , say " Doom , " for instance , from a video game company . So we made a simple , somewhat low-budget game @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , except in the themes of delusional death . " <p> Q. In your " Hellboy " review , you wondered how the heroes went from defeating the monsters in one cave , to being imprisoned in another . Well , for one , Liz explained that she blacks out when she uses her powers . I guess that we can just assume that John was knocked unconscious by the force of the blast . And given that Hellboy did n't appear to be moving or awake when Liz fried the monsters , the bad guys only had to pick them up and transport them . <p> Neil Shyminsky , <p> Toronto , Ontario <p> A. Ingenious , but there 's another explanation . Matthew Bradford of Los Angeles points me to a message by director Guillermo del Toro on the message board of the official " Hellboy " Web site . <p> Edited for length , del Toro writes : " We got some complaints of HB copies that were screening without 45 seconds at the end of reel 5 . You see , AFTER Liz explodes there is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taking it as a cue for the reel being over . It is not ! All copies are printed correctly but may be screened with that 45 seconds missing by omission in the ' assembly ' of the platter . The print you view needs to have the following scenes : <p> A ) HB is attacked ( spoilers from now on ) . Liz explodes . A rock hits the lens ! <p> B ) DARKNESS . Voices . The water has evaporated , and burnt Sammael carcasses are seen . Myers wakes up , dizzy . He sees Rasputin/Ilsa . She approaches him and thanks him for the grenade belts . CUT TO : <p> C ) Another space in the complex . She 's slamming the belts and everybody has been manacled . <p> The copies are being projected without " B " in some theaters . " <p> Q. I know you 've stated in the past that your reviews should n't be evaluated in comparison to the general consensus , but when you see a wide disparity between your reaction to a film and that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving a good-to-stellar review to something that everyone thinks stunk , do you ever second guess yourself ? For example with these recent films : " Ella Enchanted , " " The Alamo , " " Jersey Girl , " " Never Die Alone , " " Taking Lives , " " Secret Window , " " Spartan , " " The Reckoning " and " Hidalgo . " <p> Sandy Cormack , <p> Baltimore , Md . <p> A. I remain satisfied with all of those reviews . I try to explain the reasons why I praise or dislike a movie , and I think , for example , that my review of " Hidalgo " is a splendid description of the film I saw and the reasons I liked it . Mamet 's " Spartan " is likely to make my Top 10 list . " Jersey Girl " suffered because of the Affleck-J . Lo nonsense and because Kevin Smith dared to make a sweet film . <p> You did n't ask , but I was stunned that " The Girl Next Door " scored around 60 on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Los Angeles Times : " What is disturbing and frankly distasteful about ' The Girl Next Door ' is how slick and shameless it is in its eagerness to blur boundaries , to squeeze as much transgressive material as it can into a nominally bland and innocent form . " The movie 's ads are shamelessly pitched at an audience too young to qualify for the R rating . <p> Q. Re the Answer Man items on how people loved " Lost in Translation " in theaters and hated it on video . After being in the video industry for 20 years , I 've noticed that nothing affects a person 's view more than expectations . With " Lost in Translation , " I saw a screener on video months before its release and loved the movie . By the time it was released on video , it had gone through the media hype of the Academy Awards , and viewers were expecting heights that could not be reached . Everyone had heard what a great movie it was , and the virgin experience that reviewers got was lost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came out ; most video customers were very vocal in their dislike of it . It was one of the first video titles to go through a media frenzy , and like " Lost in Translation , " nothing could live up to the hype . Since then it has , of course , moved on to become a video classic . <p> Brad Pilger , <p> Edmonton , Alberta <p> A. The movie 's reception on video has inspired a record number of messages to the Answer Man . Bob Riggs of Houston writes : " Some films are intended to be appealing and easily digested , while others try to explore difficult subjects in unique ways . By nature , humans enjoy simple repetition of pleasant experiences and shy away from the hard work involved with dealing with anything challenging . <p> " Thomas Kinkade and Britney Spears have made enormous amounts of money marketing to people for whom this instinct has become a way of life . I would suggest that the value of ' Lost in Translation ' lies in its appeal to another part of human @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your butt and find out what 's going on out there ! ' " <p> And J.C . Inglis of Toronto writes : " Why did you give in to the clods who disagreed with your statements on ' Lost in Translation ' ? At the end of your reply you wrote , ' You 're not wrong just because you disagree with me . ' Yes , they ARE wrong . Watching , enjoying and understanding movies is a skill and can be done poorly and wrongly . ' Getting ' a movie is not the same as having an emotional response . <p> " One can still ' get ' a movie even if one does n't like it . Saying one does n't ' get ' a movie is like saying one does n't ' get ' a symphony . It proves that one has a stunted or undeveloped faculty of appreciation , or possibly that one is an idiot . " <p> Q. In regard to your " Girl Next Door " review , I do n't think people should try scooping up underpants from the street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Los Angeles <p> A.
