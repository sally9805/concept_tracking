. If you have the time , you can paint your boat yourself . NOTHING GIVES AN OLD BOAT A FACE-LIFT LIKE PAINTING THE HULL . The gel coat on my 1989 23-foot Mako looked old , so I priced a new paint job . Quotes ranged from $8,000 to $10,000 , which convinced me to tackle the job myself . Now I understand why the prices were so high  --  it took me seven days of work over a three-week period . But it proved that if you 're handy , can follow directions and have the time , you can achieve excellent results . WHAT YOU NEED : The project required 4 quarts of Interlux Epoxy Primekote , 3 quarts of Interprotect Epoxy 3000 barrier coat , 4 quarts of Perfection hull paint ( I chose Fighting Lady Yellow ) , 1 gallon of Micron CSC bottom paint , 2 quarts of 202 Fiberglass Solvent Wash , and 2 quarts of 2333N brushing reducer . With brushes , abrasives , etc. , it cost me $900 .

Prep work is 80 percent of the job , so no skimping . Learn to love your orbital sander . You 'll be using it a lot . STEP 1 Pre-Prep : With the boat on blocks I removed the rubrail and everything attached to the hull below it and above the waterline . Thru-hulls in the bottom were left in place because they get painted . The local Soda-Blast Systems guys ( www.sodablast systems.com ) removed the old bottom paint ( see the August issue of " Motor Boating " ) . Then I wetsanded the hullsides and transom using an orbital sander with 120-grit disks to remove the gloss . I wiped them down with 202 solvent and examined the surface for dings , pits and cracks , which I circled with a pencil . STEP 2 Repairs and First Prime : The damaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , each area was sanded and second and third applications were made as needed . Pinholes and blisters below the waterline were similarly repaired . A wipe down with 2333N solvent preceded the first coat of Epoxy Primekote , applied using a solvent-resistant 8 " roller and brushed in tight spots . After drying , the primer was sanded with the orbital using 120-grit , taking it down to the gel coat in places , which revealed more subtle flaws . STEP 3 Small Repairs and Second Prime : Using Evercoat Poly-Flex glazing putty , available at auto body supply stores , I filled fine imperfections quickly , some taking two applications . Each repair was sanded by hand with 220 . A quick wipe down and another application of Primekote followed . This coat was carefully sanded to a thin layer using the orbital and 220-grit . The primer creates a smooth , imperfection-free surface . ( Topcoat paint will highlight , not hide imperfections . ) With the aid of friends , an honest 40 man-hours of prep went into the hull before mixing the first quart of color @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Interlux Perfection polyurethane marine paint with a roller and brush is a two-man operation with one rolling a thin layer of paint onto the hull and the other " tipping " it with a fine , China bristle brush . Tip first in an X pattern , then up and down , and finally horizontally . We worked in small sections starting at the bow and down one side , then the other side , and finally the transom . We applied as little paint as possible to prevent sagging . Start at the bottom and work up with a loaded roller so less is applied at the top of the stroke where gravity can create sags . Additional coats are applied without sanding within 24 to 36 hours . We applied a total of three , and the final coat was touch-dry in eight hours and cured to a hard finish in seven days . STEP 5 Bottoms Up : The paint looked fantastic , even without buffing , but the bottom was still naked . I carefully taped off the waterline and sanded the gloss off the new yellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two days I applied three coats of Interprotect 2000 barrier coat ( see September issue of " Motor Boating " ) and I sanded and primed the trim tabs . When the barrier coat was dry and the bottom and the tabs had two coats of bottom paint ( Micron CSC ) , they were reinstalled with black Quick Drying 5200 sealant , along with all hardware . A new Taco Metals Flexible Vinyl Rubrail was installed according to Taco 's Web site instructions , and I added a black bootstripe to complete the new look and make my 17-year-old Mako shine like new again .
