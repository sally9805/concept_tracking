Phoebe Hawkins was twenty years old , handsome , well-born , and with a fortune of fifty thousand pounds . Here she was , at the start of her second London season , the world at her feet , and yet if there were a more miserable young lady in all of London , she would be surprised . <p> It was mid-morning . Phoebe was standing in the study of her family 's London house , a fine building in Aubrey Square , looking across the desk at her father , Sir Giles Hawkins , with a mixture of despair and hatred . <p> Phoebe had been fast asleep , lost in dreams of present andfuture bliss , when her maid abruptly awakened her , saying thatSir Giles wanted to speak to her at once . And with the quicksensibility of a young woman in love , she knew exactly whyher father had summoned her . Mr. Stanhope must have called , just as he said he would , to ask for her hand in marriage  --  " Asto my heart , you already have it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at this very moment , waiting for her.Phoebe shrugged herself into a morning gown with more speedthan care , and stood , wild with impatience , while Miniver didup the hooks and coaxed a brush through her tangled hair . <p> Phoebe did not for a moment expect her father would raise any objection . To be sure , Arthur Stanhope was some ten years older than she , but that was no kind of an age difference . He was rich , well-bred , and would one day inherit his father 's title . <p> So it was with utter disbelief that she heard her father 's cold and definite words . <p> " There is no possible way that I would give my consent to your marriage to Mr. Stanhope . " Phoebe 's heart missed a beat . She had misheard , this could n't be right . " I do n't understand , " she cried . " Mr. Stanhope wants to marry me , and I wish to be his wife . How can you refuse your consent ? " <p> Sir Giles shook his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry . I expressly forbid it . It is nearly a year until you are of age , but I will not give you any hope that at the end of that period you will be able to marry him . He knows that I am not prepared to give my consent , now or in the future . You may think that when you are one-and-twenty you will be able to marry whom you please . However , should you go against my wishes in this matter , do not expect to take your fortune with you . I have control of that until you are twenty-five . You may say Mr. Stanhope will take you as you are , without a penny to your name . But he knows that at present he can not marry you , and I told him that by the time you attain your majority , you will have forgotten him . " <p> " How can this be ? When did you speak to him ? Has he been to the house this morning ? Why did you not call me sooner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Phoebe put her hand on the corner of her father 's desk , feeling quite dizzy . She could not believe that this was happening to her . How could her father , her kind , affectionate father , be speaking to her in this cold and forceful way ? <p> " Mr. Stanhope called upon me to ask formally for your hand in marriage . I told him , as I am now telling you , that there can be no question of my agreeing to him marrying you . I have asked him not to seek an interview with you , and not to approach you , or talk to you , should you meet at any of the parties and functions which lie ahead . I can not say that he took it in good part , but he is a man with some sense of honour , and when he considers what I had to say , he will see that I am right . " <p> Phoebe pressed her hands to her ears , wanting to shut out her father 's cruel words . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the few brief months until her birthday ? Impossible ! She was in love with him , as he was with her , how could they forget one another ? She tried to explain this to her father , but he brushed her words aside . " It is not for you to decide whether you may or may not accept an offer of marriage . While you must have a preference , an engagement is a matter for your family , for their lawyers , and for the family and lawyers of the man to whom you finally become betrothed . That man is not Mr. Stanhope . " <p> Phoebe 's dismay began to give way to anger . She was a dutiful daughter , and while she was normally on excellent terms with her father , teasing him and joking with him , knowing that he liked her playful ways , she rarely stood up against his authority , mostly because he so rarely exerted it . This was a stranger sitting in front of her , and she could not fathom what had turned him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern , forbidding , and refusing to listen to her . <p> His face softened . " Believe me , Phoebe , I do understand something of your feelings . However , in this case you must allow me , as your father and as a man with a great deal more experience of the world , to know better than you do what is possible , and what is right . And , forgive me , but your attachment to Mr. Stanhope is of such recent standing that you will accept that any parent would be alarmed by talk of engagement . Am I not right in saying that you were unacquainted with Mr. Stanhope previous to your coming to London this time ? " <p> " You know that to be the case , for Mr. Stanhope has been abroad . He is not a friend of our family , and I could not have met him before this year . " <p> " Exactly . And by saying that he is not a friend of the family , you bring me to one of my principal objections to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of who his parents are ? " <p> Phoebe was irritated by this . Yes , she did know that Mr. Stanhope 's parents were Lord and Lady Stanhope . What was remarkable about that ? Her father seemed to expect an answer , so she simply nodded . <p> He continued , " You should also be aware that Lord Stanhope , and indeed Lady Stanhope , are prominent in Whig circles . Now I am not to be suggesting that simply because a man is a member of the opposition , while I am a staunch Conservative , means that any antagonism existing within the Houses of Parliament should be carried into the outside world . Yet there is a grain of truth in the saying , ' Once a Whig , always a Whig . ' And Whiggishness is not simply a matter of how a man votes in the House . It is also a matter of outlook , and going beyond politics , into the realm of morality ; public morality and private morality . I do not personally think we will see another Whig government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and influence carried by the leading families . They have always worked behind the scenes , and by means of marriages and using family connections have exerted a force beyond what is reasonable . " <p> What had this to do with her and Mr. Stanhope ? Whatwas all this talk of Whigs ? She knew that Lord Stanhope did not share her father 's political views , but was that so important ? Certainly , her father had always had a dislike of Whigs , as many Tories did . But this was the nineteenth century , they were not living in the Middle Ages . Was he going to try to pretend that the Hawkins family and the Stanhopes were like the Montagues and Capulets in Shakespeare 's Romeo and Juliet ? <p> " Fustian ! " <p> " No , it is not fustian . You are very young , Phoebe , and do not yet know what makes the world go round . You have had a protected upbringing , I am glad to say , and know no more than is suitable for a well-bred young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intrigue that follow every member of these Whig circles . They make light of the marriage bond ... " <p> His voice faltered and faded away . He had touched on an unmentionable subject , and his eyes dropped as Phoebe looked straight at him . " I do believe I know something about the loosening of marriage bonds , " she said . <p> They looked at one another for a long minute , the unspoken words clear in both their minds , the knowledge of a time when the marriage bonds of Sir Giles and Lady Hawkins had been stretched to breaking point . <p> The long-repressed fury finally spilled out of Phoebe as those words rang in her ears , make light of the marriage bond . " You say that to me ! You who caused Mama so much unhappiness when you set up that woman as your mistress , how dare you criticise other people ? " <p> Sir Giles had risen to his feet , his face thunderous . " That ever I should hear a daughter of mine speak in that way . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> " I sound like a girl who was brought up in a household where her father had a mistress , and her mother  --  " <p> " I forbid you to say it , " said Sir Giles . <p> " Feelings are not to be silenced . And you condemn an entire group of people , not quoting any individual circumstances ; I find it disgraceful , and uncharitable , and in the circumstances inappropriate . " <p> " It is for me to decide what is and what is not appropriate . " <p> They fell silent . Phoebe 's chin was up and she stared at her father with such defiance that he in his turn found it difficult to say anything more . Finally , he banged his fist on to the desk . " Very well , I am sorry it has come to this . You are saying that I have condemned all the Stanhopes , Lord and Lady Stanhope , and therefore by association their son , Mr. Stanhope , merely for being Whigs . This is not so . Your Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affair with a woman called Mrs. Vereker . You look conscious . You know the lady , an uncommonly beautiful woman , an actress of humble origins who managed to ensnare the late Mr. Vereker , and so insinuate herself into society , where by birth , manners , and behaviour she had no place . " <p> " I do not care if Mr. Stanhope has had a mistress . He is a military man , a man of more than thirty . I do not expect to be his first love . " <p> " No , and if I were fool enough to let you marry him , you would most certainly not be his last love . The man is a rake , Mrs. Vereker is simply the latest in a long line of paramours . I dare say she was at the party last night where you were with Mr. Stanhope . When he came this morning , he swore he had fallen in love with you ; I do not consider his words to be worth anything . Were I to give my consent to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him as a bride with a substantial fortune . I can only suppose that with high living he finds himself in financial difficulties and so looks for an heiress to wed . " <p> Tears started into Phoebe 's eyes , but they were tears of rage , not of weakness . Fighting them back , she looked down at the carpet , where the rich Turkish patterns wavered and blurred before her eyes . " You slander him , you have no justification for what you say . " <p> " I speak nothing but the truth . Ask one of your married cousins about Mr. Stanhope 's reputation , about Mrs. Vereker and the others before her , all at the same time , for all I know . " He lowered his voice . " Phoebe , believe me , it hurts me immeasurably to distress you in this way , but it is too important a matter for anything less than honesty and clear-headedness . " He took a heavy breath , and speaking with apparent difficulty said , " You referred to an episode in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ashamed . I will not speak of it , now or ever . It is not a subject to be discussed with my daughter . However , it is because I wish to spare you the unhappiness I caused your mother that I refuse to let you marry a man like Mr. Stanhope . It is my final word . You can weep and wail , although that is not natural to you , or you may rant and rage at me ; it will not alter my resolution one jot . You may write to your mother , to ask her to exert her influence with me , but I tell you that it will all be in vain . I know that your mama will be at one with me on this , and you know me well enough to be sure that once my mind is made up I am implacable . " <p> Phoebe left her father 's study in a state of greater anger than she had ever known . Her father had risen from his seat and come around the desk to pat her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , although she drew away from him . Then he said , unforgivably , in her eyes , " One day you will thank me for this . You will meet another man , a better man , who loves you and whom you will love and with whom you will make a very happy marriage . It is not as though you have not had other admirers ; indeed , you know I have had more than one young man approach me to ask consent to pay his addresses . You have laughed and scorned them all and asked me to refuse all your suitors , however eligible some of them were . I can understand how a man of fashion and address such as Mr. Stanhope could have caught your fancy , but I assure you fancy is all it is . You could not truly love a man of his character . " <p> The problem was that Phoebe did love Arthur Stanhope , that she had never loved any man before , and that she could see no way that she would ever care for another man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had come dancing down the stairs , but it was with feet of lead , and a heart as heavy , that she ascended the stairs to return to her room . To her relief , Miniver was not in the room . She did not give way to tears , nor throw herself on the bed , nor take up the pretty vase from beside her bed and dash it to the floor . Instead , she went to the window and looked out over the square , her heart thumping inside her chest like a drum marching men into battle . The weather matched her mood . Lowering grey clouds hung over London , a steady drizzle made the pavements look dark and dirty . The trees in the garden in the centre of the square still had a wintry look to them ; spring was late this year . She turned away from the window and went across to her little walnut writing desk . She sat down , took out a sheet of notepaper , dipped a quill into the ink , and began to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ further . A letter would not do , how could she say all she had to in a letter ? No , she would n't write to him , she would go to see him . <p> Once this plan entered her head , she brushed away all thoughts of how improper such an action would be . If anyone saw her going into his house , then her reputation would lie in shreds . <p> So much the better , she told herself as she pulled the bell with vigour , calling out at the same time for Miniver , whom she felt sure would be lurking somewhere in the vicinity . She did n't want to take Miniver into her confidence , and so she simply told her to fetch her pelisse , as she was going out . <p> " Going out where , Miss Phoebe ? Shall I ask for the carriage to be brought round ? And I 'll have to put on my own outdoor clothes , I had no idea of your going out so early , and I 've all your jewellery lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Go and fetch me a hackney cab , and do n't you dare let my father get wind of what I am about . " <p> " A hackney cab ? Go alone in a hackney cab ? And where to , may I ask ? " <p> " You may not . " <p> " It 's more than my place is worth . Sir Giles would scalp me , and then turn me off without a reference . A fine thing that would be ! " <p> " Oh , very well , you may come with me . Go and find a cab , and tell it to wait around the corner . " <p> Miniver pursed her lips . " It is n't right . " <p> Phoebe was not in the mood to put up with Miniver 's moral disapproval . " It is n't for you to say what is or is n't right . I will be out in ten minutes , be there with the hackney cab . " <p> Miniver shut the door behind her with a bang discreet enough not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to express her disapproval . Phoebe sank down on the chintz-covered sofa . She closed her eyes , as if by doing so she could shut out the images flitting through her mind . She could remember last night with such startling clarity that the scene might be taking place again there before her eyes . She had been at an informal party , given by the rich and amiable Mr. Portal . The season was not yet under way , but Phoebe had come early to town with her father , who had parliamentary business to attend to . Her mother was due to come up to London next week . <p> It was just such a party as Phoebe liked best . And her pleasure in the evening was capped by the arrival of Arthur Stanhope . She had been standing beside Mr. Portal , and laughing at one of his witty remarks , when she saw Arthur Stanhope standing at the door . Their eyes met , hers brimming with merriment , and his amused and alight with pleasure in seeing her . <p> They talked , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conversation which , Phoebe felt , could go on for the rest of their lives and never grow boring . They went down to supper together , and then afterwards , her cousin Camilla persuaded her sister Alethea to play some dances for the company . <p> Oh , that exquisite moment when Mr. Stanhope took Phoebe aside and led her into a little alcove , quite deserted , and there took her into his arms , and in a voice quite unlike his usual calm tones , told her he loved her . His kiss , gentle , then growing more passionate , had wrapped Phoebe in a cloud of velvet delight , and when they drew apart to look into one another 's eyes , she felt a joy such as she had never experienced . <p> Copyright 2009 by AEB Ltd . <br> Continues ...
