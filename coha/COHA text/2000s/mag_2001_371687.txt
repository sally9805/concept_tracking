This hokey 1958 Broadway hit has justly languished in dinner theaters ever since . Now , in a radical revision at Los Angeles ' Mark Taper Forum , playwright David Henry Hwang treats the original like " some kind of weird Oriental minstrel show , " as one character puts it , and wraps its assimilationist anthems into a merry multicultural trip from Tiananmen Square to San Francisco 's Chinatown . Director-choreographer Robert Longbottom adds a dollop of kitsch  --  and somehow the mix is funny and clever . It even jerks a tear or two . Broadway , get ready ! <P>  --  By Margot Roosevelt
