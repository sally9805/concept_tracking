Chapter One Tuesday , September 12 Washington , D.C. There was a saying in Washington that lawyers ran the government , but spies ran the lawyers . The city was cobwebbed with intelligence agencies , everything from the legendary CIA and FBI and the little-known NRO to alphabet groups in all branches of the military and government , even in the illustrious Departments of State and Justice . Too many , in the opinion of President Samuel Adams Castilla . And too public . Rivalries were notoriously a problem . Sharing information that inadvertently included misinformation was a bigger problem . Then there was the dangerous sluggishness of so many bureaucracies . The president was worrying about this and a brewing international crisis as his black Lincoln Town Car cruised along a narrow back road on the northern bank of the Anacostia River . Its motor was a quiet hum , and its tinted windows opaque . The car rolled past tangled woods and the usual lighted marinas until it finally rattled over the rusted tracks of a rail spur , where it turned right into a busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Anacostia Seagoing Yacht Club Private . Members Only . The yacht club appeared identical to all the others that lined the river east of the Washington Navy Yard . It was an hour before midnight . Only a few miles above the Anacostia 's confluence with the broad Potomac , the marina moored big , open-water power cruisers and long-distance sailing boats , as well as the usual weekend pleasure craft . President Castilla gazed out his window at the piers , which jutted out into the dusky water . At several , a number of salt-encrusted oceangoing yachts were just docking . Their crews still wore foul-weather gear . He saw that there were also five frame buildings of varying sizes on the grounds . The layout was exactly what had been described to him . The Lincoln glided to a halt behind the largest of the lighted buildings , out of sight of the piers and hidden from the road by the thick woods . Four of the men riding in the Lincoln with him , all wearing business suits and carrying minisubmachine guns , swiftly stepped out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night-vision goggles as they scanned the darkness . Finally , one of the four turned back toward the Lincoln and gave a sharp nod . The fifth man , who had been sitting beside the president , also wore a dark business suit , but he carried a 9mm Sig Sauer . In response to the signal , the president handed him a key , and he hurried from the car to a barely visible side door in the building . He inserted the key into a hidden lock and swung open the door . He turned and spread his feet , weapon poised . At that point , the ear door that was closest to the building opened . The night air was cool and crisp , tainted with the stench of diesel . The president emerged into it-a tall , heavyset man wearing chino slacks and a casual sport jacket . For such a big man , he moved swiftly as he entered the building . The fifth guard gave a final glance around and followed with two of the four others . The remaining pair took stations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( " Fred " ) Klein , the rumpled chief of Covert-One , sat behind a cluttered metal desk in his compact office inside the marina building . This was the new Covert-One nerve center . In the beginning , just a few years ago , Covert-One had no formal organization of bureaucracy , no real headquarters , and no official operatives . It had been loosely composed of professional experts in many fields , all with clandestine experience , most with military backgrounds , and all essentially unencumbered-without family , home ties , or obligations , either temporary or permanent . But now that three major international crises had stretched the resources of the elite cadre to the limits , the president had decided his ultrasecret agency needed more personnel and a permanent base far from the radar screens of Pennsylvania Avenue , the Hill , or the Pentagon . The result was this " private yacht club . " It had the right elements for clandestine work : It was open and active twenty-four hours a day , seven days a week , with intermittent but steady traffic from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and the rail spur but still on the grounds was a helipad that looked more like a weed-infested field . The latest electronic communications had been installed throughout the base , and the security was nearly invisible but of cutting-edge quality . Not even a dragonfly could cross the periphery without one of the sensors picking it up . Alone in his office , the sounds of his small nighttime staff muted beyond his door , Klein closed his eyes and rubbed the bridge of his longish nose . His wire-rimmed glasses rested on the desk . Tonight he looked every one of his sixty years . Since he had accepted the job of heading Covert-One , he had aged . His enigmatic face was riven with new creases , and his hairline bad receded an inch . Another problem was on the verge of erupting . As his headache lessened , he sat back , opened his eyes , put his glasses back on , and resumed puffing on his ever-present pipe . The room filled with billows of smoke that disappeared almost as soon as he produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ specifically for the purpose . A file folder lay open on his desk , but he did not look at it . Instead , he smoked , tapped his foot , and glanced at the ship 's clock on his wall every few seconds . At last , a door to his left , beneath the clock , opened , and a man with a Sig Sauer strode across the office to the outer door , locked it , and turned to stand with his back against it . Seconds later , the president entered . He sat in a high-backed leather chair across the desk from Klein . " Thanks , Barney , " he told the guard . " I 'll let you know if I need you . " " But Mr. President- " " You can go , " he ordered firmly . " Wait outside . This is a private conversation between two old friends . " That was partly true . He and Fred Klein had known each other since college . The guard slowly recrossed the office and left , each step radiating reluctance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of smoke . " I would 've come to you as usual , Mr. President . " " No . " Sam Castilla shook his head . His titanium glasses reflected the overhead light with a sharp flash . " Until you tell me exactly what we 're facing with this Chinese freighter-The Dowager Empress , right ? - this one stays between us and those of your agents you need to work on it . " " The leaks are that bad ? " " Worse , " the president said . " The White House has turned into a sieve . I 've never seen anything like it . Until my people can find the source , I 'll meet you here . " His rangy face was deeply worried . " You think we have another Yinhe ? " Klein 's mind was instantly transported back : It was 1993 , and a nasty international incident was about to erupt , with America the big loser . A Chinese cargo ship , the Yinhe , had sailed from China for Iran . U.S. intelligence received reports the ship was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After trying the usual diplomatic channels and failing , President Bill Clinton ordered the U.S. Navy to chase the ship , refusing to let it land anywhere , until some sort of resolution could be found . An outraged China denied the accusations . Prominent world leaders jawboned . Allies made charges and countercharges . And media around the globe covered the standoff with banner headlines . The stalemate went on for an interminable twenty days . Finally , when China began to noisily rattle its sabers , the U.S. Navy forced the ship to stop on the high seas , and inspectors boarded the Yinhe . To America 's great embarrassment , they uncovered only agricultural equipment-plows , shovels , and small tractors . The intelligence had been faulty . With a grimace , Klein recalled it all too well . The episode made America look like a thug . Its relations with China , and even its allies , were strained for years . He puffed gloomily , fanning the smoke away from the president . " Do we have another Yinhe ? " he repeated . " Maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and ' maybe ' probably . You better tell me all of it . Chapter and verse . " Klein tamped down the ash in his pipe . " One of our operatives is a professional Sinologist who 's been working in Shanghai the past ten years for a consortium of American firms that are trying to get a foothold there . His name 's Avery Mondragon . He 's alerted us to information he 's uncovered that The Dowager Empress is carrying tens of tons of thiodiglycol , used in blister weapons , and thionyl chloride , used in both blister and nerve weapons . The freighter was loaded in Shanghai , is already at sea , and is destined for Iraq . Both chemicals have legitimate agricultural uses , of course , but not in such large quantities for a nation the size of Iraq . " " How good is the information this time , Fred ? One hundred percent ? Ninety ? " " I have n't seen it , " Klein said evenly , puffing a cloud of smoke and forgetting to wave it away this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has the ship 's true invoice manifest . " " Great God . " Castilla 's thick shoulders and heavy torso seemed to go rigid against his chair . " I do n't know whether you realize it , but China is one of the signatories of the international agreement that prohibits development , production , stockpiling , or use of chemical weapons . They wo n't let themselves be revealed as breaking that treaty , because it could slow their march to acquiring a bigger and bigger slice of the global economy . " " It 's a damned delicate situation . " " The price of another mistake on our part could be particularly high for us , too , now that they 're close to signing our human-rights treaty . " In exchange for financial and trade concessions from the U.S. , for which the president had cajoled and arm-twisted a reluctant Congress , China had all but committed to signing a bilateral human-rights agreement that would open its prisons and criminal courts to U.N . and U.S. inspectors , bring its criminal and civil courts closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prisoners . Such a treaty had been a high-priority goal for American presidents since Dick Nixon . Sam Castilla wanted nothing to stop it . In fact , it was a long-standing dream of his , too , for personal as well as human-rights reasons . " It 's also a damned dangerous situation . We ca n't allow this ship ... what was it , The Dowager Empress ? " Klein nodded . " We ca n't allow The Dowager Empress to sail into Basra with weapons-making chemicals . That 's the bottom line . Period . " Castilla stood and paced . " If your intelligence turns out to be good , and we go after this Dowager Empress , how are the Chinese going to react ? " He shook his head and waved away his own words . " No , that 's not the question , is it ? We know how they 'll react . They 'll shake their swords , denounce , and posture . The question is what will they actually do ? " He looked at Klein . " Especially if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of predict that , Mr. President . On the other hand , no nation can maintain massive armies and nuclear weapons without using them somewhere , sometime , if for no other reason than to justify the costs . " " I disagree . If a country 's economy is good , and its people are happy , a leader can maintain an army without using it . " " Of course , if China wants to use the incident as an excuse that they 're being threatened , they might invade Taiwan , " Fred Klein continued . " They 've wanted to do that for decades . " " If they feel we wo n't retaliate , yes . There 's Central Asia , too , now that Russia is less of a regional threat . " The Covert-One chief said the words neither wanted to think : " With their long-range nuclear weapons , we 're as much a target as any country . " Castilla shook off a shudder . Klein removed his glasses and massaged his temples . They were silent . At last , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right , I 'll have Admiral Brose order the navy to follow and monitor The Dowager Empress . We 'll label it routine at-sea surveillance with no revelation of the actual situation to anyone but Brose . " " The Chinese will find out we 're shadowing their ship . " " We 'll stall . The problem is , I do n't know how long we 'll be able to get away with it . " The president went to the door and stopped . When he turned , his face was long and somber , his jowls pronounced . " I need proof , Fred . I need it now . Get me that manifest . " " You 'll have it , Sam . " His big shoulders hunched with worry , President Castilla nodded , opened the door , and walked away . One of the secret service agents closed it . Alone again , Klein frowned , contemplating his next step . As he heard the engine of the president 's car hum to life , he made a decision . He swiveled to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat . One was red-a single , direct , scrambled line to the president . The other was blue . It was also scrambled . He picked up the blue phone and dialed . Wednesday , September 13 Kaohsiung , Taiwan After a medium-rare hamburger and a bottle of Taiwanese lager at Smokey Joe 's on Chunghsiao-1 Road , Jon Smith decided to take a taxi to Kaohsiung Harbor . He still had an hour before his afternoon meetings resumed at the Grand Hi-Lai Hotel , when his old friend , Mike Kerns from the Pasteur Institute in Paris , would meet him there . Smith had been in Kaohsiung-Taiwan 's second-largest city-nearly a week , but today was the first chance he 'd had to explore . That kind of intensity was what usually happened at scientific conferences , at least in his experience . Assigned to the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases-USAMRIID-he was a medical doctor and biomolecular scientist as well as an army lieutenant colonel . He had left his work on defenses against anthrax to attend this one-the Pacific Rim International Assembly on Developments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like fish and guests , got stale after three or four days . Hatless , in civilian clothes , he strode along the waterfront , marveling at the magnificent harbor , the third-largest container port in the world , after Hong Kong and Singapore . He had visited here years ago , before a tunnel was built to the mainland and the paradisaical island became just another congested part of the container port . The day was postcard clear , so he was able to easily spot Hsiao Liuchiu Island , low on the southern horizon . He walked another fifteen minutes through the sun-hazed day as seagulls circled overhead and the clatter of a harbor at work filled his ears . Continues ...
