In the summer of 1988 , Vice President George H. W. Bush was foundering . His opponent in the presidential race , Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis , was doing well in the polls . That fall , however , pro-Bush forces deftly used wedge issues  --  particularly crime and the specter of encroaching liberalism  --  to cleave white working-class voters from the Democratic Party . The nastiest and most effective ' 88 political ad featured the hardened visage of convict William Horton , a murderer who had fled Massachusetts during a prison furlough and then stabbed a man and raped his fianc . Republicans said Dukakis had turned his state 's prison gates into " a revolving door . " Dukakis pointed out that he had actually ended the furlough program , but his protest was late and languid . Bush won comfortably , 54% to 46% . <P> At the start of the 2004 campaign , it seemed that Bush the son would also use wedge issues to repel a Massachusetts rival . Earlier this year , just as John Kerry was celebrating primary victories , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in most of the U.S. that legalized marriage for same-sex couples . The court ordered the state to begin issuing marriage licenses to gays by mid-May . Social conservatives despaired at the ruling , but Republicans savored the idea that , all summer , newspapers would run pictures of men kissing each other on Cape Cod .

Bush said he would work to pass a U.S. constitutional amendment banning gay marriage . But as the race got under way , the Bush campaign had to decide whether to portray Kerry as a committed lefty or a squishy flip-flopper . Though both caricatures were used , the G.O.P. campaign focused far more on the question of whether Kerry could provide steady leadership in uncertain times . Saying that Kerry takes multiple positions has now made it harder to claim he 's on the wrong side of wedge issues . <P> Voters are not convinced that he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conducted after last week 's third presidential debate ( see chart , pages 36-37 ) , suggests that wedge issues , which normally work to the Republicans ' advantage , are not a big G.O.P. plus this time . Asked whom they trust to handle " moral-values issues such as gay marriage and abortion , " more voters chose Bush ( 44% ) than Kerry ( 42% ) , though the difference was within the margin for error . In early September the numbers were 51% to 37% in Bush 's favor .
