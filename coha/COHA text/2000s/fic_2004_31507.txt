August heat pummeled Las Vegas , the nighttime temperature hovering just over 100 degrees , driving the natives inside the air-conditioned sanctity of their homes . Out on Las Vegas Boulevard , in front of Treasure Island , electronically controlled sprayers over the sidewalks cool-misted the crowd as they watched pirates killing each other ... though where mist stopped and the sweat started , who could say ? Downtown , on Fremont Street , even as the evening light show flashed overhead like gaudy lightning , many of the usual gawkers ducked into the coolness of casinos lining the pedestrian mall . Hearing Sinatra sing about luck being a lady , craning your head back to watch giant tumbling electric dice , was n't nearly so much fun when salty pools of perspiration settled in and around your eyes . In the desert around the city , even the animals were hunkering down , seeking the coolest spots Mother Nature could provide . Coyotes lay silent , too parched to howl , and the snakes sought refuge under rocks , away from the scorching desert air , slithering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garden of Eden . During the day , when the heat did its worst , the temperature rising to over 110 degrees , tourists still milled around the Strip , shuffling with the dutiful doggedness of the vacationer ( " We paid for this fun package , and by God ... " ) from one attraction to the next , all of them bleeding sweat , each weary traveler trudging along shell-shocked , wondering how they aimed for an oasis and wound up instead in the Ninth Circle of Hell . The endless parade  --  this Bataan Death March outfitted in garish T-shirts , Bermuda shorts , and dark socks with sandals  --  took each step as if absorbing a punch . Stuck in traffic , watching the sorry spectacle , Captain Jim Brass could relate , even though his Ford Taurus 's air conditioner was cranked to the max . It 's not the heat , he thought , it 's the humanity . The coolness of the car 's interior did nothing to relieve the sensation that he was being pummeled with each throb of a massive headache that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had no intention of leaving , though the party was long since over . He had n't even taken off his sportcoat , a sharp brown number that with his gold-patterned tie reflected an improved fashion sense that admittedly had taken him years past his divorce to cultivate . A compact man with short brown hair and a melancholy mien that belied an inner alertness , Jim Brass fought hard against cynicism , and mostly won . But what Brass had not seen in his almost twenty-five years on the Las Vegas Police Department , he was not anxious to . As usual , the summer heat had brought out the crazies  --  local and imported . Here it was , not even the fifteenth of August , and already the city was pushing double-digit homicides for the month . LVPD had averaged investigating just over a dozen homicides per month for the last two years  --  a staggering number for a department short of bodies , at least the right kind of bodies  --  and now the heat seemed to be driving that number off the graph . Brass worried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sooner the city might boil over .... And , of course , the politics of Brass 's job were as unrelenting as the blinding sun . There was , as the saying went , a new sheriff in town ... who was bringing down some heat of his own . Former Sheriff Brian Mobley , had  --  after a failed mayoral bid  --  resigned ; Mobley had never been anybody 's favorite administrator , and few mourned his passing . But Sheriff Rory Atwater , while possessing better people skills than his predecessor , was no pushover . Atwater wanted the spate of killings stopped , and  --  Brass had already learned , in the new sheriff 's first few months on the job  --  what Rory Atwater wanted , Rory Atwater generally got . Both sheriffs were good , honest cops ; but each was , in his way , a career politician , which only reflected the reality of the waters both lawmen had to swim in . The difference was : Mobley had always seemed like a high-school bully trying to behave himself while running for class @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smoother , more polished , and there were those in the department who considered the new boss a barracuda in a tailored suit . Sighing to himself , stuck behind an SUV at a light , Brass pondered the latest absurdity : Atwater 's meetings and memos had made it clear the sheriff expected these murders ( and probably the damned heat wave as well ) to stop simply because the man wanted them to ... as if he could will homicide to take its own Vegas vacation . And it was up to Brass and the rest of the LVPD to turn the sheriff 's desire into reality ... with the results expected sooner , not later . The snarled line of cars pulled forward another yard and Brass eased ahead , his eyes flicking toward the switch for the flashers . He was tempted , but he would n't break the rules and , besides , what the hell good would it do ? Even if the cars ahead were willing to move out of the way , they could n't . Another twenty minutes passed before Brass finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the car into HQ , the broiling temperature popping beads of sweat out on his forehead , despite the short walk into the building . Sidestepping the metal detector , Brass nodded to the uniformed officer guarding the entrance and resisted the urge to mop his brow with his sleeve ; the fabric would n't like it . Metal detectors had become SOP for many government buildings after 9/11 , and Vegas had been no different from hundreds of other American cities in jumping on the security bandwagon . The officer at the door was a post-9/11 occurrence as well . City Hall 's atrium lobby was large and saw a great deal of foot traffic during any given day . Today was typical , with pedestrians seemingly everywhere and Brass having to duck in and out of the crowd as he made his way toward the elevator . He had just squeezed in , touched the button for the correct floor , and was watching the doors slide shut when a suit-coated arm broke through and stopped them . Amid frowns and sighs from the half-dozen other people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  Sheriff Rory Atwater strode into the elevator and gave them all a quick once-over and smile , as if this were a meeting he 'd convened . Then he nodded and turned to face front . The sheriff  --  in a double-breasted gray suit , white shirt with a red and blue patterned tie  --  showed no sign whatever that he had spent even a second in the blast furnace outside . The man 's wide gray eyes matched his suit and his light brown hair , slowly turning silver , was close-cropped and as neatly trimmed as his thick mustache . The effect was dignified and gave weight to his self-possession , serving to make him appear older than his forty-five years . " Well , this saves me a phone call , " Atwater said cheerfully , tossing a grin toward the detective who found himself at the sheriff 's side . Brass managed to smile just enough in return , inwardly wondering , Now what in hell ? " Does it ? " Brass said mildly . " It does , " Atwater said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office . " Liking this conversation less and less , Brass tried to bow out . " I was just going to stop by my office for a second , then head over to CSI to check on some evidence .... " Atwater 's grin carried no mirth . " This meeting takes precedence . " The bell announcing the second floor interrupted any further explanation Atwater might have offered . Passengers scurried between and around them , all but two others getting off . The sheriff and his subordinate eyed each other as the doors whispered shut and the car again rose . Brass twitched a noncommittal smile . " Mind if I ask who I 'll be meeting ? " With his voice lowered almost theatrically , the sheriff replied , " Rebecca Bennett .... You recognize the name , of course . " Brass shook his head . " Ca n't say I do . " " I guess that 's understandable , " the sheriff said , as if forgiving the detective . " She has n't been around for a while  --  most of the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , Sheriff . " The doors opened on the third floor and the other two passengers got out to finally give the two law enforcement officers some privacy . As the door closed , Atwater said , " Well , you 've no doubt heard of her mother . " No bells rang for Brass . " Bennett " was the kind of name the phone book had no shortage of . The sheriff raised an eyebrow . " Rita Bennett ? " The third floor bell rang and so did another in the detective 's mind  --  an alarm bell . They stepped onto the third floor . " The car dealer , " Brass said . And a major political contributor of yours , Sheriff , he thought . " But did n't she pass away not long ago ? " Right after your election ... ? " Yes , she did . She was a dear woman , a dear friend . " The sheriff 's grief seemed genuine enough ; but perhaps any politician had the ability to truly mourn the death of a money source @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had won custody of one of her ex-husband 's used car lots in their divorce settlement some fifteen years ago , after she 'd caught hubby using his dipstick to check his secretary 's oil in his office . She had turned the used car lot into one of the top GM dealerships in all the Southwest , leaving her ex in the dust . The two men were walking down the hall toward the sheriff 's office . " Mrs. Bennett had a solid reputation in this town , " Brass said , and he was not soft-soaping his boss . " But why is it we 're meeting with her daughter ? " " Let 's let the young woman tell her own story . " In the outer office , Brass saw Mrs. Mathis , the forty-something civilian secretary and holdover from Mobley 's regime . Coolly efficient and constantly a step ahead of either boss , Mrs. Mathis ran the sheriff 's office with a velvet hammer . " Miss Bennett is in your office , Sheriff , " Mrs. Mathis said as Atwater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his door , going in ahead of Brass . The room had n't really changed since Mobley had called it home  --  different awards , different diplomas , different photos of the current resident with various celebrities and politicos . The most remarkable thing about the masculine office was the striking female seated in the chair in front of the sheriff 's desk . She rose and turned to them  --  a brunette in her late twenties , beautiful even by Las Vegas standards , though her clothing was decidedly not flashy : light- blue blouse , navy slacks , navy pumps . She wore her black hair short and in curved arcs that accented her high cheekbones ; her eyes were wide-set , blue and large , conveying both alertness and a certain naivete . Her nose was small and well-sculpted , possibly the work of a plastic surgeon . And her full lips parted to reveal small , white teeth in a narrow mouth . The smile , however , was joyless , like the sheriff 's was in return . Also like the sheriff , the young woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it ? Brass wondered ; as he crossed the room toward her , Brass could almost hear himself sweating . But now he wondered if it was from the heat or in anticipation of whatever card Atwater was keeping up his sleeve . " Rebecca Bennett , " Atwater said , " this is Captain Jim Brass  --  if there 's a finer detective in the department , I 'd like to meet him . " This ambiguous praise sent another round of warning bells clanging inside Brass 's brain as he stuck out his hand toward the Bennett woman . Atwater was about to spring some surprise , Brass just knew it  --  but did n't know where it would hit him . Rebecca Bennett had a firm handshake and a no-nonsense cast to her eyes . And was there something predatory in those small , white , sharp teeth ... ? " Captain Brass , " she acknowledged as they shook . " Ms. Bennett , " Brass said . " My condolences on your recent loss . " " Thank you , Captain . Actually , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk and motioned for her to sit and for Brass to sit next to her . " Miss Bennett , " the sheriff began . " Rory , you 're a family friend . Just because you have n't seen me since I was a kid  --  it 's still ' Rebecca ' .... " " Rebecca . " His eyes narrowed . " I know this has been ... difficult for you . " " I 'm sure you do . " Atwater looked thoughtful , then assumed an expression that Brass knew all too well : sad eyes , soft frown , the staples of generic concern . " Rebecca , why do n't you explain your ... situation ... to Captain Brass . " Odd way to put it  --  situation . Glancing sidelong at the woman , Brass could see Rebecca composing herself . Something was wrong here , or anyway ... weird . " You offered your condolences about my mother , " Rebecca said , her voice strangely businesslike . " I hope that was appropriate , " Brass said , wondering if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't , " she said with an odd little smile . " But you could n't know that . " " Your mother was a unique woman , " Atwater put in . " Larger than life  --  it 's understandable that you 'd be ... conflicted . " What the hell was up , here ? Rebecca shrugged . " You could call it that . " " If you 'll excuse me , " Brass said , " maybe I 'm the great detective the sheriff implied ... maybe not ... but I 'm definitely not good enough to read between these lines . Please , Ms. Bennett  --  what 's this about ? " " Excuse me , Captain Brass , " the woman said . " I sort of ... forgot that you were in the dark here . You see , I already filled in Sheriff Atwater , in some detail . " Brass shot a look at the sheriff who wore his politician 's smile and shrugged , just a little . Rebecca said , " You see , my mother and I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my father after high school , and never looked back . " " Sorry to hear this , " Brass said . A thought of his own estranged daughter , Ellie , flashed through his mind ; but then something gripped him : Why was the disaffected daughter of a political contributor important to Atwater ? " Captain Brass , " she was saying , " I do regret it ... now . You get a little older and understand that you 've probably held your parents to an unrealistic standard . But the bitterness between us was very real . She wrote me a letter , oh , seven years ago , but I never responded , and ... Anyway , I always meant to reestablish contact with Mother , but the timing just never seemed right . And now , of course ... it 's too late . " She shrugged . No tears , not even wet eyes  --  just a shrug . Atwater said , " You should give Captain Brass the background of this ... situation . " Situation again . " Captain , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his flagship car lot ... in their divorce ... that I learned her new boyfriend was actually someone she 'd been seeing at the very same time my father was indulging in his own extramarital meanderings .... In other words , she was playing the violated wife in the divorce court , when she herself had been cheating . Her lover was one Peter Thompson , and they 'd been seeing each other for months before Mother caught Daddy ... what 's the term ? In flagrante delicto ? ... with that bimbo secretary of his . Would you like to know something interesting ? " Brass , fairly overwhelmed by this little soap opera , said , " Sure . " " My mother never fired the woman  --  Daddy 's secretary , I mean . Do n't you think it 's possible the secretary was in on it ? That it was a put-up job ? " Brass said , " Possible . " " Anyway , my finding out that Mommy screwed Daddy over was what drove the wedge between us . My father going broke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exactly ... help . I did n't even go to the wedding when she married Peter . I was still in high school then  --  that was one of our four-alarm arguments , let me tell you . " " I can imagine , " Brass said . " How long since you 've spoken to your mother ? " " Over ten years . " Another shrug . " As I said , since shortly after my eighteenth birthday ... when I moved out . Not so much as a Christmas card . " " And , if you do n't mind my asking , " Brass said , " what have you been doing all this time ? " " I worked my way through Cabrerra University in Miami . Waitressing . Took six years to get the four-year degree . " " Why Miami ? " " That seemed about as far away from home as I could get without falling in the ocean . I majored in hotel/motel management  --  both my parents had business in their blood , and it got passed on , I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami , last six years . Two months ago , I got transferred out here  --  the Sphere . " " Finding yourself in such close proximity to your mother  --  did you try to contact her ? " " Yes ... yes , I thought fate had finally put me on the spot . Time to be a grown-up and make some kind of peace with the miserable bitch . " She laughed harshly and then it turned into a sob . She got into her purse , found a tissue , and dried her eyes . Brass and Atwater exchanged raised eyebrows . Then Rebecca was talking again . " That was when ... when I finally learned that she 'd died . Just this May . " " You talked to your stepfather ? " " Yes  --  he said she died peacefully . " She paused for a long , ragged breath . " In her sleep . " Brass glanced at Atwater , but the sheriff had his eyes on Rebecca Bennett . " But you do n't believe him , " Atwater prompted . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what brought you here today , is n't it ? " Hesitating , Rebecca glanced between the two men before saying , " Yes . I think my stepfather murdered my mother . " A prickle of anger tweaked the back of Brass 's neck  --  so that was why Atwater had brought him in on this ! With the daughter of a deceased major contributor battling the widower , who could say where the money would wind up ? Brass allowed himself to cast his boss a disgusted smirk , but Atwater did n't seem to notice  --  he appeared placid , somberly so . Just a concerned friend of the family , trying to do the right thing ... " I want you to know right now , Rebecca , " Atwater said , " that we 'll look into this immediately ... and thoroughly . " Brass had sense enough to tread carefully around the sheriff when Atwater was playing one of those cards from up his sleeve . Nonetheless , he asked , " Why do n't you believe your stepfather , Ms. Bennett ? " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her surprised face . Apparently it had never occurred to her that anyone might question her reasoning , much less her motives . " There are several things , " she finally said , as if that were explanation enough . " What were the autopsy results ? " Rebecca 's mouth formed a sarcastic kiss . " What autopsy results ? " " There was no autopsy ? " She shook her head . " In fact , that 's one of the reasons I suspect Peter  --  he told me an autopsy would have been contrary to my mother 's wishes ... due to her religious beliefs . " " And you 're skeptical of that reason ? " " I 'm skeptical of that excuse  --  I 've been away from Mom for a long time , and I understand that things can change , people can change ... but she was n't religious at all when I lived with her . " " Some kind of religious conversion , then .... " Brass offered . " Yes , a conservative fundamentalistic church she and Peter joined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all of that b.s . " " Not everyone considers that belief ' b.s. , ' Ms. Bennett .... " " I know , I know .... I do n't mean to sound like some kind of religious bigot , but it just ... seems very drastic for Mom . Out of character . But there are other things too . For example ... Peter got everything in Mom 's will . " Brass already knew why Atwater was here ( to protect his ass , whichever Bennett inheritor wound up with the family fortune ) and why he himself was here ( to provide Atwater with a potential fall guy ) ; and now , finally , Brass understood why Rebecca Bennett was here . Whatever contempt she might have felt for her mother , Rebecca wanted her share . Her piece . She must have read what he was thinking , because she quickly said , " Understand , it 's not about the money . " Keeping his face neutral , Brass nodded . Very little was certain in this wicked world ; but one thing Jim Brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money  --  it was about the money . " My mother 's fortune was built on my father 's used car business  --  a business she and Peter Thompson all but swindled Daddy out of . That after all these years Peter would be the one to benefit  --  it 's just too much . Just too goddamn much . " " Ms. Bennett  --  " She sat forward , blue eyes flashing . " There just seems to be so much ... secrecy about my mother 's death , and when I tried to talk to Peter ? He shut me out . " " Which is why , " Atwater said , with terrible casualness , " you want her exhumed . " Brass sat up like a sleeping driver awakened by a truck horn . " Ex- , " Brass said , " - humed ? " " Yes , " Rebecca said , with her own dreadful ease . " I want my mother exhumed , and an autopsy performed , so I 'll know once and for all whether or not Peter Thompson killed her . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly your stepfather will fight you on this .... " She laughed , head back , as if proud of herself . " He promised me he would . He hates me like poison ... and he 'll use my own murdered mother 's money against me . " Softly , to try to bring the melodrama down a notch , Brass said , " We 'll check him out . " " What about the exhumation ? " she asked , sitting forward , excited now , nostrils flaring , tiny teeth clenched . " Well ... " Brass said , looking toward the sheriff , who would surely have the sense to call off this witch hunt .... Atwater jumped into the situation with both feet ... which of course landed on Brass , right where the sun did n't shine , even in a Vegas heat wave . " The exhumation will be no problem , " Atwater said , his gaze flicking for just a second to Brass , then back to his potentially lucrative audience . " As your mother 's last blood relative , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suspicions about your stepfather . My best man , Captain Brass , will see to it ... personally . " Here they were , murders up higher than the temp , and Sheriff Atwater was assigning him a case that was little more than a political favor . In his mind , Brass said , " Like hell I will . Do your own damn political bullshit ! " But what he said was , " Get right on it , Ms. Bennett . " He had to swim in these waters , too . The Desert Palm Memorial Cemetery occupied a lush green space not far from the intersection of North Las Vegas Boulevard and Main Street . Two days had passed since Captain Brass met with Sheriff Atwater and Rebecca Bennett , and the detective stood with court order in hand , in the middle of the cemetery . Like most grave robbers , they were working in the wee hours  --  at the behest of the cemetery management , who requested that this effort not interrupt their regularly scheduled interments . The desert was cool at night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the way down to ninety-eight , with a slight devil's-breath breeze . Of course this was actually morning , about two hours from dawn , toward the end of the CSI graveyard shift ... literally graveyard , this time . Brass was well aware that CSI Supervisor Gil Grissom sympathized with his distaste for politics . But they all had a job to do , including two more nightshift crime scene analysts , Sara Sidle and Nick Stokes . The four of them cast long shadows in the light of a full moon as they waited while a backhoe tore open the earth over Rita Bennett 's grave . Two gravediggers were paid accomplices tonight on this ghoulish mission . Joe , a lanky guy with stringy black hair and sky blue eyes , sat atop the backhoe . His partner , Bob , shorter but just as skinny , stood beyond the grave directing Joe to make sure the backhoe did n't smash the concrete vault that held Rita Bennett 's casket . Both men wore filthy white T-shirts and grime-impacted blue jeans , appropriate for this dirty job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respectful to the deceased they were disturbing . Next to the backhoe , a flat bronze headstone with Rita 's name , birth , and death dates carved into it , stood on edge , standing sentinel over the awkward proceedings . Brass and the CSIs stood well off to one side , watching the growling machine paw at the dirt . Moderately tall with graying hair and a trim dark beard , Gil Grissom was dressed in black , head to toe , blending with the night . Even when the sun was out , though , the man in black gave no sign that the heat bothered him in the least . Brass , meanwhile , wore a tan sportcoat and light color shirt and had , all day , felt like he was walking around inside a burning building . Grissom 's two associates seemed dressed more appropriately for the weather . Sara , her dark hair tucked under a CSI ball cap , wore tan slacks and a brown short-sleeve blouse ; her oval face had a ghostly beauty in the moonlight . Square-jawed , kind-eyed Nick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ T-shirt doing its best to contain the former jock 's brawn ; his dark hair was cut high over his ears and he seemed almost as at ease in the heat as Grissom . Stokes said , " With the run of murders we been havin ' , I would n't think the sheriff would want to go digging up new customers . " " If it does turn out to be a legitimate customer , Nick , " Grissom said , in his light but pointed way , " we 'll give full service . " " No autopsy , " Sara said . " That does n't smell right . " " Do n't say ' smell ' at an exhumation , " Nick said . " That 's not inherently suspicious , " Grissom said to Sara , meaning the lack of autopsy . " Some people want to get shuffled off this mortal coil in one piece .... Not unusual for religious beliefs to preclude an autopsy . " Sara made a face and shrugged . " I 'm just saying . " But that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gouge in the earth . Before long , Bob the gravedigger waved for Joe , the backhoe operator , to stop . Joe climbed down off the machine and the two men met at the head of the grave , in executive session , apparently . " Everything okay ? " Brass asked with a frown . Bob , hands on hips , looked over . " We 've reached the vault . " Brass and the CSIs moved to where Bob and Joe stood at the edge of a hole that went down three to three-and-a-half-feet . Barely visible at the bottom was a sliver of something brown . " Have to dig the rest by hand , " Bob said . " Graves on each side are too close to use the backhoe , and ' course we do n't want to damage the vault . " Brass knew this and so did Grissom , Sara , and Nick ; but the gravedigger had never done an exhumation with this group before , and he seemed to enjoy sharing his wealth of information . " Not our first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do what you do . " " Could take some time , " Bob said , cocking his head , relishing his power . " This is a graveyard , Bob , " Grissom said . " We 'll reflect on the relative nature of time . " " Huh ? " Bob said . " Dig , " Nick said . Bob thought about that and then a grin appeared in the midst of his dirty face . " Yeah  --  yeah , I dig . " And the gravedigger scurried back to work , as Sara and Nick traded rolling-eyed expressions . The detective and the three CSIs watched as the two men used tile shovels to carefully excavate around the concrete vault . Neither of the workers looked very happy as they gingerly pawed at the earth within their small hole . " Where 's the concerned daughter , " Nick asked , " to watch us dig up Mommy ? " " Be nice , Nick , " Grissom said . Brass said , " She 'll meet us back at CSI and be there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her presence . " Sara said , " If I were forced to do this , with the grave of a loved one ... ? I would n't want to be anywhere around . " Grissom looked at her curiously . " But you 're a scientist . " " Even scientists have feelings , " she said , with a mildly reproving glance . Shrugging , Grissom said , " Nobody 's perfect . " Sara and Nick took photographs of what followed . Grissom made field notes . Brass just watched . The two workers finally got cables under the vault and , using the backhoe like a crane , they lifted the concrete box out of the ground and set it on a flatbed truck . Brass and the CSIs piled into the black Tahoe and followed the vehicle back to the station , where the flatbed backed in the tall door at the end of the garage behind the CSI building . Meanwhile , Nick parked the Tahoe , after which the quartet marched inside to get down to business . The garage had spaces for three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accommodate trucks even bigger than the one that carried the strapped-down remains of Rita Bennett . Essentially a concrete bunker with a twenty-foot ceiling and an overhead crane , the garage had a workbench along the back wall and two huge tool chests , one against each of the side walls . First , Nick and Sara climbed up onto the truck and removed the straps from the vault . As they did , Brass went inside , to the office , to bring back Rebecca Bennett . As Brass disappeared through the door , Nick motioned for Grissom to come closer to the truck . Keeping one eye on the door even as he and Sara undid the straps , Nick asked , " Do n't we have better things to be doing than an exhumation to satisfy one of Atwater 's contributors ? " Grissom 's voice remained soft , but his face grew serious . " She 's not a contributor  --  her late mother was . " " What , are we gon na quibble ? " " No , Nick , we 're not going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the death of her mother ... answers that we might be able to provide . " " Hey , all I mean , there 's serious crimes  --  " " Do your job , Nick . " Nick started to say something , but Sara cut him off : " It 's a sealed vault ! Gon na take us some time gettin ' into it . " Nodding once , Grissom said , " No time like the present . " Using the overhead crane , Nick and Sara put the crane 's metal runners under the frame of the concrete lid and tightened them down . Then , using the column of buttons on the hanging control box , Nick nudged the RAISE button a few times , until the slack was gone from the chain and the vault was just about to leave the bed of the truck . Accepting a pry bar from Sara , Nick went to work on the sealed edge of one side of the vault while Sara worked on the opposite side . They had been at it for almost ten minutes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Brass reappeared with an attractive , slender , black-haired woman in dark-green slacks and a black silk blouse . Grissom extended his hand as Brass and the woman approached where he stood next to the truck . The woman 's eyes remained locked on the vault on the back of the vehicle , the two CSIs still plugging away with the pry bars . " I 'm Gil Grissom from the crime lab , " he said , his hand still hanging out in space . She finally tore her eyes from the vault , looked for a moment at his hand like she could n't understand why it was there ; then , with a visible flinch , she focused and shook it . " Sorry , " she said . " Rebecca Bennett .... I guess I was n't prepared .... " " As an abstraction , exhumation is just a word , " Grissom said . " The reality is ... sobering . You do n't have to stay long . " " No , that 's all right , " she said , her voice cold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak she 'd suddenly gathered herself in . " So that 's Mother ? " " Yes . We 've already started working on the vault , but it 's sealed ... so it 's going to take a little time . " She nodded , her eyes returning to the vault . At that moment the epoxy bond was broken and the vault settled back onto the truck bed , the shock absorbers and springs grunting as it did . The noise made Rebecca jump a little . Brass walked the woman to a chair across the garage . " Easier than I thought , " Sara said , mopping her brow with her hand . Nick gave her a sarcastic look . " Piece of cake . " Sara looked at him , smiling , but hard-eyed . " Nick ... tell me you 're not creeped out by this .... " " What ? Gim me a break . I 'm a scientist , too , you know . " " Scientists have feelings , remember ? " " After all we 've been through ? Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . " I would n't dream of it ... but we all have our little , you know ... bugaboos . " Nick grunted a small laugh . " Yeah , well help me open this one . " Rita Bennett had only been buried about three months and remarkably little odor crept over the sides of the vault and down to the trio on the floor . Using the crane , Nick set the vault lid off to one side . Brass walked over and asked , " How 's the casket look ? " The two CSIs glanced down into the vault at the same moment . Sara spoke first . " Looks good , surprisingly . " " Like brand new , " Nick added . To Sara under his breath , he said , " Only one owner .... " " Not much smell , " Sara said quietly . Their comments were sotto voce , to keep them from the daughter seated across the room . Turning to Brass , Grissom said , " One of the good things about living in the desert  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brass said , " I 'm decaying pretty damn fast these days , this heat . " Next , Nick and Sara worked straps around the casket and Nick used the crane to lift it out of the vault and swing it over the side of the truck . Lowering it slowly , Nick set the casket gently on the floor not far from Grissom and Brass . Brass turned to the seated woman and said , " Ms. Bennett  --  if you 'd join us ? " She did , and the five moved to the oaken box ; then Grissom , Brass , and Rebecca watched as Sara and Nick released the locks and flipped up the lid of the coffin . Within , Grissom had expected to find Rita Bennett looking much as she had when she 'd been buried , just three months ago . The dress would be tasteful , her makeup in place but slightly over the top , like it always had been in her TV spots for the car dealership , and her hair would be dyed platinum blonde . Looking into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He saw tennis shoes , jeans , a Las Vegas Stars T-shirt , painted fingernails , pierced ears , pink-glossed lips , and auburn hair surrounding a face that had to be younger than twenty-five . The young woman in the casket , younger than Rebecca standing next to him , looked very peaceful indeed . She just did n't happen to be Rita Bennett . Rebecca 's hand shot to her mouth and her eyes opened wide . Sara was the first to find her voice . " Uh ... oh .... " She looked atmoved to the oaken box ; then Grissom , Brass , and Rebecca watched as Sara and Nick released the locks and flipped up the lid of the coffin .

The young woman in the casket , younger than Rebecca standing next to him , looked very peaceful indeed . She just did n't happen to be Rita Bennett . Rebecca 's hand shot to her mouth and her eyes opened wide . Sara was the first to find her voice . " Uh ... oh .... " She looked at Nick , whose slack-jawed , wide-eyed expression mirrored her own . " Gris , " Nick said gingerly , " this does n't look like a heart attack . " " What have you people done with my mother ? " Rebecca demanded . She turned to Grissom and said , " Where is my mother ? " The shift supervisor turned to Brass , who seemed suddenly about three inches shorter , an invisible and very heavy weight having settled across his shoulders . Sheriff Atwater was going to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double-checked the grave location  --  right ? " " I went to the office myself , " the detective said , his voice wavering between anger , confusion , and frustration . " And the damn headstone is even in the truck ! Everything matched . " Holding up his hands , Grissom said , " No need to get defensive , Jim ... just checking . " Grissom turned to Sara and Nick with renewed energy . " If our paperwork was right , and the cemetery staff took us to the correct site ... all of which seems to have happened , then we have ourselves a brand-new crime scene . " Rebecca Bennett got between them . " I 'm thrilled for you ! But where is my mother ? " Grissom raised a palm , as if trying to stop traffic . " I do n't know , Ms. Bennett ... but I can promise you we 're going to do everything we can to find her . " " This is n't happening , " Brass said , and sat on the bumper of the truck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and now we have a murder ? " " Not necessarily , " Grissom said . " Could be a simple mistake . " The dead woman 's daughter managed to open her eyes even wider . " Simple mistake ? " Covering his eyes , Brass was calling for a dispatcher on his radio . " Forgive me , Ms. Bennett , " Grissom said . He began to lead the stunned woman away from the casket . " We , as criminalists , have to approach this as a problem that needs to be solved . But we do n't really mean to be callous . " " My mother , what the goddamn hell happened ... ? " " You have my word , Ms. Bennett  --  we 'll solve this . All your questions will be laid to rest . " " Like my mother was ? " Grissom did n't have an answer for that . Sara approached and said , " We 're very sorry about this awful turn of events . This has been a terrible traumatic thing , but please believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a uniformed officer entered . Brass joined Grissom and the distraught young woman , showing up at the same moment as the uniform man . " Ms. Bennett , " Brass said , " I 'm afraid we 're going to have to ask you to step out now . " " Are you people trying to get rid of me now ? " she asked , her voice , practically a shriek , careening off the cement walls . Grissom stepped up . " No , Ms. Bennett  --  we 're trying to preserve evidence . We have to find out what happened to the woman in your mother 's casket . " " What ... about ... my mother ? " Shaking his head , Grissom said , " The only clues we have to what happened to your mother are inside that casket with this girl . You need to let us do our job . " Rebecca obviously wanted to put up a fight , but Grissom could tell she saw the logic of his argument ; he read her as a strong , intelligent young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she allowed the uniformed officer to lead her out of the garage . Turning back to his charges , Grissom 's face was tight . " Let 's do it . " Sara was already bent over the coffin . " Blood on the pillow , " she said . " I ca n't tell more until we get the body out . " Grissom said , " All right , then ... Nick , you work the casket . Someone put her in there  --  let 's see if we ca n't find out who . Sara , find out who she is and walk her through autopsy . Tell Doc Robbins this is a rush  --  we 're already at least three months behind . " Brass added , " I 'll start with the cemetery and work my way back to the mortuary . " He checked his watch . " The staff should be there by now  --  you gon na work past the end of shift ? " Grissom nodded . " All the shifts are working overtime these days . " Sara asked , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out what happened to her , " Grissom said , " until we find her ... and the only clue we have to her whereabouts is the mystery guest buried in Rita 's grave . " " Blood on the pillow , " Sara said . " Already looking like murder . " Nick shook his head slowly . " Does n't anybody in this town ever die normal anymore ? " Grissom cast his charming smile on the younger CSI . " Where would the fun be in that , Nick ? " Continues ...
