The characters in Jennifer Egan 's intriguing new novel Look at Me ( Doubleday ; 415 pages ; $24.95 ) grope for something substantial in the blizzard of images and information that make up contemporary life . At the center is Charlotte Swenson , an aging fashion model whose face must be reconstructed , with 80 titanium screws , after a pulverizing car accident . Though she looks perfectly normal , her former cronies in Manhattan 's trendy night spots no longer recognize her , and her old life of amped-up photo shoots and weekends spent adorning the yachts of rich men slips away . <P> Meanwhile , back in Swenson 's hometown of Rockford , Ill. , another Charlotte , the plain teenage daughter of Swenson 's childhood friend , drifts between an affair with a mysterious math teacher , an older man of shifting and suspect identity , and study sessions with her uncle , a history professor . The latter 's vision of a post-industrial America infatuated with " a headlong forward motion that was inherently catastrophic " nudges him toward madness . The math @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gone awol , an ominous visitor from an unnamed part of the world filled with " dust , rage , starved zealous faces , languages he had trained himself not to think in anymore , " a man once  --  and perhaps still  --  intent on disrupting what he calls " the American conspiracy . " He probably seemed merely unsettling to Egan while she was writing the novel but now , in the wake of Sept. 11 , he is instantly menacing . <P> An unlikely blend of tabloid luridness and brainy cultural commentary , Look at Me , a finalist for the National Book Awards , is held together by the voice of the elder Charlotte , corrosively cynical yet fearless in her honesty . She is the sort of woman who , as her career and its privileges evaporate , can calmly observe , " We are interchangeable  --  the first lesson one learns as a professional beauty . " She asks , " How could I resist the offer of attention and money , the very polestars whose gleaming emanations had navigated my existence ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manages events in the lives of " ordinary people " so it can offer phony documentaries about them on the Internet . Her answer to that final question , as much as the novel 's uncanny prescience , gives Look at Me a rare urgency . <P>  --  By Laura Miller
