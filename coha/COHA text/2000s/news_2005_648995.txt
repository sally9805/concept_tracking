<p> There was a moment yesterday when Jason Giambi looked as if he might cry . He had not yet taken a question from a room full of reporters at Yankee Stadium , and he seemed to be sincerely sorry for the steroid controversy that engulfs him . <p> " I feel I let down the fans , I feel I let down the media , I feel I let down the Yankees , and not only the Yankees , but my teammates , " Giambi said , and he turned to look into the eyes of Manager Joe Torre , who was sitting on a folding chair next to him . <p> Giambi could have been a child finally summoning the courage to tell the truth to his father . But he kept his composure , and continued . " I accept full responsibility for that , and I 'm sorry , " he said . <p> What he did not fully say , however , was what he was sorry for . <p> This was Giambi 's first public statement since The San Francisco Chronicle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Giambi 's testimony to the federal grand jury in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-Operative case . In the reported testimony , Giambi admitted to using illegal steroids before and after he joined the Yankees for the 2002 season . <p> In his first response to a question yesterday , Giambi said that he had not read the Chronicle article . He added that he had told the grand jury the truth , and he did not deny any aspects of what The Chronicle reported , which seemed to be as close as he was willing to come to confirming the article . Still , he did not directly admit to steroid use . <p> " I know the fans might want more , " Giambi said . " But because of all the legal matters , I ca n't get into specifics . Someday , hopefully , I will be able to . " <p> That day was not yesterday . Giambi 's agent , Arn Tellem , said that the United States attorney in the Balco case had instructed Giambi not to comment on the Balco investigation , although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In addition , Tellem said he and Giambi 's lawyers had told him to be careful in discussing legal issues . <p> By following that advice , Giambi gave the Yankees nothing more to use against him if they do try to escape the remaining four years and $82 million on his contract , a long-shot option the team is apparently not pursuing now . <p> But Giambi 's answers came so close to acknowledging the accuracy of the Chronicle story that at one point , Tellem said , " The answers are there if you look for them . " <p> Although he did not challenge the Chronicle story , Giambi did denounce assertions that Jose Canseco is said to be making in a book to be published next week , including a charge that Giambi , Canseco and Mark McGwire injected one another with steroids as teammates on the Oakland Athletics . <p> " I find that delusional , " Giambi said . " I do n't even know where he could come up with something like that . I think it 's kind of sad that Josey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giambi met with print reporters , mostly from local newspapers , for more than 30 minutes yesterday , and then met with local radio and television reporters . There were no restrictions on what could be asked , but Tellem interjected before Giambi could answer certain questions . <p> According to The Chronicle , Giambi said he stopped taking steroids at the All-Star Game break in 2003 , almost exactly when his injuries began to flare and his production began to decline . When Giambi was asked if he could be the same player he used to be without the help of steroids , Tellem objected to the question until it was rephrased without the word steroids . <p> " Yeah , I think so , " Giambi finally answered . " That 's why I 've been working my butt off , hitting and throwing and running . Normally when I come into spring training , I would n't do a lot of hitting or throwing . I would run and be in good shape , but this year I 'm ready to rock and roll . " <p> Giambi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did last season , when his lack of strength and stamina caused Torre to leave him off the postseason roster . Giambi spent much of the season on the disabled list with ailments that included an intestinal parasite and a benign tumor , later revealed to be on his pituitary gland . <p> This winter , Giambi said , he has been working out twice a day , doing baseball exercises in the mornings and lifting weights at night . He will report to spring training in Tampa , Fla. , with the Yankees ' position players on Feb. 20 , and his personal trainer , Bob Alejo , will have the same access to team flights  --  but not to team facilities  --  that he had last season . <p> " The effort will obviously be there , " Torre said of Giambi . " But I think we 're all curious to see how he 's going to recover from what he went through . He certainly looks healthier than he did last year . " <p> Giambi went to camp last season looking markedly thinner , though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving up cheeseburgers . He weighed 228 pounds last spring and said yesterday that he now weighs between 235 and 238 pounds . <p> Torre said he did not know where Giambi fit into the Yankees ' 2005 lineup , and after the signing of first baseman Tino Martinez , it seems likely that Giambi will be used primarily as a designated hitter . Torre said Giambi would have a place in the lineup , and that he would play first at times , but he also called Giambi the Yankees ' No. 1 question . <p> " The biggest thing that I 'll be watching is not what takes place on the field , " General Manager Brian Cashman said . " It 's how he handles the process . It 's going to be a journey , and it 's going to be a long journey . Today will not end it . He knows that and we know that . " <p> Giambi said he was grateful for the support of Torre , Cashman and the teammates who have called him this winter , including Derek Jeter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he made a promise to the principal owner George Steinbrenner in a phone conversation two weeks ago . <p> " The biggest thing I told him is I 'm not a quitter , " Giambi said . " I told him I was ready to play and I was going to be that player he signed . " <p> Through his publicist , Howard Rubenstein , Steinbrenner issued a brief statement that lauded Giambi for facing the news media . " It takes a hell of a big man to stand up and apologize to his teammates , to New York Yankee fans and to baseball fans everywhere and admit he was wrong , " the statement said . <p> Giambi is sensitive , and that could make this season harder for him than it would be for a player who cares less about his image . Giambi vowed to sign more autographs and " work twice as hard " to win back fans , and he said the fans he had met this winter were supportive . <p> But when the games begin , Giambi will probably be jeered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To withstand the scrutiny , he may need to steel himself . <p> " He 's going to have to understand that even in his home ballpark , on a regular basis , he may not get the response he wants to get , " Torre said . " I think he has to be tougher . In being human , there 's only so much you can do to say , ' I understand , ' and go on about your business . It 's something he 's going to have to condition himself to do . But when he looks around , he 's going to see a lot of support . " <p> Torre said he might ask Giambi if he wants to address the team during spring training , but said he did not think that it was necessary . <p> " The biggest thing is I understand how everybody feels  --  Little Leaguers to fans to everybody , " Giambi said . " I hope the message that the parents or even the kids understand is that , hey , this is a guy who 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he 's trying to overcome . And he 's not quitting . I think that 's what makes you a man .
