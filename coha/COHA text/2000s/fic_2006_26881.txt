Chapter One How It Began Harry and George were lying in the moonlight . They 'd gone up to the no-top-world as soon as it got dark -- looking for an adventure , George had said , but there did n't seem to be one . Harry had his suspicions that George was n't so much looking for adventure as for Something Else . These are n't people we 're talking about . They 're centipedes . And not those little wiggly wire-worms you dig up in your garden , either . These are giant tropical centipedes , and they are poisonous . They have pincers on their heads to defend themselves with , and also -- I have to be perfectly frank -- to kill things with , by biting them and paralyzing them with their poison . Terrible , you think ? Cruel ? Oh , please . This is the Natural World . Not many creatures in nature get by without eating some other creature , and that includes most Hoo-Mins . What 's a Hoo-Min ? Well , you 're going to have to do a bit of guessing in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you reckon giant poisonous centipedes are scary , it may surprise you to know they 're much more scared of us . Us Hoo-Mins . Get it ? Right . We 're the Hoo-Mins . That 's your first puzzle solved . Hoo-Mins , or rather H-Mns , is Centipedish , the language of centipedes . They mainly use signals , but they can crackle very faintly to one another , and when they dothere are no vowel sounds . So you must realize at once that their real names could n't be Harry and George . That 's just what I call them . Their real , Centipedish names were Hxzltl and Grnddjl . Go on . Try to say them . Try to say your own name without the a 's , e 's , i 's , o 's , and u 's ( I 'll let you keep the y 's ) and you 'll be talking Centipedish . I must just add that of course centipedes do n't have words for a lot of things that they do n't know much about , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . You 'll find a lot of these centi-descriptions in this story . I 'm sure you 'll be able to work them out , but I 'll just give you a couple of examples . ( Do n't worry -- the story 's going to start at any minute ! ) Hoo-Mins are the enemies of centipedes . But they have others . There are also hairy-biters ( which is anything hairy that bites ) , flying-swoopers ( birds , of course , plus maybe bats ) , and belly-crawlers . No prizes for guessing that one -- it 's snakes . But Hoo-Mins are in a category all by themselves . The category of the fastest , biggest , and scariest things around . Harry and George lived underground in earth-tunnels , which are nice and damp ( it 's very important to centipedes not to Dry Out ) , and came up at night to hunt . You 'll soon find out that their favorite foods were not things that you 'd fancy . When they were younger , they were centis , which are child centipedes . But now they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belinda . Belinda was Harry 's mother and George 's adopted mother . Her Centipedish name -- are you ready for this ?  - -  was Bkvlbbchk . Belinda was getting quite old now , though she could still give a toad or a beetle a run for its money -- it was just the very fast things like lizards and mice she had trouble with . So Harry and George did some of her hunting for her . They 'd had lots of cuticle-rippling adventures and feeler-close escapes , but they always managed to get back home in the end . So she 'd decided to stop poison-claw-clicking , which is how mother centipedes nag , and let them have their freedom . " Just take care , " she would beg , as they headed out of their home tunnels up into the dark-time . " We 'll be all right , Mama , " Harry would say as he chased after George , who still usually led the way . " We 'll bring you back something delicious for end-of-dark-time meal ! " So , on this night ( night -- dark-time -- okay ? ) , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goodies beside them . These included a couple of slugs , three assorted caterpillars , one large rhinoceros beetle -- which had put up quite a fight but they 'd overpowered it in the end -- and a mouse . This was their big prize because they knew Belinda loved a tasty bit of mouse before she went to sleep for the bright-time . All right , I 'll help you out this time -- the day . " Mama will be really pleased with us , " Harry said contentedly as they lay there resting , feeling the pale , un-hot light of white ball shining down on them . It was n't a full ball tonight or they would have scuttled underground to escape it -- they did n't like too much light , being night creatures . " Apart from the beetle , though , " mused George , " we ca n't say any of it was very exciting . " He did n't seem to be enjoying the rest . Half his twenty-one segments were off the ground and he was waving his feelers around in all directions . " Why do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " We 've got enough food . Do you want a snack ? " " No , " said George . " So what are you questing around for ? " George did n't answer . He dropped to his forty-two feet and took off without another crackle . Harry was feeling rather lazy after his night 's hunting and for once he did n't follow . He pretty well guessed what George had gone after . It was n't food . He 'd sensed the Something Else . The Something Else was a centeena . Yes , George was into girls . Girl-centipedes , that is . Only Harry did n't feel quite ready for all that yet . So he gave a centipedish sigh , laid his head on the good , warm earth , and waited . Harry loved the no-top-world . It was so full of interesting smells and sounds . Of course he knew it could be dangerous . Apart from Hoo-Mins , which did n't usually hunt at night , there were all those flying-swoopers and hairy-biters and belly-crawlers that I told you about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he was a young centi , Hoo-Mins had pushed a cloud of white-choke down into the centipedes ' tunnels and nearly killed . . . Continues ...
