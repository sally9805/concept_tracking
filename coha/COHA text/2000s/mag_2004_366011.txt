You 've heard of killing with kindness ? Dr. Gregory House ( Hugh Laurie ) believes in curing with contempt . He is a gifted diagnostician who is fascinated by disease . But patients he can do without . He insults them , talks down to them and forgets their names  --  when he speaks to them at all . " How can you treat someone without meeting him ? " asks a patient 's father . " It 's easy , " he says , " if you do n't give a crap about him . " <P> House is , in other words , the opposite of what a TV doctor is supposed to be  --  and the most enjoyable new character of the fall . Without him , House ( Fox , Tuesdays , 9 p.m . E.T. ) could have been a bland disease-of-the-week exercise like NBC 's stultifying Medical Investigation . Every week House and the staff at a New Jersey university hospital treat a different mystery illness . But House is working under protest , forced by his hospital administrator ( Lisa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actual patients face to face . Hobbled by an excruciating leg condition , he pops Vicodin like Tic Tacs as he suffers hypochondriacs with the sniffles . ( He does connect with a bitter office worker trying to milk her insurance before she gets fired ; admiring her spite , he orders up an expensive , unnecessary scan . ) <P> Laurie , a British actor known for playing comic twits , transforms flawlessly into an American jerk . ( In both accent and attitude he 's a little like Survivor 's Richard Hatch . ) His brilliant , arrogant lead is buffered by a likable confidant ( Robert Sean Leonard ) and three young doctors ( Omar Epps , Jennifer Morrison and Jesse Spencer ) who hold patients ' hands for him . The show also sports CGI effects that , CSI-style , bring us nose-to-cell with platelets and parasites . But unlike CSI , House is more interested in ideas than technology : Is the human touch overrated ? Are concepts like " death with dignity " just feel-good lies ? Funny , probing and unsentimental , House may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ER 's Dr. Carter . But as an honest look at techno-medicine and the prerogatives of genius , it 's a tonic .  --  By James Poniewozik
