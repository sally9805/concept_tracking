In fact , many women feel hornier while pregnant , which may have to do with extra blood flow to the pelvic area . " Is Natural Childbirth Best ? " Not necessarily . Natural childbirth means a woman goes through labor minus any drugs to quell the pain . Many moms-to-be think this makes labor less problematic , but no evidence shows that forgoing drugs produces healthier babies or easier deliveries , says Dr. Reichman .

" What 's the Afterbirth ? " This is the placenta , a temporary organ joining the uterus and the fetus , which supplies the fetus with blood and nutrients . After the infant is delivered , this 8-inch-across organ needs to come out too . " Delivering the placenta is uncomfortable , but some women do n't even notice it , " says Dr. Stone ; .
