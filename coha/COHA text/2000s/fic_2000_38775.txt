New technologies always bring new wrinkles on old problems . Here 's a story that takes the current cell phone craze a bit farther-with wild results . ( But is the technology all that new ? Mr. Heller notes that a student of William James 's by the name of Edmund Jacobson was playing around with electrical potentials in the larynx and - the inner voice " back in 1927 . ) Rick Heller is a computer programmer who lives in the Boston area . He confesses that his job gives him access to such military secrets as the US Marine Corps 's recipe for pizza burgers . This story is his first published work . <p> HOW 'S THIS FOR AN AD FOR Telepathy(TM) ? " You 're bound and gagged in the trunk of a car . The guy behind the wheel is going to kill you . You ca n't scream . You ca n't move . What do you do ? just think the words , " WellCell on , WellCell Dial 911 Dial . " Your call will be instantly transmitted to the local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's what the commercial would say . But what if the jeremy who kidnapped you removed the transmitter from your neck before he stuffed you in the trunk ? That 's what happened to me and to Gwen , my best friend . No , I do n't think Wells Cellular is going to be using me in their ads any time soon . Especially since it was a bug in their software that got me in trouble in the first place . It 's funny . I 'd pestered my mom . " Gwen 's mother says she can have Telepathy . Why ca n't P " The whining got me nowhere . Then Dad said he 'd pay for it , so I could call home in case of an emergency . Dr. Feinberg installed jacks in my ears and neck . She numbed the areas first with these medicated patches . I was awake the whole time . The ear jacks , she told me , connect to a nerve that runs from the ear to the brain . The neck jack connects to a nerve that goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A couple of weeks after the surgery , Gwen and I went back to Dr. Feinberg to get our chips . You plug them into the jacks to make Telepathy " work . Wearing them does n't look dooby at all , because they 're hidden inside jewelry . I chose a pair of turquoise and silver earrings to hold the ear chips , and a matching choker for my neck . I like to wear turquoise ; it looks fab with my blonde hair . Gwen has chestnut-brown hair . She picked gold earrings with a swirly kind of design , and for the neckpiece , a 24-karat gold brooch . Hers were maximum expensive . I do n't mind that her family has more money than mine , though . I get two looks from guys for every one that she gets . That 's more important than money . Telepathy(TM) did take some getting used to . When you hear another person 's thoughts , they sound like they come from inside you . It was tricky telling my thoughts apart from Gwen 's , at first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The chips are mini cell phones , basically . You can call other people with Telepathy- or even people with regular phone numbers . They were working great , until the day Gwen went to a cookout with her parents . The cookout had something to do with her father 's business . I sat around my house , snacking too much , while Gwen gave me the play-byplay . " Oh , God , you wo n't believe this , " Gwen was thinking . " There 's this ancient woman wearing a red bikini . She 's sitting at the edge of the pool with her feet in the water . The way her skin is hanging down from her stomach - it reminds me of making pizza - you know , the way dough hangs when you 're stretching it . " " Dooby ! " I thought . " Ever hear of a " tummy tuck ' ? " " Are you still in Brazil ? " " Brazil ? What do you mean ? " I thought . " You 're in L.A. ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gwen ! " " You 're not making any sense , Denyssa . " " Neither are you , " I thought . " No , I do n't think getting together would be a good idea . " " Gwen , are you being weird ? I ca n't take this . I 'm going for a swim . Talk to you later . WellCell Off . " " WellCell " is a keyword . It tells the chip to listen for an instruction . That 's so you do n't make a call by accident . Like if " chocolate " was a keyword , you 'd make a call every time you thought of Dove Bars . I changed into a black bikini , proud that my belly was nearly flat . I popped my chips out and laid them on the bureau . They 're " waterresistant " but not waterproof , which means you wo n't get electrocuted if you go in the pool with them , but they might not work as well afterward . I swam laps , then floated on my back for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like I 'd lost my voice - like I had laryngitis . It 's amazing that the chips can read your mind . Dr. Feinberg called it " inner voice recognition . " The brain 's sending signals to the vocal cords , she said , even when you 're thinking to yourself . It 's a very tiny amount , much less than when you 're actually talking , but enough for the chips to figure out what 's going on in your head . I dried myself off , went back inside , popped the chips back in and called Gwen . " WellCell On , " I thought . " WellCell Speed Dial One Dial . " Gwen answered . " Thank God you called . I 'm so bored . I 'm counting the number of times the word " fiduciary " has come up in conversation . I 'm at five . " We chatted for maybe a half-hour . " If you were stuck on a desert island , " I asked her , " and there could only be one store , what would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why are you calling me again ? " Her answer did n't make sense . " Gwen , are you fantasizing about some guy ? " I thought . " Denyssa , where did you get ...... The rest was garbled . " Gwen , it 's maximum strange . It 's like I 'm hearing two conversations at once . I 'm hearing you and someone else . " " I 'm not hearing anybody else , " Gwen thought . " Maybe there 's a problem with your chips . " " I thought we hashed this out . " " Did you just say , " I thought we hashed this out ? ' " " No . It was n't me . But it sounds - " " Gwen , will you shut up for a second so I can listen ? " I was hearing one side of a conversation , in spurts . Sometimes I 'd hear something . Sometimes there 'd be silence . " Oh , dinner at Koka 's . It 's tempting , but I 'd have to say no . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Some guy named Arturo just asked this woman to Koka 's , " I thought . " And she turned him down . " " I would die to be taken to Koka's. just lay my body out on the dessert table . " That was obviously Gwen thinking . " I do n't believe you can change . Because you 're Arturo Jansen , you think you can have any woman you want . " " You 're not going to believe this , " I thought . " She said , " Because you 're Arturo Jansen , you think you can have any woman you want . " " " The Arturo Jansen ? " " How many could there be ? " I heard this shriek inside my head . Was it her or me ? It was both of us . " He was so awesome in " Poker Player , " " Gwen thought . " The way he beat up that loan shark .... The woman Arturo was talking to kept turning him down , again and again . Meanwhile . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closet of Hollywood Weekly . I found Arturo among the " new faces to watch " in the March issue . Arturo had these incredible hazel eyes with dark lashes , and dark brown hair that reached to his shoulders . He was pictured with his girlfriend , a slender blonde named Palma Horvath . According to the article , his next role was as an air cavalry officer in the remake of Apocalypse Now . It was going to be filmed in Brazil . " He 's the Sun ! " I thought . " He 's beyond the Sun , " Gwen thought . " I bet Palma 's the one he 's talking to right now . " " How could anyone turn down a date with Arturo ? It 's not possible , " Gwen thought . " Denyssa , are you making this up ? " " Swear to God ! " " All right , Arturo . I 'll meet you at the door at Koka 's at seven tonight ! " " Hold on . Palma just gave in , " I thought . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't believe a word you 're saying , " Gwen thought . it was just Gwen and me now . The other conversation was over . " I can prove it , " I thought . " Tell your parents you 're coming over to my house tonight , and we 'll go to Koka 's . " " Koka 's wo n't take our reservation . " " I did n't mean that . We 'll stake out the parking lot . " We squealed again in unison . This was going to be so icy ! Gwen came over and picked me up in the Thunderbird her parents gave her for a birthday present . We got to Koka 's a few minutes before seven . Since it was summer , there was still plenty of daylight left . Koka 's had valet service , so we did n't even try to park there . The medical building next door had a parking lot that was practically empty . Gwen found a spot that looked out toward the restaurant , but was shielded by bushes . We took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was on duty when Palma Horvath pulled up in a new Packard . She was blonde and willowy , exactly like the photo . A guy met her at the door . It was so quick , I hardly got a chance to focus before they were gone . I took a snapshot with the bino-camera , though , and we examined the image . " It 's Arturo , all right , " Gwen said . " I will never doubt you again . " " What do you want to do now ? " " Let 's wait till they come out , " Gwen said . " Okay . " We split a pack of M &M's; while we waited . Gwen said , " I hope he does n't get back together with her . I want him for myself . When I have an apartment of my own , I see him coming to the door with a heart-shaped box of chocolate - it 's Valentine 's Day - and a dozen red roses . " " No , Gwen . We 're going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Arturo , dressed in a tuxedo , but you 're just wearing sweatpants , because he 's come to pick me up . He 's taking me to the Academy Awards , where he 's been nominated . I 'm wearing this beautiful red dress with slits down the sides . He wins the best actor award , and leans over and kisses me . The cameras focus on me , Denyssa Reilly , and I appear on TV all around the world . " " Fat chance , " Gwen said . " You 'd be such a fashion casualty that everyone in the world would flip the channel . " We had so much fun imagining our lives together with Arturo , we almost missed seeing Palma Horvath call for her car . it was like threequarters of an hour after she arrived . We waited to see if Arturo would join her , but she drove off alone . Arturo did n't come for his car for another fifteen or twenty minutes . Gwen started up her Thunderbird . " I 'm going to follow him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get back on-line . Maybe I ran hear something . " Gwen and I had tobe on-line for me to hear anything . I figured this out earlier , when Gwen called me up , and I immediately started hearing some guy talking to Arturo about a script . It was clear the conversation had been going on for a while . So even though we were sitting next to each other in her Thunderbird , we got on-line . My father would think it extravagant , but so what - he 's got a lot of money . We followed Arturo 's red Saab convertible from about half a block behind . Gwen went through two red lights in order to keep up . Once he got onto Santa Monica Boulevard , he made a call . " Arturo ! Have n't heard from you in a while , hombre . " Obviously , he was n't speaking to Palma . " Rio 's great . Especially around Carnival. , " Then there was a lull , and then I heard , " Oh , that 's too bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? How much ? ... Okay . I got ta make another stop first .... I 'll be over at your place around nine . Ciao . " " Blue Death . Is n't that some kind of synthetic ? " I asked Gwen . " Yeah . " " Someone 's making a dominos at Arturo 's tonight . " " It 's icy to know a star 's secrets , " Gwen thought . " Yeah . It 's like we 're his best friends , and he 's telling us stuff . " We followed him all the way home . We saw him turn into a driveway . By the time we passed by , the gates were closing . " Why do n't I pull over ? " Gwen thought . " He 's probably in for the night . Besides , his friend 's coming over and might spot us . Why do n't we come back tomorrow ? " So that 's what we did . We followed him for the next several evenings . It was funny . For a movie star , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you could 've said that about us too . But Gwen and I were teenagers . We had an excuse . One night , we followed him to a residential area near U.C.L.A. He suddenly pulled over . We were afraid he 'd seen us . We kept on going . If he saw us , he did n't mention it when he called Palma . " No , Arturo . You have to learn to let go , " she said . " You could meet someone tomorrow . I 'm not that special , believe me . " " What 's wrong with her ? " Gwen thought . " He 's so dreamy . " We followed him the next evening , this time staying far back . When we got to this one intersection , he went through a yellow light . It turned red before we got to it . " Go through it , Gwen , " I thought . Cars started across from the other direction . Gwen screamed , and slammed on the brakes . " Sorry , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then I caught a very brief exchange between Palma and Arturo . " Do n't come over here ! " she said . " This is starting to get weird , Arturo . You need to go back to your therapist . " Then she hung up . " He called Palma again , " I thought . " She 's through with him . " " You know , we came this way last night , " Gwen thought . " I bet I could find where he went . Look for a Dandelion Donuts . That 's where we turn . " Sure enough , after a mile or two , there was a Dandelion Donuts . Gwen swung a hard right . It was a residential street , and we continued on it for several blocks . There was Arturo 's Saab , parked haphazardly in front of a beige house with purple shutters . " VoilA ! " Gwen thought . We parked a discreet distance away , and waited . Arturo came out of the house about a half an hour later . He looked around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Saab . We slumped down . " Do you think he saw us ? " I thought . " I hope not . " By the time we sat up again , he 'd disappeared . " Sure you can come over , " I heard a voice say . " He 's not going home , Gwen , " I thought . " What kind of problem ? ... You can count on me , hombre .... I 'll back you up . I 'm your loyal puppy , Arturo . I only shit on your newspaper . " I laughed when I heard that line . I relayed it to Gwen and she put a finger down her throat . We went to Ollie 's Pizza afterward . While we were waiting for our food , Gwen kicked me under the table and said , " I 'm your loyal puppy , Denyssa . I only shit on your newspaper . " When the cute waiter came with the pizza , I told him , " We 're loyal puppies . We shit only on your placemats . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were dooby . The next day was weird . I was having dinner by the TV , watching " Tunesville . " At the news break , they said that the body of Palma Horvath had been found . She 'd been stabbed multiple times with her own kitchen knives . Hearing about a murder is a great appetite suppressant . They showed the picture of the house , and it was the beige one with the shutters we 'd seen Arturo come out of . I immediately called Gwen and told her to turn on the TV . " I bet he killed her , " I thought . " Bullshit . It was some burglar . " " He was there last night . " " Well , thank God he did n't spend the night with her or he 'd be dead too . " " I bet you he did it . " " You are so wrong , Denyssa . " We followed the story religiously over the next few days . The police said they had no leads , but did n't think it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at approximately 9:30 P.m. on the night before the body was discovered . " He did it ! " I thought . " That 's exactly when we saw him at the house . " " Wrong ! Itwas like 8:57 orsomething . It certainly was n't after nine . " " Close enough , " I thought . " Does n't prove anything . " " That guy , C.J. , said they were together all evening . We know that 's not true . He 's the loyal puppy . " Gwen had no comeback . I was sure I 'd won the point . But I wished I knew what she was thinking . You see , having Telepathy(TM)does n't mean you can hear every single word someone thinks . God , no ! Gwen and I would have had so many fights . Dr. Feinberg said there 's an " inhibitory circuit " wired from the nerves to the chips . I do n't understand it , but basically , you have to want your thoughts to go out . " He could n't have done anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit of silence . " Arturo 's not like that . " " We do n't know him , " I thought . I could n't believe she was still defending the guy . " Maybe that 's the problem , " Gwen thought . " He must be feeling terribly lonely without Palma . We know how much he wanted to be with her . " " Well , she did n't want to be with him . " " He needs some support now . Someone to lean on . " I laughed . " He 's got C.J. ! " " He needs a woman , Denyssa . " " Who do you have in mind ? " " Me , of course . But I 'd want you to come along too . " " What if he fell in love with me and not you , " I thought . " Palma was blonde . " " He might be in the mood for a brunette now . " " This is the doobiest idea you 've ever come up with , Gwen . This guy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wish you 'd stop saying that . If he 's a murderer , how come he has n't been arrested ? " " I do n't know . " " Of course you do n't . Well , I 'm going to find some way to meet him , whether you come with me or not . " I did n't know what to do . It seemed like a bad idea . But Gwen was my best friend . I could be totally wrong about Arturo . And if he was dangerous , she 'd be better off with me by her side , watching out for her . I always end up giving in to Gwen . We spent days plotting how to meet Arturo . uWe could ram his car with your Thunderbird , " I suggested . Gwen did n't like that idea . Then I overheard a conversation between Arturo and his agent . " I was having lunch with a producer who 's a trustee of Children 's Hospital of Pasadena , " the agent said , " They 're having a benefit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ This would be good for you , Arturo .... There 's sympathy out there for you because of Palma 's passing . By raising your profile tastefully - I 'm talking tastefully - we may give you a shot at some leading roles . " That 's where we ended up meeting Arturo - at a charity event . Arturo put on a mime act for the kids . He made believe he was a lion , then an elephant , and then a seal . He made those poor kids so happy for an afternoon . " He 's adorable , " Gwen whispered to me . Later , there was a crush of people hoping to get his autograph . We knew we only had a few seconds to make an impression . I 'M , " Gwen said . " We love your movies . " Thanks . " " We 're sorry about Palma , " I said . " Thank you . " " We 're your greatest fans . We know everything , " Gwen said . " And we love you . " Gwen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a love letter signed by the two of us . It contained both our Telepathy " numbers . Gwen lowered her voice to a whisper , " You could even say we 're your loyal puppies , and we only shit on your newspaper . " Arturo 's eyes widened . He looked like he was about to say something , but the big shots at the hospital made us move on . An hour later , though , after we had arrived back at Gwen 's house , she got a telepathy call . She did n't say anything , but I could tell from her expression she was talking to someone . " It 's Arturo , " Gwen shrieked . " He wants to know if we want to party ! " We both screamed . I did n't know what I was getting myself mixed up in , but it was hard not to be excited . We arrived at Arturo 's at twilight . At the gate , we did n't even have to press a button . The camera focused on the driver 's side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Gwen and Denyssa . " The gate swung open . The house was two stories , with whitewashed walls and a red-tile roof . Arturo appeared at the door in shorts and a yellow T-shirt . He was barefoot . Gwen parked on the red brick patio . Gwen had on a blue halter top and a Giverny miniskirt . I wore a little black dress and sheer black nylons . We strutted up to the door . " Hi , Arturo . " " Come on in . " We stepped inside . " Denyssa , can you believe itl " Gwen thought . " We 're hanging with a movie star ! " " This is maximum icy . Even if he is a murderer , he 's a gorgeous one . " We were on-line with each other , so we could make comments without Arturo overhearing us . We followed him to a small room that looked out onto the garden . " This is the living room , " Arturo said . " I love it , " Gwen said . " You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on Arturo 's love seat . " Where are you guys from ? " " We 're not in high school , Denyssa ! " Gwen thought . " We share an apartment in West Hollywood , " I said . " Do you want a beer ? " " That would be great , " Gwen said . He disappeared into the kitchen . " Did you see the look he gave me ? " Gwen thought . " He was undressing me . " " I got the same look , " I thought . " it lasted longer . " " You 're such a liar . " Arturo returned , carrying a tray with three bottles of beer and three tall glasses . He opened each bottle and poured the beer into a glass . As he handed me a glass , he told me , " You are a beautiful woman . " I felt flushed . " He thinks I 'm beautiful , " I thought . " And you are exquisite , " he said to Gwen . " I 'd rather be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . " I 'm a big fan of yours , " Gwen said . " I 'm a huge fan . I 've seen all your movies , " I added . " I 'm the bigger fan , " Gwen said . " The poster I have in my room is bigger than Denyssa 's . " " You 're quite a pair . " Arturo smiled . " That line you used with the puppies , how did that go ? " " We 're your loyal puppies . We only shit on your newspaper , " Gwen said . " I like it . Did you hear it from somebody , or did you make it up yourself ? " " It 's a line from a movie , " Gwen said . " Was n't it in The Godfather ? " " Gwen , you are so stupid , " I said . " It 's from 101 Dalmatians . " No , you 're stupid . It was definitely The Godfather . " " Now , ladies . It does n't really matter . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did you mean by that ? That you 've read all about me in the fan magazines ? " " Oh , we know more than that , " Gwen said . " But we would never tell anyone , " I added . " Please do n't leave me in suspense , " Arturo said . " We overhear your Telepathy , " Gwen said . " That 's how we heard about loyal puppies. it 's not really a line from The Godfather . " Arturo nervously placed his glass down on the end table . He looked stunned . " You overhear my Telepathy ? " " Gwen ca n't hear anything . Only I can . " Arturo shook his head . " If you do n't believe us , try calling the guy you get your drugs from , " Gwen said . " You know about that too ? " Arturo fell silent . Then he cracked a smile . " Wait a second . Did C.J. put you up to this ? " " We 've never met him , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'll call C.I . right now . " I heard C.J. answer , " How are you doing , hombre ? " I repeated , " How you doing , hombre ? " I do n't know what Arturo asked him , but C.J. answered , " I screwed six women in five days . " I laughed . " He said he screwed six women in five days . " " Holy shit , " Arturo said audibly . Arturo wrapped up the conversation with CJ . Then he asked me , " How do you do this ? " " I do n't know , " I said . " I guess there 's something wrong with my chip . " " Do n't worry , " Gwen said . " We respect your privacy . " " I guess I should feel thankful for that . " " We know about you being at Palma 's that last night , " Gwen said . " See , we 've been following you . But we 're loyal , just like C.J. " Arturo got up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women ca n't keep a secret . They have to tell their friends . " " We tell our secrets to each other , " I said . Gwen nodded in agreement . " A lot of people might even pay for stories about me . " " Do n't worry , " I said . " Our families are rich . We do n't need money . " " What do you want , then ? " " We want to be with you , " Gwen said . " You did n't tell your friends you were partying with me tonight ? " " No , " I said . " Your parents ? " " Nobody , " Gwen said . " We understand the meaning of the word confidential . " Arturo squeezed in between us on the love seat . He put his arms around us . " Okay . You can hang with me as long as you keep it quiet . " Then he kissed each of us on the lips . I felt my legs go soft . We drank some more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we were feeling maximum comfortable . I was wondering if he was going to have sex with both of us together . We 'd never done that before . Instead he asked us , " Do you guys want to do some Blue Death ? " " Gwen , " I thought . " What do we say ? " " Sure , " Gwen said . Arturo opened a bottle of champagne , and poured it into fluted glasses . He mixed in a blue powder . " You have to drink it all at once . " Arturo watched us as we both downed our glasses . Before I finished it , I felt sweaty . Then , major nausea . I do n't know how much time passed while I was out of it . The next thing I 'm sure of , I felt a jolt . I was thrown against something hard . My neck hurt - I mean , really hurt . I was alert now , though I still felt dizzy . I could feel a warm body at my side , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't moving at all . We were in some sort of dark chamber . There was music though , loud Razor music - I 'm not sure which band - coming from all around . I tried to speak , but I could n't open my mouth . Something was covering it . I could n't tell what it was , because I could n't move my arms . I could n't move my legs either , for that matter . I tried Telepathy " . " WeIlCell on , " I thought . But for the first time , I did n't hear a dial tone . God damn it , I thought . What 's wrong with this ? " WellCell on . WellCell on . " My Telepathy " A was n't working ! I could n't believe it . I lay there for a while , confused . I assumed I was hallucinating , but as time went on , I became more and more certain I was n't . The second jolt convinced me . Earthquake ! We 're trapped under debris . Either that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a car . There was a bump , and then another bump . There was a whole series of them . This was like no earthquake I 'd ever felt . We were in the trunk of a moving car . I suddenly felt a chill . We 're such idiots , I thought . Arturo drugged us and then stuffed us in the trunk of his car . He 's going to murder us , just like he did Palma . " WellCell on . WellCell on . " But it would n't come on . Sobbing , I struggled to free my arms . They were bound with sticky stuff , maybe duct tape or something . There was a ragged end , and I got it started . I was able to unwind it to the point where I could separate my hands . Ha , I thought . Arturo 's character in Deadbeat would have tied a better knot . Once my hands were free , I ripped the tape off my mouth . Ouch ! I shook Gwen , and peeled the tape off her mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my God . Maybe she 's dead , I thought . Lying on my side , I brought my knees up to my chest , and unwound the tape from my legs . As I flicked the tape off my fingers , I happened to touch my throat . All I felt was skin . My choker was gone , and with it , my Telepathy- chip . I went insane . I kicked wildly . I tried to break the trunk lock , but broke a heel instead . My new black pumps - trashed , and I did n't even care . I clawed at the lining of the bottom of the trunk . I was hoping it was n't metal underneath , and I could tunnel my way out . I tugged at the fabric until it ripped . Good , I thought . At least if Arturo kills us , he 'll have to get his trunk reupholstered . I grabbed onto some electrical wires . That 's when I remembered something I learned from a TV movie . That little lever next to the driver 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wire that runs from the lever to the lock . If you break the wire , the lock opens . That 's what I did . I kept tugging and tugging until I heard a pop . I gave the trunk lid a gentle nudge , and it gave way . I looked back at Gwen and gave her a shove . There was no sign of life . I knew if I did n't jump now , I was dead . If I tried to drag her along , we 'd be caught , and we 'd both be dead . My best chance , and Gwen 's , was for me to get help on my own . I sprang up , lifting open the trunk lid , and jumped out . I fell onto what was a dirt road . I rolled downhill for fifteen or twenty feet , and came to a halt underneath a bush . I was all scratched up . I felt something sticky on my lips . Oh , my God , I thought . I 'm bleeding . My shoes were gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where the hell I was , except I was in my stocking feet in the middle of a wilderness . I was in some kind of canyon , probably in one of the California State Parks . I could see in the dark easily , thanks to having been in the trunk for so long . There was a hill over to my right outlined against a hazy glow . I figured that was probably the street lights of L.A. reflecting in the smog . I was n't sure if I could walk , but when I heard the Saab screech to a halt and shift into reverse , I decided to run . I plunged into the bushes . There were no trees to hide behind , but there was plenty of scrub brush . After I had gotten away from the dirt road , I shifted from speedy to sneaky mode . I went down on my hands and knees , and crawled through the brush as quietly as I could . As the ground started sloping upward , I got up off my knees into a crouch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't scream , though . I do n't know how I avoided it ; usually , if I got a paper cut , I 'd be babbling about it with Gwen for ten minutes . I heard the throbbing of an engine . Peeking through the scrub , I saw the car , its headlights pointing back down the road . He 'd turned the Saab around . Arturo was out of the car , peering into the darkness . The red tail lights reflecting off his face made him look like the psycho in Slit Skirt . And to think I liked that movie ! As I continued up the hill , I kept telling myself not to stand up when I reached the top ; he 'd be able to spot me against the smoggy glow of L.A. I crawled on my belly the last ten feet . By the time I was safely on the other side , my dress was all slimy . I could now see a line of houses along a ribbon that might have been a county road . There was a smaller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wondered if the dirt road branched off of that . I bounded down the hill until I slipped and nearly sprained my ankle . As I stopped to rub my ankle , I looked back toward the top , dreading the moment when Arturo would appear . But there was no sign of him . Iwas feeling happy as I limped down the hill . Gimp or not , I was going to live . At the base , I pushed my way through the last stretch of brush . Then I saw a fence . At first , I thought it was barbed wire . It was n't , but then I wondered , what if it 's electrified ? I pictured my hair frizzing up like Ms. Frankenstein . I touched the fence lightly , expecting a jolt . It felt a little damp , but otherwise perfectly harmless . I was being paranoid . You get that way after you 've been kidnapped . So there I was climbing a fence in my little black dress . if that was n't enough to make me feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it , the fence post keeled over and I flipped forward onto the ground . This is hell , I thought , as I lay sprawled on the soft grass . Am I that much of a moo ? I lifted myself up , and jogged across the grass . A spotlight flicked on , set off by a motion detector . With the light in my eyes , I dashed past the pool and the car port and across the small front yard . I scrambled up a flight of redwood steps to the front door . The house was dark . I rang the bell but there was no answer . I rang it again and pounded on the window pane , trying to make as big a racket as I could . Nothing . I needed to get to a phone . I stepped back down to the front yard . Neighboring homes also seemed to be dark . What time was it , I wondered . Had everyone gone to bed ? One house across the road seemed to have a light on . I stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the distance . Its lights were very bright . Was it Arturo , searching for me ? I backed away from the road and decided to break into the house . I looked around the yard for something I could use . There was a planter , but it looked too heavy for me . Then I noticed a wooden stake with a sign hanging from it . It said , " The Silva 's . " I gave the stake a good tug . That loosened it , and with a second yank , the stake came out of the earth . The headlights were getting nearer . I raced to the picture window , dragging the stake behind me . I was about to shatter the glass when the car pulled into the driveway , its lights blinding me . I 'm dead , I thought . I was so close to being alive . A man stepped out of the still-running car . In a booming voice , he said , " What are you doing on the Silva 's property ? " Whoever it was , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I did n't know what he sounded like in person . Well , I figured , if it was C.J. I was dead , but if it was anyone else , I should be honest . " I need a phone , " I said . " I 've been kidnapped . " The man walked closer to me . He was in uniform . He had a nightstick and a communicator , but I did n't see a gun . " Kidnapped ? " " Yeah . My friend is still kidnapped . He 'll kill her if I do n't save her . " I might have sounded a little spacey because of the Blue Death . " It looks like you 're breaking and entering . Is n't that really what 's going on ? " " I do n't care if you believe me . Arrest me . I want to be arrested . " He said nothing . " You 're not a real cop . " Another car pulled into the driveway . A man climbed out . He had a baseball cap pulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was . " There you are , " Arturo said . " Do n't let him near me ! " " I 'm sorry , sir . My niece has been abusing drugs , " Arturo said . " That 's clear , " said the security guard . " Her parents sent her to stay with me to keep her away from bad influences . " Arturo spoke with a foreign accent - it was some sort of actor 's trick . " She ran away . I 'll take her back now . " " Do n't let him take me ! " I screamed . " She 's yours , " the security guard said . " Do n't let this happen again . Of Arturo grabbed my wrist , and pulled me toward the Saab . I screamed . I lunged at the security guard and tried to take his nightstick . I grabbed it , but he was stronger than me . He pushed me down to the ground . So I bit him . " Crazy bitch , " he said , pinning me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this , " Arturo said . " Deeply ashamed . I 'll put her right to bed . " I struggled to get away , but I was overpowered . I started sobbing . The next thing I knew , I was in handcuffs . First duct tape and now this , I thought . Shackled twice in one night ! " I 'm going to call this in . " The guard pulled out his communicator . " This bitch belongs in an institution . " Under the circumstances , those were the sweetest words I could imagine . Arturo touched me on the shoulder . " Do n't worry , honey . I 'm going to get you a lawyer . " With that , he got in his car and peeled away . I was booked for assaulting the security guard and attempting to get his weapon . They took my fingerprints . Thank God they do n't use ink anymore . I was dirty enough after a night in the hills . I gave a statement describing everything that happened . I did n't leave anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because I wanted to be believed . I did n't care what my parents would say . I did n't care what happened to me . I only wanted them to get Arturo , and to save Gwen if that was still possible . When my father arrived , he was furious at me , for what I did , and for talking to the police without a lawyer . In the morning , I was brought in for more interrogation , this time with a lawyer . " I have some good news for you , " the detective said . He was in his mid-thirties , blond and good-looking . " Your friend Gwen 's all right . She 's fine . I was so happy . I broke into tears . " Is there anything in your earlier statement you 'd like to amend ? " he asked . " No , " I said , looking at Scheer , my lawyer . " Everything I said was the truth . " " Then we have a little problem . " " What sort of problem ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his forehead . " Not only is her friend all right , she tells an entirely different story . " " What did she say ? " I asked . " Look , Denyssa , if you tell the truth now , you wo n't be prosecuted for perjury . " " Everything I said was true . " " I would like to speak with my client privately , " Scheer said . " Ignore him . What did Gwen say ? " " She says she spent the night with Arturo Jansen . She says he never left the house at any time during the night , and that you were there early , but left on your own . " " That 's not true , " I said . " You 're lying . Gwen would n't have said that . " " We also have a statement by Arturo Jansen . His story jibes with hers . He says you were acting strange , and insisted on leaving around eleven P.m. on foot , despite his offer to drive you home or call a cab @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You admit you ingested diethylfedramine ? " " What 's that ? " " What you referred to as Blue Death . " My lawyer cast me a cautionary glance . " I admit it , " I said . " It 's the word of two people against one , and you 're not a very reliable witness . We 've also checked with Wells Cellular . They 're not aware of any problem with their Telepathy service such as you describe . " " I ca n't believe this . It did happen . I swear . " " Can you give us your chips ? We 'll test them . " " I told you . Arturo stripped them off of me . " The detective stared at me with his cold blue eyes . " You 're telling me that Arturo Jansen , your friend Gwen , and the phone company are all lying . Why do n't you admit that you were freaked out of your apple and were trying to break into the Silva residence ? " " What about the security guard ! He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a selection of photographs , including one of Mr. Jansen . He was unable to identify anyone . " They threatened to prosecute me for assault , breaking and entering , and lying under oath . Thanks to Scheer , I pled guilty only to a misdemeanor , for biting the security guard . I got off with probation and psychological counseling . The counselor helped a lot , especially when Hollywood Weekly did a profile on Gwen and Arturo . They were now a romantic duo and Gwen was now a blonde . It made me sick . Asked about rumors of Arturo 's involvement in Palma 's death , Gwen responded that Arturo was gentle and kind and was devastated by the murder . " There are always people willing to make up a nasty story , " Gwen said . I took a match to that issue and burned it . I was in school , in English class , when my teacher received a message on his monitor . He told me to go immediately to the principal 's office . My mother was waiting there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station . I called Scheer . " The crow 's feet by my mother 's eyes become obvious when she 's upset . " It 's time you get a part-time job to help us pay these legal bills of yours . " Scheer met us at the station house . Sgt. Reese , the cop who handled my case , sat us down in a conference room . " You told us a pretty crazy story a while back about hearing voices in your head , " Reese said . I kept my mouth shut . There was no use arguing . " You may be interested in this news item . " LOS ANGELES - Wells Cellular Corporation has corrected a software flaw which affected a small number of subscribers to its Telepathy " " service . In some circumstances , packets sent to one subscriber were being duplicated and sent to another . The flaw , which occurred only with rare combinations of Telepathy- numbers , has been corrected in the switching centers and will not require the recall of any chips released to the public . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't make it up . " My mother straightened the hem of her skirt . " Mothers make mistakes too . " Reese broke in . " It 's not like we never believed you . Arturo Jansen has always been a suspect in Palma Horvath 's murder . " Reese ran his fingers through his curly blond hair . " But we never had anything we could bring to a judge without being laughed out of the courtroom . Are you willing to testify in court about what happened to you on the night of your kidnapping ? " " Yes , and about the night Palma was murdered too . " " If you 'll stand by your statement , we can use it to get a warrant to search Mr. Jansen 's residence . Are you willing ? " " Totally ! " I said . I had the satisfaction of learning not long afterward that the " dreamy guy , " Arturo , had been arrested . The search netted fibers from his clothing that perfectly matched microscopic evidence found on Palma 's body . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 'll probably be broadcast in its entirety . I 'm not supposed to watch because I 'm a witness . Two weeks later , Gwen the traitor called me up - on the telephone . " Do you want to take the call ? " my mother asked . " I do n't want to speak to that bitch ! " " She says she wants to apologize . Why do n't you talk to her ? " I took the phone . " Hello , Benedictine Arnold . " " I 'm a jeremy . I admit it . I was totally wrong . I woke up in his bed that night , and I truly did not have any memory of being in the trunk . I was zoned . We made love , and it was fantastic . I asked where you were , and Arturo said you 'd gone home . " " You believed him ? " " He said you went home because he liked me better and you were jealous . I 'm sorry . " " So you lied for him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the police called , and we went down to make a statement , he told me what to say . The way I figured it , he needed me . What better dump insurance could I have ? " " Were n't you afraid of him ? " " Look , I did n't think he killed Palma . I was wrong . Besides , even if he had done it , I knew he could n't get away with killing two girlfriends in a row . And I really wanted to be with him . I am so sorry . " " What you say means nothing to me . " " I 'm testifying against him too , " Gwen said . " They gave me immunity . " I felt immense relief . I 'd dreaded taking the stand and having Arturo 's lawyer cross-examine me , using Gwen 's statement to make me into a liar . " I 'm really , totally sorry , " Gwen said . " Can we be friends again ? " " No ! What you did was rotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ summer after seventh grade ? Camp Coronado . You spent every moment with that boy from Phoenix . You totally ignored me . Then , when the fall came , you wanted to be friends again . I forgave you . " " What you did was worse . " " It was worse , but not all that different . " " It was three times as bad , " I said . " Two times . " " All right . Two times . " " So can I come over ? " It was a good thing Gwen could n't hear the names I called her in my head . Still , I find it hard to hold a grudge where Gwen is concerned . We go back all the way to first grade . " Yeah , " I said . " But you better bring something , and it better he chocolate . You are maximum going to make this up to me . " <p>
