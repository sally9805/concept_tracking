<p> Even with a Mediterranean breeze , the salty sea air feels thick enough to hold in one 's hand . The teenage runners , most of them barefoot , are hopping at the starting line  --  not to stay loose , but to keep their feet from being scorched by the steamy asphalt on one of Gaza City 's main thoroughfares . <p> Sanaa Abu Bkheet , 19 , one of the lucky few with training shoes , is running in what is scheduled to be her final race before heading to Athens to compete in the 800 meters as one of just two Palestinian Olympians . <p> Most of the kids are several years younger than Abu Bkheet ( pronounced buh-KEET ) , and the competition resembles a fun run for summer campers rather than a pre-Olympic tuneup . <p> Such are the conditions for Abu Bkheet , an athlete without a recognized country , a runner without a track to train on , a half-miler whose only formal race this year was in Iran in February . <p> With a personal best of 2 minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abu Bkheet will not be a medal contender at Athens . Her goal is simply to meet Maria Mutola , the Mozambican who has dominated the 800 for a decade , not to defeat her . <p> When she first started training seriously three years ago in her hometown of Deir al-Balah , eight miles south of Gaza City , Abu Bkheet was the target of stones and ridicule from boys who had never seen a girl running through the sandy streets of her traditional , conservative community . Her outfit  --  a T-shirt and shorts  --  was considered downright scandalous by some . <p> But Abu Bkheet 's mother , Amnah , a former athlete herself , and her father , Abed , a policeman , went door-to-door to inform neighbors that the lithe girl with the spring in her stride would be a regular sight on the rutted roads . Harassment has long since turned to encouragement , Abu Bkheet said , though there are still hardships aplenty . <p> " We still do n't have anywhere decent to train , and the competition is very limited , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translator . She works out daily with a group of about 15 boys and girls in a vacant lot near the beach . " We know we need to do things like lift weights . But for now , we just do a lot of simple exercises , like pushups and situps . " <p> One obstacle to becoming a top-flight track athlete in Gaza is that there is no track . The impoverished coastal territory , where 1.3 million Palestinians live , does have a dusty soccer field at Yarmouk Stadium in Gaza City . Soccer is the most popular sport among Palestinians , but on occasion , track officials mark off an oval and stage a race . <p> Here , Abu Bkheet first displayed her talent , though her school did not have organized sports for girls . <p> " We just went to competitions once in a while , " she said . " We never did any training . " <p> On a typical day , Abu Bkheet rises at 5 a.m. and downs a tablespoon of olive oil , to bring good health . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> In the afternoon , Abu Bkheet and her sister Wissam , 17 , walk about an hour to the empty lot where their coach , Sameer al-Nabaheen , has marked off a semicircle in the dirt and sand that allows them to run 200-meter intervals . <p> The ground is littered with rocks and burrs from the scrub brush . But Abu Bkheet did not have running shoes until a European television crew bought her a pair of Brooks trainers a few months ago after filming a story about her . <p> " Until then , I just ran barefoot , and my training partners still do n't have shoes , " she said . " I 'm faster barefoot , but you are always getting stickers in your toes . " <p> Her running career began shortly after the current round of Israeli-Palestinian fighting erupted in September 2000 . And her hometown , Deir al-Balah , has been the scene of clashes between Israeli security forces and Palestinian militants . <p> During periods of violence , the Israelis have often set up roadblocks on the main coastal road outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> On this day , Israeli troops are operating in the northern and southern ends of Gaza , and three Palestinians are killed in the fighting . <p> In the center of Gaza , the Israelis have lifted the roadblock on the coastal road for the first time in several days . This allowed Abu Bkheet to travel to Gaza City to compete in the road race . <p> " We struggle to give these boys and girls opportunities , " said Nabil Mabrouk , the president of Palestinian track and field . " We have no facilities and no budget . Sports means these kids have something to do , and they can stay out of trouble . If we open a track , we can close a prison . " <p> The limited athletic options for Palestinians have further contracted during the past four years of Mideast violence . Israel has imposed tough travel restrictions , and Gaza residents face many obstacles to leaving the territory , or even traveling inside it . Abu Bkheet has been relatively fortunate in getting at least a small taste of foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in addition to her trip to Iran . <p> Abu Bkheet left Gaza for Greece about a month before the Games to take part in a training program sponsored by the Greek government . <p> And although the Palestinians have not obtained statehood , the International Olympic Committee has allowed them to send a token team to the Summer Games since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority a decade ago . <p> The Palestinians sent one athlete to the 1996 Games in Atlanta , and two athletes , including a woman , to Sydney in 2000 , according to Palestinian Olympic officials . In Athens , Abu Bkheet will be joined by Raad Aweisat , a 17-year-old swimmer from the Jerusalem area who will compete in the 100-meter butterfly . <p> The Abu Bkheet family lives in a simple but well-kept cinderblock house , surrounded by date palms . The living room consists of a plastic table and chairs , a television set and few ornaments aside from the trophies and medals won by Abu Bkheet and Wissam , a 1,500-meter runner with a personal best of 5:06 . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girls and two boys  --  and her father had a stroke in January . Much of his monthly salary , a little more than $200 , now goes for his medicine , the family said . Reflecting the conservative society , Mrs. Bkheet wears an ankle-length , full-sleeve green dress and a mustard head scarf despite the summer heat . Abu Bkheet wears blue jeans , a short-sleeve top , gold earrings and a black-knit cap . When she trains , Abu Bkheet runs in tights that stretch just below the knee and a T-shirt . <p> She completed high school earlier this summer and plans to attend Al Aksa University in Gaza and continue training . Her goal is to crack the 2-minute barrier and join the elite athletes in her event for the Beijing Olympics in 2008 . <p> On this day , the road race begins next to the otherwise deserted parliament building in Gaza City . With the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat confined to the West Bank city of Ramallah for more than two years , there is little sign of the government 's presence in Gaza @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the runners set off . Abu Bkheet runs with a muscular , bouncy stride , without the practiced smoothness of an experienced runner . She easily finishes first among the girls , and behind a few boys , in a time of just over 9 minutes on a course stretching about a mile and a half . At the finish line , a boy with a hose cools down the blistered feet of the barefoot runners . <p> " I 'm more motivated when I can run against the boys , " Abu Bkheet said . " But it was very hot , and I prefer the distance I 'm used to . " <p> Mabrouk , the track and field president , looked on with admiration . " Sanaa is not world class yet , but she is our champion .
