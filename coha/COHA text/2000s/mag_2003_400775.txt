Feedback ? **25;1642;TOOLONG Headnote Skyrocketing property taxes are eating away at your home 's value Soon they might sink the broader housing market . by Shawn Tully // On a sweltering summer day in 1861 , Confederate General " Stonewall " Jackson met a fierce Union charge with a pulverizing counterpunch that sent a blue tide of troops , sans weapons , fleeing over a grassy ridge in northern Virginia . The escape route of the first Battle of Bull : Run passes the modest colonial-style house of state senator Ken Cuccinelli , a Civil War buff so ardent he ponders how Jackson obtained the leg- endary lemons he sucked in battle . Now Cuccinelli thinks his property is under siege again , not from marauding Rebs or Yanks , but from soaring property taxes . Outrage over the fiscal bayonets aimed at his home and hearth helped push Cuccinelli into politics as an antitax c " I have Stonewall 's fervor " he muses . " I hope I have his troop support . " It seems as though nothing can stop the majestic upward march of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Iraq . But homeowner beware ! The frothy market masks a big , creeping problem for the 77 million families who 've benefited from swelling prices and bank on more of the same . From New York City , where property taxes just jumped 18.5% in a single year , to tony Los Angeles suburbs , where the tax bill often triples when houses change handsfrom sprawling cities to sleepy hamlets-property taxes are rising relentlessly . This powerful , largely overlooked trend could turn the housing miracle as sour as Stonewall 's lemons . Property taxes are as American as Main Street . They 're the levies that fund your local services , from schools to police to parks . Why are property taxes , a.k.a. real estate taxes , jumping ? The answer is simple-and scary . In this strange economy , home prices are thriving while almost everything else is hurting . All other sources of revenue , from state aid to sales tax receipts , are flat or falling . But the pressure to keep spending ratcheting upward is enormous . So local governments are heaping more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ budget increases-which , by the way , are big-on the one strong pillar left standing : America 's houses . That means this revolution in municipal finance is target- Tk ing your ranch or saltbox . The rub is that the people who own those pillars and porches are n't seeing their in- z comes grow anywhere near as fast as their tax bills . " In this weak economy , taxes are rising far faster than people 's ability to pay them , " says Lewis Goodkin , a Miamibased real estate consultant . The danger : People will sell their houses because they can no longer afford the monthly charges , or pay less for a new abode because taxes are so high . Either way , rising property taxes could prove the weight that tips the seesaw , sending prices on a downward slope . It is n't happening yet , for a fundamental reason-bargain interest rates . Homeowners pay less than 6% on a 30year mortgage , the best deal in 40 years . For many Americans , interest payments have fallen even more than property taxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their house , the holy grail for any homeowner , is often actually falling . But let 's look forward . The housing market faces two substantial negatives . First , after gaining almost 20% in value in the past three years , America 's houses are extremely expensive . They resemble stocks whose P/Es stand far above their historic averages . From those lofty heights , they have little room for strong appreciation and are extremely vulnerable to more bad news-job losses , say , or worse , rising interest rates . Second , the rates supporting those sterling prices are already so low that they 're unlikely to fall much further . In fact , they 're more likely to rise as the economy rebounds . Then , watch out ! If that happens , the combination of higher taxes and ballooning interest payments will cause a big increase in the cost of owning a home . " So far , the effect of higher property taxes is getting washed out by falling rates , " says Mark Zandi , a housing expert at Economy com . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of taxes to drive down property values will become very apparent , very quickly . " Property taxes are no sideshow . The numbers are big-so big that , believe it or not , real estate taxes now rival mortgage payments as the largest expense for homeowners . Last year Americans paid $265 billion in interest on their houses . The bill for property taxes was $205 billion , according to a study of IRS records by Economy.com . So for every dollar homeowners pay in mortgage interest , they send 77 cents to the town tax office , compared with 61 cents in 1988 ( see chart on previous page ) . What 's especially disturbing is the powerful pattern of increases . Since 1995 property taxes nationwide have jumped 48% , 30 percentage points more than inflation . The rampage is happening because property taxes are tied not to homeowners ' incomes but to the market prices of their houses . The levies are calculated by applying the town 's tax rate to the home 's " assessed value , " a figure based on the municipality 's appraisal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towns hold tax rates at the same level , the tax bills rise at the same pace that houses are gaining in value . That 's precisely what 's happening . Towns and cities-which desperately need the money-are bagging a huge windfall from the hot real estate market without facing the political heat of raising tax rates . " It 's nirvana for politicians , " marvels David Brunori , a municipalgovernment specialist at George Washington University . " Tax rates stay the same , and the politicians keep getting more money every year . They 're never subject to the charge that they raised taxes . " ' What matters , however , is n't the fuzzy rhetoric but the actual increase in dollars homeowners are paying . Pick cases from across the country , and you 'll see that the numbers are shocking . Before we visit those beleaguered homeowners , it 's important to understand that the picture varies enormously across America 's 18,000 municipalities . People pay vastly different amounts , and face vastly different rates of increase , on houses with identical values-not only in different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The main reason for the patchwork pattern is that many states , and some towns , impose legal limits on property taxes . Most of the restrictions date from the 1970s and early 1980s , when a property-tax rebellion swept the U.S. In 1978 , California adopted the granddaddy of limitations , Proposition 13 . Its rules are still in force . So are the tough restrictions in two other states that rank among the nation 's strongest markets , Florida and Massachusetts . In Florida , for example , assessments ca n't rise faster than 3% a year ; in California the cap on increases is 2% . The restrictions create two basic classes of taxpayers . Homeowners in states like Texas , New York , and Virginia often watch their tax bills climb in big yearly steps . In California or Florida , taxpayers get a big break , as long as they remain in their houses : Their taxes trail far behind the increases in market value . Sounds great . The problem is that when a resident of San Francisco or Boca Raton sells , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , wham ! Taxes can easily double or triple overnight when the deed changes hands . The new owner is stuck with a bill that often rivals the charges in Virginia or New York ( though the impact is cushioned in California because the tax rate is capped at a reasonably low 1% ) . Hence , even in the states with limitations , the big , sudden tax bite when property is sold exerts strong downward pressure on prices . " What matters most is what the new buyer has to pay , not the break the previous homeowner was getting in the past , " says Dominic M. Calabro , president of Florida Tax Watch , a watchdog group for taxpayers in the Sunshine State . Let 's survey the damage in both kinds of markets . Consider Cuccinelli , the Stonewall Jackson fan , who , outside of politics , works as a patent attorney . He bought his four-bedroom colonial on half an acre in Fairfax County , Va. , a suburb of Washington , D.C. , in 2000 . Since then the assessment has shot from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in lockstep with the town 's appraisal , from $2,560 a year to $4,400 , a 72% increase . " That 's 67% more than inflation ! " complains Cuccinelli . " What cost in America is rising that fast , except for property taxes ? " For New York attorney Joel Marcus , the story is even more alarming . Since 1997 , the levy on his four-bedroom , $2.2 million manse in Harrison , N.Y , a wealthy Westchester County suburb , jumped from $24,500 to $38,000 . " That 's the equivalent of a jump of a point and a half in my mortgage ! " marvels Marcus . " So I went to an adjustable mortgage to offset the increase in taxes . If my mortgage rate goes up , I could face trouble . " In states with limitations , it 's new buyers who face the sticker shock . In Boca Raton , a well-heeled retiree who bought a waterfront house for $800,000 in the late 1990s pays about $23,000 in taxes- a bargain , believe it or not , because of the cap on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purchaser pays $1.6 million , and suddenly the assessment doubles . And taxes jump to $40,000 a year . Fortunately for Cuccinelli , Marcus and our sample retiree , the prices of their houses are still rising . But do n't be fooled . Their homes would be worth a lot more if property taxes had n't jumped . It 's simple mathema ics . For a warehouse or office building , when the taxes or insurance or maintenance costs take a leap , the building 's value declines . The same forces apply to houses . The $1,840 rise in Cuccinelli 's taxes will cost him $1,300 after taxes ( property taxes are deductible from federal income taxes ) . According to Zandi , that $1,300 in additional expenses slices the value of his house by a factor of ten , or $13,000 . How about Marcus ? We were afraid you 'd ask . His $13,500 increase , about $9,500 after taxes , cuts the value of his home by $95,000 . And the retiree in sunny Boca ? When he sells , the new buyer will shave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that strikes when the house changes hands . Of course , higher taxes would n't reduce values at all if they generated big improvements in schools , parks , and other services . And in the past that 's often happened . " Traditionally towns with the highest property tax increases had the best schools , " says Karl Case , an economist at Wellesley College . " That had a big , positive effect on property values . " But the picture has changed . Large increases in school spending per pupil , adjusted for inflation , have n't been adequate to boost test scores-yet taxes to fund the spending continue to rise . " The general consensus is that municipalities have n't delivered on the promise to deliver better services , " says Bill Ahern of the Tax Foundation , a Washington , D.C. , think tank . To measure the pressure on houses , and why it 's likely to keep mounting , let 's go back and look at Fairfax County , Va . ( pop . 1.1 million ) , the Washington , D.C. , suburb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has jumped 6% a year-the biggest motor is school spending , which acounts for about half the budgeteven though inflation and population growth combined are around 4% . During that period receipts from sales taxes , a levy on boats and cars , and state aid have been flat or declining . As a result , the portion of spending covered by property taxes has leaped from 50% to 59% of a far bigger budget . For the county 's homeowners , the scenario is even worse than it looks . Many dot-com and other tech companies in Fairfax either folded or shrank . As a result , residential property taxes have shouldered the burden for virtually all the budget increases . By 2004 taxes on the average house will have risen a projected 57% over 2000 levels . " Increases in property taxes do n't give people the ability to pay them in a sour economy , " says Cuccinelli . " Families are being ordered to tighten their belts so the government can be comfortable . " The momentum behind the municipal spending spree is so strong that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prices rise . " If house prices flatten or decline , the best bet is that towns start raising the tax rates , so the dollars homeowners pay will keep rising fast , " predicts Zandi . Get used to it .
