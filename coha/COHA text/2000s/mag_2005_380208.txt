Natural disasters are terrible things but what ultimately defines us is not what happens to us but how we react . After the tsunami hit , the world donated billions of dollars ; Americans alone gave $1.6 billion , more than to any other disaster overseas . And four months after Hurricane Katrina , the donations approach $3 billion . This got me to thinking about the nature of giving , and what makes for temporary relief vs. lasting change . Sudden disasters get the big headlines , but day after day other tragedies of avoidable dimensions unfold : the one child who dies of malaria in Africa every 29 seconds , the one person who is infected with HIV every 6.4 seconds , the 8 million who die every year because they are too poor to stay alive . And who is proving most effective in figuring out how to eradicate those calamities ? In different ways , it is Bill and Melinda Gates , co-founders of the world 's wealthiest charitable foundation , and Bono , the Irish rocker who has made debt reduction sexy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ TIME 's Persons of the Year . Josh Tyrangiel explores how Bono gets his message across . Amanda Ripley and Amanda Bower spend time with the Gateses and dissect their charitable approach . Michael Duffy hangs with our Partners of the Year : George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton , the onetime rivals who joined forces to raise relief money . My thanks to Priscilla Painton , who deftly ran the project , and to all my other colleagues who made this issue so special . <P> For the past four years , Eileen Naughton has served as president of TIME  --  and my business-side partner . In a company consolidation , Ed McCarrick , the worldwide publisher of TIME , now adds the role of president to his portfolio . Eileen , Ed and I are good friends , and Ed joins me in saluting Eileen and thanking her for all that she did here . This one 's for you , Eileen .
