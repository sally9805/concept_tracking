The Wright brothers were first . Lindbergh made it sexy . But it was the Boeing 707 that brought air travel to the masses - and changed the world . // ON OCT. 26 , 1958 , A PAN AM FLIGHT MADE THE TRIP from New York to Paris in eight hours , 41 minutes . Today that time would be nothing special , maybe even a little slow . But in 1958 , such a short transatlantic flight was revolutionary , and so was the plane that achieved it : the Boeing 707 , America 's first passenger jet . The Wright brothers may have gotten aviation off the ground , and Charles Lindbergh and Amelia Earhart may have popularized it , but it 's no exaggeration to describe the coming of the 707 as the single most transformative event in the annals of 20th-century flight . Prior to the 707 , air travel was primarily for the rich , and even they had their doubts about its safety . The propeller planes of the day were also slow , needed frequent refueling stops , and vibrated like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of ten passengers crossing the Atlantic in 1952 went by air . And although the inaugural edition of the FORTUNE 500 in 1955 did n't include transportation companies ( until 1995 the list was restricted to industrial firms ) , the magazine 's separate transportation rankings for that year found the top ten spots all occupied by railroads . The highest airline was American , at No. 12 . The 707 changed all that . Its turbofan jet engines made it suitable for high altitudes and high speeds , and its sleek , streamlined design exuded a palpable sense of security . ( The ultimate validation of this came in 1962 , when the White House began using a 707 as Air Force One . ) Its large cabin could accommodate up to 200 passengers-enough to change the economics of ticket pricing-and its cruising speed of 575 miles per hour was nearly two-thirds faster than any propeller-driven passenger plane . With non-stop flights becoming more the rule than the exception and rides becoming smooth enough for passengers to keep a cocktail glass on their tray tables , the 707 transformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of cosmopolitan sophistication . It even changed the language , giving rise to terms like jet lag , the jet set , and the New York Jets . But the plane 's revolutionary effect was n't limited to the flying public . By essentially launching modern air travel , the 707 sent a ripple effect through American business , affecting everything from heavy industry to tourism . It delivered a body blow to the railroads ( in 1959 , the first full year of the Jet Age , three airlines appeared among FORTUNE 'S top ten transportation companies ) and sounded a death knell for ocean liners . It also transformed an industry that soon threatened to become too successful for its own good . And for better or worse-some of both , really-it created a travel culture that 's become seamlessly integrated into countless facets of American life , eventually turning something miraculous and exciting into something , well , miraculous and banal . THE 707 GOT ITS CHANCE IN LARGE PART BEcause of the failure of another jet , the de Havilland Comet . This pioneering British plane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place in history that the 707 now holds , but a series of catastrophic accidents-triggered by metal fatigue exacerbated by the plane 's square windows-grounded the Comet fleet and opened the door for Boeing . Still , putting the 707 into production was a huge gamble : There were no orders , so the project was done completely on spec , and Boeing 's estimates projected development costs of $16 million-20% of the company 's value and more than twice its 1951 profits . As it turned out , by the time Pan Am took delivery of the first 20 planes in August 1958 ( the airline had placed its order in 1955 , a year after Boeing demonstrated its prototype ) , the development costs had exceeded Boeing 's net worth . But the gamble paid off : In 1958 , the year of the 707 's debut , Boeing jumped from No. 32 to No. 19 in the 500 rankings ; it would n't fall as low as 32 again until the oil crisis of 1973 . In the world beyond Boeing , the 707 made all sorts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put it , " In one fell swoop we have shrunken the earth . " As if to prove him right , in 1960 , FORTUNE ran a feature story entitled " The World Is Their Territory , " about the exciting new trend of American executives taking business trips abroad-imagine that ! - where they encountered such exotic problems as foreign languages and weak martinis . Such provincialism sounds laughable measured against today 's road-warrior business travelers , but from those humble beginnings came one of the Jet Age 's major outgrowths : multinationalism , as companies found it easier to move people and resources around the globe . While some companies were shipping their executives hither and yon , others were shipping freight . Airborne deliveries had once consisted of little more than airmail letters . ( Boeing , in fact , had its own airmail route in the 1930s , until the government decreed that plane manufacturers could n't simultaneously be carriers . ) But the 707 , with its shorter flying times and larger cargo holds , made the skies much friendlier for packages : From 1955 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whose initial attempt at air service had been scuttled by the Great Depression , resumed flying for good in 1953 and saw its air business shoot upward during the Jet Age . But it was Federal Express , which began operations in 1973 , that really exploited the jet 's capabilities by creating the overnight-delivery market . In 1981 , FedEx went beyond packages by introducing the overnight letter , and the following year UPS began offering next-day service as well . You probably know both companies are now FORTUNE 500 mainstays ; what you may not know is that their air fleets both rank among America 's ten largest . As for airmail , once a premium offering of the Postal Service , the classification no longer exists and the term is a quaint anachronism : Today nearly all mail is airmail . Of course , jets ' primary cargo was people , and as jets made travel more accessible , more people took advantage of it-too many , in fact . From 1955 to 1972 , the number of airline passengers grew from 42 million to 205 million @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By 1966 , FORTUNE was calling airport congestion a " disturbing national problem " - and a permanent one , apparently , as indicated by subsequent articles like " The Worsening Air Travel Mess , " " Airports : The Dark Side of the Travel Boom , " and " How to Cure Those #@* &!; Airline Delays . " Boeing 's 747 jumbo jet , which debuted in 1970 ( and would eventually drive Lockheed out of the passenger-jet arena and lead Boeing to acquire its other chief rival , McDonnell Douglas ) , was supposed to ease the overcrowding , but instead it exacerbated it by making air travel more accessible . By 1974 , 45 million more Americans had flown than in 1968 . This influx of new travelers , plus the 747 's need for longer runways , set the stage for the development of the modern airport , which has now become an important yardstick of urban viability and has spawned its own on-site service economy . Hotels , which used to be clustered downtown , are now clustered around airports as well ; so are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Jet Age . Think of this planes/hotels/cars troika as the hospitality-industrial complex . United Airlines tried to capitalize on these synergies in the 1970s and ' ' 80s by merging with the Westin hotel chain and then acquiring Hertz , creating a one-stop-shopping company for business travelers . Although that experiment failed-United sold off the hotel and car units-the concentration of airport-driven hotel business has vaulted chains like Marriott , Hilton , and Starwood into the 500 listings . Meanwhile , with conference rooms and other business facilities increasingly available within airports , business travelers can now arrive , attend their meetings , and return home without ever leaving the terminal 's hermetic seal . So instead of being a gateway to a destination , the airport has become a destination itself . But the modern road warriors living this lifestyle are n't exactly the fanciful globetrotters that the Jet Age 's pioneers envisioned . " Business travel is pretty context-free today , " says Gary Hamel , a strategy consultant who at one point traveled about 150 days per year ( he 's now down to 100 ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you go to a hotel that 's like any other hotel , and by lunchtime you 're in a car going back to the airport . " Ironically , supertravelers like Hamel often get little sense of where they 're traveling . " If I go to Helsinki , even in winter , I do n't bother to take an overcoat , because I 'll be going from the airport to a car to an office building , " he says . " It 's not like you walk anywhere or really see anything . " For these contemporary jet setters , the world has shrunk so much that flying has essentially been reduced to long-haul commuting . Service industry consultant Linda Novey , who has traveled 200 days a year for two decades , says , " My friends get up in the morning , go to the garage , get in the car , and go to work . Well , I get up in the morning , I go to the airport , I get on the plane , and I go to work . The end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world in which people live from airport to airport , combined with modern air terminals ' massive size ( Chicago 's O'Hare employs more than 50,000 people , and Dallas 's DFW has its own Zip Code ) , has led many cultural observers to describe airports as cities . Which is true enough if you mean a city with crummy food , boring shops , no emotion or creativity , and a Cinnabon on every corner . The more apt comparison is a mall , with all the suburbanized blandness that implies-it 's T.G.I.Airport . And it was n't supposed to be this way : In 1958 FORTUNE described New York 's Idlewild airport as an " inspiring aerial gateway " with a new renovation that promised " striking architecture and landscaping . " If that does n't sound like any New York airport you 've ever experienced , that 's because Idlewild is the overcrowded monument to tedium now known as J.F.K. , its once-proud TWA terminal , designed by Eero Saarinen , now sitting dormant ( although JetBlue is hoping to revive it as a lobby ) . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ process , this **25;1812;TOOLONG environment was probably inevitable . And there 's no escape-even the most well-appointed airline club lounge is ultimately just a generic limbo with no sense of place . If this really were a city , they 'd call it Nowhere . MOST OF THE AIRLINES DID BOOM BUSINESS IN the early years of the Jet Age : The average value of airline stocks jumped 250% between 1960 and 1965 . But with complaints mounting about delays and deteriorating service , a reckoning was inevitable , and it arrived in the form of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 . Since 1938 , the federal Civil Aeronautics Board had controlled the industry 's routes , schedules , and prices , which were generally kept artificially high to protect the airlines . This left the carriers with little to compete over except whose flight attendants had the sexiest outfits ( a trend begun in 1965 as a marketing stunt by Braniff , whose stewardesses would shed several layers of their uniforms during a flight , a routine known as the " air strip " ) . But with deregulation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ array of low-cost , no-reservations carriers moving in on their long-established territories . The blueprint for this type of service had been laid out in the early 1970s by Southwest , which was n't subject to price regulation because it flew exclusively within Texas and therefore did n't qualify as interstate commerce . This head start helped Southwest navigate through deregulation 's initial chaos and emerge as the consistently successful operation it remains today . Other cut-rate pioneers , like Laker Airways and People Express ( the latter of which was so no-frills that passengers paid their fares on the plane ) , did n't survive the revolution they helped start , but you can draw a straight line from them to contemporary outfits like JetBlue and AirTran , with a dotted line to the major airlines ' new budget-priced subsidiaries , like Delta 's Song and United 's Ted . Deregulation was supposed to be good for consumers , and in many respects it was . The average fare , as measured by the cost per mile flown , decreased by 28% from 1979 to 1993 . And while many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cue joke : " When you die and go to heaven , you have to change planes in Atlanta ! " ) , it had some unsung advantages : In 1978 , 50% of passengers changing planes on domestic trips also had to change airlines ; by 1993 , that figure was down to 1% . But removing the industry 's governor wheel led to even more overcrowding : Deregulation 's first two decades saw a 70% increase in commercial flights ( and more articles about those #@* &!; delays ) . All that frequent flying led to the advent of frequent-flier programs . The first one , which awarded first-class trips to Hawaii for elite-level travelers , was announced by American Airlines in May 1981 . United followed with its own version a week later , and TWA did likewise the week after that . " We were pretty convinced that some form of what we were developing would hang around for a long time , " says Rolfe Shellenberger , who helped create American 's AAdvantage program and is considered by many to be the father of the frequent-flier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreseen that one day consumers would be earning miles by switching long-distance phone carriers and using airline-branded credit cards , that they 'd be redeeming those miles for magazine subscriptions and charitable donations , or that the whole system would become a sort of independent barter economy . Meanwhile , by encouraging price wars that led to razor-thin margins , deregulation turned what had been a relatively staid industry topsy-turvy . This led to a new breed of airline executives , epitomized by the notorious Frank Lorenzo , who took a regional operation called Texas Air and built it into a national powerhouse by purchasing other airlines , including Eastern , Continental , and People Express . His signature move came in 1983 when he broke Continental 's unions by moving the airline into Chapter 11 bankruptcy-despite its $60 million in cash reserves-which allowed him to annul the company 's labor contracts and then resume operations under significantly less generous terms . Eastern 's unions were so afraid of him that they tried , unsuccessfully , to arrange an employee buyout before he could acquire the airline . If Continental 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into financial ruin and eventual 1991 liquidation-at the cost of 40,000 jobs-showed that Lorenzo 's strong-arm tactics did n't always work . Not that anyone else had a magic touch during this period , either : America West , TWA , Braniff , Midway , and even the venerable Pan Am all filed for bankruptcy protection between 1989 and 1993 , with the latter three joining Eastern in shutting down for good . ( TWA , whose last profitable year was 1988 , emerged from its 1993 bankruptcy but was permanently grounded in 2001 , with American eventually purchasing most of its assets . ) Nine of the nation 's ten largest carriers lost money during this stretch . The industry was just stabilizing when it was hit by something much bigger than deregulation : 9/11 . The disaster did n't just expose how vulnerable the air transport system was to attack ; it also showed how dependent the economy had become on air transport . We found out , if only for a few days , what life was like without airplanes : stranded travelers , canceled conferences , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When flights resumed , many travelers were reluctant to fly , just as in the old days . The shrunken world became big again . So what happens next ? Industry analyst Michael Boyd expects passenger traffic to return to pre-9/11 levels around 2006 . Among those hoping he 's right is European aerospace manufacturer Airbus , because that 's the same year it will introduce the A380 , a double-decker megajet that can carry 555 people . But aviation 's future wo n't just be about getting bigger : The main selling points of Boeing 's next major passenger plane-the 7E7 Dreamliner , expected to launch in 2008-are fuel efficiency and Internet connectivity . By then the industry may also be seeing an increased trend toward small , short-range planes called microjets . Particularly well suited for the smaller airports that the major carriers are abandoning in favor of urban hub consolidation , microjets may end up functioning as a sort of air-taxi system , which would relieve overcrowding at the hubs and provide a new aviation network for domestic business travelers . In some ways , this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airports-Long Beach instead of LAX , Oakland instead of San Francisco-shows how even an industry as elephantine as this one can still be nimble and responsive when a bit of creativity is applied . As for the 707 , Boeing stopped producing it in 1991 , although it 's still in service here and there , mostly in Africa and South America . The era it ushered in promised to be suave and cultured-think about that the next time you 're walking through security in your socks or standing in line at Pretzel Time . But if the Jet Age never fully delivered on that promise , that 's not because it failed-it 's because it succeeded too well , generating a public demand that has constantly outstripped the industry 's capacity . It 's also because travelers craved an unattainably romantic notion of what air travel could represent , a notion that was slowly eroded by decades of delayed flights and then destroyed entirely by 9/11 . So while we 'll no doubt keep flying , any lingering view of the skies as a picturesque fantasyland is gone . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after the World Trade Center attacks , " Americans have long known that " eternal vigilance is the price of liberty . ' Now we know it is the price of mobility as well . " In retrospect , maybe it was the big world that was more romantic after all . Sidebar Takeoff In October 1957 , the first production 707 rolls off the line at Boeing 's plant in Renton , Wash .
