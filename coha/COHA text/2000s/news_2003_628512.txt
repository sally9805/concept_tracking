<p> Only one rookie was missing from the Texans ' rookie minicamp this weekend - quarterback Drew Henson . <p> While third-round pick Dave Ragone impressed everyone with his arm strength , accuracy and engaging personality , Henson continued to toil for the New York Yankees ' Class AAA team in Columbus , Ohio . <p> " We got some bad news last night - Drew hit a home run , " owner Bob McNair said with a smile after Saturday 's morning practice . <p> The truth is the Texans are hoping Henson fails at baseball and reaches a buyout with the Yankees before the 2004 draft . To become an unrestricted free agent in the NFL , Henson has to play out his Yankees contract or go through two NFL drafts and sit out two seasons . <p> Drafted with a compensatory pick in the sixth round - the shrewdest move in the draft , by the way - Henson is a quarterback struggling at the plate and in the field at Columbus . <p> At worst , the Texans lose a sixth-round pick . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next draft , and they 'll be able to trade him . <p> It 's not too early to look at trade possibilities for Henson , who played behind Tom Brady at Michigan , started eight games , then signed with the Yankees . He had 18 touchdown passes and four interceptions in his season as the Wolverines ' starter . <p> First , keep in mind that Mississippi 's Eli Manning is the early favorite to be the top pick in the draft , and Cleveland might be trying to deal Tim Couch , the top pick in the 1999 draft . <p> Do you think Green Bay would like to have Henson to groom behind Brett Favre , who turns 35 in October 2004 ? The Packers admitted they would have used their No. 1 pick on Kyle Boller , but Baltimore traded to get him . <p> What about Oakland , which lost Super Bowl XXXVII to Tampa Bay ? Although Rich Gannon was voted the NFL 's MVP , he turns 38 in December . <p> Carolina , which improved from one to seven victories last season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris Weinke . Unless the Panthers know something about Delhomme the Saints did n't , Carolina could be a starting quarterback short of being a Super Bowl contender after this season . <p> In June , Brian Griese will be waived by Denver . He 's expected to sign with Miami or Dallas . After the season , the Dolphins and Cowboys could still be interested in Henson . <p> Other teams to consider would be Pittsburgh , Tennessee , St. Louis , San Francisco and the New York Giants . If you analyze their quarterback situations , they also might be interested in a 6-4 , 220-pound prospect with a cannon right arm . <p> Last , but certainly not least , is Arizona . But the Cardinals could be so bad this season they might be in position to draft Manning . If not , you 'd have to think Arizona would be another candidate to become involved in a Henson sweepstakes . <p> Before anything can happen , of course , Henson has to give up baseball , which means Texans fans should be rooting for his hitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ league <p> Under the microscope - The Cardinals , who have registered a league-worst 21 , 19 and 25 sacks the last three seasons , are considering a defensive alignment that utilizes five linemen in some situations . One will be defensive end Calvin Pace , one of the team 's two No. 1 picks . <p> Pace , who played at Wake Forest , is under a lot of pressure because the Cardinals selected him after trading down in the first round and bypassing Arizona State defensive end Terrell Suggs , who also went to high school in Phoenix . <p> " Terrell is a great player , and I acknowledge that , but you have to look at me , too , " Pace said . " I 'm second to none . The Cardinals have done their scouting . They 've done their research . " <p> Pace had eight sacks last season . Suggs , who was drafted by Baltimore and will play outside linebacker , set an NCAA record with 24 . <p> Local heroes - Tired of reading about college coaches gone wild and players @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three women - one who resides in Houston and is detailing in court alleged instances of physical abuse ? <p> Last week in this space , we told you about Packers receiver Donald Driver 's celebrity golf tournament to raise money for his foundation . Here 's another story about a native Houstonian , Bucs receiver Keenan McCardell , who is doing the same thing as Driver . <p> Like Driver , McCardell has been a noted philanthropist in every city in which he 's played - Cleveland , Jacksonville and now Tampa . <p> For instance , after a prime-time game in December , McCardell got up early , picked up some disadvantaged children in a limo and took them on an early-morning Christmas shopping spree at a store that opened early specifically for them . <p> In June , the Keenan McCardell Celebrity Golf Classic in Tampa benefits the Touching Hands Foundation and the American Cancer Society . The foundation supports outreach programs that promote early detection of cancer and healthier lifestyles in diverse and underserved communities . It offers financial support and program assistance to nonprofit organizations serving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ involving coaches and athletes is getting so much attention , players like McCardell and Driver - as well as many others - should take a bow because of what they 're giving back to their communities . <p> Forget the past - Tampa Bay coach Jon Gruden is tired of being asked why University of Texas quarterback Chris Simms lasted until the last pick of the third round . <p> " Well , he has a lot to prove , and forget about where he was picked in the draft , " Gruden said . " He 's battling Brad Johnson , Shaun King and Jim Miller for a position on this team . If you 're going to be a real sensitive , thin-skinned guy about where you got picked , I wish you well in this league . <p> " He 's over that . He 's got to really concentrate on the verbiage , the terminology and get himself mentally squared away where he can compete . " <p> Youth is served - The average age of the projected starters on the Saints ' defense is 25.6 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defenses . Eight starters will be 26 or younger and have fewer than four years of experience . Four starters will be rookies or first-year players . " The objective was not to get younger , " defensive coordinator Rick Venturi said . " The objective was to get faster without compromising strength . I want to make one thing perfectly clear : Inexperience is no excuse . " . . . Venturi on the minicamp : " Hey , I 've never lost a minicamp . I 'm undefeated in 23 years in minicamp , so we 're not going to jump up and down and shout . We 've got a lot of work over the next four months . We 're quicker , we 're faster and I like the makeup of our team . Now we got to prove it on a daily basis . " . . . Pro Bowl receiver Joe Horn refuses to participate in the offseason program or the minicamp and vows to stay away unless he gets a new contract . He has two seasons left on his current deal . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victory , the Buccaneers have a season-ticket waiting list of 80,000 - third behind Green Bay and Washington . . . . Because the Titans have so few cap dollars and they need to re-sign quarterback Neil O'Donnell , punter Craig Hentrich and center Gennaro DiNapoli , they have n't signed unrestricted free agents from other teams . But they did sign 34 undrafted free agents . By comparison , the Texans signed five . . . . Quarterback Carson Palmer , the top pick in the draft , is second on Cincinnati 's depth chart behind Jon Kitna . Akili Smith , the third pick in the 1999 draft who has been a monster bust , could be waived June 1 . . . . Speaking of Kitna , he was asked at the team 's minicamp how he would approach Palmer ? " Carson , will you sign this ? " Kitna said with a laugh . <p> Snack artist - Donald Willis , a reserve offensive lineman at Kansas City who is coming off a ruptured Achilles ' tendon , is nicknamed " Snacks . " Coach Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you combine an Achilles ' tendon problem with a fork problem , you 've got two problems , " Vermeil said . . . . Atlanta rookie receiver Jon Olinger on the prospects of playing with quarterback Michael Vick : " After I heard I got drafted by the Falcons , I was at a loss for words , really . I mean , Mike Vick . I was just mesmerized and enchanted by it all . " . . . The Bears are hoping receiver Justin Gage , a fourth-round pick , will push starter David Terrell , a former No. 1 pick . " Of course , I want to start , and , of course , I want to be the main guy , " Terrell said . " Everybody who competes wants to be Michael Jordan . They do n't want to be Harold Miner . " <p> Good Knight - The Packers and Dolphins seem to be the finalists in the race to sign former New Orleans strong safety Sammy Knight , who made the Pro Bowl in 2001 but did n't play as well last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made the team as an undrafted free agent , had a team-high 127 tackles and five interceptions . . . When he was drafted in the fifth round by Green Bay , Oregon State nose tackle James Lee said : " I 'm just pacing , I ca n't believe this . I 'm excited . I am so excited . My mouth just dropped . I 'm shaking in my feet . " . . . Quarterback Trent Dilfer , who has been recovering from a torn Achilles ' tendon , has been told by the Seahawks to take off for as long as he needs after the death of his 5-year-old son , Trevin , who was stricken by a heart virus . Dilfer has told the team he plans to play this season . Dilfer is second on the depth chart behind Matt Hasselbeck . They drafted Seneca Wallace in the fourth round and might re-sign Jeff George . <p> <p> Elite company <p> Former Oilers defensive end Elvin Bethea , who will be inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Aug. 3 , will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ IW Marks Touchdowner of the Year .
