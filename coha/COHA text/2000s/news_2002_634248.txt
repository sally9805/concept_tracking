<p> Ellen DeGeneres <p> ? 176-129 ? 8:30 p.m . Saturday <p> ? 176-129 ? Chicago Theatre , 175 N. State <p> ? 176-129 ? Tickets , $32-$40 <p> ? 176-129 ? ( 312 ) 902-1500 <p> Along with success on the small screen  --  including her Peabody and People 's Choice awards , Emmy and Golden Globe nominations , and acclaimed hosting gigs on the Grammys and the Emmys  --  DeGeneres has also made her mark as an author and film actress . <p> The outspoken entertainer , who makes a one-night-only appearance at the Chicago Theatre on Saturday , talked candidly with WeekendPlus about her comedy , her upcoming plans for a nationally syndicated talk show , and what it is like to have everyone read about your private life as they 're waiting in the supermarket checkout line . <p> Q. You started doing standup comedy more than 20 years ago . Is standup your first love ? <p> A. Being on stage with people in front of me is my favorite thing . It does n't even have to be standup . It can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing for me . As long as I 'm in front of people and making people laugh , that 's the whole thing for me . That 's why I know the talk show will be very close to that . We 'll start out with a live audience and that will make all the difference to me . <p> Q. Speaking about the talk show , how do you see it coming together ? Will it be more like Oprah ? Or Rosie ? Or Regis &; Kelly ? I assume it wo n't be like Jerry Springer . <p> A. No , that 's exactly what it 's going to be . That 's all I want . I want people throwing chairs at each other . I want to see something even more humiliating than my life on TV  --  and I 'm just standing back watching it . Let 's bring back Roseanne , too . I miss that . There 's somebody for everybody out there . <p> Q. Seriously , how do you see your show developing when it does go on the air ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . It does n't go on until fall 2003 . My first instinct is I 'll have the guests stand . They wo n't sit . Everyone has them sit and that gets them lazy . And maybe having them fixing things around the set . Let 's see if they 're handy . Everybody cooks ; that 's boring . Maybe they 'll fix some of my stuff I 'll bring from home . ... And there will be lots of aerial shots ! We 've seen their faces , we do n't need to see that . Let 's see what the top of their heads look like ! <p> I do n't know . There 's only so much stuff you can do with that talk show format . But I 'm going to do my best to make it fun and entertaining and have interesting people on . I used to love it when Johnny Carson would bring guests on who were just human interest stories . Hopefully , I can bring something to it . <p> In the final analysis , it really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Oprah , it 's because I want to watch Oprah for the hour . I want to see who she has on as guests also , but it 's mainly because I like her . It should be interesting and fun , no matter what the subject matter is . <p> I think it 's that same thing when you 're choosing between Jay Leno and Dave Letterman . It 's not so much about the guests  --  unless it 's someone really special that you do n't see that often . I think it 's about the personality you want to spend the hour with ... and it 's about the tone and whether it 's comfortable and makes you feel good . <p> Q. Rosie O'Donnell seems so good at putting her guests at ease . What 's your take on how she makes that work ? <p> A. Rosie is so great . She is so purely Rosie and there is no one like her . She 's gutsy , she 's a strong woman , and I think people like to see that . Hers is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I 'm sure that if I had kids , I would be exactly the same , which is the reason I 'm putting off having kids , because if I had them , I would n't even leave the house . I know how I am with my cats , so I can imagine how I would be with a child . I would just stare at it and go , " It blinked ! " <p> Q. Have you talked to Rosie O'Donnell since she came out and revealed she was a lesbian ? <p> A. I have , I just talked to her the other day . I 'm thrilled for her and I thought she did a really good thing . She 's doing a lot of good and I do believe they are going to try and change things in Florida regarding changing the law so gays can adopt children . <p> Q. Would you like to have kids ? <p> A. Yeah , some day . I really think that the new show is going to take up a lot of my time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a child , anyway . ... I 'd like to have a child , but not HAVE a child . I can adopt . <p> Q. Many people  --  not just gay women  --  look to you as a role model . What do you think about all that ? It is a huge responsibility ? <p> A. I can understand to a degree , but I really ca n't step back and analyze it completely . Look , when I grew up I wanted to be famous , and I think that 's because my parents were very impressed by celebrities . They really responded differently to famous people . And I saw that and I think kids pick up on that kind of stuff . So I thought , that 's how you get attention . Everybody loves you if you 're a celebrity . <p> So I grew up with that feeling of wanting to be famous . I did n't know what that meant . I was n't a dancer or a singer and I certainly did n't think being funny could earn you a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Suddenly , you realize  --  once you hit a certain level  --  that you are the same person you always were . You 've got the same stuff that other people struggle with . The only difference is that basically more people just know who I am and more people get to form an opinion of me  --  both good and bad . <p> You do n't know that when you 're dreaming of everyone loving you . You forget there 's the other side , too . I do n't really think of myself other than a person trying to be a good person and I 'm trying to learn a lot of lessons along the way  --  more than I like , but that 's fine . With each mistake I 've made , I 've grown . I 've become a much richer person than if I had n't made them . <p> Q. It seems very gutsy for you to come out of the closet when you did . <p> A. I do think what I did was definitely a brave thing to do and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other people doing it . And for whatever reason  --  and I do n't know why  --  I was able to do it . Something inside me said do it , and it was a very loud voice . It was something important to my inner growth and I did n't even know that . I just thought it was the time to do this . <p> But if that alone was it  --  if it seemed there was definitely a price to pay for coming out , then that would have been a very bad example . If I had lost my career and not been able to come back , that would have been terrible . The fact that I was able to come back after " Ellen " was canceled by ABC  --  I hope that part is what is the inspiration . <p> It 's not about being gay or about coming out . It 's about doing something you 're scared to do , but ultimately it 's the right thing to do , because it 's right for you . <p> Q. Is it difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ checkout lines ? <p> A. I take responsibility for myself . I certainly did n't hide my personal life . <p> Q. Maybe a better question is : Do you regret it at all ? <p> A. I ca n't , because it brought me to where I am today . Now , having said that , I would never do it quite that way ever again . When I came out , I was at a very vulnerable point in my life . I intended just to come out and that would be it . And at that point , I met somebody who was not quiet , who was not private , who liked the attention . If only I could go back to that night the Vanity Fair Oscar party . <p> Q. And I was at that party , Ellen ! <p> A. If you only had talked to me 10 minutes longer and I had left after that , just think ! ... But there was something good for an openly gay couple to be seen at premieres and at the White House , because that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It shocked a lot of people . Because of me being on television , it affected my career , because you 're supposed to remain a blank slate . People are n't supposed to know too much about you so they can project whatever they want on you ... and it certainly worked for a long time . <p> By revealing all that about myself , it really did hurt my career . I do n't think coming out hurt my career as much as my relationship hurt my career . At the same time ... those were the choices I made and I take responsibility for them and I 'm a different person now because of all that . <p> Q. What was the most painful part of that whole period ? <p> A. There were many painful moments , but I remember one vividly . When Anne Heche first left , I went out and I had n't been out at all . I had to go to the Emmys because I was nominated for " If These Walls Could Talk , " and I did n't really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was walking in , someone screamed out from across the street , ' How 's Anne ? ' I was so fragile still , which anyone who has had their heart broken can understand . It 's a bad enough thing to have a broken heart , but to have it be so humiliating and so public . A broken heart is quite enough , but then it was like someone threw gasoline at you and lit a match . ... That 's the worst thing . <p> Q. Have you made peace with Anne ? <p> A. I have never spoken to her since that all ended . <p> Q. What can audiences look forward to with your new standup act ? <p> A. There will be some of the classic stuff I have n't done in a while , but there 's mostly new material . It 's basically about the amount of choices we have in the world today . With television and the Internet and everything moving so fast , I believe the amount of disorders we have in the world are proportionate to the amount @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how we need to slow down a bit . <p> Q. Where are you now on a personal level ? <p> A. I 'm in a relationship . I 'm happy . Things are very quiet and lovely and good ... I 'm back focusing on my career . And my relationship is where it should be  --  it 's totally private and separate . <p> Q. With the talk show coming , you likely wo n't have much time for acting in films . Hope to do that again at some point ? <p> A. I love showing different sides of myself ... and I 'd love to show what I 'm capable of doing . I have n't really been able to do that in a movie . For whatever reason , that has n't happened up to this point . If that happens sometime in the future that would be great , but there are only three or four actresses over the age of 17 working today . So when that big juicy role comes up , they 'll go to Meg Ryan or Helen Hunt . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> A. Yeah , that 's what I 'm talking about , but poor Britney , she 's almost over the hill . What is she now , 20 ? <p> After her Chicago Theatre engagement , DeGeneres heads west to host " Divas Las Vegas , " a live VH1 concert on May 23 . Benefitting the VH1 Save the Music Foundation , the event will feature such acts as Stevie Nicks , Mary J. Blige , Cher , the Dixie Chicks , Celine Dion , Shakira and former Chicagoan Anastacia.
