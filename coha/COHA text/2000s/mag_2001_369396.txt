To the Karen , they were deities . To the Thais , they were demons . But when they staggered down from the mountains of Burma ( now known as Myanmar ) at dusk last Tuesday , Johnny and Luther Htoo bore neither miracles nor M-16s , just Bibles in their knapsacks . The tiny teenage twins and leaders of the mysterious rebel force known as God 's Army approached a company of Thai soldiers and asked for sanctuary . Whisked to a police compound in the nearby town of Suan Phung , they soon found themselves exchanging bewildered stares with Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai and a dozen of Thailand 's top generals . As Chuan inspected his prizes , he gently stroked the boys ' lice-ridden locks . " He totally demystified them , " says Sunai Phasuk , of Forum Asia , a human-rights group . In Thailand , where people still crawl before royalty , " you do n't pat a god on the head . " <P> God 's Army shot to prominence almost a year ago when 10 rebels from the group 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , taking 500 patients and staff members hostage . They were demanding that the Thai military stop shelling their mountain and that doctors treat their wounded . Witnesses said Thai commandos executed the 10 after they surrendered .

Most Karen fighters fled , but not Johnny and Luther . Leading a half-dozen rebels , the stories go , they beat back entire companies of Burmese soldiers . Their followers swore they had magic powers and were impervious to bullets . For a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ station , they seemed anything but saviors . Shorn of their weapons and fatigues , they appeared to be scrawny , stunted children smoking Thai cigarettes and munching on shortbread cookies . So what were they really ? <P> " They 're just kids , " said General Surayud Chulanont , commander in chief of the Thai army , after meeting them . " We think they may have been used as fronts by older rebels . " But at least one Karen elder gives them credit . " They really did defeat the Burmese with just a handful of men , " he says . Karen Christian priests , who also had frequent contact with God 's Army , confirmed the twins ' exploits . If the boys were natural-born fighters , it was clearly in the interests of their band to elevate them to something more .
