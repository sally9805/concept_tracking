An odd scent was in the air and Charlie MacLeod wondered where it might be coming from . From off the ocean it rode the wind and swept over him , faintly medicinal but pleasing , and he inhaled deeply to fill his lungs . Towering trees with long strips of peeling bark lined a narrow two-lane street and hugged the edges of a dirt path worn into the overgrown grass . Long , straggling limbs drooped low so that Charlie had to brush them out of his way . He 'd been traveling for days now , constantly on the move -- a bus , two trains , then another bus . He 'd walked for hours this morning , his belongings in an old canvas bag slung over his shoulder . He trudged up one last steep hill , came to the end of the path and stopped to catch his breath . A dirt road split off into the forest of trees , and at the intersection stood a waist-high marker made of rough , uncut stone . Exhausted , he removed his old wool cap to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bag at his feet . He rubbed the week 's worth of stubble on his face , a beard grayed by the passing of time and the pain of his memories . Dread that had been working on him since the moment he awoke finally swept over him and seized his body . His heart pounded into his throat as he tried to stop the utterance of a name , but failed as miserably as ever . " Helen , " he whispered , and realized he 'd traveled thousands of miles for nothing . " Christ , " he said , astears filled his eyes and spilled down his face . His legs weakened and he slid down to his haunches , the rough stone scraping his back . His head throbbed , blotches of light bordered his vision , and his hands and feet tingled as though a thousand needles had penetrated his skin . He covered his face with his hands and waited for his anxiety to pass . Past episodes had taken hours -- the worst ones , days -- to subside . He spent hours shaking , wandering through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he fell into bed and passed out . When he finally awoke it was impossible to get up . The only time he felt good was at work . He labored in a foundry shoveling sand and grinding metal , and though he was slight , he was strong . Charlie could work for hours . But when the whistle blew and the men dispersed he would sink again . Even as he put the key into the door of his new house , the panic would return . The wind rocked him and he came to ; how long he 'd been out he did n't know . His neck and face were dry . He pulled a clean towel from his bag and rubbed his hair , then draped it over his shoulder . He stood tentatively and circled the marker . A bronze plaque , dark and weather-worn with simple , bold lettering , stated what was stretched out beyond him over acres of green land . His spirits lightened . Amused but not quite believing , Charlie read the plaque again , then turned around to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage . Maybe the place is closed , he thought , or maybe they just do n't want anybody to know about it . A horn startled him as an old Chevy carrying four grown men slowed behind him . From the front passenger side , a bony-faced man eyed Charlie , then took a drag on his cigarette , and the sun-bleached blue car , engine tapping , brakes squealing , turned and spun up the dirt road . Inside the tree line , smooth blacktop stretched out before him . The foliage on either side formed a tunnel blocking out the sun and wind , and though it was colder here , the quiet was welcome . So he kept walking . Shortly the road widened into a parking lot , where the sun cast bright light over a small Tudor building at the far end . It looked warmer there , and Charlie picked up his pace . Parked alongside a small prefabricated aluminum building were tractors and riding mowers . Dark-haired , dark-skinned men with white-collared shirts , floppy hats and rubber boots sat at a picnic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here to loop ? " someone asked , and the question turned Charlie around . A short , chubby , gray-haired , red-faced man dressed in worn khakis , a blue polo shirt and an argyle sweater was jiggling a considerable key ring , trying to find the one that opened the trunk of his Chevy . " Forgot something , " he said , and pushed his wire-rimmed glasses closer to his face . " Aha ! " he said , holding up the key . He stuck out his hand . " Al Hrabovsky . I 'm the caddy master around here . " " Loop ? " A smile sprung to Charlie 's face . " Yeah , loop . What ? You 're not a caddy ? " Al pulled a pair of old tennis shoes from the trunk and held them up . " One of the guys needs them . " He spoke quickly , nervously . " Look , if you 're here for the grounds crew you 'll have to talk to Jos over there . But they 're mostly Mexicans . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I just had n't heard the word for such a long time . Loop . " " I saw you out there with the towel on your shoulder . " " Yeah , right , the towel , " Charlie said , trying to catch up to the conversation , lost in memories of yellow flags dotting deep green Pennsylvania hillsides . His left hand slowly rubbed his right elbow . " You all right ? " Al asked , and Charlie looked up . " You hurt your arm ? " Charlie let his arm fall . " You saw me out front , " he said . " We passed right by you . I thought you were a caddy . " " I am , I mean , I did when I was a kid . " " Oh , " Al said , and slammed the trunk shut . " I 'm sorry , but you got to know what you 're doing . I only have twenty or so caddies . They 're all older and for the most part , when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm always looking for another good one , though . " Charlie looked down at himself . He 'd been wearing the same clothes for three days . His hair was too long . He could n't remember if he 'd ever looked so bad . " I 've been on the road , " he said softly . " You look fine , " Al said , pointing at Charlie 's clothes . " I do n't care how you look and neither do the members . You should see some of these guys . We 're not hung up on all that stuff . But you got to know what you 're doing . " " I know what I 'm doing , " Charlie said with sudden certainty . " If I know anything , I know this . " He pointed at the clubhouse and grounds around him . " You got to know your yardages , clubs --  " " Reading greens , keep ' em clean . Flat yardage , playing yardage . Wind , hills , speak when spoken to . " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bag . That ai n't caddying . " Al shook his head . " No , it is n't . " Charlie sighed heavily . " To tell you the truth , I was n't really looking for work , " he said , loving what he saw and feeling calmer than he had in recent memory . " But I 'd like to . " The two started walking . " How 'd you hear about this place ? " Al asked . " I did n't , " Charlie answered . " I stopped and leaned on the marker out there . I was tired . Your car came by . " Al laughed . " All right , now I know you 're a caddy . I think that 's how we all got here . By accident . " They headed toward the clubhouse . " You play ? " Charlie shrugged and Al raised a hand . " Do n't worry . We got a caddy shack full of secrets . You 're safe here . " As they walked toward the clubhouse , Al @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Who lets their caddies wear shorts ? " Charlie asked . " Well , there 's been a trend lately but this membership is n't much into trends . They like things the way they are . You 'll find that out . " A few steps past the clubhouse Charlie passed into sunshine and took in the huge expanse of green land opening up before him . It was not like the green of home but more washed-out , the terrain flattening and fading endlessly into the horizon . The hazy sun muted the edges of the landscape . Gentle hills rolled away from him , more of the same kind of trees interspersed with giant stately pines separated the fairways . Clouds hovered high above , and below them a wall of fog looked as solid as the ground beneath his feet . " That 's the ocean , that way ? " he asked , taking a deep breath . " Yep . That 's number one , " Al said , pointing to a small , well-clipped tee box . " Beautiful , " Charlie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as if the builders had laid it gently , not wanting to disturb a thing . " No flowers , " Charlie said . " Just golf . " " No tennis courts , " Charlie said . " Just golf . " " Kids ? " " Hell , no . " " How many members ? " " Not many . " A small building sat off to the right . It had two doors . Al pointed at the near door . " Pro shop . " Then he pointed to the far door . " Caddy shack . That 's where you go . Do n't get the two confused . " Before a tall hedge , a few of the men sprawled on a wooden bench like they were waiting for a bus . " Have a seat , " Al said . Charlie felt stuck . There was something odd , indefinite , and preposterous about Al 's request . He wanted to ask , " For how long ? " or " What for ? " But just as he was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and craggy , a crumpled , sweat-ringed ball cap on his head , a cigarette burning between his lips , mouthing the first words Charlie ever heard on a golf course : " Boy , you 're a caddy , a mule . Speak when spoken to . " Assaulted by questions all day long -- from members , from staff -- the last thing a caddy master wants to hear is another question he ca n't answer . It 's what he hates most of all about his job , the caddies asking when they 'll work , if they 'll work , the members asking how long it will be before they can tee off . When ? How long ? Over and over again . And the truth is , if it ai n't right away the caddy master does n't know . He may act like he does , and he might -- and often does -- lie , but the fact is he does n't know . At this golf course , it 's a wait-and-see deal . There are no tee-times here . It 's first-come , first-play . If Mr. So-and-So shows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the caddy master , then they 'll play first and everyone else is going to have to wait . The caddy master might have some idea but , until the players are standing in front of him , he does n't really know shit . People call and say they 're coming , then do n't . Or they show up out of nowhere wanting to know when they could get off . There are busy times and slow times , and no one can predict the amount of play . A caddy has to wait and see , learn how to pass time , without going any crazier than he already is . That 's the trade-off for being able to leave anytime and for as long as you want . And as far as the caddy master 's concerned , you do n't ever have to come back . Do n't let the door hit you in the ass . And nobody can up and leave faster than a caddy does . The men drifted easily between the bench and inside the shack . They read newspapers , ate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mid-morning hour quiet and tranquil . No fewer than three chessboards were set on the bench between them . As Charlie approached , they moved quietly apart to make room for him . Welcoming the much-needed rest , he sat down and leaned back , blending in , anonymous , safe . His worry slowly began to peel away , like the strips of bark from the giant trees , and for the first time in a long while he imagined that someday he might just leave it behind for good . Chapter 2 The sun peeked out , then hid behind the incoming fog as caddies and players marched by in a sparse parade from the ninth green to the tenth tee and off the back nine . A twosome came trudging down eighteen with their caddy -- older men , stooped , gray and wind-burned , their age having betrayed them . Leaning forward into the prevailing wind , they were bundled in wool pants and sweaters to shield themselves from the elements , but it was far too late ; their faces and hands were a road map of wrinkles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Striding steadily before them with a large leather bag on each shoulder was a tall , broad man in khakis , an old gray sweatshirt and a red baseball cap . Well ahead of his players , he dropped the bags greenside and waited patiently as the two old men struggled up to their balls . The first took two shots to get out of a sand trap , cursed , then three-putted ; the other merely three-putted , shrugging his shoulders as if he 'd expected to all along . They laid their putters against their bags and huffed and puffed up the short , steep hill to the clubhouse as their caddy raked the trap smooth , replaced the flagstick , shouldered his bags and in a few quick strides caught up to and passed his players . That 's how it 's done , Charlie thought . The caddy stood his bags by the pro shop and the men paid him . " Thank you , Henry , " one said , and patted him on the back . " Same time , tomorrow . Good day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie and pulled a tattered paperback from his back pocket and red-framed half-glasses from his shirt pocket . " You all done , professor ? " Al asked from the pro-shop door . " Yes , " Henry said quietly . Al tapped the face of his watch and glanced at Charlie . " Three hours . That 's movin ' ' em , " he said . Unaware of the compliment , Henry thumbed a page or two , found his spot and held it with a finger . Sensing Charlie , he greeted him with a bashful nod , sighed contentedly , and began to read . An hour passed , then another . Noon approached and cars began to roll in , each caddy knowing every car and the member who drove it . A trunk popped open and a thin , baby-faced kid in his twenties with shaggy brown hair and freckles jumped up and ran to it . His sudden movement sent a ripple of head-shaking and snickers down the bench , but that had no effect on him . He retrieved the bag , set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his spot on the bench and , like a beagle eyeing a rabbit , waited for the next car . " Stop pressin ' , Billy , " someone said from behind a newspaper . " It 's fuckin ' embarrassing . " " Fuck you , Figgs , " he replied . " Starin ' at the parking lot do n't make ' em come down the road . " " Some of us do n't have steadies like you . " Jimmy Figgs folded the paper exposing his narrow , mean face . " You been here since you were a kid . You do n't have steadies , you 're a duck . " " Leave that boy alone , " someone mumbled .
