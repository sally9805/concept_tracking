Why rise before the sun to pedal your hike up and up tor three , or five , or eight hours in late summer 's swelter ? To reach the 7,780-foot-elevation finish of California 's Mount Shasta Summit Century ( **29;4317;TOOLONG ; 130 , 100 , 60 or 30 miles ) . No matter your age or experience , or how many water bottles or tubes of sunscreen you go through , traversing the southern Cascade peaks along the route feels like you 're riding above the world . Sidebar U.S. POSTAL CARRIER , 60 MILES We rode tandem , my rear admiral-Eleanor-and I. It was hot , so the finish line was nice , but the shower afterward was even better .

MORGAN BONAR , 23 STUDENT , 100 MILES I joined the ride because my friends were going-there were 10 of us . The sun beat down on us , and we were exhausted by the final climb , but I think centuries are most grueling on the behind . 1 . ELEANOR MARK , 63 GRANDMOTHER , 60 MILES It 's a constant head trip . At once you 're riding in the most beautiful place on Earth and realizing that the 10-12-percent grade goes on for 4 more miles . 2 ROBERT " DIESEL " JACOB , 48 SALES REP , 100 MILES The last climb was the worst , but the best was the 55mph final downhill . 3 .

PATRICK LANDRUM , 41 MECHANICAL ENGINEER , 100 MILES The highway is a line in the trees , and the town is a dusting of sand in a forest . 7 . MONICA RUDMAN , 42 ENERGY SPECIALIST , 60 MILES Waking up and staying hydrated were the hardest parts . I 'm not a morning person , truth be told . BILL SURGES , 36 CARPENTER , 130 MILES I logged 180 to 240 miles per week to prepare , and it paid off . This is the type of ride that helps me get more satisfaction from cycling than from any other facet of life . // <p>      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
