When seventh period is finally over , I run to my locker and put all my books inside . I won ? t need them anymore . I grab my lock-picking set and a spare Ace of Spades that I have lying around . // At the end of the hallway , I can see Stephen talking to Megan , the girl we both have a crush on . I walk up to them and say hi . She smiles at me and I try to smile back . He looks a little suspicious . // I don ? t really want to say anything , I don ? t want to tell them what I ? m going to do . I hand him the Ace of Spades and say , " Good-bye , " and I walk away . I hope they ? ll be happy together . // I see my friend Jake at his locker and give him the lock-picking set . " Use them wisely , " I say , and head toward the bus . // Laura walks with me down D @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you set that fire in gym class . " // " Yeah . " // " What are you going to do ? " // " I ? m going to set myself on fire . " She stops at her locker , and I keep walking . // On the bus ride home , I sit by myself . I lean my head against the cold glass window and try not to think about all the stupid things I ? ve done , all the bad things I ? ve done , and all the pain I ? ve caused everyone . // My brother is playing basketball outside the house when I get home . He ? s shooting free throws . // I rebound the ball for him and throw it back . I don ? t want to take any shots . I tell him the whole story , about what I did and what they ? re going to do to me . I don ? t tell him what I ? m going to do to myself . // When I ? m done talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I go inside the house . I don ? t have to write a note anymore . Craig knows everything . // I walk out to the shed to get the gas can . I bring it inside to the bathroom at the top of the stairs because that ? s the room with the most locks . I go back downstairs and get the matches from the kitchen . // I take off all my clothes and put on the pair of red boxers with glow-in-the-dark lips that my mom bought for me at the mall last weekend . I bring my bathrobe into the shower and I pour the gasoline all over it . The gas can is only about a quarter full , but it seems like enough . // I step into the bathtub and I put the bathrobe over my shoulders . It ? s wet and heavy , but there ? s something kind of comforting about the smell , like going on a long car trip . I hold the box of matches out in front of me in my left hand . // @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the box . // Should I do it ? // Yes . Do it . // I strike the match , but it doesn ? t light . Try again . // I light the match . Nothing happens . I bring it closer to my wrist and then it goes up , all over me , eating through me everywhere . I can ? t breathe . I ? m screaming , " Craig ! Craig ! " // I fall down . I ? m going to die . I ? m going to find out what death is like . I ? m going to know . But nothing ? s happening . // This hurts too much . I need to stop it . I need to get up . I stand . I don ? t know how I stand , but I do , and I turn on the shower . I ? m breathing water and smoke . I unlock the door and open it . My hand is all black . I walk out . There ? s Craig with Rusty , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expression on their faces . // Craig yells something and runs downstairs . I think he ? s calling 911 . I ? m following him . He hands me the phone and runs off . There ? s a woman on the phone asking me questions . I try to tell her what ? s happened , but my voice sounds choked and brittle . There ? s something wrong with my voice . // The woman on the phone says the fire trucks and ambulances are on their way . Somehow she knows my address . Craig is gone now , gone to get Mom , and Rusty is hiding somewhere . Smoke is coming from the bathroom upstairs and I can see that the whole room has turned black . I look down and see my flesh is charred and flaking and the glow-in-the-dark boxer shorts are burnt into my skin . // The woman on the phone says everything is going to be all right , and I believe her . She has a nice voice . She keeps asking me if I ? m still on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think so . " // I ? m walking around the kitchen , waiting for the ambulance to come . I can see my reflection in the microwave . Where ? s my hair ? Where did my hair go ? Is that my face ? // We used to put marshmallows in the microwave . We used to watch them get bigger and bigger and then shrink down . // " Oh God , just tell them to get here , just tell them to get here , okay ? " // She says , " It ? s okay . They ? re coming . They ? re almost there . " // " I ? m so sorry . I ? m so sorry . " // " It ? s okay , that ? s okay . " // I can hear the sirens in the distance now . // I say , " I want to lie down . I ? m going to lie down . " It hurts to talk . I think there ? s something wrong in my throat . // " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I have to . " // " Okay , you can lie down . " // The men are here . The firemen are here . They ? re putting me on a plastic sheet . They say I ? m going to be okay . One of them puts something over my face . That feels good . That feels so good . The cold air feels so good going into my lungs . // What are they talking about ? What are they saying ? They ? re giving me a shot . They say it ? s going to make the pain go away . Make the pain go away . // I ? m looking at the faces of all the men who are gathered around me . Their eyes are so blue and so clear . // I turn my head and see Craig in the front hall . He ? s yelling and punching the walls . He ? s angry . // And my mom is here , and she ? s smiling and saying she loves me , and her eyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful things I ? ve ever seen . //
