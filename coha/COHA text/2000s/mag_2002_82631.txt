Continental Divide Michael Schumacher is filthy rich  --  and good  --  but the appeal of his sport is still largely foreign to Americans // On his way to qualifying for the U.S. Grand Prix , the world 's highest-paid athlete weaved through the garage not in a Ferrari but on a motorized scooter , stopping only to good-naturedly kick his younger brother , Ralf , in the seat of his pants . Then he went out and kicked the butts of the other 20 F/1 drivers , putting his car on the pole for Sunday 's race , which he would dominate before letting his teammate , Rubens Barrichello , pass him on the final turn to win the race . ( Afterward Schumacher slyly insisted , " There was no plan , " despite the fact that Barrichello had , under Ferrari team orders , done the same for him at the Austrian Grand Prix in May. ) // The 33-year-old German can afford to be so generous . He has already won 10 times in 16 F/1 races this year , and he clinched his fifth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ months ago . If he has n't already established that he 's the greatest racer ever , he 's building a pretty fair case for himself . // Yet for all his wizardry on the track and the outrageous fortune he 's earned as a result ( $40 million in salary alone this year ) , Schumacher appears unlikely to achieve anything close to the level of megastardom Stateside that he enjoys in Europe . The estimated crowd of 125,000 ( some 50,000 fewer than last year ) at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway suggested that the sport has already peaked in the U.S. // That 's just fine with Schumacher , who reveled in his semi-anonymity during F/1 's sole U.S. stop . " I love this country , being able to walk around freely and watch people , " he says . " They always watch me in other countries , but I like to watch them as well . " // Schumacher stopped in California to visit friends for a few days before heading to Indy . While on the West Coast he was amazed that the only people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mostly cooks , " he says . ) When he got to Indianapolis , which had been overrun by F/1 fans , that was n't the case . Three nights before the race , as he sat in the posh Canterbury hotel  --  outside of which gawkers had gathered  --  he said , " I would be happy not to become as famous in the States as I am in Europe . " And with that he took his leave and asked a hotel employee in a tuxedo to show him out the back door . // Junior 's Concussion NASCAR Needs A Head Exam // When Dale Earnhardt Jr . admitted last week that he drove for the better part of two months while suffering the aftereffects of a concussion , the most significant question was n't , What was Junior thinking ? Rather it was , How come no one in NASCAR knew about his condition ? According to race officials , the April wreck in which Earnhardt sustained the concussion was one of the hardest hits NASCAR has recorded since it began using telemetry in cars last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more rigorously check any driver who 's involved in a wreck before he 's cleared to drive again . Its next step should be to follow the lead of CART and the IRL by employing a single medical team to travel the circuit . ( NASCAR medical teams now vary from track to track . ) Having the same doctors see drivers on a regular basis would make it much harder for a driver to hide an injury . // Changing the points system may also deter injured drivers from racing . Because points are awarded to every car in the field , a driver ca n't afford to miss even a few starts . F/1 , CART and the IRL do n't award points to half the field , so there 's no difference between a bad finish and not starting . Under such a system a driver who knows his ability to perform is compromised is more likely to admit an injury that might cause him to sit out a race . NASCAR likes to boast that its points system rewards consistency . It should n't , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
