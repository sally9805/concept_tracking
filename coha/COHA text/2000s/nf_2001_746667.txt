A Parent 's Perspective <p> Teaching today may be more difficult than it has ever been . Children still go through the critical stages that children have always gone through to attempt to establish who they are and to grow into what they can become ( Santrock 1987 ) . The difference these days is that children go through these stages at faster paces and with different types of adult guidance ( Elkind 1994 ) . Whether it is because of the media , the lack of parent involvement , the dearth of traditional families , or simply an adult-centered society , teachers often end up with classes filled with too many students with too many problems . Students seem to have difficulty in personal and logical progression through normal child developmental stages , such as the realization of self-worth , productivity , and the establishment of identity . Teachers end up trying to deal with this difficult situation . In this article I will share what , in spite of all of the above , many parents still hope for in their children 's teachers . <p> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do care deeply about their children 's success in school . The myth of a lack of caring parents in America today often overshadows , perhaps obliterates , the fact that in all communities many , if not most , parents want to work with teachers for the benefit of their children ( Willis 1993 ) . And these parents genuinely want to go beyond fundraising and cheerleading to serious relationships with teachers about their children . They do not all have the " My kid 's got ta go to Harvard " mentality ; they just care about their children having a good experience in school . <p> As a parent of school-aged children , I have attempted to be supportive of my children 's school experience . In doing this , I have attempted to be supportive of teachers , administrators , school programs , district initiatives , and education in general . To this end , I have regularly communicated with teachers , administrators , program coordinators , school board members , and other parents regarding educational progress in our community and for my children . After ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of curricular and cocurricular programs , I have experienced both the extreme joy of a genuine sense of partnership and an empty sense of detachment . I have come to care deeply about strengthening the connection between teacher and parents in a way that achieves the mutual goal of providing children with the greatest chance for school and life success . For I have learned that the key to my children 's success in school is the competence and professionalism of classroom teachers and the communication that develops between nay children 's teachers and me . In an effort to define this issue more clearly , I offer the descriptions below to form a portrait of what I hope for in my children 's teachers . Enthusiastic , Energetic , Happy , Positive <p> Nothing works better to get students excited about school than a teacher who loves teaching and learning . I want my children 's teachers to be enthusiastic about school , about learning , and about what goes on in class so they can carry , on the joy of learning we have already started and continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overt and obvious , genuine , not feigned . <p> It takes energy to be enthusiastic . It takes energy , to teach . Teaching is an active profession , and I hope my children 's teachers are healthy enough both physically and mentally to have the energy for planned and spontaneous enthusiastic activity , because this energy , is conveyed to the students . In school , if the teachers are happy , my children will be happy ( Boers 1995 ) . Conversely , if the teachers are not happy , negative things can happen . The mission of all teachers should center on fostering happy , well-adjusted children who will grow up to be happy , well-adjusted adults . If my children 's teachers are not happy at school , I worry , about their working with my children . If my children 's teachers are happy at school , I see unlimited potential for all kinds of spontaneous learning . <p> Enthusiasm , energy , and happiness contribute to creating a positive environment , one in which children 's basic needs  --  physiological needs , safety and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Santrock 1987 )  --  are met , as are additional needs for power , freedom , and fun ( Glasser 1990 ) . A positive environment leads to greater curiosity , greater production , and higher levels of thinking . When students are empowered as valued decision makers in the classroom , the classroom is much more conducive to achievement and retention because it is a positive place to be ( Glasser 1993 ) . For those reasons , I hope nay children 's teachers are positive leaders . Competent , Research-Based , Well-Read , Confident <p> I hope my children 's teachers have a high degree of competency in the knowledge of human growth , development , and learning . I hope that they can appropriately apply methods and strategies for dealing with children in all ways , not just academically . For example , teachers know full well that children grow , develop , and learn in different ways and through individual processes . Teachers must then have the competence to perceive student levels and provide direction and instruction beginning at those levels . If my children are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the teacher 's behavioral directions and instructional techniques need to be different for them . In this case , perhaps my children would need more specific directions and more direct instruction . <p> I hope my children 's teachers teach from a reputable base of qualified research  --  that at any time , they can cite notable researchers and theorists to justify , what they are saying or doing . For example , if methods such as assertive discipline ( Canter 1986 ) or control theory ( Glasser 1986 ) were used , I would be interested in knowing that teachers understand the research that supports those methods and are able to explain the psychology of the process that leads to the expected results . Academically , if teachers use theories of multiple intelligences ( Gardner 1983 ) , they ought to know and understand and be able to explain the human growth , development , and learning principles that are inherent in the strategies . In other words , I would prefer that teachers know what they are doing and understand why they are doing it . <p> Teaching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's teachers read professional journals and books so that they can understand , use , and talk about current knowledge and practice . Understanding current knowledge about the brain ( Jensen 1998 ) or quality school teaching ( Glasser 1993 ) is vital to the effective delivery of instruction . Children , schools , and teaching are very widely studied and written about , with the hope that what occurs at school makes sense for student progress . There are no professions left that can " do it the way we 've always done it . " Therefore , it is important that teachers regularly read , understand , and apply ideas that work , as reported in contemporary professional writings . <p> I hope that my children 's teachers are confident enough to listen and respond professionally to my questions and challenges , not in grudge-match fashion , but as a matter of two-way intellectualizing for the benefit of students . If my children 's teachers can confidently ( not brashly ) carry on a two-way conversation , they will model the same in the classroom . Confidence leads to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will serve as a good model for my children 's learning . Personable , Communicative , Respectful , Welcoming <p> I hope my children 's teachers get to know who we are as a family . They should understand our family 's lifestyle and goals . For example , I 'd like teachers to know that we take learning and school seriously , expect to do difficult work , and want to be challenged constantly . I will willingly share our family 's joys , happiness , and sorrows with my children 's teachers if given the chance . From this , I hope that my children 's teachers know how my children think and act and live their lives , so they can avoid jumping to conclusions and help find possibilities and connections for my children . Teachers teach my children best when they personally know my children . <p> I hope my children 's teachers communicate with me eagerly , early , and regularly via notes , telephone calls , e-mail . I want to know how my children are doing and how things are going . I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advice regarding my children 's growth and progress . When teachers know and care about my children and me personally , they should be eager to share whatever they know about us . Teachers have the advantage of being in school , a place where my children spend a tremendous amount of time , so they know what is going on in that part of my children 's life . Teachers ' communicating what they observe is an important learning tool for parents . <p> I hope my children 's teachers are respectful of me as a parent partner . If my ideas and values are different from the teachers ' , they can still be heard , pondered , considered , and perhaps implemented . <p> In the best-case scenario my children 's teachers would know me well enough to seek me out and use me as a resource . I will hang bulletin boards and supervise game day activities but would also ask that teachers use me as a guest teacher in areas of curriculum in which I have appropriate knowledge . When I take the initiative to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up on the offer and even consider creating situations where I might be involved . Student-Centered , Differentiating , Homework-Efficient , Work-Responsive <p> I hope my children 's classrooms are student-centered , as opposed to teacher-centered or even subject-centered . My children are more important to me than social studies , foreign language , or any academic area . But I also know that when a teacher focuses on the student as a learner ( rather than on the teacher as teacher ) , more achievement and more retention in academic endeavors occur . This is a result of increased ownership of academic material on the part of students . Student-centered classrooms have the additional advantage of increasing the opportunities for developing caring , compassionate students who see every , person as a valuable individual ( Kohn 1996 , 101-19 ) . I want my children and all the children they are with to be caring , compassionate people . <p> When my children 's teachers use a multiple-modality approach that allows for different approaches to instruction ( Holloway 2000 ) , it gives my children options of different ways to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key concepts graphically rather than in writing , they should have that opportunity . One-dimensional teaching will not accommodate my children 's learning styles . This includes differentiation through assessments that are meaningful and authentic . <p> I hope teachers will call on my children and expect them to perform every day as a natural part of being in school . If homework is assigned , I hope that it is worth doing , clearly explained , and connected to the curriculum . Otherwise , homework can become drudgery that makes school unpleasant and unappealing ( Gratz 2000 ) . My children 's teachers can encourage , via meaningful homework , my children 's love for school . <p> Effective time management is critical for teachers . It permits them to return work in a timely fashion with specific , meaningful teacher comments . I know that my children have the teacher in mind when they do the work . They want and need to know soon whether they have met the requirements , exceeded the requirements , or have work left to do . If in fact teachers are abiding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to know in a timely fashion how they are doing to better connect it to where they have been and where they are going . Well-Planned , Conferencing-Complete , Honest , Holistic <p> My children 's teachers need to know where they are going and how that fits into everything else taught and learned in previous years , as well as all that will follow in ensuing years . If that is too much to ask , then teachers should at least have a clear set of goals and strategies for the entire school year and for each day of that year . This does not prevent spontaneity related to course goals . Further , I hope that my children 's teachers have a vision for an integrated set of school learning experiences , if not across the curriculum and cocurriculum every day in school , then at least with each teacher 's own course offerings . I hope my children 's teachers will not force them to learn in small , isolated , nonintegrated units , one after another , all year long . All students deserve teachers with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school is desired , and that every day is connected to the last one . <p> I hope my children 's teachers have a specific , detailed plan for our conferences that goes beyond merely presenting grades . Handing out a computerized list of scores may be a start , but the teacher is so much more involved with my children 's lives than to be one-dimensional in conferencing . I want to know about skill levels , academic performance , social skills , and personal happiness . I hope my children 's teachers will tell me how they assess my children in those four areas . <p> I hope my children 's teachers are honest about who they are , how they teach , and how they are working with my children . Honest teachers eliminate the see-through camouflage of teacherese or systemic games that sometimes block the path to what is best for students . Honest teachers allow for an authentic discussion and a focused collaboration in educational partnerships . <p> I believe that my children 's teachers need to have an understanding of the school experience , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bigger whole . Teachers should support special school events such as homecoming , harvest moon celebration , multicultural awareness week , and so on , by being involved themselves and by reducing or eliminating homework so that students are encouraged to become involved . Further , most districts have at least an unwritten agreement to reduce work on a specific evening so that children may attend religious education . It is important that teachers honor such agreements . <p> These are the hopes that I have for my children 's teachers . I know that I am not alone in these hopes . Concerned parents love school . We want to be partners in education , and we very much respect the difficulties of being a teacher . In my experience , model teachers demonstrate the characteristics I have described in their professional approach to their important responsibility . I hope that all teachers reflect on their classrooms , contemplate refining their skills , and ponder their attitudes in making the educational experiences of all of their students the very best possible . Parents want the best for their children @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knowledgeable teachers as they work with the sometimes difficult classroom conditions that exist in our schools . <p> Key words : teachers , parent expectations , characteristics , student-teacher relationships <p>
