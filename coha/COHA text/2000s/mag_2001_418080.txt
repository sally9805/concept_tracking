Pulling up to this Indiana homestead , he felt a deep twinge of nostalgia for his grandparents ' upstate New York farmstead and bought the property without ever having set foot inside the main house . Dan and Jerry became not only the owners of this 1820s Federal-style brick home but also the heirs to all of its go-withs : two barns , a summer kitchen , and 10 acres of land to tend an organic garden and some 30 animals-cats , dogs , goats , merino sheep , turkeys , and guinea hens among them . Being an artist , says Dan , afforded him the freedom to move to the country as well as the opportunity to live life amid natural beauty .
