Section : AMERICA 'S LARGEST PRIVATE COMPANIES Solo Cup was once a proud business . After a bungled acquisition and poor management , it 's a shambles <p> The private corporation is often trumpeted as the ideal vehicle for commerce . Not distracted by investors clamoring for quarterly earnings gains , so goes the argument , its managers can focus on long-term strategy . But there 's something to be said for being public . The visibility of the results and the possibility that an independently minded board will ax the boss may make it less likely that deep problems will go uncorrected for years . <p> Consider the recent history of Solo Cup , a manufacturer of disposable beverage cups . An era came to an end in mid-August , when Robert L. Hulseman , the 74-year-old chief executive and son of the founder , turned the company over to a nonfamily member . Hulseman had been at the $2.4 billion ( sales ) packaging manufacturer for half a century , starting out as a machine operator , then a plant manager . He also presided over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ haunted by accounting irregularities and poor management . <p> The new chief executive is Robert M. Korzenski , 52 , who had spent a decade at competitor Sweetheart Cup . " It 's a very humbling experience " to take over a storied company , he says , diplomatically . " I could n't be more charged up about the opportunity . " <p> Or more daunted , perhaps , at having to make such extensive repairs . Until two years ago the Hulseman family owned all of Solo Cup , as it had since 1936 . But in 2004 the Highland Park , Ill. firm bought Sweetheart , in part , with public debt  --  which opens a financial window on an otherwise well-cloaked company . In its latest filing , for the quarter ended July 2 , Solo reported a $299 million loss on $670 million in sales . It has been operating with bank waivers that expire in January and is struggling with $1.1 billion in debt . In mid-September Moody 's lowered credit ratings on its bonds and an $80 million loan . Despite the bleak times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family generous salaries . ( The family declined repeated requests for comment . ) <p> Solo Cup was founded 70 years ago as the Paper Container Manufacturing Co. by Leo Hulseman , a former employee of the Dixie Co . He created the " Solo Cup , " a paper cone he made in his garage and peddled to bottled-water producers . Then came wax-coated cups , as well as the plastic " Cozy Cup , " a regular in office kitchenettes , replacing ceramic mugs . Solo 's indestructible red plastic cup showed up in the 1970s , when Solo also diversified into disposable plates and bowls . Diversification took other forms . In 1971 Leo reportedly paid $400,000 for his wife , a singer and actress with the stage name " Dora Hall , " to be featured in a TV special called Once Upon a Tour , where the then grandmother sang with Frank Sinatra Jr. , among others . ( Rejected by the networks , the show was distributed by a syndication company . ) Hulseman also distributed free Dora Hall records with Solo Cup products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried , for example , to increase revenue by encouraging kids to use its cups at lemonade stands . But it also had plenty of big accounts . It sold cups to McDonald 's , Yum Brands and Starbucks . Leo Hulseman died in 1989 ; Robert took over in 1998 . Two-plus years ago , Hulseman had a chance to pick off his old nemesis . Another tightly controlled family business , Sweetheart , was founded by Joseph Shapiro and his four brothers , who emigrated from Russia , and became the largest food-service disposable packaging company in the world . Then , bouncing from one new owner to another , it fell on bruising times . ( In 2003 it netted $6 million on $1.3 billion in sales . ) " Sweetheart was always bigger and better , and it just rankled , " says a person involved in the acquisition by Solo . The deal closed in February 2004 for $917 million . It seemed a smart move , giving Solo access to Sweetheart 's broad , in-house network of trucks , distribution centers and warehouses serving mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be the clear market leader in disposable food ware . <p> There were problems from the start . Solo had only limited deal-making experience , with smaller acquisitions in the U.K. and Japan . According to one person involved in the acquisition , Solo vastly overpaid its investment bankers and sources of capital . Hulseman turned many discussions over to his president Ronald Whaley , 52 , who left in April to " spend more time with his family . " Whaley says , through his lawyers : " I enjoyed my 23 years of employment at Solo Cup , and I am proud of the company 's accomplishments during that time . " Still , he okayed $21 million in payments to get out of a contract to a distribution company it had signed up in 2001 . <p> To buy Sweetheart , Solo had to bring in outside investors , sacrifice its long held privacy and agree to stiff terms . Vestar Capital Partners , a New York LBO firm , put up $240 million . It got convertible preferred stock in the combined company and took two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an option to convert its holdings into 32.7% of Solo Cup common . If Solo failed to meet certain commitments , Vestar could elect a majority to the board . Solo also took out $650 million in bank loans and issued $325 million in senior subordinated notes at 8.5% due in 2014 . <p> The company stumbled out of the gate . Bondholders had hoped to see $20 million in pro forma operating income ( Ebitda , that is ) in the first quarter of consolidated results , ended Mar. 31 , 2004 . Instead , Solo reported on a pro forma basis $10 million in operating income on $495 million in sales . One bondholder blames the shock not on operating foul-ups but on communications problems : Solo could have shaped expectations by explaining cyclical bumps in the business ( paper plates sell better in the summer ) to investors . <p> Solo and Sweetheart used different software to enter everything from placing and receiving orders to recording delivery dates . But after two and a half years , a battery of consultants , a new chief information officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other . Customers who bought from both Solo and Sweetheart continue to treat the combined company as separate vendors . Solo sends out multiple invoices and trucks , an expensive inefficiency that multiplied with a jump in fuel prices . Chief Exec Korzenski says a new system will be in place early next year . <p> Rising raw material costs compounded the pain . Last year Solo 's cost of goods was 17% higher than the year before ; for the first half of 2006 the price of plastic resin was up 51% and of polystyrene 12% . With prices of petroleum derivates now falling , Solo hopes to see some relief . <p> During a mid-October conference call to bondholders , Korzenski spoke of trying to instill a " performance-based culture " at Solo . That would be a shock to a company accustomed to family favoritism . Last year Robert Hulseman drew a $1.1 million salary . His brother John , vice chairman of a subsidiary , drew the same . Eleven of the brothers ' children were paid a total $206,000 in " consulting " fees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Richard , Robert 's son-in-law Joseph Kovach , and John 's sons James and John were also on the payroll pulling in a collective $1.8 million . On top of that the family collected " advisory " fees totaling $4.5 million over the last two years . It split $32 million or so in dividends from 2002 to 2004 ( it no longer receives them ) . " Once you have public debt holders , you have to have more heightened sensitivity to those issues , " says an executive who was involved in the Sweetheart transaction . " It 's not a personal cookie jar anymore . " <p> But Korzenski has no plans to halt the gravy train . " I would never specifically say you would target employees based on their family spot , " he says , adding that he will reexamine all company expenses . Paying Hulseman family members " is not the reason the company has not performed , " says Daniel O'Connell , a partner at Vestar and a member of Solo 's board of directors . " They have been good employers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-Hulsemans handsomely . Last year , as president and chief operating officer , Ron Whaley drew $1.3 million in salary and bonus and had a $1.7 million interest-free loan . His perks included $103,000 for vacations and $104,000 for use of an aircraft . O'Connell has n't done shabbily , either : Vestar , which had put up money for the deal , collected advisory fees of $800,000 last year and $4 million in 2004 . Its convertible stock accrues 10% annual dividends . O'Connell says that Vestar 's fees are appropriate . <p> Perhaps . But Solo has n't been generating enough cash to cover its debt payments . Its free cash flow ( in the sense of cash from operations , less capital expenses ) last year was negative $50 million , forcing Solo to dip into a credit line to help pay its bills . Its annual interest expense is $72 million . In March 2006 it secured another $80 million term loan , bringing its long-term debt to a total $1 billion . Solo has renegotiated terms with lenders . Korzenski insists Solo will be able to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has been cleaning house . In July Chief Financial Officer Susan Marks departed after seven years " to pursue other interests . " The company maintains both she and Whaley resigned . Still , Whaley has sued , claiming he was forced out in violation of breach of contract . <p> After Korzenski took over , he ordered a thorough review of the books . That has led to an internal investigation that uncovered 12 accounting errors spanning five years . In July the company took a $330 million writedown , two-thirds of that a noncash charge to goodwill related to the acquisition . " Obviously the company 's not done a stellar job on the integration , " says O'Connell . " The prior management was not up to the task . " <p> Korzenski is eyeing every department and its spending as part of the reorganization . Some overlapping products , he says , will be eliminated , while new snack plates , bowls and a 54-ounce cold cup for movie theaters come onstream . Korzenski also suspects that some plants can be run more efficiently . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the 230 people in Solo 's sales force . <p> Can this old company right itself ? A large institutional investor in Solo Cup bonds says he 's holding on , hoping that Korzenski 's operational experience and Vestar 's restructuring know-how can pull it out of the fire . " If they ca n't get this thing right , it 's not a good situation , " he says . He does acknowledge feeling burned by the size of the restatement . " The credibility is gone a little bit , " he says , but adds that he 's still optimistic . <p> PHOTO ( COLOR ) <p> By Emily Lambert <p>
