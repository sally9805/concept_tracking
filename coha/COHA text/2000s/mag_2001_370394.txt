When Daimler-Benz , the maker of Mercedes , took over Chrysler three years ago , it argued that globalization demanded not just speed but also size . Selling dozens of models in every price range , the reasoning went , was the only way a car company could afford the huge investments necessary to incorporate the latest technologies . That meant that if you were a small independent , you would have to merge  --  or face the Darwinian consequences . So Daimler coupled with Chrysler , Renault bought Nissan , Ford scooped up Volvo , and everybody mused that it was just a matter of time before the biggies gobbled up BMW and Honda , and maybe even Porsche . Yet here we are in 2001 , and among the most successful players in the auto industry are ... BMW , Honda and Porsche . <P> Jurgen Schrempp , the once swaggering chairman of DaimlerChrysler , is praying that the billions of dollars in losses at Chrysler and Mitsubishi ( in which he bought a ruling share last year ) do n't sink the entire company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his stable : Aston Martin , Jaguar , Land Rover and Volvo . But amid a weak economy , sales at Ford and GM are down some 15% this year , and even the luxury brands are under new pressure from smaller Japanese and German automakers . <P> At BMW headquarters in Munich , you would never know there was a downturn . First-quarter sales set records , and April sales soared 30% over last year 's numbers . In North America , BMW overtook Mercedes for the first time . BMW executives have announced a plan to expand their selection to 76 models from 70 . They expect to sell 200,000 units , up from 189,423 , and increase their share of the luxury-car market . " I can not recall ever having seen such a clear correlation between size and success , " BMW chairman Joachim Milberg wryly told a Detroit audience . " At the moment , it seems the greater the size , the more the problems . " <P> Yet it seems that only hours ago , most auto execs and industry analysts agreed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and local labor crises . They also agreed that a company had to produce about 2 million vehicles a year to achieve necessary economies of scale . Schrempp still insists that buying Chrysler gives Daimler the mass-market heft  --  and the profits  --  necessary to keep developing the cool features that make Mercedes buyers drool . <P> Schrempp may be proved right over the next decade . But what 's decisive now is not so much size as ( surprise ! ) sound management . Which car company is nimble enough to hop in and out of new market niches and still provide high-quality , sexy cars that people aspire to own ? Mike Flynn , an auto expert at the University of Michigan , observes that new technology is only one of the elements  --  including styling and reliability  --  that make a car attractive . " Companies like BMW and Honda , " he says , " offer products that keep them successful . " So does Porsche , where sales are soaring 16% so far this year . It produces a mere 48,815 cars a year  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
