YOU THINK IT 'S EASY LIVING in the garden ? The never-ending picnic - that 's what your Bible says , does n't it ? That the people who live here just stroll around petting tigers and helping themselves to the Gardener 's own salad bar ? Oh , and having lots of sloppy , guiltless sex . Being fruitful . Multiplying . Why not ? They 've got nothing better to do . They have no checkbooks to balance , no periodic table to memorize . No poker or e-mail or National Enquirer . <p> Possibly you 're surprised that there are still people in the garden . That is n't in your book , is it ? Well , things have changed here since your lot got shown the gate . The Gardener decided to try again , except that He tinkered with His design this time around . Take sex , for instance . The Gardener made sex less fun - more like brushing your teeth with baking soda than eating dark chocolate with almonds . And He must have decided that there was something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all your exaggerated curves and bulges . The innocents - they like to call themselves that , can you believe it ? - are hermaphrodites . Everyone 's got the same equipment , although it comes in a variety of sizes . And of course , nudity is not a problem for this batch ; they are covered with a delicate , flat down that is more like feathers than hair . <p> The innocents are better stewards of the garden than you were . It 's because the Gardener gave them peculiarly moral imaginations . Their art is n't worth much , but they see consequences around a corner and a mile away . They compost and practice sound forest management . When they slaughter an animal , they use just about all of it . They prefer horse to cow , antelope to deer . I 'd say they like their meat stringy , except recently they 've developed a taste for dodo . I claim credit for that-I 'm not entirely helpless here . They do n't eat fish , though , and have some odd notions about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ although they take a pessimistic view of the afterlife . Too wet . Stings the eyes . I think they must get this from the angels . <p> I 'm always telling them things about you that the angels leave out - all that you 've accomplished . The fantasy trilogy . Penicillin . Titanium-framed bicycles . I keep up by eating of the Tree of Knowledge . It 's better than the Internet . Of course , the angels insist on showing them all your mistakes , rehearsing the entire catalogue of your sins . Me , I 'm willing to accept your sins ; they 're part of who you are . But to the innocents , you 're Tuesday 's leftovers . Ready for the compost pile . The angels have promised them that someday the Gardener will smite you all down and then the innocents will inherit the Earth . <p> So I 'm tempting **28;1745;TOOLONG , who is double-digging a new vegetable garden next to her house in Overhill . She has a broad , stolid face and has painted her ears blue . She sings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a two-foot square of soil into her wheelbarrow , then turns and breaks the square of earth beneath it . I decide to start with a joke . I 've never heard an innocent laugh out loud , but they will smile if they 're in the mood and say , " That 's funny . " The innocents understand more than you might expect , considering that they 're basically living in the Late Iron Age . <p> This hiker is climbing a mountain when the trail she 's on gives way and she slides down a steep slope that ends in a sheer cliff . Just as she goes over the edge , she clutches at a scrub pine . It holds but she finds herself dangling over a thousand-foot drop . <p> Arms aching , she calls out , " Is there anyone up there ! " <p> She gets no answer . <p> She screams . " Oh god , is there anyone up there ? " <p> " I AM , " says a voice that cracks like lightning . <p> Despite her desperate situation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Who is that ? " <p> " I AM . " Now the voice roars like the sea . <p> " God , is that you ! " she cries . " Will you help me ! " <p> " Yes . But first you must let go . " <p> " Let go ! " she says , glancing down at the jagged rocks below her . " Why ? " <p> " To show your faith in Me . If you let go , God will catch you up . " <p> The hiker thinks this over , then calls out . " Is there anyone else up there ! " <p> **28;1775;TOOLONG leans on her shovel and stares at me with her pale yellow eyes . " I know what you 're trying to do . " <p> " Do you ? " <p> " Have you heard of long line fishing boats ? " she says . " They catch tuna using lines up to thirty miles long that carry thousands of hooks . Except seabirds and sharks and turtles get entangled in them , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade of the shovel into the soil and turns a new square . " And tunas are overfished , the population is less than a third of what it was thirty years ago . " <p> The angels , again . I do n't have to see them to know that they 're everywhere . They give the innocents visions of your world and feed them all these meaningless numbers . <p> " You do n't even like fish , " I say . " You would n't know a tuna if one fell out of a tree and hit you on the head . " <p> She shakes that off and then scoops leaf mold into the bed . " Then there 's the Glen Canyon Dam . " She tips the soil in the wheelbarrow back into the garden . " Flooded one of the most beautiful places on Earth . For what ? " She pulls a rake across the soil , leveling the surface . " The intakes are silting in so it 'll be useless by the end of the century . Meanwhile they lose almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seepage . " <p> " Actually , it 's only 882,000 . " I try to stay calm . " And people just love Lake Powell . " <p> She drops to her knees and runs hands over the ground as if blessing it . She flicks a pebble away . <p> " Two million Armenians were killed in the Middle East . " <p> It always comes to this eventually . " There 's no way of knowing exactly ... , " I begin . <p> " Six million Jews in Europe . " <p> I coil myself . I know when I 'm beaten . <p> " One point seven million Cambodians in Asia . " <p> " What are you planting ? " I say . <p> She reaches into the horsehide pouch slung from her hip . Three brown tubers bump against one another as the muscles in her hand work . " Maybe choke . " She grins . " Maybe potato . What do you think ? " <p> That 's the thing about the innocents . Everyone 's opinion gets heard and considered carefully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , come to consensus . Might take them ten minutes , might take a month . They 're as patient as trees . They never bicker or get angry . Nobody hold grudges . I 've never seen any of them throw a punch . Oh , and they 're the most polite drunks in history , although the cloudy brew they make from stale bread mash is so vile that I do n't know how they can bear it . Since nothing important ever happens in the garden , they have no history . Instead they have seasons - planting and harvest . Birth and death . They 're dull as dirt . That 's why they 're so fascinated by you . You burn with unholy fire , my children . <p> You are mine , by the way . Maybe the Gardener created you , but I made you think for the first time . I 've been fascinated by what you 've accomplished since - the sublime and the monstrous . I take no credit , and accept no blame . I just gave you that little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm evil . Why ? Because I pointed you toward the Tree of Knowledge ? Remember what Socrates said ? The unexamined life is not worth living . <p> I laughed when the Gardener squeezed dust again and came up with these simple creatures . Me , I would have torn up the garden . But I 'll admit I was confused at first . What was the Gardener thinking ? Of course , He does n't share His plan with the likes of me . Hey , I 'm not even sure the Gardener exists . I infer that this is the case , but the Gardener has never bothered manifesting in my comer of the garden . For that matter , I 've never seen angels either , although the innocents talk of them all the time . But why did n't the Gardener just cancel out your Original So-Called Sin ? Press the undo key ? It took me a while to figure this out . <p> You see , reality is a cage . I 'm in it . So are you , Vladimir Putin , Joyce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Archangel Uriel . But here 's the kicker : the Gardener must be trapped in our cage too . He 's not bigger than our cage , nor did he make it . The Gardener ca n't exceed the speed of light or divide by zero . He did n't set off the Big Bang or charm the quarks . The Gardener is not almighty . He might be powerful enough to create you and me , powerful enough sweep all of you away like ants off a picnic table . But there must be limits to what He can do . <p> I know this is so because I still exist . I plucked you when you were ripe , and I 'm doing my best to harvest this latest crop from under His Nose . If It exists , if he exists . So what if he has trapped me here and makes me slither on my belly and shed my skin and eat toads ? These are very weak plays , in my opinion . Not worthy of a being who is truly supreme . <p> So I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the little village of West Lawn . She has brought her baby to the orchard with her . It 's asleep in a basket in the shade , swaddled in a koala blanket . A cute little thing with silver down and a hook nose . I start **30;1867;TOOLONG with a joke . <p> This guy 's car breaks down in the desert , twenty miles from the nearest town , and as he 's walking through the heat of the day , he prays to God for help . <p> God hears him and says , " Because you believe in Me , I will grant you whatever you wish . " <p> The man says , " Well , I could really use a new car . How about a Silver Porsche Boxster with the 2.7 liter engine ? " <p> This pisses God off . " Such a materialistic wish ! Think again and ask for something that will bring peace to your immortal soul and give honor and glory to Me . " <p> The man is ashamed . He looks deep into his heart and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why I 've been stranded here in this desert . I 've been married and divorced six times and now I 've lost everything except twenty-seven dollars and a crummy ' 89 Ford Escort . My wives all complained that I never met their emotional needs , that I was selfish and insensitive . What I wish is to understand women . I want to be able to read their feelings , anticipate their thoughts , satisfy their every desire . I want to make some woman truly happy . " <p> There is a long silence . Then God says , " So , you want the standard or the automatic ! " <p> " That 's funny . " **30;1899;TOOLONG smiles as she leans her ladder against the next tree . The orchard is filled with the tart fragrance of ripe persimmon . " I 'm glad we have no men here . " <p> " Men are trouble , " I agree . <p> She climbs two rungs then pauses , as if distracted . <p> " What ? " I say . <p> " The angels say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gardener . " <p> " They would . " I 'm both pleased and annoyed to have drawn them out . " What does the Gardener say ? " <p> She sniffs and continues up the ladder . " The Gardener does n't talk to me . " <p> " The Gardener does n't talk to anyone . That 's the best part of the joke . " I wrap myself around the trunk of the tree and start climbing after her . " How do you even know there is a Gardener ? " <p> " The angels tell me . " <p> " You see angels ? " <p> She plucks a fruit the color of hot coals off the branch . " Not exactly see . " <p> I 've had this conversation with many of the other innocents . I 'm almost tempted to say her lines for her , get to the crunch . <p> " You see them now ? " I say . " How many ? " <p> She shows me three fingers . <p> " They like to travel in packs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " <p> She crooks her left arm around the ladder 's rail and reaches with her right . " They do n't speak in words . " The dried calyx of the persimmon looks like a hat , the fruit like a blank red face . <p> " They show you things ? " <p> She nods . The tip of her tongue pokes between her flat teeth . <p> " Like in a dream ? " I crawl onto the branch she is working . <p> " Just like . " She twists another persimmon free . <p> " But not as real as a bite of ripe fruit . Or the square , scaly bark of this tree . Or the cry of your baby . " <p> She glances down . " My baby 's not crying . " <p> " Do you know what the angels are going to do to them ? Really ? " <p> The down on her neck ruffles . She says nothing . <p> " The book says that the Sun will turn black as sackcloth of hair , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're wicked , " she says . <p> " They are , " I agree . And then I hit her with another joke : Revelation , Chapter 14 . <p> And another angel came out of the temple , crying with a loud voice to him that sat on the cloud , Thrust in thy sickle , and reap : for the time is come for thee to reap ; for the harvest of the Earth is ripe . And the angel thrust in his sickle into the Earth , and gathered the vine of the Earth , and cast it into the great winepress of the wrath of God . And the winepress was trodden without the city , and blood came out of the winepress ... <p> " Stop , " she says . Her voice is like a hammer striking a stone . <p> " All right . " The innocents have spilled the blood of all the animals , giraffes and moose and baboons and anteaters and voles , but they have never killed one another . And although they despise your works , they recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sun and dream under the stars . As they do . When they use the imagination the Gardener gave them , His plan to exterminate you makes them very , very queasy . " Besides , it 'll probably never happen . " <p> " Why do you say that ? " <p> Below us , the baby is stirring . It makes moist sounds , like mud sucking at a sandal . <p> " Well , it just does n't seem fair to you . " As I let her mull that over , my tongue flicks out . I ca n't help it - that 's the way we serpents smell . We sample the air with our forked tongues and then thrust the two tips into the vomeronasal recesses organs in our palates . **30;1931;TOOLONG smells of stale sheets and night sweat ; she 's one of the ones who has already begun to think . " I mean , after the angels kill them all , the Gardener will expect you to leave the garden and go into the world . Take their place . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to do that ? " <p> Her jaw muscles work but she says nothing . <p> " What are the angels telling you now ? " I ask . <p> She blinks ; I think she would cry if she could . " That I must have faith . " <p> " Ah , faith . " So the seed is sown . Take heart , my children . I may yet bring in this new harvest . <p> IMG
