Lyming , Scotland February 1847 The ferryman was dead . There was no doubt about it . The fellow had no pulse . His skin was like ice . His pupils were dilated , his eyes glassy and staring . Reilly Stanton did n't need a medical license to tell him that this man was no longer among the living . But Reilly was n't the one who needed convincing . It was the wizened fisherman stooped over beside him who seemed to be suffering from some doubts . " What 's ailing him , then ? " the old man asked , his breath turning instantly to steam in the cold winter air . " Aye . " The fisherman 's question was echoed by several of his peers , all of whom had come to stare down at the corpse , as well as at Reilly , who 'd had the ill judgment to plunge into the frigid water after the drowning man . " I 'm afraid , " Reilly said , lifting his dripping head from the dead man 's equally sodden chest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The eldest of the fishermen blinked down at him . " What do you mean , gone ? " " Well , passed on . " Seeing the blank expressions on the faces around him , Reilly tried again . " Expired . " The word expired had always worked well enough on the families of Reilly 's patients back in Mayfair . It was clear , however , that delicacy was wasted on these particular fellows , and so Reilly said , enunciating with difficulty through teeth that were beginning to chatter with the cold , " I 'm afraid your friend is dead . " " Dead ? " The old man exchanged incredulous glances with his companions . " Stuben 's dead ? " Reilly rose to his knees no small feat , since his once fine breeches were stiff with frozen saltwater and looked longingly toward the alehouse . At least , it looked like an alehouse . It was the structure nearest the pier where they now stood , and through the fog Reilly could see that there was a sign swinging above the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An alehouse , a whorehouse , Reilly did n't care what it was , so long as he was soon in it , drying off and warming up before a fire , preferably with a glass of whisky in his hand . But first , of course , there was the dead ferryman to be seen to . " But that canna be , " the toothless fisherman insisted . " Stuben canna be dead . He 's never died before . " " Well , that 's the nature of death , is n't it ? " Reilly managed a sympathetic smile . " We tend to do it just the once . " " No ' Stuben . " Around the corpse , shaggy gray heads nodded emphatically . " He 's gone under many a time , has Stuben , and he 's no ' died before now . " " Well . " Reilly tried to picture some of his more learned peers Pearson , for instance , with his ubiquitous cigar , or Shelley , with that ridiculous silver-handled cane he did n't need standing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this motley group , and failed . Well , Pearson and Shelley had too much sense to have signed on for such an assignment . Too much sense , and nothing like Reilly 's blue-eyed , golden-haired impetus . He said , " Well , gentlemen , I 'm afraid he did n't make it this time . I 'm very sorry for your loss . But he was clearly intoxicated " This was , of course , the grossest of understatements . The ferryman had been so blind drunk Reilly had almost asked if there was n't some other boat he could hire for the trip across the water . But he 'd stopped himself at the last minute . What was the worst , he 'd wondered , that could come of a drunk ferryman ? That the boat might run aground , or worse , sink ? So he 'd drown in the frigid and tumultuous waters off the coast of the Scottish Highlands . So what ? It was n't as if he had anything much to live for , anyway . Christine , back in London @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live with the knowledge that Reilly Stanton had died in an effort to win her love ... Of course , when the stupid man had lost his footing and slipped into the sea just as they were docking , Reilly had n't given a thought to his own safety , much less to what Miss Christine King was going to think . He had plunged without hesitation into the icy water and pulled the old man , dead weight though he 'd been , back to shore . It was only now , standing there soaking wet , shivering like a dog , that it occurred to Reilly he 'd missed yet another wonderful opportunity to make Christine sorry for what she 'd done . He 'd come so close to a romantic death ! He could almost hear the ladies back in Mayfair : " Darling , did you hear ? Young Dr. Stanton the eighth Marquis of Stillworth , do n't you know died in the wilds of the Hebrides , trying to save another man 's life . I ca n't imagine what that heartless Christine King was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must have been out of her head . Such a self-sacrificing , noble gentleman ... handsome , too , from what I hear . Poor girl is beside herself with grief . " Well , he had certainly botched it . And because the old duffer had up and died on him despite his best efforts , Reilly could n't even write home and mention , ever so casually , about how he 'd managed to save a life his very first day on the job , damn it all . When was his luck going to change ? " I 'm sorry about Mr. Stuben , " Reilly said , to the ferryman 's friends , " but he was well past feeling anything when he went , if it 's any consolation . He was quite intoxicated . Now if you good gentlemen do n't mind , I 'm quite cold and wet through , and I 'd like to get out of this wind " " That 's the thing . " Several hoary heads wagged . " Get ' im out of this wind . Someone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a toothless gent assured them . " Sent the boy for ' er , soon as I seed Stuben go under . " " Good lad . " The eldest fisherman sighed . " Well , I 'll take his head , you take his feet . Ready ? Ayuh . " Reilly stood , the bitter wind throwing salt spray all around him , as gnarled hands seized the body of the ferryman and lifted it . Then the solemn-faced processional moved with maddening slowness toward the nearest structure , the one Reilly had been hoping so fervently was an alehouse . Left alone on the dock , Reilly glanced around . Buffeted by the wind and waves , the ferryboat thudded dully against the side of the pier . His bags and trunk were still aboard it , but as he 'd been the only passenger , that was all , save the ferryman 's empty bottles , which rolled noisily back and forth across the deck . Other than the dead ferryman 's friends and a plethora of vociferous seagulls swooping about overhead , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting him , communication with the mainland being what it was , but he 'd thought there might at least be someone to take his bags ... Well , never mind . There 'd been a death , after all . He supposed the bags would be safe enough for now . Wrapping his cloak about him though the ice-encrusted material did little to shield his body from the wind he caught up to the dead man and his entourage . They were headed toward the only building he could see through the fog , that building in which there promised , from the lights in the windows , to be a fire if nothing else . Reilly fell into step beside the fishermen , and when one complained of weariness , he took a turn at holding the dead man 's head . Then another of the old men , clutching his chest , stepped aside , and Reilly found himself holding not only the dead man 's head , but his upper torso , as well . Then a third fisherman bowed out , coughing with alarming , body-wracking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferryman over his back and was bearing the full of his weight , while Stuben 's friends shouted encouragement and approval at him . Thank God , Reilly thought grimly to himself , there was no way this was going to get back to Christine . Romantic as she might have thought his death , there was n't anything the least romantic about this particular situation . He staggered toward the alehouse clearly an alehouse , he could see now , though the name of it on the wind-battered sign The Tortured Hare was not very encouraging . But as soon as the door was yanked open , Reilly was bathed in a wave of beer-scented heat , and he was relieved to find that whatever else it might have been , The Tortured Hare was at the very least warm , dry , and still serving . And full of people . At the announcement of one of his new companions " Stuben 's gone in the drink again , and this ' un fished him out " there was a collective murmur of excitement , followed by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the way of the women who darted forward to place an enormous plank across several benches someone had set near the hearth . " Put him down here , " commanded a large , middle-aged woman in a fairly unsullied apron and cap . " Right there , on the table . " Reilly complied , though " table " was not the word he would have chosen to describe the makeshift structure onto which he lowered the cold , lifeless body . No sooner had the man once known as Stuben met the hard planks , than the woman was hurrying to undo his sodden clothes , barking orders at everyone within earshot as she did so . " Flora , fetch a bottle of whisky . Blankets from the upstairs cupboard , Maeve . There 's a pan of water over the fire in the back kitchen , Nancy . Fetch it , and find some rags . Has anyone gone for Miss Brenna ? " " Sent the boy for ' er , " one of the fishermen assured her . " Good , " the woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Reilly wondered , was this Miss Brenna ? A peculiarly ugly name in Reilly 's opinion , an opinion shared by his friends Pearson and Shelley , who 'd unanimously declared Brenna the most hideous name for a female in the English language , with the possible exception of Megan . It was , they 'd decided , almost guaranteed that any woman christened with the name Brenna would be cursed with multiple chins , overly large front teeth , and a distinctly horse-like countenance . And during the course of their admittedly not very scientific investigation into the veracity of their theory , they had yet to be proved wrong . The ferryman 's clothes were peeled off until he lay there , quite naked , under the gaze of everyone who happened to be in The Tortured Hare which included , Reilly saw , the alehouse 's staff , all of whom were women and some of whom looked astonishingly young . Even more astonishing , these young ladies did not seem the least bit shocked at the sight of the corpse or its state of undress . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being swaddled in hot rags , dropped from a pot of steaming water held in the girl Nancy 's hands , none of those hardened Highland lassies gave the cadaver a second glance . " Um , " Reilly felt compelled to say , when his teeth had ceased chattering enough to allow speech , by which time the dead man very nearly had been covered from head to toe in hot cloths . The woman clearly the proprietress of the place spared him a single glance . Then she snapped , " Maeve , dunna stand there like a ninny . Get the gentleman out of those wet clothes and under a blanket . " Reilly looked with alarm at the very determined young lady coming toward him . He took a hasty step backward and raising both hands exclaimed , " Um , no , no . That 's not I mean , I 'm fine . Really . I just think someone ought to tell you , madam , that that man there is " But Reilly , whose only previous visits to Scotland had been for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or no contact with the natives , was ill prepared to defend himself against the single-minded purposefulness of a typical Gaelic maid . In a thrice , Mistress Maeve had hold of his cloak and then his coat , and was wrenching them both from him in a manner that caused him to suspect her well used to undressing reluctant customers ... and to what purpose he had only too certain an idea . Short of resorting to fisticuffs , Reilly saw no way of deterring Maeve from her goal , which seemed to be stripping him as naked as the corpse that lay before them ... at least until he found himself standing on the far side of the room , literally backed into a corner , his waistcoat and shirt gone now , as well as his coat and cloak , while a very determined set of fingers worked at the fastenings to his breeches ... " That , " Reilly said , seizing the wrists just above those fingers , " will be quite enough , I think . " Maeve blinked up at him , her expression @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking abashed , the girl 's mien was distinctly kittenish . " She said I was to get ye out of yer wet things , " the maid reminded him . " Yes , " Reilly said . " Well , I 'd like to keep my trousers just now , if it 's all the same to you . " " I do n't think ye ought to , " Maeve said . " Like to come down with the quinsy , if you do . " " Or the rheumatics , " called another female voice . It was only then that Reilly noticed young Nancy , the girl who 'd been dispatched to fetch hot water for the ferryman , had returned , and was watching them both with rapt attention . " Right , " Maeve said , staunchly . " Or the rheumatics . You would n't want to be coming down with the rheumatics " Maeve 's gaze roved over his naked chest . " Not a fine young man like yerself . " Reilly , perfectly convinced now that he 'd stumbled into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that brought her to her feet . He then pried her fingers from his waistband , thus preserving what was left of his dignity . " I will , " he said , resolutely steering Maeve away from him , " risk it . " Now clad only in a pair of soaked breeches and equally sodden boots , Reilly saw that his fears of being unmanned before the entire village had been ill-founded : no one with the exception of Maeve and Nancy was paying the slightest attention to him . The patrons of The Tortured Hare seemed to find the contents of their ale tankards more interesting than the half naked man in the corner , and a good deal more fascinating than the fully naked one stretched out upon the table in the center of the room . All except for the tavern 's proprietress , that is , who was calling to the ferryman , " Wake up . Wake up now , Stuben . " Reilly , oddly touched by the woman 's tenacious refusal to admit the obvious , said gently , " Madam , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truth of the matter is , Mr. Stuben is dead . " The woman froze , a hot cloth , which she 'd been about to drop over the ferryman 's nether regions , steaming in her hands . She eyed Reilly very astonishedly indeed . " Dead ? " she echoed . The word appeared to have a riveting effect on the tavern 's patrons . Suddenly , all heads swiveled in Reilly 's direction . " Er ... yes . " Now that he 'd managed , at last , to attract the attention of nearly every person in the room , Reilly became acutely aware of his near nakedness . The blanket that had been suggested earlier seemed a long time coming . Nevertheless , he had a duty to perform , and perform it he would . " Yes , madam , " he went on . " Dead . He has no pulse , nor has he taken a breath since I pulled him from the water . I hate to tell you this , but I fear your efforts , though valiant , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the patrons of The Tortured Hare suddenly seemed a good deal more interested in the man on the plank now that it appeared he was not alive . In fact , some of them were straining their necks to get a better look at him . A dead ferryman , Reilly supposed , was eminently more worthy of attention than a live one . " Dead ? " The woman looked down at the cadaverous visage below her . " Stuben ? But he 's never died afore . " Reilly raised an eyebrow . " Yes , " he said , wondering if everyone in the place was daft , and if so what he as the village 's only physician was going to be expected to do about it . " Well , this time , I 'm afraid his plunge was fatal . I 'm very sorry to be the bearer of bad news . I did everything I humanly could for him , but I 'm afraid the water was just so cold , and he is as you can see rather advanced in years . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's level of intoxication at his time of death . There were ladies present , after all . " He just was n't strong enough to make it this time , " Reilly said . " Now , if it would n't trouble you too much , I wonder if you could send someone down to the ferry for my things . I 'd like to change " He was interrupted by the violent banging of the front door as it flew open to reveal a tall figure , swathed in a heavy dark cloak , the ends of which whipped smartly in the bitter wind . " Oh , Miss Brenna ! " The proprietress of The Tortured Hare looked immensely relieved . " Thank God you 're here . " Reilly looked with interest upon the figure in the doorway . So this was the Miss Brenna everybody kept talking about ! Well , she certainly did n't disappoint . She was tall enough to be a Brenna , surely . Only a few inches shorter than he was , by God , and he stood just over six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the deep hood her face , so he could n't quite see if the rest of her fit her name , but she certainly looked an Amazon . Pearson and Shelley would be right pleased to hear it . " Stuben 's gone into the drink again , " one of the fishermen informed her . " And that one said he 's dead . " " Who ? " The voice was precisely the sort he 'd expect from a Brenna , deep in pitch and not at all feminine . Reilly was congratulating himself on being an excellent judge of womankind when a gloved hand parted the folds of the cloak , swept back the hood ... ... and very nearly caused him an apoplexy . Because there was no double chin here , nothing in that countenance that could be construed as the least bit reminiscent of a horse , except perhaps the wild mane of copper-colored curls which tumbled , perfectly unrestrained by net or comb , from the top of her head . In fact , this particular Brenna was all that was comely and fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the fact that beneath her cloak the girl was wearing ... a second glance proved it ... a pair of men 's trousers . Yes , men 's trousers , which clung suggestively to her slim thighs , and were tightly cinched about the waist with a thick leather belt , into which had been tucked the ends of a bulky green sweater . On the girl 's feet Reilly observed a pair of sturdy leather boots . The sweater and the boots hid some key attributes , but the trousers were magnificent . Reilly had never seen a woman in trousers before . Christine , he was quite certain , would sooner have paraded in a potato sack than anything remotely resembling pants . Still , it was a fashion innovation that , though it might not have reached Paris or London as yet , Reilly felt he could whole-heartedly support . In truth , he felt quite overwhelmed by its impact , enough so that it was a moment or two before he became aware that the girl was speaking again . " Who said Stuben was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now seemed so at odds with her extremely feminine appearance . A dozen fingers pointed in Reilly 's direction , and a second later he found himself pinned under the gaze of a pair of eyes that were not only the bluest , but also quite positively the shrewdest , he 'd ever seen . He had no hat to snatch from his head at the sight of her Maeve had appropriated that , as well as his coat and cloak and so could only bow a little at the waist , morbidly conscious of his state of near nakedness . " I did , " he said , inexplicably unnerved by the brightness of her gaze . " I said it . I pulled him from the water myself . He had no pulse . He was ice cold " " Who , " she asked , blinking once , " are you ? " He noticed that Miss Brenna , unlike everyone else whom he 'd encountered since crossing the border , did not possess a Scottish burr but spoke as God and the Queen intended , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . " Reilly Stanton . I 'm the one who accepted the position " She had already looked away from him , and was striding toward the corpse . " you all advertised . " Reilly watched as she wrenched the dead man to his side , then moved behind him . " The physician 's position . I 'm here to begin my appointment . " Noting that no one looked very comprehending , he added quickly , " I 'm licensed , of course , by the Royal College of Physicians . I 'm a Fellow of the College , as well Oxford , actually and I studied in Paris ... I say , perhaps you did n't hear me , but that gentleman is really quite " To his utter disbelief , the girl plowed her fist with enough force to cause a hollow thudding sound , which surely would have smarted if the fellow had n't already been dead into the center of the corpse 's back , exactly between his shoulder blades . " dead , " Reilly said . " I 'm terribly sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at that moment that the ferryman opened his mouth and spewed a fountain of rum and seawater onto the floor , splashing the boots of everyone around him , including Reilly . Blinking groggily , the previously dead ferryman managed a sheepish smile . " Sorry ' bout that , " he said .
