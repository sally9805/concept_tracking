The Prophet of Yonwood By Jeanne Duprau Random House Jeanne Duprau The Vision On a warm July afternoon in the town of Yonwood , North Carolina , a woman named Althea Tower went out to her backyard to fill the bird feeder . She opened her sack of sunflower seeds , lifted the bird feeder 's lid -- and that was when , without warning , the vision assailed her . It was like a waking dream . The trees and grass and birds faded away , and in their place she saw blinding flashes of light so searingly bright she staggered backward , dropped her sack of birdseed , and fell to the ground . Billows of fire rose around her , and a hot wind roared . She felt herself flung high into the sky , and from there she looked down on a dreadful scene . The whole earth boiled with flames and black smoke . The noise was terrible -- a howling and crashing and crackling -- and finally , when the firestorm subsided , there came a silence that was more terrible still . When the vision finally faded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground , unable to move , with her mind all jumbled and birds pecking at the spilled birdseed around her . She might have lain there for hours if Mrs. Brenda Beeson had not happened to come by a few minutes later to bring her a basket of strawberries . Seeing Althea on the ground , Mrs. Beeson rushed forward . She bent over her friend and spoke to her , but Althea only moaned . So Mrs. Beesonused her cell phone to call for help . Within minutes , four of her best friends -- the doctor , the police chief , the town mayor , and the minister of the church -- had all arrived . The doctor squatted beside Althea and spoke slowly and loudly . " Can you tell us what 's wrong ? " he said . " What is it ? " Althea shivered . Her lips twisted as she tried to speak . Everyone leaned in to hear . " It 's God , " she whispered . " God . I saw ... I saw ... " She trailed off . " Merciful heavens , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Of course they did n't know at first what her vision had been . They thought maybe she 'd seen God . But why would that frighten her so ? Why would she be muttering about fire and smoke and disaster ? Days went by , and Althea did n't get better . She lay on her bed hardly moving , staring into the air and mumbling . Then , exactly a week later , a clue to the mystery came . The president of the United States announced that talks with the Phalanx Nations had reached a crisis . Their leaders would not give in on any of their demands , and the leaders of the United States would not give in on theirs . Unless some sort of agreement could be reached , the president said , it might be necessary to go to war . Brenda Beeson made the connection right away : War ! That must be what Althea Tower had seen . Mrs. Beeson called her friends , they told their friends , the newspaper wrote it up , and soon the whole town knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was terrible . All over Yonwood , people gathered in frightened clusters to talk . Could it be true ? The more they thought about it , the more it seemed it could be . Althea had always been a quiet , sensible person , not the sort to make things up . And these were strange times , what with conflicts and terrorists and talk of the end of the world -- just the kind of times when visions and miracles were likely to happen . Brenda Beeson formed a committee to take care of Althea and pay attention to anything else she might say . People wrote letters to the newspaper about her and left flowers and ribbons and handwritten notes in front of her house . The minister spoke of her in church . After a few weeks , nearly everyone was calling her the Prophet .

" My new home , " said Nickie . " You have to get that notion out of your mind , " said Crystal . " It 's not going to happen . " I 'm going to make it happen , thought Nickie , though she did n't say it out loud . Crystal 's mood was already bad enough . " How long till we get there ? " she asked . " We 'll be there in twenty minutes , if nothing else gets in our way . " A lot had gotten in their way so far . The Streakline train was closed down because of the Crisis , so they 'd had to drive . They 'd been on the road for seven hours , though the trip from Philadelphia should have taken no more than five . But long lines at gas stations , detours around pot-holed or snow-covered stretches of highway , and military roadblocks had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was a fast-moving , efficient person , and when her way was blocked , she became very tense and spoke with her lips in two hard lines . They came to the Yonwood exit , and Crystal turned off the highway onto a road that wound uphill . Here the trees grew thick on either side , and so tall that their bare branches met overhead , making a canopy of sticks . Drops of rain began to spatter the car 's windshield . After a while , they came to a sign that said , " Yonwood . Pop . 2,460 . " The trees thinned out , and the rain fell harder . They passed a few storage sheds , a collapsing barn , and a lumberyard . After that , houses began to appear on the side of the road -- small , tired-looking wooden houses , their roofs dripping . Many of them had rockers or couches on the front porch , where people would no doubt be sitting if it were n't the dead of winter .

He had on a rain jacket with the hood up , and rain dripped off the hood and onto his nose . " Hello , ma'am , " he said . " Are you a resident ? " " No , " said Crystal . " Is that a problem ? " " Just doing a routine entry check , ma'am , " the man said . " Part of our safety program . Had some evidence lately of possible terrorist activity in the woods . Your purpose here ? " " My grandfather has died , " Crystal said . " My sister and I have inherited his house . I 've come to fix the house up and sell it . " The man glanced at Nickie . " This is your sister ?

" He smiled . " You be careful while you 're here , now . We 've had reports indicating there may be agents of the Phalanx Nations traveling alone or in small groups in parts of the area . Have you been spoken to by any suspicious strangers ? " " No , " said Crystal . " Just you . You seem very suspicious . " " Ha ha , " said the man , not really laughing . " All right , ma'am , " he went on . " You may go . Sorry for the delay , but as you know there 's a crisis . We 're taking every precaution . " He stepped away , and they drove on . " Terrorists even here ? " Nickie said . " It 's nonsense , " said Crystal . " Why would a terrorist be wandering around in the woods ? Pay no attention . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
