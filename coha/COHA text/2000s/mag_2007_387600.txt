. No time to coddle your child ? Try the less-is-more parenting style Hooray for the nuclear family . You 'll get no argument from me that kids who grow up with both parents in the house are more likely to get along on the playground , learn the proper way to use a fork , make the cheerleading squad , and get into Yale . But life as a suddenly single father has afforded me another insight : All that nuclear parenting is awfully inefficient . When I was a nervous new dad ( and still married ) , oblivious to the irreconcilable differences forming like thunderheads over my baby 's crib , I spent my time taking care of my firstborn as unwisely as any inexperienced parent . My wife and I 'd both trek to the store , infant in tow , and huddle in the Enfamil aisle reading labels and obsessing over nutritional fine print . We 'd drop everything to change the baby together , as if this were a project requiring careful orchestration . When we split in 2000 and lost the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like facing parental bankruptcy : I kicked into survival mode , and every bit of extraneous activity had to go because I now saw my kids only on weekends and had a lot to accomplish in that limited window . At that point , I had to wring all the inefficiency out of my routine . And my kids took on a lot more responsibility in the process . Once Jessica , 9 , and Robert , 7 , were old enough to have opinions about their clothes , for instance , I told them they were responsible for getting themselves dressed . ( So what if we left the house every now and then with mismatched socks and inside-out shirts ? ) When their motor skills advanced to the point where they could rub soap onto a washcloth , I 'd stand them in the shower with strict instructions to come out clean . Sometimes they actually did . It was their job to make their own beds , too . Daddy was too busy figuring out how to remove juice stains from shirts . They revolted , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Children are more clever than that . When Jessica puts on her pajamas , she 's learned to fling her clothes behind the bed instead of just dropping them on the floor , an act certain to elicit a lecture on being responsible for your own stuff . And Robert somehow comes up with the most engaging existential questions every time I tell him to clean his room : Are you still going to be our daddy after Mommy gets married again ? My response : Well , sit right down , Son , and let 's chat about that . Never mind about your room . Still , I count certain victories . You want me to cut the crust off your grilled cheese ? Here 's a butter knife . Try to leave a little cheese this time . My kids can open the garage door on their own ( there 's no electric opener ) , and even though I 'm not always sure what they do in there , it usually buys me a few precious minutes of quiet while they sort through the abandoned treasures sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say no once ! They 'll still come up with 389 other outlandish requests , but it feels like progress compared to most married parents . What 's really remarkable , though , is watching some of my fellow parents squander their energy trying to meet their kids ' relentless demands , possibly because they know the other parent will step in when they burn out . Which means they remove the seeds from watermelon and spend 20 minutes searching for otherwise meaningless ( but highly treasured ) toys at bedtime . This I simply do n't have the time or energy to do ( and if I gave each of my kids a Hershey bar , they 'd agree ) . When I visited one of my favorite families recently , the mom asked if my kids preferred whole milk , low-fat , or skim . Whatever you have , I said . As long as I 'm not pouring them milk of magnesia , I consider that a success . And other parents are so much fussier than I am about child safety that it earns me a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her third-grader for playdates at other kids ' houses , away from her supervision . Fine  --  playdate 's at your house , then ! I 'll come by in a few hours , after I 've gotten some conference calls out of the way . In the end , my children have probably suffered some degradation of self-esteem from this lack of pampering that will surface when they start to date or go on job interviews . Yet I console myself by recalling those family stories from the old days , when my grandfather had to hunt wild turkeys as a young boy during the Depression and my own parents drank bourbon , smoked unfiltered cigarettes , and cavorted during house parties while the kids ran around unsupervised in the yard , next to the new interstate . Then again , who knows ? Maybe one of my kids will be the next Abe Lincoln , I daydream , a mold breaker propelled by my insistence on self-sufficiency . Maybe someday I 'll be lauded as a brilliant father , cajoling my kids to strive and succeed before they even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go clean the burning egg off the stove before my children force an evacuation of the entire neighborhood .
