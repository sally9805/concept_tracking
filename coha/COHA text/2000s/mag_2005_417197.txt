In fact , the slate can last well past the life of the building , making it extremely recyclable . // Builders have always said " a good hat and good shoes " are essential to protect a house from any type of weather . Even so , home builders opt to install the cheapest , shortest-lived shingles on four out of five new homes built in the United States today . " ' First cost ' is the overriding issue in most home building , " says Alex Wilson , executive editor of BuildingGreen , publishers of Environmental Building News and Green Building Products . " Builders are trying to get the most house for the least money . And most homeowners have bought into the idea that they should build or buy the largest house they can afford . Doing so means they cut corners on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials into your home makes much more sense when you take a long-term view of home building and its life cycle costs . Only then is it apparent that building with better roofing materials is in your best interest . And now , eco-friendlier roofs are more attractive , affordable , durable and readily available than ever . CRITERIA TO CONSIDER Not all roofing material is created equal . Each has attributes that best suit certain structures and environments . Choosing the right product for your home involves a careful analysis of such factors as durability , solar reflectivity , cost and ecological impact . If you have considered re-roofing your home or are planning to build a new house , weigh these criteria before selecting a roof material . First , consider the roof 's durability : How long will it last ? Some asphalt shingles are inexpensive to buy , but they have half ( or less ) the life expectancy of many other roofing materials . But higherquality asphalt shingles can be a viable option if properly chosen , says Clarice Snell in his book , The Good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Poor quality asphalt shingles ... are the Styrofoam cup of the building industry , but high-quality asphalt shingles are much cheaper than metal , easy for one person to install , accommodate roof punctures such as chimneys and skylights with relative ease , and can last 30 to 40 years or more . " The moral here is that even the same product type can have a wide range of quality , so be sure you know what you 're getting before you buy .

On Page 83 : Slate roofs are perhaps the most durable of all roofing materials . In fact , the slate can last well past the life of the building , making it extremely recyclable . Photograph Left : Clay-tile roofs are often considered green for their ability to be removed , reused and installed on other buildings . Additionally , clay has a high resistance to wind and fire , and is low maintenance . Right : " Living roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , improve local air quality , mediate urban heat-island effects and reduce storm-water runoff . // Another consideration when choosing a new roof is the material 's solar reflectivity , known as the albedo . If you are planning to retrofit an older home with a greener roof , its albedo may be a greater concern than a newer house with efficient insulation . Use of lighter colored , low solar-absorbent roofing surfaces is one of the key measures advocated in the " Cooling Our Communities " program of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) . Studies conducted by the Florida Solar Energy Center compared the performance of roofing materials . Asphalt shingles had a solar reflectance ranging from 3 percent ( onyx black shingles ) to 31 percent ( " white " shingles ) . Brown wood shingles were found to have a solar reflectance of about 22 percent , and a brownish-orange terra-cotta cement tile had about a 24-percent solar reflectance . In contrast , white and light-colored metal roofing had reflectances ranging from 50 percent to 66 percent . Improving the albedo of your roofing surface @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depending on how much insulation is in your ceiling or roof . And , while you save on cooling costs , you 'll also prolong the life of your shingles . According to www.energystar.gov , roofs with high solar reflectivity maintain a more even core temperature , which protects against the shingles ' deterioration . " Cooling-load avoidance can be important in some situations , " Wilson says . " But if a house is properly insulated to at least R-24 the higher the R-value , the lower the heat flow in the ceiling or roof , the heat gain or heat loss through solar energy absorption on the roof surface is really pretty minor . With the insulation levels recommended in a green home , albedo is not a significant consideration . " ASPHALT OPTIONS According to the Asphalt Roofing Manufacturers Association , more than 12.5 billion square feet of asphalt shingle products are made each year - enough to cover more than 5 million homes annually . The attraction to asphalt shingles is they are affordable and lightweight - no additional engineering is needed to put them on your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually are the least expensive upfront , but proportionately less durable over time . " It 's a hard sell to push homeowners to longer-lasting alternatives because those alternatives are usually a lot more expensive , and the homeowner probably does n't expect to stay in a house for more than 20 years , " Wilson says . " Asphalt is a bad roofing option from an environmental standpoint , " Wilson adds . " In addition to all the resources going into making such a short-lived product , there is a tremendous amount of solid waste generated from the removal of old shingles . " Every year about 11 million tons of asphalt shingles are shucked into landfills , according to www.shinglerecyding.org . In fact , old asphalt shingles constitute about 3 percent of all municipal solid waste . Asphalt shingles can be recycled , but so far the technology to do so is in its infancy , and widespread asphalt shingle recycling is not available . Asphalt shingles come in two different kinds : organic-based or fiberglass-based . The organic kind are made from materials such as recycled waste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a specially formulated asphalt coating and surfaced with weather-resistant mineral granules . Organic-based asphalt shingles contain about 40 percent more asphalt per square ( 100 square feet ) than fiberglass , which gives them more weight , durability and blow-off resistance . Fiberglass shingles start with a glass-fiber reinforcing mat that is coated with asphalt and mineral fillers for adhesion , then embedded with ceramic granules . Asphalt shingles come in many different shapes , sizes , thicknesses and grades . If you do choose to use asphalt , make sure to pick the most durable shingle that suits your structure 's needs , usually an organic variety . CLAY-TILE ROOFS Made from abundant raw materials , ceramic-tile roofs are one of the longest-lasting roofing materials available . " Fifty years is nothing for a tile roof , " says roofing restoration expert Joseph Jenkins of Barkeyville , Pa . " Fifty years is a young tile roof . " In fact , tile roofs can easily last for more than 100 years , often outlasting the buildings they protect . Because of this , they often are considered " recyclable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on other buildings . Clay tile also is coveted for its high resistance to wind and fire , low maintenance and ease of repair . Disadvantages include its heavy weight and its high initial cost . Tile roofs can easily cost two to three times more than an asphalt shingle roof , but the initial expense will pay off in many years of hassle-free roofing . OUT OF THE WOODS Generally split from Western red cedar , Alaskan yellow cedar and Eastern white cedar logs , wooden shingles are available in a variety of shapes and sizes . They have an estimated life of 25 to 30 years in dry climates , and 10 to 15 years in moist climates . Wooden shingles allow the roof to " breathe " and release water vapor , provided they are laid over a subsurface that allows for air circulation behind the shingle . // Green Roofing Materials Comparison // While the rustic beauty of wooden shingles is obvious , they do have their drawbacks . " I am not a fan of wooden shingles , " Wilson says . " The raw materials @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fairly short , particularly in wet climates . " Moist climates will promote mold , rot , mildew and fungus growth , and arid climates will result in warping and cracking over time . The initial cost also can be high - twice as much or more as asphalt shingles . Wooden shingles may not be suitable for use in fire-prone areas . Check with your local building code official first . According to the Center for Resourceful Building Technology , the wooden shingles predominantly found on the market are from old-growth forests . For homesteaders with the ability and the resources , hewing your own wooden shingles from already fallen local timber is a viable alternative . ( See " Make Your Own Shingles , " Page 81 . ) STEP UP TO SLATE Slate stone roofs are perhaps the most durable of all roofing materials . They also are strong , available in a color spectrum from sea green to earthy red , and are quite beautiful . Tiles can be made in almost any shape , and they can be installed on roofs in a variety of thicknesses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7 pounds per square foot , which may require additional structural support for your home or building . The minimum slope for a slate roof is a ratio of 4:12 , Jenkins says , but the best use for slate roofing is for steep slopes . Like clay tile , slate also can last long past the life of the building - making it extremely recyclable - and it is initially more expensive than many other roofing materials , but less expensive when comparing the long-term cost over a roof 's life . Slate can last almost indefinitely , depending on the type , thickness , fasteners , roof slope and installation , with only minor maintenance . With the right tools and a little know-how , installing or repairing a slate roof is fairly straightforward . Reclaimed slate also is available . ( See " Roofing Resources , " Page 88 . ) " By recycling a slate roof yourself , you can own a lifetime stone roof for less money than the cheapest of asphalt roofs , " Jenkins says . " If you 're not that industrious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yourself with the proper guidebook and tools . " Professional slate-shingle installation also is widely available . UNDER THE EARTH Living roofs , covered with a dense mat of growing plants , are sprouting up on the tops of commercial and residential buildings in the United States as a way to reduce heating and cooling costs , and to improve local air quality . Urban heat-island effects ( the tendency for large asphalt and concrete areas - such as in cities - to build up more heat than the surrounding countryside ) also are reduced , as is storm-water runoff . Living roofs can detain more than 50 percent of rainwater from a typical storm , which reduces the loads placed on storm sewers in urban areas , according to Green Building Products . Also referred to as a " green roof , " a living rooftop usually consists of a water-proof membrane , such as a modified asphalt or synthetic rubber ( EPDM ) , over the roof sheathing . Next , a root barrier and drainage media are placed . On top of the drainage media , 2 to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , organics , clay and silt ) are laid . This soil structure supports drought-tolerant plants such as succulents , herbs , forbes , grasses and some low groundcovers . Due to their weight and need for solid structural engineering , living roofs are better suited to new construction , rather than retrofits , although a structural engineer can help you determine the feasibility of your existing building structure for supporting a living roof . Water will add another 10 to 25 pounds per square foot when the living roof is saturated , so this roofing method should n't be taken lightly . Weight requirements ( including snow , where applicable ) need careful consideration when a suitable roofing structure is designed for holding up all that earth . Living roofs are now available from a handful of suppliers for either commercial or residential application . The Green Products Directory lists U.S.-based companies that specialize in this area . ( See " Roofing Resources " at left . ) One of the problems with living roofs is what to do if they ever spring a leak . Tracing the leak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frustration , and solving the problem may require some professional consultation and careful excavation . GRASS ROOTS ROOFS Thatch roofs , made with the dry , coarse stems of reeds or gram crops , have been commonplace wherever these materials exist for thousands of years . A common misconception is that thatch absorbs large amounts of water . In fact , in a thatch roofing system water is transferred down the roof from stem to stem until it drops . The steep pitch usually ( at a ratio of 12:12 ) associated with thatch roofs allows for water to be shed at a very fast rate , according to the Building Conservation Directory ( www.buildmg conservation.com ) , a Web site dedicated to the conservation of historic buildings . Besides being water-resistant , thatch roofs are wind-resistant . And , because of the thousands of air pockets between and within the plant material , thatch also is a good insulator , providing a R-value of about 40 . Fire can be a concern , however , and thatcher Colin McGhee of Staunton , Va. , says that to comply with fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with an odorless , nontoxic fire retardant . " But thatch , as it 's used in roofing applications , is inherently very fire resistant , " McGhee says . Thatch reed roofs are long-lasting , with life spans estimated between 50 and 100 years , if constructed and maintained properly , McGhee says . " Every 12 years or so , thatch roofs need a brushing and dressing off , and the ornamental ridge replaced . I 've worked on thatch ! roofs in England that are more than 1OO years old and still going strong . " But at a considerable price per installed square foot , most of us do n't have deep enough pockets to roof our houses with thatch . If you 're entranced with thatch , consider tackling a smaller project such as a garden shed or gazebo . For do-it-yourselfers , McGhee sells inexpensive , " shaggy " thatch mats at less than $5 per square foot . ( See " Roofing Resources , " Page 88 . ) RECYCLED ROOFS The rise in popularity of green building has produced a large variety of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate tile made from recycled plastic and waste-wood composite . Known as polymer-composite or synthetic roofing , these products have die advantage of being lighter dian clay tile or slate . Their inherent flexibility makes them resistant to hail damage , high winds and even occasional foot traffic . Made primarily of synthetic materials , they also resist organisms that promote decay . Most polymer roofing materials carry 40- or 50-year warranties , but also carry a high initial cost , often about $3 per square foot . Panelshake roofing panels , molded from a mixture of old milk jugs and wastewood fibers , mimic the look of natural slate and tile roofs . Another composite roofing product , Enviroshake , combines reclaimed materials such as recycled plastic , agricultural flax- and hemp-fiber waste and a little bit of postconsumer recycled tire rubber . Touted as an alternative to traditional cedar shakes , Enviroshakes incorporate UV protection with excellent mold- , mildew- and insectresistant properties . Once installed , they are almost maintenance-free . By using 60-percent to 70-percent recycled tire rubber , Euroslate moves rubber from the road to your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offer a similar look to slate . Photograph These thin-film photovoltaic panels are bonded directly onto the metal roof . // Although polymer-composite roofing offers some environmental benefits up front , no infrastructure exists currently to support the reclamation and recycling of these materials at the end of their useful lives . Robert FaIk , Ph.D. , one of the original designers of the product , says he eventually would like to see a buyback system put in place to promote the return of used composite building materials to companies for re-manufacture . Fiber-cement shingles , made by blending Pordand cement with finely ground sawdust ( from recycled sources ) , sand and clay , are another composite product . Known for their durability in warmer climates , they typically carry a 50-year warranty . Unfortunately , fiber-cement shingles absorb water , which may weaken the shingle due to freeze-thaw cycling in cold weather . Some products , however , have coatings or polymer constituents to minimize water absorption . METAL ROOFS Metal roofing can be made with up to 25-percent recycled steel from scrapped automobiles . This form of roofing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slate or clay tiles . Additionally , metal will not rot or crack , is noncombustible and designed to resist hurricaneforce winds . Metal roofing also reflects more radiant sunlight than it absorbs , which saves you money on heating and cooling , and it comes in a wide spectrum of matetials : steel , stainless steel , aluminum , copper and zinc alloys . Each has different properties that affect durability , price and appearance . Prices range from about $1.80 to $6 a square foot , which may seem expensive , but its long life , minimal maintenance and reduced installation labor makes it proportionately affordable over the long tun . Its lightweight and durable , with a life expectancy of 20 to 50 years , and you can sheet right over an existing toof with it . Metal roofing does have a few drawbacks . Some types of metal roofing such as aluminum make more noise during rain or a hailstorm and can dent . Long-term issues include paint finishes that can peel , chip , fade or scratch . PHOTOVOLTAIC ROOFS The last word in eco-friendlier roofs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shingles and thin-film laminates that both serve as a protective roof cover and energy powerhouse . When the sun strikes the solar cells embedded in the their matrix , electricity is produced . These types of shingles may even produce power on partly cloudy days . According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory , solar shingles provide the same durability , flexibility and protection as asphalt shingles . Most are warranted to produce power for at least 20 years . United Solar Ovonic 's Uni-Solar shingles incorporate directly onto the roofing surface and usually integrate well with conventional asphalt shingles . The company estimates that replacing a 450-square-foot section of conventional shingles with solar shingles can meet a third of a typical household 's annual electricity needs . Adantis Energy Systems SunSlate PV tiles can be incorporated with tile , shake , metal or asphalt-composite roofs . Joe Schwanz , CEO of Home Power magazine , says one drawback to solar shingles can be the myriad connections and roof penetrations that the shingles necessitate . And the dark color and high absorbance of solar shingles can actually add to a home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insulating the home from the shingles , such as with a radiant barrier . ) United Solar offers a simpler and less costly option with its PV laminates that are bonded directly onto metal roofing . The photovoltaic sections are larger with fewer connections and roof-penetrating drill holes . These panels range in size from 4A ( 31 watts ) to 18 ( 136 watts ) feet , with wiring either in the ridge cap or the eave soffit . On average , about 180 square feet of roof area with good solar access generates 1 kilowatt of electricity . Go to www.uni-solar.com for more information . The biggest hurdle for installing PV-shingle or tile systems is their high initial cost . Uni-Solar Model SHR-17 solar roofing shingles , for instance , cost about $135 for every 7-by-l-foot section , not including installation , power inverter , batteries , mounting , fuses and wiring . You 're not only buying a roof , however , you 're also buying energy-producing solar panels . Additionally , a growing number of states now offer tax and rebate incentives of up to 50 percent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of investing in this renewable energy technology . ( To find out if you are eligible for any incentive or rebate programs in your area , search the Database of State Energy Incentives at www.asireusa.org . ) Factor this in with the reduced or even nonexistent electricity bills you 'll encounter each year , plus the satisfaction of producing pollution-free electricity , and solar roofing becomes a far more viable roofing option .

The best designs have continuous soffit and ridge vents to remove any moisture that might get into the ceiling or attic insulation . But if these vents are not feasible , solar-powered attic fans can be a reasonable alternative . During summer months , attics in many homes trap heat , putting an extra burden on your cooling system . In the wintertime , poorly ventilated attics can sequester warm , moist air that rises from a home 's heated interior . As moisture condenses and collects on various surfaces , wood rot , stained ceilings and peeling paint can result . If moisture infiltrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cellulose or fiberglass .

Some models can even be installed at the site of an existing attic vent , eliminating extra roof penetrations . Because most are low-profile , they integrate almost seamlessly onto your rooftop .
