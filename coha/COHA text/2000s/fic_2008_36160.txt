Massachusetts , December 1690 <p> THE DISTANCE BY wagon from Billerica to neighboring Andover is but nine miles . For myself it was more than a journey away from the only home I had ever known . It was the ending of a passage from the dark fog of infancy to the sharp remembrances of childhood . I was nine years of age on that December day and my entire family was going back to live with my grandmother in the house where my mother was born . We were six in all , cramped together in an open wagon , carrying within my mother and father , two of my older brothers , myself , and Hannah , who was but a baby . We had with us all of our house hold possessions . And we were bringing , unbeknownst to any of us , the smallpox . <p> A plague of it had swept across the settlements of Middlesex County , and with our crossing east over Blanchard 's Plain , contagion and death followed with us . A close neighbor , John Dunkin of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , leaving a widow and seven children . Another neighbor brought us the news , and before the door could close on the messenger , my mother had started packing . We had thought to outrun the pox this time . My father had bitter memories of being blamed for bringing the pox into Billerica many years before . He always said it was because he was a Welshman and a stranger to the town , even after living there for so many years , that he stood accused . But the disease crept along with us like a pariah dog . It was my older brother Andrew who would be the first to succumb . He carried the seeds of sickness within him , and from him it would spread to our new town of residence . <p> It was deep into the season and so bitterly cold , the liquid from our streaming eyes and noses froze onto our cheeks like frosted ribbons of lace . All of us had dressed in every bit of clothing that we possessed and we pressed tightly together for warmth . The crudely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and my brothers and I had wrapped it around us as best we could . The draft horse labored under his load , for he was not a young gelding , and his breath steamed in great puffs into the air . His coat was as woolly as any bear 's and encrusted with a forest of icicles that hung down sharply from his belly . Richard , my oldest brother , was not with us . He was near a man at sixteen and had been sent ahead to help ready the house for our arrival , bringing provisions strapped across the back of our one remaining ox . <p> Father and Mother sat at the front of the wagon silent , as was their habit . They rarely spoke to each other in our presence and only then of weights and measures and time delineated by the seasons . The language of field and home . He often deferred to her , which seemed remarkable , as he towered over my mother . Indeed , he towered over everyone . He was close to seven feet tall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a small child , his head seemed to rest in the clouds , his face forever in shadow . He was forty-eight years of age when he married my mother , so I had always thought of him as an old man , even though he carried himself erect and was fleet of foot . Thomas Carrier , so the gossip went , had come from old England as a young man to escape some troubles there . As my father never spoke of his life before marrying , and for truth said hardly a word regarding anything at all , I did not know his history before he plied his trade as farmer in Billerica . <p> I knew only two things for certain of his past . The first was that my father had been a soldier during the civil wars of the old England . He had a red coat , old and battered and faded to rust , which he had brought with him from London . One arm was torn , as though slashed through with something sharp , and Richard had told me that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have lost an arm for sure . When I pressed Richard for more of the story as to how and where Father had fought , my brother would purse his lips and say , " Ah , but you 're only a girl and can not know the ways of men . " The other thing I knew was that men feared him . Often behind my father 's back they would gesture secretly to one another a peculiar signal . A thumb passed over the neck from one side to the other as if to sever their heads from their bodies . But if Father ever saw these gestures , he gave them no notice . <p> My mother , who was Martha Allen before marrying , sat next to him , holding Hannah , only one year old . She was wrapped into a shapeless bundle and held loosely like a package . I remember watching my little sister with the cruel fascination of a child , wondering when she would topple out of the wagon . We had lost a baby sister , Jane , years before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear that this baby would die as well . The first year was so fragile that some families did not name their child until the child was past twelve months and more likely to live . And in many house holds if a baby died , that same baby 's name would be passed on to the next born . And to the very next if that babe died as well . <p> At times I suspected my mother had no tender feelings for any of us , even though we were as different from one another as children could be . Richard was very much like Father : tall , silent , and as impenetrable as the rocks in Boston Bay . Andrew , the next oldest , had been a sweet child and cheerfully willing to work , but as he grew , he stayed rather slow in thought and often my mother lost patience with him . Tom , the third son , was closest to me in years and closest to my heart . He was quick and bright , his humors running hot and restless like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ labored breathing and so , at the times of seasons ' changing , had not much strength to work in the field or barn . I was next in age , stubborn and willful , I was often enough told , and thus not easily loved . I approached the world with suspicion , and because I was not pretty or pliable , I was not doted upon . I often challenged my betters and was therefore often chastised vigorously with a slotted spoon we children had named Iron Bessie . <p> It was my manner to openly stare at the people around me , despite knowing how this discomforted them , especially my mother . It was as though my staring robbed her of some essential part of herself , some part that she held in reserve even from those closest to her . There was hardly a time when we were not eating or sleeping or working together , and so we were expected to give quarter in this regard . She loathed my staring so greatly that she would work to catch me at it , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she would use Iron Bessie on my back and legs until her wrist gave out . And as her wrists were as strong as any man 's , this took some time . But in this way , I came to witness so much that others did not see . Or did not wish to see . <p> It was not defiance only that made me study her so , although our cat-and-mouse games did become a kind of battle . It was also because she , with a deliberation bordering on the unseemly , set herself apart from what a woman should be and was as surprising as a flood or a brush fire . She had a will , and a demeanor , as forceful as a church deacon 's . The passage of time , and layer upon layer of misfortune , had only worked to stiffen the fabric of her being . At first glance , one might perceive a comely woman of some intelligence , not young , but neither yet old . And her face , when not animated by speech or untempered passions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep pond , the surface of which was placid enough but deeply cold to the touch and which was filled beneath the surface with sharp rocks and treacherous choke roots . And she had a tongue , the sharpness of which would gut a man as quick as a Gloucester fisherman could clean a lamprey eel . I know I was not alone in my family , or amongst our neighbors , in fervently praying for a beating rather than having to endure the lacerations of her speech . <p> As our wagon moved slowly past fields covered in deep drifts of encrusted snow , I looked expectantly about for farm houses or , better still , the sight of a garrison outpost or a gallows hill with the remains of ropes still dangling from broad-limbed oaks where the hangman had cut down the bodies . We speculated about how long the bodies would be left on the rope before public decency required them to be removed . In years to come children of a tender age would be kept away from the hangings , flailings , and public tortures of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet in my innocence and thought such necessary instructions to be no more unpleasant than wringing the head from a chicken 's neck . I had , from time to time , seen men and women in the stocks , and it had been great sport for my brothers and me to throw bits of refuse at their captive heads . <p> Crossing over the Shawshin River bridge , we entered the Boston Way Road , which would lead us north to Andover . We passed the houses of our new neighbors , the Osgoods , the Ballards , and the Chandlers , all to the west of us . And there , just ahead to the east , was the town 's southern garrison . The garrison was a stout two-storied house with provisions and ammunition kept on the second floor . The stockades were of great necessity , as there were still violent Indian raids in the surrounds . Only the year before had there been a deadly raid on Dover . Twenty-three were killed . Twenty-nine children were captured to be kept or traded back to their families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were frosted , the man posted on the lookout did not see us and so he did not raise his hand to us as we passed by . <p> Just north of the garrison , set off from the main road , was my grandmother 's house . It was smaller than I had remembered and more homely , with a steeply pitched roof and an iron-cladded door . But when the door opened and Richard came to greet us , I remembered well the old woman who followed him out . It had been two years or more since our last visit . Her bones did not like to travel to Billerica by cart , she had said . And she told my mother she would not imperil her daughter 's immortal soul by having us travel to Andover until my parents had started going to the meeting house on each and every Sabbath . We could be captured and killed by Indians on the way , or waylaid by path robbers , or fall into a sinkhole and drown , she had said . And then would our souls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were testament in equal parts to my mother 's obstinacy and her great dislike for sitting in a pew . <p> The old lady lifted Hannah at once from my mother and welcomed us into a house warmed by a great fire and the smell of a cooking pot , reminding us that we had eaten only a few hard biscuits at dawn . I walked through the house , sucking my stinging fingers , looking at the things my grandfather had made . He had died some years before I was born and so I had never met him , though I had heard Richard say he was so alike my mother that bringing them together was like throwing oil onto a burning brand . The house had one common room with a hearth , a table hand-rubbed and smelling of beeswax , butter , and ashes , a few rush chairs , and one fine carved sidepiece for storing plates . I ran my fingers lightly over the designs , wondering at the cunning workmanship . Our house in Billerica had only benches and a rude trestle table with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Andover house had one small bedchamber off the main room and a stairway that led up to a garret room filled with a lifetime of crates and jars and wooden trunks . <p> My parents , with Hannah , were given Grandmother 's room and bed , while she took a cot next to the hearth in the common room . Andrew , Tom , and I would sleep in the garret , while Richard would have to make his rest with the ox and the horse in the barn close behind the house . He could stand the cold better than most , and Mother said it was because his inner heat was not diminished by an open mouth and a loose tongue . He was handed most of the blankets , as he would have no way of making a useful fire in the hay . Grandmother found for the rest of us a few old relics of batting for our covers against the freezing air . <p> The first night , the house was filled with the sounds of the walls settling against the layering snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was used to sleeping in an alcove with Hannah at my chest as a warming stone . I lay on my pallet shivering in the cold , and when I closed my eyes I could yet feel the movement of the wagon . The straw worked its way out of the ticking and pricked the skin on my back , making me restless . There was no candle to light our room , and I could not see where my brothers lay sleeping only a few feet away . At long last a shaft of moonlight worked its way in between the boards at the window , and the long-necked jars made shadows of headless ghost-soldiers on the rough timbers , marching as though in battle with the moon shafts traveling across the walls . I threw off the batting and crawled across the splintered planks , feeling along with my hands until I reached my brothers ' pallet and crawled in close to Tom . I was too old to be sleeping with my brothers and would be punished in the morning if caught , but I pressed myself close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ warmth , closed my eyes . <p> WHEN I WOKE in the morning I was alone , my brothers risen , the objects scattered about the room looking gray and much used . I dressed quickly in the aching cold , my fingers as unbending as sausages . I crept down the stairs and heard the sound of Father 's voice vibrating through the common room . The smell of cooking meat made my belly cramp but I crouched low on the stairs so I could see while not being seen , and listened . I heard him say " ... it is a matter of conscience . And let us leave it at that . " <p> Grandmother paused for a moment and , laying her hand on his shoulder , replied , " Thomas , I know of your differences with the parson . But this is not Billerica . It is Andover . And the Reverend Barnard will not brook absence from prayer . You must go today in good faith to the selectmen , before the Sabbath , and give your oath of fidelity to the town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabbath , you must come with me to the meetinghouse for service . If you do not , you may be turned out . There is much conflict with newcomers laying claim to land . There are jealousies and resentments here enough to fill a well . If you stay long enough , you will see . " <p> He looked into the fire , struggling to resolve the conflict within - between compliance to the laws of the meeting house and the desire to be left entirely to his own devices . I was very young but even I knew he was not greatly liked in Billerica . He was too solitary , too imposing in his unyielding beliefs in what was fair and what was not . And there was always whispered gossip of a past life , supposedly unlawful but never precisely named , that created a space for solitude . Last year Father had been fined 20 pence for arguing with a neighbor over property lines . His size , his great strength , and his reputation caused the neighbor to give way in the dispute , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them despite the fine . <p> " Wo n't you do this for your wife and children ? " she asked gently . <p> Bowing his head to his breakfast , he said , " For you and for my children I will do as you ask . As for my wife , you must ask her yourself . She has a great dislike for the Minister Barnard and coming from me it would be taken very badly . " <p> FOR ALL GRANDMOTHER was soft and gentle , she was also persuasive , and like water wearing down rock she worked on Mother until she agreed to attend services on the morrow . Mother said under her breath , " I 'd rather eat stones . " But she brought out her good linen collar to be washed nonetheless . Richard and Andrew would leave with Father that very morning for the north end of Andover . They would put their mark on the town register and pledge faith to defend it from all attackers , promising to pay tithes in good time to its ministers . I pinched Andrew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would repeat everything he would see and hear . Tom and I were to be left behind with Mother for the cooking and gathering of firewood . Grandmother said that a respectful visit should also be made to the Reverend Francis Dane , who lived directly across from the meeting house . He had been pastor in North Andover for over forty years and was greatly loved . He was to have given way in his ministry years ago to the Reverend Barnard but , like a good shepherd , he sensed there was enough wolf in the younger man to warrant his continued protecting presence . The two men grudgingly shared the pulpit , and their sermonizing , every other week or so . I stood at the door and watched the cart 's progress as far as the bend in the road , until they were swallowed behind mountainous drifts of snow . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
