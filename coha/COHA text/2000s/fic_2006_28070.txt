Chapter One It was the feel of her presence in my room that woke me - again . I rolled over in bed and squinted at the clock on my nightstand . " What time is it ? " My voice slurred . The blurry numbers came into focus . Two thirty-three . " Two thirty-three ? Do n't you ever sleep ? " She did n't respond . I scooted my pillow against the headboard to sit up , see what she was doing . " What is that ? " I asked . " Like it ? " She shimmied in front of the mirror . The layered fringe on the dress she was wearing swayed in waves . " It 's an old flapper dress I found at Goodwill , " she said . In her stockinged feet , she performed a little Charleston for me . " It 's vintage . Totally retro . Do n't you think ? I 'm wearing this baby to prom . " I snorted . Her eyes met mine in the mirror and sobered me fast . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she hooked her long hair over her ears and wiggled her hips again . She 'd chosen the blonde wig tonight . It was n't her favorite , since she thought it made her look cheap . Like a slut . It did go well with the red dress , though . She caught me looking at her and smiled . " I 'm going to run for prom queen , too . " I burst into laughter , then clapped a hand over my mouth to smother the sound . Would n't want to wake the parental units upstairs . She wasn'tlaughing . She was joking . Was n't she ? " Lia - " " Luna , " she said . " I 've taken the name Luna . " Her eyes fixed on mine . To gauge my reaction , I guess . Or seek my approval .

A spray of luminescent beams . " Luna , " she repeated softly , more to herself than me . " Appropriate , would n't you say ? A girl who can only be seen by moonlight ? " Exhaustion overwhelmed me suddenly . Or my weariness of it all . " Go to bed , Luna . " I snuggled down into my comforter and punched my pillow , willing myself back to sleep . It 'd take me hours to drift off again , especially if she stayed to do her makeup . And she would . I studied her through a slit eye . Something was different . A change had come over her . Nothing physical . More a shift in her cosmos - or maybe a crack . " I can see your bra straps , " I told her . " You need to buy a strapless . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over her shoulder . " Do you have one ? " " Get real . Even if I did , you 're not wearing my underwear . " " It would n't fit anyway . I 'm at least a C cup . " I blew out a puff of air . " You wish . " Rolling over , I muttered , " You 're such a freakshow . " Her hair splayed across my pillow , tickling my face . " I know , " she murmured in my ear . " But you love me , do n't you ? " Her lips grazed my cheek . I swatted her away . As I heard her slog across the floor toward my desk - where she 'd unveiled her makeup caddy in all its glory - a sigh of resignation escaped my lips . Yeah , I loved her . I could n't help it .
