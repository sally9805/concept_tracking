<p> There will be nothing gentle about Kevin Bookout 's collegiate debut tonight , when he will become the first freshman to start the season opener during Kelvin Sampson 's nine years as Oklahoma 's coach . <p> The crowd at New York 's Madison Square Garden for No. 3 Oklahoma 's game vs . No. 8 Alabama in the AT &T; Wireless Coaches vs . Cancer Classic will be nearly eight times the 2,500 population of Bookout 's hometown of Stroud , Okla . It 's part of a nationally televised doubleheader that opens the major college basketball season . <p> Opportunities such as Bookout 's , and the demands that accompany them , have been developing more frequently in recent seasons as more elite-level players have made early departures to the NBA . Last season Virginia Military Institute 's Jason Conley averaged 29.3 points a game to become the first freshman to lead the nation in scoring and Texas ' T.J. Ford averaged 8.27 assists to become the first freshman to lead the nation in that category . <p> Ford led the Longhorns to the NCAA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1997  --  the latest example of how first-year players can lift or sustain top teams in power leagues . <p> Bookout 's career will begin tonight with a similar challenge . He steps into a lineup otherwise filled by players who had major roles in Oklahoma 's run to last season 's Final Four . And Alabama 's big men include two notable seniors : 6-8 Erwin Dudley , last season 's Southeastern Conference player of the year , and 6-9 Kenny Walker , who 's expected to have an accolade-filled season . <p> " I graduated from high school with just 55 people , " Bookout says . " I 'm just a big old Oklahoma boy . " <p> Actually , there 's a lot more to the 6-8 , 260-pound Bookout 's athletic resume . <p> In track , he holds the national high school records for the shot put and discus and looms as a solid Olympic prospect for 2008 and 2012 . <p> In baseball , his fastball was clocked at 93 mph and he set the state 's high school career home run record ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out there , " says Sampson of watching Bookout play baseball . " He was hitting against a crafty little left-hander who had a sneaky fastball . Kevin hit it into the next county . " <p> And in basketball , Bookout averaged 30.6 points and a state-leading 16.2 rebounds while leading Stroud ( 28-3 ) to a state championship last season . He also was 380-for-451 from the floor , a remarkable .843 shooting percentage . <p> Mention that statistic , and Bookout responds with an embarrassed laugh and says , " Most of the competition I 'd play against would n't be real tall . " <p> Sampson says that when he saw it , " I thought that was a misprint . " <p> Ready to get physical <p> Even so , Sampson knows he 's asking plenty as he slides Bookout into the power forward position where bruising Aaron McGhee averaged 21.8 points in five NCAA tourney games last spring . <p> So , on a team that thrives on being one of the nation 's most physical , can Bookout fit in as a freshman ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , " Sampson says . " I think that remains to be seen . That 's why playing against such a great team the first night out will be good for Kevin . " <p> Says Bookout : " This is the type of program I wanted to be in . I like to get down low and bang . " <p> Sampson traditionally has avoided rushing even the most talented freshmen into the starting lineup because " freshmen are usually mistake-prone . Because of how fast everything is , you have to be patient with them because they tend to repeat the same mistakes . But Kevin Bookout rarely makes the same mistake twice . " <p> That may have something to do with the 4.0 grade-point average that made him one of Stroud High 's valedictorians . <p> Still , Sampson is n't expecting Bookout to instantly match McGhee 's production . " I do n't think Kevin will replace Aaron right away , " Sampson says . " Down the road , I think Kevin will be a better player , but I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that " this kid kills the myth of the big , slow , white guy . Kevin is n't a fast runner , but he has quick feet . " <p> Oklahoma is hoping those quick feet will keep yielding the moves that opened Bookout for the short shots he never seemed to miss in high school . They are largely the product of his shot put and discus work , where the throwing momentum begins with a deft spin that 's dependent on solid footwork . <p> " His skills in basketball , his ability to jump and catch and throw , are very similar to what a good discus thrower needs to do , " says Ed Wade , the Oklahoma track coach for weight events . " The training they do for basketball is very similar to what he would be doing for track , aside from all the running . " <p> Wade , a former NCAA indoor champion in the shot , says Bookout 's future in track , where he is the only U.S. prep athlete to be ranked No. 1 nationally three years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is as bright as he wants to make it . " <p> " If you look at list of the best throwers in the world , he 's got all the physical attributes and dimensions of those people , " says Wade , who expects Bookout , 19 , to peak in track at 28 or older . <p> " There have been guys on that list who were multisport athletes like Kevin , like ( 1984 Olympic shot put silver medalist ) Michael Carter , who was a great football player . It can be done . " <p> Family mantel under strain <p> Bookout is the third son in his family to star in the shot and discus . <p> Oldest brother Casey won Oklahoma high school titles in the shot and discus three times each , then set the University of Oklahoma record for home runs . He signed with the Cincinnati Reds and made minor league all-star teams but retired because of back trouble . <p> Kyle , who as an Oklahoma senior will be his brother 's track teammate , won three state high school titles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swept those titles four consecutive years , giving the family 19 state championships . <p> That family tradition began because their father , Dennis , an elementary school principal , was friends with a physics teacher , Eldo Roddy , who had a passion for studying the shot and discus . Dennis learned from Roddy , then built throwing rings behind their house in a field that belonged to a neighbor . <p> As for how Kevin did n't end up playing Oklahoma 's favorite sport , football , Dennis Bookout says , " He played through his freshman year , and he had some ability , but it 's his least favorite sport . He just did not enjoy it . He got a concussion and said he was n't going to be involved in it . " <p> Kevin Bookout also has given up baseball so he can focus strictly on track after the basketball season ends . <p> While watching Bookout easily win last spring 's state championships , Sampson was struck by how intense Bookout stayed throughout his events . <p> " He has an inner competitiveness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He has a fear about performing less than he 's capable of . I do n't know if it makes sense , but he has a positive insecurity about himself . " <p> Says Bookout 's father , " He 's got the mentality of a walk-on athlete , that I have to prove myself . " <p> And doing that starts tonight . <p> CORRECTION-DATE : November 19 , 2002 , Tuesday <p> CORRECTION : A Nov. 14 story incorrectly characterized Kevin Bookout 's records in the shot put and discus . He holds the Oklahoma state high school records , not national ones .
