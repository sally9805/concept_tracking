<p> With promoters sometimes spending hundreds of thousands of dollars just to advertise a single concert or music event , it 's worth noting what Superfly Productions paid to market its first Bonnaroo Music Festival in 2002 . <p> Nothing . <p> Organizers were prepping for a massive ad buy to promote the brand-new jam-band-centric festival , which would take over 600 acres of farmland in Manchester , Tenn. , 60 miles southeast of Nashville . <p> But they stalled upon noticing that tickets were already selling better than they had expected . And these were n't your ordinary Ticketmaster-variety tickets , either . These buys came straight off Superfly 's website , sans a Ticketmaster fee and generated by 100 percent Internet-generated hype . <p> In the course of three weeks , during which more than 70,000 tickets were sold , Bonnaroo helped legitimize the jam-band scene in the mainstream 's eyes and became the most envied live-music model in the entire U.S. concert industry . <p> A year later , Bonnaroo 2003 sold all its 80,000-plus tickets in less than two weeks using the same methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ announce the lineup and on-sale date for Bonnaroo 2004 , which will descend on Manchester June 11-13 . <p> ' We knew it was going to be successful , just not as successful as it was , ' said Superfly 's Rick Farman of that first year . ' We would have been satisfied selling 40,000 or 50,000 , or less than that even . But instead we sold 70,000 tickets with no advertising - all through our website . We planned to use Ticketmaster , but we never got the chance to . ' <p> A few months ago at the Aspen Artist Development Conference , music industry leaders - including Farman - debated the music world 's woes against the scenic backdrop of Aspen Mountain . They gave kudos where they were due , but amid such tumultuous times , the bad outnumbered the good . <p> The good buzz included 50 Cent , iTunes , Hillary Duff and Bonnaroo - a fact that puts the Southern festival in a fortunate but curious light . <p> Whereas the world at large is all too familiar with 50 Cent 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's vibrant mug , their Bonnaroo knowledge resembles the festival 's advertising budget . <p> Nothing . <p> ' It 's one of the largest festivals in the country , and it 's totally under the radar , ' said Al Schnier , vocalist , guitarist and keyboardist for the New York jam band moe. , which has played Bonnaroo 's first two years and is negotiating for a possible third appearance . ' ( The festival ) certainly helped to put this scene on the map , or at least it acted as a huge road sign . <p> ' It really should be some sort of sign to the music industry that there is a huge scene like this , despite the fact that it 's more or less underground , that exists and thrives on its own completely ignoring the mainstream , ' he said . <p> And why should n't it ignore the mainstream when the mainstream ignores it ? <p> Jeff Raines , the guitarist for the New Orleans-based jam/funk band Galactic , was more than surprised to walk into the media tent at the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> ' Bonnaroo took to the mainstream media like nothing had before , ' Raines said . <p> It does n't help that many people reading this article are unfamiliar with moe. or Galactic . Both play Denver 's 3,600-capacity Fillmore Auditorium on Feb. 13-14 . And they are an integral part of the jam-band scene created by the Grateful Dead and nurtured since by Phish , Widespread Panic and many others . <p> ' Most people have n't heard about moe. or Galactic , which is unusual considering that both of them have very solid followings and have been around for a while , ' said Casey Richardson , a Bonnaroo vet and a publicist with the Denver-based promotion and distribution company INDIEgo . ' But there 's a lot of music that goes unnoticed in the mainstream , and you have to be the kind of person who will seek it out on your own . ' <p> Mike McGuirk has made a living out of tracking down obscure music while researching his book ' The Music Festival Guide : For Music Lovers and Musicians , ' which hits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no jam-band fan but admires their open-mindedness . <p> ' The jam-rock folks , say what you want , but they 're certainly always looking for something new , ' McGuirk said . <p> Exposing jam-band fans to new music is an essential part of Bonnaroo , according to Superfly 's Farman . It 's why his company books acts like Neil Young , the Flaming Lips and Jurassic 5 into the mix with the String Cheese Incident , Widespread Panic and Galactic . <p> ' All the genres seem to be included , ' said Galactic 's Raines . ' They do a lot of eclectic acts . Norah Jones was there , and so were the great bluegrass bands . The DJs provided an interesting mix . ' <p> The festival 's enormous stature - both in fans and bands - is what separates Bonnaroo from other U.S. festivals , according to the String Cheese Incident 's Billy Nershi . <p> ' None of the big record label bands are there or the radio-hit bands - it was all bands that had built up their fan bases by touring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ String Cheese Incident , which played the first Bonnaroo . ' Although all the bands were very different from each other , that was the thing they had in common . They did n't get their fans by radio hits or <p> record label pushes . <p> It was by hard work out on the road . ' <p> And in the course of putting on a good show , the festival brought the scene to the forefront for many . <p> ' The impact of this music on the ( industry ) really manifested itself in Bonnaroo , ' said Ray Waddell , a Nashville-based senior writer for Billboard magazine . ' ( The festival ) legitimized this movement because these jam bands and their popularity have gone under the radar , even though Widespread Panic , Gov't Mule , Phish and Dave Matthews have been going out and doing strong business over the years . ' <p> Promoting jam-band music has n't ever been a walk in the park for the Boulder-based Madison House Publicity , which handles the String Cheese Incident , Keller Williams , the Steve Kimock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long press and radio and the industry at large have ignored this growing group of fans that buy multiple tickets to multiple shows and multiple albums , ' said Carrie Lombardi , a publicist with Madison House . ' It 's an easy community to ignore from a mainstream perspective , because , quite frankly , they do n't know what to do with them . <p> ' Jam bands are n't as sexy as the media need its artists to be . They 're musicians not performers , ' she said . ' They do n't want to be told to lose weight or cut their hair . They wo n't want to be molded into the next Britney Spears . ' <p> But who needs the media when you have Internet-savvy fans and fanatically detail-oriented websites that keep the masses more than informed ? <p> ' There 's a real coconut telegraph among these fans , ' said Billboard 's Waddell . ' And there 's half your battle won already , because they 're doing a lot of the legwork for you . It all goes back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schwartz works out of Boulder with veterans ( Widespread Panic ) and rookies ( Rosehill Drive ) , but what he 's most impressed about is how Bonnaroo sells its tickets . <p> ' It sells out very quickly , and it 's all through word of mouth , ' said Schwartz , who hit the first Bonnaroo because he was handling Panic 's books at the time . <p> Madison House 's Lombardi does n't see the Bonnaroo business model applying to any other music genre because jam-band fans are so unusually supportive , interconnected via the Internet and willing to travel . <p> And travel they must , when it comes to Bonnaroo . <p> Manchester is n't exactly a metropolis and because of limited infrastructure and hordes of people , a drive that typically takes a couple hours turns into a 12-hour journey . The String Cheese Incident 's Nershi , with whom Lombardi works closely , remembered his 10-hour , stop-and-go trek into the farmlands . <p> ' We were lucky enough to be in a tour bus , and we were just jumping out walking down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Everybody was just hanging out partying . We 'd find some people to hang out with , and then 15 minutes later , the bus would come by and we 'd get in . ' <p> Festivalgoers now come prepared for the trek by nominating a designated driver and packing mad amounts of alcoholic and sometimes hallucinogenic supplies . <p> " Down South people know how to party , " Nershi said . " That 's one of the main objectives , to blow it out a little bit . "
