<p> It 's up there in big letters on the departures board at Los Angeles International Airport , but still I have trouble believing it : a regularly scheduled , nonstop flight to Havana . Not only am I holding a round-trip ticket , I 've also got an official Cuban visa , a bulging wad of American dollars I can legally spend there and a letter from the U.S. Department of the Treasury reminding me how many Cuban cigars I can bring home . <p> A fantasy of the day , somewhere in the hazy future , when the United States finally ends its 40-year ban on travel to Cuba ? No . This really happened recently . I traveled to Cuba with the full blessing of the Bush administration . <p> You can , too . It 's much easier than you 've been led to believe . <p> The catch is that you 'll probably have to go on a tour . Under a program begun by the Clinton administration and continued by President Bush , at least a dozen American companies have been issued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Cuba . <p> So far , the U.S. Treasury Department 's Office of Foreign Assets Control , which grants the licenses and enforces the Cuban travel ban , has taken a liberal view of what " people to people " means . They have authorized Cuban jazz tours , hiking tours , salsa-dancing tours , **28;8722;TOOLONG tours , architectural tours , steam-railroad tours - even baseball tours . <p> One firm , San Francisco 's Global Exchange , legally sent more than 2,000 Americans to Cuba last year on 60 different programs focusing on everything from Afro-Cuban religions to sustainable development . <p> The tour I took in November , operated by Cross-Cultural Solutions of New Rochelle , N.Y. , was probably more in line with what the Clinton administration had in mind when it approved " people to people " programs . We spent a good portion of our week visiting community medical clinics and meeting with such groups as the Cuban Women Federation and the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution . Frankly , the itinerary sounded earnest and dull , but the trip turned out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies must re-apply for licenses every year , and among the firms I talked to there is concern that some previous license holders might be denied this year . Treasury spokesman Robert Nichols said he did n't know how many tour companies got licenses last year - he said they 're lumped in with other categories among the 19,000 licenses given out - but guessed that the number would remain about the same this year . Before you book a tour , though , it 's important to ensure that the firm has a current , valid license from the U.S. Department of Treasury . ( There are other legal ways besides tours to go to Cuba . See " If you go . " ) <p> I signed up for a tour because I wanted to go now , before the United States ends its travel-and-trade embargo and the island is transformed faster than you can say " Hard Rock Cafe Havana . " The embargo has been a dam holding back globalization , and when it 's lifted , U.S. corporations are going to wash over Cuba like a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legally in 2000 , the most recent year for which the Treasury Department has figures . A large number of those were Cuban Americans , who are permitted one visit a year under current regulations . No one knows how many Americans visited illegally , passing through Mexico or Canada . Estimates range from 25,000 to more than 100,000 . <p> Technically , it is not illegal to travel to Cuba , only to spend money there . But since all visitors leaving Cuba must pay a $20 departure fee - in U.S. dollars - the point is moot . What is certain is that traveling to Cuba in violation of the Trading With the Enemy Act is getting riskier . ( See sidebar . ) <p> So strong is the taboo that , even holding all the proper papers and an airline ticket , I could n't help feeling like a 19-year-old sneaking into a bar with a fake ID . <p> The 4 1/2-hour flight I took from Los Angeles to Havana is operated by TACA , a well-run Salvadoran airline , and is technically a charter . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy U.S. government regulations . Except for the fact that I could book it only through a travel agency specializing in Cuban travel - which also obtained my visa for me - it 's a normal flight operating once a week . <p> Our flight was nearly two hours late leaving the gate because a large team of agents from the U.S. Transportation Security Administration subjected passengers to the most thorough search I 've encountered in 25 years of travel . They opened and inspected everything in our luggage , even unscrewing the caps of toothpaste tubes . This seemed excessive until I remembered that anti-Castro terrorists blew up a plane from Barbados to Havana in 1976 , killing everyone aboard . One of the alleged masterminds , Cuban exile Orlando Bosch , lives openly in Miami . <p> At Havana 's Jose Marti International Airport - a drab , Soviet-style building , but spotlessly clean - the unsmiling immigration official took my Cuban visa papers but did n't stamp my passport , a courtesy extended to all American visitors , legal or otherwise . <p> Our group of 16 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a retired FBI agent and an official with the U.S. Department of Agriculture . Several told me they opted for a legal tour because they had a lot to lose - government jobs , pensions , security clearances - if caught visiting Cuba illegally . Others said they just wanted the convenience of an organized tour . <p> Because of a last-minute reservations mix-up , we got to stay at the Hotel Nacional , the grandest hotel in Cuba . Designed by the same architect who built the Breakers in Palm Beach and financed by the American Mafia , it was once the regular Havana address of Al Capone ; Frank Sinatra attended a mob convention there in 1946 . The hotel , next to the seaside promenade known as the Malecon , has been painstakingly restored and looks every bit as glamorous as it did in its heyday . But there are weird , post-revolution touches . In the elegant , high-ceilinged lobby , I passed a large photo of Che Guevara playing golf . He was stuck in a sand trap . <p> " You 're going to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not hell , either , " said our Cuban guide , Siul Mancebo , during our introductory briefing . <p> Mancebo surprised me . He worked for Amistur , a Cuban government agency , so I was expecting a party-line Fidel apologist . But he answered even our most contentious questions with candor , insight and patience . However , whenever the subject of the big boss came up , Mancebo , a Harry Potter fan , invariably flashed a sly grin and referred to him as " He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named . " <p> Our days and nights were a mix of sightseeing - a walking tour of beautifully restored Old Havana , a visit to the moving Che Guevara memorial in Santa Clara , a cheesy re-enactment of a cannon-firing ceremony at the old Spanish fort guarding Havana 's harbor - and meetings with government and community organizations . <p> One such get-together , with Juan Antonio , the U.S. desk officer with the Instituto Cubano de Amistad con los Pueblos , or ICAP - roughly translated as the Cuban Institute of Friendship - crystallized my worst fears about the tour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we did : about political dissent in general , and specifically about the Varela Project , an attempt by Cubans to institute civil rights through legal referendum . Former president Jimmy Carter brought up the campaign during a speech in Cuba last year , but Antonio dismissed the petition , signed at considerable personal risk by more than 11,000 Cubans , as the insignificant work of a small group of malcontents . And then he flatly asserted that there was no political dissent in Cuba . We did n't bother asking any more questions . <p> Other meetings went better . One steamy-hot night , we drove out to a suburb of Havana , a district of blocky , Soviet-era apartment buildings , for a reception with the Committee for the Defense of the Revolution No. 12 . Every neighborhood in Cuba has a CDR , and they once inspired fear and paranoia : They were essentially Mrs. Kravitz-style neighborhood snoops who kept notes on anyone who dared speak out against the Castro regime . Many Cubans are habitually wary of them , but they have mostly evolved into neighborhood improvement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a cul-de-sac , where the whole neighborhood - 150 people - had turned out . Cuban flags hung everywhere , and children stood at attention in their tidy school uniforms . It took a minute for us to realize this was all for us . <p> There were stern speeches , mostly about the five Cubans being held in American jails for spying on anti-Castro exiles in Miami , followed by proclamations of friendship between the Cuban and American peoples . Then a big bottle of rum came out , plastic cups were filled to the rim , toasts were made , salsa music erupted from speakers , and we all danced together in the street . <p> There was never as much free time as I would have liked , but there was some . Late in the afternoon , I always tried to drop by the rooftop bar of the Hotel Ambos Mundos , where I 'd sip an invigorating mojito - sort of a Cuban mint julep - while watching the sunset over the tiled roofs of Old Havana . At night , several of us visited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with hot Latin jazz and the smoke of a hundred Montecristo cigars . <p> In Trinidad , a handsome colonial city on Cuba 's south coast , we toured a hospital where everything , from the waiting-room benches to the laboratory equipment , looked as antiquated and decrepit as the 1950s Studebakers rumbling through the streets . And yet by many important public health benchmarks , including infant mortality and average life span , Cuba is equal to or better than the United States . <p> We discovered one reason for this when we visited a neighborhood medical clinic . There was one such clinic for every 75 households in Trinidad . The doctor was required to live there , in an upstairs apartment . In the mornings he and a nurse were available for drop-in visits ; in the afternoons they went door-to-door to check on residents . By law , they had to visit each household three times each year . All this was free to the Cuban people . " In Cuba , " the doctor told me , " we do n't have a lot of technological @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " <p> I thought about the last time I called my HMO and tried to get an appointment . <p> Our final people-to-people meeting turned out to be the highlight of the trip . On the itinerary it did n't sound promising : a visit with a neighborhood improvement association in a Havana suburb called Lawton . But arriving there after driving through block after block of dreary , socialist-style apartment houses was like the moment when Dorothy wakes up in Oz and everything turns to Technicolor . <p> The entire neighborhood was an open-air art gallery . Residents had painted the walls with fanciful murals of everyone from Che Guevara to John Lennon . There was a triumphal arch made of old hubcaps painted in bright colors . Whimsical sculptures peeked out from behind bushes . The supports of a basketball backboard were painted in rainbow colors , and someone had crocheted a wild-looking net for the hoop . <p> And here 's the thing : This was n't a program administered by the Ministry of Neighborhood Culture or some such bureaucracy . The residents had done it all themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood and their own lives . And there was more : They operated a neighborhood academy , with dance classes for children and computer courses for adults . Anyone with a particular skill taught it to everyone else . <p> We were welcomed into homes , which were invariably cramped but spotless , and eventually ended up on a rooftop terrace , where we were given seats of honor as the neighborhood staged an impromptu pageant for us . Children in school uniforms danced , a 4-year-old recited a poem , a man of sinewy muscles performed a modern dance , another told a fable . All the while , the neighborhood 's leader , Manuel Diaz Baldrich , plied us with ham sandwiches , sugar cookies and homemade apple wine . <p> Eventually a guitar came out and we all ended up arm in arm , singing the only song we all knew : " La Guantanamera . " It sounds hokey , I know , but it was truly a moving and heartfelt moment for both visitors and Cubans . When we collected a modest sum of dollars and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ welled up in his eyes . We were apparently the first organized group of outsiders - certainly the first Americans - to visit this neighborhood , and we were treated like visiting dignitaries . <p> As the homeward flight began its final descent into Los Angeles , a jolt of fear shot through me as I filled out the U.S. Customs declaration form and came to the space that read , " Countries visited outside the United States . " My hand trembled slightly as I wrote , in big block letters , " CUBA . " And then , expecting that I would receive the full and painstaking attention of the customs people , I listed every last item I was bringing home : The 20 Montecristos , the bottle of Havana Club rum , the four Che postcards , the Jose Marti T-shirt , the salsa CD , the typed poem from a street poet , the 2-inch statue of He-Who-Must-Not- Be-Named . <p> At the customs station in LAX , I handed the card to the officer and braced for the worst . He did n't so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arriving from Mazatlan or Frankfurt , he waved me through with a brisk , " Welcome home . " <p> I still have trouble believing it . <p> IF YOU GO <p> PERMITS : Under current U.S. law , there are two ways Americans can travel to Cuba legally .
