Just before twilight on a balmy September New York evening , Dr. Maslow Atkins set out for a jog in Central Park and never came back . He calculated that he had just the right amount of time to run south along the path closest to Central Park West to Fifty-ninth Street and back . Dr. Atkins was a man of regular habits . He timed himself on each outing , knew his speeds and his muscles . And the denizens who claimed the park as their own knew them , too . Like many compulsive runners , Maslow felt edgy when deprived of his exercise . That day he 'd watched a silvery morning turn to angry afternoon thunderstorms , and he 'd been preoccupied by the threat of possibly having to run in the rain . The nagging irritation caused the slightest dulling of his senses and , unthinking , the young psychiatrist made a blunder in his work . Maslow Atkins , M.D. , five foot six inches tall , slender build , strong features muted only slightly by the perpetual beginnings of a beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ occasionally break free of its crest and fall forward to tickle his brow . Not large or classically handsome , Maslow was most notable for his eyes , which were , in turn , light brown , dark brown , and green , depending on his mood and the color of his shirts . His eyes were the most arresting aspect of his person , piercingly sharp in all his humors . At thirty-two Maslow was a man not quite finished . He was a fully licensed psychiatrist , but not yet a father , not married , and not even fully certified to practice his chosen subspecialty of psychoanalysis . Throughouttheyears of his training he had kept his head down and worked hard . Coming and going from his building every morning in his suits and ties , and every evening in his running clothes , with the water bottle hanging on his hip , he looked like one of the thousands of affluent people of his age who flocked to New York City from all over the country and the world to build a career , to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He could have been a banker , a doctor , a lawyer , an advertising executive , a money manager . In any case , he had the appearance of a serious professional on the rise . In fact , Maslow was a thoughtful person eager to do some good in life . And he was not from somewhere else . He was a New Yorker , born and bred just across the park on the East Side . Park Avenue , to be exact . He 'd been a city brat and thought he knew all the angles . As a doctor , his guiding principle was the physician 's oath : First , do no harm . And his personal rules about his own conduct were so strict that he would not take a drink even in a social situation lest it make him stupid or spin him out of control . All through the moody afternoon , he 'd brooded about his patient Allegra . Her name was lovely and light . The word conjured quicksilver in his mind . In music , Allegro meant fast . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joy . Allegra , the petite raven-haired young woman of twenty ; should have been as spirited and confident as she was beautiful . But she was not spirited and joyful . She was very troubled . Maslow felt an unusually deep connection with her and did n't know why . Sometimes he thought she was copying his mannerisms . Her smile and the way she expressed things were oddly familiar . So were some of the stories she told , familiar even though she had not come from here . The way she crossed her legs and pursed her lips when she was angry were particularly disturbing to him . But most disturbing of all , was the fact that sometimes she starved herself and sometimes she cut her own flesh . In their session that day Allegra had told Maslow that in the first moments after she went to work on herself with a razor and watched the blood bubble up out of the cuts on her belly , she felt bliss . Then , nonchalantly , she 'd lifted her blouse for him and showed the scars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scored across her slender torso had made him queasier than anything he 'd seen in medical school . She was his charge , his patient , and he was not working quickly enough to stop her . He was particularly chilled by the fact that whole rows of the red seams on her belly were recent , occurring without his knowledge after she 'd started seeing him . A few were brand-new . The idea that she hurt herself after sessions with him disturbed him deeply . That day after showing off her scars , she 'd expressed confusion about sometimes caring about her father despite the horrific things he 'd done to her . Maslow remarked that children loved their parents no matter what they did . She 'd become enraged at him and had left his office in tears . Ever since , he 'd been in a panic about what she might do to herself . He was still worrying about it at seven o'clock when he returned home from work . He lived in a huge sixty-year-old co-op that took up a whole block on Central Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The heavyset evening doorman called Ben stood tinder the canopy , watching him approach . " Sure is , " Maslow agreed . Ben stepped forward to open the heavy glass door for him . " Thanks . " Maslow waved , then crossed the cavernous lobby , newly decorated in mauve and cream . The elevator took him to the fifth floor , where his one-bedroom apartment faced the side street . Hurrying now , he peeled off his clothes , grabbed socks , Nike Airs , shorts , T-shirt from a shelf in the closet and pulled them on . In the kitchen he filled his water bottle from the tap and put into his fanny pack a couple of granola bars , his apartment keys , and the slender canister of pepper spray that looked like a pen . He did n't take his wallet . He did n't need money to run , and he certainly did not consider the problems of identification should something happen to him . He was a New Yorker and thought nothing could possibly happen to him . He was in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In the lobby , Ben opened the front door for him again and scanned the sky . " I do n't know , " he said shaking his head . " Watch out for that rain . They say there 's more to come . " " Not tonight , " Maslow replied confidently . He picked up his feet and trotted across the street toward the park , his heart lifting at the prospect of an activity that always eased his distress . Twilight was his favorite time of day in the park , and voices on the other side of the wall indicated he was not alone . Then , just before he entered the park , he saw his patient . She jumped up from the bench and came over . " Hi . " " Hello , Allegra . " He wanted to say no more . He wanted to slip by , but she would n't let him pass . " I want to tell you something . " " Why do n't you tell me in session tomorrow , " he said gently . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Angry again , she took off down Central Park West . He stopped for a moment to catch his breath and compose himself . Immediately to his left was the playground . To his right was Eighty-first Street . He crossed and entered the park , heading downtown . That evening it had an eerie quality , almost as if he were entering a land of remote rain forests and steamy , sun-basted jungles . At Seventy-ninth Street the canopies of huge old oaks arched over the sidewalk , high above the man-made arbor , which itself was densely covered with wisteria . Rain droplets clung to the leaves and glittered like diamonds in the last of the daylight that filtered through the layers of branches . The air was moist and smelled of earth . Maslow inhaled deeply , willing calm into his soul . He worked with very sick people in the hospital . There , staff was around him , and he knew how to protect himself . With patients in private practice it was different , and he did n't always know the right thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was glad that he would be able to consult with his supervisor in an hour to talk about Allegra , to get perspective and advice . The sidewalk split . He took the route to the east and moved deeper into the park , heading toward the bridle path where he liked to run . The ground would be wet , but there would n't be any horses this late . A high-pitched scream of surprise and pain stopped Maslow mid-stride . The cry came out of nowhere and was over in a second . Maslow spun around , searching for the source . He had n't even picked up his pace yet . The bridle path was ahead of him just out of sight . Behind him , he could hear cars splashing through the puddles as they headed across the park to the East side . He knew he was up at the very northern tip of the rowboat lake , but it was still deep summer and the fully leafed trees hid the view on the other side of the railing that served as a barrier between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led down to the water 's edge . In other seasons the lake and a footbridge were visible in the distance , appearing unexpectedly like some magical place in a fairy story . Today nothing could be seen through the mist . The cry came again , this time a sustained wail . Maslow leaned over the split-rail fence and peered into the curtain of dripping leaves . " Where are you ? What 's happened ? " " Someone 's down here ! She fell . " An excited voice came from below him . Maslow pushed some dripping branches aside . The fallen tree that spanned a small ravine in a clearing came into view . Long ago the log had been stripped of its bark and deeply carved with designs like a totem pole . Maslow had seen kids sitting on it many times and guessed that whoever had fallen had fallen from there . For many people the first rules of New York City were , do n't make eye contact with strangers and do n't stop for anything . But Maslow was trained to move toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the railing , pushed through the bushes , and stepped into the clearing . Down in the crevice beneath the carved log bridge he saw blue-jeaned legs skewed awkwardly from the body attached to them . The face was pressed down into the wet grass , but he had a chilling feeling that the crumpled body was Allegra 's . " I think she 's dead , " screamed the voice , now identifiable as male and filled with adrenaline . " Hold on , I 'm coming . Do n't touch her , I 'm coming , " he cried . He scrambled over the carved log , lost his footing , and half-slid , half-plunged down the hill . The man at the bottom reached down to help him up , but the arm that snaked around his neck was surprisingly strong . It jerked him back . He staggered and lost his balance . He could n't reach his mace or his cell phone , could n't land a good kick to the person behind him . He panicked and started yelling , then the rock hit his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't feel the branch hitting him , or the feet kicking him , or that he was lifted up , slung over someone 's back , and hauled away like a large piece of garbage . On Park Avenue , Central Park West , and in Long Island City , three sets of parents did n't know where their kids were .
