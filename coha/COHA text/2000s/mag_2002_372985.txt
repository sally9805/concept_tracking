Did the U.S. Ignore 9/11 Warnings ? <P> It seems that the White House was aware of unspecified terrorist threats prior to Sept. 11 SPECIAL REPORT , May 27 , but is it right to blame the President or his staff ? They did n't know exactly when these attacks were to take place or where or how . Has everyone forgotten who the true terrorists were that day ? The most important thing to remember is that thousands of lives were lost . People should stop blaming those who , even if they had done everything in their power , probably would n't have been able to stop the attacks . We should now focus on how to keep this from ever happening again . CAITLIN LOUGHEED Glasgow <P> So the information available prior to Sept. 11 did not justify grounding commercial air traffic . But what about tightening security ? Were intermediate measures inconceivable ? Why is everything in this Administration always one extreme or the other ? Good or evil ; for us or against us ; fly planes or ground planes ? JEFFREY SAINIO @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Bush Administration ; no one could have envisioned the atrocities of Sept. 11 . But logic dictates that at the very least , intelligence information about suspicious activities should have been conveyed to the security authorities at airports . It 's not that we expected perfect foresight , just common sense . ERNESTO VALDES Houston <P> With all the blame being thrown around , distracting the President from his job and dividing us all , maybe we should blame the car-rental companies whose autos let the terrorists get to the airports ; or the architect of the World Trade Center for not foreseeing that a fully fueled airplane might crash into the buildings , melt the girders and cause a collapse ; or the landlords who rented to terrorists . How silly is that ? Forget " shoulda , woulda , coulda , " and focus on " what are we gon na do from now on ? " SANDRA HOCHSTEDLER South Bend , Ind . <P> Monday-morning quarterbacking makes people think we could 've done better . Poppycock ! No one could have predicted Sept. 11 . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You failed ! " is stupidity at its worst . The complainers should come up with a procedure that would treat all threats with equal concern . MARCIA KULP York , Pa . <P> We must stop trying to blame any one person or group for Sept. 11 while we attempt to prevent further attacks . We should take a look at what happened during the attack on Pearl Harbor and afterward and then work as a country to accomplish our goals . As with Pearl Harbor , we were all complacent , thinking we were immune and not realizing the potential of our enemy . Everyone is accountable : the news media , the CIA , our military , Congress and the general public . But instead of working as a team , everyone is pointing fingers . How soon we forgot the lessons of Pearl Harbor and became complacent once more . BOYD BARKER COLONEL , U.S.A.F. ( RET . ) Ogden , Utah <P> The question America needs to ask itself is not why were n't we told ? It is why did n't we expect this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a perceived enemy , instead of attempting to come to terms with it . The West should ask itself why so much of the world finds unacceptable and seeks to change its materialistic dogmatism .
