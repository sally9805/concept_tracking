INTRODUCTION // I learned how to cover race riots by telephone . They did n't pay me enough at my first newspaper job to venture onto the grounds of South Boston High School when bricks were being thrown . Instead , I would telephone the headmaster and ask him to relay to me the number of broken chairs in the cafeteria each day . A white colleague dispatched to the scene would fill in the details for me. // I 've spent 30 years in journalism since then chronicling stories like that - places where truth and consequences collide , rub up against each other , and shift history 's course . None of that prepared me for 2008 and the astonishing rise of Barack Obama. // It is true that he accomplished what no black man had before , but it went farther than that . Simply as an exercise in efficient politics , Obama ' 08 rewrote the textbook . His accomplishment was historic and one that transformed how race and politics intersect in our society . Obama is the leading edge of this change , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that grows deeper every day . // " When people do something that they 've never done before , I think that makes it easier to do it a second time , " David Axelrod , the Obama campaign 's chief strategist , told me just days after Obama won . " So when people vote for an African American candidate , I think itmakes it easier for the next African American candidate . " // The next African American candidates - and a fair share of those already in office , subscribe to a formula driven as much by demographics as destiny . When population shifts - brought about by fair housing laws , affirmative action and landmark school desegregation rulings - political power is challenged as well . It happened in Boston , New York , Chicago and every other big city reshaped by an influx of European immigration . It is happening again now in Miami and Los Angeles , in suburban Virginia and in rural North Carolina , where the political calculus is being reshaped by Latino immigrants . With African Americans , freighted with the legacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel guilty for the sins of their ancestors , the shift has been more scattered and sporadic - yet no less profound . // Boston was awash in the sort racial drama that foreshadows dramatic change when I began my journalism career at the Boston Herald American in 1977. // While I was attending Simmons College , the Federal courts demanded that the city 's very political school committee fix the city 's racially unbalanced education system . // The solution , imposed by U.S. District Court Judge W. Arthur Garrity in 1974 , seemed pretty straightforward . Send white children to black neighborhoods and black children to white neighborhoods . It came to be known as forced busing. // The idea was to impose balance where it no longer existed . The optimistic reasoning was that the resources  --  teachers , textbooks , shared experience  --  would follow . But history now shows us busing - moving 20,000 students to and fro in search of quality education was , in fact , a far more radical notion than originally envisioned . It struck at the heart of neighborhood and racial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so in Irish South Boston and black Roxbury. // White residents of insular neighborhoods railed - sometimes violently - against the incursion into their neighborhood schools . Black residents in Roxbury railed right back . // As I walked to my college classes in Boston 's Fenway neighborhood that fall , I saw the result with my own eyes  --  Boston 's finest in riot gear stepping in to prevent clashes at English High School . It was a scene that played out again and again all over the city , all over the country . // " The white kids do n't like black kids and black kids do n't like white kids , " one white student said after one of the melees I covered by phone . " All of it is prejudice . All I know is that no one 's getting any education . " // " It 's a perfect example that forced desegregation and forced busing does not work , " Elvira Pixie Palladino , an anti-busing member of the school committee told me at the time . // White students fled the city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city 's education system became majority black within a decade . By 2000 , only a quarter of the city 's children were white . Drastically fewer - under 14 percent - were enrolled in the city 's elementary schools . // It took some years , and a more sophisticated understanding of how race and poverty intersect , for me to begin to understand that what I saw in Boston was about more than just black and white kids not liking each other . It was the beginning of a power shift that was defined by , but not limited to , race . // I moved to Baltimore in 1981 , where the tipping point I had witnessed taking shape in Boston was a little farther along . When I arrived , the city 's leaders were still mostly white , but 56 percent of the city 's residents were already nonwhite , a number that grew to 64 percent by 2000. // On the surface , Baltimore 's political vibe was less charged than Boston 's , but the power shifts were no less significant . The city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ downtown with a national aquarium and a Disney-like harbor development that brought tourists in droves . Twin baseball and football stadiums were poised to sprout on downtown 's southern edge . Gleaming condominiums and hotels replaced what had been rundown waterfront docks . Schaefer was hailed in national magazines as an urban savior . Howard Cosell told a Monday Night Football audience that Schaefer was " the genius mayor . " // But not far from the glittering downtown development most convention visitors saw , the picture was more complicated . Crime was climbing . The schools were sliding . And change was in the offing . // Schaefer , an unmarried curmudgeon used to getting his own way , was suspicious of change . And he was doubly suspicious of any call for change that seemed rooted in racial claim . That meant that he would also be suspicious of me , a black woman whose job it was to ask him questions he did not like . As he growled and snapped at me - and , honestly , at most other reporters too - I came to realize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary byproduct of sandpaper change . // In 1983 , Billy Murphy , a black judge and scion of a prominent local family decided to use the sandpaper . Schaefer was still immensely popular , but he was also aware that new minority majorities had recently swept black mayors into office for the first time in cities like Atlanta , and that the barrier was about to fall that year in Philadelphia as well . // In the end , Murphy turned out to be a pretty inadequate Democratic primary candidate , disorganized and unfocused . Even though then-Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young , Martin Luther King 3rd and comedian and activist Dick Gregory came to town to campaign for him , Schaefer still managed to snare fully half of the black vote , in a majority black city . // Even in defeat though , Murphy 's challenge was enough to open some eyes to the possibility that the " mayor for life , " as Schaefer had been dubbed , might be displaced . Perhaps it was time for a candidate who looked like most of the people who lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , openly detested Murphy and refused to speak his name aloud . Still , he saw the handwriting on the wall . // Four years later , Baltimore did get its black mayor when , after 16 years in charge , Schaefer was elected governor and selected a successor to fill his unexpired term . Clarence " Du " Burns , the affable City Council president who rose to that position from humble beginnings as a locker room attendant , was only too happy to claim a job he may never have been able to win outright . " I got standing ovations at churches , " Burns marveled years later . " I had n't done anything for them , but I was the first black mayor , y'understand ? " // Burns , who learned the ways of city politics behind every closed door at City Hall , ended up spending 17 years there , but only 11 months as mayor . The first time he ran for the job outright , Burns was defeated by a younger , politically unannointed Yale and Harvard-educated attorney , a black man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had abandoned a prestigious post in the Carter White House to return home to Baltimore . " I thought why did he give up working in the White House ? " said his former White House colleague Christopher Edley Jr . " What 's going on ? And he said , I 'm going to indict a few bad guys , make some connections in the corporate world and run for office . " // That is exactly what Schmoke did , first winning election as state 's attorney before making the run for City Hall . Even though he was up against the well-oiled Schaefer machine , Schmoke defeated Burns by 5,000 votes by capturing the imagination of Baltimore voters - black and white - in a way neither Murphy nor Burns , with their old-school ties and backroom ways , could not . // " I was kind of the beneficiary in a way of a change sparked by the latter end of civil rights movement , " said Schmoke , who is now the dean of the Howard University School of Law , which produced Thurgood Marshall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rights act , which opened up so many opportunities throughout the country , started to hit its stride by 1980 , and people built on that . " // That trend was also in evidence about 40 minutes down the interstate highway in Prince George 's County , Maryland . By 1984 , I had taken my unintentional road trip through sandpaper politics to this Washington suburb , where  --  - between 1980 and 1990 - the African American population spurted from 37 to 50 percent . During that same period , nearly 77,000 whites moved elsewhere - a loss of nearly 20 percent of the county 's white population . // The county 's power structure was in the midst of a corresponding shift from mostly white to mostly black when I was covering it for the Washington Post . As occurred with Schmoke in Baltimore , the resulting friction provided for a memorable foreshadowing of what was later to be revealed on the national stage . // Wayne Curry was Prince George 's County 's version of Kurt Schmoke - but with a little backroom dealing experience thrown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned early on to navigate the shoals of the backwater politics that had defined this collection of poor- and middle-class black and white suburbs and tobacco-growing rural communities . // Middle-class blacks were thronging to Prince George 's , replacing farmland with cul de sacs , and even gated golf course communities . Between 1979 and 1989 , the county 's median household income nearly doubled . As a result , Pee Gee , as it was still derisively called by people who did not live there , had become the home of the most prosperous populations of African Americans in the nation . By 2005 , 66% of the county was black . // Curry , who made his mark as a real estate development lawyer , parlayed his business connections into two terms as county executive from 1994 to 2002 . Over the years , he managed to establish close ties to both the existing white political establishment and the emerging black one . // In his salad days , Curry was considered a rabble rouser , a smooth talker who could speak the language of the moneyed developer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . In short , he was the kind of guy who made white and black people nervous . Now 58 years old and watching those following in his footsteps from the sidelines , Curry has mixed feelings about the generation of black politicians now rising up . " I do n't automatically see it as a good thing , " he told me . " I think it could be a very , very discouraging moment , in fact , if once guys get in those positions they do n't have an idea or theory about who to help or why  --  just to become figureheads that are n't doing much of anything to make it better for people across the board . " Elected as a Clinton delegate to the 2008 Democratic National Convention , Curry endorsed Obama only after Clinton dropped out in June . // Curry 's concerns echo throughout any discussion of black politics today . What was the point of electing an African American to high office if their ties to the black community do not bind them tightly enough to black causes ? Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , a breakthrough worth having ? Or as Georgetown sociology professor Michael Eric Dyson put it to me : " If this the price we pay for that kind of access , we 'd rather not have it . " // By the time the Post assigned me to cover the Rev. Jesse Jackson 's second Presidential race in 1988 , I had grown familiar with variations on this argument , which usually cropped up whenever a new black face intruded on a previously all-white , and sometimes all-black , political landscape . The toughest tests often played out from within the black community itself , where , in most cases political achievement and the conflict that came with it , was only a generation old . // In 1984 , the Reverend Jesse Jackson ran for President , doubled the number of black voters casting ballots in that year 's New York primary and startled the political world with his powerful " I Am Somebody " imagery and with his unabashedly racial appeals . It did not bother him one bit to use the assassination of Martin Luther , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in part because he was a witness to it . // " On April 4 , 1968 , there was a crucifixion in Memphis , " he would say while campaigning . " In New York this week , we began to roll the stone away . The crucifixion of April 1968 will become the resurrection of April 1984. " // Jackson scared people , and he was perfectly aware of it . The headline in that week 's Time magazine reflected the nervous political zeitgeist of the moment : " What Does Jesse Really Want ? " // Jackson 's 1988 run was different from the more quixotic 1984 candidacy . By then , white faces had joined the black faces on the Jackson bandwagon . // His campaign manager , Gerald Austin , was a white man . And some of his most influential supporters - like Democratic operatives Harold Ickes and Ann Lewis - would go on four years later to help get Bill Clinton elected . // Jackson had worked energetically to reach beyond his black church base to establish himself as a force to be reckoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the race , " he told a crowd at a predominantly Hispanic Denver Roman Catholic parish where former Senator Gary Hart sat in the front pew . " That makes me Colorado 's favorite son . " // Jackson 's ability to enlarge his base continued to rattle the political establishment . He emerged the victor of the 1988 Michigan primary . This time , the Time magazine cover line shrieked : " Jesse ! ? " Writers began to speculate that he would sweep lily white Wisconsin too . // I interviewed the mayor of Sheboygan , Wisconsin during that period . Upon meeting me , he anxiously pointed out the framed pictures he had on his wall of boxers and other athletes , to prove that some of his best friends were black . // I was only surprised that he actually said this to my face , and the exchange convinced me that maybe this was not Jackson country . The following week , Michael Dukakis trounced Jackson in the Democratic primary , not only in Sheboygan , but in all of Wisconsin . // Still , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up of far more than the traditional civil rights constituency . They were , in fact , the left-wing version of the very same people who flocked to rallies that year for another man of the cloth  --  Pat Robertson . // By now , Jackson preached a now-familiar sermon everywhere he went - the power of hope . Obama would appropriate that powerful theme decades later . Jackson 's effort eventually crumbled amid intraparty acrimony , but by the time the August convention rolled around he had won in more than a dozen contests , and there were a breathless few months where much seemed possible . // That spring , Jackson frequently told a story on the stump about a white man who approached him in Beaumont , Texas to tell him he , too , had attended the famous Selma to Montgomery civil rights March in Alabama in 1965. // But , the man told Jackson , he 'd been there with the Ku Klux Klan . Time passed . Priorities changed . And now , the man said , he was supporting him . // " Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preached . // The more possible the nomination seemed , the more Jackson attempted to broaden his appeal . He kissed a lot of white babies for photographers that spring , and suddenly started eschewing talk of storming the gate in favor of more mainstream rhetoric . " I do n't understand boundless liberalism , " he told the Women 's Economic Club of Detroit , " Neither do I understand static conservatism . " // " We opened up an exclusive club and turned the mainstream into a flowing river , " he told me at the time . " By broadening the stream , my views are now in the center . " // These voters felt disenfranchised . Their sense of grievance - the conviction that no one was listening or speaking to them - was about more than race . It was about shared grievance too . Even before Michael S. Dukakis captured the Democratic nomination , Willie Brown , the canny San Francisco mayor who served as Jackson 's national campaign chairman , correctly began calling the campaign the " Jackson movement . " // The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dukakis refused to pick Jackson as his running mate . But , as the Democrats prepared to convene in Atlanta to nominate their ticket , the resourceful Chicago preacher did not immediately leave the stage . He took his entourage by bus from Illinois to Georgia . Along the way , the vanquished candidate stopped at a rally at Jefferson Street Baptist Church in Nashville , where he spoke in front of a large banner strung behind the pulpit . " Jesse You 're A Winner , " it read . // But even that would not work out as planned . As Jackson spoke , the banner behind his head began to sag and peel . Organizers struggled to right the banner , then remove it . But as it fell , its weight ripped a second banner almost in half . That one read : " Where Do We Go From Here ? " // Still , Jackson managed a breakthrough of sorts , one that went beyond politics . Everywhere , the terrain was changing . Black politicians were going mainstream . Twenty years later , network cameras @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tears streaming down his face , as Obama walked onstage to accept the Presidency . // In 1990 , L. Douglas Wilder , a Korean War veteran raised in Richmond , Virginia 's segregated schools , was elected the Commonwealth 's 66th governor - and the nation 's first African American state leader ever . He won the election , but by a lead far narrower than pre-election polls had predicted . This came to be known as the Bradley Effect , after former Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley , an African American who lost the 1982 race for California governor to a white man , George Deukmejian , even though polls had shown him winning by as much as 22 points . // " People lied ! " Wilder told me years later , but months before Obama would be elected . " And they will continue to lie . Racism is never going to go away , and we should n't convince ourselves that it could . " // There has , however , been considerable debate about the Bradley Effect . One Deukmejian pollster said the conclusion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Field , who had no other way to explain why his pre-election polling was off the mark . " The Bradley Effect was born amidst some major polling errors and a confusing array of mixed predictions , hardly a firm foundation to construct a theory , " pollster V. Lance Tarrance Jr . wrote 26 years later . Obama himself called the theory " outdated and overstated . " // In fact , the question of how voters behaved in secret when faced with a racial choice increasingly cut the opposite way . In the 2006 midterm elections , African Americans lost four out of five statewide races . But in those cases , their losses were foreshadowed - accurately  --  in pre-election polling . Harold Ford Jr. , who ran and lost a race for U.S. Senate , actually drew more votes on Election Day than the last polls predicted he would . // Obama continued that trend . Exit polls showed he not only outperformed 2004 nominee John Kerry among white voters , but that those who made up their minds within the last few days - theoretically the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him as well . RIP : The Bradley Effect . // Once again , Obama became the most famous example of a trend that was already taking hold largely out of the public eye . Other African Americans have also successfully attracted white support over the years , many of them in local and state government . In 1996 , environmentalist and county council member Ron Sims , who marched in civil rights protests with his parents growing up in Spokane , Washington , was appointed to the top executive 's job in Seattle 's overwhelmingly King County , and has since been reelected twice . By 2007 , there were 622 black state legislators , 30 percent of them from predominantly white districts . In 2001 , only abut 16 percent of the black legislators represented majority white areas . // The evolution that has brought us to our latest sandpaper crossroads has been as much generational as racial . Black mayors have been elected , with significant white support , in Cincinnati , Ohio , Buffalo , New York and even Iowa City , Iowa - part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American cities . // Barack Obama 's historic 2008 Presidential campaign touched on all the themes I have covered throughout my career , and all of the layers of meaning that run through black politics . Ambition . Aspiration . Fear . Folly . It was all on display as Obama boarded the roller coaster that ultimately led to the White House . And as he took on that ultimate political challenge , America 's conflicts about race were laid bare , again and again . // Edward W. Brooke , who was elected Massachusetts attorney general in 1962 and , four years later , became the nation 's first post-Reconstruction black U.S. Senator , believes if his state was ready four decades ago , the rest of the country might be now . // " I would love to see a lot of things happen between now and the time I lay me down to rest , " said Brooke , now retired and living in Florida , where he is encouraged by the rise of a new generation of black politicians . " All I 'm saying is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to have that fire in the belly , that desire to achieve , to win that position , and to do something with it when you do win . " // Obama sent Brooke a copy of one of his books , inscribed " Thank you for paving the way . " Brooke responded with a signed copy of his own autobiography , in which he called Obama " a worthy bearer of the torch . " // But the torch-passing was fraught with all of the insecurities and rivalries that can be brought on by consequential change . Hovering over every conflict for these breakthrough candidates has always been the question of race . // A career spent watching politicians of every gender , color and creed trying to sort their way through the abrasions of political change has taught me much . I 've witnessed the uneasy transition from the Civil Rights struggle to direct engagement in electoral politics . As black politicians have broken through , I 've documented the friction that has resulted when new realities , demographic as well as political , confront established customs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no surprise to me when I was briefly caught up in the crosswinds of the very conflict I 'd spent the past year documenting . But it did . Barely 24 hours before I was to moderate the season 's only Vice Presidential debate , John McCain supporters decided to stir the pot ( and , they imagined , throw me off balance ) by suggesting that they had just discovered that this book was to be a piece of pro-Obama puffery. // It was easy enough to discover that this was not true . The book , and its true topic , had been hiding in plain sight for more than a year as I interviewed dozens of subjects and wrote on the topic for more than one national magazine . But I was a hard target to resist - an African American journalist writing about race could not possibly be capable of thinking bigger thoughts , could she ? // In retrospect , this was a small distraction that blew over the second the debate ended . And I quickly came to realize that my brush with sandpaper politics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ African American politicians who had been fighting to establish a political beach head for decades before I - or Barack Obama - for that matter - ever came along . // The difference now is that in the twenty-first century , the breakthrough generation of black politicians is aiming to capture much bigger territory . Obama 's relentless and disciplined giant-slaying campaign is by no means the only story . This book will tell the rest . // // // From the Trade Paperback edition . //
