Cassidy Jones wished her best friend , Larissa King , were Amish at times like these . It would have made life a lot easier , especially when it came to going to parties . Instead of obsessing over which pair of jeans to wear ( either the low-waisted , boot-cut Citizens of Humanity ones that make her appear to have a butt , or the stretch , dark True Religion ones that were perfectly broken in ) , Cassidy could spend her time burying her nose in her sketchbook and drawing while sitting on the beach in Malibu . But that was not her fate today . She was about an hour away from attending a Pepperdine University party with Larissa , and Cassidy knew all too well what that meant . Soon Larissa would be acting the opposite of Amish  --  smoking , drinking , dancing , and perhaps even sexing it up with some college hottie . As for Cassidy , she was preparing for another night spent in the corner like your typical pretty wallflower . Then she told herself that she 'd have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even that did n't make her feel like going out tonight . Maybe her melancholy mood could be chalked up to a bad case of PMS , or maybe it was because she was a few days shy of getting her last report card for the year . That always made her nervous , even though she usuallydid just fine . Maybe it was because she worried her chronic shyness was going to get the better of her once again . Whatever the reason , she looked at Larissa as she got all dolled up and hoped her friend would break one of her well-manicured , Hard Candy-painted nails . Beauty crises had derailed their plans many , many times before , so why not now ? " If this shirt does n't get me groped at least once tonight , I 'm suing the designer . " Larissa tugged at the straps of a rainbow-striped terry cloth tank so that it draped lower on her chest . She posed in front of the mirror hanging from the door of Cassidy 's walk-in closet , flinging her long , straight hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streaks , and they glinted in the late afternoon sunlight streaming through Cassidy 's picture window . " Larissa , " Cassidy reminded her , " you are the designer . " " Too true , " Larissa agreed . " What do you think ? Will it be a hit on the runway ? " " You 'll have Dior begging for mercy . " Cassidy rolled her eyes . Ever since Larissa had picked up an issue of Nylon magazine three months before , it was nearly impossible to tear her away from her sewing machine or get her to talk about anything besides cuts and fabrics . Larissa was convinced she was the next Coco Chanel , and Cassidy was waiting patiently for her to get over her fashion craze the way she 'd gotten over rock climbing , karaoke , and synchronized swimming . They 'd spent four summers together , and Cassidy just loved how Larissa 's ever-so-fleeting passions always took them somewhere unexpected . " Excellent . But if not , " Larissa decided , " I 'll give it to you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll wear it every day . " Cassidy knew that Larissa was well aware of the fact she would n't go anywhere near rainbow-striped terry cloth . She preferred simple , elegant clothes that made her blend in , not stand out . With her porcelain-colored skin , huge blue eyes , and endless lashes , she got enough attention as it was  --  too much , considering she was usually too timid to talk to any guys besides Eric . Even so , she still got tongue-tied around him , and they had been dating for almost two years . Wow , has it really been that long ? she thought . " Look , a little color wo n't kill you . " Larissa sighed , taking in Cassidy 's black crepe button-down shirt from Theory , plain white flip-flops , and short denim skirt . " Come on , I 've got this new eye shadow that would look amazing on you . It 's hardly a color at all . Actually , it 's more of a subtle shimmer . . . . " Larissa began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went . Cassidy giggled to herself , picturing the mess of makeup , loose change , and empty Twizzler wrappers lurking in the bottom . She imagined the bag swallowing Larissa whole , so that only her newly painted lime green toenails stuck out from the top . The image was too good to pass up . She grabbed her sketchbook off the nightstand and began covering a page in small , quick lines . As she drew with her favorite Hello Kitty number-two pencil , she felt the tiny knot she always carried around inside her begin to loosen . Secretly , she called it " social tension "  --  the feeling of always having to say something and never knowing what to say , so that she ended up just not talking and seeming stuck-up to everyone but her closest friends . Drawing was always good for that . It let her enter a silent world where she could sit back and watch without having to say anything at all . In fact , the walls of Cassidy 's room were covered in her sketches : Larissa morphing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ karaoke machine , Eric riding a horse backward along Zuma Beach , and all three of them playing tug-of-war with a giant Twizzler . Her favorite , which she 'd tinted with colored pens and hung prominently over her bed , showed Larissa as Batman and her as Robin , both poised to leap off the roof of their high school and save the desperately bored students trapped inside . It seemed to sum up their friendship perfectly : the way outgoing , talkative Larissa always took the lead and quiet Cassidy was content to play sidekick . Some girls might not have been into playing Haley James to Larissa 's Peyton Sawyer , but Cassidy found it comforting . She did n't want the limelight and liked that Larissa was always thinking of new fun things for them to do . As far as she was concerned , they complemented each other perfectly . Besides , she knew Larissa would n't be so gutsy without Cassidy 's support  --  and if it were n't for Larissa , Cassidy would probably forget how to talk entirely .
