Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . <br> Somewhere in the tunnels of my left ear , I hear my car alerting me to the fact that my door is open . I take vague notice of my brain accepting the message , then I quickly ignore it . The dinging , to which I am now immune , as if someone were pinching me on my arm over and over again until that same spot becomes numb , continues . <br> I run my hands over the cool wood of the steering wheel , then onto the buttery leather seat below , flicking my hands underneath the sweat-basted backs of my thighs . The brochure to this car  --  the one that was filled with a couple who so closely resembled Barbie and Ken that my daughter actually pointed to them and said , " Barbie , " which my husband and I applauded to the point of revelry ( such that people in the dealership craned their necks to see if we 'd been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ter 's vocabulary consisted of , to date , approximately seventeen words , so " Barbie " was another milestone  --  actually made you believe that if you bought the car , you could also buy the life . As if on the weekends , we 'd be careening down sides of mountains or hurtling through white-water-filled rivers or picnicking in a dewy , crisply green meadow at sunset with a field of sunflowers just behind us . <br> Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . <br> Mama . <br> More . <br> Dog . <br> Dada . <br> No . <br> Yes . <br> Kiss . <br> Milk . <br> Ball . <br> Up . <br> Balloon . <br> Hi . <br> Bottle . <br> Cup . <br> Bye . <br> Down . <br> Sleep . <br> I run the list of Katie 's words over in my mind . I have them down cold , of course , because I was the mother who knew these things . I was the mother who dutifully jotted down every milestone ( " 4 months , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 6-month target ! " ) , who nursed her until her first birthday exactly , per the American Academy of Pediatrics ' recommendation ( " I 'm so sad to give it up , " I told friends as wrinkles washed across my forehead to note my air of sincerity ) , and who , as I have mentioned , tallied up Katie 's vocabulary to ensure that she was on track to fulfill her potential . Seventeen words . A gasp ahead of other eighteen-month-olds . <br> And now , we also had " Barbie . " <br> Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Splat . <br> My eyes whip over to the upper corner of the windshield , where mildew-colored bird shit slowly oozes down . Great , I think . Just fucking great . There 's never any bird shit in the goddamn brochure . I inhale and try to release the stress , as my Pilates teacher had taught me to do every Monday , Wednesday , and Friday mornings from 10:00 to 11:00 , after my nanny had arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to pick up ingredients for dinner . I feel the air fill my chest , and it expands like a helium balloon . <br> I count to five and try not to gag . It 's hard , after all , to clear my mind when the scent of fetid milk is wafting from the backseat . On the way home from a playdate yesterday , Katie had dumped her sippy cup on her head , for apparently no reason whatsoever , and since I 'd already exhausted myself pretending to dote on the kids at this seemingly never-ending excruciatingly boring playdate , during which all the moms discussed diaper changes and nanny problems and potential preschool applications , I opted not to clean her car seat . Fuck it , I told myself , as I pulled my darling daughter and her crisp near-black curls from her saturated seat and called her a " silly willy " for dousing herself despite knowing better . Just fuck it . <br> And so I did . Which is why my Range Rover , which should have still smelled like a fine blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petrified puke . <br> The bird shit is snaking its way into the crack between the windshield and the side of the car when I notice that Mrs. Kwon is waving at me from inside of the dry cleaner . She is frantically , frantically flashing her hand through the air , with an alarmed , toothy smile that she wears just about every time I see her . Sometimes the alarm fades into cunning , but the toothiness remains the same . <br> Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . Ding . <br> I heave myself from my car and make the steep step down to the pavement . I turn and look at the backs of my legs : They glisten from the perspiration and are pocked with marks from the seat , such that they form the perfect illusion of sheeny cellulite . I slam the door shut . <br> Suddenly , there is quiet . I could n't hear the dings . But now , I do hear the quiet . <br> <br> " You no look so good , " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hangs across and throughout the ceiling is snaking its way forward until she presses a button , and it stops abruptly . She grabs a pole and reaches up to unhook Henry 's , my husband 's , shirts . " You not sleeping ? Because you really no look so good . " <br> I press my lips together and morph my face into something like a smile . I can feel my cheeks digging into themselves , my dimples cratering . <br> " No , " I say , and shake my head . " Not sleeping too much , I guess . " <br> " What wrong ? " Mrs. Kwon asks , as she wrestles the shirts down to our level . <br> " Nothing . " I shrug . My face muscles are starting to tremble from the weight of the forced smile . " Nothing at all . " <br> " You not being honest , " Mrs. Kwon chastises . " When you no sleep , something is always wrong . " She lands the shirts , much like how I imagine a fisherman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <br> I do n't answer . Instead , I sift through my purse for my wallet . <br> " Have you talk to husband about it ? " Mrs. Kwon is relentless . " You always picking up his things , but I never meet him . Why ? Where is he ? Why he never pick up his own shirts ? " <br> " He 's working , " I say . <br> " Eh , " she responds . " Men always working . They not realizing that the women are working , too . " She gestures behind her . " My husband think that because I am wife , I have to clean , cook , and still do dry-clean business . What does he do ? Nothing ! " She shimmies her hands even more exuberantly than normal . <br> I smile with what I hope to be sympathy and wait for my change , as she punches the cash register with fervor . <br> " You know what you need ? " she asks , as the drawer to the register bounces open . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hue of purple , which she quickly detects . " Do n't you be embarrassed ! Every woman need more sex . You sleep better . Your marriage better . Sex make all things better . " <br> " Well , unfortunately , " I say , trying to swallow the mortification that comes with your dry cleaner giving you advice on your carnal activities , " Henry is in London . And will be for at least another week . " I do n't mention that Henry is nearly always in London or San Francisco or Hong Kong or somewhere that is n't our quaint , homey suburb tucked away thirty miles from Manhattan , where people flee from the city life like fugitives who are n't sure what they 're outrunning . Henry 's constant travel was the price we paid for his success as the youngest partner at his boutique investment bank . <br> " Oooh , that too bad . " Mrs. Kwon 's eyes grow small . " You do look like you need some good sex . " She shrugs and flashes her teeth again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <br> Maybe , I think , as I plod out to my **25;820;TOOLONG new car . But , then again , probably not . <br> <br> Right there , I nearly moaned out load . Yes , harder right there . <br> Garland must have intuited my angst because at that very moment , I feel his fingertips knead into my upper shoulders like a baker might bread . <br> " You 're spasming here , " he whispers just loudly enough so I can hear him over the Enya . I feel my muscle involuntarily clench up and resist the very relief that I 'm trying to offer it . " This entire section of your back is in deep spasm , " he repeats . " We 're going to have to do a lot of work on this today . " <br> I grunt and rearrange my face in the donut cushion so that I , ideally , wo n't look half-alien when Garland is done . Not that he has n't seen me at my worst before : once , on my worst day , I devolved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my torso , releasing what he later told me was " disturbed energy " that came unjiggered through the power of massage . But still . It was n't a look to which I aspired . Not least because , as my friends from Pilates informed me , Garland , with his sinewy forearms and espresso-colored hair , would occasionally put his hands in places where , perhaps , management would n't approve . But where my friends very much did . <br> But I 'd been seeing him every other week for nearly four months , and as of yet , nothing inappropriate at all . Which , in some ways , was a relief . Henry and I had met at twenty-seven , and for the past seven years , there had been no one else . Nor had I truly wanted there to be . I was a wife . I was a good wife , and fantasizing about your masseuse , no , fantasizing about anyone was outside the bounds of what I characterized a " good " wife to be . I attended the requisite cocktail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damask sheets every Saturday . I ironed Katie 's gingham dresses so that there was n't a literal thread out of place . <br> Of course , despite my best and most public efforts , my subconscious occasionally led me down paths that my current consciousness could n't control . So while Garland worked his delicious finger magic on me , I could n't help but wonder how it would feel if those fingers wound their way beyond the acceptable parameters of what they teach you in massage school . <br> Continues ...
