<p> It was the ugliest , and the most beautiful , Fourth of July parade ever held on Nancy Muller 's street . <p> Ten days after an illegal campfire swelled into the Angora Fire and destroyed 254 homes in South Lake Tahoe , the neighbors on Pyramid Circle stuck American flags in the ruins and marched through a forest of blackened trees , on streets lined with car skeletons . <p> Muller , a Tahoe Middle School teacher , walked arm in arm with a parent of one of her students , and waved a flag at U.S. Forest Service trucks in the parade . <p> It was the first time she felt a pang of joy since losing the home her ex-husband built for her in 1983 . <p> " There really were n't people watching the parade this year  --  we were all in it instead , " Muller said . <p> A fire survivor opened her home for a potluck , and apple pies multiplied as the day went on . A man who was camping near the lake heard about the parade and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day made Muller certain she wanted to rebuild in the same spot , on the edge of the forest in Tahoe Paradise , within walking distance of Seneca Pond , where the fire broke out . After the fire , she was n't so sure . <p> " You want to live here for the beauty , of course , but this tragedy just reminded me that it 's the community that 's really your home , not the physical house . " <p> Friends , old and new , are getting Muller back on her feet . <p> She laughs , but in the month since the fire , she has n't had to open her wallet for a thing . Immediately after the fire , residents set up evacuation centers with meals , clothing , bedding and offers of free housing . <p> Buddhists handed out free Visa check cards . A sporting-goods store gave out warm coats to fire victims for the coming winter . Every time Muller pulls into the driveway to her rental , she finds another donation left by a friend  --  a bedside table @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <p> Her insurance company  --  Ameriprise , that she purchased through Costco  --  is paying the rent on the home where Muller , her husband and her 17-year-old stepson , Justin , will live until they can return to Pyramid Circle . <p> Muller was most touched when her ex-husband , who built the home that burned down , offered to rebuild for much less than a contractor would charge . <p> " I want to make sure she gets through this as smoothly as possible , working with a friend instead of a stranger , " said her ex , Ken Muller of Montera . <p> Ameriprise already cut Nancy Muller a check for $280,000 to rebuild , but there are a lot of steps that have to happen before she can pour a foundation . <p> First , her lot has to be cleared of debris and the 200-foot burned pine trees have to be hauled away . <p> A week after the July Fourth parade , debris removal trucks made their way to Muller 's street  --  the first street in the fire zone to be cleared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination of payments from homeowners ' insurance policies to cover cleanup costs . <p> Seven million dollars is available from the California Integrated Waste Management Board , said cleanup manager Todd Thalhamer . So far , six lots have been cleared on Pyramid Court and Pyramid Circle , first in line because those streets had a high number of residents request the service , and also because they had several homes under construction when the fire broke out , he said . <p> Environmental engineers from Emeryville donned white chemical suits , checked the rubble of Muller 's house for radiation , and found it clean . Next , a backhoe dug out the concrete foundation . Her lot was cleared 6 inches down into the soil . <p> " It 's getting easier to look at now , " said Muller , who returned July 13 to check on the cleanup . " I 'm sort of numb to it now . " <p> Muller is most concerned with finding a copy of the plans to the house , because the originals burned in the fire . She needs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of plans . <p> El Dorado County will waive building fees if fire victims use the same footprint to re-create their house . <p> That does n't mean they ca n't build up  --  but Muller is leaning away from adding a second story despite her stepson 's requests to the contrary . <p> " I 'm looking to retire in the next few years , and I have to ask myself if I am going to notice paying a couple hundred more a month in property tax , " she said . <p> Muller is also trying to meet a county deadline to grade her property before the rainy season starts Oct. 15 , the deadline to avoid erosion and runoff into Lake Tahoe . <p> If she ca n't get all the pieces in place by Oct. 15 , she 'll have to wait until May to pour the foundation . <p> " I really do n't want to wait if I do n't have to , " she said . " Because if I wait , then there 's going to be a big line of people all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visiting her charred lot , Muller stopped by the El Dorado County Building Department , and was pleasantly surprised . A worker found a copy of her home 's footprint on microfiche . <p> " This is it ! This is what I need ! " she exclaimed . <p> Buoyed by her success , she stopped by the U.S. Forest Service to see if she could get someone to tell her which trees on her lot are going to recover and which need to be hauled away . <p> The man behind the counter told her he did n't know , did n't know who would know , and suggested going back to the county  --  who told her to ask the Forest Service in the first place . <p> Exasperated , she went back to her rental to continue unpacking . <p> On a shelf next to the television , she set out the few things she salvaged from the ashes : some china cups , ceramic candlesticks , a ceramic bird and a bell . <p> " Some might think it 's a downer , but I like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are all that 's left . " <p> In that moment , she realized she was finally alone . Her husband was back at work , driving a bus . Her stepson was on a school trip to Europe . The relief workers and evacuation centers were packed up and gone . It felt like the days after a funeral , she said . <p> " At first you are surrounded by all these people , and then eventually they all disappear and there you are , alone .
