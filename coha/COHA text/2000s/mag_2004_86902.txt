All day , in San Jose , the parents of late NFL star Pat Tillman were seeing their son get the kind of attention he would 've hated : his face on CNN , teddy bear memorials , a tribute from the White House . // All day , in Bellaire , Ohio , the grandmother of former high school football star Todd Bates was living with a solitary ache she can barely describe : The boy she raised as her own came back from Iraq in a box , and nobody broke into a newscast to announce his death to the nation . // Since 9/11 , all Arizona Cardinals strong safety Pat Tillman wanted was to fight for his country . He took a potential $1,182,000 annual pay cut to jump from the NFL to the Army Rangers in 2002 , and he refused all attempts to glorify his decision . He told friends that he wanted to be treated as no more special than the guy on the cot next to him . ( " He viewed his decision as no more patriotic than that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arizona senator John McCain said . ) Tillman even forbade his family and friends from talking to the press about him . News crews begged for photos , mere shots of him signing his induction papers or piling out of a truck at Fort Benning , Ga. , or getting his first haircut  --  anything . They got nothing . // Since he was a kid , all Bellaire High linebacker Todd Bates wanted was " to be somebody , " his football team chaplain , Pastor Don Cordery , told the Associated Press . When you grow up poor and without your parents around , you get hungry to make your mark . He was n't a good enough player to get a scholarship , yet he desperately wanted to go to college . So in 2002 he took the only road available to him  --  he left home and joined the Ohio Army National Guard . Nobody wanted to take a picture of him getting his haircut . // Tillman , 5 ' 11 " and 200 pounds , joined the only team tougher than the NFL  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Iraq , then went to Afghanistan . He was killed last Thursday in an ambush in the remote eastern Afghan province of Khost . His younger brother Kevin , also a Ranger , escorted his body home . // Bates , 6 feet and 250 pounds , walked eight miles a day with a 50-pound backpack to lose enough weight to join the Army , recalls his grandmother Shirley Bates , who raised him from a baby . He made it to Baghdad and was on a boat patrolling the Tigris River when his squad leader lost his balance and fell overboard . Without a life jacket Bates dived in to rescue him . Both men drowned . It took 13 days to find Bates 's body , on Dec. 23 , one month before his unit returned home . // Tillman 's death shook the country like no other in this war . Makeshift memorials sprang up at his alma mater , Arizona State , and at the Cardinals ' offices in Tempe . The club announced that the plaza around its new stadium will be named Pat Tillman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , commissioner Paul Tagliabue wore a black ribbon with Tillman 's name on it . Some people talked about retiring his number , 40 , league-wide. // Only friends and family grieved for Bates , but deeply . It so tormented Shirley 's companion , 61-year-old Charles Jones  --  the man who helped her raise Todd  --  that he refused to go to the funeral . " If I do n't go , then Toddie ca n't be dead , " he kept saying . He refused to leave the house . He refused to talk much . He refused to eat . Four weeks later he dropped over dead without a word . " He died of a broken heart , " says Shirley . She buried them in the cemetery up the hill from her home , side by side . // Tillman died a hero and a patriot . But his death is a wake-up call to the nation that every day  --  more than 500 times since President Bush declared " Major combat operations in Iraq have ended , " more than 800 times since the invasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to greet their dead child . The only difference this time is that the whole country knew this child . // In the little house in Bellaire , any patriotism was swallowed up by sorrow . " There was no reason for my boy to die , " says Shirley . " There is no reason for this war . There were no weapons found . All we have now is a Vietnam . My Toddie 's life was wasted over there . All this war is a waste . Look at all these boys going home in coffins . What 's the good in it ? " // Athletes are soldiers and soldiers are athletes . Uniformed , fit and trained , they fight for one cause , one team . They take ground and they defend it . Both are carried off on their teammates ' shoulders , athletes when they win and soldiers when they die . // Pat Tillman and Todd Bates were athletes and soldiers . Tillman wanted to be anonymous and became the face of this war . Bates wanted to be somebody and died @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their duty for their country , but I wonder if their country did its duty for them . Tillman died in Afghanistan , a war with no end in sight and not enough troops to finish the job . Bates died in Iraq , a war that began with no just cause and continues with no just reason . // Be proud that sports produce men like this . // But I , for one , am furious that these wars keep taking them .
