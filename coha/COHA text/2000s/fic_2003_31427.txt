When Ellie awoke that morning , it was with the sense that something terrible had happened . Instinctively she reached for Bones , the soft and cuddly stuffed dog who had shared her pillow ever since she could remember . When she 'd had her seventh birthday last month , Andrea , her fifteen-year-old sister , had teased her that it was time to toss Bones in the attic . Then Ellie remembered what was wrong : Andrea had n't come home last night . After dinner , she had gone to her best friend Joan 's house to study for a math test . She had promised to be home by nine o'clock . At quarter of nine , Mommy went to Joan 's house to walk Andrea home , but they said Andrea had left at eight o'clock . Mommy had come back home worried and almost crying , just as Daddy got in from work . Daddy was a lieutenant in the New York State Police . Right away he and Mommy had started calling all of Andrea 's friends , but no one had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drive around to the bowling alley and to the ice cream parlor , just in case Andrea had gone there . " If she lied about doing homework until nine o'clock , she wo n't set foot out of this house for six months , " he 'd said angrily , and then he 'd turned to Mommy : " If I said it once , I 've said it a thousand times  --  I do n't want her to go out after dark alone . " Despite his raised voice , Ellie could tell that Daddy was more worried than angry . " For heaven 's sake , Ted , she went out at seven o'clock . She got to Joan 's . She was planning to be home by nine , and I even walked over there to meet her . " " Then where is she ? " They made Ellie go to bed , and , eventually , she fell asleep waking only now . Maybe Andrea was home by now , she thought hopefully . She slipped out of bed , rushed across the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Be there , she begged . Please be there . She opened the door . Andrea 's bed had not been slept in . Her bare feet silent on the steps , Ellie hurried downstairs . Their neighbor , Mrs. Hilmer , was sitting with Mommy in the kitchen . Mommy was wearing the same clothes she had on last night , and she looked as if she 'd been crying for a long time . Ellie ran to her . " Mommy . " Mommy hugged her and began to sob . Ellie felt Mommy 's hand clutching her shoulder , so hard that she was almost hurting her . " Mommy , where 's Andrea ? " " We ... do n't ... know . Daddy and the police are looking for her . " " Ellie , why do n't you get dressed , and I 'll fix you some breakfast ? " Mrs. Hilmer asked . No one was saying that she should hurry up because the school bus would be coming pretty soon . Without asking , Ellie knew she would n't be going to school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brushed her teeth and hair , and then put on play clothes  --  a turtleneck shirt and her favorite blue slacks  --  and went downstairs again . Just as she sat at the table where Mrs. Hilmer had put out juice and cornflakes , Daddy came through the kitchen door . " No sign of her , " he said . " We 've looked everywhere . There was a guy collecting for some phony charity ringing doorbells in town yesterday . He was in the diner last night and left around eight o'clock . He would have passed Joan 's house on the way to the highway around the time Andrea left . They 're looking for him . " Ellie could tell that Daddy was almost crying . He also had n't seemed to notice her , but she did n't mind . Sometimes when Daddy came home he was upset because something sad had happened while he was at work , and for a while he 'd be very quiet . He had that same look on his face now . Andrea was hiding  --  Ellie was sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early on purpose because she was meeting Rob Westerfield in the hideout , then maybe it got late and she was afraid to come home . Daddy had said that if she ever lied again about where she 'd been , he 'd make her quit the school band . He 'd said that when he found out she had gone for a ride with Rob Westerfield in his car when she was supposed to be at the library . Andrea loved being in the band ; last year she 'd been the only freshman chosen for the flute section . But if she 'd left Joan 's house early and gone to the hideout to meet Rob , and Daddy found out , that would mean she 'd have to give it up . Mommy always said that Andrea could twist Daddy around her little finger , but she did n't say that last month when one of the state troopers told Daddy he 'd stopped Rob Westerfield to give him a ticket for speeding and that Andrea was with him at the time . Daddy had n't said anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how long she 'd been at the library . She did n't answer him . Then he said , " I see you 're smart enough to realize that the trooper who gave Westerfield the ticket would tell me you were with him . Andrea , that guy is not only rich and spoiled , he 's a bad apple through and through . When he kills himself speeding , you 're not going to be in the car . You are absolutely forbidden to have anything to do with him . " The hideout was in the garage behind the great big house that old Mrs. Westerfield , Rob 's grandmother , lived in all summer . It was always unlocked , and sometimes Andrea and her friends sneaked in there and smoked cigarettes . Andrea had taken Ellie there a couple of times when she was babysitting her . Her friends had been really mad at Andrea for bringing her along , but she had said , " Ellie is a good kid . She 's not a snitch . " Hearing that had made Ellie feel great , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the cigarette . Ellie was sure that last night Andrea had left Joan 's house early because she was planning to meet Rob Westerfield . Ellie had heard her when she talked to him on the phone yesterday , and when she was finished , she was practically crying . " I told Rob I was going to the mixer with Paulie , " she said , " and now he 's really mad at me . " Ellie thought about the conversation as she finished the cornflakes and juice . Daddy was standing at the stove . He was holding a cup of coffee . Mommy was crying again but making almost no sound . Then , for the first time , Daddy seemed to notice her : " Ellie , I think you 'd be better off in school . At lunchtime I 'll take you over . " " Is it all right if I go outside now ? " " Yes . But stay around the house . " Ellie ran for her jacket and was quickly out the door . It was the fifteenth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ underfoot . The sky was heavy with clouds , and she could tell it was going to rain again . Ellie wished they were back in Irvington where they used to live . It was lonesome here . Mrs. Hilmer 's house was the only other one on this road . Daddy had liked living in Irvington , but they 'd moved here , five towns away , because Mommy wanted a bigger house and more property . They found they could afford that if they moved farther up in Westchester , to a town that had n't yet become a suburb of New York City . When Daddy said he missed Irvington , where he 'd grown up and where they 'd lived until two years ago , Mommy would tell him how great the new house was . Then he 'd say that in Irvington we had a million-dollar view of the Hudson River and the Tappan Zee Bridge , and he did n't have to drive five miles for a newspaper or a loaf of bread . There were woods all around their property . The big Westerfield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of the woods . Glancing back at the kitchen window to make sure no one had seen her , Ellie began to dart through the trees . Five minutes later she reached the clearing and ran across the field to where the Westerfield property began . Feeling more and more alone , she raced up the long driveway and darted around the mansion , a small figure lost in the lengthening shadows of the approaching storm . There was a side door to the garage , and that was the one that was unlocked . Even so , it was hard for Ellie to turn the handle . Finally she succeeded and stepped into the gloom of the interior . The garage was big enough to hold four cars , but the only one Mrs. Westerfield left after the summer was the van . Andrea and her friends had brought some old blankets to sit on when they went there . They always sat in the same spot , at the back of the garage behind the van , so that if anyone happened to look in the window , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew that was where Andrea would be hiding if she was here . She did n't know why she felt suddenly afraid , but she did . Now , instead of running , she had to practically drag her feet to make them move toward the back of the garage . But then she saw it  --  the edge of the blanket peeking out from behind the van . Andrea was here ! She and her friends would never have left the blankets out ; when they left , they always folded them and hid them in the cabinet with the cleaning supplies . " Andrea ... " Now she ran , calling softly so that Andrea would n't be scared . She was probably asleep , Ellie decided . Yes , she was . Even though the garage was filled with shadows , Ellie could see Andrea 's long hair trailing out from under the blankets . " Andrea , it 's me . " Ellie sank to her knees beside Andrea and pulled back the blanket covering her face . Andrea had a mask on , a terrible monster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to pull it off , and her fingers went into a broken space in Andrea 's forehead . As she jerked back , she became aware of the pool of Andrea 's blood , soaking through her slacks . Then , from somewhere in the big room , she was sure she heard someone breathing  --  harsh , heavy , sucking-in breaths that broke off in a kind of giggle . Terrified , she tried to get up , but her knees slid in the blood and she fell forward across Andrea 's chest . Her lips grazed something smooth and cold  --  Andrea 's gold locket . Then she managed to scramble to her feet , and she turned and began to run . She did not know she was shrieking until she was almost home , and Ted and Genine Cavanaugh ran into the backyard to see their younger daughter burst out of the woods , her arms outstretched , her little form covered in her sister 's blood .                   @ @
