<p> The itch to win a second world championship has n't completely been scratched , but until it is , Raul Marquez has another passion he 's trying to satisfy . <p> Last weekend , Houston 's former IBF junior middleweight champ completed his first " major " stint behind the microphone as a boxing color commentator . <p> Marquez , after surviving an audition that included the likes of ESPN 's Teddy Atlas and FSN 's Sean O'Grady to become the sidekick to veteran play-by-play man Bob Papa , was in front of the cameras as NBC resumed network boxing telecasts after an 11-year hiatus . <p> Comfortably and with the poise of a veteran , Marquez plied his new trade as hometown hero Ricardo " Rocky " Juarez ran his record to 16-0 with a convincing TKO of Frankie Archuleta in the 10-round main event . <p> Not that Marquez was a wet-behind-the-ears rookie , mind you . He has received rave reviews over the past three years while moonlighting as a color commentator in Spanish on Telemundo and most recently HBO Latino . <p> Even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim Lampley have lauded Marquez for his work on NBC . <p> " There 's always room for improvement , " Marquez said on Friday . " I 'm the first one to criticize myself . I 'm never satisfied . But I 'm looking forward to this show . " <p> The show to which Marquez referred was Saturday 's second installment of the three-pronged NBC experimental series . The bout was staged in Los Angeles and featured Houston 's undefeated lightweight Juan Diaz ( 20-0 , 11 KOs ) in the 10-round main event against Eleazor Contrearas ( 19-2-2 , 8 ) . <p> The third part of the NBC trilogy is scheduled will be in Atlantic City on Saturday , when Nate Campbell ( 23-1 , 21 ) fights Eldemiro " Tiger " Martinez ( 20-2-1 , 9 ) in a junior-lightweight bout . <p> Marquez said plaudits from the likes of Lampley and Merchant helped boost his confidence . Nothing , however , could completely calm his nerves prior to making his debut . <p> " Believe me , I was nervous , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's free TV . It was a big thing for them . They had n't showed boxing in 11 years . I was a part of all that excitement . <p> " Everyone was nervous , the promoter , the NBC people , everyone . But even though it was our first time , I think we did well . " <p> Encouraged by what transpired , Marquez was hard-pressed to answer whether he 'll retire for a second time from boxing to concentrate on his budding new career . <p> " That 's a hard question . It all just depends , " Marquez said , then added : " No . I 'm not going to stop fighting . I 'm still an active fighter . But it 's got to be a fight that benefits me the most financially and what it can do for my career . " <p> In his last fight , Marquez was foiled by a nemesis that has plagued him since he began boxing professionally in 1990 , shortly after returning from the Barcelona Olympics with a bronze medal . <p> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sugar " Shane Mosley in February in Las Vegas , Marquez began bleeding profusely from cuts above both eyes that resulted from accidental head-butts . <p> The fight was stopped in the fourth round with no decision rendered . Marquez , who holds duel citizenship in the United States and Mexico , traveled south of the border in early March and had loads of the scar tissue surgically removed . <p> He is pointing toward a potential fight in either September or October . For now , however , his concentration is on TV commentary . <p> As for NBC , network officials are encouraged about the numbers generated by the first show on May 3 , according to a statement from Main Events Inc . <p> The show " drew good enough ratings to provide hope that boxing will soon become a regular staple on that network , perhaps by this coming fall , " the release said . <p> According to Mike McCarley , a spokesman for NBC Sports , the show got a 1.4 rating and a 4 share in the overnight ratings . <p> " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ event , aside from the really large events on the premium channels , " McCarley said . " It compares favorably to the Showtime and the HBO shows . So it 's probably one of the larger audiences to actually watch a boxing show this year . " <p> Around the ring <p> A 7.5 win - Rocky Juarez continues to press toward a title fight . His victory over Frankie Archuleta came in typical fashion . <p> Juarez started slowly , then methodically plodded toward a sixth-round TKO , improving to 16-0 . En route , he dropped Archuleta in the third round . <p> Juarez said afterward he was pleased with the win but could have done better . <p> " I feel I could have changed the fight earlier . I 'm a patient fighter . I did n't want the fight to go the distance , " he said . " I gave myself a 7.5 ( on a scale of 10 ) . I could have been more aggressive . <p> " I cut him over the right eye . I was hitting him with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <p> Klitschko added - Vitali Klitschko , older brother of fallen WBO heavyweight champ Wladimir Klitschko , has been added to the Lennox Lewis-Kirk Johnson undercard . <p> The opponent has n't been chosen , but Vitali will fight over 10 rounds on the June 21 card to be staged at Staples Center in Los Angeles . <p> Mike Tyson had been sought to participate but did n't sign his contract within the allotted time and was scratched . <p> Klitschko had been pressing for a challenge to WBC heavy champ Lewis , but that proposed bout fell through . Undaunted , Klitschko has obtained what he says is the second-best thing . <p> " The best thing for me is to fight Lennox Lewis . The second-best thing is to fight on one of his cards , " Klitschko said . " I am confident that this will bring me closer to a fight with Lennox . I am sure I will convince the American fans with my performance . " <p> Until two months ago , brother Wladimir had coveted a match with Lewis , too .

He had hoped to face the winner between ex-champ Hasim Rahman and David Tua , but those two fought to a draw in late March . <p> " He 's the IBF champ , and he 's not finding any takers , " Goossen says of Byrd .

One of the two defeats was to Picirillo in April 2002 . <p> Suits still on - For a brief time , it was thought Mike Tyson and promoter Don King were on the verge of dropping their lawsuits against each other , a precursor to the two rejoining forces . <p> Forget it , says Shelly Finkel , Tyson 's manager/adviser . <p> " I know he 's not signing with King . He said he is not signing with King , " Finkel says . <p> Tyson has a long-standing $ 100 million suit against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stole huge chunks of his earnings during a business association that lasted almost a decade . <p> King has countersued for $ 110 million .
