Chapter One On the very day he turned sixty-three , Clarence MacKenzie received the best birthday present in the world . His first grandchild , Clara , was born . " From now on I shall be called Papa Clarence , " he told his family . And that was that . Not only did Clara and Papa Clarence share the same birthday ; they had the same name . Well , almost . They even looked alike . " But someday you 'll have hair , " Papa said with a grin , " and I never will have hair again . " He was right . Papa Clarence had his own room in the house where Clara lived with her mother and father . In the corner , by the window , sat a large , worn rocking chair . " I used to rock your mama in this chair , " he said to Clara as he held her in his lap and told her stories . She loved to hear his stories . " When I was a little boy , " he always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one night so I could eat it after everyone else went to sleep . " " And did you eat it ? " Clara asked him . " No , " Papa Clarence answered . " But I woke up with a big puddle under my pillow ! " Then they rocked and laughed as the chair sang , " Creak-crick , creak-crick . " These two best friends did everything together . Every morning they sat together at the kitchen table and atetheir cereal . " One spoon of sugar for me , and two for you , " Papa Clarence said , winking and dumping an extra spoonful of sugar on Clara 's cereal . Every afternoon they took naps . Clara did n't always sleep , but she could tell by the snores coming from Papa Clarence 's room as she tiptoed past that he did . Every night before bedtime Papa Clarence rocked Clara in the large , worn rocker and told her Bible stories . " When I was a little boy , " he began , " I liked to pretend that I was one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What animal did you pretend to be ? " asked Clara . " A hoofalopalus ! " Papa answered . Then they rocked and laughed as the chair sang , " Creak-crick , creak-crick . " After stories Papa Clarence and Clara knelt by the side of her bed and said their prayers . Papa Clarence always ended his prayer with , " Thank you , God , for Clara . " Clara always ended her prayer with , " Thank you , God , for Papa Clarence . " Then together they said , " Amen . " Every week Papa Clarence and Clara sat together in church . Clara 's mother and Father came , too , but Clara insisted on sitting next to Papa Clarence . He helped Clara Follow the words in the hymnbook . He held her hand when they prayed . And he kept a pocket full of red-and-white peppermints that he would slip to Clara , one by one , when nobody was watching . Papa Clarence loved the snow . And for no other reason than that , Clara loved the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and soft , Clara and Papa Clarence held hands and gazed out the window at the snowflakes as they swirled and twirled in the winter air . Each year Papa Clarence taught Clara something new about the snow . " Anybody can catch snowflakes on their tongue , " Papa Clarence told Clara . " But not everyone knows how to make a snowflake sandwich . " He took four slices of bread and sprinkled them with lots of sugar . They dressed in their boots and coats and gloves and hurried outside into the snow . " Like this , Clara , " Papa Clarence said , handing her two slices of sugared bread . He held his slices of bread with both hands while the snowflakes piled high . Suddenly Papa clapped his two slices of bread shut . Clara did the same . " The secret is in catching just the perfect snowflakes , " Papa Clarence said as he bit into his sandwich . Clara took a bite of hers . " Needs a bit more sugar , " she said . Another time Papa Clarence and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , white blanket of snow . " Wave your arms but not your legs , " he said . Papa helped Clara to her feet , and they looked at the strange shapes in the snow . " Anybody can make a snow angel , " Papa Clarence told Clara . " But not everyone knows how to make a snow chicken . " He took off one of his gloves and laid it at the top of the snow print he had made . Clara did the same . The glove looked like a chicken 's comb . Then Papa pulled two carrots out of his pocket and showed Clara where to place them to look like chickens ' beaks . " The secret is in choosing just the right glove and carrot , " Papa said , smiling proudly at his snow chicken . Clara bent down and rolled several small snowballs . " Snow eggs , " she said , placing them by her snow chicken . Papa laughed . " Good , Clara , good ! " " Cock-a-doodle-do ! " Papa Clarence crowed , flapping his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snow around their snow chickens , crowing and laughing until their sides hurt . Papa rocked Clara in the large , worn rocker and told her stories . " When I was a little boy , " he began , " I jumped off the barn roof with an umbrella to see if I could fly . " " And could you ? " Clara asked him . " No , " he answered . " But I did a nice dive into the haystack ! " And they rocked and they laughed , and the chair sang , " Creak-crick , creak-crick . " One year on their birthday Clara gave her grandfather a striped knit hat . " To keep your head warm when the snows come , " she told him . Papa Clarence grinned and rubbed his bald head . Then he put on the hat and pulled it down until his whole face was covered . " How do I look , Clara ? " he asked in a muffled voice . " Oh , Papa , " she said , laughing . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just enough so he could see and handed Clara a box wrapped with green foil and a red velvet bow . Carefully she unwrapped the box . Tucked inside Clara found a beautiful glass snow globe . She held it up and saw a little church with a tiny steeple and colored-glass windows . Bits of snow glittered in the light . When she shook the globe , the snow swirled and twirled around the little church . " It 's perfect ! " Clara squealed with delight . " Look very closely , " Papa Clarence said . " Who do you see inside the church ? " Clara looked carefully . " I ca n't see in the windows , " she said . " You 'll have to close your eyes to see , " Papa said and winked . " Funny Papa ! I ca n't see with my eyes closed ! " Clara said , laughing . Papa Clarence took the snow globe and held it up to the light . " I taught you how to make a snowflake sandwich . I taught you how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you can see with your eyes . But there are some things you can only see with your heart . Someday you will know . " Clara kept the snow globe on a table next to her bed . She stared at the little church with the tiny steeple and the colored windows and tried to guess who was inside . Every night she shook the globe and watched the flakes swirl and twirl as she drifted to sleep . That winter , when the first snow fell , silent and soft , Papa Clarence put on his new striped hat . Papa Clarence and Clara pulled on their boots and coats and gloves and hurried outside . The two best friends ate snowflake sandwiches and made a whole row of snow chickens . They strutted and crowed and flapped their arms like wings . " Keep trying , Papa Clarence ! " Clara said . " Maybe someday you 'll fly ! " Then one day Papa Clarence woke up with a fever . His breathing sounded wheezy and loud . Clara brought him cold water and held the cup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knelt by her bed and prayed that Papa would get well . But Papa Clarence did not get well . As each day passed , he grew sicker and sicker . One night the ambulance came and took him to the hospital . Clara could not sleep that night . She lay in bed and stared at the snow globe . She prayed an extra prayer . " Please , God , " she whispered . " Let my Papa be okay . " But the next day Papa Clarence died . When Clara 's mother and father told her what had happened , she ran to her room and slammed the door . She threw herself on her bed , curled up under her blanket , and cried and cried . Through her tears she saw the snow globe on the table by her bed . " Papa Clarence was wrong ! " she said , sobbing . " There is nobody in the church . The church is empty ! God did not answer my prayer . God let Papa die . " She took the snow globe and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying her prayers . Clara would not be comforted . She would not allow her father to put an extra spoonful of sugar on her cereal . She refused to take a nap , even when her mother lay down on the bed beside her . She would not let anyone rock her in the large , worn rocker , which did not sing anymore . Clara went to church and sat between her mother and father , but she would not take the red-and-white peppermints they slipped to her when nobody was looking . When everyone else in the church bowed their heads to pray , Clara sat on her hands and stared straight ahead . One morning Clara woke to find the snow falling , silent and soft . Clara watched the snow through her bedroom window and cried . " I miss you so much , Papa Clarence , " she whispered in the quiet . She reached under her pillow and pulled out Papa Clarence 's knit hat , which she had hidden after he died . She rubbed its softness against her cheek and pulled it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from under her bed . She tiptoed down the hall to Papa Clarence 's empty room . Slowly she opened the door and stepped inside . In the corner , by the window , sat the large , worn rocking chair . It seemed like such a long time since she had listened to Papa tell his stories . Still holding the snow globe , Clara climbed into the rocking chair . She shook the globe and watched the snowflakes swirl and twirl around the little church . She rocked back and forth , back and forth . " Creak-crick , creak-crick , " the chair began to sing . Clara remembered Papa Clarence 's stories , about the time he slept with an icicle underneath his pillow and how he jumped off the barn roof with an umbrella to see if he could fly . She tried to imagine what a hoofalopalus might look like . She looked at the snow globe . Bits of snow glittered in the light . She could almost feel the cold flakes kiss her cheek . Clara remembered when Papa Clarence taught her how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the globe swirl and twirl and thought about the snow chickens with the carrot beaks that they made each year . She stared hard at the little church with the tiny steeple , covered with sparkling snow . Then Clara closed her eyes . She remembered how it felt to sit next to Papa Clarence in church and how he helped her follow the words in the hymnbook . She remembered how warm Papa 's hand felt when they prayed , how sweet the red-and-white peppermints tasted that he slipped to her , one by one , when nobody was watching . " You were right , Papa Clarence , " she said , smiling through her tears . " The church is not empty . I ca n't see you with my eyes anymore . But I can see you with my heart . " She slid from the rocker and gently placed the snow globe on the seat . She ran from Papa 's room , leaving the door open behind her . Clara took four slices of bread from the kitchen and sprinkled them with sugar . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in her pockets . She pulled on her boots and her coat and her gloves and hurried outside . Clara caught snowflakes on the bread and ate both sandwiches . She fell backward into the snow and made a snow chicken . Next to it she made another snow chicken for Papa Clarence . She took off her gloves and put one on the head of each snow chicken and carefully added the carrot beaks . Bits of snow glittered in the light , and the flakes swirled and twirled around her . " Anybody can have a grandpa , " Clara whispered . " But not everyone has a grandpa like my Papa Clarence . " That night Clara set the snow globe on the table next to her bed . Then she knelt to say her prayers for the first time since Papa Clarence died . " Thank you , God , for all the things I can see with my eyes , " she began her prayer . " Like snowflake sandwiches and snow chickens and red-and-white peppermints . And thank you , God , for all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Papa Clarence . And you . Amen . " Clara climbed into bed and snuggled under the covers . Her mother and father came and tucked her in . " Tomorrow morning , " she said , " I 'd like an extra spoonful of sugar on my cereal . And do n't forget the peppermints for church . " After Clara 's mother and father left her room , she reached under her pillow and felt the icicle she had placed there . As sleep fell , silent and soft , upon her , Clara dreamed about Papa Clarence jumping off a barn roof with an umbrella to see if he could fly . He did .
