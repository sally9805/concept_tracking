Jose and Julio Rosa say they are just humble Puerto Rican fishermen . But the brothers know how to hook marlin-size political symbolism . Last Thursday , when they heard that 216 of their protesting compatriots were rounded up by U.S. federales for occupying the Navy bombing range on the small Puerto Rican island of Vieques , the brothers Rosa jumped into their 38-ft. lobster boat  --  aptly named Garata , or Quarrel . The two men , each in his 40s , headed for a Navy installation on mainland Puerto Rico . Their mission : to pick up the detained demonstrators who had been removed from Vieques after their arrest . The Rosas wanted to ferry them back to Vieques in proper triumph . <P> A few miles out , as they tied Puerto Rican flags to the bow and played cat and mouse with Coast Guard ships patrolling the channel , the Rosas saw more than 15 other Vieques fishing boats slicing through the translucent blue water to join them . " This is the Borinquen I want to see , " said Jose , using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learning to stand up for ourselves , for once . " <P> Last week , for the second time in 13 days , Washington was forced into a standoff on America 's tropical fringe . But while the Elian raid has torn Miami asunder , the Vieques episode could help Puerto Rico unify . For the past century , the island has been a U.S. commonwealth  --  a hybrid that gives its 4 million people many of the benefits of Yankee citizenship , such as U.S. military protection , but without the full burdens of citizenship , such as federal income taxes . It has also left them with a murky political identity , fractured among those who want independence , statehood or the status quo . Vieques , and the crusade to halt the bombing there , " marks the first time Puerto Ricans have formed a consensus on anything , " says demonstrator Jose Antonio Rivera , 51 , a music teacher . Puerto Rico 's status wo n't change anytime soon , and the standoff was in many ways a radical-chic stunt by Puerto Rico 's small pro-independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rico wants to speak more of its own mind . <P> Since the time of the Korean War , Vieques , an island of some 9,500 inhabitants , has been a prized military range . Recent studies , though , show that the bombing has hurled haunting levels of toxins into Vieques ' air , water and fishing grounds  --  which some believe is why the cay has a 27% higher cancer rate than the main island . And because Vieques has some of the Caribbean 's most exquisite beaches , locals complain that the Navy exercises have blighted tourism . Julio Rosa 's sister Carmen , lost a breast to cancer a decade ago . ( She lived a few miles downwind from the explosions . ) He looks out from the helm of the Garata and says simply , " We have real-life issues here . "
