Headnote Europeans ignore their increasing Islamicization and turn against America at their peril . // THE QUESTION THAT ANIMATES THIS ESSAY IS one that troubles not only Americans , hut the friends of freedom and democracy everywhere . Why , when the rewards of liberty have been so amply demonstrated to the peoples of Europe over the course of the 20th century , have they turned with such vehemence against the nation that rescued , restored , and is now again reinforcing those liberties ? Americans and Europeans may inhabit different continents , but they surely do not inhabit different planets . What is commonly called the West still identifies a coherent conception of what a civilization is , or at least ought to be . And in the defense of that civilization , Europeans are doomed by history and geography to occupy the front line . Just as Imperial and Nazi Germany dominated the mainland of Europe hut never directly impinged on America , just as the Soviet Union occupied almost half of Europe but in the Western hemisphere never advanced beyond Cuba , so today the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Americans . Yet the war on terror is viewed with a jaundiced eye from the opposite shore of the Atlantic : For many Europeans , it is America 's war , not Europe 's , if it is a war at all . The most influential analysis of this transatlantic divergence has been that of Robert Kagan . As an American living in Brussels , he has been uniquely well placed to observe the workings of the European Union from within , while retaining the critical perspective of an outsider . His treatise Of Paradise and Power crystallized the rival perspectives into a series of neat contrasts : Kant versus Hobbes , peace versus war , multilateralism versus unilateralism , " soft " versus " hard " power . More recently , Kagan has filled out this aphoristic outline with Dangerous Nation , a closely argued and erudite narrative history of " America 's place in the world " from the origins of the republic to the early 20th century . Kagan 's argument in Dangerous Nation neatly dovetails with Of Paradise and Power by demonstrating that American readiness to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but " reflected Americans " view of themselves as the advance guard of civilization , leading the way against backward and barbaric nations and empires . " America 's martial idealism is rooted in the republic 's founding vision of liberty under the law , was tested almost to destruction in the Civil War , and achieved full expression only in the global conflicts of the 20th century . No other nation has so liberally sacrificed its blood and treasure for the sake of liberty ; no other nation could have matched such sublime words with such substantial deeds . Humanity in general , and Europe in particular , owes the United States a debt of honor that is unprecedented in history . It is a debt , however , that remains outstanding , at least as far as most of continental Europe is concerned . With notable exceptions among the " accession " countries of central and Eastern Europe , the only continental states to offer support to the United States in Iraq were Spain and Italy . In both cases , however , the right-of-center governments that took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from office-notoriously , in the case of Spain , under the impact of the terrorist attack on Madrid . While it is true that the volume of anti-American rhetoric has recently been turned down in France , largely thanks to the Gaullist presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy , and even more so in Germany , thanks to the chancellor , Angela Merkel , the record of these two leading nations of the European Union inspires little confidence that a real change of heart is in the offing . For all intents and purposes , Europe has ceased to be a reliable ally of the United States . The continent has instead reverted to a complex patchwork of attitudes and allegiances such as existed before the Cold War . with the emergence of Islam as a major political factor serving to polarize opinion for and-mainly-against America . IT IS ILLUMINATING TO COMPARE the reactions of Europeans to previous existential threats with the new threat posed by radical Islam . A fundamental difference between Europe 's predicament today and those of the past is the absence of the unifying set of Judeo-Christian beliefs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Augustine of Hippo , Christians believed that the city of God was both stronger and incomparably more precious than the cities of men . and that pagan invasions were merely a means of divine chastisement : " Thus , in this universal catastrophe , the sufferings of Christians have tended to their moral improvement , because they viewed them with the eyes of faith . " The collapse of the Roman Empire in the West was not the end of civilization . On the contrary , the successive waves of barbarian peoples evoked a new kind of civilization , more robust than the ancient polis . Christendom , though never confined to Europe , was constitutive of Europe . When Europe began to deconstruct its Judeo-Christian inheritance , it tore up its roots . Europe forgot the truth about its own origins : that the salvation of Western civilization was made possible by the powers of endurance of Christianity , which in turn owed everything to the miraculous survival of the Jews . The progressive secularization of Europe , driven by what the Jewish scholar Joseph Weiler has called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the West to the very dangers against which the Judeo-Christian ethic of spiritual resilience in the face of temporal disaster had for so long protected it . Nor will the invocation of the Enlightenment as an alternative source of inspiration be sufficient . Like the Renaissance culture from which it emerged , the Enlightenment too was indebted to the Judeo-Christian traditions that had preserved the civilization of the West in its darkest hours . If the experience of the totalitarian pseudo-religions of the last century should have taught Europeans anything , it is that in the absence of the active defense of the JudeoChristian conception of the moral integrity of the human person , the more utilitarian values of the Enlightenment alone can not be relied upon to prevent a descent into unspeakable depravity . In the medieval and early modern eras , Europe was able to resist external threats-primarily from Islam-by drawing on a warrior ethos , a conscious effort to cultivate martial virtues , that lasted well into the 20th century . That ethos is well summed up by G.K. Chesterton in his stirring poem Lepanto , which recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the poem is that while the crowned heads of Europe ignore the impending Turkish onslaught , the old spirit of chivalry that had animated the Crusades is not yet dead . " The last knight of Europe takes weapons from the wall . " As the battle reaches its climax , Chesterton evokes the plight of the godforsaken Christian slaves who rowud the Turkish galleys : " Breaking of the hatches up and bursting of the holds , /Thronging of the thousands up that labor under sea/ White for bliss and blind for sun and stunned for liberty . " The point is that Europe , to survive , must connect the love of liberty with the courage to defend it . Yet that courage is precisely what seems now to be lacking . The moral code under which Western Europe has operated since 1945 puts safety first , second , and third . Bravery is equated with bellicosity , chivalry with chauvinism , heroism with celebrity . Europe contemplates American feats of arms with barely disguised distaste . The bombing of Baghdad in 2003 was intended to induce shock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European allies no less than its enemies . In Germany the refrain was : " Have n't the Americans and British learned anything since Dresden ? " The critics ignored the precision of the attack , which reduced civilian casualties to a minute fraction of those inflicted in comparable raids during the second World War or even Vietnam . The objection was less to the destructiveness of the military technology than to the " gung-ho " enthusiasm of the men and women who fought what proved to he a tenacious and incredibly bloodthirsty foe . The mentality of the warrior , still considered worthy of respect in popular American culture , is regarded in Europe as undisguised fascism . AND YET ALL AROUND us the generations that defeated the Kaiser and Hitler are quietly slipping away , their astonishing deeds disregarded , their decorations treated as mere curiosities . The heroes themselves refer to their exploits rarely , and when they do speak of them it is in a matter-offact way that belies the unimaginable circumstances in which they saved civilization from tearing itself apart . Day by day their obituaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of famous victories now fallen silent . One of those who fought on the wrong side in both world wars was Ernst Jiinger , who wrote a classic account of trench warfare-he was wounded 14 times-Storm of Steel . Describing the last great German offensive in March 1918 , he describes the mood on the eve of battle : " I sensed the weight of the hour , and I think everyone felt the individual in them dissolve , and fear depart . " The dissolution of the individual in war is a fact that frightens Europeans today . For the soldier , however , it is precisely that selflessness that banishes fear . Nor does the collectivism of conflict necessarily mean that mercy is denied to individual enemies . He recalls an encounter with a wounded British officer in the same battle . Holding a pistol to his victim 's head , Junger fully intended to shoot him . But : " With a plaintive sound , he reached into his pocket , not to pull out a weapon , hut a photograph which he held up to me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all standing on a terrace . It was a plea from another world . Later , I thought it was blind chance that I let him go and plunged onward . That one man of all often appeared in my dreams . I hope that meant he got to see his homeland again . " It was not blind chance that made him spare his enemy , hut the instinctive humanity that made Junger untypical of the Nazi-led Wehrmacht he would nonetheless serve under two decades later . It is this magnanimity that still separates the West from the Islamic terrorists . WHAT IS IT THAT has rendered Europeans so unwilling to rouse themselves in the defense of liberty that Americans so naturally regard as their vocation from God ? Consider two examples of martial virtue that are almost commonplace in the United Status . A former instructor at West Point , Col. Blair Tiger , told me about the case of a female officer who had lost a leg in Iraq . Though invalided out of the Army , she missed active service , and after an interval she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for duty . Colonel Tiger watched this woman attempt the extremely arduous assault course designed for able-bodied recruits . When she encountered a wall and was required to jump up to a high ledge , he fully expected her to give up . Not a bit of it : Nonchalantly unstrapping her artificial leg , she threw it up onto the ledge , and then with a supreme effort succeeded in hopping up . She climbed down on the other side , put her peg-leg back on , and carried on . Another example : When steel from the wreckage of the World Trade Center was melted down and used to construct the anti-terrorist assault ship USS New York , everyone involved-from steel workers at the foundry to the naval officers manning the warshipsensed the " spiritual " significance of this unique act of recycling . It is not easy to imagine such scenes taking place in continental Europe . Most Europeans are no longer ready to lay down their lives for their fellow countrymen-or indeed for any other cause . True , we have been here before . In 1933 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Oxford Union , a debating society for the future British political elite , passed a notorious motion : " That this House would under no circumstances fight for its King and country . " Hitler apparently took this as evidence that the British would never fight another war with Germany . Once the policy of appeasement was seen to have failed , however , the British did fight-unlike most of continental Europe . So , though we are undoubtedly living in a period of pacifism or even defeatism , the mood could change abruptly . This time , however , it is not true that-as a famous Victorian song had it- " We do n't want to fight , but , by jingo if we do , / We 've got the ships , we 've got the men , we 've got the money too . " Europe has neither ships , nor men , nor moneyor at least it is not prepared to spend money on war , least of all against Islamist terror . Why not ? The rot set in during the Cold War , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picked up the tab for its own military expenditure . For more than half a century , the United States has subsidized the " European pillar " of NATO . Indeed , NATO eventually came to be seen by cynical Europeans as a thinly disguised mechanism for extracting something for nothing from Uncle Sam . But now that the habits and virtues of martial fortitude that sustain peoples through long periods of conflict have decayed in Europe , it is apparent that the Americans had the better of the deal in the long run . For those European states that possessed colonies , the Cold War coincided with decolonization . There can be no doubt that this process of imperial disenchantment lies at the heart of Europe 's selfabsorption . The loss was moral as much as territorial . Europe disencumbered itself of a burden , but the continent also lost much of its own raison d ' ' tre . The loss of empire mattered less in itself than as an abandonment of the peoples of Africa . Asia , Latin America , and Oceania to what often proved a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ responsibility for regions with which it had no historical connection , such as Southeast Asia , Europe abandoned its new creations with indecent haste . Most of the 50 million or more people who have died in wars since 1945 were the victims of Europe 's abdication of its responsibility towards its former colonies . The damage inflicted on the European psyche by this loss of nerve , this failure of moral imagination , is incalculable . IT WAS DURING THE SPANISH-AMERICAN WAR , the first humanitarian intervention by the newly self-confident United States , that Rudyard Kipling addressed one of his most politically incorrect poems to the American people . Today " The White Man 's Burden " offends because of its racial overtones , but it is not really about race so much as responsibility . To the refrain " Take up the White Man 's burden , " the poet warns of the trials that lie ahead for Britain 's American cousins ; " The savage wars of peace/Fill full the mouth of Famine/And bid the sickness ceuse ; /And when your goal is nearest/The end for others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to nought . " Kipling evokes " The cry of hosts ye humour/ ( Ah , slowly ! ) toward the light : /'Why brought ye us from bondage. /Our loved Egyptian night ? ' ' " Even more prophetic is another passage : " In patience to abide , /To veil the threat of terror/And check the show of pride ... " Kipling was well aware , too , that taking responsibility for another people invites the harshest of criticism at home : " Comes now . to search your manhood/Through all the thankless years , /Cold , edged with dear-bought wisdom , /The judgment of your peers ! " President Bush could echo Kipling in the inner recesses of his heart-any less privately and he would never be forgiven-but of his European peers only Tony Blair would understand . The rest know little and care less about bringing freedom and democracy to benighted nations . What was once the European burden has become primarily an American one . And though Mr. Bush may wish that he had heeded Kipling 's warning- " Nor call too loud on Freedom/To cloak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is to have shown too great a zeal for liberty . The European refusal , not only to assist in the overthrow of a tyrant but to give a fledgling democracy all possible assistance , is a measure of its decline . I once had an exchange with the German foreign minister Joschka Fischer at an embassy lunch about his country 's failure to help Iraq to get back on its feet . Fischer protested too much , and his evident irritation betrayed the had conscience of a postwar German who knew full well that his own people had not so lung ago been rescued from a similarly desperate plight by the Yanks and the Brits . The flight from faith and the ability to endure suffering ; the revulsion from war and the virtues of the warrior ; the abdication of responsibility that was once the concomitant of imperialism : These are all crucial factors in the transformation of the Old World 's relationship with the New . Europe , the homeland of Western civilization , has mutated from a self-confident concert of powers , comfortable in the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent of querulous , carping prima donnas , quick to criticize anything and everything about the United States but unwilling to make sacrifices for anything beyond their own narrow horizons . It is easy to forget how recent this transformation is . The revolutions of 1989 promised to bring " Eastern Europe " -a misnomer for lands that had once been wholly Western-back to life . The 1990s began with high hopes : the incubus of Communism banished , broken nations and lives healed , with both halves of the continent stimulated by the challenges ahead . Today , less than 20 years after this European epiphany , those hopes have turned to dust . The expansion of NATO and the EU can not disguise the fact that these Cold War institutions have been hollowed out , and no longer embody any meaningful ideas . To adapt Dean Acheson 's famous aphorism about Great Britain : The European Union has acquired an empire and lost its role . WHAT IS GNAWING at the heart of Europe , rather , are two impending crises : demographic decline and the creeping Islamicization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or not he was the first to make the connection between demography and Islam , Mark Steyn has led the charge . America Alone makes the case that Europe faces a future of accelerating depopulation-unless mass immigration by rapidly reproducing Muslims fills the vacuum . His argument is that " Eutopia " - the pacific , welfare-cosseted , multicultural , green and pleasant land that the EU aspires to be-is on a collision course with " Eurabia " - the new generation of hostile , proselytizing , violent Muslim youths hunt on turning their adoptive continent into a kind of Gaza strip writ large . For Steyn , a new Dark Ages beckons . Yet the old adage " demography is destiny " is at best a half-truth . It was the pioneer of demography , the Reverend Thomas Malthus , who gained economics its reputation as the " dismal science " and his prediction that industrialization would produce famine turned out to be wrong . By implication , Steyn acknowledges that the transformation of Europe into Eurabia is not inevitable-otherwise , why bother to polemicize against it ? That America really is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ halt the march of Islamofascism , on the other hand , seems to me indisputable . So the question then becomes : How can Europe be mobilized to defend itself ? Why , if the diagnosis is so obvious , is the remedy still so unpalatable ? ONE WAY OF LOOKING AT THIS is to identify those who are hindering the recognition of reality and then to tackle them . By far the most powerful obstacle remains the left , which still holds power in most European countries most of the time , and which usually sabotages any conservative leader who tries to break the consensus . Just as the left-with many honorable exceptions-advocated appeasement of Communism , so today they are busily accommodating themselves to the Islamists . In some cases , such as George Galloway 's grotesque Respect Party in Britain , the alliance is overt . More often , though , it is more of a hard cop , soft cop routine . Aggressive secularization , expunging Christian morality from the law and excluding Christian voices from the public square , goes hand-in-hand with an informal acceptance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a similar acceptance of Muslim antiSemitism . A central tenet of the 21st-century left , too , is anti-Americanism . When in January . Tony Blair welcomed Condoleezza Rice to Downing Street , Peter Hain , a senior member of his cabinet , chose that day to denounce " the most right-wing American administration , if not ever , then in living memory " and declared that " the neo-con mission has failed . " These and similar sentiments have become an article of faith for most of the European left , and even for conservatives who wish to curry favor with the liberal media . Yet the left is not monolithic , and there are dissenters . In Britain , Tony Blair is loathed by the left and now finds himself closer to neoconservatives on both sides of the Atlantic ; yet the Euston Manifesto in 2006 brought together a group of left-wing intellectuals who support his stand against the jihad . They are joined by a growing number of writers and academics for whom the censorship , misogyny , and illiberalism associated with Islam are the main issues . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home precisely because they can not be dismissed LLS " right-wing . " The betrayal of intellectual freedom by the European intelligentsia is nothing new . This time , however , the trahison des clercs , as Julien Benda called it . is even more blatantly against the interests of the intellectuals as a class than it was in the case of fascism or Communism . Islam , even in its more moderate form , has no place for the libertarian and libertine values that predominate in what they see as the decadent culture of the West . It is too late to do anything about the likes of Gnter Grass and Gore Vidal , Noam Chomsky , and Eric Hobsbawm . But younger intellectuals who do not wish to be re-educated in Mecca should be able to make common cause with conservatives on the issue of freedom of speech and the press . The second major stumbling block for those who are serious about stopping Europe 's slide into oriental despotism is the new Muslim establishment . Once marginal , Islam is now the fastest growing religion across Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and mosques , schools , and other Islamic institutions have acquired power and influence to match . In many cases , however , they have simultaneously been radicalized . Funded largely by Saudi and other Middle Eastern oil money , Wahhabi influence is growing fast . The vast majority of British Muslims are not Middle Eastern in origin ; most belong to the Sufi tradition , which is relatively tolerant . But many-probably most-British mosques are now under the control of community " leaders " who are radically opposed to the war on terror and whose loyalty to the Muslim " ummah " takes precedence over their allegiance to the Crown . It is hard to measure the precise extent of Wahhahi and other extremist influence , but a fairly reliable indicator is the attitude toward women : If they are excluded from the mosque , or segregated in a separate prayer room , it is likely to be hard-line . More than half of British mosques do in fact exclude women , and it is a similar story across Europe . We can see the results of this radicalization wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A terrorist suspect who had been subject to a " control order , " restricting his movements and requiring him to report to the police everyday , absconded and look sanctuary in his local mosque . The British authorities did not dare to arrest him in the mosque , so began protracted negotiations . While these were going on , the terror suspect was given a new passport and smuggled out of the country , probably to an al Qaeda training camp in Pakistan . Another case : An undercover reporter for the Channel Four documentary " Dispatches " filmed a radical preacher denouncing Western democracy before the council of a large mosque in Birmingham . Their only comment was : " When can you start ? " The same program uncovered similar evidence of Wahhabi influence on the oldest and most prestigious mosque in Britain : the London Central Mosque in Regent 's Park . Of course , it is not a one-way street : Finsbury Park Mosque , where the Islamofascist preacher Abu Hamza radicalized many young men who later became terrorists , is now under the control of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first hand the terrible consequences of Islamist sectarianism in his native country-told me exactly how the extremists had been systematically excluded . But these are rare exceptions . What is to be done ? Short of closing down at least half the mosques and subjecting the rest to close scrutiny , there is no simple solution . Moreover , such doctrinal invigilation would run contrary to the great tradition of religious toleration that goes back to Locke and Spinoza . Like Elizabeth I , we do not wish to make windows into men 's souls ; and like the American Founding Fathers , we do not wish to impose religious tests for public office . Yet radical Islam is as much a political ideology as it is a religion , and Americans have never hesitated to ban members of subversive political parties , whether Nazi or Communist , from entering the country . Perhaps the best rule of thumb is to follow the money , which is the root of all evil , including Islumofascism . The criterion for toleration should be that identified by Pope Benedict XVI : that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jewish , or other nonMuslim worship should be allowed to flood the West with money to fund mosques that promote Wahhabi or other extremist forms of Islam . For example , the British obviously should not let Tablighi Jamaat , a missionary organization that intelligence experts suspect is a front for terrorism , to build the largest mosque in Europe in the East End of London , next to the site of the 2012 Olympic village . Saudi Arabia is not footing the bill purely for altruistic reasons , any more than the rest of the hundreds of billions of dollars that it has dispensed to promote Wahhabi Islam worldwide . CONTROLLING THE CASH SUPPLY may not be sufficient , however . In the view of many , what is needed is an Islamic reformation . Quite apart from the fact that the Christian Reformation was followed by a century of wars of religion , the possibility of Islam actually undergoing such a reformation seems remote . As Pope Benedict has observed , the Koran can not be reinterpreted because it is supposed to be not merely inspired by Allah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As the Pope correctly argued in his Regensburg address , Allah , unlike the Judeo-Christian God , is not logocentric ; to be a Muslim means to submit to the will of Allah , not presuming to understand the reason why . Sharia is divine and hence immutable : theocracy is preferred to democracy . The central role of jihad in Islam is not about to change , either . It is this doctrinal rigidity that causes many European Muslims to believe that America is attacking Islam , even though the truth is just the reverse . A religion that emerged in seventh-century Arabia must evolve and adapt if it is to be compatible with the Anglo-Saxon idea of liberty under man-made law on which the United States is based . The best hope for Islam is not reformation but integration . While the theology of Islam is unlikely to be reformed any time soon , there is no reason why Muslims should not adapt to Europe , just as they have been adapting to various other cultures for 14 centuries . This was the dream offered by the founder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proudest boast was that he was a member of the Athenaeum , a club traditionally frequented by Anglican bishops . But when Badawi died last year aged 84 , his dream of a fully integrated British Islam was still unfulfilled . Instead , a very different dream inspires many young European Muslims : the dream of an Islamic republic under a restored caliphate . Combined with an aggrieved sense of victimhood and a perverted cult of martyrdom , this vision of a purer , universal faith becomes an unstable , volatile , and literally explosive fantasy . The young male fantasists who become Islamist jihadis attempt to live this dream . It has become Europe 's nightmare . In somu places , that nightmare is already reality . Europe is now in the early stages of a Kulturkampf , a cultural confrontation between unreformed Islam and the modern nation-state . Europe has internalized the clash of civilizations . There is potential here for a civil war that could tear Europe apart . Memories of Yugoslavia and Chechnya are still fresh . Yet the American example could still teach Europe how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must he replaced by the meltingpot , which inculcates American values while respecting religious differences . THAT , OF COURSE , IS NOT ALL that Europe has to learn from America . Where the United States is democratic , the European Union is bureaucratic ; where American capitalism is dynamic , European capitalism is static ; where Americans are hopeful , convinced that they can solve all the problems of the world by their own efforts , Europeans are fatalistic , helplessly and hopelessly expecting the worst . Europe does n't have to be that way . ( Russia is another story . ) If it is to preserve its place as the heartland of Western civilization , Europe has no choice hut to follow America 's lead . America 's hopes and fears are-or should be-Europe 's , too . In Bosnia , Kosovo , and Afghanistan , this fact of life was eventually acknowledged , grudgingly and belatedly : not so in the case of Iraq . Europe is about to be tested again . When Iran supplies terrorists in Iraq to kill American or British troops , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Europe 's reflexive response is to send diplomatic missions to discover what the Iranians " really " want . What , though , if the Iranian tyrant simply means what he says-defeat for the United States and destruction for Israel ? Is Europe to stand idly by while Ahmadinejad carries on where Hitler left off ? The most ignominious chapter in Europe 's long history has been deliberately and indelibly imprinted on the collective memory of its peoplesbut for what purpose , if not to prevent a repetition of the Nazi genocide ? Iran , then , will be the supreme test of European resolve . If the pusillanimous politicians who strut the corridors of the chancelleries of Europe can not bring themselves to act before it is too late-if , in short , they do not support President Bush when the moment comes to halt the Iranian IslamoNazis in their tracks , then Europeans will have proved themselves unworthy of their ancestors at Thermopylae and Marathon . Five centuries ago , Martin Luther wrote in his treatise Secular Authority : " Frogs need storks . " The Islamist storks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The question for Europeans is : Are they men or frogs ?
