/Jan 2004 Seattle may be the best-known center of contemporary glassmaking in the United States , but Millville , NJ , has the distinction of having the oldest continuous tradition of glassmaking in this country : the first glasshouse was established there in 1806 and three factories continue to operate . Wheaton Village was founded in Millville in 1968 to preserve and celebrate this glass legacy . At the heart of the village is the Glass Studio in the T. C. Wheaton Glass Factory , modeled on the factory founded in 1888 . Featuring an amphitheater/hot glass workshop and sophisticated casting facilities , the factory replica was built in 1970 by Frank Wheaton Jr . in honor of his grandfather . The shady 50-acre Wheaton Village complex contains galleries , craft studios such as pottery and wood carving for demonstrations to visitors , the Down Jersey Folklife Center and the Museum of American Glass , which houses a comprehensive collection of historical American-made glass and is building an impressive array of contemporary glass .

Their idea was to see how artists might benefit from extended time working at the facilities and receiving technical support . The 20th anniversary of this program was marked this year on July 11-13 during GlassWeekend , a biennial gathering of artists , collectors , galleries and curators under the auspices of the Art Alliance for Contemporary Glass and Wheaton Village . The primary mission of the alliance , which was founded in 1987 , is education . A typical GlassWeekend offers symposia , demonstrations by top artists ( this year Richard Jolley , Dante Marioni and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in glass . Total attendance this year was 362 . Since the start of the fellowship program , 234 resident artists from around the world have worked at Wheaton . Much of their activity takes place in public view . Visitors may wander the village on most days and can watch a veritable three-ring circus on the hot-shop floor . At designated times a narrator will explain the finer points of glassmaking via closed-circuit television . Resident fellows ' demonstrations are often experimental rather than rehearsed , thus all the more exciting to watch . Activities in cast glass are equally extensive but less public , because of the location of the kilns . This year the Museum of American Glass is presenting the exhibition " 20/20 Vision , " June 1 , 2003-January 4 , comprising 103 works by 105 former and current fellows , which the curator , Susanne K. Frantz , describes as a " snapshot of trends over the past 20 years . " Interviewed at GlassWeekend , Frantz shares some of her views about the exhibition and the field . Has the CGCA fellowship program produced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tangible object that emerges from a residence . The beauty of the CGCA is the opportunity for an artist to work , fora limited period of time , on whatever he or she wishes to develop . Even more valuable is the CGCA 's particular interest in mid-career artists . The transition period from the security and tolerance of a school setting to the crushing reality of survival is critical . Most opportunities are aimed at emerging or more established artists . While those artists are certainly included in the CGCA " s mission , the particular consideration given to professionals who fall " in-between " makes the institution unique . Not necessarily referring to specific works in the show , what trends strike you as most significant for the future of glass ? I do n't think that it is possible to make stylistic predictions about the future of glass or any other medium . Glass has always mirrored trends in all of the visual arts , and it still does . I can point out a few changes that seem significant to me . The field is huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Glassblowing is no longer the predominant technique , and the United States is not the main game in town . There were an astonishing 31 countries represented at the annual Glass Art Society conference last June . American glass seems less territorial to me-artists , architects , designers and craftspersons are moving more freely between their disciplines , as they have traditionally in other countries . The individuals who molded the first few generations of studio glass are retiring , and I believe there has been a progressive shift in educational philosophy . The hefty appetites but fairly conservative tastes of many glass galleries and collectors , combined with the ever-increasing pressure on museums to attract growing numbers of visitors and gifts , have led to a homogenization of exhibiting and collections ( both public and private ) . That trend , unfortunately , shows no sign of letting up . Do you notice obvious differences between American glass and that of other countries ? To be honest , I do n't . The bulk of American glass made to be considered as art is highly commercial and tailored to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , is neither unique to this country , nor to the medium . It is true worldwide . I do n't believe that national styles exist in the glass field anymore-that is , not among the work that I find of most interest . In the past you could often pick out the Czech , Japanese or Australian pieces , on the basis of aesthetic or technical similarities . That has not been the case for at least a good 10 years . On the other hand ( and bizarre as it sounds ) , I suppose one could say that a good deal of the most remarkable " Italian-style " glass is now made by non-Italians . In your catalog essay for " 20/20 Vision " you stated that you hope CGCA will " challenge itself and the field even further . " What do you have in mind ? I understand that Wheaton has now engaged a creative director , Hank Murta Adams . I believe that the CGCA will benefit greatly from the educated perspective of a person who looks beyond the surface of the glass scene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ risk-taking , and my impression is that he is not afraid of controversy . Hank has a sense of contemporary art-not just contemporary glass-and he can see what is genuinely innovative and what is not . Also , rather than just waiting for people to apply , I hope that he will recruit artists who will most benefit from the Fellows program . He can also encourage the cooperative relationship between the CGCA and the educational programs of other institutions . Today the most visible face of the international glass world is sleek and self-satisfied . There is no argument that artists must be able to earn a living , andyes , we are all comforted by gifts and lovely decoration , but I believe that the glass world would benefit from greater visionary and ( do I have the nerve to say it ? ) idealistic thinking . The CGCA can be a powerful advocate for the position that an is special , not just a meal ticket , and that the medium of glass can have a more noble purpose than to fill an expensive marketing niche . - ROBIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjunct assistant professor at the University of the Arts , Philadelphia . // <p>
