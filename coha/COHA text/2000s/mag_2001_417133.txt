A Tragic Journey Dancing through the streets of Dangriga , Belize , college students reenact the arrival of their Garifuna ancestors , who began trickling into Belize from Honduras around 1802 . The Garifuna journey to Central America had begun long before-and was far from joyous . Herded aboard slave ships in West Africa , a group of Garifuna forebears were likely destined for New World mines and plantations when they wrecked off St. Vincent in 1635 . They found refuge with the island 's Carib Indians , immigrants from South America . The two peoples blended through marriage , creating the Garifuna culture-Caribbean fishing and farming traditions with a mixture of South American and African music , dance , and spirituality . The Garifuna prospered and coexisted peacefully with French settlers who came later in the 17th century . Tensions arose when English colonists began to arrive and demand land . Those tensions eventually turned to war . Hopelessly outnumbered by British troops , the Garifuna and their French supporters surrendered in 1796 . The victors exiled the Garifuna to the island of Baliceaux . Imprisoned there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following year survivors were shipped to Roatan Island off the coast of Honduras . According to legend , the Garifuna hid cassava , a mainstay of their diet , inside their clothes , where it stayed alive watered by the sweat of the tightly packed captives . They planted the cassava on Roatan , where it grew abundantly . Soon the Garifuna established fishing villages in Honduras , Nicaragua , Guatemala , and Belize . Each year in Belize , when locals reenact the arrival in that land , they slip out to sea in boats , then ride the surf onto shore , waving palm fronds and banana leaves to symbolize the case sava that sustained their ancestors . This ritual , rich in music and dance , helps sustain Garifuna culture . An Enduring Way of Life Wooden dories rest on the shore of a lagoon in Nueva Armenia on the Honduran coast , where most of the Garifuna have settled . The sea still serves as a byway , grocery , laundry , workplace , and playground for the Garifuna people , much as it has for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ timeless rhythms of daily life . Fishermen rise before daybreak to head out to sea . Women work farms , raise the children , and prepare meals of fresh fish and cassava , plantains , pineapples , and coconuts plucked from village trees . Children help with family chores , scrubbing dirty clothes and cleaning fish hauled in by their fathers ( upper right ) . This subsistence lifestyle , as well as physical isolation , has helped reinforce the Garifuna 's cultural independence . In recent years , however , there has been an accelerated shift toward a wage economy , according to Roy Cayetano , president of the National Garifuna Council in Belize . " We are not as selfsufficient as we used to be , " he says . Many people have moved to larger cities and even to the United States in search of jobs , " seduced into working for wages . " In Nueva Armenia , Jose Vuelto Batis ( above ) has found a balance between the old way of life and the new . At midday he waits on the sandbar for fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not needed for village families , then sells the fish to restaurants in La Ceiba , a nearby city of some 150,000 people . This business as a seafood middleman allows him to make a living and support his family while continuing to live in the village he loves  --  a rare straddling of two very different worlds . Conflict and Continuity Drumbeats for change first fell on deaf ears as Garifuna protesters met police near a government building in Tegucigalpa , Honduras . This face-off occurred when hundreds of Garifuna from around Honduras traveled to the capital city to protest a law that would make some of the Garifuna 's coastal land vulnerable to tourist development . The protest felt more like a party as people danced , sang , and beat their drums , but the message was solemn . " The land is like your mother . You do n't sell her , nor do you rent her . In her we are born , and toward her we are returned at the end of our existence . " These words came from a video shown by Celeo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largest Garifuna organizations in Central America . " The culture is at risk if the people lose their land , " he says . The Honduran government has agreed to reconsider land sales that would affect Garifuna villages . In Belize protecting language is also a primary goal . " We are beginning to make demands ... that our spirit , our language , our history must be taught in our schools , " says National Garifuna Council president Cayetano . " We have a reason to celebrate , " he adds . " We are the children of survivors . " Sacred Heart Elementary in Dangriga ( lower left ) has taken up this cause . And at nearby Sacred Heart Catholic Church women display the brilliant colors and patterns of traditional Garifuna dress on holidays ( above ) . But the quest to maintain culture seems to hang by a scarlet thread . " I think we 're at a turning point , " says Clement Flores , who returned to Dangriga after living in the U.S. " It 's so easy to live by somebody else 's standard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a sense of duty women from one extended family wade out to meet returning fishing boats as part of a ritual called the dugu-the most sacred ceremony of the Garifuna religion . When a family experiences persistent problems , the spirits of their dead ancestors request a dugu to reestablish spiritual , physical , and social harmony . All relatives must attend , whether they live on a tiny Honduran island ( right ) or in New York City . At this dugu in Barranco , a remote village in southern Belize , family members also came from Guatemala , Honduras , and the U.S. After three days of fishing the boats return , and the family marches to a temple for two days of drumming and singing . During a dance called the mali , dancers believe they can summon healing by capturing the spirits of their ancestors . If the ancestors are appeased , the family will heal . This ritual brings family members together , strengthening the bonds that unite the Garifuna . Sidebar <p>            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
