<p> ACCORDING to Ann Brashares ' publishers , her first novel , The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants , sold more than 350,000 copies in hardcover . <p> When I reviewed it in this column two years ago , I counted myself among its many enthusiasts , most of whom , I suspect , were female . In The Sisterhood , Brashares follows the adventures of four teenage friends - Lena , Tibby , Carmen and Bridget - as they spend their first summer apart from each other . The pants of the title are a pair of jeans that pass from torso to torso through the summer and on which the girls inscribe memories of a truly memorable season . <p> I had no idea that a sequel was in the works until The Second Summer of the Sisterhood ( Delacorte , $ 15.95 ; 384 pp. ) arrived in the mail . I welcomed the opportunity to refresh my memories of the quartet 's earlier adventures and to see what was in store for them in this following summer of their teenage lives . The author @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lens that pans continually across the friends in a skillfully interwoven narrative . <p> The Second Summer is a mother-daughter book . Each of the girls is engaged in a struggle to define herself in relation to her mother and to come to some understanding of her mother 's own defining experiences . <p> Bridget , the only one of the four whose mother is no longer alive , has been forbidden contact with her maternal grandmother since she was 7 . She is the athlete of the group , having spent the first summer at soccer camp where she had her first romance , with a staff member , which did not end well . She has given up athletics , put on weight and darkened her blond hair in an attempt to redefine herself . <p> She has also decided to spend the summer in the small Alabama town where her grandmother lives without revealing who she really is . She rents a room in a boarding house and is hired by her grandmother to clean out a memory-laden attic so it can become a guest room for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deepens , Bridget learns about her mother 's own troubled past , and this enables her to understand the causes of her early death . <p> Lena spent the previous summer on the Greek island where her grandparents live . There , Kostos , an extraordinary young man , managed to break through her legendary emotional reserve to begin a torrid romance . But once back on her own turf , Lena 's defenses reasserted themselves and she broke off the relationship . When Kostos appears in the States for a summer internship , the relationship is reignited . <p> Meanwhile , in what appears to be an unrelated subplot , Lena learns from her friends ' mothers , all of whom have known each other since they were students together in a birthing class , that there was a mystery man in the life of Ariadne , Lena 's mom , whom she refuses to acknowledge or discuss . <p> In the end , the two tracks merge as we see Lena 's romance following the same tragic path as her mother 's . <p> Tibby spent the previous summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an extraordinary 12-year-old whom she befriended . This summer she is off to a college campus where she is taking a film course and , more important , figuring out which relationships really matter . <p> She connects with a set of shallow friends who encourage her to produce a mocking portrait of her mother as her project for the film course . When her mother appears at the showing , she is crushed by her daughter 's cruelty . <p> Tibby is shocked into reassessing the direction in which her life is going and reconnects with the lessons she learned from Bailey as she lived out her last days . <p> Finally , there is Carmen , who spent a turbulent summer with her father and his new family , struggling with her anger over the breakup of her parents ' marriage and with her jealousy of the life her father has created apart from her . <p> This summer she is home with her mother , feeling doubly angry and abandoned as her mother embarks on a romance with a colleague at work . Carmen does her best to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the romance falters , she comes to see her as a woman with her own right to happiness , independent of Carmen 's self-indulgent needs . <p> As in the first volume , the semimagical pants , which manage to fit all four very differently configured bodies , circulate from one friend to another throughout the summer and even wind up being worn by one of the mothers . <p> However , they seem much less central to the forward movement of the story and to the underscoring of the deep bonds among the friends . The lives of the girls and their mothers are so hugely absorbing in themselves that we hardly need to rely on this device to keep us engaged . <p> These are great stories about complex , not always admirable , characters . The Second Summer may be intended as a chick book , exploring friendship among women and the tangled world of mother-daughter relationships , but this guy , for one , ca n't wait till next summer . <p> I 've reviewed Will Weaver 's earlier books about baseball in a small Minnesota town @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 15.95 ; 240 pp. ) , is set in the same territory , but this time he 's exploring issues similar to those of The Second Summer . <p> Jed Berg learns about aspects of his architect-father 's life that he 'd rather not know . Dad is carrying on an affair with a client for whom he is designing a lakefront house in a distant town . <p> The source of this knowledge is Laura Sanborn , the daughter of the client , who attempts to enlist Jed in breaking up the affair so the two families can return to their previous state , which both teenagers ultimately come to see as less rosy than they had originally thought . <p> It 's almost obligatory these days for a young-adult novel to include e-mail and instant messaging as part of its plot machinery . Claws is no exception . Jed and Laura 's plans unfold , in part , during their frequent electronic exchanges , and it is through these notes that we watch what was initially a very hostile relationship slowly morph into a romance of its own . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the tragedy that closes out the story also provides the opportunity for a reconciliation between Jed and his father as , together , they face the losses that will define their lives . <p> Weaver is a masterful storyteller . He never allows the action to bog down , and his rich sense of place adds texture to the events and to the characters who enact them . <p> Finally , another repeat author , Amy Goldman Koss . I reviewed her previous book , The Girls , a multivoiced exploration of the cruel world of female adolescent friendship and betrayal . In her new book , The Cheat ( Dial , $ 16.99 ; 144 pp. ) , she uses the same shifting point of view to explore the effects of a cheating scandal on the lives of a group of eighth-grade classmates . <p> It all begins with Jake , an unpopular boy trying to win favor with Sara , the class beauty , by supplying her with a copy of last year 's geography midterm he 's acquired from his sister . <p> Sara shares the answers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has changed the exam . The deed is discovered because of the repeating pattern of incorrect answers in the miscreants ' tests . <p> From then on , the story is about the reactions of the various participants and their families . Rob , who fears his abusive father , refuses to return home to face his father 's wrath . Dan , of upstanding reputation , must face the anger of his mother and his girlfriend , both of whom are more concerned about how his actions affect their public images than they are about him . <p> And finally , Katie , Sara 's best friend , who backed out of using the illegally acquired answers , must combat Sara 's suspicions that she is the one who ratted on the cheaters . Katie proves herself to be the heroine of the story as she organizes a boycott among the students in an effort to support her best friend against unreasonable pressures being imposed on her by the school administration . <p> The book is a good conversation starter for middle-schoolers about the temptations and consequences of cheating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially in comparison to The Second Sisterhood . Nonetheless , it 's a good read , and my students who gobbled up The Girls will surely do the same for The Cheat . <p> TYPE : Book Review
