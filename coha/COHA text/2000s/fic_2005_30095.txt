The North of England December 1919 He ran through the snow , face into the swirling wind , feet pounding deep trenches into the accumulating drifts . Rocks , their shapes no longer familiar under the soft white blanket , sent him sprawling , and he dragged himself up again , white now where the snow clung , and almost invisible in the darkness . He had no idea what direction he had taken , enveloped by unreasoning panic and hardly able to breathe for the pain inside him . All he could hear was the voice in his head , shouting at him --  " You will hang for this , see if you do n't . It 's my revenge , and you 'll think about that when the rope goes round your neck and the black hood comes down and there 's no one to save you --  " The sound of the shot was so loud it had shocked him , and he could n't remember whether he had slammed the door behind him or left it standing wide . He could still smell the blood -- so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat like feathers thrown on a fire . He could feel the terror , a snake that coiled and writhed in his stomach , making him ill , and the drumming wild in his head . They would catch him . And then they 'd hang him . There was nothing he could do to prevent it . Unless he died in the snow , and was buried by it until the spring . He 'd seen the frozen body of a dead lamb once , stiff and hard , half rotted and sad . The ravens had been at it . He hated ravens .

He was crying now , tears scalding on cold skin , and the voice was so loud it seemed to be following him , and he ran harder , his breath gusting in front of his face , arms pumping , pushing his way through the snow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this -- see if you don't --  --  !

" CHAPTER TWO Paul Elcott stood in the kitchen beside Sergeant Miller , his face pale , his hand shaking as he unconsciously brushed the back of it across his mouth for the third time . " They 're dead , are n't they ? I have n't touched them -- I couldn't -- Look , can we step outside , man , I 'm going to be sick , else ! " Miller , who had come from a butcher 's family , said stolidly , " Yes , all right . The doctor 's on his way , but there 's nothing he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he added to himself . Poor souls . What the devil had happened here ? " We might as well wait in the barn , then , until he 's finished . " Elcott stumbled out the door . He made his way to the barn , where he was violently sick in one of the empty horse stalls . Afterward he felt no better . He could still see the kitchen floor -- still smell the sickening odor of blood -- And the eyes -- half closed -- staring at nothing the living could see . Had Gerald looked at Hell ? He 'd said the trenches were worse -- He sat down on a bale of hay , and dropped his head in his hands , trying to regulate his breathing and hold on to his senses . He should have sent the sergeant back alone . He 'd been mad to think he could face that slaughter again . After a while , Sergeant Miller came across to the barn , and the doctor was with him , carrying a lantern . Elcott lifted his head to nod at Dr. Jarvis . He cleared his throat and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I mean -- no one lingered --  " " No . I do n't believe they did , " the doctor answered quietly , coming to stand by him and lifting the lantern a little to shine across Elcott 's face . He prayed it was true . He could n't be sure until the autopsies . Without moving the bodies , he 'd been able to find only a single gunshot wound in each , to the chest , with resulting internal trauma . Sufficient to kill . A surge of sympathy swept Jarvis and he reached out to press Elcott 's shoulder . The bloody dead were this man 's family . His brother , his brother 's wife , their children . An unspeakable shock . . . The doctor himself had been badly shaken by the scene and found it difficult to imagine how he would answer his wife , when she asked him why the police had come to fetch him in the middle of his dinner . Nothing in his practice had prepared him for such a harrowing experience . It was , he thought , something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , peaceful farmhouse . At length he said gently to Elcott , " Let me take you home , Paul , and give you something to help you sleep . " " I do n't want to sleep . I 'll have nightmares . " Without warning Elcott began to cry , his face crumpled and his chest heaving . His nerve gone . The doctor gripped the weeping man 's shoulder , and looked to Sergeant Miller over his head . " I wish I knew what 's keeping Inspector Greeley -- his wife told me he 'd gone to see if the Potters needed help getting out . I hope to God he has n't stumbled on anything like this ! " " We 'll know soon enough , " the sergeant replied . They listened to the sobbing man beside them , feeling helpless in the face of his grief . " I ought to take him home , " Jarvis said . " He 's no use to you in this state . You can wait for Greeley . When you 're ready for me , I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best , then . " He glanced at Elcott , then jerked his head , moving to the door . Jarvis followed him . The two men stood there in the late afternoon light , gray clouds so heavy that it was difficult to tell if dusk was coming , or more snow . It had been a freak two-day storm , fast moving with a heavy fall , and the skies still had n't cleared . The roads were nearly impassable , the farm lanes worse . It had taken Miller a good hour to reach the house , even following in the ruts left by Elcott 's carriage . " There 's one still missing . " Miller pitched his voice so that Elcott could n't hear him . " I daresay Elcott 's not noticed . I 've walked through the rest of the house . He 's not there . " " Josh ? By God , I hadn't -- Is he in the outbuildings , do you think ? " Jarvis shivered and glanced over his shoulder at the unlit interior of the small barn , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gear stacked neatly , the hay in the loft , filling half the space . Two horses and a black cow watched him , ears twitching above empty mangers . " Gerald Elcott was always a tidy man . It should n't take long to search . " Miller counted on his gloved fingers . " Elcott penned his sheep , against the storm . I could see them up there to the east of Fox Scar . Stabled his horses , and brought in the cow . At a guess , then , he was alive this time Sunday , when the snow was coming down hard and he knew we were in for it . But the cow 's not been milked since , nor the stalls mucked out , nor feed put down . " " That confirms what I saw inside . I 'd say they 've been dead since Sunday night . " Jarvis frowned and stamped his feet against the cold , torn . " I should stay until you 've found Josh . In the event there 's anything I can do . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If the rest are dead , the boy is as well . I 'll manage . " The doctor nodded . He was moving toward Elcott again , when Miller cautioned , " Best to say nothing about what we 've seen "  - -  he gestured to the house --  " in the village . Until we know a little more . We do n't want a panic on our hands . " " No . God , no . " Jarvis handed the lantern to Miller and settled his hat firmly on his head against the wind . Raising his voice , he said , " Now then , Paul , let 's take you home , and I 'll find something to help you get past this . " " Someone has to look after the animals , " Elcott protested . " And I want to help search . For whoever it was killed them . I want to be there when you find this bastard . " " That 's to your credit , " Miller answered him . " But for now , I 'd go with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the beasts , and there 'll be someone to care for them tomorrow . Leave everything to us . As soon as we know anything , I 'll see you 're told . " Elcott walked to the barn door and stepped outside , unable to turn away from the silent house just across the yard . " I wish I knew why , " he said , his voice ragged with grief . " I just wish I knew why . What had they ever done to deserve --  ? " " That 'll come out , " Miller told him calmly , soothingly . " In good time . " Elcott followed Jarvis to the horse-drawn carriage that had brought the doctor out to the isolated farm . The only tracks in the snow were theirs , a hodgepodge of footprints around the kitchen door of the house , and the wheel markings of the two vehicles , cart and carriage . Beyond these , the ground was smoothly white , with only the brushing of the wind and the prints of winter birds scratching for whatever they could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his , Elcott stopped and said , " Dr. Jarvis -- I can't --  " " Leave it for Sergeant Miller , if you will . He 'll bring it back to town later . I expect he 'll need it tonight " " Oh -- yes . " Dazed , Elcott climbed into the carriage and settled himself meekly on the seat , stuffing his cold hands under his arms . By the time Inspector Greeley had completed his examination of the Elcott farmhouse , he was absolutely certain of one thing . He needed help . Five dead and one missing , believed dead . It was beyond comprehension -- beyond the experience of any man to understand . In Urskdale with its outlying farms and vast stretches of barren mountainous landscape , his resources were stretched thin as it was . The first priority was making certain that all the other dale families were accounted for , that this carnage had n't been repeated -- God forfend !  - -  in another isolated house . And there was the missing child to find . All the farm buildings , sheep pens , shepherds ' huts , and tumbled ruins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the crevices , the small dips and swales , the banks of the little becks . It would take more men than he could muster . But he 'd have to make do with what he had , summon the dale 's scattered inhabitants and work them to the point of exhaustion . And time was short , painfully short , if that child had the most tenuous hope of surviving . Overwhelmed by the sheer enormity of what lay ahead , Greeley did what his people had done for generations here in the North : He buttoned his emotions tightly inside and grimly set about what had to be done . It was well after midnight when he got back to the small police station that stood six houses from the church on the main street of Urskdale . The inspector laboriously wrote out a message and found an experienced man to carry it to the Chief Constable . " Make the fastest time you can , " the man was told . " It 's urgent . " On his drive back to the police station , Greeley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , roughly grouping them by proximity . And then , to keep his mind busy and away from that dreadful , bloody kitchen , he had considered what the searchers would need -- lanterns , packets of food , Thermoses of tea , rope . But that was easier ; each man would know from experience what to bring . Locating lost walkers in the summer had taught them all how to plan . Jarvis had said two days -- that the Elcotts had been dead two days . This madman had already had more than sufficient time to track the boy over the snow , and then vanish . Or spread his net to other victims . . . What in hell 's name would the search parties discover , as they knocked on doors ? Greeley capped his pen and set it in the dish . A general warning now would come far too late to help anyone else . But the search had to go on . A search for the boy , for the killer -- for other victims . As he rose to leave , turning down the lamp on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murderer was an Urskdale man ? Where had he spent these last forty-eight hours ? Safely at home by his hearth ? If he had n't found the boy after all , would he make certain that he was included among the searchers ? What if he , Greeley , was about to set the fox amongst the hounds , unwittingly sending the killer out with an innocent man , to search for himself ? He felt as if he 'd not slept for a week -- the tension in his body and the nightmare in his mind seemed to envelop him . In the darkness the inspector rubbed his gritty eyes with his fists . When he walked out the door to face the somber men collecting outside the station , would one of them look away , unable to meet his glance ? Would he read suspicion into the turn of a head or the restless stamp of feet ? He knew each individual in his patch too well to believe one of them was a vicious killer . Or -- until now he 'd thought he did . More to the point @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; he could n't afford to speculate . Still , he would send them out in threes , not twos . Just in case . As he finally strode down the passage , he could hear the first arrivals talking among themselves , coming in , some of them , as soon as the news reached them . A few at a time , on foot , on horseback , their numbers slowly swelling . The blast of icy air hit him in the face as he went through the door , a shock to warmed skin . Nothing , he thought , to match his shock at the Elcott farm . In all his years as a policeman , he had never seen anything like the scene in that farmhouse kitchen . Try as he would , he could n't imagine the kind of malevolence that could do such a thing . Try as he would , he could n't shut it out of his mind . He and his men had lifted the five stiff bodies onto blankets and carried each out to the waiting cart . He could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so lightly in his arms . Blind anger swept him so that he felt sick with it , helpless and for the first time in his life , vengeful .
