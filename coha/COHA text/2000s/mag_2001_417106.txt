She was young , vibrant , ready for adventure-and stuck in a castle in Scotland . Then came an invitation to Cornwall from an aunt she 'd never met .... / By caroline Harvey // ALEXANDRA 'S FATHER WAS WHERE HE ALWAYS WAS IN THE AFTERNOONS of midwinter-in the meadows of Castle Bewick with the sheep . He paused when he saw Alexandra by the iron railings that separated mown lawn from pasture . She waved and then leaned on the fence , indicating that there was no need for him to hurry . Her heart was hammering , but she knew that if she breathed slowly and deeply , the thudding would subside . " Well , my lass ? " James Abbott held the crook he carried every day . - " A bad day , Father , " she told him . - James looked toward the house briefly , understanding that his wife and daughter must have had another confrontation that had driven Alexandra out of doors . " Get a fork , then , " he said . She took a pitchfork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out a wedge of tawny grasses . Then she followed her father toward the flock to feed the smallest sheep at the rear . The comforting ritual of the work gave her pleasure and freedom to think . When she was nine , Alexandra had learned that her mother had married beneath her , far beneath , choosing a local shepherd and farmhand . But she was , in a sense , lucky to get James Abbott , given that she was over 30 and had a withered leg . Once Alexandra had gotten over the shock , she found it less surprising that her mother should have married her father than vice versa . He was indifferent to the house and took no interest in his wife 's wealth . It was the farm that was his passion . But if her father had married for sheep and land , he had given good measure in return . Alexandra sometimes found his patience with her mother hard to endure , for he would brook no criticism of her even from his beloved daughter . Photograph // " We 've no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no burdens like hers , " he 'd say . He had , of course , known Alexandra 's maternal grandparents-that glamorous couple whose fabulous exploits in Afghanistan cast such a long shadow over their granddaughter 's existence-but he saw them in a light so different from his wife 's that they seemed hardly the same people . " Alexander Bewick was no farmer , " he would say . " And Charlotte Bewick could no more keep house than fly to the moon . " He did not believe in dwelling on things . When Alexandra had asked him if her grandparents had really been as beautiful as their legend proclaimed , he 'd told her to look at their portraits in her mother 's sitting room and would say no more . Her mother , on the other hand , never tired of talking about her parents , holding them up as glorious examples for Alexandra to emulate-and to be measured against and found lacking . " Do you realize that , by your age , your grandmother was a national heroine ? " her mother had asked that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She 'd traveled , risked death , been involved in escapades that left the public gasping at her bravery . " Alexandra had known what was coming next because it was always the same . " And you .. you , " her mother went on , " achieve nothing . All you ever do is idle and dream , mooning through your days , dabbling at this and that with no direction . " They 'd been through it all before , so often . Alexandra could not be what her mother wanted . She didt have it in her to aspire to great mastery in music or art or scholarship , and the world had changed too . There was no way in 1905 that she could rush about Afghanistan performing wondrous deeds , as her grandparents had more than 50 years earlier . It was absurd . Now a few snowflakes began to drift out of the leaden sky . Alexandra leaned on her fork and looked up . " Go in , " her father called to her . She hesitated . She did n't want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak she 'd seized from the hallway , so laying down her fork carefully , she went off toward the house . THAT EVENING , THERE WAS GAME SOUP for dinner , and haddock , carrots , potatoes , and a pudding flavored with marmalade that Alexandra detested . " No , thank you , " she said when offered the pudding . Her mother frowned faintly . " A letter came today from your greataunt , Emily . She is not well again . " " Is she very ill ? " Alexandra asked . Aunt Emily was Charlotte Bewick 's younger sister and the only person besides her parents who had remembered Alexandra 's birthdays throughout her childhood , sending parcels from Cornwall . " She always imagines herself so . " " She is quite old , " Alexandra said . " And she lives alone- " " Alone ? My dear child , she has more servants than she knows what to do with . She is a widow who lives like a queen and complains if she has the smallest twinge . It is so like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until the spring . " " If I may go to Cornwall ? " Alexandra asked . " She asked for me ? " Her mother sighed . " She did . She used to ask my mother , too , endlessly attempting to work upon her softheartedness . " Alexandra was holding her hands tightly in her lap , one gripping the other . " Oh , may I go ? She may not live long , and I wo n't ever have known her . And she may be really ill and need me- " " If she 's ill , then Alexandra should go . " James looked down the length of the table at his wife . " Yes , she should . " " No ! " Her mother shouted in her surprise at his position . " No . Of course , Alexandra ca n't go . Please , James ... " She put out a hand , imploring him . He got up and grasped it . " I do n't interfere often between you and the lass , my dear . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And there 's no life for her here . I could wish the first chance that came her way was n't nursing some poor old woman , but it 's a start . It 'll be different . Aunt Emily lives more in society than we do . Cornwall is another way of life . Alexandra can come home if she wants to , but go she will . " Photograph Aunt Emily lived alone , but " like a queen , " Alexandra 's mother said , " with more servants than she knows what to do with . " // When his wife remained silent , he said to her , " Come now , my dear . Here 's your stick . I 'm coming to sit with you tonight and have a dram . " He helped her to her feet and drew her arm through his . She went out of the dining room without saying another word or looking back at Alexandra . unt Emily was sitting up in bed in a profusion of pillows . The room had a pearly glow , lit by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look young for your age , " she said . Alexandra smiled . " So do you . " " I 'm eighty-four , " Aunt Emily said . " I was over sixty when you were born . That 's the only time I saw you , at your christening . You wailed all the way through it . I can still see your furious little red face . " Alexandra leaned back in her chair and looked around . She was deliciously warm for the first time since leaving Scotland , and when she 'd arrived , but an hour before , she had come straight up to Aunt Emily 's room and been given a tray of tea and tiny biscuits flavored with almond . " Did you think you would find me very ill ? " Aunt Emily asked . " Mother- " Alexandra began , and stopped . " Said I was pretending . I do pretend a little , sometimes . I suppose it amuses me . But now that you are here , I shall be well at once . It 's a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did the journey alarm you ? " " No , it was exciting . " Aunt Emily eyed her . " Some Bewick in you after all , then . " " Oh , Aunt Emily ! Riding first class , waited on hand and foot , it 's hardly traveling in the Bewick sense . " The door opened . Without looking around , Aunt Emily said to the maid , " I suppose you have come to take Miss Alexandra away . " " That 's right , ma'am . " Aunt Emily fumbled beneath her pillows and pulled out a small red leather journal . " Take this with you , Alexandra . It 's a diary I kept when I accompanied Charlotte to India . You should read it . Not tonight , because traveling always distorts one 's feelings for a time , but at your leisure , when you feel settled . You should know about her , the real her . Because you are her granddaughter , there is something of her in you . " " I do n't think so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so miserable , that I do n't resemble her in any way . " You wait , " Aunt Emily said . " Wait and see . " ALEXANDRA 'S BEDROOM WAS AS UNLIKE her bedroom at Castle Bewick as it could be . She was used to drafty spaces and soaring walls , so to find herself in a low , warm room where every surface was cushioned and padded , designed for comfort , was a revelation indeed . She had only been there a few minutes , reveling in the multiplicity of objects and fabrics , when a maid crept in and indicated shyly that she would unpack . She was perhaps 15 years old , small and sturdy , with a bright complexion . " I 'm to wait on you , miss . Seeing as you 've no maid of your own . " " What is your name ? " " Liddy , miss . " Alexandra 's father had said Cornwall might be different , and how different it was . At Castle Bewick , she would not have dreamed of sitting by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put away in drawers . She closed her eyes and tried to picture herself back in Scotland , but the image would n't come ; it was blotted out in this rosy room . In the morning , when Liddy folded back the shutters , bright sunlight burst in like an explosion . The dining room , too , was full of sharp yellow light as Alexandra ate breakfast . Beyond the window , the garden sloped in terraces , intricately cultivated ; rising beyond were green fields , each outlined with a stone wall . " Is the sea over there ? " Alexandra asked the butler , Penman . " A mile or so , Miss Alexandra . The river runs to it . Down that way . " It suddenly seemed a waste to be sitting over muffins . " Can I get to the river through the garden ? Is it far ? " Penman refilled her coffee cup . " Mrs. Talbot asked for you , Miss Alexandra . You 're to go up to her room when you 're done with breakfast . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regretful eye out the window . AUNT EMILY WAS WEARING A DIFFERENT lace cap , another fine , soft shawl . " And did you sleep well ? " she asked . " Oh , yes , " Alexandra said . " I think it 's because of the sea air . I 'd love to visit the sea . " " All in good time , " Aunt Emily replied . " We have so much to do first . I shall ask my dressmaker to come , and we will see about some new clothes for you . And then , of course , there are all the people who will want to meet you . " She paused and then said , " Do n't pull a face , my dear . " " Aunt Emily , it is n't any good . It would be a waste of time . I should n't know what to say to people . " " And that is how you will remain , is it ? Awkward in company ? " " Am I awkward ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if you are n't in proper charge of your arms and legs , and as if your clothes were uncomfortable . " " They are , " Alexandra said , then caught her aunt 's eye and laughed . Aunt Emily said , " You are a dear child . I do n't want to make you different , merely easier . Should n't you like a new dress ? " " Not particularly , " Alexandra said truthfully . " Well , I should like to see you in one , " Aunt Emily said without rancor . " I am used to pretty things . They give me pleasure . " " I-I did n't mean to be ungrateful . Or rude . I just find it difficult to be interested in clothes or how I look . " " What do you like instead ? " " I should like to go and look at the sea " " Then I will give you three things , " Aunt Emily said . " I will give you new frocks and some company manners , whether you like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good deal of freedom to look at the sea . " TRUE TO HER WORD , AUNT EMILY ROSE from her bed . Over the following days , Alexandra would find her by the fire in the drawing room in the afternoons . Then she began coming down in the mornings . The dressmaker called , and two men arrived with bolts of wools , flannels , and silks , which were laid out across the drawing room sofa . Aunt Emily did not consult with Alexandra when choosing . " This wo n't give you any pleasure , Alexandra , so I shall give some to myself . " A gray coat and skirt were made , and a pearl gray silk blouse with a tall frilled collar . It was followed by two afternoon dresses with tiny waists and pleated sleeves . Then came a box of hats , huge , wide , and accompanied by an army of pins to secure them . And two little silk handbags and gloves . " Please stop , " Alexandra said . " It 's so kind of you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's part of the process , " Aunt Emily said . Liddy insisted on doing Alexandra 's hair at least twice a day . And Aunt Emily made her practice walking and sitting down gracefully in her sweeping skirts . " You must glide , Alexandra , not march . " " Did .. did Grandmama glide ? " " Yes , when she needed to , " Aunt Emily said , " but she often strode rather forcefully too . Have you read my journal ? " " No , " Alexandra said . " Not yet . I 'm waiting for the right moment . " " What sort of moment ? " " When .. when I feel a small bit like her . When I feel in sympathy . " AFTER THREE WEEKS , THE FIRST CALLERS came . Alexandra , in one of her new afternoon dresses , her hair carefully drawn up by Liddy , waited in the drawing room on the edge of the sofa . " There is no need to be so stiff , my dear , " Aunt Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No . I am . Inside . " " That will pass , " Aunt Emily said . Then the first knock sounded at the door . Penman opened it , and Aunt Emily looked up . " Mrs. Burrows ! How good you are to come . " Alexandra stood , found she was standing on her own hem , bobbed to release herself , and confronted a large , commanding woman who took no notice of her . As talk flowed between Mrs. Burrows and Aunt Emily-about the rector and his unruly family and young Harry Burrows 's doings at Oxford and the poor hunting season  --  Alexandra felt invisible . But when their caller left , Aunt Emily said , " You were very modest and proper . Not at all a bad beginning . " The next visitor , Mrs. Langley , was alarming because she brought with her two daughters , Rose and Grace , who were both younger than Alexandra and seemed to have no trouble at all managing their skirts , hats , and gloves . They talked about their cousins , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , all of which left Alexandra confused and bewildered . " So fortunate that you are so close in age to Rose and Grace , " Mrs. Langley said . " Young people in these parts have the best times . Shall you be hunting on Tuesday ? " " No , no , " Alexandra said , crimson with mortification . " I have n't ever hunted . I .. I should n't know what to do . " Mrs. Langley eyed her . " I see , " she said , and then all three women rose at once , shaking out their skirts with graceful gestures , and moved out of the drawing room . Aunt Emily had her eyes closed . " I 'm tired now , child . Tell Penman , will you , that you will see any further callers . I 'm going to my room . " " Not on my own , " Alexandra said . " Not without you ! " " You can manage quite well , " Aunt Emily said . " Come and see me after tea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the sofa , but sat rigid , her heart pounding at the dreaded sound of wheels on the gravel of the drive . Her new corset dug into her waist . The knock sounded like a knell . ( continued on page 175 ) Alexandra 's eyes fixed themselves in terror on the door . It opened and Penman said , " Mrs. Chamberlain , Miss Abbott . " " My dear , do n't get up . Please do n't . I 'm the rector 's wife . I should have come earlier , but all the children had measles , all five , and you can not imagine what hard work it is , day and night . I do hope your aunt is n't ill again . I expected to find her up . Her card indicated she was ready for callers again . " Mrs. Chamberlain was most consoling in appearance . She wore a flannel coat and skirt that even Alexandra could see were badly cut . Her hair escaped in wayward fronds from beneath a hideous brown hat , and her eyes , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She is better , thank you , " Alexandra said , " but tired . We have had four callers already . " " Who , my dear ? Do tell . I like to know everything that 's going on , and I 've been dreadfully out of touch . " Alexandra told her and then added with enthusiasm , " I should love to come and see your children . I really should . " " Really , my dear ? It would be kinder than you know . There are so many sick in the village that I should visit . If you would stay with the children , I could get round to some of the cottages . Tomorrow ? Would you come tomorrow ? " Alexandra thought of tomorrow afternoon , presumably in her other new dress , waiting in the drawing room for the thud of the knocker . " Yes , " she said firmly . " I should be happy to . " " It 's the gray house beside the churchyard . " Alexandra nodded , and when Mrs. Chamberlain had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an animated look , as if the last caller had stirred everything to action . Smiling to herself at the thought and confident that it was now too late for other visitors , Alexandra went upstairs . do n't think you 'll care for it at the rectory , " Aunt Emily said the next afternoon as Alexandra I was heading out . " There are five children , all woefully undisciplined . They will tear you to pieces . " " I 'll be fine , " Alexandra said . As she stepped out the front door , she felt like a bird freed from its cage . The sky was blue , and the air was soft and fresh . She walked fast to the village , comfortable in her old corset that she 'd told Liddy was quite sufficient for visiting children . At the rectory , she went boldly to the front door and let the brass knocker fall with a thump . There was an immediate squealing from inside , like a horde of piglets , and then the door opened , revealing a tumble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by tugs , her hands and skirts clutched and pulled . " Oh , Miss Abbott , how good you are to come , " Mrs. Chamberlain said . The children propelled Alexandra into a large square room at the back of the house , with a table in the center . The floor was littered with wooden bricks and fragments of dolls and soldiers . " Go now , " Alexandra said to Mrs. Chamberlain , " and do all the things you have to do . I 'll amuse the children . I shall be perfectly happy . " " Shall you , my dear ? I do n't like to leave you all on your own . " " Please , " Alexandra said . " I 'll be fine . Really , I will . " The door closed behind Mrs. Chamberlain and silence fell at once . The children gazed up at Alexandra , all five of them , their confidence vanished in their mother 's going . " Now listen , " Alexandra said , " We shall play an acting game , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cabin . Those chairs are a forest nearby where a lion lives . A terrible lion . The fireplace is a volcano . Now I want you to find something that will do for guns . " More than an hour later , Mrs. Chamberlain opened the door to find all her children under the table eating lion stew out of an old bowler hat doing duty as a cooking pot . " You are a miracle , my dear , " she said to Alexandra . " How do I reward you ? Dear Miss Abbott , how do I possibly reward you ? " " The children have told me you have hens , " Alexandra said shyly . " I should like to see them . " " My dear , the very thing ! You shall take some eggs back to your aunt . " The hens lived in the orchard , where they moved about picking their way on spindly yellow legs . They were a beautiful color , a rich russet , and their combs and wattles were scarlet . " Oh ! " Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mrs. Chamberlain smiled . " I 'm so glad you appreciate them . " " How many would one need for a small household ? " Alexandra asked . " Roughly two hens a person , my dear . Did you not have them in Scotland ? " " We did , but the shepherds " wives looked after them . I did n't . " " They do n't need much looking ofter . You only have to shut them up at night because of the foxes . They put themselves to bed . My dear , I do n't want to hurry you , but the days grow dark early . I ca n't thank you enough for coming . Really , I ca n't . I hope you 'll come again whenever you feet like it . " Alexandra stooped and kissed the children in turn . " Yes , " she said . " I should like to very much . " THAT NIGHT , SITTING BY AUNT EMILY 'S bed , she said , " Would you let me keep hens , Aunt Emily ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Chamberlain has more than a dozen , and she gave me such beautiful eggs to bring home . It would be such a pleasure . I should keep them in the orchard . Oh , please , may I ? " Aunt Emily smiled at her in a puzzled manner and picked up a letter that lay on the quilt . " I suppose you may if you want it so much . Now look at this , Alexandra . It 's an invitation from Mrs. Burrows asking you to dine next week ! You shall go in the carriage , and you may borrow my pearls . Dear Alexandra , I think things are just beginning ! " DESPITE HER LOVELY NEW SILK gown-the first true evening dress she 'd ever owned-her carefully adorned hair , two ropes of pearls , and Aunt Emily 's assurance that her transformation was a triumph , Alexandra was desperately uncomfortable the entire evening . Mrs. Burrows 's son , Harry , home from Oxford , took her in to dinner . There were nine-nine !  --  courses . She dared not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she felt she could n't breathe , laced into her frock . When ice cream was offered , she put her spoon into it , and a whole glistening wedge slid smoothly from her plate onto the shining table . A footman came and did something deft with spoon , plate , and linen napkin , but there were tears in Alexandra 's eyes , and people stopped talking to watch . Alexandra cried all the way home , To her relief , Aunt Emily had not waited up . But Liddy had . She was in Alexandra 's room with hot milk . " Why , miss , whatever- " " I do n't want to talk about it , Liddy , " Alexandra said . " I just want to sleep . " " Yes , miss . " " And Liddy , not a word to my aunt , please , not a whisper . " At breakfast , there was nothing for it but to pretend it had all been as Aunt Emily would have wished it to be . So Alexandra smiled bravely and spoke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throbbing was beginning in her temple . " I know it 's silly , Aunt Emily , but I 'm so little used to late nights , I feel absurdly tired . I think if I had some fresh air-if I went to the sea , perhaps-I should feel much better . " Photograph Aunt Emily smiled at Alexandra in a puzzled manner . " I suppose you may keep hens If you want to so badly , my dear , " she said . // " Of course , " Aunt Emily said comfortably . " After luncheon . When I am resting , then you may go . " SHE HEARD THE SEA BEFORE SHE SAW IT , murmuring louder and louder with the squeals of gulls cutting shrilly across the booming of the waves . Then she came over the crest of a hill and the ground dropped before her , down to a pale strip of sand and the shifting steely mass of the ocean . She gazed at it with pleasure . How huge it was , surging with power and energy . She began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tussock , her hat coming loose . She snatched it off , scattering pins as she ran . She came to a smooth gray rock , sliced off neatly at the top to make a platform . It was the perfect lookout . Glowing now after her exercise , she hoisted herself onto it and pulled her skirt over her knees , hugging them to her , resting her chin on top . It was , perhaps , the most luxurious moment she had ever known . While the salty air buffeted softly against her cheeks and the gulls wheeled overhead , she let her mind wander out to where sea and sky met , far away in the soft mistiness . " Hello , " a voice called from below her . She felt as if she had been awakened from a deep sleep ; she pulled her mind back , painfully , as if it had been a kite , held to her by only a string . There was a man on the sand below her , black  --  haired , with a beard , dressed in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue eyes , astonishing in his dark face . " I 'm sorry , " he said . " I should n't have disturbed you . It was just such a surprise to see you here . Now I have broken your mood . " Alexandra attempted to get up , was foiled by her skirts , and ended up on her hands and knees , looking directly down into his face . " I-I did n't ( continued on page 182 ) mean to trespass . Mr.- " " Swinton , " he said . " Michael Swinton . " He held out his hand . " May I help you down , Miss- ? " " Alexandra Abbott . " She got to her feet with difficulty , blushed , and put her hand in his . Even through her glove , she could feel his warmth as he guided her off the rock . She saw that he was not a young man , perhaps as much as 40 . He had thick brows and a nose so curved it almost hooked . She felt apprehension rise in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Thank you for your kindness . I wo n't disturb you again . " " I should like you to disturb me a little longer . " " Oh , no ! " she said in fright . " I am asking you to come and see my house , " he said , and held out that strong hand again . " I 'll see you safely home before dark . Do n't worry . Where is home ? " She whispered , " I 'm staying with Mrs. Talbot . " " Ah , a charming woman . I hardly ever see her now because she does n't go out and neither do I. But I used to see her when her husband was alive . She is your- ? " " Aunt , " Alexandra said faintly . His blue eyes were full of warmth . " Come , Miss Alexandra Abbott , and chance your luck . I have a man I will send to tell your aunt that you are quite safe . " She hesitated , then smiled for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said , and he grasped her hand firmly and began to lead her with great skill and speed toward the cliff . is house was a grim , gray dwelling , masked in creeper . The black windows sent out no gleam of lamp or fire . " Do you think it suitable for me ? " he asked . " Properly forbidding ? " She colored . " I see you do . I have my man and a woman from the village . We live in the kitchen together . And I live in my studio alone . I 'm a painter . " He pointed . " There-there are my studio windows . " Facing the sea and the cold north light were the largest windows Alexandra had ever seen , huge soaring panes of glass . " The view and the north light , that 's why I bought the house . Come in and see . " The kitchen reminded her strongly of Castle Bewick , lofty and full of books , papers , candles , pots , plates , cutlery , and other useful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face came out of the pantry . " Miss Abbott , this is Punch . Punch , I want a chair cleared for Miss Abbott , and tea in ten minutes . While you do it , I shall show her the studio . " If Punch was astonished , he gave no sign . Then Michael Swinton guided Alexandra out of the kitchen and along a dark passage . " Now , " he said , " the heart of the matter . " He flung open a pair of doors and revealed a huge room , filled with the gray light of the sea . It was curiously ordered after the kitchen , with canvases in neat stacks along the walls , and a center table covered with pots of brushes , bottles , jars , and tubes of paint . Everything had been arranged with strict symmetry . She walked down the room , looking at the paintings , breathing the smell of paint , turpentine , and linseed oil . He waited by the door in the shadows , watching her . And then she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful . " He let out a long breath . " How very satisfactory you are , Miss Abbott . " " Are you very famous ? " she asked . " I was once . I painted most of the Cabinet and two of the royal grandchildren . Now I do n't paint so fashionably , but I still sell . I have an exhibition in London each spring . " She said in a rush , " I .. I used to dream about being famous . I used to imagine how wonderful it would be . " He came forward to look into her face . " Ah , my dear , " he said gently . " I 'm afraid fame is not wonderful . For me , the more celebrated I became , the worse I painted and the more false I felt . " " So you came here ? " " Yes , just like that . " He smiled . " I imagine , Miss Abbott , that you must be hungry now . Shall we return to the kitchen ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dear corner where a cloth had been laid . On it were two mismatched plates and cups , a milk jug , a block of butter , a loaf on a wooden board , and a fat teapot , just like the one her father used every day . " Miss Abbott , what is it ? Your eyes are full of tears . " " Oh , " she said , " it 's just that the teapot gave me a pang of homesickness . " He took her hand in his warm clasp for a moment and said , " You must pour from it at once and lay the ghost . Punch , will you ride to Mrs. Talbot forthwith and leave a message that Miss Abbott is with me and I will return her within the hour ? " Punch said nothing but slid at once from the room . Michael Swinton cut the bread into thick , satisfying slices , and placed one on Alexandra ! s plate , which she ate gratefully and ravenously . " When did you last eat , Miss Abbott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I could n't eat anything last night at a dinner party at the Burrowses ' house . " She paused and then , because he said nothing , she burst out , " I dropped ice cream on the table . I did n't know how to behave properly . ( continued on page 184 ) ( continued from page 182 ) Aunt Emily is trying to bring me out , and she 's so sweet and generous . She keeps giving me clothes ... I could n't tell her about last night . I ca n't disappoint another person , not after my mother who thinks I 'm so hopeless- " Alexandra put her head down on her plate and dissolved into tears . He did n't speak or try to touch her . He waited until she pulled herself upright again , then handed her his handkerchief . " I shall give you more bread , " he said . He cut another slice and buttered it for her . " Eat that , my dear . " She did as she was told , and when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her cup , he said , " There is a way out , you know , and it does n't have to be fame . I think a more modest aim would make you just as satisfied . What is it that you really like to do ? " She thought for a long time , trying to remember what she enjoyed most . All that came to her were pictures of the farm , the sheep , and the days on the hill with her father . She said slowly , " I like doing things . I liked helping my father with the sheep . A week ago I played with the rectory children . I liked that . And I saw Mrs. Chamberlain 's hens and they were splendid , and Aunt Emily says I may keep some . " He smiled . " You do n't really need advice at all . You are beginning to work out your own salvation . Follow the hens with a goat , or perhaps a cow and a pig or two- " " All those lovely empty fields ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at her intently for a moment . " Perhaps I have a salvation too , " and his eyes were so piercing that she felt a sudden clutch of fear . Perhaps he saw it , for his face relaxed at once and he held out an arm to her . " Now I must take you home , Miss Abbott . " AT PRECISELY HALF PAST TWO THE FOL lowing afternoon , the carriage and the gleaming pair of bays were ready at the front door to take Alexandra on a round of social calls . At 2:35 , wearing a green wool crepe dress with a lace jabot , she came down the steps and climbed in . She sat very erect and thought : I sha n't be afraid Then the carriage went past the orchard wall , and she remembered with a leap of pleasure that her hens would be arriving in two days , and her fright vanished . At the Langley home , a stout butler led Alexandra to the drawing room . Mrs. Langley rose to greet her . Both her daughters and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great bay window . " May I present my nephew , George Langley , " Mrs. Langley said . " You will forgive him rising , but he has injured his ankle . He will be staying with us until it heals , before he returns to Cambridge . " George Langley held out his hand . " I 'm awfully sorry not to get up . " Alexandra was not sure if she should sit down before she was invited , but something possessed her to act boldly , and she seated herself next to George . " We were just discussing hunting , Miss Abbott , " he told her . " We had a splendid day of it yesterday , until I fell and damaged my ankle . " " I like to ride for my own pleasure , " Alexandra said , " but I 'm not at all sure I want to hunt . " Spirited behavior seemed to be easy now that she had embarked upon it . " I 'm going to keep hens . " George burst out laughing . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a charming little bonnet and a pinafore standing in your farmyard and calling your devoted flock . " " I am serious , " Alexandra said . " I am going to learn about hens , and I shall look after them entirely myself . And then I should like to buy a cow and maybe a pig . " " Oh , my hat ! " said George in delight . " You are quite something , Miss Abbott . " She turned to look at him . He was of the same age as Harry Burrows , also tall and dark , but his face was more animated and his manner more genuine . A half hour later , when she gathered her handbag and rose to her feet , she found she had quite enjoyed his company . " You will come again ? Soon ? " he asked . " I shall be laid up with this wretched ankle , so please say you will ! " " Yes , " she said and smiled at him . And she smiled at Mrs. Langley and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she went swiftly from the room , down the steps to collapse into the carriage . She was meant to make other calls , but she ordered the carriage home instead . he day the hens came , squawking faintly in a crate , Aunt Emily received a note from Mrs. Langley . " Listen , my dear , " she said to an impatient Alexandra , whom she had summoned from the orchard . " Mrs. Langley says her nephew George is so depressed , poor boy . She asks if you would be sure to go again and see him . " " Please , Aunt , " Alexandra said , twisting her hands together , eager to be back outside . " Of course I 'll call on George Langley , anything , only please ... I must go . " And she fled back to the orchard , where she contemplated her new charges with great satisfaction while feeding them warm mash . The following Tuesday , she kept her promise and called on George . It was an easy visit . Grace and Rose were not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ page 186 ) ( continued from page 184 ) was sure Alexandra and George could amuse each other very well without her . " Now that you 've come , I 'm even more desperate for you to keep coming , " George said . " I shall be an invalid for weeks . I shall teach you chess . We can have a game that will go on and on . Chess is like that . You will return on Thursday , wo n't you ? " " Yes , " she said , " I will , " and she smiled at him . Again , she went straight home from the Langleys ' ' , although her aunt had instructed her to call on Mrs. Burrows . The house was very quiet . She went quickly up the stairs and to her own room . Liddy was there at once to help Alexandra take the long pins out of her hat . " I shall get into something comfortable , " Alexandra said , " and then I sha n't want anything for the whole afternoon but solitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wardrobe and drew out the journal Aunt Emily had given her . Taking it to the chair by the fire , she sat down , eased off her shoes , put her stockinged feet on the fender , and began to read . She supposed she must have risen at some point to light a candle on the mantelpiece , because when she came to the end of the journal and looked up , bemused and far away , the room was glowing with candlelight . She sat quite still and gazed at the flame , hardly seeing it , so busy was her inward eye upon the scenes that had held her in thrall for two hours . With perfect timing , Liddy came in and began to draw the curtains . " Mrs. Talbot wants you downstairs , miss . She 's ordered tea . There 's a gentleman come . " Alexandra nodded and went down the staircase , still in a waking dream . The drawing room seemed very hot and bright . She saw Aunt Emily seated beside the table that held the silver tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , standing comfortably , was Michael Swinton . He looked different , younger , his hair and beard trimmed , his expression full of vitality . " What have you been doing all this time ? " he asked . He was smiling and his eyes were very blue . She held out the journal . " I knew you would read it sooner or later , " Aunt Emily said . " Well , my dear ? What did you think ? " Emily sat down . " I thought that Charlotte was really and truly fascinating-and lovable as well . " Michael took a chair beside her as Aunt Emily said , " Alexandra is quite like my sister , you know , Mr. Swinton . I see more evidence of it every day . Come and pour for us , my dear . It is a triumph to have Mr. Swinton here , because I believe he has given up drawing rooms entirely . " Photograph George Langley burst out laughing . " I can imagine you , Miss Abbott , in a charming bonnet and pinafore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hens. " // " I have , " he said . " Why have you come now ? " Alexandra asked . " To thank you , " he said . " And to tell you that when you came to my house the other day , it was as if a gale had blown through all the dust and cobwebs . When you had gone , I set up a new canvas , and I have been painting furiously . It has given me real pleasure , and it 's magnificent to feel that way again . So I have come to thank you . " He looked at her with such intensity that she felt a flash of panic and rose hurriedly to busy herself at the teapot . Behind her back , he said , " How are the farming plans ? " " I have a dozen hens , " she said , " and six pullets . " " Excellent . Mrs. Talbot , when will you allow her to keep a cow ? " " A cow ? " Aunt Emily closed her eyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , but I shall . In fact , I think I may come and paint her while she 's milking . " Alexandra ignored the teasing , and the conversation moved on to other pleasant topics . Half an hour later , Michael put down his cup and rose to his feet . He bent and kissed Aunt Emily 's hand , then he turned and said simply to Alexandra , " My dear , thank you , " and was gone . ALEXANDRA FAITHFULLY VISITED GEORGE Langley on Tuesdays and Thursdays . They played chess and bezique and silly paper games . Twice a week , with equal ( continued on page 188 ) ( page 186 ) fidelity , she went to the rectory , partly for conversations about farm livestock with Mrs. Chamberlain , and partly to play with the children . On Wednesdays , to please Aunt Emily , she stayed at home to receive callers . It was tedious , but no longer alarming . The week before Easter , a week in which the air suddenly became soft and springlike , Harry Burrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Aunt Emily 's house with George . " By Jove , Miss Abbott , it 's simply topping to see you , " Harry exclaimed , striding about the drawing room , picking up treasured objects . George said , " We are going to put on a play , Alexandra . We want you to take part . " " You will both think me the poorest sport , " she said , " but I 'm going to refuse . " " You ca n't , " George said earnestly . " It Wo n't be half the fun without you . " The door opened and Penman said , " Mr. Swinton , Miss Alexandra . " Both young men froze . Alexandra noticed their apprehensive expressions with amusement . Michael entered and said to Alexandra , " My dear , you really are holding court . " She introduced them all . Harry and George bowed silently . Then she said , " You have come in the nick of time . I was being asked to act in some amateur theatricals . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George said . " Perhaps you would help to persuade her for us . " Michael settled himself in a chair . " I ca n't do that , I 'm afraid , " he said , " because Miss Abbott is sitting for me , for a portrait . It has to be finished in less than a month . So you see , she has no time . I have commandeered it all . " 11 WE HAD BETTER MAKE THE UE A TRUTH , Photograph When Michael Swinton had gone , Alexandra stood for a long time in front of the looking glass , her hands pressed to her cheeks , her face alive with excitement . // I think , " Michael said to Alexandra when the young men had gone . " Why ? Why did you do it ? " " You needed to be rescued , did n't you ? And I want to paint you . It seemed obvious . " She smiled at him . A strange , wild feeling was beginning to thump in her bosom . " I certainly did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she admitted , and then added shyly , " and I ... I should like to be painted . " " Good . Then we shall begin tomorrow . In the morning . The light is best then . " He stood up . " I must go now . Are n't you going to ask me what you should wear ? " " Should I ? " He smiled . " All the women I ever painted did . It was their first question . " She stood up too . " Well then ? " " Wear what you had on the last time you were at my house . And do n't do your hair too elaborately . " He moved toward the door . " Give my regards to your aunt . " When he had gone , she stood for a long time in front of the looking glass , her hands pressed to her cheeks , her face alive with excitement . Only later , much later , did it strike her that she had no idea why Michael had really called . THE FOLLOWING @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trembling Liddy , who was to act as chaperone , Alexandra was driven to Michael 's house . She was dressed very much as she had been when she trespassed along the shore . At the far end of his studio , near the easel , on a sort of that he would paint in later . He posed her without jacket , hat , or shoes , facing a window , sitting low , her legs bent , her arms wrapped around them , her chin resting on her knees . For a long while , she heard nothing but the rasp of charcoal on canvas , and she simply sat and dreamed and let her mind go floating out into the gray April morning toward the gulls and the sky and the sea . When he said , " Get up and stretch , " she was startled , and as she struggled to her feet , surprised to find herself so stiff . " One more hour , " he said . " That 's enough for you and me . " " May I look ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " ( continued from page 188 ) " When it 's finished . Now sit down again . " At last , he laid down his brush . " You must come back tomorrow and the next day and the next , " he said . " It 's the way I work best , never stopping . " " Will .. will it be good ? " " Yes , " he said . " It will . " n the first week of May , a golden week full of sunshine and birdsong , the painting I was finished . Two weeks later , when it was dry and varnished , Alexandra was allowed to see it . Overcome , she burst into tears . She saw it was herself-so much herself  --  but there , on the canvas , her skin looked luminous , her hair was the color of pale amber , and her eyes were lost in faraway visions . " Do I really look like that ? " she asked . " I only painted what I saw , " he answered . On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry again and could not think why she should . There was a letter waiting for her from George Langley , who had returned to Cambridge , but it did not interest her ; she could hardly be bothered to open it . During the next few weeks , Aunt Emily was not exactly ill , but she rested a good deal . Every day , she let Alexandra take over more and more of the household , ordering what was needed , overseeing repairs , the servants , the account books . A cow came , a soft-eyed Jersey , and a pig , and outbuildings were scrubbed and whitewashed , ready to use as a dairy and cheese room . Alexandra took a great interest in the kitchen garden , too , calculating the bounty it would produce . She spent a good deal of time in the kitchen , making jam and preserving vegetables . The days were full now , very full . It was only sometimes , in the warm dusks , that she felt that life was not perfect . She would stand at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , something straining to get out , urging her toward the kind of excitement she longed for and shrank from all at once . cc LOOK , MY DEAR , " AUNT EMILY SAID . She was propped up on pillows in her bed , reading The Times with a magnifying glass . She handed the paper to Alexandra . " Where , Aunt Emily ? Which item ? " There was no need to ask . The center headline read : THE ROYAL ACADEMY 'S SUMMER EXHIBITION , and below it in smaller type , A TRIUMPHANT REENTRY INTO THE WORLD OF ART . Alexandra read on : A new painting , A in Reverie , is the best to come from Michael Swinton 's brush . Who A is remains a mystery , but she is captured with a fluidity of drawing and subtlety of palette that would be envied by the masters of the French Impressionist School . " Are you not delighted , my dear ? " Aunt Emily said . " Is that not immensely exciting ? " Alexandra replied slowly . " I .. I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Perhaps he wo n't come back now , " Aunt Emily said . " He may rediscover his taste for painting royalty and celebrated actresses . They will be clamoring for him now . " Alexandra felt a cold stone at the pit of her stomach . " Perhaps they will . " The next day brought two letters , one from Cambridge . George had seen the notice in the paper and he was telling everyone he knew who A was . He was proud to know her , he wrote . The second letter was from London , from Michael . My dear Alexandra , I told you it was good , but you knew it , too , I think . You look very lost , hung among royalty , and it makes me homesick to look at you . So I do n't too often . I am besieged with commissions . I might even accept some of them . My regards to your aunt . Yours , MS . ON THE FIRST DAY OF JULY , AUNT EMILY died in her sleep , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the funeral , her lawyer informed Alexandra that she was Emily Talbots sole heir . " House , outbuildings , fifty acres , and thirty thousand pounds , " he told her . " It was always left to you , you know . Mrs. Talbot and her husband drew up their wills after you were born . I remember them going to your christening . " He quite stunned Alexandra . She could say nothing . When he left , she rose from her chair and began to walk slowly about the room , touching the sofa and lamps . Mine , she thought in wonder , all mine . The dining room , bedrooms , kitchens , and pantries , all the animals , fruit , gardens , and every brick in every wall , every slate on every roof , and every tiny plant , all the way to the sea . Mine , mine . She sat down in a chair by a table , put her head on her folded arms and burst into tears of passionate gratitude . CALLERS , SUITABLY AND SOMBERLY attired , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mrs. Burrows and Harry , a tribe of Langleys , George on his own several times . Alexandra received another letter from Michael . My dear Alexandra , You have been much in my thoughts . She was a true friend to lose . Evie , MS Her parents insisted on coming , . to review the situation , " as her father put it in a letter that had alarmed her , in which he 'd also suggested it was not proper for her to live alone . She wished passionately for the visit to be a success ; she delighted in the chance to show her parents the treasure that was hers , but nothing would induce her to leave it . They might come and see how competent she was to run it , but short of abducting her , they could do no more than advise . At the train station , she saw her father first . She called to him ; he swung around , and his face , above his dear and familiar gingery beard , creased with the broadest smile . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms . " It 's grand to see you , my lass , grand . " " Alexandra ! " Alexandra lifted her face . Her mother ( continued on page 192 ) ( continued from page 191 ) was in the doorway of the train , her stick in her hand . " Come here , " she said . Her voice was queer and hoarse . " Child , you are so utterly , completely changed . I can hardly believe- " She broke off and looked at her husband . " Do we not have a lovely daughter ? " THEY STAYED FOR TWO WEEKS . THE house and garden bloomed in golden days full of butterflies , misty mornings , and deep blue dusks . With her mother , Alexandra made peace for the first time in their lives , and she took her father over every inch of her domain . She told him she wanted to buy more cows . He leaned on a wall and surveyed her fields . " If you want to learn about cows , you must breed your own , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . And you 'll be needing another hand if you 're to have more stock . " " Yes , " she said , listening hard . He took out his pipe and lit it slowly . " Abbotts make good farmers , " he said . " We 're not afraid of work . And some Abbotts , my lass , get strokes of good fortune . I 'm one . You 're another . We 'll not forget to be thankful . " " Oh , Father , if only you knew how thankful I am , " she said . " And most of all , that you 'll let me stay . I know you will , because you never would talk about the future like this otherwise . " He put out a hand with uncharacteristic demonstrativeness and touched her cheek . " You just had to find the right path , did n't you , my lass ? And once that was done , you 've stepped out bravely . Never be afraid to step out if it harms no other and gets you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over his . " Thank you , " she said fervently . HER PARENTS TRAVELED HOME , LEAVING her with fields enriched by the presence of a few dozen sheep and enough advice to see her through the cow 's first calving and the sow 's first litter . Then autumn arrived almost before Alexandra realized it , and October and November passed in windy days and wet nights . Alexandra bought herself stout boots and thick , practical tweeds for her forays around her property . Every Wednesday , as a tribute to Aunt Emily , she was at home to callers , and faithfully , once a week , she went to the rectory and played with the Chamberlain children . Her life was both peaceful and satisfying . Two days before Christmas , she learned that Michael had returned to his house . On Christmas morning , wearing Aunt Emily 's fur coat , her hair put up elaborately around her pale gray hat , Alexandra went into the Talbot pew in the village church-her pew now-and knelt to say a prayer of profound thankfulness . The pulpit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Alexandra gazed about her in delight , folding everyone in the village into the warm embrace of her grateful glance . She enjoyed Christmas dinner at the Chamberlains ' ' , where the table was covered in red ribbon streamers and every candle bore a large bow . The whole room , scented with Christmas goose , seemed to glimmer with warmth and merriment , and had it not been for fear of distressing the children , Alexandra would have been happy to burst into tears . She was driven home alone in the quiet , dark night . Later , in her bedroom , she was restless , full of energy and goodwill . She was arrested by a sudden thought . Here she was , possessed of more than she 'd ever dreamed-and Michael was in that bleak , dreary place , his loneliness accentuated by the life he had known these last few months in London . No traditions and Christmas games for him , no decorated tables . Only that vast kitchen and the clutter of bachelor living . Alexandra looked at her clock . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vigorously . SHE WAS FILLED WITH HAPPINESS DRIV ing to his house . She held a basket on her knee , filled with the treats she 'd ordered . She wanted to laugh out loud at the prospect of the delight she would give . The house was dark as she approached . Her carriage stopped before the steps that led to the kitchen door . When there was no answer to her knock , Alexandra turned the handle and stepped in . She went toward the scullery , calling , " Mr. Swinton . Mr. Swinton . " Then she stepped into the kitchen and the glow of firelight . " Ah , you are a vision , but a flesh and blood one . I could not be sure . " He came forward , and she saw that he had been sitting beside the range in a rocking chair . " I can hardly believe it , " he said . " Miss Abbott , in the name of all that is improbable and wonderful , what are you doing here ? " She held up her basket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how blessedly fortunate with all I have , and I thought of you and how lonely you must be after all the company and society you have known recently , and I thought ... I thought- " His blue gaze went from her face to the basket . She waited ( continued ) ( continued from page 193 ) for his smile , his words of thanks , her eyes fixed upon him in happy expectation . " How dare you patronize me ! " he said furiously . " It is horrible  --  horrible- ! - that you should pity me . Giving me crumbs from your great table . You should not be here , Miss Abbott , " he spat at her . " In every way , it is wrong for you to be here ! " Dismay poured through her like a flood . He was terrifying , towering over her . She swallowed , tried to speak , but shame held her tongue . " Get out , " he said . " Oh , Mr. Swinton , " her voice shook badly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorrier than you will ever understand . I never thought I should be ... improper to come , that you should think me patronizing . I just wanted to give you something- " " Stop it ! " he said , turning away from her . " I ... I should go , " she said in a low voice . " I have behaved so badly , I ca n't bear to think I have angered you- " He swung around . " You have n't . Or rather you did , but I judged you too hastily , and I am not angry now . I am extremely-oh , a host of things , but not angry anymore . Will you not stay a while , Miss Abbott ? Since your reputation is now ruined by your own hand ? " She smiled wanly at him , and he gestured to the fire . " Join me in this excellent claret . I do n't suppose you know much about claret , but this is nectar . When he had seated her in his rocking chair and put a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her face was illumined . Then he pulled a chair from the table and sat in it opposite her . " Take a mouthful and hold it for a moment , then swallow very slowly , noticing the taste all the way , " he instructed . " I ... 1 never drank anything like it before . The taste is very big , somehow . " " Ah ! " he said with satisfaction . " I may even give you some more . " She asked without looking at him , " Were you unhappy to be back with fashionable people ? Was it like before , when you were famous and could n't paint ? " " No , " he replied , " it was n't like that at all . I can paint anything I want at the moment . I have never had mastery like this before . " He stood and picked up the candle and went wandering into the shadows . Alexandra swung upright in the rocking chair . Across the room , the candle flickered , illuminating her own bare feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent knee . " But that 's my portrait ! " " Of course , " he said calmly . " What did you think would happen to it ? Did you suppose I should sell it ? " " I did n't think much about it . " He put the candle down on the table . " You never do think much about yourself . That is one of your most powerful attractions , your unself-consciousness . The others are your loveliness , practicality , loving  --  heartedness , and naturalness . You are why I came back , Miss Abbott . I could have stayed in London eating my heart out for you , but the combination of Christmas and not having seen you in months drove me back to this morgue of a house . " She said nothing , but gazed at him with wide , terrified eyes . Then she made a small gesture to ward him off , and he , taking it as a token of reciprocal feeling , stepped forward and took her in his arms . He began to kiss her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flying , and the next moment she was clawing herself free in panic and stumbling for the door . He was there before her , barring her way . She screamed , " No ! No ! Let me go ! " " Calm down , " he said . " I did not mean to frighten you . Come and sit down . " " No ! " she said . " No ! No- " " Do n't be melodramatic . If we part like this , we shall create the most monumental awkwardness for ourselves . Sit down . " She obeyed him , sinking into the rocking chair again . " Alexandra , listen to me , " he said , taking a seat on the edge of the table and regarding her with his steady blue gaze . " I 'm sorry that I frightened you . I forgot how young you are , how inexperienced . I imagined , wrongly , that you wanted me . Now you 've shown me that I was mistaken to think you loved me . That is so , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she did , Alexandra nodded . " I never meant to frighten you , and I 'm sorry that I did . Here , " he stood and held out his hand . " Take my hand to show you forgive me for alarming you . " Her own was shaking , but his clasp was as warm and steady as ever . " Now , Miss Abbott , you must go home , " he said . " We shall meet in the course of things and we will do so on just the footing we have always known . Before tonight , that is . " She rose and stood before him . " Shall you go back to London ? " she asked in a small voice . " Yes , " he replied . " That is exactly what I shall do . Perhaps I may return in the spring . Then you can show me your first lambs . " ( continued ) ( continued from page 195 ) He escorted her to the carriage . As the horses headed out of his drive , Alexandra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth to stop herself from crying . On New Year 's Eve , it snowed . Alexandra woke on the first day of the new year to a soft white stillness and a heavy gray sky that matched her mood . There was little for her to do . The cow would not calve for some days yet . The hens stayed in the henhouse , the sheep in the barn . She thought of turning out drawers or rearranging her bedroom , but disinclination struck her almost before the ideas were formed . When the snow had lain for four days , increasing each night by an inch or so , George Langley appeared on Alexandra 's lawn in snowshoes . " I have come to kidnap you , " he said . " No protests . I will escort you to my aunt 's house . She insists that you come for dinner . " " I should love it , " Alexandra said . " Most of the time , I am absolutely contented here , but I have been fidgety this last week . The weather , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diversion . The Langley home hummed with people , and Alexandra enjoyed herself . But when she returned home , she was greeted with the news that the cow had dropped a fine little calf . It had been a model birth , the first from one of her own animals , and she had missed it . The little calf thrived , and in early February the sow had a litter of 14 . Alexandra drew up plans for a glasshouse to be erected on the southern wall of the stable yard so that she might grow tomatoes , and she had a little downstairs room made into an office . She wrote weekly to her father and received from him equally regular letters full of information and advice . Her mother always added a note that she sent her love . Alexandra also exchanged letters with George , who had begun his last term at Cambridge . His affectionate tone was a balm to her . Of Michael she heard nothing until shortly before Easter , when the village gossip informed her that he had returned to his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from school , called on her . " You look splendid , " he told her , striding into the drawing room . " You always do . I say , I have worked like a beaver this term . I ca n't tell you what a help your letters have been . And guess what ? My uncle has offered me a position in his shipbuilding business . " " Should you like that ? " Alexandra asked . " Shipbuilding ? " George came to sit by her on the sofa . " I do n't suppose I care much about ships , but it is n't the actual business , you know , it 's the prospect of making some money . We ca n't all be as lucky as you are to work for pleasure rather than necessity . " " I know , " Alexandra said . " I am lucky . " He hesitated and then said in a low voice , " I wonder if I shall ever be so lucky . " " In the same way ? " " No , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another way . " She smiled at him . " What other way ? " His hands were clenched together . He said hurriedly , " Alexandra , I did n't come for this , though heaven knows it 's been on my mind for months . The thing is. oh , hang it , Alexandra , I really do love you awfully , and it would mean everything in the world to me if you would marry me . " For a moment , she went on smiling at him , and she was on the point of saying , " Oh , George , of course , " when an abrupt cold horror fell upon her like a cloak . She realized that to accept him would be a catastrophic mistake . She heard herself say , " Oh , no , George , I am afraid I ca n't do that . " The color drained from his face . " You .. ca n't ? " She leaned forward and put her hands around his clenched fists . " I fear I may have led you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , we had fim , like a brother and sister . " " I never felt like a brother , " he said . " I expect that was my fault too , " she said soberly . " I just had no experience . I do n't want to hurt you , George , I 'm far too fond of you . But I should hurt you far more by marrying you and not loving you as a wife should . " " I 'll love enough for both of us , Alexandra , " he cried . " I 've never felt like this before . " " But you will again , " Alexandra said , hating herself . " You are young , as young as I am . We are both young and silly . We are a recipe for disaster . " He looked at her and then stood . " We can still be friends , ca n't we ? " " Of course we are still friends . " Then she added , with a touch of bitterness , " That is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too much of things . " " I suppose , " he said , looking down at her , " there is always a chance that you might change your mind ? " She stood up so that she could look directly into his eyes . " No , George , " she said . " I wo n't change my mind . " SHE LAY AWAKE THAT NIGHT , FLOODED with a curious calm . She realized that she had turned to George for comfort , had used his affection to bind her own wounds , wounds she had inflicted on herself out of inexperience and fright at the unknown . " Never be afraid to step out if it hurts no other and gets you your hearts desire , " her father had said . Well , ( continued on page 198 ) ( continued from page 196 ) she had hurt George , there was no denying that , but until she hurt him she had not seen clearly what her heart 's desire was . Now she saw it . The next move was the stepping out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the journal that Aunt Emily had given her , Charlotte had said that when you knew a thing was right , your whole soul went out to meet it . You could not stop yourself any more than you could stop breathing . She was quite right . Now I know what I want , Alexandra thought , and tomorrow I shall go out and ask for it . There was the terrifying chance of rejection , but it was worth the risk . It was worth any risk . cc E 'S OUT , PUNCH SAID . HE WAS LEAN ing against the door and made no move to invite Alexandra inside . " Where is he ? " Punch shrugged . " On the shore . " E 's got " imself a dinghy . " E 's scraping " er ready for revarnishin ' ' . " " Thank you , " Alexandra said . She picked up her skirts and made her way toward the cliff edge . Down below , on the beach , was an upturned dinghy , resting on trestles above the waterline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the faint rasp of scraping . Slowly and carefully , she picked her way down the cliff , then crunched over the small pebbles toward him . It was n't until she was a yard away that he stopped and looked up . " Miss Abbott , good morning . " " Mrs. Chamberlain told me you were back , " she said . " I have been back a week and have n't seen a soul . " He grinned at her . " How is the farming going ? " " Very well , thank you . I now have a dozen sheep , seven lambs , a cow , a calf , a sow , and fourteen piglets . And that is only a beginning . " " You have come a long way , my dear , " he said quietly . " Yes , I have . And I have you to thank for it . You pointed out the way . " He leaned his arms on the boat so that they faced each other across it . " Did I now ? How nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do is reciprocate and say thanks to the success of my painting you , I now have enough commissions to keep me working until nineteen ten . " " Mr. Langley , " Alexandra began abruptly , changing the subject , impatient to say what she 'd come to say . " George Langley . I know him quite well . " " Do you ? " Michael said without interest . " I am pleased to think you have friends . Youthful romps and so on . " " I 'm not talking about romps , " Alexandra said . " That is n't what I 'm trying to tell you . " " Forgive me for being obtuse . What are you trying to tell me ? " " It 's about George . I met him over a year ago and we became friends . He taught me to play chess , and really , he has been very kind , and yesterday he proposed to me . " Michael pushed himself off the boat and swung around , his back to her . After a moment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , Miss Abbott , I sincerely hope that you will be very happy . " " No ! " she shouted . " No ! That 's not it at all . I refused him . I refused him because I-oh , Mr. Swinton , I was so stupid at Christmas , so hysterical , and I 've been so miserable since . " She stopped ; tears were beginning to blur her vision .

" Miss Abbott-Alexandra-are you making me a proposal of marriage ? " " Yes , I am . Is that very improper ? " " It 's the properest thing I ever heard , " he said unsteadily . " And I accept with my whole heart . " Then he gathered her into his arms again . " Alexandra , we have a great future . Painting and farming , a matchless combination . But you will have to build me a studio on your property if you expect me to live there . And you will have to come to London with me . I sha n't leave you alone for a moment , you know . I warn you that I am exhausting to live with . " " Yes , " she said happily , releasing herself from his arms , stepping back and holding out her hand . " Come with me , then . " He caught her hand and kissed it , and together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gulls cried overhead and the sea , not caring for anything , went on crashing against the rocks on the shore .
