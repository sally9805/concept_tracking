While Wall Street types master the universe on their BlackBerries and geeks tinker with their Treos , urban hipsters , students and celebrities like Paris Hilton have flocked to the more laid-back T-Mobile Sidekick . First released in 2002 , it was a combination cell phone and e-mail device that was easier to use than most handhelds because of a unique horizontal design that allowed maximum space for its keyboard . <P> The Sidekick II , unveiled last week and on sale this fall for $299 , keeps the same basic shape but improves on the original in several ways , including a built-in digital camera with flash , a sharper display and a better speaker design . It comes preloaded with AOL Instant Messenger and Yahoo Instant Messenger . Although this version is slimmer than the original , it 's slightly longer and weighs about the same . Another thing that has stayed the same is the price . Monthly fees are $20 plus the cost of your TMobile calling plan .                @ @ @ @ @
