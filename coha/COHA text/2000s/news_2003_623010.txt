<p> Compared with the Bay Area , any home in the Central Valley falls into the affordable category , right ? Maybe for those who who could expect to pay $700,000 and up for a starter home in Palo Alto or Mill Valley . But it 's harder on longtime residents of outlying areas . <p> As home prices in the Bay Area have continued to rise , buyers are driving farther and farther east to find a good deal , bringing with them Bay Area paychecks that are making homes less affordable for those who live and work in places like Manteca ( San Joaquin County ) and Hollister ( San Benito County ) . <p> " The Bay Area is doing a good job of pricing us out of our homes , " said William Sigh , a Merced resident who owns a small business that repairs car dents . <p> Sigh said a home he built for about $100,000 several years ago was appraised recently at $390,000 . The land value alone shot from about $40,000 to $90,000 . <p> " I could n't afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ According to real estate information company DataQuick , median home prices in Merced , San Joaquin and Stanislaus counties have increased between 73 and 82 percent in the past five years . <p> While median home prices in the Northern San Joaquin remain far below the $400,000-plus median in many Bay Area counties , there is evidence Central Valley natives are feeling increasingly squeezed . <p> About 39 percent of households in the Central Valley could afford a median-priced home there in December , compared with 47 percent in December 2001 , according to a recent report by the California Association of Realtors . <p> In Merced County alone , affordability fell from 50 percent a year ago to 36 percent in December . Affordability in San Francisco , where the 2002 median was $545,000 , remained level at 15 percent . <p> Epifanio Figueroa and his wife , Ana , recently bought a house in Los Banos ( Merced County ) for about $218,000 . Figueroa expects to drive an hour each way to his job as a salesman at a wholesale nursery in Hollister , where he and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We looked around there , but it was impossible to find something we could afford , " he said . " That 's why we 're here . " <p> Carol Whiteside , director of the Great Valley Center , said the Central Valley suffers from the same housing problem afflicting most of the state : Demand far outstrips supply . <p> Whiteside places some blame on Proposition 13 . Because the legislation , approved in 1978 , limited the annual increase in the assessed value of real estate - and hence property taxes - to 2 percent per year ( unless the property is sold ) , municipalities are starved for cash . <p> As a result , Whiteside said , while carpenters and plumbers are hard at work on scores of residential subdivisions , Central Valley cities are particularly keen to give the green light to commercial projects , which generate lucrative sales revenue but may limit the number of new homes . <p> " Right now we 're probably building 150,000 fewer homes ( statewide ) each year than we need because government agencies are n't approving the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roseville 's Dunmore Homes . " That 's a big reason why prices are going where they 're going . " <p> Of course , if interest rates rise and the economy continues to languish , as some economists believe it will , demand for housing throughout the state will cool , which could lower prices in the Bay Area . That , in turn , could severely dampen the Central Valley market - particularly the Northern San Joaquin Valley - which largely acts as an overflow for the Bay Area . <p> For now , though , demand is soaring . As a result , home builders in the Central Valley are finding that land prices are surging - costs they pass on to buyers . Builders also say the cost of getting raw land ready for building can be much more expensive in the Central Valley , where water and sewer lines may not exist , than it is in urban areas . <p> While people hoping to buy a house in the Central Valley can expect to pay more than they would have several years ago , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seeing home prices slip beyond their grasp , according to Whiteside . <p> " It means the ( longtime residents ) do n't get into the market . They buy less house , or they 're frozen in the places where they already live , " said Whiteside . <p> Raymus Development is attempting to keep housing prices down for the local population in its hometown of Manteca , where Antone Raymus founded the home-building firm in 1945 . Whereas other new homes in Manteca start just below $300,000 , houses at Raymus ' Liberty subdivision , a development of more than 120 homes , sell for $189,000 to $209,000 . <p> The houses are relatively small , ranging from 1,400 to 1,700 square feet , but Raymus says they do n't scrimp on design . For instance , the priciest Liberty model has a detached garage , considered desirable because it moves the garage from the front to the back of the property . <p> " I grew up in Manteca . I go to the grocery store with people who buy our homes , " said Raymus ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ president . " We feel like we have to serve our community . . . all the different economic levels . " <p> Raymus said her firm can keep its costs down because it frequently banks property , buying land decades before it will be ready for development , unlike national builders who often buy at the peak of the market and must pass those costs along to the consumer . Raymus employs a small staff of farmers who continue to cultivate the land for years until it can be developed . <p> " We just finished a project that my dad bought when I was in third grade , " Raymus said . <p> " He told me it would probably be developed by my children 's children . But the demand is just so high ( that ) we finished it a lot sooner than we thought we would .
