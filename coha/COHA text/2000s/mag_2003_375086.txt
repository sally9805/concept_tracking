Tax-exempt investors tend to be a conservative bunch . So they may be excused for choking on the sudden sickliness of so-called state tobacco bonds . These unusual securities , whose prices have bucked wildly , are a small part of the $1.8 trillion U.S. municipal-bond market . But they 've infected other bonds , boosting volatility and hurting prices . Yet some bargains have emerged . <P> Do n't get hung up on the unique problems of tobacco bonds , which are state-issued debt backed by future payments of tobacco companies as part of a landmark 1998 liability settlement . States including California and New York have issued some $18 billion of these bonds to get their mitts on the tobacco loot now rather than wait to collect it in dribs and drabs over the next few decades . The bonds have always offered a higher yield than similarly rated munis  --  today , about 5.5% vs. 4.1%  --  because no taxing authority stands behind them , only a handful of private companies that a lot of folks would like to see put out of business . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individuals bought tobacco bonds and are paying dearly for the extra yield . <P> The big trouble started in March , when an Illinois court left the Marlboro Man ( Altria , formerly Philip Morris ) gasping over the prospect of having to post a $12 billion bond before it could appeal an adverse verdict over its marketing of " light " cigarettes . Altria threatened Chapter 11 , its corporate-bond ratings were slashed , and state-tobacco bonds reeled , losing 10% of their value . Virginia postponed a $767 million tobacco-bond sale  --  and that highlighted the real problem . <P> States are in terrible financial shape . Investors are worried  --  especially with tobacco-bond income imperiled  --  that states wo n't be able to service their other bonds . Meanwhile , the Bush Administration 's push to cut taxes on stock dividends could make tax-free bonds less attractive . As a result , yields on the best-quality tax-free munis have reached a rare parity with those of taxable Treasury bonds . In both cases you can get about 4% on a 10-year issue . A T-bond would have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 4% muni for anyone in the 30% tax bracket . <P> The upshot : if tax-free income is what you savor , this is a great time to buy munis . Altria is just blowing smoke about bankruptcy ; indeed , at the urging of a large number of states , Illinois has dramatically reduced Altria 's appeal bond so that it can keep making settlement payments . Even in bankruptcy , the payments would probably continue as an operating expense . And even in the unlikely event that the tax on stock dividends is erased , there will be no massive flight from munis toward stocks . The typical muni investor values stability above all . <P> The states ' overall budget troubles are the biggest danger for muni investors , and ample reason to be very selective . No state has defaulted on its general-obligation bonds since the Great Depression , so stick with these " GOs " or with " essential service " bonds issued by water , sewer or even school authorities . Medium-term maturities of about 10 years are the bond market 's sweet spot today @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a certainty at some point  --  than are those of longer-term bonds .
