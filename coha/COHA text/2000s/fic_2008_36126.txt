A week had passed since my return from London , and I was sitting at the table in the dining room of the small gatehouse of Stanhope Hall , my ex-wife 's former estate , wading through old files , family photos , and letters that I 'd stored here for the last decade . <p> After my divorce from Susan , I 'd fulfilled an old dream by taking my sailboat , a forty-six-foot Morgan ketch named the Paumanok II , on a sail around the world , which lasted three years . Paumanok , incidentally , is the indigenous Indian word for Long Island , and my illustrious ancestor , Walt Whitman , a native Long Islander , sometimes used this word in his poetry-and if Uncle Walt had owned a forty-six-foot yacht , I 'm sure he 'd have christened it the Paumanok , not " I Hear America Singing , " which is too long to put on the stern , or Leaves of Grass , which does n't sound seaworthy . <p> Anyway , my last port of call was Bournemouth , England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had set sail for America three centuries before . <p> With winter coming on , and sea fatigue in my bones , a dwindling bank account , and my wanderlust satisfied , I sold the boat for about half what it was worth and moved up to London to look for a job , eventually signing on with a British law firm that needed an American tax lawyer , which is what I was in New York before I became captain of the Paumanok II . <p> I spread out some photos of Susan on the table and looked at them under the light of the chandelier . Susan was , and probably still is , a beautiful woman with long red hair , arresting green eyes , pouty lips , and the perfect body of a lifelong equestrian . <p> I picked up a photo that showed Susan on my first sailboat , the original Paumanok , a thirty-six-foot Morgan , which I loved , but which I 'd scuttled in Oyster Bay Harbor rather than let the government seize it for back taxes . This photo was taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Long Island Sound . The photograph showed a bright summer day , and Susan was standing on the aft deck , stark naked , with one hand covering her burning bush , and the other covering one breast . Her face shows an expression of mock surprise and embarrassment . <p> The occasion was one of Susan 's acted-out sexual fantasies , and I think I was supposed to have climbed aboard from a kayak , and I 'd discovered her alone and naked and made her my sex slave . <p> The woman had not only a great body , but also a great imagination and a wonderful libido to go with it . As for the sexual playacting , its purpose , of course , was to keep the marital fires burning , and it worked well for almost two decades because all our infidelities were with each other . At least that was the understanding , until a new actor , don Frank Bellarosa , moved in next door . <p> I picked up a bottle of old cognac that I 'd found in the sideboard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've returned to America has to do with the former residents of this gatehouse , George and Ethel Allard , who had been old Stanhope family retainers . George , a good man , had died a decade ago , and his wife , Ethel , who is not so nice , is in hospice care and about to join her husband , unless George has already had a word with St. Peter , the ultimate gatekeeper . " Was n't I promised eternal rest and peace ? Ca n't she go someplace else ? She always liked hot weather . " In any case , I am the attorney for Ethel 's estate and so I needed to take care of that and attend her funeral . <p> The other reason I 've returned is that this gatehouse is my legal U.S. address , but unfortunately , this house is about to pass into the hands of Amir Nasim , an Iranian gentleman who now owns the main house , Stanhope Hall , and much of the original acreage , including this gatehouse . As of now , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gatehouse , meaning she has a rent-free tenancy until she dies . This rent-free house was given to her by Susan 's grandfather , Augustus Stanhope ( because Ethel was screwing Augustus way back when ) , and Ethel has been kind enough to allow me to store my things here and share her digs whenever I 'm in New York . Ethel hates me , but that 's another story . In any case , Ethel 's tenancy in this house and on this planet is about to end , and thus I had returned from London not only to say goodbye to Ethel , but also to find a new home for my possessions , and find another legal U.S. address , which seems to be a requirement for citizenship and creditors . <p> This is the first time I 'd been to New York since last September , coming in from London as soon as the airplanes were flying again . I 'd stayed for three days at the Yale Club , where I 'd maintained my membership for my infrequent New York business trips , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and somber the great city had become . <p> I 'd made no phone calls and saw no one . I would have seen my daughter , Carolyn , but she had fled her apartment in Brooklyn right after 9/11 to stay with her mother in Hilton Head , South Carolina . My son , Edward , lives in Los Angeles . So for three days , I walked the quiet streets of the city , watching the smoke rising from what came to be known as Ground Zero . <p> Heartsick and drained , I got on a plane and returned to London , feeling that I 'd done the right thing , the way people do who come home for a death in the family . <p> Over the next few months , I learned that I knew eleven people who 'd died in the Twin Towers ; mostly former neighbors and business associates , but also a close friend who left a wife and three young children . <p> And now , nine months after 9/11 , I was back again . Things seemed to have returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coffee and cognac and looked around at the piles of paper . There was a lot to go through , and I hoped that Ethel would hold on a while longer , and that Mr. Nasim was n't planning on getting his encumbered gatehouse into his possession the minute Ethel 's life tenancy expired . I needed to speak to Mr. Nasim about that ; speaking to Ethel about hanging on until I tidied up my papers might seem insensitive and selfish . <p> Because the night was cool , and because I did n't have a paper shredder , I had a fire going in the dining room fireplace . Now and then , I 'd feed the fire with some letter or photo that I would n't want my children to see if I suddenly croaked . <p> In that category were these photos of their mother whose nakedness revealed a lot more about her head than about her body . Susan was , and I 'm sure still is , a bit nutty . But to be honest , I did n't mind that at all , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our problem , obviously , was Susan 's affair with the Mafia don next door . And then to complicate things further , she shot and killed him . Three shots . One in the groin . Ouch . <p> I gathered the photos and turned in my chair toward the fireplace . We all have trouble parting with things like this , but I can tell you , as a lawyer and as a man , no good can come of saving anything you would n't want your family or your enemies to see . Or your next significant other , for that matter . <p> I stared into the fire and watched the flames dancing against the soot-blackened brick , but I held on to the photos . <p> So , she shot her lover , Frank " the Bishop " Bellarosa , capo di tutti capi , boss of all bosses , and got away with it-legally , at least-due to some circumstances that the Justice Department found mitigating and extenuating . <p> Fact is , the Justice Department took a dive on the case because they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ don Bellarosa , who was under house arrest in his villa down the road , and who was also singing his black heart out to them , and thus needed to be kept happy with another man 's wife . <p> I 'm still a little pissed off at the whole thing , as you might guess , but basically I 'm over it . <p> Meanwhile , I needed to decide if this trip was a death vigil , or perhaps something more permanent . I had kept up with my CLE-continuing legal education-and I was still a member of the New York State Bar , so I had n't burned all my bridges , and theoretically I was employable here . In my last life , I had been a partner in my father 's old firm of Perkins , Perkins , Sutter and Reynolds , still located at 23 Wall Street , a historic building that was once bombed by Anarchists at the turn of the last century , which seems almost quaint in light of 9/11 . <p> For the last seven years in London , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was their American tax guy who explained that screwing the Internal Revenue Service was an American tradition . This was payback for me because the IRS had screwed up my life , while my wife was screwing the Mafia don . These two seemingly disparate problems were actually related , as I had found out the hard way . <p> I guess I 'd hit a patch of rough road back then , a little adversity in an otherwise charmed and privileged life . But adversity builds character , and to be honest , it was n't all Susan 's fault , or Frank Bellarosa 's fault , or the fault of the IRS , or my stuffed-shirt law partners ; it was partly my own fault because I , too , was involved with Frank Bellarosa . A little legal work . Like representing him on a murder charge . Not the kind of thing I normally did as a Wall Street lawyer , and certainly not the kind of case that Perkins , Perkins , Sutter and Reynolds would approve of . Therefore , I 'd handled this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office , but that was n't much cover when the newspapers got hold of it . <p> Thinking back on this , I could n't help but know I was committing professional and social suicide when I took a Mafia don as a client . But it was a challenge , and I was bored , and Susan , who approved of and encouraged my association with Frank Bellarosa , said I needed a challenge . I guess Susan was bored , too , and as I found out , she had her own agenda regarding Frank Bellarosa . <p> And speaking of Susan , I had discovered through my son , Edward , that , quote , " Mom has bought our house back . " <p> Bad grammar aside-I sent this kid to great schools-what Edward meant was that Susan had reacquired the large guest cottage on the Stanhope estate . This so-called cottage-it has six bedrooms-had been our marital residence for nearly twenty years , and is located about a quarter mile up the main drive of the estate . In other words , Susan and I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property had been carved out of the two hundred sixty acres of the Stanhope estate by Susan 's father , William , who 's an insufferable prick , and deeded to Susan as a wedding gift . Since I was the groom , I always wondered why my name was n't on the deed . But you need to understand old money to answer that . You also need to understand pricks like William . Not to mention his ditsy wife , Susan 's mother , Charlotte . These two characters are unfortunately still alive and well , living and golfing in Hilton Head , South Carolina , where Susan had been living since the unfortunate gun mishap that took her lover 's life ten years ago . <p> Before Susan left for South Carolina , she 'd sold the guest cottage to a yuppie corporate transfer couple from someplace west of the Hudson . You know your marriage is in trouble when your wife sells the house and moves to another state . In truth , however , it was I who ended the marriage . Susan wanted us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lover was dead , and thus we need n't worry about bumping into him at a party . In fact , she claimed that was why she 'd killed him ; so we could be together . <p> That was n't quite it , but it sounded nice . In retrospect , we probably could have stayed together , but I was too angry at being cuckolded , and my male ego had taken a major hit . I mean , not only did our friends , family , and children know that Susan was fucking a Mafia don , but the whole damned country knew when it hit the tabloids : " Dead Don Diddled Lawyer 's Heiress Wife . " Or something like that . <p> It may have worked out for us if , as Susan had suggested , I 'd killed her lover myself . But I would n't have gotten off as easily as she had . Even if I 'd somehow beaten the murder rap-crime of passion-I 'd have some explaining to do to don Bellarosa 's friends and family . <p> So she sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , for the Yale Club in Manhattan , where I am always welcome . But Susan , in a rare display of thoughtfulness , suggested to me that Ethel Allard , recently widowed , could use some company in the gatehouse . That actually was n't a bad idea , and since Ethel could also use a few bucks in rent , and a handyman to replace her recently deceased husband , I 'd moved into the extra bedroom and stored my belongings in the basement , where they 'd sat for this past decade . <p> By spring of the following year , I 'd made a financial settlement with my partners and used the money to buy the forty-six-foot Morgan , which I christened Paumanok II . By that time , my membership in the Seawanhaka Corinthian Yacht Club had been terminated by mutual consent , so I sailed from the public marina where I 'd bought the boat and began my three-year odyssey at sea . <p> Odysseus was trying to get home ; I was trying to get away from home . Odysseus wanted to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did n't happen . I 'd told Susan I would put in at Hilton Head , and I almost did , but within sight of land , I headed back to sea with just a glance over my shoulder . Clean break . No regrets . <p> I threw the nude photos of Susan on the table , instead of in the fireplace . Maybe she wanted them . <p> I poured more cognac into the dregs of the coffee and took a swallow . <p> I looked up at a large , ornately framed , hand-colored photo portrait of Ethel and George Allard , which hung over the mantel . <p> It was a wedding picture , taken during World War II , and George is dressed in his Navy whites , and Ethel is wearing a white wedding dress of the period . Ethel was quite a looker in her day , and I could see how Susan 's grandfather , Augustus , who was then lord of Stanhope Hall , could cross the class line and fiddle with one of his female servants . It was inexcusable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George , a Stanhope employee , was off to war , protecting America from the Yellow Peril in the Pacific . But , as I found out as a young man during the Vietnam War , and as I 'm discovering with this new war , war tears apart the social fabric of a nation , and you get a lot more diddling and fiddling going on . <p> I stared at Ethel 's angelic face in the photograph . She really was beautiful . And lonely . And George was out of town for a while . And Augustus was rich and powerful . He was not , however , according to family accounts , a conniving and controlling prick like his son , my ex-father-in-law , William . I think Augustus was just horny ( it runs in the Stanhope family ) , and if you look at a picture of Augustus ' wife , Susan 's grandmother , you can see why Augustus strayed . Susan , I guess , got her good looks from her mother , Charlotte , who is still attractive , though brainless . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my children have both , and show no signs of the Stanhope tendency to be off their rockers . I 'd like to say my children take after my side of the family , but my parents are n't good examples of mental health either . I think I was adopted . I hope and pray I was . <p> Actually , my father , Joseph , passed away while I was at sea , and I missed the funeral . Mother has n't forgiven me . But that 's nothing new . <p> And on the subject of children , paternity , and genetics , Ethel and George had one child , a daughter , Elizabeth , who 's a nice woman and who lives in the area . Elizabeth gets her beauty from her mother , but looks enough like George to put my mind at ease about any more Stanhope heirs . <p> I 'm taking the long view of this in terms of my children inheriting some of the Stanhope fortune . They deserve some money for putting up with Grandma and Grandpa all their lives . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my claim on the Stanhope estate-to reimburse me for years of putting up with William 's bullshit-to be frivolous . <p> In any case , there is a history here-my own family goes back three hundred years on Long Island-and this history is entwined like the English ivy that covers the gatehouse and the guest cottage ; interesting to look at from a distance , but obscuring the form and substance of the structure , eventually eating into the brick and mortar . <p> ( Continues ... ) <p>
