<p> MONDAY MEANDERINGS // Sox find a starter : Southpaw // Here 's hoping the White Sox put as much time and effort ( and money ) into the search for a No. 5 starter as they did in coming up with their new mascot Southpaw ( left ) . Unless Southpaw also is going to function as the No. 5 starter . <p> *A friendly reminder to anyone overly concerned with a baseball series in June : You can not consider games before the All-Star break as much bigger than the average contest . It 's that 's simple . The fewer the games , the bigger they become . Which , simply put , means a game in September is bigger than a game in June . If you want to send a message , try Western Union . <p> *The Cubs can only hope Mark Prior can throw roughly half as well tonight in Houston as Roger Clemens has this season at roughly twice Prior 's age . <p> *Judging by Bartolo Colon 's performance for the Angels against the Cubs on Saturday night , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Other than issuing large checks twice a month . And the stud pitcher the Sox signed by not signing Colon is who exactly ? <p> *The change of mind regarding going to the minors on rehabilitation assignment is curious at the very least . Unless Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa thought he was going to be rehabbing at a Westin rather than for a West Tenn . <p> *Despite what some media might report , momentum shifts less in an NBA Finals series than does the ground in California . <p> *Guess it 's safe to say when it comes to leading by example , Cincinnati basketball coach Bob Huggins is not exactly in the driver 's seat . <p> *Gee , if Notre Dame is looking for someone to replace the momentarily racially insensitive Paul Hornung on those Irish football broadcasts , here 's a name : Larry Bird . <p> ALL YOU NEED IS LUVABULLS // Looks like Bulls are loaded with talent-rich supporters // Let Jerry West and all the other great basketball minds survey the talent at the NBA 's predraft camp . <p> Another basketball-related @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auditions . <p> Once again , Quick Hits was there as a media judge to assess the plethora of pulchritude , the divas of dance . <p> More than 200 young women attended Saturday 's event . Less than half that number survived the morning cut to make it to the afternoon session . And less than half that number survived the afternoon cut to make it to this week 's minicamp at which Luvabulls director Cathy Core will trim the roster to 25-28 . <p> This is going to be the year they turn it around , " she told the hopefuls before their exhibition on the United Center floor . Optimism is always a good quality to possess before an audition . <p> And if Bulls coach Scott Skiles could have his players show the enthusiasm ( not to mention a fraction of the footwork ) shown by very pregnant Luvabulls choreographer Kim Tyler , the team might be doing something now other than pondering its No. 3 spot in the NBA draft . <p> For the lucky Luvabulls newcomers , the day started before 9 a.m. and ended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ members who wanted to be this year 's members did not have to attend the morning session . The dozen holdovers who tried out definitely had the look of seasoned veterans , even the ones who had been rookies in 2003-04 . If only it was so simple for basketball players to reach a similar level of accomplishment . <p> Carolyn Paxson , wife of Bulls general manager John Paxson and one of the judges , passed some members of last year 's Luvabulls on her way out of the building after the auditions and stopped to talk briefly to the women who will be part of this week 's minicamp . She told them there was no way she would not want to bring them back . <p> Too bad for the Bulls , their basketball players do n't fall into the same category . <p> TONY AWARD // <p> Finally , La Russa puts family first // For a change , Tony La Russa ( above ) hit the road to be with the home team . <p> As in his family . <p> With upper management 's permission @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night 's game at Texas and missed Sunday 's game against the Rangers so he could attend the graduation of his youngest daughter Bianca Tai La Russa from the University of California-Santa Cruz . <p> Since the first day I managed , my attitude was you do n't take the uniform off unless it 's birth or death , and it 's got to be immediate family , " La Russa told the St. Louis Post-Dispatch . I know looking back I have terrific regrets that I lived that way to the detriment of my family in my situation . <p> I took that responsibility seriously . And with players , I expected the same thing , to the point where I have big regrets . This is one time where my priorities are in order . " <p> ACHES AND GAMES // Navratilova may skip Wimbledon // In the world of tennis singles , Martina Navratilova might be Wimble done . <p> She received a wild card to play singles this month at Wimbledon . It would be the first time since 1994 that she would be doing so at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debut 31 years ago and subsequently won nine singles titles . <p> But after failing to qualify for Wimbledon warmup at Eastbourne , Navratilova is uncertain about her return game . <p> I need to decide whether I 'll take that wild card or not , " Navratilova , 47 , said after a 6-4 , 6-2 loss to Russian Elena Likhovtseva in Sunday 's second round of qualifying . I 've asked for it but I 'll have to see . <p> I 've had a bum knee and then my ankle gave out on me in the middle of the game against Likhovtseva . It just got jammed and the trainer fixed it but I have to loosen these bones . <p> The body is not working as well as it used to . " <p> TOOTSIE ROLLS // <p> Luckily , Kournikova wo n't change looks // Anna Kournikova ( right ) is a busy body . <p> The globe-trotting tennis tootsie/celebrity made an appearance at a charity event in Canada and defeated Gigi Fernandez 6-4 , 7-5 in an exhibition match Saturday at the B.C. Decker Women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night before , Canadian media inquired whether her modeling schedule is tiring . <p> What 's so busy about Sports Illustrated ? " she said of her swimsuit session . It 's three hours ' work . <p> I do very selective things that I enjoy doing . Sports Illustrated is a great magazine and it does n't take much time . It 's fine as long as it does n't interfere with my main goals . " <p> Who knows if those goals include ever becoming more of a tennis force instead of a farce . She is known more for her celebrity and the courting of her than for her oncourt success . <p> If I was n't a tennis player , no one would have ever heard of me , " she said . So I guess one helps the other . What am I going to do , change the way I look or change people 's opinions ? I ca n't go and try to change what everyone 's thinking or doing . I can only do what I think is right for me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // <p> Warner 's wife passes on radio gig // You might say the radio career of Brenda Warner ( below ) has been Kurt-tailed . <p> The wife of Giants quarterback Kurt Warner had been mentioned last week as a viable voice on an ESPN radio station in New York . <p> Brenda had a segment on a St. Louis radio station last season when her husband was with the Rams . She rose to radio prominence by phoning in a couple of times to sports-talk shows . One call led to a rift between the quarterback and Rams coach Mike Martz over an injury on his throwing hand in 2002 . The second call last season probably helped ease the two-time MVP out of town . <p> But Brenda 's representatives turned down an offer from New York 's ESPN-1050 program director Mike Thompson to have a spot on the air . <p> I 'm hopeful that if Kurt is successful with the Giants that she will be more in the forefront , " Thompson told the New York Daily News . And perhaps if Kurt is not successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be outspoken then , too . "
