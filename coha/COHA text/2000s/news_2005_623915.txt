<p> Mike Nolan 's preseason expectation for the 49ers  --  " to take control of the NFC West "  --  was ludicrous on its face . But the thought behind it was exactly what teams must do to succeed in today 's NFL . <p> Before a team can win a championship , it first must win its division . There is no better example than the rise and fall of the Eagles , who were 21-3 in the NFC East while reaching four consecutive NFC championship games , and are 0-3 in the division and all but out of it this year . <p> In 39 years , eight teams have reached the Super Bowl , and four have won it , without winning their division title . But the 2002 realignment of the NFL into eight divisions makes that a significantly more difficult achievement because wild-card teams no longer can get a home game in the playoffs . <p> Of the eight non-division winners that reached the Super Bowl , only one  --  New England in 1985  --  did it by winning three road games in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 49ers ' and Raiders ' divisions of why teams must take care of the division first , before they can harbor championship ambitions . <p> Seattle finished first in the NFC West a year ago , but lost two games to St. Louis during the regular season . Then the Seahawks had the misfortune of drawing the Rams for a first-round playoff game and , guess what , the Rams won again . <p> This year , Seattle has beaten the Rams twice . The Seahawks are 4-0 in division games with only two games left against the 49ers , one of them in two days . Seattle never has gone through an entire season without losing at least one division game but should end that streak this season . Then the Seahawks will try to win a playoff game for the first time in 21 years . <p> In the AFC West , the Raiders already are 0-4 , losing to all three opponents  --  the Broncos , Chiefs and Chargers  --  at home . The Raiders are 2-14 in division games since the start of the 2003 season @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another last-place finish . <p> Unlike the Eagles , New England figures to have at least an outside chance in January because the Patriots are still the best team in their division and not only can make the playoffs , but would open at home if they do . New England has a one-game lead on Buffalo and has won both its division games . But the Patriots will play division opponents in four of their final five games . <p> Division sweeps do n't occur as often as one might think , but they are a good indicator of a team 's strength because no opponent knows a team as well as the ones that it plays twice a year . If a team can handle all its division games , it has to be pretty good . <p> Since the NFL 's 1970 merger with the American Football League , there have been only 20 sweeps of a possible 210 . But 11 of those 20 teams reached the Super Bowl and eight won it , most recently the Rams in 1999 . <p> No team has swept its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times between 1984 and 1997 . Two of those seasons resulted in Super Bowl victories , the other two in NFC Championship Game losses . The Raiders swept their division only once , in their 1976 championship season . <p> Rushing to win : The NFL 's top six teams in rushing yardage have a combined record of 42-12 . The league 's top six teams in passing yardage have a combined record of 20-34 . <p> When it matters : Seattle ranks third in the NFL in red-zone offense and is tied for second in red-zone defense . The Seahawks are the only team in the top six in both categories . The 49ers are tied for 26th in red-zone offense and are alone in 26th in red-zone defense . The Raiders are tied for 21st in red-zone offense and tied for 17th in red-zone defense . <p> Coming out : Arkansas quarterback Matt Jones was the talk of the scouting combine last year , but the only question was where he would fit in the NFL and when he 'd be drafted , because he did n't appear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Jacksonville reached a little when the Jaguars chose Jones with the 21st pick of the first round , but he has come on nicely as a wide receiver . With five catches for 117 yards against Baltimore last Sunday , Jones is now the NFL 's leading rookie receiver with 24 catches for 285 yards and three touchdowns . Second is Brandon Jones , a Tennessee third-rounder , with 21 for 274 and two TDs . <p> Party , but no surprise : With the 25th anniversary of the 49ers ' first Super Bowl championship coming up in 2006 , Eddie DeBartolo is planning a lavish reunion for the 49ers ' Super Bowl teams , probably in Las Vegas in the spring . DeBartolo wants to surprise the players with their invitations , but enough people already know about it that it wo n't be much of a surprise . Knowing DeBartolo , though , it ought to be a pretty good party . <p> New name : Samkon Gado , who scored three touchdowns for the Packers in their victory over Atlanta , was the fifth running back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gado is a rookie free agent from Liberty and a native of Nigeria who was signed by the Packers off the Kansas City practice squad last month . He rushed for 103 yards on 26 carries against the Falcons ; the only negative was two fumbles but both were recovered by Green Bay . The Packers say he 'll start again Monday night . <p> Tough to predict : Most preseason forecasts are based off the previous year 's results , but they have little meaning . Except for Seattle , the teams in first place or tied for first place in the NFC all had losing records last year . And three of last year 's playoff teams  --  the Jets , Packers and Eagles  --  are in last place . <p> Struggling on D : Lost in the hubbub over the idiotic wide receiver and injured Donovan McNabb is this fact about Philadelphia : The Eagles ' defense has permitted 23 touchdowns in 9 games , on pace to permit 41 . Last year , it allowed 29 all season , the year before 30 . <p> Fallen : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brian Billick the offensive coordinator of the Vikings , who scored an NFL record 556 points . Green now is the head coach at Arizona , Billick the head coach at Baltimore . Between them , those two teams have scored 17 touchdowns on offense  --  the same number Seattle running back Shaun Alexander has by himself . <p> Overblown : Ever notice how TV makes every player into the greatest ? The NFL Network 's Rich Eisen , writing on nfl.com last week , referred to Terrell Owens and wrote , " The Eagles will stay the course and go without their Hall of Fame receiver forevermore . " Did anyone even know that Tommy McDonald , who played for the Eagles from 1957-63 , wanted to come back ? <p> Get real . Owens has n't earned a Hall of Fame spot even if he were n't such a jerk . He does n't belong in the same conversation with players like Bob Hayes , Art Monk and Cliff Branch , and they are n't in yet . <p> The ratings <p> TOP 5 <p> 1 .
